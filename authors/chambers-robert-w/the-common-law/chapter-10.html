<p>It was slowly becoming evident to Neville that Valerie's was
the stronger character&mdash;not through any genius for tenacity nor
on account of any domineering instinct&mdash;but because, mistaken
or otherwise in her ethical reasoning, she was consistent, true
to her belief, and had the courage to live up to it. And this
made her convictions almost unassailable.</p>

<p>Slavery to established custom of any kind she smilingly disdained,
refusing to submit to restrictions which centuries of social usage
had established, when such social restrictions and limitations
hampered or annoyed her.</p>

<p>Made conscious by the very conventions designed to safeguard
unconsciousness; made wise by the unwisdom of a civilisation which
required ignorance of innocence, she had as yet lost none of her
sweetness and confidence in herself and in a world which she considered
a friendly one at best and, at worst, more silly than vicious.</p>

<p>Her life, the experience of a lonely girlhood in the world, wide
and varied reading, unwise and otherwise, and an intelligence
which needed only experience and training, had hastened to a premature
maturity her impatience with the faults of civilisation. And in
the honest revolt of youth, she forgot that what she rejected
was, after all, civilisation itself, and that as yet there had
been offered no acceptable substitute for its faulty codification.</p>

<p>To do one's best was to be fearlessly true to one's convictions
and let God judge; that was her only creed. And from her point
of view humanity needed no other.</p>

<p>So she went about the pleasure and happiness of living with a
light heart and a healthy interest, not doubting that all was
right between her and the world, and that the status quo must
endure.</p>

<p>And endless misunderstandings ensued between her and the man
she loved. She was a very busy business girl and he objected.
She went about to theatres and parties and dinners and concerts
with other men; and Neville didn't like it. Penrhyn Cardemon met
her at a theatrical supper and asked her to be one of his guests
on his big yacht, the <em>Mohave</em>, fitted out for the Azores.
There were twenty in the party, and she would have gone had not
Neville objected angrily.</p>

<p>It was not his objection but his irritation that confused her.
She could discover no reason for it.</p>

<p>"It can't be that you don't trust me," she said to him, "so it
must be that you're lonely without me, even when you go to spend
two weeks with your parents. I don't mind not going if you don't
wish me to, Louis, and I'll stay here in town while you visit
your father and mother, but it seems a little bit odd of you not
to let me go when I can be of no earthly use to you."</p>

<p>Her gentleness with him, and her sweet way of reasoning made
him ashamed.</p>

<p>"It's the crowd that's going, Valerie &mdash;Cardemon, Querida,
Marianne Valdez&mdash;where did you meet her, anyway?"</p>

<p>"In her dressing room at the Opera. She's perfectly sweet. Isn't
she all right?"</p>

<p>"She's Cardemon's mistress," he said, bluntly.</p>

<p>A painful colour flushed her face and neck; and at the same instant
he realised what he had said.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a while; he went on with his painting; she,
standing once more for the full-length portrait, resumed her pose
in silence.</p>

<p>After a while she heard his brushes clatter to the floor, saw
him leave his easel, was aware that he was coming toward her.
And the next moment he had dropped at her feet, kneeling there,
one arm tightening around her knees, his head pressed close.</p>

<p>Listlessly she looked down at him, dropped one slim hand on his
shoulder, considering him.</p>

<p>"The curious part of it is," she said, "that all the scorn in
your voice was for Marianne Valdez and none for Penrhyn Cardemon."</p>

<p>He said nothing.</p>

<p>"Such a queer, topsy-turvy world," she sighed, letting her hand
wander from his shoulder to his thick, short hair. She caressed
his forehead thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I suppose some man will say that of me some day.... But that
is a little matter&mdash;compared to making life happy for you....
To be your mistress could never make me unhappy."</p>

<p>"To be your husband&mdash;and to put an end to all these damnable
doubts and misgivings and cross-purposes would make me happy all
my life!" he burst out with a violence that startled her.</p>

<p>"Hush, Louis. We must not begin that hopeless argument again."</p>

<p>"Valerie! Valerie! You are breaking my heart!"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear. You know I am not."</p>

<p>She looked down at him; her lip was trembling.</p>

<p>Suddenly she slid down to the floor and knelt there confronting
him, her arms around him.</p>

<p>"Dearer than all the world and heaven!&mdash;do you think that I am
breaking your heart? You <em>know</em> I am not. You know what
I am doing for your sake, for your family's sake, for my own.
I am only giving you a love that can cause them no pain, bring
no regret to you. Take it, then, and kiss me."</p>

<p>But the days were full of little scenes like this&mdash;of earnest,
fiery discussions, of passionate arguments, of flashes of temper
ending in tears and heavenly reconciliation.</p>

<p>He had gone for two weeks to visit his father and mother at their
summer home near Portsmouth, and before he went he took her in
his arms and told her how ashamed he was of his bad temper at
the idea of her going on the <em>Mohave</em>, and said that she
might go; that he did trust her anywhere, and that he was trying
to learn to concede to her the same liberty of action and of choice
that any man enjoyed.</p>

<p>But she convinced him very sweetly that she really had no desire
to go, and sent him off to Spindrift House happy, and madly in
love; which resulted in two letters a day from him, and in her
passing long evenings in confidential duets with Rita Tevis.</p>

<p>Rita had taken the bedroom next to Valerie's, and together they
had added the luxury of a tiny living room to the suite.</p>

<p>It was the first time that either had ever had any place in which
to receive anybody; and now, delighted to be able to ask people,
they let it be known that their friends could have tea with them.</p>

<p>Ogilvy and Annan had promptly availed themselves.</p>

<p>"This is exceedingly grand," said Ogilvy, examining everything
in a tour around the pretty little sitting room. "We can have
all kinds of a rough house now." And he got down on his hands
and knees in the middle of the rug and very gravely turned a somersault.</p>

<p>"Sam! Behave! Or I'll set my parrot on you!" exclaimed Valerie.</p>

<p>Ogilvy sat up and inspected the parrot.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "I believe I've seen that parrot somewhere."</p>

<p>"Impossible, my dear friend&mdash;unless you've been in my bedroom."</p>

<p>Ogilvy got up, dusted his trowsers, and walked over to the parrot.</p>

<p>"Well it looks like a bird I used to know &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>it
certainly resembles&mdash;" He hesitated, then addressing the bird:</p>

<p>"Hello, Leparello&mdash;you old scoundrel!" he said, cautiously.</p>

<p>"Forget it!" muttered the bird, cocking his head and lifting
first one slate-coloured claw from his perch, then the other;&mdash;"forget
it! Help! Oh, very well. God bless the ladies!"</p>

<p>"<em>Where</em> on earth did you ever before see my parrot?"
asked Valerie, astonished. Ogilvy appeared to be a little out
of countenance, too.</p>

<p>"Oh, I really don't remember exactly where I did see him," he
tried to explain; and nobody believed him.</p>

<p>"Sam! Answer me!"</p>

<p>"Well, where did <em>you</em> get him?"</p>

<p>"José Querida gave Leparello to me."</p>

<p>Annan and Ogilvy exchanged the briefest glance&mdash;a perfectly blank
glance.</p>

<p>"It probably isn't the same bird," said Ogilvy, carelessly. "There
are plenty of parrots that talk&mdash;plenty of 'em named Leparello,
probably."</p>

<p>"Sam, how <em>can</em> you be so untruthful! Rita, hold him tightly
while I pull his ears!"</p>

<p>It was a form of admonition peculiarly distasteful to Ogilvy,
and he made a vain effort to escape.</p>

<p>"Now, Sam, the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth!
Quick, or I'll tweak!"</p>

<p>"All right, then," he said, maliciously, "Querida's got relatives
in Oporto who send him these kind of parrots occasionally. He
names 'em all Leparello, teaches 'em all the same jargon, and&mdash;gives
'em to girls!"</p>

<p>"How funny," said Valerie. She looked at Sam, aware of something
else in his grin, and gave an uncertain little laugh.</p>

<p>He sat down, rubbing his ear-lobes, the malicious grin still
lingering on his countenance. What he had not told her was that
Querida's volcanically irregular affairs of the heart always ended
with the gift of an Oporto parrot. Marianne Valdez owned one.
So did Mazie Gray.</p>

<p>His cynical gaze rested on Valerie reflectively. He had heard
plenty of rumours and whispers concerning her; and never believed
any of them. He could not believe now that the gift of this crimson,
green and sky-blue creature signified anything. Yet Querida had
known her as long as anybody except Neville.</p>

<p>"When did he give you this parrot?" he asked, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, one day just before I was going to Atlantic City. He was
coming down, too, to stay a fortnight while I was there, and come
back with me; and he said that He had intended to give the parrot
to me after our return, but that he might as well give it to me
before I went."</p>

<p>"I see," said Ogilvy, thoughtfully. A few moments later, as he
and Annan were leaving the house, he said:</p>

<p>"It looks to me as though our friend, José, had taken too much
for granted."</p>

<p>"It looks like it," nodded Annan, smiling unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"Too sure of conquest," added Ogilvy. "Got the frozen mitt, didn't
he?"</p>

<p>"<em>And</em> the Grand Cordon of the double cross."</p>

<p>"<em>And</em> the hot end of the poker; yes?"</p>

<p>"Sure; and it's still sizzling." Ogilvy cast a gleeful glance
back at the house:</p>

<p>"Fine little girl. All white. Yes? No?"</p>

<p>"All white," nodded Annan.... "And Neville isn't that kind of
a man, anyway."</p>

<p>Ogilvy said: "So <em>you</em> think so, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. He's crazy about her, and she isn't taking Sundays
out if it's his day in.... Only, what's the use?"</p>

<p>"No use.... I guess Kelly Neville has seen as many artists who've
married their models as we have. Besides, his people are frightful
snobs."</p>

<p>Annan, walking along briskly, swung his stick vigorously:</p>

<p>"She's a sweet little thing," he said.</p>

<p>"I know it. It's going to be hard for her. She can't stand for
a mutt&mdash;and it's the only sort that will marry her.... I don't
know&mdash;she's a healthy kind of girl&mdash;but God help her if she ever
really falls in love with one of our sort."</p>

<p>"I think she's done it," said Annan.</p>

<p>"Kelly!"</p>

<p>"Doesn't it look like it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it will wear off without any harm to either of them. That
little girl is smart, all right; she'll never waste an evening
screaming for the moon. And Kelly Neville is&mdash;is Kelly Neville&mdash;a
dear fellow, so utterly absorbed in the career of a brilliant
and intelligent young artist named Louis Neville, that if the
entire earth blew up he'd begin a new canvas the week after....
Not that I think him cold-hearted&mdash;no, not even selfish as that
little bounder Allaire says&mdash;but he's a man who has never yet
had time to spare."</p>

<p>"They're the most hopeless," observed Annan&mdash;"the men who haven't
time to spare. Because it takes only a moment to say, 'Hello,
old man! How in hell are you?' It takes only a moment to put yourself,
mentally, in some less lucky man's shoes; and be friendly and
sorry and interested."</p>

<p>"He's a pretty decent sort," murmured Ogilvy. "Anyway, that Valerie
child is safe enough in temporarily adoring Kelly Neville."</p>

<p>The "Valerie child," in a loose, rose-silk peignoir, cross-legged
on her bed, was sewing industriously on her week's mending. Rita,
in dishabille, lay across the foot of the bed nibbling bonbons
and reading the evening paper.</p>

<p>They had dined in their living room, a chafing dish aiding. Afterward
Valerie went over her weekly accounts and had now taken up her
regular mending; and there she sat, sewing away, and singing in
her clear, young voice, the old madrigal:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>Let us dry the starting tear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the hours are surely fleeting<br/>
And the sad sundown is near.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All must sip the cup of sorrow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I to-day, and thou to-morrow!<br/>
This the end of every song,<br/>
Ding-dong! Ding-dong!<br/>
Yet until the shadows fall<br/>
Over one and over all,<br/>
Sing a merry madrigal!</em>"

</p>
</div>
<p>Rita, nibbling a chocolate, glanced up:</p>

<p>"That's a gay little creed," she observed.</p>

<p>"Of course. It's the <em>only</em> creed."</p>

<p>Rita shrugged and Valerie went on blithely singing and sewing.</p>

<p>"How long has that young man of yours been away?" inquired Rita,
looking up again.</p>

<p>"Thirteen days."</p>

<p>"Oh. Are you sure it isn't fourteen?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly." Then the sarcasm struck her, and she looked around
at Rita and laughed:</p>

<p>"Of course I count the days," she said, conscious of the soft
colour mounting to her cheeks.</p>

<p>Rita sat up and, tucking a pillow under her shoulders, leaned
back against the foot-board of the bed, kicking the newspaper
to the floor. "Do you know," she said, "that you have come pretty
close to falling in love with Kelly Neville?"</p>

<p>Valerie's lips trembled on the edge of a smile as she bent lower
over her sewing, but she made no reply.</p>

<p>"I should say," continued Rita, "that it was about time for you
to pick up your skirts and run for it."</p>

<p>Still Valerie sewed on in silence.</p>

<p>"Valerie!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, say something!"</p>

<p>"What do you want me to say, dear?" asked the girl, laughing.</p>

<p>"That you are <em>not</em> in danger of making a silly ninny
of yourself over Kelly Neville."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll say that very cheerfully&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Valerie!"</p>

<p>The girl looked at her, calmly amused. Then she said:</p>

<p>"I might as well tell you. I am head over heels in love with
him. You knew it, anyway, Rita. You've known it&mdash;oh, I don't know
how long&mdash;but you've known it. Haven't you?"</p>

<p>Rita thought a moment: "Yes, I have known it.... What are you
going to do?"</p>

<p>"Do?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what do you intend to do about this matter?"</p>

<p>"Love him," said Valerie. "What else can I do?"</p>

<p>"You could try not to."</p>

<p>"I don't want to."</p>

<p>"You had better."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Rita, deliberately, "if you really love him you'll
either become his wife or his mistress; and it's a pretty rotten
choice either way."</p>

<p>Valerie blushed scarlet;</p>

<p>"Rotten&mdash;choice?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. You know perfectly well what your position would
be when his family and his friends learned that he'd married his
model. No girl of any spirit would endure it&mdash;no matter how affable
his friends might perhaps pretend to be. No girl of any sense
would ever put herself in such a false position.... I tell you,
Valerie, it's only the exceptional man who'll stand by you. No
doubt Louis Neville would. But it would cost him every friend
he has&mdash;and probably the respect of his parents. And that means
misery for you both&mdash;because he couldn't conceal from you what
marrying you was costing him&mdash;"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Valerie's lips trembled on the edge of a smile
as she bent lower over her sewing."]</p>

<p>"Rita!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There is no use telling me all this. I know it. He knows I know
it. I am not going to marry him."</p>

<p>After a silence Rita said, slowly: "Did he ask you to?"</p>

<p>Valerie looked down, passed her needle through the hem once,
twice.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, softly, "he asked me."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;you refused?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Rita said: "I like Kelly Neville ... and I love you better, dear.
But it's not best for you to marry him.... Life isn't a very sentimental
affair&mdash;not nearly as silly a matter as poets and painters and
dramas and novels pretend it is. Love really plays a very minor
part in life, Don't you know it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I lived twenty years without it," said Valerie, demurely,
yet in her smile Rita divined the hidden tragedy. And she leaned
forward and kissed her impulsively.</p>

<p>"Let's swear celibacy," she said, "and live out our lives together
in single blessedness! Will you? We can have a perfectly good
time until the undertaker knocks."</p>

<p>"I hope he won't knock for a long while," said Valerie, with
a slight shiver. "There's so much I want to see first."</p>

<p>"You shall. We'll see everything together. We'll work hard, live
frugally if you say so, cut out all frills and nonsense, and save
and save until we have enough to retire on respectably. And then,
like two nice old ladies, we'll start out to see the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Rita! I don't want to see it when I'm too old!"</p>

<p>"You'll enjoy it more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rita! How ridiculous! You've seen more of the world than I have,
anyway. It's all very well for you to say wait till I'm an old
maid; but you've been to Paris&mdash;haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rita. There was a slight colour in her face.</p>

<p>"Well, then! Why must I wait until I'm a dowdy old frump before
I go? Why should you and I not be as happy as we can afford to
be while we're young and attractive and unspoiled?"</p>

<p>"I want you to be as happy as you can afford to be, Valerie....
But you can't afford to fall in love."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it will make you miserable."</p>

<p>"But it doesn't."</p>

<p>"It will if it is love."</p>

<p>"It is, Rita," said the girl, smiling out of her dark eyes&mdash;deep
brown wells of truth that the other gazed into and saw a young
soul there, fearless and doomed.</p>

<p>"Valerie," she said, shivering, "you won't do&mdash;<em>that</em>&mdash;will
you?"</p>

<p>"Dear, I cannot marry him, and I love him. What else am I to
do?"</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;then you'd better marry him!" stammered Rita, frightened.
"It's better for you! It's better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For <em>me</em>? Yes, but how about him?"</p>

<p>"What do you care about him!" burst out Rita, almost incoherent
in her fright and anger. "He's a man; he can take care of himself.
Don't think of him. It isn't your business to consider him. If
he wants to marry you it's his concern after all. Let him do it!
Marry him and let him fight it out with his friends! After all
what does a man give a girl that compares with what she gives
him? Men&mdash;men&mdash;" she stammered&mdash;"they're all alike in the depths
of their own hearts. We are incidents to them&mdash;no matter how they
say they love us. They <em>can't</em> love as we do. They're not
made for it! We are part of the game to them; they are the whole
game to us; we are, at best, an important episode in their careers;
they are our whole careers. Oh, Valerie! Valerie! listen to me,
child! That man could go on living and painting and eating and
drinking and sleeping and getting up to dress and going to bed
to sleep, if you lay dead in your grave. But if you loved him,
and were his wife&mdash;or God forgive me!&mdash;his mistress, the day he
died <em>you</em> would die, though your body might live on. I
know&mdash;<em>I</em> know, Valerie. Death&mdash;whether it be his body
or his love, ends all for the woman who really loves him. Woman's
loss is eternal. But man's loss is only temporary&mdash;he is made
that way, fashioned so. Now I tell you the exchange is not fair&mdash;it
has never been fair&mdash;never will be, never can be. And I warn you
not to give this man the freshness of your youth, the happy years
of your life, your innocence, the devotion which he will transmute
into passion with his accursed magic! I warn you not to forsake
the tranquillity of ignorance, the blessed immunity from that
devil's paradise that you are already gazing into&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rita! Rita! What are you saying?"</p>

<p>"I scarcely know, child. I am trying to save you from lifelong
unhappiness&mdash;trying to tell you that&mdash;that men are not worth it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>There was a silence, then Rita, very pale and quiet, leaned forward,
resting her elbows on her knees and framing her face with her
hands.</p>

<p>"I had my lesson," she said.</p>

<p>"You! Oh, my darling&mdash;forgive me! I did not know&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rita suffered herself to be drawn into the younger girl's impulsive
embrace; they both cried a little, arms around each other, faltering
out question and answer in unsteady whispers:</p>

<p>"Were you married, dearest?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh &mdash;I am <em>so</em> sorry, dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So am <em>I.... </em>Do you blame me for thinking about men
as I do think?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you love&mdash;him?"</p>

<p>"I thought I did.... I was too young to know.... It doesn't matter
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, of course not. You made a ghastly mistake, but it's
no more shame to you than it is to him. Besides, you thought you
loved him."</p>

<p>"He could have made me. I was young enough.... But he let me
see how absolutely wicked he was.... And then it was too late
to ever love him."</p>

<p>"O Rita, Rita!&mdash;then you haven't ever even had the happiness
of loving? Have you?"</p>

<p>Rita did not answer.</p>

<p>"Have you, darling?"</p>

<p>Then Rita broke down and laid her head on Valerie's knees, crying
as though her heart would break.</p>

<p>"That's the terrible part of it," she sobbed&mdash;"I really do love
a man, now.... Not that <em>first</em> one ... and there's nothing
to do about it&mdash;nothing, Valerie, nothing&mdash;because even if he
asked me to marry him I can't, now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And if you had not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"God knows what I would do," sobbed Rita, "I love him so, Valerie
&mdash;I love him so!"</p>

<p>The younger girl looked down at the blond head lying on her knees&mdash;looked
at the pretty tear-stained face gleaming through the fingers&mdash;looked
and wondered over the philosophy broken down beside the bowed
head and breaking heart.</p>

<p>Terrible her plight; with or without benefit of clergy she dared
not give herself. Love was no happiness to her, no confidence,
no sacrifice&mdash;only a dreadful mockery&mdash;a thing that fettered,
paralysed, terrified.</p>

<p>"Does he love you?" whispered Valerie.</p>

<p>"No &mdash;I think not."</p>

<p>"If he did he would forgive."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Love pardons everything," said the girl in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. But never forgets."</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>That was the first confidence that ever had passed between Valerie
West and Rita Tevis. And after it, Rita, apparently forgetting
her own philosophical collapse, never ceased to urge upon Valerie
the wisdom, the absolute necessity of self-preservation in considering
her future relations with Louis Neville. But, like Neville's logic,
Rita's failed before the innocent simplicity of the creed which
Valerie had embraced. Valerie was willing that their relations
should remain indefinitely as they were if the little gods of
convention were to be considered; she had the courage to sever
all relations with the man she loved if anybody could convince
her that it was better for Neville. Marry him she would not, because
she believed it meant inevitable unhappiness for him. But she
was not afraid to lay her ringless hands in his for ever.</p>

<p>Querida called on them and was very agreeable and lively and
fascinating; and when he went away Valerie asked him to come again.
He did; and again after that. She and Rita dined with him once
or twice; and things gradually slipped back to their old footing;
and Querida remained on his best behaviour.</p>

<p>Neville had prolonged the visit to the parental roof. He did
not explain to her why, but the reason was that he had made up
his mind to tell his parents that he wished to marry and to find
out once and for all what their attitudes would be toward such
a girl as Valerie West. But he had not yet found courage to do
it, and he was lingering on, trying to find it and the proper
moment to employ it.</p>

<p>His father was a gentleman so utterly devoid of imagination that
he had never even ventured into business, but had been emotionlessly
content to marry and live upon an income sufficient to maintain
the material and intellectual traditions of the house of Neville.</p>

<p>Tall, transparently pale, negative in character, he had made
it a life object to get through life without increasing the number
of his acquaintances&mdash;legacies in the second generation left him
by his father, whose father before him had left the grandfathers
of these friends as legacies to his son.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "She and Rita dined with him once or twice."]</p>

<p>It was a pallid and limited society that Henry Neville and his
wife frequented&mdash;a coterie of elderly, intellectual people, and
their prematurely dried-out offspring. And intellectual in-breeding
was thinning it to attenuation&mdash;to a bloodless meagreness in which
they, who composed it, conceived a mournful pride.</p>

<p>Old New Yorkers all, knowing no other city, no other bourne north
of Tenth Street or west of Chelsea&mdash;silent, serene, drab-toned
people, whose drawing-rooms were musty with what had been fragrance
once, whose science, religion, interests, desires were the beliefs,
interests and emotions of a century ago, their colourless existence
and passive snobbishness affronted nobody who did not come seeking
affront.</p>

<p>To them Theodore Thomas had been the last conductor; his orchestra
the last musical expression fit for a cultivated society; the
Academy of Music remained their last symphonic temple, Wallack's
the last refuge of a drama now dead for ever.</p>

<p>Delmonico's had been their northern limit, Stuyvesant Square
their eastern, old Trinity their southern, and their western,
Chelsea. Outside there was nothing. The blatancy and gilt of the
million-voiced metropolis fell on closed eyes, and on ears attuned
only to the murmurs of the past. They lived in their ancient houses
and went abroad and summered in some simple old-time hamlet hallowed
by the headstones of their grandsires, and existed as meaninglessly
and blamelessly as the old catalpa trees spreading above their
dooryards.</p>

<p>And into this narrow circle Louis Neville and his sister Lily
had been born.</p>

<p>It had been a shock to her parents when Lily married Gordon Collis,
a mining engineer from Denver. She came to see them with her husband
every year; Collis loved her enough to endure it.</p>

<p>As for Louis' career, his achievements, his work, they regarded
it without approval. Their last great painters had been Bierstadt
and Hart, their last great sculptor, Powers. Blankly they gazed
upon the splendours of the mural symphonies achieved by the son
and heir of all the Nevilles; they could not comprehend the art
of the Uitlanders; their comment was silence and dignity.</p>

<p>To them all had become only shadowy tradition; even affection
and human emotion, and the relationship of kin to kin, of friend
to friend, had become only part of a negative existence which
conformed to precedent, temporal and spiritual, as written in
the archives of a worn-out civilisation.</p>

<p>So, under the circumstances, it was scarcely to be wondered that
Neville hesitated to introduce the subject of Valerie West as
he sat in the parlour at Spindrift House with his father and mother,
reading the <em>Tribune</em> or the <em>Evening Post</em> or poring
over some ancient tome of travels, or looking out across the cliffs
at an icy sea splintering and glittering against a coast of frozen
adamant.</p>

<p>At length he could remain no longer; commissions awaited him
in town; hunger for Valerie gnawed ceaselessly, unsubdued by his
letters or by hers to him.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, the evening before his departure, "would it
surprise you very much if I told you that I wished to marry?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, tranquilly; "you mean Stephanie Swift, I suppose."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Tall, transparently pale, negative in character."]</p>

<p>His father glanced up over his spectacles, and he hesitated;
then, as his father resumed his reading:</p>

<p>"I don't mean Stephanie, mother."</p>

<p>His father laid aside his book and removed, the thin gold-rimmed
spectacles.</p>

<p>"I understand from Lily that we are to be prepared to receive
Stephanie Swift as your affianced wife," he said. "I shall be
gratified. Stephen Swift was my oldest friend."</p>

<p>"Lily was mistaken, father. Stephanie and I are merely very good
friends. I have no idea of asking her to marry me."</p>

<p>"I had been given to understand otherwise, Louis. I am disappointed."</p>

<p>Louis Neville looked out of the window, considering, yet conscious
of the hopelessness of it all.</p>

<p>"Who is this girl, Louis?" asked his mother, pulling the white-and-lilac
wool shawl closer around her thin shoulders.</p>

<p>"Her name is Valerie West."</p>

<p>"One of the Wests of West Eighth Street?" demanded his father.</p>

<p>The humour of it all twitched for a moment at his son's grimly
set jaws, then a slight flush mantled his face:</p>

<p>"No, father."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the Chelsea Wests, Louis?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then we&mdash;don't know them," concluded his father with a shrug
of his shoulders, which dismissed many, many things from any possibility
of further discussion. But his mother's face grew troubled.</p>

<p>"Who is this Miss West?" she asked in a colourless voice.</p>

<p>"She is a very good, very noble, very cultivated, very beautiful
young girl&mdash;an orphan&mdash;who is supporting herself by her own endeavours."</p>

<p>"What!" said his father, astonished.</p>

<p>"Mother, I know how it sounds to you, but you and father have
only to meet her to recognise in her every quality that you could
possibly wish for in my wife."</p>

<p>"<em>Who</em> is she, Louis!" demanded his father, casting aside
the evening newspaper and folding up his spectacles.</p>

<p>"I've told you, father."</p>

<p>"I beg to differ with you. Who is this girl? In what description
of business is she actually engaged?"</p>

<p>The young fellow's face grew red:</p>

<p>"She <em>was</em> engaged in&mdash;the drama."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"She was an actress," he said, realising now the utter absurdity
of any hope from the beginning, yet now committed and determined
to see it through to the bitter end.</p>

<p>"An actress! Louis!" faltered his mother.</p>

<p>There was a silence, cut like a knife by the thin edge of his
father's voice:</p>

<p>"If she <em>was</em> an actress, what is she now?"</p>

<p>"She has helped me with my painting."</p>

<p>"Helped you? How?"</p>

<p>"By&mdash;posing."</p>

<p>"Do you desire me to understand that the girl is an artist's
model!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>His father stared at him a moment, then:</p>

<p>"And is this the woman you propose to have your mother meet?"</p>

<p>"Father," he said, hopelessly, "there is no use in my saying
anything more. Miss West is a sweet, good, generous young girl,
fully my peer in education, my superior in many things.... You
and mother can never believe that the ideas, standards&mdash;even the
ideals of civilisation change&mdash;have changed since your youth&mdash;are
changing every hour. In your youth the word actress had a dubious
significance; to-day it signifies only what the character of her
who wears the title signifies. In your youth it was immodest,
unmaidenly, reprehensible, for a woman to be anything except timid,
easily abashed, ignorant of vital truths, and submissive to every
social convention; to-day women are neither ignorant nor timid;
they are innocent because they choose to be; they are fearless,
intelligent, ambitious, and self-reliant&mdash;and lose nothing in
feminine charm by daring to be themselves instead of admitting
their fitness only for the seraglio of some Occidental monogamist&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Louis! Your mother is present!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, father, I know it! Isn't it possible even for
a man's own mother to hear a little truth once in a while&mdash;"</p>

<p>His father rose in pallid wrath:</p>

<p>"Be silent!" he said, unsteadily; "the subject is definitely
ended."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>It was ended. His father gave him a thin, chilly hand at parting.
But his mother met him at the outer door and laid her trembling
lips to his forehead.</p>

<p>"You won't bring this shame on us, Louis, I know. Nor on yourself,
nor on the name you bear.... It is an honourable name in the land,
Louis.... I pray God to bless you and counsel you, my son&mdash;" She
turned away, adding in a whisper&mdash;"and&mdash;and comfort you."</p>

<p>And so he went away from Spindrift House through a snow-storm,
and arrived in New York late that evening; but not too late to
call Valerie on the telephone and hear again the dear voice with
its happy little cry of greeting&mdash;and the promise of to-morrow's
meeting before the day of duty should begin.</p>

<p>Love grew as the winter sped glittering toward the far primrose
dawn of spring; work filled their days; evening brought the happiness
of a reunion eternally charming in its surprises, its endless
novelty. New, forever new, love seemed; and youth, too, seemed
immortal.</p>

<p>On various occasions when Valerie chanced to be at his studio,
pouring tea for him, friends of his sister came unannounced&mdash;agreeable
women more or less fashionable, who pleaded his sister's sanction
of an unceremonious call to see the great painted frieze before
it was sent to the Court House.</p>

<p>He was perfectly nice to them; and Valerie was perfectly at ease;
and it was very plain that these people were interested and charmed
with this lovely Miss West, whom they found pouring tea in the
studio of an artist already celebrated; and every one of them
expressed themselves and their curiosity to his sister, Mrs. Collis,
who, never having heard of Valerie West, prudently conveyed the
contrary in smiling but silent acquiescence, and finally wrote
to her brother and told him what was being said.</p>

<p>Before he determined to reply, another friend&mdash;or rather acquaintance
of the Collis family&mdash;came in to see the picture&mdash;the slim and
pretty Countess d'Enver. And went quite mad over Valerie&mdash;so much
so that she remained for an hour talking to her, almost oblivious
of Neville and his picture and of Ogilvy and Annan, who consumed
time and cocktails in the modest background.</p>

<p>When she finally went away, and Neville had returned from putting
her into her over-elaborate carriage, Ogilvy said:</p>

<p>"Gee, Valerie, you sure did make a hit with the lady. What was
she trying to make you do?"</p>

<p>"She asked me to come to a reception of the Five-Minute Club
with Louis," said Valerie, laughing. "What <em>is</em> the Five-Minute
Club, Louis?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a semi-fashionable, semi-artistic affair&mdash;one of the
incarnations of the latest group of revolting painters and sculptors
and literary people, diluted with a little society and a good
deal of near-society."</p>

<p>Later, as they were dining together at Delmonico's, he said:</p>

<p>"Would you care to go, Valerie?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you think it best for us to accept such invitations
together."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.... Considering what we are to become to each other
&mdash;I thought&mdash;perhaps the prejudices of your friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned a dull red, said nothing for a moment, then, looking
up at her, suddenly laid his hand over hers where it rested on
the table's edge.</p>

<p>"The world must take us as it finds us," he said.</p>

<p>"I know; but is it quite fair to seek it?"</p>

<p>"You adorable girl! Didn't the Countess seek us&mdash;or rather you?&mdash;and
torment you until you promised to go to the up-to-date doings
of her bally club! It's across to her, now. And as half of society
has exchanged husbands and half of the remainder doesn't bother
to, I don't think a girl like you and a man like myself are likely
to meet very many people as innately decent as ourselves."</p>

</div>
<p>A reception at the Five-Minute Club was anything but an ordinary
affair.</p>

<p>It was the ultra-modern school of positivists where realism was
on the cards and romance in the discards; where muscle, biceps,
and thumb-punching replaced technical mastery and delicate skill;
where inspiration was physical, not intellectual; where writers
called a spade a spade, and painters painted all sorts of similar
bucolic instruments with candour and an inadequate knowledge of
their art; where composers thumped their pianos the harder, the
less their raucous inspiration responded, or maundered incapably
into interminable incoherency, hunting for themes in grays and
mauves and reds and yellows, determined to find in music what
does not belong there and never did.</p>

<p>In spite of its apparent vigour and uncompromising modernity,
one suspected a sub-stratum of weakness and a perversity slightly
vicious.</p>

<p>Colour blindness might account for some of the canvases, strabismus
for some of the draughtmanship; but not for all. There was an
ugly deliberation in the glorification of the raw, the uncouth;
there was a callous hardness in the deadly elaboration of ugliness
for its own sake. And transcendentalism looked on in approval.</p>

<p>A near-sighted study of various masters, brilliant, morbid, or
essentially rotten, was the basis of this cult&mdash;not originality.
Its devotees were the devotees of Richard Strauss, of Huysmans,
of Manet, of Degas, Rops, Louis Le Grand, Forain, Monticelli;
its painters painted nakedness in footlight effects with blobs
for faces and blue shadows where they were needed to conceal the
defects of impudent drawing; its composers maundered with both
ears spread wide for stray echoes of Salome; its sculptors, stupefied
by Rodin, achieved sections of human anatomy protruding from lumps
of clay and marble; its dramatists, drugged by Mallarmé and Maeterlinck,
dabbled in dullness, platitude and mediocre psychology; its writers
wrote as bloodily, as squalidly, and as immodestly as they dared;
its poets blubbered with Verlaine, spat with Aristide Bruant,
or leered with the alcoholic muses of the Dead Rat.</p>

<p>They were all young, all in deadly earnest, all imperfectly educated,
all hard workers, brave workers, blind, incapable workers sweating
and twisting and hammering in their impotence against the changeless
laws of truth and beauty. With them it was not a case of a loose
screw; all screws had been tightened so brutally that the machinery
became deadlocked. They were neither lazy, languid, nor precious;
they only thought they knew how and they didn't. All their vigour
was sterile; all their courage vain.</p>

<p>Several attractive women exquisitely gowned were receiving; there
was just a little something unusual in their prettiness, in their
toilets; and also a little something lacking; and its absence
was as noticeable in them as it was in the majority of arriving
or departing guests.</p>

<p>It could not have been self-possession and breeding which an
outsider missed. For the slim Countess d'Enver possessed both,
inherited from her Pittsburgh parents; and Mrs. Hind-Willet was
born to a social security indisputable; and Latimer Varyck had
been in the diplomatic service before he wrote "Unclothed," and
the handsome, dark-eyed Mrs. Atherstane divided social Manhattan
with a blonder and lovelier rival.</p>

<p>Valerie entering with Neville, slender, self-possessed, a hint
of inquiry in her level eyes, heard the man at the door announce
them, and was conscious of many people turning as they passed
into the big reception room. A woman near her murmured, "What
a beauty!" Another added, "How intelligently gowned!" The slim
Countess Hélène d'Enver, née Nellie Jackson, held out a perfectly
gloved hand and nodded amiably to Neville. Then, smiling fixedly
at Valerie:</p>

<p>"My dear, how nice of you," she said. "And you, too, Louis; it
is very amusing of you to come. José Querida has just departed.
He gave us such a delightful five-minute talk on modernity. Quoting
Huneker, he spoke of it as a 'quality'&mdash;and 'that nervous, naked
vibration'&mdash;"</p>

<p>She ended with a capricious gesture which might have meant anything
ineffable, or an order for a Bronx cocktail.</p>

<p>"What's a nervous, naked vibration?" demanded Neville, with an
impatient shrug. "It sounds like a massage parlour&mdash;not," he added
with respect, "that Huneker doesn't know what he's talking about.
Nobody doubts that. Only art is one delicious bouillabaisse to
him."</p>

<p>The Countess d'Enver laughed, still retaining Valerie's hand:</p>

<p>"Your gown is charming&mdash;may I add that you are disturbingly beautiful,
Miss West? When they have given you some tea, will you find me
if I can't find you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," said Valerie.</p>

<p>At the tea table Neville brought her a glass of sherry and a
bite of something squashy; a number of people spoke to him and
asked to be presented to Valerie. Her poise, her unconsciousness,
the winning simplicity of her manner were noticed everywhere,
and everywhere commented on. People betrayed a tendency to form
groups around her; women, prepared by her unusual beauty for anything
between mediocrity and inanity, were a little perplexed at her
intelligence and candour.</p>

<p>To Mrs, Hind-Willet's question she replied innocently: "To me
there is no modern painter comparable to Mr. Neville, though I
dearly love Wilson, Sorella and Querida."</p>

<p>To Latimer Varyck's whimsical insistence she finally was obliged
to admit that her reasons for not liking Richard Strauss were
because she thought him ugly, uninspired, and disreputable, which
unexpected truism practically stunned that harmless dilettante
and so delighted Neville that he was obliged to disguise his mirth
with a scowl directed at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Did I say anything very dreadful, Kelly?" she whispered, when
opportunity offered.</p>

<p>"No, you darling. I couldn't keep a civil face when you told
the truth about Richard Strauss to that rickety old sensualist."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Her poise, her unconsciousness, the winning simplicity
of her manner were noticed everywhere."]</p>

<p>"I don't really know enough to criticise anything. But Mr. Varyck
<em>would</em> make me answer; and one must say something."</p>

<p>Olaf Dennison, without preliminary, sat down at the piano, tossed
aside his heavy hair, and gave a five-minute prelude to the second
act of his new opera, "Yvonne of Bannalec." The opera might as
well have been called Mamie of Hoboken, for all the music signified
to Neville.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hind-Willet, leaning over the chair where Valerie was seated,
whispered fervently:</p>

<p>"Isn't it graphic! The music describes an old Breton peasant
going to market. You can hear the very click of his sabots and
the gurgle of the cider in his jug. And that queer little slap-stick
noise is where he's striking palms with another peasant bargaining
for his cider."</p>

<p>"But where does Yvonne come in?" inquired Valerie in soft bewilderment.</p>

<p>"He's Yvonne's father," whispered Mrs. Hind-Willet. "The girl
doesn't appear during the entire opera. It's a marvellously important
advance beyond the tonal and graphic subtleties of Richard Strauss."</p>

<p>Other earnest and worthy people consumed intervals of five minutes
now and then; a "discuse,"&mdash;whom Neville insisted on calling a
"disease,"&mdash;said a coy and rather dirty little French poem directly
at her audience, leeringly assisted by an over-sophisticated piano
accompaniment.</p>

<p>"If that's modernity it's certainly naked and nervous enough,"
commented Neville, drily.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's perfectly horrid," murmured Valerie, the blush still
lingering on cheek and brow. "I can't understand how intelligent
people can even think about such things."</p>

<p>"Modernity," repeated Neville. "Hello; there's Carrillo, the
young apostle of Bruant, who makes such a hit with the elect."</p>

<p>"How, Kelly?"</p>

<p>"Realism, New York, and the spade business. He saw a sign on
a Bowery clothing store,&mdash;'Gents Pants Half Off Today,' and he
wrote a poem on it and all Manhattan sat up and welcomed him as
a peerless realist; and dear old Dean Williams compared him to
Tolstoy and Ed. Harrigan, and there was the deuce to pay artistically
and generally. Listen to the Yankee Steinlen in five-minute verse,
dear."</p>

<p>Carrillo rose, glanced carelessly at his type-written manuscript
and announced its title unconcernedly:</p>

<p>  "<em>Mutts In Madison Square</em>.</p>

<p>  "A sodden tramp sits scratching on a bench,   The <em>S.C.D.
</em>cart trails a lengthening stench   Where White Wings scrape
the asphalt; and a breeze   Ripples the fountain and the budding
trees.   Now fat old women, waddling like hogs,   Arrive to exercise
their various dogs;   And 'round and 'round the little mutts all
run,   Grass-maddened, frantic, circling in the sun,   Wagging
and nosing&mdash;see! beneath yon tree   One little mutt meets his
affinity:   And, near, another madly wags his tail   Inquiringly;
but his advances fail,   And, 'yap-yap-yap!' replies the shrewish
tyke,   So off the other starts upon a hike,   Rushing at random,
crazed with sun and air,   Circling and barking out his canine
prayer:</p>

<p>  "'Oh, Lord of dogs who made the Out-of-doors   And fashioned
mutts to gambol on all fours,   Grant us a respite from the city's
stones!   Grant us a grassy place to bury bones!   &mdash;A  
grassy spot to roll on now and then,   Oh, Lord of dogs who also
fashioned men,   Accept our thanks for this brief breath of air,  
And grant, Oh, Lord, a humble mongrel's prayer!'</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>  The hoboe, sprawling, scratches in the sun;   While 'round
and 'round the happy mongrels run."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens," breathed Neville, "that sort of thing may be
modern and strong, but it's too rank for me, Valerie. Shall we
bolt?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I think we'd better," she said miserably. "I don't
think I care for&mdash;for these interesting people very much."</p>

<p>They rose and passed slowly along the walls of the room, which
were hung with "five-minute sketches," which probably took five
seconds to conceive and five hours to execute&mdash;here an unclothed
woman, chiefly remarkable for an extraordinary development of
adipose tissue and house-maid's knee; here a pathological gem
that might have aptly illustrated a work on malformations; yonder
a dashing dab of balderdash, and next it one of Rackin's masterpieces,
flanked by a gem of Stanley Pooks.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room, emerging from a chunk of marble, the
back and neck and one ear of an unclothed lady protruded; and
the sculptured achievement was labelled, "Beatrice Andante."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord," whispered Neville, repressing a violent desire to
laugh. "Beatrice and Aunty! I didn't know he had one."</p>

<p>"Is it Dante's Beatrice, Kelly? Where is Dante and his Aunty?"</p>

<p>"God knows. They made a mess of it anyway, those two&mdash;andante&mdash;which
I suppose this mess in marble symbolises. Pity he didn't have
an aunty to tell him how."</p>

<p>"Louis! How irreverent!" she whispered, eyes sparkling with laughter.</p>

<p>"Shall I try a five-minute fashionable impromptu, dear?" he asked:</p>

<p>  "If Dante'd had an Aunty   Who ante-dated Dante   And scolded
him   And tolded him   The way to win a winner,   It's a cinch
or I'm a sinner,   He'd have taken Trix to dinner,   He'd have
given her the eye   Of the fish about to die,   And folded her,  
And moulded her   Like dough within a pie-  sallow, pallid pie- 
And cooked a scheme to marry her,   And hired a hack to carry
her   To stately Harlem-by-the-Bronx,   Where now the lonely taxi
honks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kelly!" she gasped.</p>

<p>They both were laughing so that they hastened their steps, fearful
of offending, and barely contrived to compose their features when
making their adieux to Mrs. Hind-Willet and the Countess d'Enver.</p>

<p>As they walked east along Fifty-ninth Street, breathing in the
fresh, sparkling evening air, she said impulsively:</p>

<p>"And to think, Louis, that if I had been wicked enough to marry
you I'd have driven you into that kind of society&mdash;or into something
genetically similar!"</p>

<p>His face sobered:</p>

<p>"You could hold your own in any society."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could. But they wouldn't let me."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid to fight it out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear&mdash;at <em>your</em> expense. Otherwise&mdash;" She gazed
smilingly into space, a slight colour in either cheek.</p>
