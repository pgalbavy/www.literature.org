IN the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax 
candles burnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; 
Miss Havisham seated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a 
cushion at her feet. Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was 
looking on. They both raised their eyes as I went in, and both saw 
an alteration in me. I derived that, from the look they interchanged. 

<p>`And what wind,' said Miss Havisham, `blows you here, Pip?' 

<p>Though she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather con- 
fused. Estella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon 
me, and then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her 
fingers, as plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that 
she perceived I had discovered my real benefactor. 

<p>`Miss Havisham,' said I, `I went to Richmond yesterday, to 
speak to Estella; and finding that some wind had blown <I>her</I> here, 
l followed.' 

<p>Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to 
sit down, I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often 
seen her occupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it 
seemed a natural place for me, that day. 

<p>`What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before 
you, presently -- in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will 
not displease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me 
to be.' 

<p>Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in 
the action of Estella's fingers as they worked, that she attended to 
what I said: but she did not look up. 

<p>`I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate dis- 
covery, and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, 
fortune, anything. There are reasons why I must say no more of 
that. It is not my secret, but another's.' 

<p>As I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering 
how to go on, Miss Havisham repeated, `It is not your secret, but 
another's. Well?' 

<p>`When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham; 
when I belonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never 
left; I suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might 
have come -- as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and 
to be paid for it?' 

<p>`Ay, Pip,' replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; 
`you did.' 

<p>`And that Mr Jaggers --' 

<p>`Mr Jaggers,' said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, 
`had nothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my 
lawyer, and his being the lawyer of your patron, is a coincidence. 
He holds the same relation towards numbers of people, and it might 
easily arise. Be that as it may, it did arise, and was not brought 
about by any one.' 

<p>Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no 
suppression or evasion so far. 

<p>`But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at 
least you led me on?' said I. 

<p>`Yes,' she returned, again nodding steadily, `I let you go on.' 

<p>`Was that kind?' 

<p>`Who am I,' cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the 
floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at 
her in surprise, `who am I, for God's sake, that I should be kind?' 

<p>lt was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to 
make it. I told her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst. 

<p>`Well, well, well!' she said. `What else?' 

<p>I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,' I said, to soothe 
her, `in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only 
for my own information. What follows has another (and I hope 
more disinterested) purpose. In humouring my mistake, Miss 
Havisham, you punished -- practised on -- perhaps you will supply 
whatever term expresses your intention, without offence -- your 
self-seeking relations?' 

<p>`I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has 
been my history, that I should be at the pains of entreating either 
them, or you, not to have it so! You made your own snares. I never 
made them.' 

<p>Waiting until she was quiet again -- for this, too, flashed out of 
her in a wild and sudden way -- I went on. 

<p>`I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss 
Havisham, and have been constantly among them since I went to 
London. I know them to have been as honestly under my delusion 
as I myself. And I should be false and base if I did not tell you, 
whether it is acceptable to you or no, and whether you are inclined 
to give credence to it or no, that you deeply wrong both Mr 
Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you suppose them to be 
otherwise than generous, upright, open, and incapable of anything 
designing or mean.' 

<p>`They are your friends,' said Miss Havisham. 

<p>`They made themselves my friends,' said I, `when they supposed 
me to have superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss 
Georgiana, and Mistress Camilla, were not my friends, I think.' 

<p>This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, 
to do them good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, 
and then said quietly: 

<p>`What do you want for them?' 

<p>`Only,' said I, `that you would not confound them with the 
others. They may be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are 
not of the same nature.' 

<p>Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated: 

<p>`What do you want for them?' 

<p>`I am not so cunning, you see,' I said, in answer, conscious that I 
reddened a little, `as that I could hide from you, even if I desired, 
that I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the 
money to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but 
which from the nature of the case must be done without his know- 
ledge, I could show you how.' 

<p>`Why must it be done without his knowledge?' she asked, sett- 
ling her hands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more 
attentively. 

<p>`Because,' said I, `I began the service myself, more than two 
years ago, without his knowledge, and I don't want to be betrayed. 
Why I fail in my ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of 
the secret which is another person's and not mine.' 

<p>She gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on 
the fire. After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by 
the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was 
roused by the collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards 
me again -- at first, vacantly -- then, with a gradually concentrating 
attention. All this time, Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham 
had fixed her attention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been 
no lapse in our dialogue: 

<p>`What else? ' 

<p>`Estella,' said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my 
trembling voice, `you know I love you. You know that I have 
loved you long and dearly.' 

<p>She mised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her 
fingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved 
countenance. I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, 
and from her to me. 

<p>`I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It in- 
duced me to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. 
While I thought you could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained 
from saying it. But I must say it now.' 

<p>Preserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still 
going, Estella shook her head. 

<p>`I know,' said I, in answer to that action; `I know. I have no hope 
that I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may be- 
come of me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, 
I love you. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.' 

<p>Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she 
shook her head again. 

<p>`It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to 
practise on the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me 
through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she 
had reflected on the gravity of what she did. But I think she did 
not. I think that in the endurance of her own trial, she forgot 
mine, Estella.' 

<p>I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, 
as she sat looking by turns at Estella and at me. 

<p>`lt seems,' said Estella, very calmly, `that there are senti- 
ments, fancies -- I don't know how to call them -- which I am not 
able to comprehend. When you say you love me, I know what 
you mean, as a form of words; but nothing more. You address 
nothing in my breast, you touch nothing there. I don't care for 
what you say at all. I have tried to warn you of this; now, have I 
not?' 

<p>I said in a miserable manner, `Yes.' 

<p>`Yes. But you would not be wamed, for you thought I did not 
mean it. Now, did you not think so?' 

<p>`I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, un- 
tried, and beautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.' 

<p>`It is in <I>my</I> nature,' she returned. And then she added, with a 
stress upon the words, `It is in the nature formed within me. I make 
a great difference between you and all other people when I say so 
much. I can do no more.' 

<p>`Is it not true,' said I, `that Bentley Drummle is in town here, 
and pursuing you?' 

<p>`It is quite true,' she replied, referring to him with the indiffer- 
ence of utter contempt. 

<p>`That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he 
dines with you this very day?' 

<p>She seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again 
replied, `Quite true.' 

<p>`You cannot love him, Estella!' 

<p>Her fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather 
angrily, `What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, 
that I do not mean what I say?' 

<p>`You would never marry him, Estella?' 

<p>She looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a 
moment with her work in her hands. Then she said, `Why not tell 
you the truth? I am going to be married to him.' 

<p>I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself 
better than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave 
me to hear her say those words. When I raised my face again, there 
was such a ghastly look upon Miss Havisham's, that it impressed 
me, even in my passionate hurry and grief. 

<p>`Estella, dearest dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead 
you into this fatal step. Put me aside for ever -- you have done so, 
I well know -- but bestow yourself on some worthier person than 
Drummle. Miss Havisham gives you to him, as the greatest slight 
and injury that could be done to the many far better men who ad- 
mire you, and to the few who truly love you. Among those few, 
there may be one who loves you even as dearly, though he has not 
loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can bear it better, for your 
sake!' 

<p>My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would 
have been touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me 
at all intelligible to her own mind. 

<p>`I am going,' she said again, in a gentler voice, `to be married to 
him. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be 
married soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my 
mother by adoption? It is my own act.' 

<p>`Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?' 

<p>`On whom should I fling myself away?' she retorted, with a 
smile. `Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the 
soonest feel (if people do feel such things) that I took nothing to 
him? There! It is done. I shall do well enough, and so will my hus- 
band. As to leading me into what you call this fatal step, Miss 
Havisham would have had me wait, and not marry yet; but I am 
tired of the life I ha ve led, which has very few charms for me, and I 
am willing enough t o change it. Say no more. We shall never un- 
derstand each other.' 

<p>`Such a me an brute, such a stupid brute!' I urged in despair. 

<p>`Don't be afraid of my being a blessing to him,' said Estella; 
`I shall not be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, 
you visionary boy -- or man?' 

<p>`O Estella!' I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, 
do what I would to restrain them; `even if I remained in England 
and could hold my head up with the rest, how could I see you 
Drummle's wife? ' 

<p>`Nonsense,' she returned, `nonsense.  This will pass in no 
time.' 

<p>`Never, Estella!' 

<p>`You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.' 

<p>`Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of my- 
self. You have been in every line I have ever read, since I first came 
here, the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even 
then. You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since -- on 
the river, on the sails of the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in 
the light, in the darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in 
the streets. You have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy 
that my mind has ever become acquainted with. The stones of 
which the strongest London buildings are made, are not more real, 
or more impossible to be displaced by your hands, than your 
presence and influence have been to me, there and everywhere, and 
will be. Estella, to the last hour of my life, you cannot choose but 
remain part of my character, pad of the little good in me, part of the 
evil. But, in this separation I associate you only with the good, and 
I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you must have done 
me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp distress 
I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!' 

<p>In what     of unhappiness I got these broken words out of 
myself, I don't know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood 
from an inward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips 
some lingering moments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I 
remembered -- and soon afterwards with stronger reason -- that 
while Estella looked at me merely with incredulous wonder, the 
spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand still covering her heart, 
seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of piry and remorse. 

<p>All done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I 
went out at the gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker colour 
than when I went in. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes 
and by-paths, and then struck off to walk all the way to London. 
For, I had by that time come to myself so far, as to consider that I 
could not go back to the inn and see Drummle there; that I could 
not bear to sit upon the coach and be spoken to; that I could do 
nothing half so good for myself as tire myself out. 

<p>It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing 
the narrow intricacies of the streets which at that time tended west- 
ward near the Middlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to 
the Temple was close by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was 
not expected till to-morrow, but I had my keys, and, if Herbert 
were gone to bed, could get to bed myself without disturbing him. 

<p>As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate 
after the Temple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, 
I did not take it ill that the night-porter examined me with much 
attention as he held the gate a little way open for me to pass in. To 
help his memory I mentioned my name. 

<p>`I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here's a note, sir. The 
messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by 
my lantern?' 

<p>Much surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed 
to Philip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were 
the words, `PLEASE READ THIS, HERE. I opened it, the watch- 
man holding up his light, and read inside, in Wemmick's writing: 

<p>            DONT GO HOME.
