<p>It is proper, at this point, to introduce some history of the
movements of Mickey O'Rooney, after the separation between himself
and his young friend. The latter, it will be remembered, left
him sleeping upon the Apache blanket, at the bottom of the cave,
while he, the lad, went off in pursuit of the wolf, which came
so near leading him to destruction, but which, in the end, conducted
him to freedom and safety.</p>

<p>The Irishman slept for several hours longer, as soundly as if
he lay in his own bed at home. He was sorely in need of sleep,
and, having convinced himself that there was no danger to be apprehended,
he transferred all his anxiety over to his young friend while
he sailed off into the land of dreams. When he awoke and recalled
where he was, he spoke to Fred; but, receiving no reply, supposed
he was asleep, and passed his hand about in quest of him. After
groping several minutes in vacancy, he muttered:</p>

<p>"Be the powers! if he hasn't fell out of bed, as me brother Tom
used to remark to the ould gintleman, after he'd kicked me out
of the same. The fall ain't far enough to hurt him seriously,
but these laddies have a way of getting hurt, where a man couldn't
do it, if he tried."</p>

<p>After calling and searching further, he struck a match and held
it up. A transient glimpse was gained of an area of several hundred
feet, in which, it is needless to say, he saw nothing of his young
friend.</p>

<p>"Be the powers! but he strayed away," added Mickey, somewhat
impatiently. "He thought there was something that it would pay
to chase, and he's gone off, and, of course, will be lost."</p>

<p>With a view to bringing him back, the Irishman called his name,
whistled, and, after a time, fired his gun. The echoes were not
so loud as when Fred had fired, but the racket was sufficient
to make him confident it would reach the ears of the boy, if he
were not asleep or injured.</p>

<p>Mickey, as will be seen, formed the right opinion of the action
of his young friend, and hoped that he would be able to work his
way back to camp, as they called it, without any mishap or assistance
from him.</p>

<p>"He thinks there's another door that opens into the sunshine,
and that isn't locked, and, if it is, he can pick the kay. He
may work away till he becomes weary, and then he'll be back here,
and we'll hare to contrive some other way, or it may be that good
luck will lead him to the opening for which he sighs. Heaven grant
that the same may be the case."</p>

<p>He waited, and watched, and hoped, as the hours passed by, until
he began to believe that something serious had happened to him.
At intervals he repeated his signals, but on no occasion was there
anything like a response.</p>

<p>It was an odd juxtaposition of events that, at the very moment
he uttered some of the calls, the despairing kid was doing the
same thing, and, although each strained his ears to the utmost,
yet neither suspected the truth.</p>

<p>The hours and the time passed on, until happening to look up
at the opening, Mickey saw the prepared blanket slowly descending,
just as Fred looked upon it from the ridge.</p>

<p>"I'm obliged to yees," he said, in an undertone, "but I don't
find myself in pressing naad of the same. I have one here, but
if ye insist on my taking that, I'll not quarrel with yees."</p>

<p>He resolved that when it came down within his reach he would
cut the lasso, and take it, but before it reached the ground he
had changed his mind.</p>

<p>He knew what the intention of the Apaches was, but he was not
deceived for an instant.</p>

<p>"I'll not do anything at all," he muttered; "I'll not interfere,
where it's so difficult to decide upon me duty, as the owld lady
obsarved when the bear got her husband down. I'll let 'em think
I'm aslaap, and see what they'll do."</p>

<p>And thus, as the reader already knows, the rolled-up blanket
was lowered and raised again without molestation, almost grazing
the upturned face of the Irishman as it did so.</p>

<p>"And the next will be one of the spalpeens himself. Begorrah!
there he is this minute!"</p>

<p>Just as he anticipated, a short time after the blanket began
its descent, enfolding the form of one of the swarthy warriors,
the Irishman at once detecting the ruse.</p>

<p>His rifle was brought to his shoulder, but yielding to a whim,
which he could hardly explain, he lowered it, without firing,
resolved that he would do nothing at all, unless compelled to
in self-defense. About this time an idea began to dawn upon him
that silence and inaction upon his part might do himself more
good than the most vigorous defense.</p>

<p>He might shoot the first Indian, and then the others would only
keep themselves out of reach, and he would be no nearer escape
than before. On the other hand, if he studiously forced himself
into the background, they might begin to believe that he had discovered
the means of exit which was unknown to them. He had no fear of
not being able to keep out of their way, where he had such abundant
room and where no light possibly could reach the interior and
reveal his presence to a hundred searchers. If they chose to attempt
to carry torches, then he could pick them off at his own convenience.</p>

<p>And so it came about that Mickey stood quietly by, and permitted
the whole five Apaches to slide down the rope like so many monkeys,
while he raised no hand in the way of protest. Not knowing how
many the party numbered, he could not conjecture how many were
left when the five had come down, and the business stopped for
the time, but he knew, as a matter of course, that they would
not enter the cave without leaving reinforcements upon the surface.</p>

<p>By the time the last man landed, Mickey had moved back to a point
a hundred yards away from where the group were gathered, where
he was seated upon a large rock.</p>

<p>"If any of 'em undertakes to flash a bull's eye in me face, I
kin dodge down behind the same," was the way in which the Irishman
reasoned it.</p>

<p>At such a time, and in such a place, the faculty of hearing was
about the only one that could be counted upon, and, sliding softly
off the rock, Mickey applied his ear to the earth. If the Apaches
were moving about, the noise made by their feet was so slight
that he could not be certain whether they were actually branching
out and groping for him, or whether they were the sounds produced
by the natural shifting of the feet of a group of men standing
together.</p>

<p>Matters stood thus for some time, when the last Indian suddenly
came through the opening and plumped down upon the ground below,
his start on this journey being such that he was probably considerably
shaken up by the involuntary trip.</p>

<p>"Ye spalpeens must be more careful in coming down-stairs," muttered
Mickey, who supposed that the whole thing was an accident, as
in his own case.</p>

<p>But it was not long before he heard the voice of Fred Munson,
calling from above, and, as each word was distinctly heard, there
was no room for any misunderstanding of the situation. The Irishman
was literally dumfounded.</p>

<p>"Be the powers! if it isn't the most wonderful thing that ever
happened, as Mrs. Murphy remarked when Tim came home sober one
night. That laddy, in hunting around, has struck upon some hole
that leads out, and he's forgot, or else it was so hard to find
his way back to me, he has gone round to that place, and now hollers
down at me.</p>

<p>"Begorrah," added Mickey, a moment later, "it must be that he
shoved that spalpeen overboard, and there isn't anybody left up
there in the way of Apaches but one, and he ain't an Apache, but
a gintleman named Fred Moonson. Here's to his health, and if this
thing gets any more delightful, I'll have to give a whoop and
yell, and strike up the Tipperary jig."</p>

<p>The exultant fellow had hard work to keep his spirits under control
when he fairly understood the brilliant exploit that had been
performed by his young friend.</p>

<p>"It is almost aqual to my gineral coorse," he he added; "but
I must try and hold in till I can get the laddy by himself. Then
I'll hammer him, out of pure love, as ye may say."</p>

<p>Mickey managed to contain himself, but did not attempt to reply
to the direct call which was made upon him. That, in one sense,
would have been fatal, as it would have "uncovered" his position.
The Irishman was quick-witted, and it occurred to him that the
last incident which had happened at the entrance to the cave might
be turned to good account. If he continued to remain in the background,
the Apaches were likely to conclude that he, too, was beyond their
reach.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood until the signal was made to him, when he
deemed it wise to make a cautious reply, merely to apprise the
lad that he was there within call, and understood the situation
through and through.</p>

<p>Mickey was very apprehensive when, some time after, he discovered
that one of the Indians was ascending the rope. He was not so
apprehensive when he came down again. The result of this repulse
was much more decisive than Fred had supposed. The warriors seemed
to suspect that they were throwing away time in attempting to
outwit one who held such an immense advantage over them, and who
was too wide-awake to permit them to steal a march upon him.</p>

<p>The delighted Irishman knew, from the sounds, that the redskins
were moving away from the spot, not with the idea of staying away
altogether, but that they might engage upon a little reconnoissance
which might possibly open the way that they were so anxiously
seeking. One of the redskins passed almost within arm's length
of him, never suspecting, as a matter of course, that he was brought
into such proximity to a mortal enemy. Mickey only breathed until
assured that there was quite a distance between him and the Apaches.</p>

<p>"Now it begins to look as though there's a chance for me," he
concluded; "and if me laddy will let down the lasso, I'll thry
the bootiful experiment of shinning up it, though I much fear
me that it will be the same as a greased pole."</p>

<p>He moved with the utmost circumspection toward the spot, being
able to locate it by means of the moonlit opening overhead, and
when he was near it he halted and listened.</p>

<p>"I don't obsarve that any one is loafing about here, getting
in the way of honest folks."</p>

<p>Just then he ran plump against an Apache, whom he did not suspect
was so near him.</p>

<p>The redskin uttered a grunt of anger, no doubt suspecting that
it was one of his own friends.</p>

<p>As quick as lightning the Irishman drew back and struck a blow
that stretched the warrior senseless.</p>

<p>"I'll tache ye to be grunting around here when a gintleman runs
again ye. Ye ought to be ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>Mickey had already strapped his rifle to his back, and, groping
about, he felt the end of the lasso dangling in front of his face.
The same instant he grasped it and began the ascent.</p>
