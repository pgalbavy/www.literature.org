<p>Two men remained standing on the floor below, and the one who
climbed the hay-mow was Hungerford, Chief of Police of Ashton.
He had struck the trail of the runaways in Jersey City, and when
he learned of three boys that had left the train at New Brunswick,
he was certain they were the young rogues whom he was looking
for.</p>

<p>He hired a horse and wagon in the city, secured the help and
guidance of an officer well acquainted with the country, and by
judicious inquiry retained the trail. He was so far behind the
boys, however, that it was growing dark when he was only half
a dozen miles out of the city, and he was obliged to put up for
the night.</p>

<p>He was at it again before daylight, and the couple used their
wits with such effect that before long they fixed upon the barn
where the boys had taken refuge. An examination of the road and
damp earth revealed the tell-tale footprints, and they applied
to the farmer for his aid in searching the barn.</p>

<p>That gentleman was surprised to find he had forgotten to lock
the stable-door, but such was the fact, and a brief search brought
the runaways to light.</p>

<p>When they recognized the chief of police, they broke down and
cried so pitifully that the heart of the officer was touched.
He cheered them as best he could, and after they were taken to
the house, given a warm breakfast and their clothing was dried,
they felt, as may be said, like giants refreshed with new wine.</p>

<p>All were eager to be taken home. They had had enough of adventure,
and were willing to face any punishment awaiting them, if they
could only see Ashton again. Mr. Hungerford was confident that
the three would receive the chastisement they merited, but he
gave no hint of his belief, and prepared to take them thither.</p>

<p>He paid the farmer for the meal, and then decided to drive back
to New Brunswick, and make the real start from that point.</p>

<p>He had learned of the robbery the boys suffered, and he was determined
to recover the valuable watch of Mr. Wagstaff from thieving Snakeroot
Sam. His brother officer offered to give him all the help possible,
though he warned him that the task would be both difficult and
dangerous, because of the large number of vicious tramps in that
section.</p>

<p>The first thing done, upon reaching New Brunswick, was to telegraph
to Mr. Wagstaff that the runaways were found, with no harm having
befallen them, and they might be expected home that evening. Then,
leaving the boys by themselves, the officers set out for the tramp
rendezvous, where better fortune than they anticipated awaited
them.</p>

<p>Snakeroot Sam was well known to the New Brunswick officer, and
they were fortunate enough to come upon him in the highway, where
he had no companions. He was collared before he suspected their
business, and the watch and chain were found on his person. Inasmuch
as it would have involved considerable delay to bring the scamp
to trial and conviction, besides getting the names of the runaways
in the papers, Chief Hungerford took his satisfaction out of the
tramp personally. The kick administered to Tommy Wagstaff was
repaid with interest. Indeed, there is reason to believe that
Sam felt the effects throughout most of the following summer.
Certain it is that he never received such a shaking up in his
life.</p>

<p>Just as it was growing dark, the boys arrived in Ashton and were
at their respective homes to supper.</p>

<p>And then and there was made a mistake, so serious in its nature
and so far-reaching in its consequences that it forms the basis
of the narrative recorded in the following pages.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that each father concerned declared that,
upon their return home, the boys should receive severe punishment
for their flagrant offenses. Such was their resolve, and yet only
one of the gentlemen carried it out.</p>

<p>Mr. Wagstaff and his wife were so grateful for the restoration
of their son that they accepted his promise to be a better boy,
and, after a mild reproof, he was restored to their grace and
favor.</p>

<p>It was the same with the parents of Jimmy McGovern. He professed
great contrition for his wrong-doing, and several days were devoted
to a consideration of the matter, when he, too, was allowed to
escape all punishment.</p>

<p>Billy Waylett, the youngest and least guilty, was the only one
who suffered at the hands of his father. The latter loved his
child as much as any parent could, and he felt more pain in inflicting
the chastisement than did the lad in receiving it. But it was
given from a sense of duty, and, as is always and invariably the
case, the boy respected his parent for what he did. He knew he
deserved it, and that it was meant for his own good.</p>

<p>What was the consequence? It marked a turning-point in the life
of the lad. He comprehended, as never before, his narrow escape
from disgrace and ruin, and from that time forward became obedient,
studious, and pure in thoughts, words, and deeds. He gave his
parents and teachers no trouble, and developed into a worthy young
man, who became the pride and happiness of his relatives.</p>

<p>Tommy and Jimmy chuckled together many times over their good
fortune. They saw how indulgent their parents were, and enjoyed
the mock heroism which attended a full knowledge of their exploit.</p>

<p>They did not give up their hopes of a life of adventure, and
became dissatisfied with the dull humdrum routine of Ashton. They
were content, however, to bide their time, and to wait till they
became older before carrying out the projects formed years before.
The seed unwittingly sown by their thoughtless parents was sure
to bring its harvest sooner or later.</p>

<p>Two years after the runaway incidents the parents of Tommy Wagstaff
and Jimmy McGovern removed to the city of New York, and in that
great metropolis the boys were not long in finding bad associates.
The preliminary steps were taken in their education which eventuated
in the incidents that follow.</p>
