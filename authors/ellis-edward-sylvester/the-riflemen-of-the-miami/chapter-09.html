The woodcock, in his moist retreat,<br/>
Heard not the falling of their feet;<br/>
On his dark roost the gray owl slept,<br/>
Time, with his drum the partridge kept;<br/>
Nor left the deer his watering-place,<br/>
So hushed, so noiseless was their pace.

<p>On a fine summer day, the one succeeding that upon which occurred
the incident just related, one of the Riflemen of the Miami, was
making his way through the dense forests that at that period nearly
covered the entire portion of Ohio. His short stature, bowed legs,
and round, shining visage, showed unmistakably that he was Tom
O'Hara. His rifle was slung over his shoulder, and as he walked
leisurely along, he had that easy, saucy air which showed him
to be totally unmindful of the opinion of friend or foe. That
he had no fears of disturbance was manifest from the carelessness
with which he proceeded, constantly kicking the leaves before
him, and when a limb brushed his face, suddenly stopping and spitefully
wrenching it off with an expression of impatience. He was in a
worse temper than usual, and incensed at something that continually
occupied his mind.</p>

<p>"What can have become of the fools?" he muttered. "He oughter
been home two, three days ago, and we hain't seen a sign of him
yet. Can't be Lew's such a dunce as to walk into the red-skins'
hands. No, no, no."</p>

<p>He shook his head as if displeased, and for a time continued
his solitary journey in silence. The great question which he was
debating was regarding his leader's whereabouts, and his ill-temper
arose principally from the fact that he was unable to offer a
solution satisfactory to himself.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he added. "If Lew is took, why the gal's took,
and if the gal's took, Lew must be too; so that p'int is settled.
It <em>might</em> be some of the Injins <em>have</em> got him,
but somehow or other I can't believe it. Don't look reasonable,
although Dick 'peared to think so."</p>

<p>Again he bent his head as if in deep thought. Gradually his meditations
brought him nearer the truth.</p>

<p>"He's found out that the shortest path was the safest one&mdash;something
a man is pretty apt to think when he is with the gal he loves,
and so he has took the roundabout way home. That's it, sure. But
hold on a minute," said O'Hara, as a new thought struck him; "I'd
like to know the route which it would take them so long to travel
over. It's queer, I'll be hanged if it isn't. That gal will be
the death of Lew yet. I'd like to see the gal that could pull
the wool over <em>my</em> eyes."</p>

<p>And, as if alarmed at the thought, he strode rapidly forward,
shaking his head, and muttering more savagely than ever to himself.
Gradually he regained his natural state of semi-composure, and
proceeded in his audible musings:</p>

<p>"Whatever is up, I'm bound to find out afore I go back. Not that
I care a cent for Lew&mdash;not a bit of it. If he don't know any better
than to shut his eyes when Injins is about, he oughter suffer.
But then I'd like to know <em>how things is</em>. Hello!"</p>

<p>The Rifleman stopped and commenced snuffing the air, like an
animal when it scents danger.</p>

<p>"That's smoke, as sure as I live. Who's been kindling a fire
at this time of day?"</p>

<p>Turning his head in every direction, he, at length, determined
the one from which the vapor came. There being scarcely any wind
at all, he rightly judged it must be close at hand. Stealing carefully
along from tree to tree, he finally detected the faint blue rising
through the wood, scarcely fifty yards away. Approaching still
closer, he gained a full view of the fire, and also of him who
had kindled it. The latter was an Indian warrior, who was seated
on the ground with his legs gathered under him, and his head bowed
forward as if sleeping. The hunter saw, from the nodding of his
head, that such was the case. Occasionally he would incline forward
until ready to fall on his face, when he would start up with a
jerk, rub his eyes, look about him, and then go to nodding again.</p>

<p>"It seems that everybody have lost their senses," muttered O'Hara.
"Now just see that Injin wagging his head at the fire, tryin'
to sleep here in broad daylight. How easy I could send a bullet
through him! But there's no danger of that, as we Riflemen don't
fight in that style. Be careful, my fellow."</p>

<p>Here the Indian fell over on his face and then scrambled to his
feet, looked around, seeking to appear wondrously awake, and then
sat down as before.</p>

<p>"A Huron, as I live," said O'Hara, in pleased astonishment. "What
can <em>that</em> red-skin mean by being in these parts? All alone,
too. If he was only Oonamoo, now, I'd feel glad to see him."</p>

<p>Oonamoo, to whom the hunter alluded, was a Huron scout, well
known along the frontier as one of the best friends the whites
possessed. He had the shrewdness, cunning and skill of his people
in an astonishing degree, and had many times given evidence of
his faithfulness to the settlers. He was well known to the Riflemen
of the Miami, having guided them in several expeditions, and with
O'Hara especially he was on good terms. The anxiety of the latter,
therefore, to meet him can be well understood.</p>

<p>"Oonamoo would unravel the whole thing afore noon," said he,
"and I'd about as lief see him this minute as I would see Lew.
Let me get a better glimpse of his face. I didn't suspect him
being a Huron when he jumped up just now, or I'd noticed his features.
It don't look like Oonamoo, to see him noddin' in that style."</p>

<p>He moved cautiously around, until fairly in front of the savage,
when he uttered a low, peculiar whistle. The latter instantly
raised his head, his black eyes open to their fullest extent,
and gave a look that at once discovered his identity to O'Hara.</p>

<p>"Oonamoo, and no mistake," he muttered; and then repeating the
whistle as a warning that he was about to approach, he stepped
boldly forth and revealed himself. The Huron started with surprise,
and then advanced with an expression of pleasure to greet his
white brother.</p>

<p>"Glad to meet," he said, speaking brokenly.</p>

<p>"And I'm derned glad to see you, Oonamoo, for I need your help
this minute. What are you doing? Out on a scout?"</p>

<p>The Huron shook his head.</p>

<p>"No scout &mdash;Oonamoo live in woods&mdash;like the deer&mdash;can't
sleep near white men's houses."</p>

<p>"'Pears you can sleep here though, the way your head was bobbin'
around. Been up late at night, I s'pose?"</p>

<p>"No sleep now&mdash;meet 'Hara, white brother," said he, with an expression
of joy upon his swarthy countenance.</p>

<p>"Yes, I smelt the smoke of your fire, and follerin' it up I cone
onto you. 'Pears to me it was rather careless kindling your fire
here in broad daylight. Ain't there any Injins in the neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"Woods full of 'em &mdash;Shawnees, Miamis, Delawares, all over,
like leaves of trees," replied the savage, sweeping his arm around
him.</p>

<p>"Ain't you <em>afeard</em> they might come down on you?"</p>

<p>The Rifleman indulged in an inward laugh, for he well knew the
reply that would be made. The dark face of the Huron assumed an
expression of withering scorn as he answered:</p>

<p>"Oonamoo don't know <em>fear</em>&mdash;spit on Shawnee and Miami&mdash;he
sleeps in their hunting-grounds, and by their wigwams, but they
don't touch him. He scalp their warriors&mdash;all he meets, but Oonamoo
never lose scalp."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that; that proud top-knot of yours may
be yanked off yet, Mr. Oonamoo. Many a Shawnee would be proud
to have that hanging in his lodge."</p>

<p>"He never get him though," replied the Huron, with great readiness.</p>

<p>"I hope not, for I'd feel sorry to see such a good warrior as
you go under when he is needed so much. You ain't on a scout or
hunt just now, then?"</p>

<p>The savage shook his head from side to side as quick as lightning.</p>

<p>"Then you'll take a tramp with me?"</p>

<p>It now went up and down with the same celerity.</p>

<p>"To sum up then, Oonamoo, Lew, our leader, is in a bad scrape."</p>

<p>"Shawnee got him? Miami got him?"</p>

<p>"That's what I want to find out. Shouldn't be s'prised if both
have nabbed him."</p>

<p>"How get him?"</p>

<p>There was something curious in the eagerness with which the Huron
asked the questions. It was more noticeable from the fact that
O'Hara spoke slowly and deliberately, so that the short, broken
sentences of the savage seemed all the more short and broken.</p>

<p>"That I can't tell, Oonamoo," repeated the hunter, who, it will
be noticed, evinced the remarkable fact of being in a good temper
with the Indian. "You see, him and the gal&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Gal with him?" asked the savage, with amazing quickness.</p>

<p>"Yes; didn't I tell you that?"</p>

<p>"Bad&mdash;bad&mdash;gal make him blind&mdash;see notting, all time&mdash;she afore
his face."</p>

<p>"You've got the idea this time, Oonamoo. Lew's in love, above
his head and ears, and can't be to blame so much for what he's
done," said O'Hara, a gleam of pity stealing through his rough
nature, like a ray of sunshine entering a gloomy cave. "He's made
a fool of himself, I'm afeard, 'cause there's a female on his
hands."</p>

<p>"What want to do? Foller him&mdash;catch him?"</p>

<p>"That's it. The first thing to be done is to find the trail."</p>

<p>"Where lost? Where see him last?"</p>

<p>O'Hara proceeded to relate as best he could what is already known
to the reader, or more properly that portion of it which was known
to him. He stated that he and Dick Allmat had lost the trail in
a small brook, and that their most persistent efforts had failed
to recover it. Upon speculating further, he learned from Oonamoo
that they were in the vicinity of the ravine where Dernor and
Edith had so narrowly escaped the Indians, the latter fact of
course being unknown to them. The Huron added, that there was
"much track" in the woods around them, and O'Hara, thinking that
perhaps his leader's might be among them, proposed that they should
make an examination of them. To this the savage readily agreed,
and the two moved forward through the wood for that purpose.</p>

<p>In the course of a few minutes they reached the ravine, and the
Indian, pointing down into it, as they stood upon its bank, said:</p>

<p>"Full of tracks&mdash;many Injin pass there."</p>

<p>"Let us go down and take a look at them."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, they were following up the ravine, on a
sort of half-run, the Huron leading the way, and evincing, at
nearly every step, that remarkable quickness of sight and comprehension
so characteristic of his race. Suddenly he paused so abruptly
that O'Hara ran against him.</p>

<p>"What the deuce is the matter?" he asked, rubbing his nose.</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>Several dark drops of blood were visible on the ground which
was also torn up by the feet of the combatants. As the reader
probably suspects, this was the scene of the conflict between
Dernor and the Miami Indian.</p>

<p>"See," said Oonamoo, walking slowly around, and pointing to the
ground. "Track of Injin&mdash;track of white man&mdash;tear up ground&mdash;fight&mdash;till
Injin killed. White man then run&mdash;see him tracks there, there,
there," he added, pointing further and further from him as he
uttered each of the last three words.</p>

<p>"But where's the gal?"</p>

<p>The Huron pointed to the spot where Edith had stood spell-bound
while the contest was going on. O'Hara, although a skillful backwoodsman,
was not equal to his savage companion; but he saw at once, from
the dainty impress of the earth, that he was correct in supposing
that Edith had stood there. They now resumed their pursuit, the
hunter bringing all his wood-craft into play, in order to keep
up with his companion.</p>

<p>"I can't see her tracks to save my life," said the former, after
they had proceeded some distance.</p>

<p>"Him carry her," replied the savage, without the least hesitation.</p>

<p>"Hang me if you haven't got about as much brains as a person
needs in these parts," muttered O'Hara, admiringly, as he imitated
the monotonous trot of the savage. A moment later and he paused
again.</p>

<p>"What's up now?" asked the hunter.</p>

<p>"Track gone."</p>

<p>"But I see plenty in front of us."</p>

<p>"White man's not there&mdash;gone."</p>

<p>A minute examination revealed the fact that most of the impressions
were now made by persons passing <em>backward</em> as well as
forward, as though confusion had arisen from some cause. O'Hara
suspected the reason of this, but, without venturing an opinion,
questioned his dusky friend:</p>

<p>"Huntin' for tracks," he answered. "White man gone."</p>

<p>The two now walked slowly backward, their gaze wandering along
the sides of the ravine instead of the bottom. In a moment the
quick eye of the Indian discerned the spot where he judged the
exit had been made, and a short examination proved that he was
right. The feet of Dernor had sunk deep in the soft earth as he
made his Herculean efforts in the ascent, while those of his pursuers
were so light that they hardly disturbed them.</p>

<p>Up out of the ravine came the Huron and hunter, and into the
woods they plunged, following the trail now with the greatest
readiness. A short distance further they reached the banks where
Edith had concealed herself, and here, for a time, even the red-skin
was at fault. He saw that the shrubbery had been passed by most
of the pursuers without their having approached closely enough
to make an examination. From the circuit which Dernor had made
to reach these bushes, the quick-witted Huron rightly suspected
that he had turned them to some account. Accordingly, he cautiously
parted them and looked in. An immediate "Ugh!" showed O'Hara that
he had made some discovery.</p>

<p>"Hide gal there&mdash;then run on."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Injin didn't git her in bushes," replied the savage, implying
that if she was captured at all it was not done here.</p>

<p>"Go on, then," added O'Hara.</p>

<p>It was now noticed that the steps of the fugitive had shortened,
it following, as a natural consequence, that he had slackened
his speed at this point. Several hundred yards further on, another
fact was observed. The pursuing Indians, instead of adhering to
the trail, as they had done heretofore, separated and left it.
This, to both Oonamoo and O'Hara was evidence that they had either
come in sight of Dernor, or else were so certain of the direction
he was taking that they did not deem it necessary to watch his
footsteps. The Rifleman could not believe the former was the case,
inasmuch as it was the very thing, above all others, which his
leader would seek to avoid; for the most requisite condition to
the success of his artifice, was that his pursuers should still
think Edith was with him. Be that as it may, one thing was certain.
The pursuer and pursued at this point were very close together&mdash;closer
than the safety of the latter could admit for any length of time.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards further, the dark face of the Huron lit up
with an expression of admiring pleasure.</p>

<p>"Him run agin," said he, glancing to O'Hara, who was now beside
him.</p>

<p>The steps of the flying Rifleman now lengthened rapidly, as if
he had traveled at superhuman speed. As O'Hara saw the remarkable
leaps which he must have taken, he could not help exclaiming,
in admiration: "Go it, Lew. I'd like to see the red-skin that
could overhaul you, when you're a mind to bring your pegs down
to it."</p>

<p>"Run much&mdash;like scar't deer," added Oonamoo.</p>

<p>"Yes, <em>sir</em>; Lew has been letting out just along here,
and I reckon them Injins never seen such steps as he took."</p>

<p>It was very evident that the hunter had "let out" to his utmost
ability, and with the determination of leaving his pursuers far
in the rear. Previous to this he had not called his formidable
power into play; but so rapidly had his gait increased that in
many places his footsteps were fully ten feet apart!</p>

<p>It had not escaped the notice of Oonamoo and O'Hara, that a white
man was among the pursuers, and it occasioned considerable speculation
upon the part of the latter. The trails of the two were distinguishable,
Dernor having a small, well-shaped foot, inclining outward very
slightly, while that of the other was large, heavy, turning outward
at a very large angle.</p>

<p>"Who can this chap be?" asked O'Hara of his companion.</p>

<p>"Renegade&mdash;bad white man &mdash;Girty&mdash;white chief."</p>

<p>"Whew! I see how it is now. That's the dog that hung around the
settlers on the night of the storm, and got fired at a dozen times."</p>

<p>"Why no killed&mdash;no hurt?"</p>

<p>"We didn't know who he was, and all shot at his breast."</p>

<p>"Ugh! no hurt him, then."</p>

<p>"No, for, they say, the dog often wears a bullet-proof plate
over his breast, and his life has, more than once, been saved
by it. He's a brave man, for all he's such an inhuman brute; for
who would dare to sit and let us fire agin and agin at him, when
it was just as likely we'd fire at his head as at his breast?
It was more of an accident than any thing else that we didn't
kill him."</p>

<p>"Bad man&mdash;kill women and children," said Oonamoo.</p>

<p>"No one disputes that. What a pity we didn't know him when we
first set eyes on him. I shouldn't wonder now if he's been fooling
Lew, as well as us. My gracious! hasn't the boy used his pegs
along here?" exclaimed O'Hara, again looking at the ground.</p>

<p>"No catch him," said the Huron. "No Injun run like him. Tracks
turn round pretty soon."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"Gal bring him back&mdash;not leave <em>her</em>!"</p>

<p>"You're right. He won't forget she is behind him. But how is
he going to throw the dogs off the scent?"</p>

<p>"How t'row white men off scent, eh?"</p>

<p>"I understand&mdash;by taking to the water."</p>

<p>"Take to water agin."</p>

<p>As the Huron spoke, they came upon the edge of a second brook&mdash;one,
in fact, large enough to be called a creek. The trail led directly
into this, it being manifest that Dernor had so shaped his flight
as to reach it.</p>

<p>"I will cross over and examine the opposite side, while you do
the same along this shore."</p>

<p>"No, won't," replied Oonamoo, with a decided shake of his head.
"White man no cross&mdash;gal behind him&mdash;come out on this side agin."</p>

<p>The savage was so certain of this, that he refused even to allow
O'Hara to enter the stream. A moment's reflection convinced him,
also, that the supposition was correct, and they commenced their
ascent of the bank. They had gone scarcely a dozen steps, when
they came upon numerous moccasin-tracks, showing that, if the
pursuers had crossed the creek, they had also returned. At this
discovery, Oonamoo indulged in a characteristic exclamation:</p>

<p>"He hide trail&mdash;all safe&mdash;no cotch him."</p>

<p>"How are <em>we</em> going to find it?" asked O'Hara.</p>

<p>Marvelous as was the skill of the Huron, he doubted his own ability
to regain the trail in the ordinary manner, and he accordingly
had resort to the same means that he used in ascending the ravine.
Without attempting to search for the trail itself, he carefully
examined the shore in order to find the point at which the fugitive
could safely leave the stream. Oonamoo, from his knowledge of
the leader of the Riflemen, knew that he would walk for miles
in the creek, before he would leave it without the certainty of
deceiving his pursuers. The course which Dernor had taken being
such that he had entered the water at a point considerably <em>above</em>
where Edith had concealed herself, the savages, in case they were
aware that the latter was somewhere on the back-trail, would naturally
suppose that, if he came out of it on the same side in which he
had entered, it would be <em>below</em> this point; which, all
being comprehended by the Huron, satisfied him that the fugitive
had disappointed these expectations, and gone <em>up</em> the
stream.</p>

<p>Two things, therefore, were determined with considerable certainty
&mdash;Dernor had not <em>crossed</em> the creek, but had left
at a point either near or above where Oonamoo and O'Hara were
standing. Satisfied of this, the two moved along the bank, taking
long, leaping steps, treading so lightly as barely to leave the
impression of their feet, and scrutinizing each bank with the
most jealous eye.</p>

<p>They had ascended fully a half-mile without discovering any thing
upon which "to hang a suspicion," when O'Hara, who had contrived
to get in advance of the Huron, uttered a suppressed exclamation
of surprise.</p>

<p>"Here's where he could have come out," said he.</p>

<p>Oonamoo looked carefully before him, and shook his head. The
object in question consisted of a fallen tree, the top of which
lay in the edge of the stream, while the upturned roots were nearly
a hundred feet distant. It will be seen at once, that the hunter
could easily have walked along the trunk of this without leaving
a visible footprint, and leaped off into the woods from the base
and continued his flight as before. Plain as was this to the Huron,
another fact was still plainer&mdash;the Rifleman had done no such
thing.</p>

<p>"Why do you think he hasn't used this tree?" asked O'Hara.</p>

<p>"Too plain&mdash;<em>Injin sure to t'ink he do it.</em>"</p>

<p>Oonamoo had told the exact truth, for Dernor had really approached
the branches of the tree with the intention of using them as we
have hinted, when he had seen that his pursuers would be sure
to suspect such an artifice, from the ready means afforded him;
and he had, therefore, given over his first resolve, and continued
his ascent of the creek.</p>

<p>All around the base were the imprints of moccasins, showing where
the Shawnees and Miamis had searched and failed to find the trail.
Oonamoo having noticed all this, in far less time than it has
taken us to relate it, walked out on the tree-trunk as far as
it would allow him without wetting his feet Standing thus, he
leaned over and peered out into the water.</p>

<p>"Look dere&mdash;knowed it," said he, pointing out a few feet from
the shore. The water was semi-translucent, so that it required
a keen view to discover the object of the Huron's gaze; but, following
the direction of his finger, O'Hara made out to discover on the
bottom of the creek the <em>sign</em> left by the passage of a
human foot. They were not <em>impressions</em>, because there
was not a dent visible, the ground being entirely free from any
thing like it; but there were two delicate, yet perfect <em>outlines</em>
of a moccasin. The hunter had stood a few moments on this spot,
and then stepped into deeper water. The tracks thus left by his
feet had gradually filled with the muddy sediment composing the
bottom of the creek, until, as we have said, there were no <em>impressions</em>
left; but, completely around where they had once been, ran a dark
line, as if traced by the hand of an artist, a complete outline
of the hunter's foot. This faint, almost invisible, evidence of
his passage had entirely escaped the eyes of his pursuers.</p>

<p>"What I t'ought," said Oonamoo; "knowed dey'd t'ink he'd come
out dere&mdash;go in water agin&mdash;come out furder up-stream."</p>

<p>"By thunder," said O'Hara, in amazement, "you make me ashamed
of myself, Oonamoo. I believe you could track the gray eagle through
air. Come, now, where is Lew? you can tell, if you're a mind to."</p>

<p>This extravagant compliment was entirely lost upon the stolid
Huron. He appeared not to hear it. He merely repeated, "He come
out furder up," and, springing lightly from the tree, continued
his cautious ascent of the creek, O'Hara following behind, and
occasionally muttering his unbounded admiration of the Indian's
astonishing skill.</p>

<p>The opposite side of the stream was overhung almost entirely
with the heavy undergrowth so characteristic of the western forests.
Beneath this it would have been an easy matter for a foe to have
concealed himself and to fire upon the hunter and Indian; but
the latter scarcely deigned to look across, well knowing that
no such a danger threatened them. While the savages were searching
for the trail of the fugitive, Oonamoo was certain that, as yet,
no one knew that any one was upon theirs. Even had they known
it, they would have cared but little, for they were too formidable
a body to fear the two men who were following them.</p>

<p>All along the shore were numerous moccasin-tracks, showing how
persistently the Indians had kept up the pursuit. It struck O'Hara
that his leader must have walked pretty rapidly through the creek
to keep out of sight of the enemies, for they, being upon the
land, had nothing to retard their progress. The causes of his
success in this matter were twofold. In the first place, the extraordinary
speed at which he had run had placed him far in advance of his
pursuers, upon reaching the creek, so that he had ascended it
a good distance before they reached it; and, unlike the shrewd
Huron, they were deceived by the artifice he had practiced, believing
that he had either crossed the stream, or gone down it. In this
manner he gained a start sufficient to accomplish all he desired.</p>

<p>O'Hara was just on the point of framing his mouth to ask a suppressed
question, when Oonamoo, who was several feet in advance, suddenly
paused and raised his hand over his head, as a signal that silence
and caution were now necessary.</p>
