<p>It was August when Alexander met Hannele.  She was walking under a
chintz parasol, wearing a dress of blue cotton with little red
roses, and a red silk apron.  She had no hat, her arms were bare
and soft, and she had white stockings under her short dress.  The
Herr Regierungsrat was at her side, large, nimble, and laughing
with a new witticism.</p>

<p>Alexander, in a light summer suit and Panama hat, was just coming
out of the bank, shoving twenty thousand kronen into his pocket.
He saw her coming across from the Amtsgericht, with the Herr
Regierungsrat at her side, across the space of sunshine.  She was
laughing, and did not notice him.</p>

<p>She did not notice till he had taken off his hat and was saluting
her.  Then what she saw was the black, smooth, shining head, and
she went pale.  His black, smooth, close head - and all the blue
Austrian day seemed to shrivel before her eyes.</p>

<p>'How do you do, Countess!  I hoped I should meet you.'</p>

<p>She heard his slow, sad-clanging, straying voice again, and she
pressed her hand with the umbrella stick against her breast.  She
had forgotten it - forgotten his peculiar, slow voice.  And now it
seemed like a noise that sounds in the silence of night.  Ah, how
difficult it was, that suddenly the world could split under her
eyes, and show this darkness inside.  She wished he had not come.</p>

<p>She presented him to the Herr Regierungsrat, who was stiff and
cold.  She asked where the captain was staying.  And then, not
knowing what else to say, she said:</p>

<p>'Won't you come to tea?'</p>

<p>She was staying in a villa across the lake.  Yes, he would come to
tea.</p>

<p>He went.  He hired a boat and a man to row him across.  It was not
far.  There stood the villa, with its brown balconies one above the
other, the bright red geraniums and white geraniums twinkling all
round, the trees of purple clematis tumbling at one corner.  All
the green window doors were open: but nobody about.  In the little
garden by the water's edge the rose trees were tall and lank, drawn
up by the dark green trees of the background.  A white table with
chairs and garden seats stood under - the shadow of a big willow
tree, and a hammock with cushions swung just behind.  But no one in
sight.  There was a little landing bridge on to the garden: and a
fairly large boat-house at the garden end.</p>

<p>The captain was not sure that the boat-house belonged to the villa.
Voices were shouting and laughing from the water's surface, bathers
swimming.  A tall, naked youth with a little red cap on his head
and a tiny red loin-cloth round his slender young hips was standing
on the steps of the boat-house calling to the three women who were
swimming near.  The dark-haired woman with the white cap swam up to
the steps and caught the boy by the ankle.  He cried and laughed
and remonstrated, and poked her in the breast with his foot.</p>

<p>'Nein, nein, Hardu!' she cried as he tickled her with his toe.
'Hardu!  Hardu!  H&ouml;r' auf! - Leave off!' - and she fell with a crash
back into the water.  The youth laughed a loud, deep laugh of a lad
whose voice is newly broken.</p>

<p>'Was macht er dann?' cried a voice from the waters.  'What is he
doing?'  It was a dark-skinned girl swimming swiftly, her big dark
eyes watching amused from the water surface.</p>

<p>'Jetzt Hardu h&ouml;r' auf.  Nein.  Jetzt ruhig!  Now leave off!  Now be
quiet.'  And the dark-skinned woman was climbing out in the
sunshine onto the pale, raw-wood steps of the boathouse, the water
glistening on her dark-blue, stockinette, soft-moulded back and
loins: while the boy, with his foot stretched out, was trying to
push her back into the water.  She clambered out, however, and sat
on the steps in the sun, panting slightly.  She was dark and
attractive-looking, with a mature beautiful figure, and handsome,
strong woman's legs.</p>

<p>In the garden appeared a black-and-white maid-servant with a tray.</p>

<p>'Kaffee, gn&auml;dige Frau!'</p>

<p>The voice came so distinct over the water.</p>

<p>'Hannele!  Hannele!  Kaffee!' called the woman on the steps of the
bathing-house.</p>

<p>'Tante Hannele!  Kaffee!' called the dark-eyed girl, turning round
in the water, then swimming for home.</p>

<p>'Kaffee!  Kaffee!' roared the youth, in anticipation.</p>

<p>'Ja - a!  Ich kom - mm,' sang Hannele's voice from the water.</p>

<p>The dark-eyed girl, her hair tied up in a silk bandana, had reached
the steps and was climbing out, a slim young fish in her close dark
suit.  The three stood clustered on the steps, the elder woman with
one arm over the naked shoulders of the youth, the other arm over
the shoulders of the girl.  And all in chorus sang:</p>

<p>'Hannele!  Hannele!  Hannele!  Wir warten auf dich.'</p>

<p>The boatman had left off rowing, and the boat was drifting slowly
in.  The family became quiet, because of the intrusion.  The
attractive-looking woman turned and picked up her blue bath-robe,
of a mid-blue colour that became her.  She swung it round her as if
it were an opera cloak.  The youth stared at the boat.</p>

<p>The captain was watching Hannele.  With a white kerchief tied round
her silky, brownish hair, she was swimming home.  He saw her white
shoulders and her white, wavering legs below in the clear water.
Round the boat fishes were suddenly jumping.</p>

<p>The three on the steps beyond stood silent, watching the intruding
boat with resentment.  The boatman twisted his head round and
watched them.  The captain, who was facing them, watched Hannele.
She swam slowly and easily up, caught the rail of the steps, and
stooping forward, climbed slowly out of the water.  Her legs were
large and flashing white and looked rich, the rich, white thighs
with the blue veins behind, and the full, rich softness of her
sloping loins.</p>

<p>'Ach!  Sch&ouml;n!  'S war sch&ouml;n!  Das Wasser ist gut,' her voice was
heard, half singing as she took her breath.  'It was lovely.'</p>

<p>'Heiss,' said the woman above.  'Zu warm.  Too warm.'</p>

<p>The youth made way for Hannele, who drew herself erect at the top
of the steps, looking round, panting a little and putting up her
hands to the knot of her kerchief on her head.  Her legs were
magnificent and white.</p>

<p>'Kuck de Leut, die da bleiben,' said the woman in the blue wrap, in
a low voice.  'Look at the people stopping there.'</p>

<p>'Ja!' said Hannele negligently.  Then she looked.  She started as
if in fear, looked round, as if to run away, looked back again, and
met the eyes of the captain, who took off his hat.</p>

<p>She cried in a loud, frightened voice:</p>

<p>'Oh, but - I thought it was TOMORROW!'</p>

<p>'No - today,' came the quiet voice of the captain over the water.</p>

<p>'TODAY!  Are you sure?' she cried, calling to the boat.</p>

<p>'Quite sure.  But we'll make it tomorrow if you like,' he said.</p>

<p>'Today!  Today!' she repeated in bewilderment.'  No!  Wait a
minute.'  And she ran into the boat-house.</p>

<p>'Was ist es?' asked the dark woman, following her.  'What is it?'</p>

<p>'A friend - a visitor - Captain Hepburn,' came Hannele's voice.</p>

<p>The boatman now rowed slowly to the landing-stage.  The dark woman,
huddled in her blue wrap as in an opera-cloak, walked proudly and
unconcernedly across the background of the garden and up the steps
to the first balcony.  Hannele, her feet slip-slopping in loose
slippers, clutching an old yellow wrap round her, came to the
landing-stage and shook hands.</p>

<p>'I am so sorry.  It is so stupid of me.  I was sure it was
tomorrow,' she said.</p>

<p>'No, it was today.  But I wish for your sake it had been tomorrow,'
he replied.</p>

<p>'No.  No.  It doesn't matter.  You won't mind waiting a minute,
will you?  You mustn't be angry with me for being so stupid.'</p>

<p>So she went away, the heelless slippers flipping up to her naked
heels.  Then the big-eyed, dusky girl stole into the house: and
then the naked youth, who went with sang-froid.  He would make a
fine, handsome man: and he knew it.</p>
