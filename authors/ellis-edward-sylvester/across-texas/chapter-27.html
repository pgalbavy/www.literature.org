<p><em>THE </em>presence of the Apaches within a short distance
of the building brought about a complication for which the rescue
party were as unprepared as were the whites within the structure.
But for them, one of Nick’s friends would have ridden forward
and opened a conversation with Rickard, by which the terms of
the exchange could have been effected with little delay. Herbert
told Strubell that unless the criminal demanded an exorbitant
price, it should be accepted. Although he had only a small amount
of funds with him, he would give him a draft that would be honored
without question by Mr. Lord in San Antonio; and if Rickard kept
his part of the agreement, it would be respected by Herbert and
his companions, who were governed by a sense of honor that would
prevent any advantage being taken of circumstances that must of
necessity be in their favor.</p>

<p>But if one of the party advanced to open communication, he would
be observed by the watchful Apaches before a safe point was reached.
Since Rickard must know of the presence of the red men, it was
likely he would admit such an applicant the moment he saw his
danger, but a sudden dash of the warriors might shut him out from
the refuge.</p>

<p>The man would not allow the whole party to enter, inasmuch as
that would disarrange his own plans, though he was not apt to
object to the visit of one of their number. As yet, he could not
have learned that the white men were behind the elevation of the
prairie.</p>

<p>The simple question, therefore, was as to how Strubell and his
companions could negotiate with Rickard without betraying themselves
to the Apaches. Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that the
situation of the three men and boy was extremely dangerous. They
were on the open prairie, and liable to be discovered by the red
men, even with the exercise of the extremest care on their own
part. Such discovery was almost certain to be followed by a desperate
fight, with the chances overwhelmingly against our friends.</p>

<p>This will be conceded when it is remembered that Geronimo and
his fierce miscreants, who defied our forces in the Southwest
so long, never numbered more than a fractional part of the white
soldiers. Those Apaches are born fighters, and the most dangerous
Indians that ever trod the American continent. A dozen of them,
well mounted, would make short work of three white men and one
boy, no matter how bravely they might defend themselves. Eph Bozeman
and the Texan friends were sure to do well and would tumble more
than one of their assailants from the saddle, but their own ultimate
destruction was inevitable.</p>

<p>The situation being as I have shown, it will be seen that the
presence of the Apaches immeasurably increased the peril. It was
agreed that no movement should be made until nightfall, up to
which time the main object would be to avoid discovery by the
swarthy raiders.</p>

<p>This was so important that Strubell and Lattin made their way
back to where the ponies were grazing, and forced all of them
to lie down. The four were so well trained that they readily obeyed.
They would keep that posture, though suffering from hunger, until
ordered to rise. There was no water within reach, a deprivation
which the men felt as much as did the animals.</p>

<p>It should be stated that the words of Strubell about the plans
of Bell Rickard gave Herbert a reasonable explanation of the course
of Nick Ribsam, which, until then, was as much of a puzzle as
the conduct of his captors. Doubtless he had been convinced from
the words and action of his party that his life was not in immediate
danger, and he therefore refrained from increasing their enmity
by any attempt at escape. Had a good chance presented, he would
have been quick to take it, but he was carefully watched and he
bided his time.</p>

<p>Returning from the animals, the Texans lay down on the grass
beside Herbert and Bozeman, and resumed watching the Apaches,
with an occasional study of the front of the building for signs
of the party behind the walls.</p>

<p>The Indians remained grouped in close order for nearly half an
hour. Then one of their number galloped off for a hundred yards
or more, circled about, and returned. Shortly after, a couple
did the same thing.</p>

<p>"Do you know what that means?" asked Eph of Herbert.</p>

<p>"I have no idea."</p>

<p>"It doesn’t mean nothin’; it’s hard for a redskin to set still,
though he can do it for hours at a stretch when he sees a chance
of lifting any ha’r. Them chaps, and their ponies too, get tired
of stayin’ in one spot, so they take a little spurt like that
to set thar blood goin’. Thar they go again!"</p>

<p>The party broke apart, and soon the whole company were circling
about and back and forth like a lot of equestrians in a circus
ring. They doubled in and out, in the most bewildering fashion,
but the men, who devoted themselves to watching them closely,
agreed that there were about a dozen, as at first supposed.</p>

<p>These exhibitions of horsemanship were of special interest to
the party lying down behind the elevation, for the Apaches needed
not to extend their circling far to pass behind the ridge, when
they would be sure to discover them. And just about that time,
as Strubell expressed it, the band would begin to play.</p>

<p>The red men rode so far to the eastward more than once that this
discovery seemed inevitable. It caused much anxiety, and our friends
withdrew their attention for a time from the building and kept
it upon their more active enemies.</p>

<p>The situation was peculiarly trying to Herbert Watrous, who understood
his danger in case of an attack from the Apaches. He would be
perilously placed because of his inexperience. In fact, it struck
him more than once that Nick had much the better of it as compared
with him.</p>

<p>The one fortunate thing was that the afternoon was near to its
close, and the night must lessen the danger, so far as the Apaches
were concerned.</p>

<p>The latter were acting out their ferocious nature. When they
knew the adobe building was empty, it possessed no attraction
to them. They passed it by without so much as firing a shot at
its gray walls, but, when they saw three horsemen ride through
the broad entrance, they halted, and began laying their plans
for destroying them. That’s Apache nature, but perhaps, after
all, it is not so different to the nature of the white man.</p>

<p>It was decided by the Texans that Eph Bozeman should ride forward
to meet Bell Rickard. His relations with the horse thieves insured
against the distrust they were likely to feel in the case of either
of the others. He would doubtless be admitted without misgiving,
and once within the building, he could complete arrangements for
the ransom of Nick Ribsam.</p>

<p>It was Eph’s choice to go on foot, though in the event of detection
by the Apaches his case was likely to be hopeless, whereas, if
he were mounted on his fleet plug, he might dash off and escape.</p>

<p>That which decided the old trapper was the greater liability
of being discovered if he rode a horse. The Apaches were certain
to manœuvre about the building in the darkness, searching for
a way of making a stealthy inroad on the defenders, and it was
too much to expect them to fail to see a horseman seeking entrance
through the regular avenue. Instead of walking erect, he would
creep on his hands and knees, from the moment he reached the rim
of the danger circle until he knocked at the door. By this course,
though it involved much delay, he could use his marvellous expertness,
trained to the highest point by a half century among the wilds
of the Great West.</p>

<p>Old Eph had done the same thing before. He and Kit Carson once
crept a full mile, over the cactus plains in Southern California,
to elude a band of Navajoes that had followed them for several
days and nights, and the injuries received during that ordeal
were felt for months afterward.</p>

<p>He was glad of the chance to repeat the difficult feat, for he
had lived an adventurous life too long to lose his liking for
it, now that he was growing old. Besides, such persons are unwilling
to admit any failure of their powers until the proof is forced
upon them so impressively that it is impossible to deceive themselves.</p>
