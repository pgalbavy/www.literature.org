<p>Siegmund had shaved and dressed, and come down to breakfast. Mrs Curtiss
brought in the coffee. She was a fragile little woman, of delicate,
gentle manner.</p>

<p>'The water would be warm this morning,' she said, addressing no one in
particular.</p>

<p>Siegmund stood on the hearth-rug with his hands behind him, swaying from
one leg to the other. He was embarrassed always by the presence of the
amiable little woman; he could not feel at ease before strangers, in his
capacity of accepted swain of Helena.</p>

<p>'It was,' assented Helena. 'It was as warm as new milk.'</p>

<p>'Ay, it would be,' said the old lady, looking in admiration upon the
experience of Siegmund and his beloved. 'And did ye see the ships of
war?' she asked.</p>

<p>'No, they had gone,' replied Helena.</p>

<p>Siegmund swayed from foot to foot, rhythmically.</p>

<p>'You'll be coming in to dinner today?' asked the old lady.</p>

<p>Helena arranged the matter.</p>

<p>'I think ye both look better,' Mrs. Curtiss said. She glanced at
Siegmund.</p>

<p>He smiled constrainedly.</p>

<p>'I thought ye looked so worn when you came,' she said sympathetically.</p>

<p>'He had been working hard,' said Helena, also glancing at him.</p>

<p>He bent his head, and was whistling without making any sound.</p>

<p>'Ay,' sympathized the little woman. 'And it's a very short time for you.
What a pity ye can't stop for the fireworks at Cowes on Monday. They are
grand, so they say.'</p>

<p>Helena raised her eyebrows in polite interest. 'Have you never seen
them?' she asked.</p>

<p>'No,' replied Mrs. Curtiss. 'I've never been able to get; but I hope to
go yet.'</p>

<p>'I hope you may,' said Siegmund.</p>

<p>The little woman beamed on him. Having won a word from him, she was
quite satisfied.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said brightly, 'the eggs must be done by now.'</p>

<p>She tripped out, to return directly.</p>

<p>'I've brought you,' she said, 'some of the Island cream, and some white
currants, if ye'll have them. You must think well of the Island, and
come back.'</p>

<p>'How could we help?' laughed Helena.</p>

<p>'We will,' smiled Siegmund.</p>

<p>When finally the door was closed on her, Siegmund sat down in relief.
Helena looked in amusement at him. She was perfectly self-possessed in
presence of the delightful little lady.</p>

<p>'This is one of the few places that has ever felt like home to me,' she
said. She lifted a tangled bunch of fine white currants.</p>

<p>'Ah!' exclaimed Siegmund, smiling at her.</p>

<p>'One of the few places where everything is friendly,' she said. 'And
everybody.'</p>

<p>'You have made so many enemies?' he asked, with gentle irony.</p>

<p>'Strangers,' she replied. 'I seem to make strangers of all the people I
meet.'</p>

<p>She laughed in amusement at this <span style="text-decoration: underline">mot</span>. Siegmund looked at her intently.
He was thinking of her left alone amongst strangers.</p>

<p>'Need we go - need we leave this place of friends?' he said, as if
ironically. He was very much afraid of tempting her.</p>

<p>She looked at the clock on the mantelpiece and counted: 'One, two,
three, four, five hours, thirty-five minutes. It is an age yet,'
she laughed.</p>

<p>Siegmund laughed too, as he accepted the particularly fine bunch of
currants she had extricated for him.</p>
