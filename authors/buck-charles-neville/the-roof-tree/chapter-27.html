<p>Parish Thornton had used all his persuasion to prevent Dorothy's going
with him to Virginia. He had argued that the solace of feeling her
presence in the courtroom would hardly compensate for the unnerving
effect of knowing that the batteries of the prosecution were raining
direct fire on her as well as on himself.
</p>
<p>Twice, while he had waited the summons that must call him to face his
ordeal, the attorney who was to defend him had come over into Kentucky
for conference, and it was to the professional advice of this lawyer,
almost clairvoyant in his understanding of jury-box psychology, that
Dorothy had at last yielded.
</p><p>"We'll want to have you there later on," he had told the wife. "Juries
are presumed to be all logic; in fact, they are two-thirds emotion--and
if you appear for the first time in that courtroom at precisely the
right moment with your youth and wholesomeness and loyalty, your arrival
will do more for your husband than anything short of an alibi. I'll send
for you in due season--but until I do, I don't want you seen there."
</p><p>So Dorothy had stayed anxiously at home.
</p><p>One crisp and frosty morning she went over to Jake Crabbott's store
where she found the usual congregation of loungers, and among them was
Bas Rowlett leaning idly on the counter.
</p><p>Dorothy made her few purchases and started home, but as she left the
store the man upon whom she had declared irreconcilable war strolled out
and fell into step at her side. She had not dared to rebuff him before
those witnesses who still accounted them friends, but she had no relish
for his companionship and when they had turned the bend of the road she
halted and faced the fellow with determined eyes.
</p><p>About them the hills were taking on the slate grays and chocolate tones
of late autumn and the woods were almost denuded of the flaunting
gorgeousness which had so recently held carnival there, yet the sodden
drabness of winter had in nowise settled to its monotony, for through
the grays and browns ran violet and ultramarine reflexes like soft and
creeping fires that burned blue, and those few tenacious leaves that
clung valiantly to their stems were as rich of tone as the cherry-dark
hues that come out on well-coloured meerschaum.
</p><p>"I didn't give ye leave ter walk along with me, Bas," announced the girl
with a spirited flash in her eyes, and her chin tilted high. "I've got a
rather es ter ther company I keeps."
</p><p>The man looked at her for a hesitant interval without answering, and in
his dark face was a mingling of resentment, defiance, and that driving
desire that he thought was love.
</p><p>"Don't ye dast ter trust yoreself with me, Dorothy?" he demanded with a
smile that was half pleading and half taunt, and he saw the delicate
colour creep into her cheeks and make them vivid.
</p><p>"I hain't afeared of ye," she quickly disavowed. "Ever sence thet other
time when ye sought ter insult me, I've done wore my waist
bloused--a-purpose ter tote a dirk-knife. I've got hit right now," and
her hand went toward her bosom as she took a backward step into the
brittle weed-stalks that grew by the roadside.
</p><p>But Bas shook his head, and hastened to expound his subtler meaning.
</p><p>"I didn't mean ye war skeered of no bodily vi'lence, Dorothy. I means
ye don't das't trust yoreself with me because ye're affrighted lest ye
comes ter love me more'n ye does ther man ye married in sich unthoughted
haste. I don't blame ye fer bein' heedful."
</p><p>"Love ye!" she exclaimed, as the colour deepened in her cheeks and neck,
then went sweeping out again in the white and still passion of outraged
indignation. "I hain't got no feelin' fer ye save only ter despise ye
beyond all measure. A woman kain't love no craven an' liar thet does his
fightin' by deceit."
</p><p>Bas Rowlett looked off to the east and when he spoke it was with no
reference to the insults that cut most deeply and sorely into mountain
sensibilities.
</p><p>"A woman don't always know what she loves ner hates--all at onc't.
Betwixt them two things thar hain't no sich great differ noways. I'd
ruther hev ye hate me then not ter give me no thought one way ner
t'other.... Ye're liable ter wake up some day an' diskiver thet ye've
jest been gittin' ther names of yore feelin's mixed up." He paused in
his exposition upon human nature long enough to smile indulgently, then
continued: "So long es ye won't abide ter let me even talk te yer, I
knows ye're afear'd of me in yore heart--an' thet's because ye're
afeared of what yore heart hitself mout come ter feel."
</p><p>"Thet's a right elevatin' s'armon ye preaches," she made scornful
answer, "but a body doesn't gentle a mad dog jest ter show they hain't
skeered of hit."
</p><p>"Es fer Parish Thornton," he went on as though his musings were by way
of soliloquy, "ye kain't handily foller him whar he's goin' ter, nohow.
He's done run his course already."
</p><p>A hurricane gust of dizzy wrath swept the woman and her voice came
explosively: "Thet's a lie, Bas Rowlett! Hit'll be <u>you</u> thet dies with
a rope on yore neck afore ye gits through--not him!"
</p><p>"Ef I does," declared the man with equanimity, "hit won't be jest yit. I
grants him full an' free right of way ter go ahead of me."
</p><p>But abruptly that cool and disconcerting vein of ironic calm left him
and he bent his head with the sullen and smouldering eyes of a vicious
bull.
</p><p>"But be thet es hit may. I claims thet ye kain't stand out erginst my
sweetheartin' ef ye trusts yoreself ter see me. <u>You</u> claims
contrariwise, but ye don't dast test yore theory. I loves ye an' wants
ye enough ter go on eatin' insults fer a spell.... Mebby ther Widder
Thornton'll listen ter reason--when ther jury an' ther hangman gits
done."
</p><p>The girl made no answer. She could not speak because of the fury that
choked her, but she turned on her heel and he made no effort to follow
her.
</p><p>The steeply humped mountains on either side seemed to Dorothy Thornton
to close in and stifle her, and the bracing, effervescent air of the
high places had become dead and lifeless in her nostrils, as to one who
smothers.
</p><p>That evening, when Sim Squires came in to supper, he made casual
announcement that he understood Bas had gone away somewhere. His vapid
grin turned to a sneer as he mentioned Rowlett's name after the
never-failing habit of his dissembling, but Dorothy set down his plate
as though it had become suddenly too hot to hold.
</p><p>"Whar did he go?" she demanded with a gasp in her voice, and the hired
man, drawing his platter over, drawled out his answer in a tone of
commonplace:
</p><p>"Nobody didn't seem ter know much erbout hit. Some 'lowed he'd fared
over ter Virginny ter seek ter aid Parish in his trial." He paused, then
with well-feigned maliciousness he added, "but ef I war inter any
trouble myself, I'd thank Bas Rowlett ter keep his long fingers outen my
affairs."
</p><p>Gone to help Parish! Dorothy drew back and leaned against the wall with
knees grown suddenly weak. She thought she knew what that gratuitous aid
meant!
</p><p>Parish fighting for his life over there in the adjoining state faced
enemies enough at his front without having assassins lurking in the
shadows at his back!
</p><p>Perhaps Bas had not actually gone yet. Perhaps he could be stopped.
Perhaps her rebuff that morning had goaded him to his decision. If he
had not gone he must not go! The one thought that seemed the crux of her
vital problem was that so long as he remained here he could not be
there.
</p><p>And if he had not actually set out she could hold him here! His amazing
egotism was his one vulnerable point, the single blind spot on his
crafty powers of reasoning--and that egotism would sway and bend to any
seeming of relenting in her.
</p><p>She was ready to fight for Parish's life in whatever form the need
came--and she had read in the old Bible how once Judith went to the tent
of Holifernes.
</p><p>Dorothy shuddered as she recalled the apocryphal picture of the woman
who gave herself to the enemy, and she lay wide-eyed most of that night
as she pondered it.
</p><p>She would not give herself, of course. The beast's vanity was strong
enough to be content with marking, as he believed, the signs of her
gradual conversion. She would fence with him and provoke him with a
seeming disintegration of purpose. She would dissemble her abhorrence
and aversion, refashioning them first into indulgent toleration, then
into the grudging admission that she had misjudged him. She would
measure her wit against his wit--but she would make Kentucky seem to him
too alluring a place to abandon for Virginia!
</p><p>When she rose at dawn her hands clenched themselves at her sides. Her
bosom heaved and her face was set to a stern dedication of purpose.
</p><p>"I'll lead him on an' keep him hyar," she whispered in a voice that she
would hardly have recognized as her own had she been thinking at all of
the sound of voices. "But afore God in Heaven, I'll kill him fer hit
atter-ward!"
</p><p>So when Rowlett, who had really gone only on a neighbourhood journey,
sauntered idly by the house the next afternoon near sunset, Dorothy was
standing by the stile and he paused tentatively in the road. As though
the conversation of yesterday had not occurred, the man said:
</p><p>"Howdy, Dorothy," and the girl nodded.
</p><p>She was not fool enough to overplay her hand, so her greeting was still
disdainful, but when he tarried she did not send him away. It was,
indeed, she who first referred to their previous encounter.
</p><p>"When I come home yistidday, Bas," she said, "I sot down an' thought of
what ye said ter me an' I couldn't holp laughing."
</p><p>"Is thet so?" he responded. "Wa'al what seems ridic'lous to one body
sometimes seems right sensible ter another."
</p><p>"Hit sounded mighty foolish-like ter me," she insisted, then, as if in
after thought, she added, "but I'd hate mightily ter hev ye think I
wasn't willin' ter give ye all ther rope ye wants ter hang yoreself
with. Come on over, Bas, whenever ye've a mind ter. Ef ye kin convert
me, do hit--an' welcome."
</p><p>There was a shade of challenge in the voice such as might have come from
the lips of a Carmen, and the man's pulses quickened.
</p><p>Almost every day after that found Bas Rowlett at the house and the
evenings found him pondering his fancied progress with a razor-edged
zest of self-complacency.
</p><p>"She'll hold out fer a spell," he told himself with large optimism.
"But ther time'll come. When an apple gits ripe enough hit draps offen
ther limb."
</p><hr/>
<p>Over at the small county seat to the east the squat brick "jail-house"
sat in the shadow of the larger building. There was a public square at
the front where noble shade trees stood naked now, and the hitching
racks were empty. Night was falling over the sordid place, and the
mountains went abruptly up as though this village itself were walled
into a prison shutting it off from outer contacts.
</p><p>The mired streets were already shadowy and silent save for the whoop of
a solitary carouser, and the evening star had come out cold and distant
over the west, where an amber stretch of sky still sought feebly to hold
night apart from day.
</p><p>Through the small, grated window of one of the two cells which that
prison boasted, Parish Thornton stood looking out--and he saw the
evening star. It must be hanging, he thought, just over the highest
branches of the black walnut tree at home, and he closed his eyes that
he might better conjure up the picture of that place.
</p><p>With day-to-day continuances the Commonwealth had strung out the
launching of his trial until the patience of the accused was worn
threadbare. How much longer this suspense would stretch itself he could
not guess.
</p><p>"I wonder what Dorothy's doin' right now," he murmured, and just then
Dorothy was listening to Bas Rowlett's most excellent opinion of
himself.
</p><p>It would not be long, the young woman was telling herself, before she
would go over there to the town east of the ridges--if only she could
suppress until that time came the furies that raged under her
masquerade and the aversion that wanted to cry out denunciation of her
tormentor!
</p><p>But the summons from the attorney had never come, and Bas never failed
to come as regularly as sunrise or sunset. His face was growing more and
more hateful to her with an unearthly and obsessing antipathy.
</p><p>One afternoon, when the last leaves had drifted down leaving the forests
stark and unfriendly, her heart ached with premonitions that she could
not soften with any philosophy at her command.
</p><p>Elviry Prooner had gone away when Bas arrived, and the strokes of Sim
Squires' axe sounded from a distant patch of woods, so she was alone
with her visitor.
</p><p>Bas planted his feet wide apart and stood with an offensive manner of
proprietorship on the hearth, toasting himself in the grateful warmth.
</p><p>"We've done got along right well tergether, little gal," he deigned to
announce. "An hit all only goes ter show how good things mout hev been
ef we hedn't nuver been hindered from weddin' at ther start."
</p><p>The insolent presumption of the creature sent the blood pounding through
Dorothy's temples and the room swum about her: a room sacred to clean
memories that were being defiled by his presence.
</p><p>"Ther time hain't ripe," she found herself making impetuous declaration,
"fer ye ter take no sich masterful tone, Bas. Matters hain't ended yet."
But here she caught herself up. Her anger had flashed into her tone and
it was not yet time to let it leap--so she laughed disarmingly as she
read the kindling of sullen anger in his eyes and added, "I don't allow
no man ter brag thet he overcome my will without no fight."
</p><p>Bas Rowlett roared out a laugh that dissipated his dangerously swelling
temper and nodded his head.
</p><p>"Thet's ther fashion ter talk, gal. I likes ter see a woman thet kin
toss her head like a fractious filly. I hain't got no manner of use fer
tame folks."
</p><p>He came close and stood devouring her with the passion of his lecherous
eyes, and Dorothy knew that her long effort to play a part had reached
its climax.
</p><p>He reached out his hands and for the second time he laid them upon her,
but now he did not seek to sweep her into an embrace. He merely let his
fingers rest, unsteady with hot feeling, on her shoulders as he said,
"Why kain't we quit foolin' along with each other, gal? <u>He</u> hain't
nuver comin' back ter ye no more."
</p><p>But at that Dorothy jerked herself away and her over-wrought control
snapped.
</p><p>"What does ye mean?" she demanded, breathlessly. A sudden fear possessed
her that fatal news had reached him before it had come to her. "Hes
anything happened ter him?"
</p><p>Instantly she realized what she had done, but it was useless to go on
acting after the self-betrayal of that moment's agitation, and even
Rowlett's self-complacent egotism read the whole truth of its meaning.
He read it and knew with a fullness of conviction that through the whole
episode she had been leading him on as a hunter decoys game and that her
slow and grudging conversion was no conversion at all.
</p><p>"Nothin' hain't happened ter him <u>yit</u>, so fur's I knows," he said,
slowly. "But ye doomed him ter death when ye flared up like thet, an'
proved ter me thet ye'd jest been lyin'."
</p><p>Dorothy gave back to the wall and one hand groped with outstretched
fingers against the smoothly squared logs, while the other ripped open
the buttons of her waist and closed on the knife hilt that was always
concealed there.
</p><p>Her voice came low and in a dead and monotonous level and her face was
ghost pale.
</p><p>"Yes, I lied ter ye ter keep ye from goin' over thar an' murderin' him.
I knowed ther way ye fights--I hain't nuver feared ye on my own account
but I <u>did</u> fear ye fer him ther same es a rattlesnake thet lays cyled
in ther grass."
</p><p>She paused and drew a resolute breath and her words were hardly louder
than a whisper.
</p><p>"Thar hain't no way on y'arth I wouldn't fight ter save him--even ef I
hed ter fight a Judas in Judas fashion. So I aimed ter keep ye hyar--an'
I kep' ye."
</p><p>"Ye've kep' me thus fur," he corrected her with his swarthy face as
malevolent as had ever been that of his red-skinned ancestors. "But ye
told ther truth awhile ago--an' ye told hit a mite too previous. Ther
matter hain't ended yit."
</p><p>"Yes, hit's es good es ended," she assured him with the death-like quiet
of a final resolve. "I made up my mind sometime back thet ye hed ter
die, Bas."
</p><p>Slowly the right hand came out of her loosened blouse and the firelight
flashed on the blade of the dirk so tightly held that the woman's
knuckles stood out white.
</p><p>"I'm goin' ter kill ye now, Bas," she said.
</p><p>For a few long moments they stood without other words, the woman holding
the dirk close to her side, and neither of them noted that for the past
ten minutes the sound of the axe had been silent off there in the woods.
</p><p>Then abruptly the door from the kitchen opened and Sim Squires stood
awkwardly on the threshold, with a face of wooden and vapid stupidity.
Apparently he had noted nothing unusual, yet he had looked through the
window before entering the house, and back of his unobservant seeming
lay the purpose of averting bloodshed.
</p><p>"I war jest lookin' fer ye, Bas," he said with the artlessness of
perfect art. "I hollered but ye didn't answer. I wisht ye'd come out an
holp me manpower a chunk up on ther choppin' block. I kain't heft hit by
myself."
</p><p>Bas scowled at the man whom he was supposed to dislike, but he followed
him readily enough out of the room, and when he had lifted the log, he
left the place without returning to the house.
</p><p>A half-hour later old Jase Burrell drew rein by the stile and handed
Dorothy a letter.
</p><p>"I reckon thet's ther one ye've been waitin' fer," he said, "so I
fetched hit over from ther post-office. What's ther matter, gal? Ye
looks like ye'd been seein' hants."
</p><p>"I hain't seed nothin' else fer days past," she declared, almost
hysterically. "I've done sickened with waitin', Uncle Jase, an' I aimed
ter start out soon termorrer mornin', letter or no letter."
