<p><em>WHEN M. </em>Mifroid recovered sufficiently from the shock
of his fall, the first thing that worried him was that he would
be "out of the game." Even at the moment of his fall his presence
of mind did not fail him, and he knew that he was falling into
one of the thousand-year-old quarries, which crossed under Paris
in their intricate meanderings. He experienced that feeling accompanied
by a light, painful torpor which follows a swoon caused by shock.</p>

<p>He was in the catacombs!</p>

<p>His first thought was to try and find the lights which he had
just bought, and so find out how the passage lay. He felt sure
that they must have fallen through the hole with him. The darkness
seemed to weigh heavily on his eyelids, and a great feeling of
depression came over him. Without getting up, for by an imprudent
movement he would lose the knowledge of the exact place where
he had fallen, he spread his hands about him and was relieved
to find his package again. He feared at first that the lamps would
be broken, but soon felt that it was not so; and breaking open
the package, he pressed the button on one of the lamps. The cavern
was lighted with a fairy brightness, and he could not keep from
smiling as he thought of the unfortunates who, shut up in some
cavern, generally drag themselves along, holding their breath,
behind a paltry snuff of a candle, which at any moment might flicker
out.</p>

<p>He got up then and examined the vault. He knew of the work of
repairing the track, and knew that they neared the end, but when
he saw that the hole through which he had fallen was closed, a
feeling akin to fear came over him.</p>

<p>Now some meters of earth separated him from the outside world,
unless it was possible for him to get up to this place which they
had filled in. He, however, flashed his light around, and after
surveying the walls and the vaults, he came across a prostrate
body. The sight at first gave him a shock, but on examination
he found it to be the body of M. Longuet—the body of the new Cartouche.
He examined it and noticed that it did not bear a single trace
of serious wounds. The man was stunned, as he had been himself,
and without doubt he would not be slow in coming out of that swoon.
He recalled that M. Lecamus had presented him to his friend in
the Champs Elysées, and behold, he was now mixed up with him like
the worst kind of assassins.</p>

<p>Just then M. Longuet breathed a sigh, stretched his arm, and
complained of some pains. He arose, and, saluting M. Mifroid,
asked him where they were. M. Mifroid told him. He did not seem
at all distressed, but drawing forth his portfolio, he traced
some lines which resembled a plan, and showed them to M. Mifroid,
saying:</p>

<p>"M. le Commissioner, we are at the bottom of the catacombs. It
is an extraordinary event. How we are going to get out I do not
know, but that which is distressing me most at the present moment
is what has happened to the express train." M. Mifroid demanded
some explanation, and M. Longuet related to him, with the closest
detail, the disappearance and re-appearance of the carriage and
the train. For the better understanding of the track he drew a
plan out as follows:</p>

<p>A H D C B</p>

<p>This he showed to M. Mifroid.</p>

<p>He explained how the train had disappeared between A and B. How
he had turned the switch at H and waited at D for the train to
pass on to the side track. He described how the train had never
come, and how the carriage had appeared and disappeared.</p>

<p>M. Mifroid became greatly interested, and begged him to repeat
the story. "And when did this happen?" asked he. "It has not yet
been reported to me."</p>

<p>"It happened several hours ago," said Théophraste, "and it should
have been reported by now."</p>

<p>M. Mifroid examined the plan for about five minutes, and after
reflecting for a while, asked Théophraste a few questions. Suddenly
he burst out laughing and said: "Why, what a difficult problem.
I have solved it in five minutes.</p>

<p>"You said there were five men at A and five men at B. It passes
through B, but not A. You were at D, and because you did not see,
it did not pass? Consequently, your train vanished. Well, I say
the train exists between A and B, and must be somewhere between
B and I, that is sure; the train is in the sandhill."</p>

<p>"I swear not!" said Théophraste. "I was at D expecting the train,
and I did not leave the track."</p>

<p>"It can be nowhere else, for five men saw it pass B and the five
men at A are equally certain it didn’t pass them. Therefore I
say that as only you were at D it passed that point, and undoubtedly
switched off on I, since it could not be otherwise. By a necessary
chance, while the first cars of the train were engulfed in the
sand hillock, which covered it up (imagine that the line H is
too short for the engineer to have had time to avoid the accident),
the yoke chain of the last car was broken, and so the last carriage
was forced by the baggage car to descend as far as D, on the track,
which was slightly up-grade, since it wrent into a sand hillock.
Then after going down to H and back to D, you saw the carriage
and Signor Petito in the doorway. Your Signor Petito opened the
carriage door, perhaps to throw himself out, as soon as he was
aware of the imminent catastrophe, and as the latter caused a
shock, it closed the door on the head of your Signor Petito.</p>

<p>"Now, having despoiled Signor Petito of his clothing, you walk
into the fields to read his papers. When you return the carriage
is no longer there. Now, then. Since there was a declivity, and
since there was a wind, the carriage, after having rolled as far
as H, is found on the line A—B, where the trainmen certainly have
found it by this time. Do you understand now? Do you understand
all except that you did not see the train pass D? You are deaf
sometimes, M. Longuet?"</p>

<p>"I have already had the honor of telling you so."</p>

<p>"Imagine that you were deaf while you were waiting for the train
at D. You did not hear then?"</p>

<p>"No, but I should have seen it."</p>

<p>"Already you did not hear it. That is much. Possibly you turned
your head for three seconds. Three seconds, that is to say, one
second and thirty hundredths longer than is necessary to see an
express train of four carriages pass before you, which, being
late, made 120 to the hour. M. Longuet, the train disappeared,
or, rather, seemed to disappear, because you were deaf and turned
your head for a brief space of time."</p>

<p>M. Longuet raised his arms to the limit toward the vaults of
the catacombs.</p>
