<p>CAPTAIN BILLY BYRNE rode out of the hills the following afternoon upon a
pinto pony that showed the whites of its eyes in a wicked rim about the
iris and kept its ears perpetually flattened backward.
</p>
<p>At the end of a lariat trailed the Brazos pony, for Billy, laughing
aside Bridge's pleas, was on his way to El Orobo Rancho to return the
stolen horse to its fair owner.
</p><p>At the moment of departure Pesita had asked Billy to ride by way of
Jose's to instruct the old Indian that he should bear word to one
Esteban that Pesita required his presence.
</p><p>It is a long ride from the retreat of the Pesitistas to Jose's squalid
hut, especially if one be leading an extra horse, and so it was that
darkness had fallen long before Billy arrived in sight of Jose's.
Dismounting some distance from the hut, Billy approached cautiously,
since the world is filled with dangers for those who are beyond the law,
and one may not be too careful.
</p><p>Billy could see a light showing through a small window, and toward
this he made his way. A short distance from Jose's is another, larger
structure from which the former inhabitants had fled the wrath of
Pesita. It was dark and apparently tenantless; but as a matter of fact a
pair of eyes chanced at the very moment of Billy's coming to be looking
out through the open doorway.
</p><p>The owner turned and spoke to someone behind him.
</p><p>“Jose has another visitor,” he said. “Possibly this one is less harmless
than the other. He comes with great caution. Let us investigate.”
</p><p>Three other men rose from their blankets upon the floor and joined the
speaker. They were all armed, and clothed in the nondescript uniforms of
Villistas. Billy's back was toward them as they sneaked from the hut in
which they were intending to spend the night and crept quietly toward
him.
</p><p>Billy was busily engaged in peering through the little window into
the interior of the old Indian's hovel. He saw an American in earnest
conversation with Jose. Who could the man be? Billy did not recognize
him; but presently Jose answered the question.
</p><p>“It shall be done as you wish, Senor Grayson,” he said.
</p><p>“Ah!” thought Billy; “the foreman of El Orobo. I wonder what business he
has with this old scoundrel--and at night.”
</p><p>What other thoughts Billy might have had upon the subject were rudely
interrupted by four energetic gentlemen in his rear, who leaped upon him
simultaneously and dragged him to the ground. Billy made no outcry; but
he fought none the less strenuously for his freedom, and he fought after
the manner of Grand Avenue, which is not a pretty, however effective,
way it may be.
</p><p>But four against one when all the advantages lie with the four are heavy
odds, and when Grayson and Jose ran out to investigate, and the ranch
foreman added his weight to that of the others Billy was finally
subdued. That each of his antagonists would carry mementos of the battle
for many days was slight compensation for the loss of liberty. However,
it was some.
</p><p>After disarming their captive and tying his hands at his back they
jerked him to his feet and examined him.
</p><p>“Who are you?” asked Grayson. “What you doin' sneakin' 'round spyin' on
me, eh?”
</p><p>“If you wanna know who I am, bo,” replied Billy, “go ask de Harlem
Hurricane, an' as fer spyin' on youse, I wasn't; but from de looks I
guess youse need spyin, yuh tinhorn.”
</p><p>A pony whinnied a short distance from the hut.
</p><p>“That must be his horse,” said one of the Villistas, and walked away to
investigate, returning shortly after with the pinto pony and Brazos.
</p><p>The moment Grayson saw the latter he gave an exclamation of
understanding.
</p><p>“I know him now,” he said. “You've made a good catch, Sergeant. This
is the fellow who robbed the bank at Cuivaca. I recognize him from the
descriptions I've had of him, and the fact that he's got the Brazos pony
makes it a cinch. Villa oughter promote you for this.”
</p><p>“Yep,” interjected Billy, “he orter make youse an admiral at least;
but youse ain't got me home yet, an' it'll take more'n four Dagos an' a
tin-horn to do it.”
</p><p>“They'll get you there all right, my friend,” Grayson assured him. “Now
come along.”
</p><p>They bundled Billy into his own saddle, and shortly after the little
party was winding southward along the river in the direction of El Orobo
Rancho, with the intention of putting up there for the balance of the
night where their prisoner could be properly secured and guarded. As
they rode away from the dilapidated hut of the Indian the old man stood
silhouetted against the rectangle of dim light which marked the open
doorway, and shook his fist at the back of the departing ranch foreman.
</p><p>“El cochino!” he cackled, and turned back into his hut.
</p><p>At El Orobo Rancho Barbara walked to and fro outside the ranchhouse.
Within her father sat reading beneath the rays of an oil lamp. From the
quarters of the men came the strains of guitar music, and an occasional
loud laugh indicated the climax of some of Eddie Shorter's famous Kansas
farmer stories.
</p><p>Barbara was upon the point of returning indoors when her attention was
attracted by the approach of a half-dozen horsemen. They reined into the
ranchyard and dismounted before the office building. Wondering a little
who came so late, Barbara entered the house, mentioning casually to her
father that which she had just seen.
</p><p>The ranch owner, now always fearful of attack, was upon the point
of investigating when Grayson rode up to the veranda and dismounted.
Barbara and her father were at the door as he ascended the steps.
</p><p>“Good news!” exclaimed the foreman. “I've got the bank robber, and
Brazos, too. Caught the sneakin' coyote up to--up the river a bit.” He
had almost said “Jose's;” but caught himself in time. “Someone's been
cuttin' the wire at the north side of the north pasture, an' I was
ridin' up to see ef I could catch 'em at it,” he explained.
</p><p>“He is an American?” asked the boss.
</p><p>“Looks like it; but he's got the heart of a greaser,” replied Grayson.
“Some of Villa's men are with me, and they're a-goin' to take him to
Cuivaca tomorrow.”
</p><p>Neither Barbara nor her father seemed to enthuse much. To them an
American was an American here in Mexico, where every hand was against
their race. That at home they might have looked with disgust upon this
same man did not alter their attitude here, that no American should take
sides against his own people. Barbara said as much to Grayson.
</p><p>“Why this fellow's one of Pesita's officers,” exclaimed Grayson. “He
don't deserve no sympathy from us nor from no other Americans. Pesita
has sworn to kill every American that falls into his hands, and this
fellow's with him to help him do it. He's a bad un.”
</p><p>“I can't help what he may do,” insisted Barbara. “He's an American, and
I for one would never be a party to his death at the hands of a Mexican,
and it will mean death to him to be taken to Cuivaca.”
</p><p>“Well, miss,” said Grayson, “you won't hev to be responsible--I'll take
all the responsibility there is and welcome. I just thought you'd like
to know we had him.” He was addressing his employer. The latter nodded,
and Grayson turned and left the room. Outside he cast a sneering laugh
back over his shoulder and swung into his saddle.
</p><p>In front of the men's quarters he drew rein again and shouted Eddie's
name. Shorter came to the door.
</p><p>“Get your six-shooter an' a rifle, an' come on over to the office. I
want to see you a minute.”
</p><p>Eddie did as he was bid, and when he entered the little room he saw four
Mexicans lolling about smoking cigarettes while Grayson stood before
a chair in which sat a man with his arms tied behind his back. Grayson
turned to Eddie.
</p><p>“This party here is the slick un that robbed the bank, and got away
on thet there Brazos pony thet miserable bookkeepin' dude giv him. The
sergeant here an' his men are a-goin' to take him to Cuivaca in the
mornin'. You stand guard over him 'til midnight, then they'll relieve
you. They gotta get a little sleep first, though, an' I gotta get
some supper. Don't stand fer no funny business now, Eddie,” Grayson
admonished him, and was on the point of leaving the office when a
thought occurred to him. “Say, Shorter,” he said, “they ain't no way
of gettin' out of the little bedroom in back there except through this
room. The windows are too small fer a big man to get through. I'll tell
you what, we'll lock him up in there an' then you won't hev to worry
none an' neither will we. You can jest spread out them Navajos there and
go to sleep right plump ag'in the door, an' there won't nobody hev to
relieve you all night.”
</p><p>“Sure,” said Eddie, “leave it to me--I'll watch the slicker.”
</p><p>Satisfied that their prisoner was safe for the night the Villistas and
Grayson departed, after seeing him safely locked in the back room.
</p><p>At the mention by the foreman of his guard's names--Eddie and
Shorter--Billy had studied the face of the young American cowpuncher,
for the two names had aroused within his memory a tantalizing suggestion
that they should be very familiar. Yet he could connect them in no way
with anyone he had known in the past and he was quite sure that he never
before had set eyes upon this man.
</p><p>Sitting in the dark with nothing to occupy him Billy let his mind dwell
upon the identity of his jailer, until, as may have happened to you,
nothing in the whole world seemed equally as important as the solution
of the mystery. Even his impending fate faded into nothingness by
comparison with the momentous question as to where he had heard the name
Eddie Shorter before.
</p><p>As he sat puzzling his brain over the inconsequential matter something
stirred upon the floor close to his feet, and presently he jerked back a
booted foot that a rat had commenced to gnaw upon.
</p><p>“Helluva place to stick a guy,” mused Billy, “in wit a bunch o'
man-eatin' rats. Hey!” and he turned his face toward the door. “You,
Eddie! Come here!”
</p><p>Eddie approached the door and listened.
</p><p>“Wot do you want?” he asked. “None o' your funny business, you know. I'm
from Shawnee, Kansas, I am, an' they don't come no slicker from nowhere
on earth. You can't fool me.”
</p><p>Shawnee, Kansas! Eddie Shorter! The whole puzzle was cleared in Billy's
mind in an instant.
</p><p>“So you're Eddie Shorter of Shawnee, Kansas, are you?” called Billy.
“Well I know your maw, Eddie, an' ef I had such a maw as you got I
wouldn't be down here wastin' my time workin' alongside a lot of Dagos;
but that ain't what I started out to say, which was that I want a
light in here. The damned rats are tryin' to chaw off me kicks an' when
they're done wit them they'll climb up after me an' old man Villa'll be
sore as a pup.”
</p><p>“You know my maw?” asked Eddie, and there was a wistful note in his
voice. “Aw shucks! you don't know her--that's jest some o' your funny,
slicker business. You wanna git me in there an' then you'll try an'
git aroun' me some sort o' way to let you escape; but I'm too slick for
that.”
</p><p>“On the level Eddie, I know your maw,” persisted Billy. “I ben in your
maw's house jest a few weeks ago. 'Member the horsehair sofa between the
windows? 'Member the Bible on the little marble-topped table? Eh? An'
Tige? Well, Tige's croaked; but your maw an' your paw ain't an' they
want you back, Eddie. I don't care ef you believe me, son, or not; but
your maw was mighty good to me, an' you promise me you'll write her an'
then go back home as fast as you can. It ain't everybody's got a swell
maw like that, an' them as has ought to be good to 'em.”
</p><p>Beyond the closed door Eddie's jaw was commencing to tremble. Memory
was flooding his heart and his eyes with sweet recollections of an ample
breast where he used to pillow his head, of a big capable hand that was
wont to smooth his brow and stroke back his red hair. Eddie gulped.
</p><p>“You ain't joshin' me?” he asked. Billy Byrne caught the tremor in the
voice.
</p><p>“I ain't kiddin' you son,” he said. “Wotinell do you take me fer--one o'
these greasy Dagos? You an' I're Americans--I wouldn't string a home guy
down here in this here Godforsaken neck o' the woods.”
</p><p>Billy heard the lock turn, and a moment later the door was cautiously
opened revealing Eddie safely ensconced behind two six-shooters.
</p><p>“That's right, Eddie,” said Billy, with a laugh. “Don't you take no
chances, no matter how much sob stuff I hand you, fer, I'll give it to
you straight, ef I get the chanct I'll make my get-away; but I can't do
it wit my flippers trussed, an' you wit a brace of gats sittin' on me.
Let's have a light, Eddie. That won't do nobody any harm, an' it may
discourage the rats.”
</p><p>Eddie backed across the office to a table where stood a small lamp.
Keeping an eye through the door on his prisoner he lighted the lamp and
carried it into the back room, setting it upon a commode which stood in
one corner.
</p><p>“You really seen maw?” he asked. “Is she well?”
</p><p>“Looked well when I seen her,” said Billy; “but she wants her boy back
a whole lot. I guess she'd look better still ef he walked in on her some
day.”
</p><p>“I'll do it,” cried Eddie. “The minute they get money for the pay I'll
hike. Tell me your name. I'll ask her ef she remembers you when I get
home. Gee! but I wish I was walkin' in the front door now.”
</p><p>“She never knew my name,” said Billy; “but you tell her you seen the bo
that mussed up the two yeggmen who rolled her an' were tryin' to croak
her wit a butcher knife. I guess she ain't fergot. Me an' my pal were
beatin' it--he was on the square but the dicks was after me an' she let
us have money to make our get-away. She's all right, kid.”
</p><p>There came a knock at the outer office door. Eddie sprang back into
the front room, closing and locking the door after him, just as Barbara
entered.
</p><p>“Eddie,” she asked, “may I see the prisoner? I want to talk to him.”
</p><p>“You want to talk with a bank robber?” exclaimed Eddie. “Why you ain't
crazy are you, Miss Barbara?”
</p><p>“No, I'm not crazy; but I want to speak with him alone for just a
moment, Eddie--please.”
</p><p>Eddie hesitated. He knew that Grayson would be angry if he let the
boss's daughter into that back room alone with an outlaw and a robber,
and the boss himself would probably be inclined to have Eddie drawn and
quartered; but it was hard to refuse Miss Barbara anything.
</p><p>“Where is he?” she asked.
</p><p>Eddie jerked a thumb in the direction of the door. The key still was in
the lock.
</p><p>“Go to the window and look at the moon, Eddie,” suggested the girl.
“It's perfectly gorgeous tonight. Please, Eddie,” as he still hesitated.
</p><p>Eddie shook his head and moved slowly toward the window.
</p><p>“There can't nobody refuse you nothin', miss,” he said; “'specially when
you got your heart set on it.”
</p><p>“That's a dear, Eddie,” purred the girl, and moved swiftly across the
room to the locked door.
</p><p>As she turned the key in the lock she felt a little shiver of nervous
excitement run through her. “What sort of man would he be--this hardened
outlaw and robber--this renegade American who had cast his lot with the
avowed enemies of his own people?” she wondered.
</p><p>Only her desire to learn of Bridge's fate urged her to attempt so
distasteful an interview; but she dared not ask another to put
the question for her, since should her complicity in Bridge's
escape--provided of course that he had escaped--become known to Villa
the fate of the Americans at El Orobo would be definitely sealed.
</p><p>She turned the knob and pushed the door open, slowly. A man was sitting
in a chair in the center of the room. His back was toward her. He was a
big man. His broad shoulders loomed immense above the back of the rude
chair. A shock of black hair, rumpled and tousled, covered a well-shaped
head.
</p><p>At the sound of the door creaking upon its hinges he turned his face in
her direction, and as his eyes met hers all four went wide in surprise
and incredulity.
</p><p>“Billy!” she cried.
</p><p>“Barbara!--you?” and Billy rose to his feet, his bound hands struggling
to be free.
</p><p>The girl closed the door behind her and crossed to him.
</p><p>“You robbed the bank, Billy?” she asked. “It was you, after the promises
you made me to live straight always--for my sake?” Her voice trembled
with emotion. The man could see that she suffered, and yet he felt his
own anguish, too.
</p><p>“But you are married,” he said. “I saw it in the papers. What do you
care, now, Barbara? I'm nothing to you.”
</p><p>“I'm not married, Billy,” she cried. “I couldn't marry Mr. Mallory. I
tried to make myself believe that I could; but at last I knew that I did
not love him and never could, and I wouldn't marry a man I didn't love.
</p><p>“I never dreamed that it was you here, Billy,” she went on. “I came to
ask you about Mr. Bridge. I wanted to know if he escaped, or if--if--oh,
this awful country! They think no more of human life here than a butcher
thinks of the life of the animal he dresses.”
</p><p>A sudden light illumined Billy's mind. Why had it not occurred to him
before? This was Bridge's Penelope! The woman he loved was loved by his
best friend. And she had sent a messenger to him, to Billy, to save her
lover. She had come here to the office tonight to question a stranger--a
man she thought an outlaw and a robber--because she could not rest
without word from the man she loved. Billy stiffened. He was hurt to the
bottom of his heart; but he did not blame Bridge--it was fate. Nor did
he blame Barbara because she loved Bridge. Bridge was more her kind
anyway. He was a college guy. Billy was only a mucker.
</p><p>“Bridge got away all right,” he said. “And say, he didn't have nothin'
to do with pullin' off that safe crackin'. I done it myself. He didn't
know I was in town an' I didn't know he was there. He's the squarest guy
in the world, Bridge is. He follered me that night an' took a shot at
me, thinkin' I was the robber all right but not knowin' I was me. He
got my horse, an' when he found it was me, he made me take your pony an'
make my get-away, fer he knew Villa's men would croak me sure if they
caught me. You can't blame him fer that, can you? Him an' I were good
pals--he couldn't do nothin' else. It was him that made me bring your
pony back to you. It's in the corral now, I reckon. I was a-bringin' it
back when they got me. Now you better go. This ain't no place fer you,
an' I ain't had no sleep fer so long I'm most dead.” His tones were
cool. He appeared bored by her company; though as a matter of fact
his heart was breaking with love for her--love that he believed
unrequited--and he yearned to tear loose his bonds and crush her in his
arms.
</p><p>It was Barbara's turn now to be hurt. She drew herself up.
</p><p>“I am sorry that I have disturbed your rest,” she said, and walked away,
her head in the air; but all the way back to the ranchhouse she kept
repeating over and over to herself: “Tomorrow they will shoot him!
Tomorrow they will shoot him! Tomorrow they will shoot him!”
