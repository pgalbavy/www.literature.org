<p>He hesitated, poised on the threshold, his yellow eyes contracting,
dazzled by the candle; then, like lightning, his sword glittered
in his hand, but Mount, behind him, tore the limber blade from
his grip and flung it ringing at my feet. Now, weaponless and
alone, Butler stood confronting us, his blank eyes travelling
from one to another, his thin lips twitching in an ever-deepening
sneer. Nor did the sneer leave his face when Mount slammed and
locked the door behind him, and unsheathed his broad hunting-knife.</p>

<p>"Something is dreadfully wrong, gentlemen," quavered poor Cade
Renard; "this is Captain Butler, my daughter's affianced. I pray
you follow no ancient quarrel under my roof, gentlemen. I cannot
suffer this affront &mdash;I cannot permit this difference between
gentlemen in my daughter's presence&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mount quietly drew the little man aside to the door and led him
out, saying tenderly: "All is well, old friend; you have forgotten
much in these long days. You will remember soon. Go, dream in
the moonlight, Cade. She was ever a friend to us, the moon."</p>

<p>Suddenly Butler turned on Silver Heels, his darkening face distorted.</p>

<p>"You have played the game well!" he whispered, between his teeth.</p>

<p>"What game?" I asked, with deadly calmness. "Pray say what you
have to say at once, Mr. Butler."</p>

<p>Again his evil gaze shifted from face to face; there was no mercy
in the eyes that met his; his visage grew loose and pallid.</p>

<p>"That she-devil swore to wed me!" he broke out, hoarsely, pointing
a shaking finger full at Silver Heels. "She&mdash;swore it!" His voice
sank to a hiss.</p>

<p>"To save my father from a highwayman's death!" said Silver Heels,
deathly white.</p>

<p>She turned to me, quivering. "Michael, I am a thief's daughter.
This is what I am come to!&mdash;to buy my father's life with my own
body&mdash;and fling my soul at that man's feet! <em>Now will you wed
me?</em>"</p>

<p>A cold fury blinded me so I could scarcely see him. I cocked
my rifle and drew my hand across my eyes to clear them.</p>

<p>"This is not your quarrel!" he said, desperately; "this woman
is the daughter of Cade Renard, a notorious highwayman known as
the Weasel! I doubt that Sir Michael Cardigan&mdash;for your uncle
is dead, whether you know it or not!&mdash;would care to claim kinship
in this house!"</p>

<p>He turned like a snake and measured Mount from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Give me my sword!" he said, harshly, "and I will answer for
myself against this other thief!" His glaring eyes fell on Foxcroft.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you doing here?" he snarled. "Are you knave
or fool, that you stand there listening to this threat on my life?
You know that this woman is Renard's child! You have Sir John's
papers to prove it! Are you not his attorney, man? Then tell these
gentlemen that I speak the truth, and that I will meet them both,
singly, and carve it on their bodies lest they forget it!"</p>

<p>"It is too late," I said; "a gentleman's sword can never again
be soiled by those hands."</p>

<p>"Ay!" cried Foxcroft, suddenly, "it is too late! You say I have
papers to prove the truth? I have; and you shall hear the truth,
you cursed scoundrel!"</p>

<p>"She is the Weasel's child!" cried Butler, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"If she were the child of Tom o' Bedlam, she is still betrothed
to me! God knows," I said, "whether you be human or demon, and
so perhaps you may not burn in hell, but I shall send you thither,
with God's help!"</p>

<p>And I laid my hand on his arm, and asked him if he was minded
to die quietly in the garden; while Mount, knife at his throat,
pushed him towards the door.</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?" he burst out, shuddering. "Am I not to have
a chance for life? This is murder, Mr. Cardigan!"</p>

<p>"So dealt you by me at the Cayuga stake," I said.</p>

<p>"Yet&mdash;it is murder you do. If my hands are not clean, would you
foul your own?"</p>

<p>"So dealt you by me in Queen Street prison," I said, slowly.</p>

<p>"Yet, nevertheless, it is murder. And you know it. This is no
court of law, to sit in judgment. Are the Cardigans the public
hangmen?"</p>

<p>"Give him his sword!" I cried, passionately. "I cannot breathe
while he draws breath! Give him his sword, or I will slay him
with naked hands!"</p>

<p>"No!" roared Foxcroft, hurling me back.</p>

<p>Butler scowled at the lawyer; Foxcroft scowled at him, and placed
his heavy shoe on the fallen sword. Then he suddenly stooped,
seized the gilded hilt, and snapped the blade in two, casting
the fragments from him in contempt.</p>

<p>"The sword of a scoundrel," he said; "the sword of a petty malefactor&mdash;a
pitiful forger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Liar!" shrieked Butler, springing at him. Mount flung the maddened
man into a chair, where he lay, white and panting, staring at
Foxcroft, who now stood by the table, coolly examining a packet
of documents.</p>

<p>"It is all here," he said&mdash;"the story of two cheap dabblers in
petty crime &mdash;Sir John Johnson and Mr. Walter Butler&mdash;how
they did conspire to steal from Miss Warren her wealth, her fair
fame, and the very name God gave her. A shameful story, gentlemen,
but true on the word of an honourable man."</p>

<p>"Lies!" muttered Butler, between ashen lips. His cheeks became
loose and horrible; his lips shrivelled up above his teeth. Foxcroft
turned to me, purple with passion.</p>

<p>"Sir William Johnson, your honourable kinsman, left Miss Warren
property in his will. Sir John found, in the same box which held
the will, a packet of documents and letters addressed to Sir William,
apparently proving that Miss Warren was the child of a certain
lady who had left her husband to follow the fortunes of Captain
Warren&mdash;her child by her own husband, Cade Renard, a gentleman
of Cambridge."</p>

<p>"The Weasel!" burst out Jack Mount.</p>

<p>"But she is not, sir!" cried Foxcroft, turning on Mount. "She
is Captain Warren's own child; I journeyed to England and proved
it; I have papers here in my pocket to prove it!" he said, slapping
the flaps of his brass-buttoned coat. "It was a lie from beginning
to end; the letters supposed to have been written to Sir William
by Sir Peter Warren were forged; the documents supposed to have
been unearthed from the flooring in the captain's cabin of his
Majesty's ship <em>Leda</em> were forged. I can prove it! I can
prove that Walter Butler was the forger! I can prove that Sir
John Johnson knew it! And to that end Sir John and Captain Butler
conspired to make her believe herself to be the child of a half-crazed
forest-runner who had been besetting Sir John with his mad importunities,
calling himself Cade Renard, and vowing that Miss Warren was his
own child!"</p>

<p>He glared at Butler; the wretched man's lips moved to form the
word, "Lies!" but no sound came. Then Foxcroft turned to me.</p>

<p>"In my presence these three men broke the news to her; they hoodwinked
me, too. By God, sir, I had never suspected villany had not that
contemptible fool, Sir John, attempted to bribe silence, should
anything ever occur to cast doubt on the relationship betwixt
this fellow Renard and Miss Warren!"</p>

<p>The lawyer paused, grinding his teeth in rage.</p>

<p>"I accepted the bribe! I did, gentlemen! I did it to quiet suspicion.
Sir John believes me to be his creature. But I set out to follow
the matter to the bitter end, and I have done it! It's a falsehood
from A to Zed! I shall have the pleasure of flinging Sir John's
bribe into his face!"</p>

<p>He laid his hand on my arm, speaking very gently and gravely.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cardigan, Miss Warren is the truest, bravest, sweetest woman
I have ever known. She received the news of her dreadful position
as a gallant soldier receives the fire of the enemy. When it was
made hopelessly clear to her that this lunatic Renard was her
father, and that she was not a Warren, not an heiress, that she
must now give up all thought of the family on which she had so
long imposed&mdash;and give up all pretensions to <em>you</em>, sir&mdash;she
acquiesced with a dignity that might have become a princess of
the blood, sir! No whining there, Mr. Cardigan! Not a whimper,
sir; not a reproach, not a tear. Her first thought was of pity
for her father&mdash;this little, withered lunatic, who sat there devouring
her with his eyes of a sick hound. She went to him before us all;
she took his hand&mdash;his hard, little claw&mdash;and kissed it. By God,
gentlemen, blood tells!"</p>

<p>After a long silence I repeated, "Blood tells."</p>

<p>Mount, head in his hands, was weeping.</p>

<p>"Then came Butler, the forger," said Foxcroft, pointing at him.
"And when he found that, after all, Miss Warren honoured herself
too highly to seek a rehabilitation through his name, he came
here and threatened this poor old man's life&mdash;threatened to denounce
him as a thief, and have him hung at a cross-roads, unless she
gave herself to him! Then&mdash;then she consented."</p>

<p>Butler was sitting forward in his chair, his bloodless face supported
between his slim fingers, his eyes on vacancy. He did not seem
to hear the words that branded him; he did not appear to see us
as we drew closer around him.</p>

<p>"In the orchard," muttered Mount; "we can hang him with his own
bridle."</p>

<p>We paused for an instant, gazing silently at the doomed man.
Then Mount touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>At the voiceless summons he looked up at us as though stunned.</p>

<p>"You must hang," said Mount, gravely.</p>

<p>"Not that! No!" I stammered; "I can't do it! Give him a sword&mdash;give
him something to fight with! Jack &mdash;I can't do it. I am not
made that way!"</p>

<p>There was a touch on my arm; Silver Heels stood beside me.</p>

<p>"Let them deal with him," she murmured, "you cannot fight with
him; there is no honour in him."</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;no honour in him!" I repeated.</p>

<p>He had risen, and now stood, staring vacantly at me.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" cried Mount, "are you going to let him loose on
the world again?"</p>

<p>"I cannot slay him," I said.</p>

<p>"But a rope can!" said Mount.</p>

<p>"Do you then draw it," I replied, "and never rail more at the
hangman!"</p>

<p>After a moment I unlocked and opened the door. As in a trance,
Butler passed out into the moonlight; Mount stole close behind
him, and I saw his broad knife glimmer as he followed.</p>

<p>"Let him go," I said, wearily. "I choke with all this foul intrigue.
Is there no work to do, Jack, save the sheriff's? Faugh! Let him
go!"</p>

<p>Butler slowly set foot to stirrup; Mount snatched the pistol
from the saddle-holster with a savage sneer.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said. "Trust a scoundrel if you will, lad, but draw
his fangs first. Oh, Lord above!&mdash;but I hate to let him go! Shall
I? I'll give him a hundred yards before I fire! And I'll not aim
at that! Shall I?"</p>

<p>If Butler heard him he made no sign. He turned in his saddle
and looked at Silver Heels.</p>

<p>Should I let him loose on the world once more? God knows I am
no prophet, nor pretend to see behind the veil; yet, as I stood
there, looking on Walter Butler, I thought the haze that the moon
spun in the garden grew red like that fearsome light which tinges
the smoke of burning houses, and I remembered that dream I had
of him, so long ago, when I saw him in the forest, with blood
on him, and fresh scalps at his belt&mdash;and the scalps were not
of the red men.</p>

<p>Should I, who had him in my power, and could now forever render
the demon in him powerless&mdash;should I let him go free into the
world, or send him forever to the dreadful abode of lost souls?</p>

<p>War was at hand. War would come at dawn when the Grenadiers marched
into Concord town. To slay him, then, would be no murder. But
now?</p>

<p>Mount, watching me steadily, raised his rifle.</p>

<p>"No," I said.</p>

<p>What was I to do? There was no prison to hale him to; the jails
o' Boston lodged no Tories. Justice? There was no justice save
that mockery at Province House. Law? Gage was the law &mdash;Gage,
the friend of this man. What was I to do? Once again Mount raised
his rifle.</p>

<p>"No," I said.</p>

<p>So passed Walter Butler from among us, riding slowly out into
the shadowy world, under the calm moon. God witness that I conducted
as my honour urged, not as my hot blood desired&mdash;and He shall
deal with me one day, face to face, that I let loose this man
on the world, yet did not dream of the hell he should make of
Tryon County ere his red soul was fled again to the hell that
hatched it!</p>

<p>So rode forth mine enemy, Walter Butler, invulnerable for me
in his armour of dishonour, unpunished for the woe that he had
wrought, unmarked by justice which the dawn had not yet roused
from her long sleep in chains.</p>

<p>Again Mount raised his rifle.</p>

<p>"No," I said.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>A little breeze began stirring in the moonlit orchard; our horses
tossed their heads and stamped; then silence fell.</p>

<p>After a long while the voice of Mount recalled me to myself;
he had drawn poor Renard to a seat on the rotting steps of the
porch.</p>

<p>"Now do you know me, Cade?" asked Mount, again and again.</p>

<p>The Weasel folded his withered hands in his lap and looked up,
solemnly.</p>

<p>"Cade? Cade, old friend?" persisted Mount, piteously, drawing
his great arm about the Weasel's stooping shoulders.</p>

<p>The Weasel's solemn eyes met his in silence.</p>

<p>Mount forced a cheerful laugh that rang false in the darkness.</p>

<p>"What! Forget the highway, Cade? The King's highway, old friend?
The moon at the cross-roads? Eh? You remember? Say you remember,
Cade."</p>

<p>The blank eyes of the Weasel were fixed on Mount.</p>

<p>"The forest? Eh, Cade? Ho!&mdash;lad! The rank smell o' the moss,
and the stench of rotting logs? The quiet in the woods, the hermit-bird
piping in the pines? Say you remember, old friend!" he begged;
"tell me you remember! Ho! lad, have you forgot the tune the war-arrow
sings?"</p>

<p>And he made a long-drawn, whispering whimper with his lips.</p>

<p>In pantomime he crouched and pointed; the Weasel's mild eyes
turned.</p>

<p>"The Iroquois!" whispered Mount, anxiously. "They wear O-Kwen-cha!&mdash;red
paint! Hark to the war-drums! Do you not hear them chanting:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Ha-wa-sa-say!<br/>
Ha-wa-sa-say!"

</p>
</div>
<p>The Weasel's eyes grew troubled; he looked up at Mount trustfully,
like a child who refuses to be frightened.</p>

<p>"I hear Che-ten-ha, the mouse; he gnaws, gnaws, gnaws."</p>

<p>"No, it is the Iroquois!" urged Mount. "You have fought them,
Cade; you remember? Say that you remember!"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I have fought the Iroquois," repeated the Weasel, passing
his hand over his brow; "but it was years ago&mdash;years ago&mdash;too
long ago to remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Mount, "it was but yesterday, old friend&mdash;yesterday!
And who went with you on the burnt trail, Cade? Who went with
you by night and by day, by starlight and by sun, eating when
you ate, starving when you starved, drinking deep when you drank,
thirsting when you thirsted? It was I, Cade!" cried Mount, eagerly;
"I!"</p>

<p>"It was Tah-hoon-to-whe, the night-hawk," murmured the little
man.</p>

<p>"It was I, Jack Mount!" repeated the forest-runner, in a loud
voice. "Hark! The Iroquois drums! The game's afoot, Cade! Rouse
up, old friend! The trail is free!"</p>

<p>But the Weasel only stared at him with his solemn, aged eyes,
and clasped his trembling hands in his lap.</p>

<p>Mount stood still for a long while. Slowly his eager head sank,
his arms fell, hopelessly. Then, with a gulping sob, he sank down
beside his ancient comrade, and hid his head in his huge hands.</p>

<p>The Weasel looked at him with sorrowful eyes; then rose, and
came slowly towards Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"They say you are not my daughter," he said, taking Silver Heels's
hands from mine. "They tell me I have forgotten many things&mdash;that
you are not my little girl. But&mdash;we know better, my child."</p>

<p>He bent and kissed her hands. His hair was white as frost.</p>

<p>"We know better, child," he murmured. "You shall tell me all
they say&mdash;for I cannot understand&mdash;and we will smile to remember
it all, in the long summer evenings&mdash;will we not, my child?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Silver Heels, faintly.</p>

<p>"There is much, sir, that I forget in these days," he said, turning
gravely towards me&mdash;"much that I cannot recall. Age comes to us
all with God's mercy, sir. Pray you forgive if I lack in aught
of courtesy to my guests. There are many people who stay with
us&mdash;and I cannot remember all names of new and welcome guests&mdash;believe
me, most welcome. I think your name is Captain Butler?"</p>

<p>"Sir Michael Cardigan," whispered Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"And welcome, always welcome to us here in Cambridge Hall," murmured
the old man, staring vacantly about him.</p>

<p>Foxcroft, who had gone to the shabby barn, came back and whispered
that there were no horses there, and no vehicle of any description;
that we had best make ready for a journey to Albany immediately,
and abandon the house and its scant furnishings to the mercy of
chance.</p>

<p>I left it to him and to Jack Mount to persuade poor Renard that
a journey was necessary that very night; and to them also I left
the care of providing for us as best they might, saying that I
had no money until I could reach Albany, and that my horse Warlock
was to carry Miss Warren.</p>

<p>When Mount had drawn poor Cade away, and when Foxcroft began
rummaging the great house for what necessaries and provisions
it might contain, Silver Heels took me by the hand and led me
up the creaking old stairs and across the gallery to her own chamber.
The moonlight flooded the room as we entered, making its every
corner sparkle.</p>

<p>Save for the great four-posted bed with its heavy canopy, there
was in the room nothing but a pine table and a jug and basin.</p>

<p>"So poor am I," she whispered, close beside my face.</p>

<p>"Is this all?" I asked.</p>

<p>"All save the clothes on my body, Michael."</p>

<p>"Silver Heels! Silver Heels!" I said, sorrowfully, holding her
by the hands and never moving my eyes from her tender eyes. And
we looked and looked, nor gazed our fill, and the light of her
sweet presence was like moonlight which swam in the silvery room,
bathing me to the soul of me with deep content.</p>

<p>"All these piteous days!" she said, slowly.</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;all of them! And each hour a year, and each nightfall a
closing century. Silver Heels! Silver Heels! You are unchanged,
dear heart!"</p>

<p>"Thin to my bones, and very, very old&mdash;like you, Michael."</p>

<p>"We have young souls."</p>

<p>"Yes, Michael. We are young in all save sorrow."</p>

<p>"And you are so tall, Silver Heels&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Span my waist!"</p>

<p>"My hand would span it. Ah! Your head comes not above my chin
for all your willow growth!"</p>

<p>"Your hands are rough, Sir Michael."</p>

<p>"Your hands are satin, sweet."</p>

<p>"Yet I wash my kerchief and my shifts in suds."</p>

<p>How the moon glowed and glowed on her.</p>

<p>"You grow in beauty, Silver Heels," I said.</p>

<p>"When you are with me I do truly feel beauty growing in me, Michael."</p>

<p>We sat down together on the great bed's edge, her face against
mine, and looked out at the faint stars which the glory of the
moon had not yet drowned in light.</p>

<p>Far in the night a cock crowed in the false dawn.</p>

<p>"You have suffered, sweet?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"Ay. And you?"</p>

<p>"Much," I replied.</p>

<p>After a long while she spoke.</p>

<p>"You have never wavered&mdash;not once&mdash;not for one moment?"</p>

<p>"Once."</p>

<p>In a faint whisper, "When?"</p>

<p>"On the road from Albany, dear heart."</p>

<p>"You rode in company?"</p>

<p>"Not of my choice."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Do not ask."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"In honour."</p>

<p>"You wavered?"</p>

<p>"There was no danger when I thought of you."</p>

<p>She raised her face; her mouth touched mine, then clung to it,
and I breathed the sweetest breath a maid e'er drew, and all my
soul grew dim and warm and faint, with her arms now around my
neck, now clinging to my shoulders, and her face like a blossom
crushed to mine.</p>

<p>Trembling in limb and body she stood up, brushing her gray eyes
awake with slender fingers.</p>

<p>"Ah, what happiness, what happiness!" she whispered. "I am all
a-quiver, and I burn to the soul of me. What strange, sweet mischief
is there in your lips, Michael? Nay&mdash;do not touch me&mdash;dear, dear
lad; not now&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>She leaned from the open casement; in the intense stillness a
voice broke out from below:</p>

<p>"Ready, Cardigan! The horses wait at the barn!"</p>

<p>As she had no cloak I wrapped her in mine, and, passing my arm
around her, led her down to the porch and out across the orchard
to the barn where Renard sat, mounted on his old comrade's horse.</p>

<p>Warlock came to my call; he nosed the little hand that Silver
Heels held out, and laid his head close to hers.</p>

<p>"Bear her safely, Warlock!" I muttered, huskily, and lifted her
to the saddle, bidding Foxcroft mount his own horse, as I would
walk beside Miss Warren.</p>

<p>So we started, Foxcroft in the van, then the Weasel, with Mount
afoot, leading the horse, then Silver Heels in her saddle, with
one hand on my shoulder as I walked at her side, rifle trailed.</p>

<p>"There is a road which swings north," said Foxcroft. "We must
circle Lexington."</p>

<p>"There is a road yonder," called out Mount.</p>

<p>Foxcroft hesitated.</p>

<p>"I think it leads to Roxbury," he said; "I cannot tell if it
be the road."</p>

<p>"Is it the Roxbury Road, Cade?" asked Mount, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Doubtless, doubtless," replied the Weasel, vacantly, staring
at Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"He does not remember," whispered Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"Try it," said Mount; "I doubt not but that it swings far north
o' Lexington. If this were the forest 'twixt Saint Sacrement and
Pitt I'd vouch for us all, but the smell o' the town has dulled
and blunted my nose, and I see no longer like a tabby in a dark
pantry."</p>

<p>He moved into the road, following Foxcroft, and leading the horse
on which Cade Renard was mounted. I came last with Silver Heels.</p>

<p>The moon was well on her journey towards the dark world's edge
ere we came to a cross-roads; but the four finger-posts were missing,
and we found ourselves no wiser than before. Foxcroft voiced his
misgivings that we were on the Lexington Road after all, and not
on the road to Roxbury, as we should surely have crossed the Concord
Road ere this.</p>

<p>And he was right, for in a few moments we came in full view of
the Lexington Meeting-house, with the Concord Road running into
our road on the left and "Buckman's Tavern" on the right, all
ablaze with candles set in every window, and a great stable lanthorn
shining in the centre of the road.</p>

<p>"It is past three in the morning," said Foxcroft, looking at
his watch. "The British should have been here ere this if they
were coming at all."</p>

<p>Mount threw his rifle into the hollow of his left arm, and, tossing
his horse's bridle to Foxcroft, walked towards "Buckman's Tavern"
where, in the lanthorn light, a throng of men were standing.</p>

<p>I heard him greet them with a hearty "God save our country";
then he disappeared in the crowd.</p>

<p>The night had turned chilly; I buttoned my riding-coat across
Silver Heels's throat and covered her head with the cape, tying
it under her chin like a hood.</p>

<p>Presently Mount came striding back, rifle on shoulder, followed
by an hostler with a stable light.</p>

<p>"The militia have been yonder under arms since midnight," he
said. "A messenger rode in ten minutes since with news that the
road was clear and no British coming. We can get a post-chaise
here"&mdash;he nodded towards the hostler who stood swinging his lamp
in one hand and his firelock in t'other.</p>

<p>"I guess the redcoats ain't a-coming, gentlemen," said the hostler,
with a grin.</p>

<p>"Then we had best bait at the tavern," said Foxcroft, quickly;
and he led the way, riding beside the Weasel, who seemed utterly
indifferent to his surroundings.</p>

<p>As we threaded our path through the crowd of men and boys I noticed
that all were armed with rifles or old-time firelocks, and some
even with ancient blunderbusses and bell-muzzled matchlocks. They
appeared to be a respectable company, mostly honest yokels from
the village, clad in plain homespun. A few wore the militia uniform;
one or two officers were dressed in the full uniform of the Third
Suffolk Regiment. They eyed us curiously as we passed through
their straggling ranks; one called out: "The forest-runners are
with us! Hurrah!" But, for the most part, they regarded us quietly,
readily making way for me as I came up, leading Warlock with Silver
Heels in the saddle, cloaked to the eyes.</p>

<p>A servant, wearing a pistol in his belt, brought us bread and
hot stirabout in a great blue bowl. This dry fare we washed with
ale, Silver Heels tasting a glass of Madeira to warm her chilled
body.</p>

<p>It was a silent, thoughtful repast. Mount, sitting close beside
the Weasel, urged the old man to eat, and he did, mechanically,
with dazed eyes fixed on space.</p>

<p>One thing I began to notice: he no longer watched Silver Heels
with that humble, devoted, hungering mien of a guardian hound;
he scarcely appeared to be aware of her presence at all. Once
only he spoke, asking what had become of his rifle; and Mount,
eager and hopeful, brought his own rifle to the stricken man.
But the Weasel had already forgotten what he had asked for, and
he glanced at the weapon listlessly, his hands folded before him
on the cloth.</p>

<p>Though her life had nigh been wrecked forever by this poor madman,
Silver Heels, sitting at his elbow, watched over him with a serious
tenderness and pity, doing for him those little offices which
do become the children of the aged and infirm, and which, God
grant, our children shall fulfil towards us. And so I saw her
with the salt-box, savouring his stirabout so that it should be
seasoned to his liking, and, with the cone of sugar, chip such
morsels with her knife as he might mumble when he chose.</p>

<p>Presently Foxcroft went to the stables to see that our post-chaise
was well provisioned for the journey, and Mount led Renard away
to watch the feed-bags filled for our horses' provender.</p>

<p>Silver Heels, still wrapped in my riding-cloak, laid her slim
hand on my arm, and we walked together to the tavern porch.</p>

<p>The road from Boston divides in front of the Meeting-house, forming
two sides of a grassy triangle, on the base of which stands the
Meeting-house, facing down the Boston Road. Near this village
green a few armed men still lingered in the faint light of dawn,
conversing in low voices, and glancing often down the deserted
Boston Road.</p>

<p>A score of men sat around us on the damp tavern steps, listlessly
balancing their rifles between their knees, some smoking wooden
pipes, some dozing, some drinking early milk from a bucket brought
by a small, freckled lad who wore neither hat nor shoes.</p>

<p>"Do you desire some fresh milk, lady?" he asked, gazing solemnly
up at Silver Heels.</p>

<p>She smiled faintly, took the proffered dipper, and drank a little.</p>

<p>"No pay, lady," he said, as I drew out some coins which Foxcroft
had loaned me; "the redcoats are comin', and we need to for-ti-fy
the in-ner man&mdash;and the in-ner lady," he added, politely.</p>

<p>A soldier looked up and laughed.</p>

<p>"That's what the little rascal heard Captain Parker say," he
drawled, much amused, while the barefoot Ganymede withdrew, blushing
and embarrassed, to act as cup-bearer to others who had beckoned
him.</p>

<p>"We've got a hundred an' thirty militia here already," volunteered
a drummer-boy who lolled on the porch, fondling his wet drum;
"but Captain Parker, he let 'em go into the houses around the
green because he guesses the redcoats ain't a-comin', but I'm
to stay here an' drum like the devil if the redcoats come."</p>

<p>"An' I'm to fife if they come!" added another boy, stoutly.</p>

<p>I glanced down at the big, painted drum, all beaded with dew,
and I read "Louisburg" written in white letters on the hoops.</p>

<p>"We have some old Louisburg soldiers here," said the urchin,
proudly. "The redcoats say that we be all cowards, but I guess
we have fit battles for 'em long enough."</p>

<p>"You are over-young to fight in war," said Silver Heels, gently.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, we ain't!" they retorted, in a breath. "We'll give
'em 'Yankee Doodle' this time, my lady!"</p>

<p>"'Yankee Doodle,'" repeated Silver Heels, mystified.</p>

<p>"A foolish song the British play in Boston to plague us," I explained.</p>

<p>Presently Silver Heels touched my arm. "See yonder&mdash;look at that
man, down there in the road! See him running now, Michael!"</p>

<p>I turned and looked down the Boston Road; the little barelegged
drummer stood up.</p>

<p>Faintly came the far cry through the misty chill: "The British
are coming! The British are coming!"</p>

<p>The next instant the wet, stringy drum banged and buzzed on the
tavern porch, drowning all other sounds in our ears; a score of
men stumbled to their feet, rifles in hand; the little fifer blew
a whistling call, then ran out into the road.</p>

<p>At that same moment our post-chaise lumbered around the corner
of the tavern yard and drew up before us, Mount acting as post-boy,
and Foxcroft and the Weasel riding together in the rear.</p>

<p>Mount apprehended the situation at a glance; he motioned me to
place Silver Heels in the chaise, which I did, with my eyes still
fixed on the foggy Boston Road.</p>

<p>"Is it a false alarm?" inquired Foxcroft, anxiously, as a few
of the militia came running past our chaise. "Ho! Harrington!
Hey! Bob Monroe! Is it true they are coming, lads?"</p>

<p>Harrington and Monroe, whom I had met in Boston at the "Wild
Goose," waved their arms to us, and called out that it was doubtless
true.</p>

<p>"Which way?" cried Foxcroft, standing up in his stirrups.</p>

<p>But the militia and Minute Men ran out without answering, and
joined the line which was slowly forming on the green, while the
old Louisburg drum rolled, vibrating sonorously, and the fife's
shrill treble pierced the air.</p>

<p>There was a uniformed officer in front of the ragged line, shouting
orders, gesticulating, pushing men into place; some sidled nearer
to their comrades as though for shelter, many craned their necks
like alarmed turkeys, a few huddled into groups, charging and
priming their pieces&mdash;some threescore yokels in all, though others
were running from the houses and joining the single rank, adding
to the disorder and confusion. And all the while the old Louisburg
drum thundered the assembly.</p>

<p>"Cardigan, which way are they coming?" cried Foxcroft, still
standing up in his stirrups. "They say there are redcoats behind
us and more in front of us!"</p>

<p>"Do those ragged rascals mean to face a British army?" exclaimed
Mount, reining in his horse, which had begun to rear at the noise
of the drum.</p>

<p>"Turn your horses, Jack!" I said, holding Warlock by the head;
"turn back towards Concord!"</p>

<p>"There's redcoats on the Concord Road!" cried a woman, running
out of a house close by. I saw her hurry across to the village
green, carrying a sack of home-moulded bullets.</p>

<p>Jonathan Harrington caught her arm, took the bullet-pouch, kissed
her; then she hastened back to the little house and stood at the
window, peering out with white face pressed to the dark glass.</p>

<p>I flung myself astride Warlock, wheeled the restless horse, and
ranged up alongside Mount.</p>

<p>"Can we not take the Bedford Road?" I asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"They say the British are betwixt us and the west," replied Mount.
His eyes had begun to burn with a steady, fierce light; he sat
astride the off horse, cocking and uncocking his rifle.</p>

<p>"Then we should make for the Boston Road!" I said, impatiently;
"we can't stay here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look yonder!" broke in Foxcroft, excitedly.</p>

<p>Out into the Boston Road, in the gray haze of dawn, trotted a
British officer, superbly mounted. The pale light glimmered on
his silver gorget; the gold on his sleeves and hat sparkled.</p>

<p>Straight on his heels marched the British infantry, moving walls
of scarlet topped with shining steel, rank after rank, in magnificent
alignment, pouring steadily into the square, with never a drum-beat
to time the perfect precision of their black-gaitered legs.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried a far voice; the red ranks stood as one man. An
officer galloped alongside of the motionless lines, and, leaning
forward in his saddle, shouted to the disordered group of farmers,
"Stop that drum!"</p>

<p>"Fall in! Fall in!" roared the captain of the militia; the old
Louisburg drum thundered louder yet.</p>

<p>"Prime! Load!" cried the British officers, and the steady call
was repeated from company to company, and yet to companies unseen,
far down the Boston Road.</p>

<p>Twoscore of spectators had now so hemmed in our post-chaise that
we could not move without crushing them, yet I struggled ceaselessly
to back the vehicle into the stable-yard, and Foxcroft begged
the crowd to move and let the chaise pass.</p>

<p>We had scarcely succeeded in reaching the corner of the yard,
and the body of the chaise was now safe from bullets, when a British
major galloped into the green, motioning violently to the militia
with his drawn sword.</p>

<p>"Disperse! Disperse!" he called out, angrily.</p>

<p>"Stand your ground!" roared the militia captain. "Don't fire
unless fired upon! But if they mean to have a war, let it begin
here!"</p>

<p>"Disperse!" shouted the British major. "Lay down your arms! Why
don't you lay down your arms and disperse&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shot cut him short; his horse gave a great bound, backed, lashed
out with both hind feet, then reared in agony.</p>

<p>"My God! they've shot his horse!" cried Foxcroft.</p>

<p>"'Tis his own men, then," broke in Mount; "I marked the smoke."</p>

<p>"Disperse!" bellowed the maddened officer, dragging his horse
to a stand-still&mdash;"disperse, ye rebels!"</p>

<p>Behind a stone wall a farmer rose and presented his firelock,
but the piece flashed in the pan. A shot rang out, but I could
not see who fired.</p>

<p>Far down the Boston Road the solid front of a second British
column appeared.</p>

<p>Already some of the Minute Men were quitting the single, disordered
rank on the green which still wavered, facing the regulars; but
their captain continued in front of his men, and the drummer still
drummed his hoarse challenge.</p>

<p>Then a British officer fired his pistol from the saddle, and,
before any one could move or lift a finger, a bright sheet of
flame girdled the British front, and the deafening roar of musketry
shook the earth.</p>

<p>Through the low rushing billows of smoke that gushed out over
the ground like foam, I saw the British major rise in his stirrups,
and, reversing his sword, drive it downward as signal to cease
firing. Other officers rode up through the smoke, shouting orders
which were lost in the dropping shots from the militia, now retreating
on a run past us up the Bedford Road.</p>

<p>"Look at Harrington," cried Mount; "he's down under that smoke!"</p>

<p>But Harrington rose, and reeled away towards his own house. I
saw his wife at the door; the wounded man also saw her, and feebly
stretched out his hands as though calling for aid, then he pitched
forward on his face and lay still, one hand clutching his own
door-step.</p>

<p>"Halt!" shouted the British major, plunging about on his wounded
horse through the smoke. "Stop that firing! D'ye hear what I say?
Stop it! Stop it!" And again and again he reversed his sword in
frantic signals which no one heeded.</p>

<p>An officer cantered up, calling out: "Major Pitcairn! Major Pitcairn!
Are you hit, sir?"</p>

<p>A volley from the British Tenth Foot drowned his voice, and the
red-coated soldiers came bursting through the smoke on a double-quick,
shouting and hoisting their mitre-caps on the points of their
bayonets. Behind them the grenadiers rushed forward, cheering.</p>

<p>A soldier of the light infantry in front of the Meeting-house
flung up his musket and fired at an old man who was hobbling across
the street; shots came quicker and quicker; I saw my acquaintance,
Monroe, attempt to traverse the road towards the tavern; he was
rolling in the mud ere he had taken two steps. A grenadier ran
after a lank farmer and caught him by the collar; the farmer tripped
up the redcoat and started to run, but they brought him to his
knees in the road, and then shot him to death under their very
feet.</p>

<p>I galloped to the chaise and jerked the horses back, then wheeled
them westward towards Bedford, where the remnants of the militia
were sullenly falling back, firing across at the British, now
marching on past the Meeting-house up the Concord Road.</p>

<p>"No! No!" cried Foxcroft, "we cannot risk it! Stay where you
are!"</p>

<p>"We cannot risk being butchered here!" I replied. Silver Heels
was standing straight up in the chaise, one hand holding to the
leather curtain. Her face had grown very white.</p>

<p>"They've killed a poor young man behind that barn!" she whispered,
as I leaned from my saddle and motioned her to crouch low. "They
shot him twice, and struck him with their muskets!"</p>

<p>I glanced hastily towards the barn and saw a dark heap lying
in the grass behind it. Three red-coated soldiers stood near,
loading their muskets and laughing.</p>

<p>"Look at the Weasel!" muttered Mount, jerking my arm as my horse
ranged up beside his.</p>

<p>The Weasel was hastily climbing out of his saddle, rifle in hand.
His face, which a few moments before had been haggard and vacant,
had grown flushed and eager, his eyes snapped with intelligence,
his head was erect, and his movements quick as a forest-cat's.</p>

<p>"Cade!" quavered Mount. "Cade, old friend, what are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Come!" cried the Weasel, briskly; "can't you see the redskins?"</p>

<p>"Redcoats! Redcoats!" cried Mount, anxiously. "Where are you
going, Cade? Come back! Come back! They can't hit us here! Redcoats,
Cade, not redskins!"</p>

<p>"They be all one to me!" replied the Weasel, briskly, scuttling
away to cover under a tuft of hazel.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot, Cade!" bawled Mount. "Wait till we can gather our
people! Wait! Hell and damnation! don't fire!"</p>

<p>"Bang!" went the Weasel's long brown rifle; a red-coated soldier
on the Concord Road dropped.</p>

<p>"He's done it! God help us!" groaned Foxcroft.</p>

<p>"Hold those horses!" said Mount, desperately. I seized the leaders,
Mount slipped from his saddle to the ground, and ran out to the
long, dead grass behind the Meeting-house. I could see him catch
the Weasel by the arm and attempt to drag him back by force, but
the mad little creature clung obstinately to his patch of hazel.</p>

<p>"He won't come!" shouted Mount, turning towards me.</p>

<p>As he turned, I saw the entire British column marching swiftly
up the Concord Road, a small flanking party thrown out on the
right. The Weasel also saw the troops and made haste to level
his rifle again, but Mount fell upon him and dragged him down
into the marsh-grass.</p>

<p>From the Bedford Road our militia fired slowly across at the
fast vanishing troops on the Concord Road; the British flanking
party returned the fire, but the main column paid no heed to the
shots, and pressed on in silence, without music, without banners,
without a drum-tap to mark their rapid march. No British soldiers
came our way; they appeared to disdain the groups of militia retreating
along the Bedford Road; their rear-guard fired a few scattering
shots into "Buckman's Tavern" at long range, then ran on to keep
in touch with the main body.</p>

<p>Both the Weasel and Mount were now deliberately firing at the
British flanking party, which had halted on a bit of ploughed
ground, and seemed to be undecided whether to continue their march
or return and punish the two foolhardy riflemen whose bullets
had already knocked one big soldier flat on his back across the
fresh furrows.</p>

<p>All at once six red-coated soldiers started running towards Jack
Mount and the Weasel. I shouted to warn the infatuated men. Silver
Heels caught my arm.</p>

<p>"I cannot leave them there!" I stammered; "I must go to them!"</p>

<p>"Foxcroft will guard me!" she murmured. "Go to them, dearest!"</p>

<p>"Foxcroft! Hold these horses!" I cried, flinging Warlock's bridle
to him, and slipping out of my saddle.</p>

<p>Rifle a-trail, I ran across the road, leaped the fence, and plunged
into the low bushes. Jack Mount turned a cool, amused eye on me
as I came up.</p>

<p>"The Weasel is right," he said, triumphantly; "we'll catch a
half-dozen red-birds now. Be ready when I draw their fire, lad;
then drop and run forward through the swamp! You know how the
Senecas fight. We'll catch them alive!"</p>

<p>Over the tops of the low bushes I could see the soldiers coming
towards us, muskets half raised, scanning the cover for the game
they meant to bag, thrusting their bayonets into bushes, beating
the long grass with their gunstocks to flush the skulking quarry
for a snap-shot.</p>

<p>Without warning, Mount rose, then sank to the ground as a volley
rattled out; and instantly we three ran forward, bent double.
In a moment more I sprang up from the swamp-grass beside a soldier
and knocked him flat with a blow from my rifle-stock. Mount shot
at another and missed him, but the fellow promptly threw down
his musket, yelling lustily for quarter.</p>

<p>The four remaining soldiers attempted to load, but the Weasel
tripped up one, with a cartridge half bitten in his mouth, and
the other three were chased and caught by some Acton militia,
who came leaping across the swampy covert from the Bedford Road.</p>

<p>When the Acton men returned with their prisoners, the soldier
whom I had struck was sitting up in the swamp-grass, rubbing his
powdered head and staring wildly at his sweating and anxious comrades.</p>

<p>"That's the fellow who murdered Harrington!" said one of the
militia, and drew up his rifle with a jerk.</p>

<p>"Use these prisoners well, or I'll knock your head off!" roared
Mount, striking up the rifle.</p>

<p>An officer of Minute Men came up; his eyes were red as though
he had been weeping.</p>

<p>"They butchered his brother behind the red barn yonder," whispered
a lean yokel beside me. "He'll hang 'em, that's what he'll do."</p>

<p>"That's it! Hang 'em!" bawled out a red-headed lout, flourishing
a pitchfork. "Hang the damn&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Put that fool under arrest," said the officer, sharply. Some
Acton Minute Men seized the lout and hustled him off; others formed
a guard and conducted the big, perspiring, red-coated soldiers
towards "Buckman's Tavern."</p>

<p>"You will treat them humanely?" I asked, as the officer passed
me.</p>

<p>He gave me a blank glance; the tears again had filled his eyes.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said, shortly; "I am not a butcher."</p>

<p>I gave him the officer's salute; he returned it absently, and
walked on, with drawn sword and head sunk on his tarnished brass
gorget.</p>

<p>A restless, silent crowd had gathered at "Buckman's Tavern,"
where two dead Minute Men lay on the porch, stiffening in their
blood.</p>

<p>The sun had not yet risen, but all the east was turning yellow;
great clouds of red-winged blackbirds rose and settled in the
swampy meadows, and filled the air with their dry chirking; robins
sang ecstatically.</p>

<p>Back along the muddy Bedford Road trudged the remnants of the
scattered Lexington company of militia; the little barelegged
drummer posted himself in front of the Meeting-house once more,
and drummed the assembly. Men seemed to spring from the soil;
every bramble-patch was swarming now; they came hurrying across
the distant fields singly, in twos and threes, in scores.</p>

<p>Far away in the vague dawn bells rang out in distant villages,
and I heard the faint sound of guns and the throbbing of drums.
I passed the Lexington company re-forming on the trodden village
green. Their captain, Parker, called out to me: "Forest-runner!
We need your rifle! Will you fight with us?"</p>

<p>"I cannot," I said, and ran towards the post-chaise, rifle on
shoulder.</p>

<p>The women and children of Lexington were gathered around it.
I saw at a glance that Silver Heels had given her seat to a frightened
old woman, and that other women were thrusting their children
into the vehicle, imploring Mount and Foxcroft to save them from
the British.</p>

<p>"Michael," said Silver Heels, looking up with cool gray eyes,
"the British are firing at women in the farm-houses on the Concord
Road above here. We must get the children away."</p>

<p>"And you?" I asked, sharply. She lifted a barefooted urchin into
the chaise without answering.</p>

<p>A yoke of dusty, anxious oxen, drawing a hay-cart, came clattering
up, the poor beasts running heavily, while their driver followed
on a trot beside them, using his cruel goad without mercy.</p>

<p>"Haw! Haw! Gee! Gee! Haw!" he bellowed, guiding his bumping wagon
into the Bedford Road.</p>

<p>"The children here!" called out Silver Heels, in her clear voice,
and caught up another wailing infant, to soothe it and lift it
into the broad ox-wagon.</p>

<p>In a moment the wagon was full of old women and frantic children;
a young girl, carrying a baby, ran alongside, begging piteously
for a place, but already other vehicles were rattling up behind
gaunt, rusty horses, and places were found for the frightened
little ones in the confusion.</p>

<p>Some boys drove a flock of sheep into the Bedford Road; a herd
of young cattle broke and ran, scattering the sheep. Mount and
I sprang in front of Silver Heels, driving the cattle aside with
clubbed rifles. Then there came a heavy pounding of horses' hoofs
in the mud, a rush, a cry, and a hatless, coatless rider drew
up in a cloud of scattering gravel.</p>

<p>"More troops coming from Boston!" he shouted in his saddle. "Lord
Percy is at Roxbury with three regiments, marines, and cannon!
Paul Revere was taken at one o'clock this morning!" And away he
galloped, head bent low, reeking spurs clinging to his horse's
gaunt flanks.</p>

<p>Silver Heels, standing beside me in the hanging morning mist,
laid her hand on my arm.</p>

<p>"If the British are at Roxbury," she said, "we are quite cut
off, are we not?"</p>

<p>I did not answer. Mount turned a grave, intelligent eye on me;
Foxcroft came up, wiping the mud and sweat from his eyes.</p>

<p>At that moment the drum and fife sounded from the green; the
Lexington company, arms trailing, came marching into the Bedford
Road, Indian file, Captain Parker leading.</p>

<p>Beside him, joyous, alert, transfigured, trotted the Weasel.
"We've got them now!" he called out to Mount. "We'll catch the
redskins with our hands at Charlestown Neck!"</p>

<p>The little barelegged drummer nodded seriously; the old Louisburg
drum rumbled out the route-march.</p>

<p>Into "Buckman's Tavern" filed the Lexington men and fell to slamming
and bolting the wooden shutters, piercing the doors and walls
for rifle-fire, piling tables and chairs and bedding along the
veranda for a rough breastwork.</p>

<p>"You must come with the convoy," I said, taking Silver Heels
by the hand.</p>

<p>Her grave, gray eyes met mine in perfect composure.</p>

<p>"We must stay," she said.</p>

<p>"They are bringing cannon&mdash;can you not understand?" I repeated,
harshly.</p>

<p>"I will not go," she said. "Every rifle is required here. I cannot
take you from these men in their dire need. Dear heart, can you
not understand me?"</p>

<p>"Am I to sacrifice you?" I asked, angrily. "No!" I cried. "We
have suffered enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tears sprang to her eyes; she laid her hand on my rifle.</p>

<p>"Other women have sent their dearest ones. Am I less brave than
that woman whose husband died yonder on his own door-sill? Am
I a useless, passionless clod, that my blood stirs at naught but
pleasure? Look at those dead men on the tavern steps! Look at
our people's blood on the grass yonder! Would you wed with a pink-and-white
thing whose veins run water? I saw them kill that poor boy behind
his own barn!&mdash;these redcoat ruffians who come across an ocean
to slay us in our own land. Do you forget I am a soldier's child?"</p>

<p>A loud voice bellowing from the tavern: "Women here for the bullet-moulds!
Get your women to the tavern!"</p>

<p>She caught my hand. "You see a maid may not stand idle in Lexington!"
she said, with a breathless smile.</p>
