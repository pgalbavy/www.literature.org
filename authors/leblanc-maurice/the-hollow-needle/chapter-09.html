<p>The Etretat Needle was hollow!
</p><p>Was it a natural phenomenon, an excavation produced by internal
cataclysms or by the imperceptible action of the rushing sea and the
soaking rain? Or was it a superhuman work executed by human beings,
Gauls, Celts, prehistoric men?
</p><p>These, no doubt, were insoluble questions; and what did it matter? The
essence of the thing was contained in this fact: The Needle was hollow.
At forty or fifty yards from that imposing arch which is called the
Porte d'Aval and which shoots out from the top of the cliff, like the
colossal branch of a tree, to take root in the submerged rocks, stands
an immense limestone cone; and this cone is no more than the shell of a
pointed cap poised upon the empty waters!
</p><p>A prodigious revelation! After Lupin, here was Beautrelet discovering
the key to the great riddle that had loomed over more than twenty
centuries! A key of supreme importance to whoever possessed it in the
days of old, in those distant times when hordes of barbarians rode
through and overran the old world! A magic key that opens the cyclopean
cavern to whole tribes fleeing before the enemy! A mysterious key that
guards the door of the most inviolable shelter! An enchanted key that
gives power and ensures preponderance!
</p><p>Because he knows this key, Caesar is able to subdue Gaul. Because they
know it, the Normans force their sway upon the country and, from there,
later, backed by that support, conquer the neighboring island, conquer
Sicily, conquer the East, conquer the new world!
</p><p>Masters of the secret, the Kings of England lord it over France, humble
her, dismember her, have themselves crowned at Paris. They lose the
secret; and the rout begins.
</p><p>Masters of the secret, the Kings of France push back and overstep the
narrow limits of their dominion, gradually founding a great nation and
radiating with glory and power. They forget it or know not how to use
it; and death, exile, ruin follow.
</p><p>An invisible kingdom, in mid-water and at ten fathoms from land! An
unknown fortress, taller than the towers of Notre Dame and built upon a
granite foundation larger than a public square! What strength and what
security! From Paris to the sea, by the Seine. There, the Havre, the
new town, the necessary town. And, sixteen miles thence, the Hollow
Needle, the impregnable sanctuary!
</p><p>It is a sanctuary and also a stupendous hiding-place. All the treasures
of the kings, increasing from century to century, all the gold of
France, all that they extort from the people, all that they snatch from
the clergy, all the booty gathered on the battle-fields of Europe lie
heaped up in the royal cave. Old Merovingian gold sous, glittering
crown-pieces, doubloons, ducats, florins, guineas; and the precious
stones and the diamonds; and all the jewels and all the ornaments:
everything is there. Who could discover it? Who could ever learn the
impenetrable secret of the Needle? Nobody.
</p><p>And Lupin becomes that sort of really disproportionate being whom we
know, that miracle incapable of explanation so long as the truth
remains in the shadow. Infinite though the resources of his genius be,
they cannot suffice for the mad struggle which he maintains against
society. He needs other, more material resources. He needs a sure place
of retreat, he needs the certainty of impunity, the peace that allows
of the execution of his plans.
</p><p>Without the Hollow Needle, Lupin is incomprehensible, a myth, a
character in a novel, having no connection with reality.
</p><p>Master of the secret--and of such a secret!--he becomes simply a man
like another, but gifted with the power of wielding in a superior
manner the extraordinary weapon with which destiny has endowed him.
</p><hr/>
<p>So the Needle was hollow.
</p><p>It remained to discover how one obtained access to it.
</p><p>From the sea, obviously. There must be, on the side of the offing, some
fissure where boats could land at certain hours of the tide.
</p><p>But on the side of the land?
</p><p>Beautrelet lay until ten o'clock at night hanging over the precipice,
with his eyes riveted on the shadowy mass formed by the pyramid,
thinking and pondering with all the concentrated effort of his mind.
</p><p>Then he went down to Etretat, selected the cheapest hotel, dined, went
up to his room and unfolded the document.
</p><p>It was the merest child's play to him now to establish its exact
meaning. He at once saw that the three vowels of the word Etretat
occurred in the first line, in their proper order and at the necessary
intervals. This first line now read as follows:
</p><p>  e . a . a .. etretat . a ..
</p><p>What words could come before Etretat? Words, no doubt, that referred to
the position of the Needle with regard to the town. Now the Needle
stood on the left, on the west--He ransacked his memory and,
recollecting that westerly winds are called vents d'aval on the coast
and that the nearest porte was known as the Porte d'Aval, he wrote down:
</p><p>  "En aval d'Etretat . a .."
</p><p>The second line was that containing the word Demoiselles and, at once
seeing, in front of that word, the series of all the vowels that form
part of the words la chambre des, he noted the two phrases:
</p><p>  "En aval d'Etretat. La Chambre des Demoiselles."
</p><p>The third line gave him more trouble; and it was not until some groping
that, remembering the position, near the Chambre des Demoiselles, of
the Fort de Frefosse, he ended by almost completely reconstructing the
document:
</p><p>  "En aval d'Etretat. La Chambre des Demoiselles. Sous le Fort de
  Frefosse. L'Aiguille creuse."
</p><p>These were the four great formulas, the essential and general formulas
which you had to know. By means of them, you turned en aval, that is to
say, below or west of Etretat, entered the Chambre des Demoiselles, in
all probability passed under Fort Frefosse and thus arrived at the
Needle.
</p><p>How? By means of the indications and measurements that constituted the
fourth line:
</p><p>[Illustration: drawing of an outline of paper with writing and drawing
on it--numbers, dots, some letters, signs and symbols...]
</p><p>These were evidently the more special formulas to enable you to find
the outlet through which you made your way and the road that led to the
Needle.
</p><p>Beautrelet at once presumed--and his surmise was no more than the
logical consequence of the document--that, if there really was a direct
communication between the land and the obelisk of the Needle, the
underground passage must start from the Chambre des Demoiselles, pass
under Fort Frefosse, descend perpendicularly the three hundred feet of
cliff and, by means of a tunnel contrived under the rocks of the sea,
end at the Hollow Needle.
</p><p>Which was the entrance to the underground passage? Did not the two
letters D and F, so plainly cut, point to it and admit to it, with the
aid, perhaps, of some ingenious piece of mechanism?
</p><p>The whole of the next morning, Isidore strolled about Etretat and
chatted with everybody he met, in order to try and pick up useful
information. At last, in the afternoon, he went up the cliff. Disguised
as a sailor, he had made himself still younger and, in a pair of
trousers too short for him and a fishing jersey, he looked a mere
scape-grace of twelve or thirteen.
</p><p>As soon as he entered the cave, he knelt down before the letters. Here
a disappointment awaited him. It was no use his striking them, pushing
them, manipulating them in every way: they refused to move. And it was
not long, in fact, before he became aware that they were really unable
to move and that, therefore, they controlled no mechanism.
</p><p>And yet--and yet they must mean something! Inquiries which he had made
in the village went to show that no one had ever been able to explain
their existence and that the Abbe Cochet, in his valuable little book
on Etretat,[8] had also tried in vain to solve this little puzzle. But
Isidore knew what the learned Norman archaeologist did not know,
namely, that the same two letters figured in the document, on the line
containing the indications. Was it a chance coincidence: Impossible.
Well, then--?
</p>
<p>[8] Les Origines d'Etretat. The Abbe Cochet seems to conclude,
in the end, that the two letters are the initials of a passer-by. The
revelations now made prove the fallacy of the theory.
</p>
<p>An idea suddenly occurred to him, an idea so reasonable, so simple that
he did not doubt its correctness for a second. Were not that D and that
F the initials of the two most important words in the document, the
words that represented--together with the Needle--the essential
stations on the road to be followed: the Chambre des Demoiselles and
Fort Frefosse: D for Demoiselles, F for Frefosse: the connection was
too remarkable to be a mere accidental fact.
</p><p>In that case, the problem stood thus: the two letters D F represent the
relation that exists between the Chambre des Demoiselles and Fort
Frefosse, the single letter D, which begins the line, represents the
Demoiselles, that is to say, the cave in which you have to begin by
taking up your position, and the single letter F, placed in the middle
of the line, represents Frefosse, that is to say, the probable entrance
to the underground passage.
</p><p>Between these various signs, are two more: first, a sort of irregular
rectangle, marked with a stripe in the left bottom corner, and, next,
the figure 19, signs which obviously indicate to those inside the cave
the means of penetrating beneath the fort.
</p><p>The shape of this rectangle puzzled Isidore. Was there around him, on
the walls of the cave, or at any rate within reach of his eyes, an
inscription, anything whatever, affecting a rectangular shape?
</p><p>He looked for a long time and was on the point of abandoning that
particular scent when his eyes fell upon the little opening, pierced in
the rock, that acted as a window to the chamber.
</p><p>Now the edges of this opening just formed a rectangle: corrugated,
uneven, clumsy, but still a rectangle; and Beautrelet at once saw that,
by placing his two feet on the D and the F carved in the stone
floor--and this explained the stroke that surmounted the two letters in
the document--he found himself at the exact height of the window!
</p><p>He took up his position in this place and gazed out. The window looking
landward, as we know, he saw, first, the path that connected the cave
with the land, a path hung between two precipices; and, next, he caught
sight of the foot of the hillock on which the fort stood. To try and
see the fort, Beautrelet leaned over to the left and it was then that
he understood the meaning of the curved stripe, the comma that marked
the left bottom corner in the document: at the bottom on the left-hand
side of the window, a piece of flint projected and the end of it was
curved like a claw. It suggested a regular shooter's mark. And, when a
man applied his eye to this mark, he saw cut out, on the slope of the
mound facing him, a restricted surface of land occupied almost entirely
by an old brick wall, a remnant of the original Fort Frefosse or of the
old Roman oppidum built on this spot.
</p><p>Beautrelet ran to this piece of wall, which was, perhaps, ten yards
long. It was covered with grass and plants. There was no indication of
any kind visible. And yet that figure 19?
</p><p>He returned to the cave, took from his pocket a ball of string and a
tape-measure, tied the string to the flint corner, fastened a pebble at
the nineteenth metre and flung it toward the land side. The pebble at
most reached the end of the path.
</p><p>"Idiot that I am!" thought Beautrelet. "Who reckoned by metres in those
days? The figure 19 means 19 fathoms[9] or nothing!"
</p>
<p>[9] The toise, or fathom, measured 1.949 metres.--Translator's Note.
</p>
<p>Having made the calculation, he ran out the twine, made a knot and felt
about on the piece of wall for the exact and necessarily one point at
which the knot, formed at 37 metres from the window of the Demoiselles,
should touch the Frefosse wall. In a few moments, the point of contact
was established. With his free hand, he moved aside the leaves of
mullein that had grown in the interstices. A cry escaped him. The knot,
which he held pressed down with his fore-finger, was in the centre of a
little cross carved in relief on a brick. And the sign that followed on
the figure 19 in the document was a cross!
</p><p>It needed all his will-power to control the excitement with which he
was overcome. Hurriedly, with convulsive fingers, he clutched the cross
and, pressing upon it, turned it as he would have turned the spokes of
a wheel. The brick heaved. He redoubled his effort; it moved no
further. Then, without turning, he pressed harder. He at once felt the
brick give way. And, suddenly, there was the click of a bolt that is
released, the sound of a lock opening and, on the right of the brick,
to the width of about a yard, the wall swung round on a pivot and
revealed the orifice of an underground passage.
</p><p>Like a madman, Beautrelet seized the iron door in which the bricks were
sealed, pulled it back, violently and closed it. Astonishment, delight,
the fear of being surprised convulsed his face so as to render it
unrecognizable. He beheld the awful vision of all that had happened
there, in front of that door, during twenty centuries; of all those
people, initiated into the great secret, who had penetrated through
that issue: Celts, Gauls, Romans, Normans, Englishmen, Frenchmen,
barons, dukes, kings--and, after all of them, Arsene Lupin--and, after
Lupin, himself, Beautrelet. He felt that his brain was slipping away
from him. His eyelids fluttered. He fell fainting and rolled to the
bottom of the slope, to the very edge of the precipice.
</p><hr/>
<p>His task was done, at least the task which he was able to accomplish
alone, with his unaided resources.
</p><p>That evening, he wrote a long letter to the chief of the detective
service, giving a faithful account of the results of his investigations
and revealing the secret of the Hollow Needle. He asked for assistance
to complete his work and gave his address.
</p><p>While waiting for the reply, he spent two consecutive nights in the
Chambre des Demoiselles. He spent them overcome with fear, his nerves
shaken with a terror which was increased by the sounds of the night. At
every moment, he thought he saw shadows approach in his direction.
People knew of his presence in the cave--they were coming--they were
murdering him!
</p><p>His eyes, however, staring madly before them, sustained by all the
power of his will, clung to the piece of wall.
</p><p>On the first night, nothing stirred; but, on the second, by the light
of the stars and a slender crescent-moon, he saw the door open and
figures emerge from the darkness: he counted two, three, four, five of
them.
</p><p>It seemed to him that those five men were carrying fairly large loads.
He followed them for a little way. They cut straight across the fields
to the Havre road; and he heard the sound of a motor car driving away.
</p><p>He retraced his steps, skirting a big farm. But, at the turn of the
road that ran beside it, he had only just time to scramble up a slope
and hide behind some trees. More men passed--four, five men--all
carrying packages. And, two minutes later, another motor snorted.
</p><p>This time, he had not the strength to return to his post; and he went
back to bed.
</p><p>When he woke and had finished dressing, the hotel waiter brought him a
letter. He opened it. It contained Ganimard's card.
</p><p>"At last!" cried Beautrelet, who, after so hard a campaign, was really
feeling the need of a comrade-in-arms.
</p><p>He ran downstairs with outstretched hands. Ganimard took them, looked
at him for a moment and said:
</p><p>"You're a fine fellow, my lad!"
</p><p>"Pooh!" he said. "Luck has served me."
</p><p>"There's no such thing as luck with 'him,'" declared the inspector, who
always spoke of Lupin in a solemn tone and without mentioning his name.
</p><p>He sat down:
</p><p>"So we've got him!"
</p><p>"Just as we've had him twenty times over," said Beautrelet, laughing.
</p><p>"Yes, but to-day--"
</p><p>"To-day, of course, the case is different. We know his retreat, his
stronghold, which means, when all is said, that Lupin is Lupin. He can
escape. The Etretat Needle cannot."
</p><p>"Why do you suppose that he will escape?" asked Ganimard, anxiously.
</p><p>"Why do you suppose that he requires to escape?" replied Beautrelet.
"There is nothing to prove that he is in the Needle at present. Last
night, eleven of his men left it. He may be one of the eleven."
</p><p>Ganimard reflected:
</p><p>"You are right. The great thing is the Hollow Needle. For the rest, let
us hope that chance will favor us. And now, let us talk."
</p><p>He resumed his serious voice, his self-important air and said:
</p><p>"My dear Beautrelet, I have orders to recommend you to observe the most
absolute discretion in regard to this matter."
</p><p>"Orders from whom?" asked Beautrelet, jestingly. "The prefect of
police?"
</p><p>"Higher than that."
</p><p>"The prime minister?"
</p><p>"Higher."
</p><p>"Whew!"
</p><p>Ganimard lowered his voice:
</p><p>"Beautrelet, I was at the Elysee last night. They look upon this matter
as a state secret of the utmost gravity. There are serious reasons for
concealing the existence of this citadel--reasons of military strategy,
in particular. It might become a revictualling centre, a magazine for
new explosives, for lately-invented projectiles, for anything of that
sort: the secret arsenal of France, in fact."
</p><p>"But how can they hope to keep a secret like this? In the old days, one
man alone held it: the king. To-day, already, there are a good few of
us who know it, without counting Lupin's gang."
</p><p>"Still, if we gained only ten years', only five years' silence! Those
five years may be--the saving of us."
</p><p>"But, in order to capture this citadel, this future arsenal, it will
have to be attacked, Lupin must be dislodged. And all this cannot be
done without noise."
</p><p>"Of course, people will guess something, but they won't know. Besides,
we can but try."
</p><p>"All right. What's your plan?"
</p><p>"Here it is, in two words. To begin with, you are not Isidore
Beautrelet and there's no question of Arsene Lupin either. You are and
you remain a small boy of Etretat, who, while strolling about the
place, caught some fellows coming out of an underground passage. This
makes you suspect the existence of a flight of steps which cuts through
the cliff from top to bottom."
</p><p>"Yes, there are several of those flights of steps along the coast. For
instance, to the right of Etretat, opposite Benouville, they showed me
the Devil's Staircase, which every bather knows. And I say nothing of
the three or four tunnels used by the fishermen."
</p><p>"So you will guide me and one-half of my men. I shall enter alone, or
accompanied, that remains to be seen. This much is certain, that the
attack must be delivered that way. If Lupin is not in the Needle, we
shall fix up a trap in which he will be caught sooner or later. If he
is there--"
</p><p>"If he is there, he will escape from the Needle by the other side, the
side overlooking the sea."
</p><p>"In that case, he will at once be arrested by the other half of my men."
</p><p>"Yes, but if, as I presume, you choose a moment when the sea is at low
ebb, leaving the base of the Needle uncovered, the chase will be
public, because it will take place before all the men and women fishing
for mussels, shrimps and shell-fish who swarm on the rocks round about."
</p><p>"That is why I just mean to select the time when the sea is full."
</p><p>"In that case, he will make off in a boat."
</p><p>"Ah, but I shall have a dozen fishing-smacks, each of which will be
commanded by one of my men, and we shall collar him--"
</p><p>"If he doesn't slip through your dozen smacks, like a fish through the
meshes."
</p><p>"All right, then I'll sink him."
</p><p>"The devil you will! Shall you have guns?"
</p><p>"Why, of course! There's a torpedo-boat at the Havre at this moment. A
telegram from me will bring her to the Needle at the appointed hour."
</p><p>"How proud Lupin will be! A torpedo-boat! Well, M. Ganimard, I see that
you have provided for everything. We have only to go ahead. When do we
deliver the assault?"
</p><p>"To-morrow."
</p><p>"At night?"
</p><p>"No, by daylight, at the flood-tide, as the clock strikes ten in the
morning."
</p><p>"Capital."
</p><hr/>
<p>Under his show of gaiety, Beautrelet concealed a real anguish of mind.
He did not sleep until the morning, but lay pondering over the most
impracticable schemes, one after the other.
</p><p>Ganimard had left him in order to go to Yport, six or seven miles from
Etretat, where, for prudence's sake, he had told his men to meet him,
and where he chartered twelve fishing smacks, with the ostensible
object of taking soundings along the coast.
</p><p>At a quarter to ten, escorted by a body of twelve stalwart men, he met
Isidore at the foot of the road that goes up the cliff.
</p><p>At ten o'clock exactly, they reached the skirt of wall. It was the
decisive moment.
</p><p>At ten o'clock exactly.
</p><p>"Why, what's the matter with you, Beautrelet?" jeered Ganimard. "You're
quite green in the face!"
</p><p>"It's as well you can't see yourself, Ganimard," the boy retorted. "One
would think your last hour had come!"
</p><p>They both had to sit down and Ganimard swallowed a few mouthfuls of rum.
</p><p>"It's not funk," he said, "but, by Jove, this is an exciting business!
Each time that I'm on the point of catching him, it takes me like that
in the pit of the stomach. A dram of rum?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"And if you drop behind?"
</p><p>"That will mean that I'm dead."
</p><p>"B-r-r-r-r! However, we'll see. And now, open, sesame! No danger of our
being observed, I suppose?"
</p><p>"No. The Needle is not so high as the cliff, and, besides, there's a
bend in the ground where we are."
</p><p>Beautrelet went to the wall and pressed upon the brick. The bolt was
released and the underground passage came in sight.
</p><p>By the gleam of the lanterns which they lit, they saw that it was cut
in the shape of a vault and that both the vaulting and the floor itself
were entirely covered with bricks.
</p><p>They walked for a few seconds and, suddenly, a staircase appeared.
Beautrelet counted forty-five brick steps, which the slow action of
many footsteps had worn away in the middle.
</p><p>"Blow!" said Ganimard, holding his head and stopping suddenly, as
though he had knocked against something.
</p><p>"What is it?"
</p><p>"A door."
</p><p>"Bother!" muttered Beautrelet, looking at it. "And not an easy one to
break down either. It's just a solid block of iron."
</p><p>"We are done," said Ganimard. "There's not even a lock to it."
</p><p>"Exactly. That's what gives me hope."
</p><p>"Why?"
</p><p>"A door is made to open; and, as this one has no lock, that means that
there is a secret way of opening it."
</p><p>"And, as we don't know the secret--"
</p><p>"I shall know it in a minute."
</p><p>"How?"
</p><p>"By means of the document. The fourth line has no other object but to
solve each difficulty as and when it crops up. And the solution is
comparatively easy, because it's not written with a view to throwing
searchers off the scent, but to assisting them."
</p><p>"Comparatively easy! I don't agree with you," cried Ganimard, who had
unfolded the document. "The number 44 and a triangle with a dot in it:
that doesn't tell us much!"
</p><p>"Yes, yes, it does! Look at the door. You see it's strengthened, at
each corner, with a triangular slab of iron; and the slabs are fixed
with big nails. Take the left-hand bottom slab and work the nail in the
corner: I'll lay ten to one we've hit the mark."
</p><p>"You've lost your bet," said Ganimard, after trying.
</p><p>"Then the figure 44 must mean--"
</p><p>In a low voice, reflecting as he spoke, Beautrelet continued:
</p><p>"Let me see--Ganimard and I are both standing on the bottom step of the
staircase--there are 45. Why 45, when the figure in the document is 44?
A coincidence? No. In all this business, there is no such thing as a
coincidence, at least not an involuntary one. Ganimard, be so good as
to move one step higher up. That's it, don't leave this forty-fourth
step. And now I will work the iron nail. And the trick's done, or I'll
eat my boots!"
</p><p>The heavy door turned on its hinges. A fairly spacious cavern appeared
before their eyes.
</p><p>"We must be exactly under Fort Frefosse," said Beautrelet. "We have
passed through the different earthy layers by now. There will be no
more brick. We are in the heart of the solid limestone."
</p><p>The room was dimly lit by a shaft of daylight that came from the other
end. Going up to it, they saw that it was a fissure in the cliff,
contrived in a projecting wall and forming a sort of observatory. In
front of them, at a distance of fifty yards, the impressive mass of the
Needle loomed from the waves. On the right, quite close, was the arched
buttress of the Porte d'Aval and, on the left, very far away, closing
the graceful curve of a large inlet, another rocky gateway, more
imposing still, was cut out of the cliff; the Manneporte,[10] which was
so wide and tall that a three-master could have passed through it with
all sail set. Behind and everywhere, the sea.
</p>
<p>[10] Magna porta.
</p>
<p>"I don't see our little fleet," said Beautrelet.
</p><p>"I know," said Ganimard. "The Porte d'Aval hides the whole of the coast
of Etretat and Yport. But look, over there, in the offing, that black
line, level with the water--"
</p><p>"Well?"
</p><p>"That's our fleet of war, Torpedo-boat No. 25. With her there, Lupin is
welcome to break loose--if he wants to study the landscape at the
bottom of the sea."
</p><p>A baluster marked the entrance to the staircase, near the fissure. They
started on their way down. From time to time, a little window pierced
the wall of the cliff; and, each time, they caught sight of the Needle,
whose mass seemed to them to grow more and more colossal.
</p><p>A little before reaching high-water level, the windows ceased and all
was dark.
</p><p>Isidore counted the steps aloud. At the three hundred and fifty-eight,
they emerged into a wider passage, which was barred by another iron
door strengthened with slabs and nails.
</p><p>"We know all about this," said Beautrelet. "The document gives us 357
and a triangle dotted on the right. We have only to repeat the
performance."
</p><p>The second door obeyed like the first. A long, a very long tunnel
appeared, lit up at intervals by the gleam of a lantern swung from the
vault. The walls oozed moisture and drops of water fell to the ground,
so that, to make walking easier a regular pavement of planks had been
laid from end to end.
</p><p>"We are passing under the sea," said Beautrelet. "Are you coming,
Ganimard?"
</p><p>Without replying, the inspector ventured into the tunnel, followed the
wooden foot-plank and stopped before a lantern, which he took down.
</p><p>"The utensils may date back to the Middle Ages, but the lighting is
modern," he said. "Our friends use incandescent mantles."
</p><p>He continued his way. The tunnel ended in another and a larger cave,
with, on the opposite side, the first steps of a staircase that led
upward.
</p><p>"It's the ascent of the Needle beginning," said Ganimard. "This is more
serious."
</p><p>But one of his men called him:
</p><p>"There's another flight here, sir, on the left."
</p><p>And, immediately afterward, they discovered a third, on the right.
</p><p>"The deuce!" muttered the inspector. "This complicates matters. If we
go by this way, they'll make tracks by that."
</p><p>"Shall we separate?" asked Beautrelet.
</p><p>"No, no--that would mean weakening ourselves. It would be better for
one of us to go ahead and scout."
</p><p>"I will, if you like--"
</p><p>"Very well, Beautrelet, you go. I will remain with my men--then there
will be no fear of anything. There may be other roads through the cliff
than that by which we came and several roads also through the Needle.
But it is certain that, between the cliff and the Needle, there is no
communication except the tunnel. Therefore they must pass through this
cave. And so I shall stay here till you come back. Go ahead,
Beautrelet, and be prudent: at the least alarm, scoot back again."
</p><p>Isidore disappeared briskly up the middle staircase. At the thirtieth
step, a door, an ordinary wooden door, stopped him. He seized the
handle turned it. The door was not locked.
</p><p>He entered a room that seemed to him very low owing to its immense
size. Lit by powerful lamps and supported by squat pillars, with long
vistas showing between them, it had nearly the same dimensions as the
Needle itself. It was crammed with packing cases and miscellaneous
objects--pieces of furniture, oak settees, chests, credence-tables,
strong-boxes--a whole confused heap of the kind which one sees in the
basement of an old curiosity shop.
</p><p>On his right and left, Beautrelet perceived the wells of two
staircases, the same, no doubt, that started from the cave below. He
could easily have gone down, therefore, and told Ganimard. But a new
flight of stairs led upward in front of him and he had the curiosity to
pursue his investigations alone.
</p><p>Thirty more steps. A door and then a room, not quite so large as the
last, Beautrelet thought. And again, opposite him, an ascending flight
of stairs.
</p><p>Thirty steps more. A door. A smaller room.
</p><p>Beautrelet grasped the plan of the works executed inside the Needle. It
was a series or rooms placed one above the other and, therefore,
gradually decreasing in size. They all served as store-rooms.
</p><p>In the fourth, there was no lamp. A little light filtered in through
clefts in the walls and Beautrelet saw the sea some thirty feet below
him.
</p><p>At that moment, he felt himself so far from Ganimard that a certain
anguish began to take hold of him and he had to master his nerves lest
he should take to his heels. No danger threatened him, however, and the
silence around him was even so great that he asked himself whether the
whole Needle had not been abandoned by Lupin and his confederates.
</p><p>"I shall not go beyond the next floor," he said to himself.
</p><p>Thirty stairs again and a door. This door was lighter in construction
and modern in appearance. He pushed it open gently, quite prepared for
flight. There was no one there. But the room differed from the others
in its purpose. There were hangings on the walls, rugs on the floor.
Two magnificent sideboards, laden with gold and silver plate, stood
facing each other. The little windows contrived in the deep, narrow
cleft were furnished with glass panes.
</p><p>In the middle of the room was a richly-decked table, with a lace-edged
cloth, dishes of fruits and cakes, champagne in decanters and flowers,
heaps of flowers.
</p><p>Three places were laid around the table.
</p><p>Beautrelet walked up. On the napkins were cards with the names of the
party. He read first:
</p><p>"Arsene Lupin."
</p><p>"Mme. Arsene Lupin."
</p><p>He took up the third card and started back with surprise. It bore his
own name:
</p><p>"Isidore Beautrelet!"
