<p>The <em>Tobermory</em> was no ship for passengers. Its decks
were littered with a hundred oddments, so that a man could barely
walk a step without tacking, and my bunk was simply a shelf in
the frowsty little saloon, where the odour of ham and eggs hung
like a fog. I joined her at Greenock and took a turn on deck with
the captain after tea, when he told me the names of the big blue
hills to the north. He had a fine old copper-coloured face and
side-whiskers like an archbishop, and, having spent all his days
beating up the western seas, had as many yarns in his head as
Peter himself.</p>

<p>"On this boat," he announced, "we don’t ken what a day may bring
forth. I may put into Colonsay for twa hours and bide there three
days. I get a telegram at Oban and the next thing I’m awa ayont
Barra. Sheep’s the difficult business. They maun be fetched for
the sales, and they’re dooms slow to lift. So ye see it’s not
what ye call a pleasure trip, Maister Brand."</p>

<p>Indeed it wasn’t, for the confounded tub wallowed like a fat
sow as soon as we rounded a headland and got the weight of the
south-western wind. When asked my purpose, I explained that I
was a colonial of Scots extraction, who was paying his first visit
to his fatherland and wanted to explore the beauties of the West
Highlands. I let him gather that I was not rich in this world’s
goods.</p>

<p>"Ye’ll have a passport?" he asked. "They’ll no let ye go north
o’ Fort William without one."</p>

<p>Amos had said nothing about passports, so I looked blank.</p>

<p>"I could keep ye on board for the whole voyage," he went on,
"but ye wouldna be permitted to land. If ye’re seekin’ enjoyment,
it would be a poor job sittin’ on this deck and admirin’ the works
o’ God and no allowed to step on the pier-head. Ye should have
applied to the military gentlemen in Glesca. But ye’ve plenty
o’ time to make up your mind afore we get to Oban. We’ve a heap
o’ calls to make Mull and Islay way."</p>

<p>The purser came up to inquire about my ticket, and greeted me
with a grin.</p>

<p>"Ye’re acquaint with Mr Gresson, then?" said the captain. "Weel,
we’re a cheery wee ship’s company, and that’s the great thing
on this kind o’ job."</p>

<p>I made but a poor supper, for the wind had risen to half a gale,
and I saw hours of wretchedness approaching. The trouble with
me is that I cannot be honestly sick and get it over. Queasiness
and headache beset me and there is no refuge but bed. I turned
into my bunk, leaving the captain and the mate smoking shag not
six feet from my head, and fell into a restless sleep. When I
woke the place was empty, and smelt vilely of stale tobacco and
cheese. My throbbing brows made sleep impossible, and I tried
to ease them by staggering upon deck. I saw a clear windy sky,
with every star as bright as a live coal, and a heaving waste
of dark waters running to ink-black hills. Then a douche of spray
caught me and sent me down the companion to my bunk again, where
I lay for hours trying to make a plan of campaign.</p>

<p>I argued that if Amos had wanted me to have a passport he would
have provided one, so I needn’t bother my head about that. But
it was my business to keep alongside Gresson, and if the boat
stayed a week in some port and he went off ashore, I must follow
him. Having no passport I would have to be always dodging trouble,
which would handicap my movements and in all likelihood make me
more conspicuous than I wanted. I guessed that Amos had denied
me the passport for the very reason that he wanted Gresson to
think me harmless. The area of danger would, therefore, be the
passport country, somewhere north of Fort William.</p>

<p>But to follow Gresson I must run risks and enter that country.
His suspicions, if he had any, would be lulled if I left the boat
at Oban, but it was up to me to follow overland to the north and
hit the place where the <em>Tobermory</em> made a long stay. The
confounded tub had no plans; she wandered about the West Highlands
looking for sheep and things; and the captain himself could give
me no time-table of her voyage. It was incredible that Gresson
should take all this trouble if he did not know that at some place—and
the right place—he would have time to get a spell ashore. But
I could scarcely ask Gresson for that information, though I determined
to cast a wary fly over him. I knew roughly the <em>Tobermory’s</em>
course—through the Sound of Islay to Colonsay; then up the east
side of Mull to Oban; then through the Sound of Mull to the islands
with names like cocktails, Rum and Eigg and Coll; then to Skye;
and then for the Outer Hebrides. I thought the last would be the
place, and it seemed madness to leave the boat, for the Lord knew
how I should get across the Minch. This consideration upset all
my plans again, and I fell into a troubled sleep without coming
to any conclusion.</p>

<p>Morning found us nosing between Jura and Islay, and about midday
we touched at a little port, where we unloaded some cargo and
took on a couple of shepherds who were going to Colonsay. The
mellow afternoon and the good smell of salt and heather got rid
of the dregs of my queasiness, and I spent a profitable hour on
the pier-head with a guide-book called <em>Baddely’s Scotland</em>,
and one of Bartholomew’s maps. I was beginning to think that Amos
might be able to tell me something, for a talk with the captain
had suggested that the <em>Tobermory</em> would not dally long
in the neighbourhood of Rum and Eigg. The big droving season was
scarcely on yet, and sheep for the Oban market would be lifted
on the return journey. In that case Skye was the first place to
watch, and if I could get wind of any big cargo waiting there
I would be able to make a plan. Amos was somewhere near the Kyle,
and that was across the narrows from Skye. Looking at the map,
it seemed to me that, in spite of being passportless, I might
be able somehow to make my way up through Morvern and Arisaig
to the latitude of Skye. The difficulty would be to get across
the strip of sea, but there must be boats to beg, borrow or steal.</p>

<p>I was poring over Baddely when Gresson sat down beside me. He
was in a good temper, and disposed to talk, and to my surprise
his talk was all about the beauties of the countryside. There
was a kind of apple-green light over everything; the steep heather
hills cut into the sky like purple amethysts, while beyond the
straits the western ocean stretched its pale molten gold to the
sunset. Gresson waxed lyrical over the scene. "This just about
puts me right inside, Mr Brand. I’ve got to get away from that
little old town pretty frequent or I begin to moult like a canary.
A man feels a man when he gets to a place that smells as good
as this. Why in hell do we ever get messed up in those stone and
lime cages? I reckon some day I’ll pull my freight for a clean
location and settle down there and make little poems. This place
would about content me. And there’s a spot out in California in
the Coast ranges that I’ve been keeping my eye on." The odd thing
was that I believe he meant it. His ugly face was lit up with
a serious delight.</p>

<p>He told me he had taken this voyage before, so I got out <em>Baddely</em>
and asked for advice. "I can’t spend too much time on holidaying,"
I told him, "and I want to see all the beauty spots. But the best
of them seem to be in the area that this fool British Government
won’t let you into without a passport. I suppose I shall have
to leave you at Oban."</p>

<p>"Too bad," he said sympathetically. "Well, they tell me there’s
some pretty sights round Oban." And he thumbed the guide-book
and began to read about Glencoe.</p>

<p>I said that was not my purpose, and pitched him a yarn about
Prince Charlie and how my mother’s great-grandfather had played
some kind of part in that show. I told him I wanted to see the
place where the Prince landed and where he left for France. "So
far as I can make out that won’t take me into the passport country,
but I’ll have to do a bit of footslogging. Well, I’m used to padding
the hoof. I must get the captain to put me off in Morvern, and
then I can foot it round the top of Lochiel and get back to Oban
through Appin. How’s that for a holiday trek?"</p>

<p>He gave the scheme his approval. "But if it was me, Mr Brand,
I would have a shot at puzzling your gallant policemen. You and
I don’t take much stock in Governments and their two-cent laws,
and it would be a good game to see just how far you could get
into the forbidden land. A man like you could put up a good bluff
on those hayseeds. I don’t mind having a bet...."</p>

<p>"No," I said. "I’m out for a rest, and not for sport. If there
was anything to be gained I’d undertake to bluff my way to the
Orkney Islands. But it’s a wearing job and I’ve better things
to think about."</p>

<p>"So? Well, enjoy yourself your own way. I’ll be sorry when you
leave us, for I owe you something for that rough-house, and beside
there’s darned little company in the old moss-back captain."</p>

<p>That evening Gresson and I swopped yarns after supper to the
accompaniment of the "Ma Goad!" and "Is’t possible?" of captain
and mate. I went to bed after a glass or two of weak grog, and
made up for the last night’s vigil by falling sound asleep. I
had very little kit with me, beyond what I stood up in and could
carry in my waterproof pockets, but on Amos’s advice I had brought
my little nickel-plated revolver. This lived by day in my hip
pocket, but at night I put it behind my pillow. But when I woke
next morning to find us casting anchor in the bay below rough
low hills, which I knew to be the island of Colonsay, I could
find no trace of the revolver. I searched every inch of the bunk
and only shook out feathers from the mouldy ticking. I remembered
perfectly putting the thing behind my head before I went to sleep,
and now it had vanished utterly. Of course I could not advertise
my loss, and I didn’t greatly mind it, for this was not a job
where I could do much shooting. But it made me think a good deal
about Mr Gresson. He simply could not suspect me; if he had bagged
my gun, as I was pretty certain he had, it must be because he
wanted it for himself and not that he might disarm me. Every way
I argued it I reached the same conclusion. In Gresson’s eyes I
must seem as harmless as a child.</p>

<p>We spent the better part of a day at Colonsay, and Gresson, so
far as his duties allowed, stuck to me like a limpet. Before I
went ashore I wrote out a telegram for Amos. I devoted a hectic
hour to the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>, but I could not compose
any kind of intelligible message with reference to its text. We
had all the same edition—the one in the <em>Golden Treasury</em>
series—so I could have made up a sort of cipher by referring to
lines and pages, but that would have taken up a dozen telegraph
forms and seemed to me too elaborate for the purpose. So I sent
this message:</p>

<p><em>Ochterlony, Post Office, Kyle, I hope to spend part of holiday
near you and to see you if boat’s programme permits. Are any good
cargoes waiting in your neighbourhood? Reply Post Office, Oban.</em></p>

<p>It was highly important that Gresson should not see this, but
it was the deuce of a business to shake him off. I went for a
walk in the afternoon along the shore and passed the telegraph
office, but the confounded fellow was with me all the time. My
only chance was just before we sailed, when he had to go on board
to check some cargo. As the telegraph office stood full in view
of the ship’s deck I did not go near it. But in the back end of
the clachan I found the schoolmaster, and got him to promise to
send the wire. I also bought off him a couple of well-worn sevenpenny
novels.</p>

<p>The result was that I delayed our departure for ten minutes and
when I came on board faced a wrathful Gresson. "Where the hell
have you been?" he asked. "The weather’s blowing up dirty and
the old man’s mad to get off. Didn’t you get your legs stretched
enough this afternoon?"</p>

<p>I explained humbly that I had been to the schoolmaster to get
something to read, and produced my dingy red volumes. At that
his brow cleared. I could see that his suspicions were set at
rest.</p>

<p>We left Colonsay about six in the evening with the sky behind
us banking for a storm, and the hills of Jura to starboard an
angry purple. Colonsay was too low an island to be any kind of
breakwater against a western gale, so the weather was bad from
the start. Our course was north by east, and when we had passed
the butt-end of the island we nosed about in the trough of big
seas, shipping tons of water and rolling like a buffalo. I know
as much about boats as about Egyptian hieroglyphics, but even
my landsman’s eyes could tell that we were in for a rough night.
I was determined not to get queasy again, but when I went below
the smell of tripe and onions promised to be my undoing; so I
dined off a slab of chocolate and a cabin biscuit, put on my waterproof,
and resolved to stick it out on deck.</p>

<p>I took up position near the bows, where I was out of reach of
the oily steamer smells. It was as fresh as the top of a mountain,
but mighty cold and wet, for a gusty drizzle had set in, and I
got the spindrift of the big waves. There I balanced myself, as
we lurched into the twilight, hanging on with one hand to a rope
which descended from the stumpy mast. I noticed that there was
only an indifferent rail between me and the edge, but that interested
me and helped to keep off sickness. I swung to the movement of
the vessel, and though I was mortally cold it was rather pleasant
than otherwise. My notion was to get the nausea whipped out of
me by the weather, and, when I was properly tired, to go down
and turn in.</p>

<p>I stood there till the dark had fallen. By that time I was an
automaton, the way a man gets on sentry-go, and I could have easily
hung on till morning. My thoughts ranged about the earth, beginning
with the business I had set out on, and presently—by way of recollections
of Blenkiron and Peter—reaching the German forest where, in the
Christmas of 1915, I had been nearly done in by fever and old
Stumm. I remembered the bitter cold of that wild race, and the
way the snow seemed to burn like fire when I stumbled and got
my face into it. I reflected that sea-sickness was kitten’s play
to a good bout of malaria.</p>

<p>The weather was growing worse, and I was getting more than spindrift
from the seas. I hooked my arm round the rope, for my fingers
were numbing. Then I fell to dreaming again, principally about
Fosse Manor and Mary Lamington. This so ravished me that I was
as good as asleep. I was trying to reconstruct the picture as
I had last seen her at Biggleswick station....</p>

<p>A heavy body collided with me and shook my arm from the rope.
I slithered across the yard of deck, engulfed in a whirl of water.
One foot caught a stanchion of the rail, and it gave with me,
so that for an instant I was more than half overboard. But my
fingers clawed wildly and caught in the links of what must have
been the anchor chain. They held, though a ton’s weight seemed
to be tugging at my feet.... Then the old tub rolled back, the
waters slipped off, and I was sprawling on a wet deck with no
breath in me and a gallon of brine in my windpipe.</p>

<p>I heard a voice cry out sharply, and a hand helped me to my feet.
It was Gresson, and he seemed excited.</p>

<p>"God, Mr Brand, that was a close call! I was coming up to find
you, when this damned ship took to lying on her side. I guess
I must have cannoned into you, and I was calling myself bad names
when I saw you rolling into the Atlantic. If I hadn’t got a grip
on the rope I would have been down beside you. Say, you’re not
hurt? I reckon you’d better come below and get a glass of rum
under your belt. You’re about as wet as mother’s dish-clouts."</p>

<p>There’s one advantage about campaigning. You take your luck when
it comes and don’t worry about what might have been. I didn’t
think any more of the business, except that it had cured me of
wanting to be sea-sick. I went down to the reeking cabin without
one qualm in my stomach, and ate a good meal of welsh-rabbit and
bottled Bass, with a tot of rum to follow up with. Then I shed
my wet garments, and slept in my bunk till we anchored off a village
in Mull in a clear blue morning.</p>

<p>It took us four days to crawl up that coast and make Oban, for
we seemed to be a floating general store for every hamlet in those
parts. Gresson made himself very pleasant, as if he wanted to
atone for nearly doing me in. We played some poker, and I read
the little books I had got in Colonsay, and then rigged up a fishing-line,
and caught saithe and lythe and an occasional big haddock. But
I found the time pass slowly, and I was glad that about noon one
day we came into a bay blocked with islands and saw a clean little
town sitting on the hills and the smoke of a railway engine.</p>

<p>I went ashore and purchased a better brand of hat in a tweed
store. Then I made a bee-line for the post office, and asked for
telegrams. One was given to me, and as I opened it I saw Gresson
at my elbow.</p>

<p>It ran thus:</p>

<p><em>Brand, Post office, Oban. Page</em> 117, <em>paragraph</em>
3. <em>Ochterlony.</em></p>

<p>I passed it to Gresson with a rueful face.</p>

<p>"There’s a piece of foolishness," I said. "I’ve got a cousin
who’s a Presbyterian minister up in Ross-shire, and before I knew
about this passport humbug I wrote to him and offered to pay him
a visit. I told him to wire me here if it was convenient, and
the old idiot has sent me the wrong telegram. This was likely
as not meant for some other brother parson, who’s got my message
instead."</p>

<p>"What’s the guy’s name?" Gresson asked curiously, peering at
the signature.</p>

<p>"Ochterlony. David Ochterlony. He’s a great swell at writing
books, but he’s no earthly use at handling the telegraph. However,
it don’t signify, seeing I’m not going near him." I crumpled up
the pink form and tossed it on the floor. Gresson and I walked
to the <em>Tobermory</em> together.</p>

<p>That afternoon, when I got a chance, I had out my <em>Pilgrim’s
Progress</em>. Page 117, paragraph 3, read:</p>

<p>"<em>Then I saw in my dream, that a little off the road, over
against the Silver-mine, stood Demas (gentlemanlike) to call to
passengers to come and see: who said to Christian and his fellow,
Ho, turn aside hither and I will show you a thing.</em></p>

<p>At tea I led the talk to my own past life. I yarned about my
experiences as a mining engineer, and said I could never get out
of the trick of looking at country with the eye of the prospector.
"For instance," I said, "if this had been Rhodesia, I would have
said there was a good chance of copper in these little kopjes
above the town. They’re not unlike the hills round the Messina
mine." I told the captain that after the war I was thinking of
turning my attention to the West Highlands and looking out for
minerals.</p>

<p>"Ye’ll make nothing of it," said the captain. "The costs are
ower big, even if ye found the minerals, for ye’d have to import
a’ your labour. The West Hielandman is no fond o’ hard work. Ye
ken the psalm o’ the crofter?</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
O that the peats would cut themselves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish chump on the shore,<br/>
And that I in my bed might lie<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth for ever more!

</p>
</div>
<p>"Has it ever been tried?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Often. There’s marble and slate quarries, and there was word
o’ coal in Benbecula. And there’s the iron mines at Ranna."</p>

<p>"Where’s that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Up forenent Skye. We call in there, and generally bide a bit.
There’s a heap of cargo for Ranna, and we usually get a good load
back. But as I tell ye, there’s few Hielanders working there.
Mostly Irish and lads frae Fife and Falkirk way."</p>

<p>I didn’t pursue the subject, for I had found Demas’s silver-mine.
If the <em>Tobermory</em> lay at Ranna for a week, Gresson would
have time to do his own private business. Ranna would not be the
spot, for the island was bare to the world in the middle of a
much-frequented channel. But Skye was just across the way, and
when I looked in my map at its big, wandering peninsulas I concluded
that my guess had been right, and that Skye was the place to make
for.</p>

<p>That night I sat on deck with Gresson, and in a wonderful starry
silence we watched the lights die out of the houses in the town,
and talked of a thousand things. I noticed—what I had had a hint
of before—that my companion was no common man. There were moments
when he forgot himself and talked like an educated gentleman:
then he would remember, and relapse into the lingo of Leadville,
Colorado. In my character of the ingenuous inquirer I set him
posers about politics and economics, the kind of thing I might
have been supposed to pick up from unintelligent browsing among
little books. Generally he answered with some slangy catchword,
but occasionally he was interested beyond his discretion, and
treated me to a harangue like an equal. I discovered another thing,
that he had a craze for poetry, and a capacious memory for it.
I forgot how we drifted into the subject, but I remember he quoted
some queer haunting stuff which he said was Swinburne, and verses
by people I had heard of from Letchford at Biggleswick. Then he
saw by my silence that he had gone too far, and fell back into
the jargon of the West. He wanted to know about my plans, and
we went down into the cabin and had a look at the map. I explained
my route, up Morvern and round the head of Lochiel, and back to
Oban by the east side of Loch Linnhe.</p>

<p>"Got you," he said. "You’ve a hell of a walk before you. That
bug never bit me, and I guess I’m not envying you any. And after
that, Mr Brand?"</p>

<p>"Back to Glasgow to do some work for the cause," I said lightly.</p>

<p>"Just so," he said with a grin. "It’s a great life if you don’t
weaken."</p>

<p>We steamed out of the bay next morning at dawn, and about nine
o’clock I got on shore at a little place called Lochaline. My
kit was all on my person, and my waterproof’s pockets were stuffed
with chocolates and biscuits I had bought in Oban. The captain
was discouraging. "Ye’ll get your bellyful o’ Hieland hills, Mr
Brand, afore ye win round the loch head. Ye’ll be wishin’ yerself
back on the <em>Tobermory</em>." But Gresson speeded me joyfully
on my way, and said he wished he were coming with me. He even
accompanied me the first hundred yards, and waved his hat after
me till I was round the turn of the road.</p>

<p>The first stage in that journey was pure delight. I was thankful
to be rid of the infernal boat, and the hot summer scents coming
down the glen were comforting after the cold, salt smell of the
sea. The road lay up the side of a small bay, at the top of which
a big white house stood among gardens. Presently I had left the
coast and was in a glen where a brown salmon-river swirled through
acres of bog-myrtle. It had its source in a loch, from which the
mountain rose steeply—a place so glassy in that August forenoon
that every scar and wrinkle of the hillside were faithfully reflected.
After that I crossed a low pass to the head of another sea-lock,
and, following the map, struck over the shoulder of a great hill
and ate my luncheon far up on its side, with a wonderful vista
of wood and water below me.</p>

<p>All that morning I was very happy, not thinking about Gresson
or Ivery, but getting my mind clear in those wide spaces, and
my lungs filled with the brisk hill air. But I noticed one curious
thing. On my last visit to Scotland, when I covered more moorland
miles a day than any man since Claverhouse, I had been fascinated
by the land, and had pleased myself with plans for settling down
in it. But now, after three years of war and general rocketing,
I felt less drawn to that kind of landscape. I wanted something
more green and peaceful and habitable, and it was to the Cotswolds
that my memory turned with longing.</p>

<p>I puzzled over this till I realised that in all my Cotswold pictures
a figure kept going and coming—a young girl with a cloud of gold
hair and the strong, slim grace of a boy, who had sung "Cherry
Ripe" in a moonlit garden. Up on that hillside I understood very
clearly that I, who had been as careless of women as any monk,
had fallen wildly in love with a child of half my age. I was loath
to admit it, though for weeks the conclusion had been forcing
itself on me. Not that I didn’t revel in my madness, but that
it seemed too hopeless a business, and I had no use for barren
philandering. But, seated on a rock munching chocolate and biscuits,
I faced up to the fact and resolved to trust my luck. After all
we were comrades in a big job, and it was up to me to be man enough
to win her. The thought seemed to brace any courage that was in
me. No task seemed too hard with her approval to gain and her
companionship somewhere at the back of it. I sat for a long time
in a happy dream, remembering all the glimpses I had had of her,
and humming her song to an audience of one black-faced sheep.</p>

<p>On the highroad half a mile below me, I saw a figure on a bicycle
mounting the hill, and then getting off to mop its face at the
summit. I turned my Zeiss glasses on to it, and observed that
it was a country policeman. It caught sight of me, stared for
a bit, tucked its machine into the side of the road, and then
very slowly began to climb the hillside. Once it stopped, waved
its hand and shouted something which I could not hear. I sat finishing
my luncheon, till the features were revealed to me of a fat oldish
man, blowing like a grampus, his cap well on the back of a bald
head, and his trousers tied about the shins with string.</p>

<p>There was a spring beside me and I had out my flask to round
off my meal.</p>

<p>"Have a drink," I said.</p>

<p>His eye brightened, and a smile overran his moist face.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. It will be very warrm coming up the brae."</p>

<p>"You oughtn’t to," I said. "You really oughtn’t, you know. Scorching
up hills and then doubling up a mountain are not good for your
time of life."</p>

<p>He raised the cap of my flask in solemn salutation. "Your very
good health." Then he smacked his lips, and had several cupfuls
of water from the spring.</p>

<p>"You will haf come from Achranich way, maybe?" he said in his
soft sing-song, having at last found his breath.</p>

<p>"Just so. Fine weather for the birds, if there was anybody to
shoot them."</p>

<p>"Ah, no. There will be few shots fired today, for there are no
gentlemen left in Morvern. But I wass asking you, if you come
from Achranich, if you haf seen anybody on the road."</p>

<p>From his pocket he extricated a brown envelope and a bulky telegraph
form. "Will you read it, sir, for I haf forgot my spectacles?"</p>

<p>It contained a description of one Brand, a South African and
a suspected character, whom the police were warned to stop and
return to Oban. The description wasn’t bad, but it lacked any
one good distinctive detail. Clearly the policeman took me for
an innocent pedestrian, probably the guest of some moorland shooting-box,
with my brown face and rough tweeds and hobnailed shoes.</p>

<p>I frowned and puzzled a little. "I did see a fellow about three
miles back on the hillside. There’s a public-house just where
the burn comes in, and I think he was making for it. Maybe that
was your man. This wire says ‘South African’; and now I remember
the fellow had the look of a colonial."</p>

<p>The policeman sighed. "No doubt it will be the man. Perhaps he
will haf a pistol and will shoot."</p>

<p>"Not him," I laughed. "He looked a mangy sort of chap, and he’ll
be scared out of his senses at the sight of you. But take my advice
and get somebody with you before you tackle him. You’re always
the better of a witness."</p>

<p>"That is so," he said, brightening. "Ach, these are the bad times!
in old days there wass nothing to do but watch the doors at the
flower-shows and keep the yachts from poaching the sea-trout.
But now it is spies, spies, and ‘Donald, get out of your bed,
and go off twenty mile to find a German.’ I wass wishing the war
wass by, and the Germans all dead."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" I cried, and on the strength of it gave him another
dram.</p>

<p>I accompanied him to the road, and saw him mount his bicycle
and zig-zag like a snipe down the hill towards Achranich. Then
I set off briskly northward. It was clear that the faster I moved
the better.</p>

<p>As I went I paid disgusted tribute to the efficiency of the Scottish
police. I wondered how on earth they had marked me down. Perhaps
it was the Glasgow meeting, or perhaps my association with Ivery
at Biggleswick. Anyhow there was somebody somewhere mighty quick
at compiling a <em>dossier</em>. Unless I wanted to be bundled
back to Oban I must make good speed to the Arisaig coast.</p>

<p>Presently the road fell to a gleaming sea-loch which lay like
the blue blade of a sword among the purple of the hills. At the
head there was a tiny clachan, nestled among birches and rowans,
where a tawny burn wound to the sea. When I entered the place
it was about four o’clock in the afternoon, and peace lay on it
like a garment. In the wide, sunny street there was no sign of
life, and no sound except of hens clucking and of bees busy among
the roses. There was a little grey box of a kirk, and close to
the bridge a thatched cottage which bore the sign of a post and
telegraph office.</p>

<p>For the past hour I had been considering that I had better prepare
for mishaps. If the police of these parts had been warned they
might prove too much for me, and Gresson would be allowed to make
his journey unmatched. The only thing to do was to send a wire
to Amos and leave the matter in his hands. Whether that was possible
or not depended upon this remote postal authority.</p>

<p>I entered the little shop, and passed from bright sunshine to
a twilight smelling of paraffin and black-striped peppermint balls.
An old woman with a mutch sat in an arm-chair behind the counter.
She looked up at me over her spectacles and smiled, and I took
to her on the instant. She had the kind of old wise face that
God loves.</p>

<p>Beside her I noticed a little pile of books, one of which was
a Bible. Open on her lap was a paper, the <em>United Free Church
Monthly</em>. I noticed these details greedily, for I had to make
up my mind on the part to play.</p>

<p>"It’s a warm day, mistress," I said, my voice falling into the
broad Lowland speech, for I had an instinct that she was not of
the Highlands.</p>

<p>She laid aside her paper. "It is that, sir. It is grand weather
for the hairst, but here that’s no till the hinner end o’ September,
and at the best it’s a bit scart o’ aits."</p>

<p>"Ay. It’s a different thing down Annandale way," I said.</p>

<p>Her face lit up. "Are ye from Dumfries, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not just from Dumfries, but I know the Borders fine."</p>

<p>"Ye’ll no beat them," she cried. "Not that this is no a guid
place and I’ve muckle to be thankfu’ for since John Sanderson—that
was ma man—brought me here forty-seeven year syne come Martinmas.
But the aulder I get the mair I think o’ the bit whaur I was born.
It was twae miles from Wamphray on the Lockerbie road, but they
tell me the place is noo just a rickle o’ stanes."</p>

<p>"I was wondering, mistress, if I could get a cup of tea in the
village."</p>

<p>"Ye’ll hae a cup wi’ me," she said. "It’s no often we see onybody
frae the Borders hereaways. The kettle’s just on the boil."</p>

<p>She gave me tea and scones and butter, and black-currant jam,
and treacle biscuits that melted in the mouth. And as we ate we
talked of many things—chiefly of the war and of the wickedness
of the world.</p>

<p>"There’s nae lads left here," she said. "They a’ joined the Camerons,
and the feck o’ them fell at an awfu’ place called Lowse. John
and me never had no boys, jist the one lassie that’s married on
Donald Frew, the Strontian carrier. I used to vex mysel’ about
it, but now I thank the Lord that in His mercy He spared me sorrow.
But I wad hae liked to have had one laddie fechtin’ for his country.
I whiles wish I was a Catholic and could pit up prayers for the
sodgers that are deid. It maun be a great consolation."</p>

<p>I whipped out the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em> from my pocket.
"That is the grand book for a time like this."</p>

<p>"Fine I ken it," she said. "I got it for a prize in the Sabbath
School when I was a lassie."</p>

<p>I turned the pages. I read out a passage or two, and then I seemed
struck with a sudden memory.</p>

<p>"This is a telegraph office, mistress. Could I trouble you to
send a telegram? You see I’ve a cousin that’s a minister in Ross-shire
at the Kyle, and him and me are great correspondents. He was writing
about something in the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em> and I think
I’ll send him a telegram in answer."</p>

<p>"A letter would be cheaper," she said.</p>

<p>"Ay, but I’m on holiday and I’ve no time for writing."</p>

<p>She gave me a form, and I wrote:</p>

<p><em>Ochterlony. Post Office, Kyle.—Demas will be at his mine
within the week. Strive with him, lest I faint by the way.</em></p>

<p>"Ye’re unco lavish wi’ the words, sir," was her only comment.</p>

<p>We parted with regret, and there was nearly a row when I tried
to pay for the tea. I was bidden remember her to one David Tudhole,
farmer in Nether Mirecleuch, the next time I passed by Wamphray.</p>

<p>The village was as quiet when I left it as when I had entered.
I took my way up the hill with an easier mind, for I had got off
the telegram, and I hoped I had covered my tracks. My friend the
postmistress would, if questioned, be unlikely to recognise any
South African suspect in the frank and homely traveller who had
spoken with her of Annandale and the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>.</p>

<p>The soft mulberry gloaming of the west coast was beginning to
fall on the hills. I hoped to put in a dozen miles before dark
to the next village on the map, where I might find quarters. But
ere I had gone far I heard the sound of a motor behind me, and
a car slipped past bearing three men. The driver favoured me with
a sharp glance, and clapped on the brakes. I noted that the two
men in the tonneau were carrying sporting rifles.</p>

<p>"Hi, you, sir," he cried. "Come here." The two rifle-bearers—solemn
gillies—brought their weapons to attention.</p>

<p>"By God," he said, "it’s the man. What’s your name? Keep him
covered, Angus."</p>

<p>The gillies duly covered me, and I did not like the look of their
wavering barrels. They were obviously as surprised as myself.</p>

<p>I had about half a second to make my plans. I advanced with a
very stiff air, and asked him what the devil he meant. No Lowland
Scots for me now. My tone was that of an adjutant of a Guards’
battalion.</p>

<p>My inquisitor was a tall man in an ulster, with a green felt
hat on his small head. He had a lean, well-bred face, and very
choleric blue eyes. I set him down as a soldier, retired, Highland
regiment or cavalry, old style.</p>

<p>He produced a telegraph form, like the policeman.</p>

<p>"Middle height—strongly built—grey tweeds—brown hat—speaks with
a colonial accent—much sunburnt. What’s your name, sir?"</p>

<p>I did not reply in a colonial accent, but with the <em>hauteur</em>
of the British officer when stopped by a French sentry. I asked
him again what the devil he had to do with my business. This made
him angry and he began to stammer.</p>

<p>"I’ll teach you what I have to do with it. I’m a deputy-lieutenant
of this county, and I have Admiralty instructions to watch the
coast. Damn it, sir, I’ve a wire here from the Chief Constable
describing you. You’re Brand, a very dangerous fellow, and we
want to know what the devil you’re doing here."</p>

<p>As I looked at his wrathful eye and lean head, which could not
have held much brains, I saw that I must change my tone. If I
irritated him he would get nasty and refuse to listen and hang
me up for hours. So my voice became respectful.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but I’ve not been accustomed to be pulled
up suddenly, and asked for my credentials. My name is Blaikie,
Captain Robert Blaikie, of the Scots Fusiliers. I’m home on three
weeks’ leave, to get a little peace after Hooge. We were only
hauled out five days ago." I hoped my old friend in the shell-shock
hospital at Isham would pardon my borrowing his identity.</p>

<p>The man looked puzzled. "How the devil am I to be satisfied about
that? Have you any papers to prove it?"</p>

<p>"Why, no. I don’t carry passports about with me on a walking
tour. But you can wire to the depot, or to my London address."</p>

<p>He pulled at his yellow moustache. "I’m hanged if I know what
to do. I want to get home for dinner. I tell you what, sir, I’ll
take you on with me and put you up for the night. My boy’s at
home, convalescing, and if he says you’re <em>pukka</em> I’ll
ask your pardon and give you a dashed good bottle of port. I’ll
trust him and I warn you he’s a keen hand."</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but consent, and I got in beside him
with an uneasy conscience. Supposing the son knew the real Blaikie!
I asked the name of the boy’s battalion, and was told the 10th
Seaforths. That wasn’t pleasant hearing, for they had been brigaded
with us on the Somme. But Colonel Broadbury—for he told me his
name—volunteered another piece of news which set my mind at rest.
The boy was not yet twenty, and had only been out seven months.
At Arras he had got a bit of shrapnel in his thigh, which had
played the deuce with the sciatic nerve, and he was still on crutches.</p>

<p>We spun over ridges of moorland, always keeping northward, and
brought up at a pleasant white-washed house close to the sea.
Colonel Broadbury ushered me into a hall where a small fire of
peats was burning, and on a couch beside it lay a slim, pale-faced
young man. He had dropped his policeman’s manner, and behaved
like a gentleman. "Ted," he said, "I’ve brought a friend home
for the night. I went out to look for a suspect and found a British
officer. This is Captain Blaikie, of the Scots Fusiliers."</p>

<p>The boy looked at me pleasantly. "I’m very glad to meet you,
sir. You’ll excuse me not getting up, but I’ve got a game leg."
He was the copy of his father in features, but dark and sallow
where the other was blond. He had just the same narrow head, and
stubborn mouth, and honest, quick-tempered eyes. It is the type
that makes dashing regimental officers, and earns <em>V.C.</em>s,
and gets done in wholesale. I was never that kind. I belonged
to the school of the cunning cowards.</p>

<p>In the half-hour before dinner the last wisp of suspicion fled
from my host’s mind. For Ted Broadbury and I were immediately
deep in "shop". I had met most of his senior officers, and I knew
all about their doings at Arras, for his brigade had been across
the river on my left. We fought the great fight over again, and
yarned about technicalities and slanged the Staff in the way young
officers have, the father throwing in questions that showed how
mighty proud he was of his son. I had a bath before dinner, and
as he led me to the bathroom he apologised very handsomely for
his bad manners. "Your coming’s been a godsend for Ted. He was
moping a bit in this place. And, though I say it that shouldn’t,
he’s a dashed good boy."</p>

<p>I had my promised bottle of port, and after dinner I took on
the father at billiards. Then we settled in the smoking-room,
and I laid myself out to entertain the pair. The result was that
they would have me stay a week, but I spoke of the shortness of
my leave, and said I must get on to the railway and then back
to Fort William for my luggage.</p>

<p>So I spent that night between clean sheets, and ate a Christian
breakfast, and was given my host’s car to set me a bit on the
road. I dismissed it after half a dozen miles, and, following
the map, struck over the hills to the west. About midday I topped
a ridge, and beheld the Sound of Sleat shining beneath me. There
were other things in the landscape. In the valley on the right
a long goods train was crawling on the Mallaig railway. And across
the strip of sea, like some fortress of the old gods, rose the
dark bastions and turrets of the hills of Skye.</p>
