A MAN had two Gamecocks in his poultry-yard.  One day by chance
he found a tame Partridge for sale.  He purchased it and brought
it home to be reared with his Gamecocks.  When the Partridge was
put into the poultry-yard, they struck at it and followed it
about, so that the Partridge became grievously troubled and
supposed that he was thus evilly treated because he was a
stranger.  Not long afterwards he saw the Cocks fighting together
and not separating before one had well beaten the other.  He then
said to himself, "I shall no longer distress myself at being
struck at by these Gamecocks, when I see that they cannot even
refrain from quarreling with each other."
