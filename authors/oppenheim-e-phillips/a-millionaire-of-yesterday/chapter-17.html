"Ernestine," he said gravely, "I am going to  speak to you about
your father!"
<P>
She looked up at him in swift surprise.
<P>
"Is it necessary?"
<P>
"I think so," he answered.  "You won't like what I'm going to tell
you!  You'll think you've been badly treated.  So you have!  I
pledged my word, in a weak hour, with the others.  To-day I'm going
to break it.  I think it best."
<P>
"Well?"
<P>
"You've been deceived!  You were told always that your father had
died in prison.  He didn't."
<P>
"What!
<P>
Her sharp cry rang out strangely into the little room.  Already he
could see signs of the coming storm, and the task which lay before
him seemed more hateful than ever.
<P>
"Listen," he said.  "I must tell you some things which you know in
order to explain others which you do not know.  Your father was a
younger son born of extravagant parents, virtually penniless and
without the least capacity for earning money.  I don't blame him
 - who could?  I couldn't earn money myself.  If I hadn't got it I
daresay that I should go to the bad as he did."
<P>
The girl's lips tightened, and she drew a little breath through her
teeth.  Davenant hesitated.
<P>
"You know all about that company affair.  Of course they made your
father the butt of the whole thing, although he was little more
than a tool.  He was sent to prison for seven years.  You were only
a child then and your mother was dead.  Well, when the seven years
were up, your relations and mine too, Ernestine, concocted what I
have always considered an ill-begotten and a miserably selfish plot.
Your father, unfortunately, yielded to them, for your sake.  You
were told that he had died in prison.  He did not.  He lived through
his seven years there, and when he came out did so in another name
and went abroad on the morning of the day of his liberation."
<P>
"Good God!" she cried.  "And now!"
<P>
"He is dead," Davenant answered hastily, "but only just lately.
Wait a minute.  You are going to be furiously angry.  I know it,
and I don't blame you.  Only listen for a moment.  The scheme was
hatched up between my father and your two uncles.  I have always
hated it and always protested against it.  Remember that and be
fair to me.  This is how they reasoned.  Your father's health,
they said, was ruined, and if he lives the seven years what is
there left for him when he comes out?  He was a man, as you know,
of aristocratic and fastidious tastes.  He would have the best of
everything - society, clubs, sport.  Now all these were barred
against him.  If he had reappeared he could not have shown his face
in Pall Mall, or on the racecourses, and every moment of his life
would be full of humiliations and bitterness.  Virtually then, for
such a man as he was, life in England was over.  Then there was you.
You were a pretty child and the Earl had no children.  If your
father was dead the story would be forgotten, you would marry
brilliantly and an ugly page in the family history would be blotted
out.  That was how they looked at it - it was how they put it to
your father."
<P>
"He consented?"
<P>
"Yes, he consented!  He saw the wisdom of it for your sake, for the
sake of the family, even for his own sake.  The Earl settled an
income upon him and he left England secretly on the morning of his
release.  We had the news of his death only a week or two ago."
<P>
She stood up, her eyes blazing, her hands clenched together.
<P>
"I thank God," she said "that I have found the courage to break
away from those people and take a little of my life into my own
hands.  You can tell them this if you will, Cecil, - my uncle Lord
Davenant, your mother, and whoever had a say in this miserable
affair.  Tell them from me that I know the truth and that they are
a pack of cowardly, unnatural old women.  Tell them that so long as
I live It will never willingly speak to one of them again.
<P>
"I was afraid you'd take it like that," he remarked dolefully.
<P>
"Take it like that!" she repeated in fierce scorn.  "How else could
a woman hear such news?  How else do you suppose she could feel to
be told that she had been hoodwinked, and kept from her duty and a
man's heart very likely broken, to save the respectability of a
worn-out old family.  Oh, how could they have dared to do it?  How
could they have dared to do it?"
<P>
"It was a beastly mistake," he admitted.
<P>
A whirlwind of scorn seemed to sweep over her.  She could keep still
no longer.  She walked up and down the little room.  Her hands were
clenched, her eyes flashing.
<P>
"To tell me that he was dead - to let him live out the rest of his
poor life in exile and alone!  Did they think that I didn't care?
Cecil," she exclaimed, suddenly turning and facing him, "I always
loved my father!  You may think that I was too young to remember
him - I wasn't, I loved him always.  When I grew up and they told
me of his disgrace I was bitterly sorry, for I loved his memory
 - but it made no difference.  And all the time it was a weak, silly
lie!  They let him come out, poor father, without a friend to speak
to him and they hustled him out of the country.  And I, whose place
was there with him, never knew!"
<P>
"You were only a child, Ernestine.  It was twelve years ago."
<P>
"Child!  I may have been only a child, but I should have been old
enough to know where my place was.  Thank God I have done with these
people and their disgusting shibboleth of respectability."
<P>
"You are a little violent," he remarked.
<P>
"Pshaw!" She flashed a look of scorn upon him.  "You don't
understand!  How should you, you are of their kidney - you're only
half a man.  Thank God that my mother was of the people!  I'd have
died to have gone smirking through life with a brick for a heart
and milk and water in my veins!  Of all the stupid pieces of
brutality I ever heard of, this is the most callous and the most
heartbreaking."
<P>
"It was a great mistake," he said, "but I believe they did it for
the best."
<P>
She sat down with a little gesture of despair.
<P>
"I really think you'd better go away, Cecil," she said.  "You
exasperate me too horribly.  I shall strike you or throw something
at you soon.  Did it for the best!  What a miserable whine!  Poor
dear old dad, to think that they should have done this thing."
<P>
She buried her face in her handkerchief and sobbed for the second
time since her childhood.  Davenant was wise enough to attempt no
sort of consolation.  He leaned a little forward and hid his own
face with the palm of his hand.  When at last she looked up her
face had cleared and her tone was less bitter.  It would have gone
very hard with the Earl of Eastchester, however, if he had called
to see his niece just then.
<P>
"Well," she said, "I want to know now why, after keeping silent all
this time, you thought it best to tell me the truth this afternoon?"
<P>
"Because," he answered, "you told me that you had just been to see
Scarlett Trent!"
<P>
"And what on earth had that to do with it?"
<P>
"Because Scarlett Trent was with your father when he died.  They
were on an excursion somewhere up in the bush - the very excursion
that laid the foundation of Trent's fortune."
<P>
"Go on," she cried.  "Tell me all that you know! this is wonderful!"
<P>
"Well, I am glad to tell you this at any rate," he said.  "I always
liked your father and I saw him off when he left England, and have
written to him often since.  I believe I was his only correspondent
in this country, except his solicitors.  He had a very adventurous
and, I am afraid, not a very happy time.  He never wrote cheerfully,
and he mortgaged the greater part of his income.  I don't blame him
for anything he did.  A man needs some responsibility, or some one
dependent upon him to keep straight.  To be frank with you, I don't
think he did."
<P>
"Poor dad," she murmured, "of course he didn't!  I know I'd have
gone to the devil as fast as I could if I'd been treated like it!"
<P>
"Well, he drifted about from place to place and at last he got to
the Gold Coast.  Here I half lost sight of him, and his few letters
were more bitter and despairing than ever.  The last I had told me
that he was just off on an expedition into the interior with another
Englishman.  They were to visit a native King and try to obtain from
him certain concessions, including the right to work a wonderful
gold-mine somewhere near the village of Bekwando."
<P>
"Why, the great Bekwando Land Company!" she cried.  "It is the one
Scarlett Trent has just formed a syndicate to work."
<P>
Davenant nodded.
<P>
"Yes.  It was a terrible risk they were running," he said, "for the
people were savage and the climate deadly.  He wrote cheerfully for
him, though.  He had a partner, he said, who was strong and
determined, and they had presents, to get which he had mortgaged the
last penny of his income.  It was a desperate enterprise perhaps,
but it suited him, and he went on to tell me this, Ernestine.  If he
succeeded and he became wealthy, he was returning to England just
for a sight of you.  He was so changed, he said, that no one in the
world would recognise him.  Poor fellow!  It was the last line I
had from him."
<P>
"And you are sure," Ernestine said slowly, "that Scarlett Trent was
his partner?"
<P>
"Absolutely.  Trent's own story clinches the matter.  The prospectus
of the mine quotes the concession as having been granted to him by
the King of Bekwando in the same month as your father wrote to me."
<P>
"And what news," she asked, "have you had since?"
<P>
"Only this letter - I will read it to you - from one of the
missionaries of the Basle Society.  I heard nothing for so long that
I made inquiries, and this is the result."
<P>
Ernestine took it and read it out steadily.
<P>
                                                   "FORTNRENIG.
<P>
"DEAR Sir,-In reply to your letter and inquiry, respecting the
whereabouts of a Mr. Richard Grey, the matter was placed in my
hands by the agent of Messrs. Castle, and I have personally visited
Buckoman, the village at which he was last heard of.  It seems that
in February, 18- he started on an expedition to Bekwando in the
interior with an Englishman by the name of Trent, with a view to
buying land from a native King, or obtaining the concession to work
the valuable gold-mines of that country.  The expedition seems to
have been successful, but Trent returned alone and reported that
his companion had been attacked by bush-fever on the way back and
had died in a few hours.
<P>
"I regret very much having to send you such sad and scanty news in
return for your handsome donation to our funds.  I have made every
inquiry, but cannot trace any personal effects or letter.  Mr. Grey,
I find, was known out here altogether by the nickname of Monty.
<P>
I deeply regret the pain which this letter will doubtless cause you,
and trusting that you may seek and receive consolation where alone
it may be found,
                               "I am,
                                    "Yours most sincerely,
                                                 "Chas.  ADDISON."
<P>
Ernestine read the letter carefully through, and instead of handing
it back to Davenant, put it into her pocket when she rose up.
"Cecil," she said, "I want you to leave me at once!  You may come
back to-morrow at the same time.  I am going to think this out
quietly."
<P>
He took up his hat.  "There is one thing more, Ernestine," he said
slowly.  "Enclosed in the letter from the missionary at Attra was
another and a shorter note, which, in accordance with his request,
I burnt as soon as I read it.  I believe the man was honest when
he told me that for hours he had hesitated whether to send me those
few lines or not.  Eventually he decided to do so, but he appealed
to my honour to destroy the note as soon as I had read it."
<P>
"Well!"
<P>
"He thought it his duty to let me know that there had been rumours
as to how your father met his death.  Trent, it seems, had the
reputation of being a reckless and daring man, and, according to
some agreement which they had, he profited enormously by your
father's death.  There seems to have been no really definite ground
for the rumour except that the body was not found where Trent said
that he had died.  Apart from that, life is held cheap out there,
and although your father was in delicate health, his death under
such conditions could not fail to be suspicious.  I hope I haven't
said too much.  I've tried to put it to you exactly as it was put to me!"
<P>
"Thank you," Ernestine said, "I think I understand."
