<p>When her boy was three years old, Mary had another baby, a girl.
The three years had gone by monotonously.  They might have been an
eternity, they might have been brief as a sleep.  She did not know.
Only, there was always a weight on top of her, something that
pressed down her life.  The only thing that had happened was that
Mr Massy had had an operation.  He was always exceedingly fragile.
His wife had soon learned to attend to him mechanically, as part of
her duty.</p>

<p>But this third year, after the baby girl had been born, Mary felt
oppressed and depressed.  Christmas drew near: the gloomy,
unleavened Christmas of the rectory, where all the days were of the
same dark fabric.  And Mary was afraid.  It was as if the darkness
were coming upon her.</p>

<p>&quot;Edward, I should like to go home for Christmas,&quot; she said, and a
certain terror filled her as she spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;But you can't leave baby,&quot; said her husband, blinking.</p>

<p>&quot;We can all go.&quot;</p>

<p>He thought, and stared in his collective fashion.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you wish to go?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Because I need a change.  A change would do me good, and it would
be good for the milk.&quot;</p>

<p>He heard the will in his wife's voice, and was at a loss.  Her
language was unintelligible to him.  And while she was breeding,
either about to have a child, or nursing, he regarded her as a
special sort of being.</p>

<p>&quot;Wouldn't it hurt baby to take her by the train?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied the mother, &quot;why should it?&quot;</p>

<p>They went.  When they were in the train, it began to snow.  From
the window of his first-class carriage the little clergyman watched
the big flakes sweep by, like a blind drawn across the country.  He
was obsessed by thought of the baby, and afraid of the draughts of
the carriage.</p>

<p>&quot;Sit right in the corner,&quot; he said to his wife, &quot;and hold baby
close back.&quot;</p>

<p>She moved at his bidding, and stared out of the window.  His
eternal presence was like an iron weight on her brain.  But she was
going partially to escape for a few days.</p>

<p>&quot;Sit on the other side, Jack,&quot; said the father.  &quot;It is less
draughty.  Come to this window.&quot;</p>

<p>He watched the boy in anxiety.  But his children were the only
beings in the world who took not the slightest notice of him.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, mother, look!&quot; cried the boy.  &quot;They fly right in my face&quot; - 
he meant the snowflakes.</p>

<p>&quot;Come into this corner,&quot; repeated his father, out of another world.</p>

<p>&quot;He's jumped on this one's back, mother, an' they're riding to the
bottom!&quot; cried the boy, jumping with glee.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell him to come on this side,&quot; the little man bade his wife.</p>

<p>&quot;Jack, kneel on this cushion,&quot; said the mother, putting her white
hand on the place.</p>

<p>The boy slid over in silence to the place she indicated, waited
still for a moment, then almost deliberately, stridently cried:</p>

<p>&quot;Look at all those in the corner, mother, making a heap,&quot; and he
pointed to the cluster of snowflakes with finger pressed
dramatically on the pane, and he turned to his mother a bit
ostentatiously.</p>

<p>&quot;All in a heap!&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He had seen her face, and had her response, and he was somewhat
assured.  Vaguely uneasy, he was reassured if he could win her
attention.</p>

<p>They arrived at the vicarage at half-past two, not having had
lunch.</p>

<p>&quot;How are you, Edward?&quot; said Mr Lindley, trying on his side to be
fatherly.  But he was always in a false position with his son-in-
law, frustrated before him, therefore, as much as possible, he shut
his eyes and ears to him.  The vicar was looking thin and pale and
ill-nourished.  He had gone quite grey.  He was, however, still
haughty; but, since the growing-up of his children, it was a
brittle haughtiness, that might break at any moment and leave the
vicar only an impoverished, pitiable figure.  Mrs Lindley took all
the notice of her daughter, and of the children.  She ignored her
son-in-law.  Miss Louisa was clucking and laughing and rejoicing
over the baby.  Mr Massy stood aside, a bent, persistent little
figure.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh a pretty! - a little pretty! oh a cold little pretty come in a
railway-train!&quot;  Miss Louisa was cooing to the infant, crouching on
the hearthrug opening the white woollen wraps and exposing the
child to the fireglow.</p>

<p>&quot;Mary,&quot; said the little clergyman, &quot;I think it would be better to
give baby a warm bath; she may take a cold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think it is not necessary,&quot; said the mother, coming and closing
her hand judiciously over the rosy feet and hands of the mite.
&quot;She is not chilly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a bit,&quot; cried Miss Louisa.  &quot;She's not caught cold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go and bring her flannels,&quot; said Mr Massy, with one idea.</p>

<p>&quot;I can bath her in the kitchen then,&quot; said Mary, in an altered,
cold tone.</p>

<p>&quot;You can't, the girl is scrubbing there,&quot; said Miss Louisa.
&quot;Besides, she doesn't want a bath at this time of day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She'd better have one,&quot; said Mary, quietly, out of submission.
Miss Louisa's gorge rose, and she was silent.  When the little man
padded down with the flannels on his arm, Mrs Lindley asked:</p>

<p>&quot;Hadn't YOU better take a hot bath, Edward?&quot;</p>

<p>But the sarcasm was lost on the little clergyman.  He was absorbed
in the preparations round the baby.</p>

<p>The room was dull and threadbare, and the snow outside seemed
fairy-like by comparison, so white on the lawn and tufted on the
bushes.  Indoors the heavy pictures hung obscurely on the walls,
everything was dingy with gloom.</p>

<p>Except in the fireglow, where they had laid the bath on the hearth.
Mrs Massy, her black hair always smoothly coiled and queenly,
kneeled by the bath, wearing a rubber apron, and holding the
kicking child.  Her husband stood holding the towels and the
flannels to warm.  Louisa, too cross to share in the joy of the
baby's bath, was laying the table.  The boy was hanging on the
door-knob, wrestling with it to get out.  His father looked round.</p>

<p>&quot;Come away from the door, Jack,&quot; he said, ineffectually.  Jack
tugged harder at the knob as if he did not hear.  Mr Massy blinked
at him.</p>

<p>&quot;He must come away from the door, Mary,&quot; he said.  &quot;There will be a
draught if it is opened.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jack, come away from the door, dear,&quot; said the mother, dexterously
turning the shiny wet baby on to her towelled knee, then glancing
round:  &quot;Go and tell Auntie Louisa about the train.&quot;</p>

<p>Louisa, also afraid to open the door, was watching the scene on the
hearth.  Mr Massy stood holding the baby's flannel, as if assisting
at some ceremonial.  If everybody had not been subduedly angry, it
would have been ridiculous.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to see out of the window,&quot; Jack said.  His father turned
hastily.</p>

<p>&quot;Do YOU mind lifting him on to a chair, Louisa,&quot; said Mary hastily.
The father was too delicate.</p>

<p>When the baby was flannelled, Mr Massy went upstairs and returned
with four pillows, which he set in the fender to warm.  Then he
stood watching the mother feed her child, obsessed by the idea of
his infant.</p>

<p>Louisa went on with her preparations for the meal.  She could not
have told why she was so sullenly angry.  Mrs Lindley, as usual,
lay silently watching.</p>

<p>Mary carried her child upstairs, followed by her husband with the
pillows.  After a while he came down again.</p>

<p>&quot;What is Mary doing?  Why doesn't she come down to eat?&quot; asked Mrs
Lindley.</p>

<p>&quot;She is staying with baby.  The room is rather cold.  I will ask
the girl to put in a fire.&quot;  He was going absorbedly to the door.</p>

<p>&quot;But Mary has had nothing to eat.  It is SHE who will catch cold,&quot;
said the mother, exasperated.</p>

<p>Mr Massy seemed as if he did not hear.  Yet he looked at his
mother-in-law, and answered:</p>

<p>&quot;I will take her something.&quot;</p>

<p>He went out.  Mrs Lindley shifted on her couch with anger.  Miss
Louisa glowered.  But no one said anything, because of the money
that came to the vicarage from Mr Massy.</p>

<p>Louisa went upstairs.  Her sister was sitting by the bed, reading a
scrap of paper.</p>

<p>&quot;Won't you come down and eat?&quot; the younger asked.</p>

<p>&quot;In a moment or two,&quot; Mary replied, in a quiet, reserved voice,
that forbade anyone to approach her.</p>

<p>It was this that made Miss Louisa most furious.  She went
downstairs, and announced to her mother:</p>

<p>&quot;I am going out.  I may not be home to tea.&quot;</p>
