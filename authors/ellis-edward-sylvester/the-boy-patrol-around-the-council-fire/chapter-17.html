<p>Absolute hush followed the exclamation of young Burton and, as
all were intently listening, there sounded through the soft stillness
of the night a strange, piercing cry,—the baying of a bloodhound
following the trail of a person. It was neither a bark nor a growl,
but a mixture of the two,—a deep howl that might well fill a fleeing
fugitive with shivering fear.</p>

<p>"That’s Zip," said his pleased owner; "he will be here in a few
minutes."</p>

<p>"He has a remarkable voice," said Scout Master Hall; "I never
heard the like."</p>

<p>Mike Murphy, who had been one of the most absorbed of listeners
and was seated near the guest, rose to his feet and emitted a
cry which, so far as the listeners could tell, was an absolutely
perfect imitation of that of the dog.</p>

<p>"That’s wonderful!" exclaimed Burton; "it would deceive any one
except the dog himself."</p>

<p>"And why not him?" asked Alvin Landon.</p>

<p>"Because he does not answer—there he comes!"</p>

<p>In the dim moonlight, as every eye was turned in the direction
of the beach leading toward Uncle Elk’s cabin, the Scouts saw
a black, medium sized dog approaching at full speed, his sturdy
figure rapidly assuming definite form. It was to be noted that
Burton had come through the wood itself, whereas the animal was
traversing the beach, where the way was more open, yet he was
keeping to the trail as unerringly as an arrow driven from the
bow.</p>

<p>"Hide yourself," whispered Mr. Hall.</p>

<p>"There is no place where I can hide from him."</p>

<p>The next instant the hound with undiminished speed bounded up
the steps at the end of the porch, dashed between the boys, and
impinged with such force against his standing master that he was
knocked backward for a pace or two. Bending over, Burton patted
the big head, and Zip in his excess of delight bounded round the
youth and wagged his tail so hard that it swayed his haunches
correspondingly, and it really seemed an instance of the tail
wagging the dog.</p>

<p>"Don’t you think Zip will appreciate something in the form of
a meal?" asked Mr. Hall.</p>

<p>"He certainly will; a dog is always hungry, and more than half
a day has passed since he ate; nothing suits him better than raw
meat."</p>

<p>"We have a supply, and he shall feast to his heart’s content."</p>

<p>So he did, the food being brought out and placed in front of
the canine guest, who would have eaten a good deal more had his
master permitted. Meekly accepting the decision, Zip lay down
at young Burton’s feet, contented and happy throughout the remainder
of the evening, and glad to stay outside until the youth rejoined
him in the morning.</p>

<p>"You know what matchless policemen the Belgian dogs make in that
country, in France, and in New York and other cities. Some three
years ago Long Island became so pestered by thieves that Robert
E. Kerkham, superintendent of the railway police, saw that something
drastic had to be done. The thieves dynamited station safes, burglarized
private dwellings and more than once killed and injured railway
policemen while they were trying to arrest the criminals. Those
men used fleet horses and automobiles, and despite everything
that could be done, grew bolder and more successful.</p>

<p>"Superintendent Kerkham, finding that his patrolmen were powerless,
decided to call in the help of dogs, with whose striking success
abroad and at home he was familiar, but he made a new departure
by taking bloodhounds instead of the usual police dogs, for the
former would not only guard property but would track the thieves.
He bought a pair from the stock imported from England more than
twenty years ago. These are of the purest blood, and superior
to all others. Zip is from the same stock. A peculiarity of this
dog is that in no circumstances will he take up a doubtful trail,
but will pick up the true scent, no matter how faint, and never
abandon it so long as it actually exists. They know not the meaning
of fear, and will stick to their work so long as they can move
or breathe. Some of those dogs have pedigrees that reach backward
to the time of William the Conqueror.</p>

<p>"The couple which Mr. Kerkham purchased are named Bob and Nellie.
They had to be trained, but they learned fast. They will take
the scent from any article that has been lately handled by the
person they are after."</p>

<p>"How old a trail will serve them?" asked the Scout Master.</p>

<p>"Of course the freshest scent is the best. Zip was all of seven
hours behind me to-day. I have tested him on double that time
and he seemed to have little or no difficulty. They have taken
a trail twenty-four hours old, and precisely what it is that guides
them in such a case is more than any one can understand. A man
is known to have left a house at a certain time, and twenty hours
later it is decided to pursue him with the aid of a bloodhound.
A glove, or hat, or shoe that he is known to have worn is held
in front of the dog; he sniffs at it, dashes out of doors, circles
back and forth and around the grounds until he strikes the corresponding
scent; up goes his head, his tail wags and he bays his pleasure.
A hundred yards farther, and he drops his nose to the ground to
make sure he has not lost his clue.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the scent grows faint or disappears. In that case he
runs back and circles about until he picks it up again, when he
is off once more. You must remember that while all this is going
on there is a man tugging at the leash, for this is necessary
to protect the thief. As the trail grows fresher, the fierce eagerness
of the hound increases; he knows he is close upon his quarry and
sharp words and powerful pulling are necessary to prevent him
from bounding straight at the throat of the cowering wretch. Should
he start to run it is almost impossible to restrain the dog, but
when he sees the criminal is under arrest, he is satisfied, becomes
quiet, and is ready to tackle the next job."</p>

<p>"Will you tell us of some of the exploits of Bob and Nellie,
who you say are perfect specimens of their kind?"</p>

<p>"I cannot recall a quarter of them. One thing that Bob did was
astonishing because it was at the beginning of his training and
the scent was fourteen hours old. He caught it from a bag which
the thieves had used to wrap about their hands in breaking a window.
As true as the needle to the pole, Bob led his master through
alleys and side streets, across vacant lots, along the purlieus
of a straggling village to a house near the highway. This was
circled once, and then he dashed to a barn at the rear, through
the open door, and sprang at a young man who was engaged in skinning
a muskrat he had trapped.</p>

<p>"The fellow was indignant and denied all knowledge of the crime,
declaring that he did not know where the freight house was located,
but Bob’s trainer was certain the dog was right, and searched
the place. All the missing property was found in a trunk, and
the thief is now in Sing Sing, convicted on the testimony of the
dog.</p>

<p>"Last summer a farmer in Kansas was murdered and a pack of hounds
were put on the trail. They led the trainers and officers through
a broken country for six miles, never hesitating or turning aside
for a minute, until they reached a house where a man lived who
had never been suspected. He was arrested, corroborative evidence
obtained, and he was convicted by the Supreme Court of the state
and executed.</p>

<p>"One night the safe of the Hicksville station on the Long Island
Railroad was blown open and the contents stolen. Three of the
dogs were brought up the next day a little before noon and put
on the trail, about twelve hours after the robbery had been committed."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," remarked Scout Master Hall, "that in all such
cases the hounds are very liable to blunder."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"There must be a good many tracks about the premises; how can
they differentiate those of the thieves?"</p>

<p>"They took the scent without the least difficulty from the window
through which the robbers had entered and from the articles they
had handled. Tugging at their leashes, the hounds led their masters
up the railway track for an eighth of a mile, and then turned
off across the open country to the trolley track, which they followed
to the next stop, where the trail ended. Inquiries brought out
the fact that the car had stopped there about midnight,—something
which it rarely did. Having boarded it, the thieves made their
escape, and that became one of the few instances in which the
skill of the bloodhounds came to naught.</p>

<p>"But the dogs were not allowed to rust for want of work. Long
Island gave them plenty to do, and continues to do so. When word
came to headquarters that the station at Warwick Street on the
Atlantic Division of the railway had been broken into and robbed,
the dogs were put on the job with the least possible delay. They
found the trail without trouble, and skurried down Atlantic Avenue
to Logan Street, where the canines halted for consultation, since
they had to face new conditions.</p>

<p>"These wonderful brutes had been instant to detect that two thieves
were concerned in the crime. At the point named, the trail divided,
and of course the pursuers did the same. Our old friend Bob trotted
along until he reached No. 129, where he sat down, threw up his
head and began howling. Jim, the other dog, kept on to No. 219,
where he joined in the dismal chorus. The two were on the same
side of the street, not very far apart, and must have made a striking
picture, as from their different stations they serenaded some
persons within. I can’t help wondering," added young Burton with
a laugh, "whether the thieves noticed that howling, and peeping
out of the windows suspected what it meant.</p>

<p>"The trainers thought it possible a mistake had been made, and
the dogs were taken back to the station and given the scent again.
They followed it as unerringly as before, but oddly enough when
they came to the forking of the trail, Bob and Jim changed places.
It was as if one had proposed the shift to the other, who accepted
it offhand.</p>

<p>"Doubting no longer, the officers arrested a schoolboy in each
house, whom the dogs identified. They confessed their guilt, and
one was sent to the Juvenile Asylum at Dobbs Ferry and the other
to the Elmira Reformatory.</p>

<p>"Now," said Burton, whose enthusiasm was natural, "can any one
understand what it is that guides the bloodhound? Of course it
is some sort of emanation, but how subtle it must be, and how
fine the sense that can identify it among scores of others! In
the incident I have just related, the trail led through busy streets,
where hundreds of men, women and animals had trodden upon the
invisible footprints, each with his or her peculiar odor, which
lingered for hours, and was as distinct to the dogs as the call
of a megaphone is to us. It is beyond my comprehension."</p>

<p>"It is beyond the comprehension of any one," added Mr. Hall.
"Bertillon has proved that the thumb prints of no two persons
are the same, and so the scent of every one has a peculiarity
of its own, but that doesn’t lessen our wonder.</p>

<p>"There is no end to the proofs that have been given of their
miraculous power."</p>

<p>"The dogs, I suppose, seem to enjoy tracking a criminal?"</p>

<p>"It is their delight. Although not credited with a high order
of intelligence, they know as well as their trainers what is expected
of them, and enter into it with as much gusto as you boys do your
vacation."</p>

<p>"Is a criminal when overtaken by the dogs in danger of being
hurt by them?"</p>

<p>"It depends upon himself. If he continues to run and puts up
a fight they will attack him. If he quietly submits, they will
mount guard and hold him unharmed until their master comes up
and takes the criminal into custody. Then the dogs, seeing that
that particular task is finished, show by their behavior that
they are as eager as ever for their next job. But, for safety’s
sake, they are generally held in leash, master and dog keeping
company."</p>

<p>"How is it with Zip?"</p>

<p>"He always runs free, and will not harm a fugitive unless ordered
to do so. You understand that he and I are chums, and I have never
used him to chase a criminal. He roams through the country, and
I keep him on edge by such tests as to-day. He is so familiar
with my scent that he will pick it up instantly, without first
sniffing articles I have worn. The other day I played a mean trick
on him. I left him at the Samoset House on Mouse Island and started
for Boothbay Harbor on the steamer <em>Wiwurna</em>, but instead
of getting off at the wharf, I slipped over the gunwale at the
rear, and Captain Free McKown took me on board his motor boat
<em>Edith</em> which was lying near, and started back to Mouse
Island with me. Just before reaching the dock I met the <em>Norman
II</em> starting for Boothbay and seated on his haunches at the
prow was Zip. I was not expecting to see him and I should have
got out of sight, but he discovered me and emitted the most dissatisfied
howl I ever heard. It said as plain as so many words, ‘You played
me a low down trick, and I don’t like it.’ He would have sprung
overboard and tried to swim to me, had I not forbidden him. Perforce
he went on to Boothbay and came back on the <em>Norman II</em>.
I was in my room when he scratched on my door and I admitted him.
He was so mad that he refused to eat the meat prepared for him,
and pouted the rest of the day. I apologized and coaxed, and by
night had won back his favor and the cloud between us passed away." </p>
