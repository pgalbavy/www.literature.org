<p>The plaza at Fortuna, ordinarily so peaceful and sleepy, was alive
with hurrying men when Bud and Phil reached town. Over at the station
a special engine was wheezing and blowing after its heavy run and,
from the train of commandeered ore-cars behind, a swarm of soldiers
were leaping to the ground. On the porch of the hotel Don Juan de Dios
Brachamonte was making violent signals with his hands, and as they rode
up he hurried out to meet them.
</p><p>"My gracious, boys," he cried, "it's a good thing you came into town!
Bernardo Bravo has come over the mountains and he's marching to take
Moctezuma!"
</p><p>"Why, that doesn't make any difference to us!" answered Phil.
"Moctezuma is eighty miles from here--and look at all the soldiers. How
many men has Bernardo got?"
</p><p>"Well, that I do not know," responded Don Juan; "some say more and
some less, but if you boys hadn't come in I would have sent a man to
fetch you. Just as soon as a revolution begins the back country becomes
unsafe for Americans. Some of these low characters are likely to murder
you if they think you have any money."
</p><p>"Well, we haven't," put in Bud; "but we've got a mine--and we're going
to keep it, too."
</p><p>"Aw, Bernardo Bravo hasn't got any men!" scoffed Phil. "I bet this is
a false alarm. He got whipped out of his boots over in Chihauhua last
fall, and he's been up in the Sierra Madres ever since. Probably come
down to steal a little beef.
</p><p>"Why, Don Juan, Bud and I lived right next to a trail all last year
and if we'd listened to one-tenth of the <u>revoltoso</u> stories we heard
we wouldn't have taken out an ounce of gold. I'm going to get my
denouncement papers to-morrow, and I'll bet you we work that mine all
summer and never know the difference. These rebels won't hurt you any,
anyhow!"
</p><p>"No! Only beg a little grub!" added Bud scornfully. "Come on, Phil;
let's go over and look at the soldiers--it's that bunch of Yaquis we
saw up at Agua Negra."
</p><p>They tied their horses to the rack and, leaving the solicitous Don Juan
to sputter, hurried over to the yard. From the heavy metal ore-cars,
each a rolling fortress in itself, the last of the active Yaquis
were helping out their women and pet dogs, while the rest, talking
and laughing in high spirits, were strung out along the track in a
perfunctory line.
</p><p>If the few officers in command had ever attempted to teach them
military discipline, the result was not apparent in the line they
formed; but any man who looked at their swarthy faces, the hawklike
profiles, and deep-set, steady eyes, would know that they were
fighters.
</p><p>After all, a straight line on parade has very little to do with actual
warfare, and these men had proved their worth under fire.
</p><p>To be sure, it was the fire of Mexican guns, and perhaps that was why
the officers were so quiet and unassertive; for every one of these big,
upstanding Indians had been captured in the Yaqui wars and deported to
the henequen fields of Yucatan to die in the miasma and heat.
</p><p>But they had come from a hardy breed and the whirligig of fortune was
flying fast--Madero defeated Porfirio Diaz; fresh revolutions broke out
against the victor, and, looking about in desperation for soldiers to
fill his ranks, Madero fell upon the Yaquis.
</p><p>Trained warriors for generations, of a race so fierce that the
ancient Aztecs had been turned aside by them in their empire-founding
migration, they were the very men to whip back the rebels, if he could
but win them to his side.
</p><p>So Madero had approached Chief Bule, whom Diaz had taken under a flag
of truce, and soon the agreement was made. In return for faithful
service, Mexico would give back to the Indians the one thing they had
been fighting a hundred and sixty years to attain, their land along the
Rio Yaqui; and there they should be permitted to live in peace as their
ancestors had done before them.
</p><p>And so, with a thousand or more of his men, the crafty old war-chief
had taken service in the Federal army, though his mind, poisoned
perhaps by the treachery he had suffered, was not entirely free from
guile.
</p><p>"It is the desire of the Yaquis," he had said, when rebuked for serving
under the hated flag of Mexico, "to kill Mexicans, And," he added
grimly, "the Federals at this time seem best able to give us guns for
that purpose."
</p><p>But it had been a year now since Bule had passed his word and, though
they had battled valiantly, their land had not been given back to
them. The wild Yaquis, the irreconcilables who never came down from
the hills, had gone on the war-path again, but Bule and his men still
served.
</p><p>Only in two things did they disobey their officers--they would not
stack their arms, and they would not retreat while there were still
more Mexicans to be killed. Otherwise they were very good soldiers.
</p><p>But now, after the long campaign in Chihuahua and a winter of idleness
at Agua Negra, they were marching south toward their native land and,
in spite of the stern glances of their leaders, they burst forth in
weird Yaqui songs which, if their words had been known, might easily
have caused their Mexican officers some slight uneasiness.
</p><p>It was, in fact, only a question of days, months, or years until the
entire Yaqui contingent would desert, taking their arms and ammunition
with them.
</p><p>"Gee! what a bunch of men!" exclaimed Bud, as he stood off and admired
their stark forms.
</p><p>"There's some genuine fighters for you," he observed to Phil; and a
giant Yaqui, standing near, returned his praise with a smile.
</p><p>"W'y, hello there, Amigo!" hailed Bud, jerking his head in a friendly
salute. "That's a feller I was making signs to up in Agua Negra," he
explained. "Dogged if I ain't stuck on these Yaquis--they're all men,
believe me!"
</p><p>"Good workers, all right," conceded De Lancey, "but I'd hate to have
'em get after me with those guns. They say they've killed a lot of
Americans, one time and another."
</p><p>"Well, if they did it was for being caught in bad company," said
Hooker. "I'd take a chance with 'em any time--but if you go into their
country with a Mexican escort they'll kill you on general principles.
Say," he cried impulsively, "I'm going over to talk with Amigo!"
</p><p>With a broad grin on his honest face he advanced toward the giant Yaqui
and shook hands ceremoniously.
</p><p>"Where you go?" he inquired in Spanish, at the same time rolling a
cigarette and asking by a sign for a match.
</p><p>"Moctezuma," answered the Indian gravely. Then, as Bud offered him the
makings, he, too, rolled a cigarette and they smoked for a minute in
silence.
</p><p>"You live here?" inquired the Yaqui at last.
</p><p>"Come here," corrected Bud. "I have a mine--ten miles--over there."
</p><p>He pointed with the flat of his hand, Indian fashion, and Amigo nodded
understandingly.
</p><p>He was a fine figure of a man, standing six feet or better in his
well-cut sandals and handling his heavy Mauser as a child would
swing a stick. Across his broad chest he wore a full cartridge-belt,
and around his waist he had two more, filled to the last hole with
cartridges and loaded clips. At his feet lay his blanket, bound into a
tight roll, and a canteen and coffee-cup completed his outfit, which,
so far as impedimenta were concerned, was simplicity itself.
</p><p>But instead of the cheap linen uniform of the Federals he was dressed
in good American clothes--a striped shirt, overalls, and a sombrero
banded with a bright ribbon--and in place of the beaten, hunted look of
those poor conscripts he had the steady gaze of a free man.
</p><p>They stood and smoked for a few moments, talking briefly, and then, as
the Yaquis closed up their ranks and marched off to make camp for the
night, Bud presented his strange friend with the sack of tobacco and
went back to join his pardner.
</p><p>That evening the plaza was filled with the wildest rumors, and another
train arrived during the night, but through it all Bud and Phil
remained unimpressed. In the morning the soldiers went marching off
down the trail, leaving a great silence where all had been bugle-calls
and excitement, and then the first fugitive came in from down below.
</p><p>He was an old Mexican, with trembling beard and staring eyes, and he
told a tale of outrage that made their blood run cold. The red-flaggers
had come to his house at night; they had killed his wife and son, left
him upon the ground for dead, and carried off his daughter, a prisoner.
</p><p>But later, when the <u>comisario</u> questioned him sharply, it developed
that he lived not far away, had no daughter to lose, and was, in fact,
only a crazed old man who told for truth that which he feared would
happen.
</p><p>Notwithstanding the d√©nouement, his story stirred the Mexican
population to the depths, and when Bud and Phil tried to hire men to
push the work on the mine, they realized that their troubles had begun.
Not only was it impossible to engage laborers at any price, but on
the following day Cruz Mendez, with his wife and children and all his
earthy possessions on his burros, came hurrying in from the camp and
told them he could serve them no more.
</p><p>"It is my woman," he explained; "my Maria! Ah, if those <u>revoltosos</u>
should see Maria they would steal her before my eyes!"
</p><p>So he was given his pay and the fifty dollars he had earned and, after
the customary "<u>Muchas gracias</u>," and with the faithful Maria by his
side, he went hurrying off to the store.
</p><p>And now in crowded vehicles, with armed men riding in front and behind,
the refugees from Moctezuma and the hot country began to pour into
town, adding by their very haste to the panic of all who saw them.
</p><p>They were the rich property-owners who, having been subjected to forced
contribution before, were now fleeing at the first rumor of danger,
bringing their families with them to escape any being held for ransom.
</p><p>In half a day the big hotel presided over by Don Juan de Dios
Brachamonte was swarming with staring-eyed country mothers and sternly
subdued families of children; and finally, to add √©clat to the
occasion and compensate for the general confusion, Don Cipriano Aragon
y Tres Palacios came driving up to the door with his wife and the
smiling Gracia.
</p><p>If she had been in any fear of capture by bold marauders, Gracia Aragon
did not show it now, as she sprang lightly from the carriage and waited
upon her lady mother. Perhaps, after a year or more of rumors and
alarms, she had come to look upon impending revolutionary conflicts as
convenient excuses for a trip to town, a long stop at the hotel, and
even a dash to gay Gadsden in case the rebels pressed close.
</p><p>However that may be, while Don Juan exerted himself to procure them a
good room she endured the gaze of the American guests with becoming
placidity and, as that took some time, she even ventured to look the
Americans over and make some comments to her mother.
</p><p>And then--or as it seemed to Bud--the mother glanced up quickly and
fixed her eyes upon him. After that he was in less of a hurry to return
to the mine, and Phil said they would stay inside for a week. But
as for Don Cipriano, when he came across them it was with malignant
insolence and he abruptly turned his back.
</p><p>At La Fortuna he was the lord and master, with power to forbid them the
place; but now once more the fortunes of war had turned against him,
and he was forced to tolerate their presence.
</p><p>The band played in the plaza that evening, it being Thursday of the
week, and as the cornet led with "La Paloma," and the bass viol and
guitars beat the measure, all feet seemed to turn in that direction,
and the fear of the raiders was stilled.
</p><p>Around and around the band-stand and in and out beneath the trees the
pleasure-loving maidens from down below walked decorously with their
mothers; and the little band of Fortuna Americans, to whom life for
some months had been a trifle burdensome, awoke suddenly to the beauty
of the evening.
</p><p>And among the rest of the maidens, but far more ravishing and
high-bred, walked Gracia Aragon, at whom Bud in particular stole many
secret glances from beneath the broad brim of his hat, hoping that by
some luck the <u>insurrectos</u> would come upon the town, and he could
defend her--he alone. For he felt that he could do it against any
hundred Mexicans that ever breathed.
