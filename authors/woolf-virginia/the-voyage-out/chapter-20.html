<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>When considered in detail by Mr. Flushing and Mrs. Ambrose the
expedition proved neither dangerous nor difficult. They found
also that it was not even unusual. Every year at this season English
people made parties which steamed a short way up the river, landed,
and looked at the native village, bought a certain number of things
from the natives, and returned again without damage done to mind
or body. When it was discovered that six people really wished
the same thing the arrangements were soon carried out.</p>

<p>Since the time of Elizabeth very few people had seen the river,
and nothing has been done to change its appearance from what it
was to the eyes of the Elizabethan voyagers. The time of Elizabeth
was only distant from the present time by a moment of space compared
with the ages which had passed since the water had run between
those banks, and the green thickets swarmed there, and the small
trees had grown to huge wrinkled trees in solitude. Changing only
with the change of the sun and the clouds, the waving green mass
had stood there for century after century, and the water had run
between its banks ceaselessly, sometimes washing away earth and
sometimes the branches of trees, while in other parts of the world
one town had risen upon the ruins of another town, and the men
in the towns had become more and more articulate and unlike each
other. A few miles of this river were visible from the top of
the mountain where some weeks before the party from the hotel
had picnicked. Susan and Arthur had seen it as they kissed each
other, and Terence and Rachel as they sat talking about Richmond,
and Evelyn and Perrott as they strolled about, imagining that
they were great captains sent to colonise the world. They had
seen the broad blue mark across the sand where it flowed into
the sea, and the green cloud of trees mass themselves about it
farther up, and finally hide its waters altogether from sight.
At intervals for the first twenty miles or so houses were scattered
on the bank; by degrees the houses became huts, and, later still,
there was neither hut nor house, but trees and grass, which were
seen only by hunters, explorers, or merchants, marching or sailing,
but making no settlement.</p>

<p>By leaving Santa Marina early in the morning, driving twenty
miles and riding eight, the party, which was composed finally
of six English people, reached the river-side as the night fell.
They came cantering through the trees &mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Flushing,
Helen Ambrose, Rachel, Terence, and St. John. The tired little
horses then stopped automatically, and the English dismounted.
Mrs. Flushing strode to the river-bank in high spirits. The day
had been long and hot, but she had enjoyed the speed and the open
air; she had left the hotel which she hated, and she found the
company to her liking. The river was swirling past in the darkness;
they could just distinguish the smooth moving surface of the water,
and the air was full of the sound of it. They stood in an empty
space in the midst of great tree-trunks, and out there a little
green light moving slightly up and down showed them where the
steamer lay in which they were to embark.</p>

<p>When they all stood upon its deck they found that it was a very
small boat which throbbed gently beneath them for a few minutes,
and then shoved smoothly through the water. They seemed to be
driving into the heart of the night, for the trees closed in front
of them, and they could hear all round them the rustling of leaves.
The great darkness had the usual effect of taking away all desire
for communication by making their words sound thin and small;
and, after walking round the deck three or four times, they clustered
together, yawning deeply, and looking at the same spot of deep
gloom on the banks. Murmuring very low in the rhythmical tone
of one oppressed by the air, Mrs. Flushing began to wonder where
they were to sleep, for they could not sleep downstairs, they
could not sleep in a doghole smelling of oil, they could not sleep
on deck, they could not sleep &mdash;She yawned profoundly. It
was as Helen had foreseen; the question of nakedness had risen
already, although they were half asleep, and almost invisible
to each other. With St. John's help she stretched an awning, and
persuaded Mrs. Flushing that she could take off her clothes behind
this, and that no one would notice if by chance some part of her
which had been concealed for forty-five years was laid bare to
the human eye. Mattresses were thrown down, rugs provided, and
the three women lay near each other in the soft open air.</p>

<p>The gentlemen, having smoked a certain number of cigarettes,
dropped the glowing ends into the river, and looked for a time
at the ripples wrinkling the black water beneath them, undressed
too, and lay down at the other end of the boat. They were very
tired, and curtained from each other by the darkness. The light
from one lantern fell upon a few ropes, a few planks of the deck,
and the rail of the boat, but beyond that there was unbroken darkness,
no light reached their faces, or the trees which were massed on
the sides of the river.</p>

<p>Soon Wilfrid Flushing slept, and Hirst slept. Hewet alone lay
awake looking straight up into the sky. The gentle motion and
the black shapes that were drawn ceaselessly across his eyes had
the effect of making it impossible for him to think. Rachel's
presence so near him lulled thought asleep. Being so near him,
only a few paces off at the other end of the boat, she made it
as impossible for him to think about her as it would have been
impossible to see her if she had stood quite close to him, her
forehead against his forehead. In some strange way the boat became
identified with himself, and just as it would have been useless
for him to get up and steer the boat, so was it useless for him
to struggle any longer with the irresistible force of his own
feelings. He was drawn on and on away from all he knew, slipping
over barriers and past landmarks into unknown waters as the boat
glided over the smooth surface of the river. In profound peace,
enveloped in deeper unconsciousness than had been his for many
nights, he lay on deck watching the tree-tops change their position
slightly against the sky, and arch themselves, and sink and tower
huge, until he passed from seeing them into dreams where he lay
beneath the shadow of the vast trees, looking up into the sky.</p>

<p>When they woke next morning they had gone a considerable way
up the river; on the right was a high yellow bank of sand tufted
with trees, on the left a swamp quivering with long reeds and
tall bamboos on the top of which, swaying slightly, perched vivid
green and yellow birds. The morning was hot and still. After breakfast
they drew chairs together and sat in an irregular semicircle in
the bow. An awning above their heads protected them from the heat
of the sun, and the breeze which the boat made aired them softly.
Mrs. Flushing was already dotting and striping her canvas, her
head jerking this way and that with the action of a bird nervously
picking up grain; the others had books or pieces of paper or embroidery
on their knees, at which they looked fitfully and again looked
at the river ahead. At one point Hewet read part of a poem aloud,
but the number of moving things entirely vanquished his words.
He ceased to read, and no one spoke. They moved on under the shelter
of the trees. There was now a covey of red birds feeding on one
of the little islets to the left, or again a blue-green parrot
flew shrieking from tree to tree. As they moved on the country
grew wilder and wilder. The trees and the undergrowth seemed to
be strangling each other near the ground in a multitudinous wrestle;
while here and there a splendid tree towered high above the swarm,
shaking its thin green umbrellas lightly in the upper air. Hewet
looked at his books again. The morning was peaceful as the night
had been, only it was very strange because he could see it was
light, and he could see Rachel and hear her voice and be near
to her. He felt as if he were waiting, as if somehow he were stationary
among things that passed over him and around him, voices, people's
bodies, birds, only Rachel too was waiting with him. He looked
at her sometimes as if she must know that they were waiting together,
and being drawn on together, without being able to offer any resistance.
Again he read from his book:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Whoever you are holding me now in your hand,<br/>
Without one thing all will be useless.

</p>
</div>
<p>A bird gave a wild laugh, a monkey chuckled a malicious question,
and, as fire fades in the hot sunshine, his words flickered and
went out.</p>

<p>By degrees as the river narrowed, and the high sandbanks fell
to level ground thickly grown with trees, the sounds of the forest
could be heard. It echoed like a hall. There were sudden cries;
and then long spaces of silence, such as there are in a cathedral
when a boy's voice has ceased and the echo of it still seems to
haunt about the remote places of the roof. Once Mr. Flushing rose
and spoke to a sailor, and even announced that some time after
luncheon the steamer would stop, and they could walk a little
way through the forest.</p>

<p>"There are tracks all through the trees there," he explained.
"We're no distance from civilisation yet."</p>

<p>He scrutinised his wife's painting. Too polite to praise it openly,
he contented himself with cutting off one half of the picture
with one hand, and giving a flourish in the air with the other.</p>

<p>"God!" Hirst exclaimed, staring straight ahead. "Don't you think
it's amazingly beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful?" Helen enquired. It seemed a strange little word,
and Hirst and herself both so small that she forgot to answer
him.</p>

<p>Hewet felt that he must speak.</p>

<p>"That's where the Elizabethans got their style," he mused, staring
into the profusion of leaves and blossoms and prodigious fruits.</p>

<p>"Shakespeare? I hate Shakespeare!" Mrs. Flushing exclaimed; and
Wilfrid returned admiringly, "I believe you're the only person
who dares to say that, Alice." But Mrs. Flushing went on painting.
She did not appear to attach much value to her husband's compliment,
and painted steadily, sometimes muttering a half-audible word
or groan.</p>

<p>The morning was now very hot.</p>

<p>"Look at Hirst!" Mr. Flushing whispered. His sheet of paper had
slipped on to the deck, his head lay back, and he drew a long
snoring breath.</p>

<p>Terence picked up the sheet of paper and spread it out before
Rachel. It was a continuation of the poem on God which he had
begun in the chapel, and it was so indecent that Rachel did not
understand half of it although she saw that it was indecent. Hewet
began to fill in words where Hirst had left spaces, but he soon
ceased; his pencil rolled on deck. Gradually they approached nearer
and nearer to the bank on the right-hand side, so that the light
which covered them became definitely green, falling through a
shade of green leaves, and Mrs. Flushing set aside her sketch
and stared ahead of her in silence. Hirst woke up; they were then
called to luncheon, and while they ate it, the steamer came to
a standstill a little way out from the bank. The boat which was
towed behind them was brought to the side, and the ladies were
helped into it.</p>

<p>For protection against boredom, Helen put a book of memoirs beneath
her arm, and Mrs. Flushing her paint-box, and, thus equipped,
they allowed themselves to be set on shore on the verge of the
forest.</p>

<p>They had not strolled more than a few hundred yards along the
track which ran parallel with the river before Helen professed
to find it was unbearably hot. The river breeze had ceased, and
a hot steamy atmosphere, thick with scents, came from the forest.</p>

<p>"I shall sit down here," she announced, pointing to the trunk
of a tree which had fallen long ago and was now laced across and
across by creepers and thong-like brambles. She seated herself,
opened her parasol, and looked at the river which was barred by
the stems of trees. She turned her back to the trees which disappeared
in black shadow behind her.</p>

<p>"I quite agree," said Mrs. Flushing, and proceeded to undo her
paint-box. Her husband strolled about to select an interesting
point of view for her. Hirst cleared a space on the ground by
Helen's side, and seated himself with great deliberation, as if
he did not mean to move until he had talked to her for a long
time. Terence and Rachel were left standing by themselves without
occupation. Terence saw that the time had come as it was fated
to come, but although he realised this he was completely calm
and master of himself. He chose to stand for a few moments talking
to Helen, and persuading her to leave her seat. Rachel joined
him too in advising her to come with them.</p>

<p>"Of all the people I've ever met," he said, "you're the least
adventurous. You might be sitting on green chairs in Hyde Park.
Are you going to sit there the whole afternoon? Aren't you going
to walk?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Helen, "one's only got to use one's eye. There's
everything here&mdash;everything," she repeated in a drowsy tone of
voice. "What will you gain by walking?"</p>

<p>"You'll be hot and disagreeable by tea-time, we shall be cool
and sweet," put in Hirst. Into his eyes as he looked up at them
had come yellow and green reflections from the sky and the branches,
robbing them of their intentness, and he seemed to think what
he did not say. It was thus taken for granted by them both that
Terence and Rachel proposed to walk into the woods together; with
one look at each other they turned away.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" cried Rachel.</p>

<p>"Good-by. Beware of snakes," Hirst replied. He settled himself
still more comfortably under the shade of the fallen tree and
Helen's figure. As they went, Mr. Flushing called after them,
"We must start in an hour. Hewet, please remember that. An hour."</p>

<p>Whether made by man, or for some reason preserved by nature,
there was a wide pathway striking through the forest at right
angles to the river. It resembled a drive in an English forest,
save that tropical bushes with their sword-like leaves grew at
the side, and the ground was covered with an unmarked springy
moss instead of grass, starred with little yellow flowers. As
they passed into the depths of the forest the light grew dimmer,
and the noises of the ordinary world were replaced by those creaking
and sighing sounds which suggest to the traveller in a forest
that he is walking at the bottom of the sea. The path narrowed
and turned; it was hedged in by dense creepers which knotted tree
to tree, and burst here and there into star-shaped crimson blossoms.
The sighing and creaking up above were broken every now and then
by the jarring cry of some startled animal. The atmosphere was
close and the air came at them in languid puffs of scent. The
vast green light was broken here and there by a round of pure
yellow sunlight which fell through some gap in the immense umbrella
of green above, and in these yellow spaces crimson and black butterflies
were circling and settling. Terence and Rachel hardly spoke.</p>

<p>Not only did the silence weigh upon them, but they were both
unable to frame any thoughts. There was something between them
which had to be spoken of. One of them had to begin, but which
of them was it to be? Then Hewet picked up a red fruit and threw
it as high as he could. When it dropped, he would speak. They
heard the flapping of great wings; they heard the fruit go pattering
through the leaves and eventually fall with a thud. The silence
was again profound.</p>

<p>"Does this frighten you?" Terence asked when the sound of the
fruit falling had completely died away.</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "I like it."</p>

<p>She repeated "I like it." She was walking fast, and holding herself
more erect than usual. There was another pause.</p>

<p>"You like being with me?" Terence asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, with you," she replied.</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment. Silence seemed to have fallen upon
the world.</p>

<p>"That is what I have felt ever since I knew you," he replied.
"We are happy together." He did not seem to be speaking, or she
to be hearing.</p>

<p>"Very happy," she answered.</p>

<p>They continued to walk for some time in silence. Their steps
unconsciously quickened.</p>

<p>"We love each other," Terence said.</p>

<p>"We love each other," she repeated.</p>

<p>The silence was then broken by their voices which joined in tones
of strange unfamiliar sound which formed no words. Faster and
faster they walked; simultaneously they stopped, clasped each
other in their arms, then releasing themselves, dropped to the
earth. They sat side by side. Sounds stood out from the background
making a bridge across their silence; they heard the swish of
the trees and some beast croaking in a remote world.</p>

<p>"We love each other," Terence repeated, searching into her face.
Their faces were both very pale and quiet, and they said nothing.
He was afraid to kiss her again. By degrees she drew close to
him, and rested against him. In this position they sat for some
time. She said "Terence" once; he answered "Rachel."</p>

<p>"Terrible&mdash;terrible," she murmured after another pause, but in
saying this she was thinking as much of the persistent churning
of the water as of her own feeling. On and on it went in the distance,
the senseless and cruel churning of the water. She observed that
the tears were running down Terence's cheeks.</p>

<p>The next movement was on his part. A very long time seemed to
have passed. He took out his watch.</p>

<p>"Flushing said an hour. We've been gone more than half an hour."</p>

<p>"And it takes that to get back," said Rachel. She raised herself
very slowly. When she was standing up she stretched her arms and
drew a deep breath, half a sigh, half a yawn. She appeared to
be very tired. Her cheeks were white. "Which way?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There," said Terence.</p>

<p>They began to walk back down the mossy path again. The sighing
and creaking continued far overhead, and the jarring cries of
animals. The butterflies were circling still in the patches of
yellow sunlight. At first Terence was certain of his way, but
as they walked he became doubtful. They had to stop to consider,
and then to return and start once more, for although he was certain
of the direction of the river he was not certain of striking the
point where they had left the others. Rachel followed him, stopping
where he stopped, turning where he turned, ignorant of the way,
ignorant why he stopped or why he turned.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be late," he said, "because&mdash;" He put a flower
into her hand and her fingers closed upon it quietly. "We're so
late&mdash;so late&mdash;so horribly late," he repeated as if he were talking
in his sleep. "Ah&mdash;this is right. We turn here."</p>

<p>They found themselves again in the broad path, like the drive
in the English forest, where they had started when they left the
others. They walked on in silence as people walking in their sleep,
and were oddly conscious now and again of the mass of their bodies.
Then Rachel exclaimed suddenly, "Helen!"</p>

<p>In the sunny space at the edge of the forest they saw Helen still
sitting on the tree-trunk, her dress showing very white in the
sun, with Hirst still propped on his elbow by her side. They stopped
instinctively. At the sight of other people they could not go
on. They stood hand in hand for a minute or two in silence. They
could not bear to face other people.</p>

<p>"But we must go on," Rachel insisted at last, in the curious
dull tone of voice in which they had both been speaking, and with
a great effort they forced themselves to cover the short distance
which lay between them and the pair sitting on the tree-trunk.</p>

<p>As they approached, Helen turned round and looked at them. She
looked at them for some time without speaking, and when they were
close to her she said quietly:</p>

<p>"Did you meet Mr. Flushing? He has gone to find you. He thought
you must be lost, though I told him you weren't lost."</p>

<p>Hirst half turned round and threw his head back so that he looked
at the branches crossing themselves in the air above him.</p>

<p>"Well, was it worth the effort?" he enquired dreamily.</p>

<p>Hewet sat down on the grass by his side and began to fan himself.</p>

<p>Rachel had balanced herself near Helen on the end of the tree
trunk.</p>

<p>"Very hot," she said.</p>

<p>"You look exhausted anyhow," said Hirst.</p>

<p>"It's fearfully close in those trees," Helen remarked, picking
up her book and shaking it free from the dried blades of grass
which had fallen between the leaves. Then they were all silent,
looking at the river swirling past in front of them between the
trunks of the trees until Mr. Flushing interrupted them. He broke
out of the trees a hundred yards to the left, exclaiming sharply:</p>

<p>"Ah, so you found the way after all. But it's late&mdash;much later
than we arranged, Hewet."</p>

<p>He was slightly annoyed, and in his capacity as leader of the
expedition, inclined to be dictatorial. He spoke quickly, using
curiously sharp, meaningless words.</p>

<p>"Being late wouldn't matter normally, of course," he said, "but
when it's a question of keeping the men up to time&mdash;"</p>

<p>He gathered them together and made them come down to the river-bank,
where the boat was waiting to row them out to the steamer.</p>

<p>The heat of the day was going down, and over their cups of tea
the Flushings tended to become communicative. It seemed to Terence
as he listened to them talking, that existence now went on in
two different layers. Here were the Flushings talking, talking
somewhere high up in the air above him, and he and Rachel had
dropped to the bottom of the world together. But with something
of a child's directness, Mrs. Flushing had also the instinct which
leads a child to suspect what its elders wish to keep hidden.
She fixed Terence with her vivid blue eyes and addressed herself
to him in particular. What would he do, she wanted to know, if
the boat ran upon a rock and sank.</p>

<p>"Would you care for anythin' but savin' yourself? Should I? No,
no," she laughed, "not one scrap&mdash;don't tell me. There's only
two creatures the ordinary woman cares about," she continued,
"her child and her dog; and I don't believe it's even two with
men. One reads a lot about love&mdash;that's why poetry's so dull.
But what happens in real life, he? It ain't love!" she cried.</p>

<p>Terence murmured something unintelligible. Mr. Flushing, however,
had recovered his urbanity. He was smoking a cigarette, and he
now answered his wife.</p>

<p>"You must always remember, Alice," he said, "that your upbringing
was very unnatural&mdash;unusual, I should say. They had no mother,"
he explained, dropping something of the formality of his tone;
"and a father&mdash;he was a very delightful man, I've no doubt, but
he cared only for racehorses and Greek statues. Tell them about
the bath, Alice."</p>

<p>"In the stable-yard," said Mrs. Flushing. "Covered with ice in
winter. We had to get in; if we didn't, we were whipped. The strong
ones lived&mdash;the others died. What you call survival of the fittest&mdash;a
most excellent plan, I daresay, if you've thirteen children!"</p>

<p>"And all this going on in the heart of England, in the nineteenth
century!" Mr. Flushing exclaimed, turning to Helen.</p>

<p>"I'd treat my children just the same if I had any," said Mrs.
Flushing.</p>

<p>Every word sounded quite distinctly in Terence's ears; but what
were they saying, and who were they talking to, and who were they,
these fantastic people, detached somewhere high up in the air?
Now that they had drunk their tea, they rose and leant over the
bow of the boat. The sun was going down, and the water was dark
and crimson. The river had widened again, and they were passing
a little island set like a dark wedge in the middle of the stream.
Two great white birds with red lights on them stood there on stilt-like
legs, and the beach of the island was unmarked, save by the skeleton
print of birds' feet. The branches of the trees on the bank looked
more twisted and angular than ever, and the green of the leaves
was lurid and splashed with gold. Then Hirst began to talk, leaning
over the bow.</p>

<p>"It makes one awfully queer, don't you find?" he complained.
"These trees get on one's nerves&mdash;it's all so crazy. God's undoubtedly
mad. What sane person could have conceived a wilderness like this,
and peopled it with apes and alligators? I should go mad if I
lived here&mdash;raving mad."</p>

<p>Terence attempted to answer him, but Mrs. Ambrose replied instead.
She bade him look at the way things massed themselves&mdash;look at
the amazing colours, look at the shapes of the trees. She seemed
to be protecting Terence from the approach of the others.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Flushing. "And in my opinion," he continued,
"the absence of population to which Hirst objects is precisely
the significant touch. You must admit, Hirst, that a little Italian
town even would vulgarise the whole scene, would detract from
the vastness&mdash;the sense of elemental grandeur." He swept his hands
towards the forest, and paused for a moment, looking at the great
green mass, which was now falling silent. "I own it makes us seem
pretty small&mdash;us, not them." He nodded his head at a sailor who
leant over the side spitting into the river. "And that, I think,
is what my wife feels, the essential superiority of the peasant&mdash;"
Under cover of Mr. Flushing's words, which continued now gently
reasoning with St. John and persuading him, Terence drew Rachel
to the side, pointing ostensibly to a great gnarled tree-trunk
which had fallen and lay half in the water. He wished, at any
rate, to be near her, but he found that he could say nothing.
They could hear Mr. Flushing flowing on, now about his wife, now
about art, now about the future of the country, little meaningless
words floating high in air. As it was becoming cold he began to
pace the deck with Hirst. Fragments of their talk came out distinctly
as they passed&mdash;art, emotion, truth, reality.</p>

<p>"Is it true, or is it a dream?" Rachel murmured, when they had
passed.</p>

<p>"It's true, it's true," he replied.</p>

<p>But the breeze freshened, and there was a general desire for
movement. When the party rearranged themselves under cover of
rugs and cloaks, Terence and Rachel were at opposite ends of the
circle, and could not speak to each other. But as the dark descended,
the words of the others seemed to curl up and vanish as the ashes
of burnt paper, and left them sitting perfectly silent at the
bottom of the world. Occasional starts of exquisite joy ran through
them, and then they were peaceful again.</p>
