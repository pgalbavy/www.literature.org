<P>The discussion was becoming full of bitterness. De Guiche
perfectly understood the whole matter for there was in
Bragelonne's face a look instinctively hostile, while in
that of De Wardes there was something like a determination
to offend. Without inquiring into the different feelings
which actuated his two friends, De Guiche resolved to ward
off the blow which he felt was on the point of being dealt
by one of them, and perhaps by both. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said,
&quot;we must take our leave of each other, I must pay a visit to
Monsieur. You, De Wardes, will accompany me to the Louvre,
and you Raoul, will remain here master of the house; and as
all that is done here is under your advice, you will bestow
the last glance upon my preparations for departure.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul, with the air of one who neither seeks nor fears a
quarrel, bowed his head in token of assent, and seated
himself upon a bench in the sun. &quot;That is well,&quot; said De
Guiche, &quot;remain where you are, Raoul, and tell them to show
you the two horses I have just purchased; you will give me
your opinion, for I only bought them on condition that you
ratified the purchase. By the by, I have to beg your pardon
for having omitted to inquire after the Comte de la Fere.&quot;
While pronouncing these latter words, he closely observed De
Wardes, in order to perceive what effect the name of Raoul's
father would produce upon him. &quot;I thank you,&quot; answered the
young man, &quot;the count is very well.&quot; A gleam of deep hatred
passed into De Wardes' eyes. De Guiche, who appeared not to
notice the foreboding expression, went up to Raoul, and
grasping him by the hand, said,  -  &quot;It is agreed, then,
Bragelonne, is it not, that you will rejoin us in the
courtyard of the Palais-Royal?&quot; He then signed to De Wardes
to follow him who had been engaged in balancing himself
first on one foot, then on the other. &quot;We are going,&quot; said
he, &quot;come, M. Malicorne.&quot; This name made Raoul start; for it
seemed that he had already heard it pronounced before, but
he could not remember on what occasion. While trying to
recall it half-dreamily, yet half-irritated at his
conversation with De Wardes, the three young men set out on
their way towards the Palais-Royal, where Monsieur was
residing. Malicorne learned two things; the first, that the
young men had something to say to each other, and the
second, that he ought not to walk in the same line with
them; and therefore he walked behind. &quot;Are you mad?&quot; said De
Guiche to his companion, as soon as they had left the Hotel
de Grammont; &quot;you attack M. d'Artagnan, and that, too,
before Raoul.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said De Wardes, &quot;what then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean by `what then?'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly, is there any prohibition against attacking M.
d'Artagnan?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But you know very well that M. d'Artagnan was one of those
celebrated and terrible four men who were called the
musketeers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That they may be, but I do not perceive why, on that
account, I should be forbidden to hate M. d'Artagnan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What cause has he given you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Me! personally, none.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why hate him, therefore?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ask my dead father that question.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Really, my dear De Wardes, you surprise me. M. d'Artagnan
is not one to leave unsettled any enmity he may have to
arrange, without completely clearing his account. Your
father, I have heard, on his side, carried matters with a
high hand. Moreover there are no enmities so bitter that
they cannot be washed away by blood, by a good sword-thrust
loyally given.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Listen to me, my dear De Guiche, this inveterate dislike
existed between my father and M. d'Artagnan, and when I was
quite a child, he acquainted me with the reason for it, and,
as forming part of my inheritance, I regard it as a
particular legacy bestowed upon me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And does his hatred concern M. d'Artagnan alone?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As for that, M. d'Artagnan was so intimately associated
with his three friends, that some portion of the full
measure of my hatred falls to their lot, and that hatred is
of such a nature, whenever the opportunity occurs, they
shall have no occasion to complain of their allowance.&quot;</P>
<P>De Guiche had kept his eyes fixed on De Wardes, and
shuddered at the bitter manner in which the young man
smiled. Something like a presentiment flashed across his
mind; he knew that the time had passed away for grands coups
entre gentilshommes; but that the feeling of hatred
treasured up in the mind, instead of being diffused abroad,
was still hatred all the same; that a smile was sometimes as
full of meaning as a threat; and, in a word, that to the
fathers who had hated with their hearts and fought with
their arms, would now succeed the sons, who would indeed
hate with their hearts, but would no longer combat their
enemies, save by means of intrigue or treachery. As,
therefore, it certainly was not Raoul whom he could suspect
either of intrigue or treachery, it was on Raoul's account
that De Guiche trembled. However, while these gloomy
forebodings cast a shade of anxiety over De Guiche's
countenance, De Wardes had resumed the entire mastery over
himself.</P>
<P>&quot;At all events,&quot; he observed, &quot;I have no personal ill-will
towards M. de Bragelonne; I do not know him even.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In any case,&quot; said De Guiche, with a certain amount of
severity in his tone of voice, &quot;do not forget one
circumstance, that Raoul is my most intimate friend;&quot; a
remark at which De Wardes bowed.</P>
<P>The conversation terminated there, although De Guiche tried
his utmost to draw out his secret from him; but, doubtless,
De Wardes had determined to say nothing further, and he
remained impenetrable. De Guiche therefore promised himself
a more satisfactory result with Raoul. In the meantime they
had reached the Palais-Royal, which was surrounded by a
crowd of lookers-on. The household belonging to Monsieur
awaited his command to mount their horses, in order to form
part of the escort of the ambassadors, to whom had been
intrusted the care of bringing the young princess to Paris.
The brilliant display of horses, arms, and rich liveries,
afforded some compensation in those times, thanks to the
kindly feelings of the people, and to the traditions of deep
devotion to their sovereigns, for the enormous expenses
charged upon the taxes. Mazarin had said: &quot;Let them sing,
provided they pay;&quot; while Louis XIV.'s remark was, &quot;Let them
look.&quot; Sight had replaced the voice; the people could still
look, but they were no longer allowed to sing. De Guiche
left De Wardes and Malicorne at the bottom of the grand
staircase, while he himself, who shared the favor and good
graces of Monsieur with the Chevalier de Lorraine, who
always smiled at him most affectionately, though he could
not endure him, went straight to the prince's apartments,
whom he found engaged in admiring himself in the glass, and
rouging his face. In a corner of the cabinet, the Chevalier
de Lorraine was extended full length upon some cushions,
having just had his long hair curled, with which he was
playing in the same manner a woman would have done. The
prince turned round as the count entered, and perceiving who
it was, said:</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! is that you, Guiche, come here and tell me the truth.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know, my lord, it is one of my defects to speak the
truth.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will hardly believe, De Guiche, how that wicked
chevalier has annoyed me.&quot;</P>
<P>The chevalier shrugged his shoulders.</P>
<P>&quot;Why, he pretends,&quot; continued the prince, &quot;that Mademoiselle
Henrietta is better looking as a woman than I am as a man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do not forget, my lord,&quot; said De Guiche, frowning slightly,
&quot;you require me to speak the truth?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said the prince, tremblingly.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, and I shall tell it you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do not be in a hurry, Guiche,&quot; exclaimed the prince, &quot;you
have plenty of time; look at me attentively, and try to
recollect Madame. Besides, her portrait is here. Look at
it.&quot; And he held out to him a miniature of the finest
possible execution. De Guiche took it, and looked at it for
a long time attentively.</P>
<P>&quot;Upon my honor, my lord, this is indeed a most lovely face.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But look at me, count, look at me,&quot; said the prince
endeavoring to direct upon himself the attention of the
count, who was completely absorbed in contemplation of the
portrait.</P>
<P>&quot;It is wonderful,&quot; murmured Guiche.</P>
<P>&quot;Really one would almost imagine you had never seen the
young lady before.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is true, my lord, I have seen her, but it was five years
ago; there is a great difference between a child twelve
years old and a girl of seventeen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, what is your opinion?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My opinion is that the portrait must be flattering, my
lord.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of that,&quot; said the prince triumphantly, &quot;there can be no
doubt, but let us suppose that it is not, what would your
opinion be?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My lord, that your highness is exceedingly happy to have so
charming a bride.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, that is your opinion of her, but of me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My opinion, my lord, is that you are too handsome for a
man.&quot;</P>
<P>The Chevalier de Lorraine burst out laughing. The prince
understood how severe towards himself this opinion of the
Comte de Guiche was, and he looked somewhat displeased,
saying, &quot;My friends are not over indulgent.&quot; De Guiche
looked at the portrait again, and, after lengthened
contemplation, returned it with apparent unwillingness,
saying, &quot;Most decidedly, my lord, I should rather prefer to
look ten times at your highness, than to look at Madame once
again.&quot; It seemed as if the chevalier had detected some
mystery in these words, which were incomprehensible to the
prince, for he exclaimed: &quot;Very well, get married yourself.&quot;
Monsieur continued painting himself, and when he had
finished, looked at the portrait again once more, turned to
admire himself in the glass, and smiled, and no doubt was
satisfied with the comparison. &quot;You are very kind to have
come,&quot; he said to Guiche, &quot;I feared you would leave without
bidding me adieu.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your highness knows me too well to believe me capable of so
great a disrespect.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Besides, I suppose you have something to ask from me before
leaving Paris?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your highness has indeed guessed correctly, for I have a
request to make.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very good, what is it?&quot;</P>
<P>The Chevalier de Lorraine immediately displayed the greatest
attention, for he regarded every favor conferred upon
another as a robbery committed against himself. And, as
Guiche hesitated, the prince said: &quot;If it be money, nothing
could be more fortunate, for I am in funds; the
superintendent of the finances has sent me 500,000
pistoles.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I thank your highness; but it is not an affair of money.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is it, then? Tell me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The appointment of a maid of honor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! oh! Guiche, what a protector you have become of young
ladies,&quot; said the prince, &quot;you never speak of any one else
now!&quot;</P>
<P>The Chevalier de Lorraine smiled, for he knew very well that
nothing displeased the prince more than to show any interest
in ladies. &quot;My lord,&quot; said the comte, &quot;it is not I who am
directly interested in the lady of whom I have just spoken;
I am acting on behalf of one of my friends.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! that is different; what is the name of the young lady
in whom your friend is interested?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mlle. de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere; she is already
maid of honor to the dowager princess.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, she is lame,&quot; said the Chevalier de Lorraine,
stretching himself on his cushions.</P>
<P>&quot;Lame,&quot; repeated the prince, &quot;and Madame to have her
constantly before her eyes? Most certainly not; it may be
dangerous for her when in an interesting condition.&quot;</P>
<P>The Chevalier de Lorraine burst out laughing.</P>
<P>&quot;Chevalier,&quot; said Guiche, &quot;your conduct is ungenerous; while
I am soliciting a favor, you do me all the mischief you
can.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Forgive me, comte,&quot; said the Chevalier de Lorraine,
somewhat uneasy at the tone in which Guiche had made his
remark, &quot;but I had no intention of doing so, and I begin to
believe that I have mistaken one young lady for another.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is no doubt of it, monsieur; and I do not hesitate to
declare that such is the case.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you attach much importance to it, Guiche?&quot; inquired the
prince.</P>
<P>&quot;I do, my lord.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, you shall have it, but ask me for no more
appointments, for there are none to give away.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; exclaimed the chevalier, &quot;midday already, that is the
hour fixed for the departure.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You dismiss me, monsieur?&quot; inquired Guiche.</P>
<P>&quot;Really, count, you treat me very ill to-day,&quot; replied the
chevalier.</P>
<P>&quot;For heaven's sake, count, for heaven's sake, chevalier,&quot;
said Monsieur, &quot;do you not see how you are distressing me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your highness's signature?&quot; said Guiche.</P>
<P>&quot;Take a blank appointment from that drawer, and give it to
me.&quot; Guiche handed the prince the document indicated, and at
the same time presented him with a pen already dipped in
ink; whereupon the prince signed. &quot;Here,&quot; he said, returning
him the appointment, &quot;but I give it on one condition.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Name it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That you make friends with the chevalier.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Willingly,&quot; said Guiche. And he held out his hand to the
chevalier with an indifference amounting to contempt.</P>
<P>&quot;Adieu, count,&quot; said the chevalier, without seeming in any
way to have noticed the count's slight; &quot;adieu, and bring us
back a princess who will not talk with her own portrait too
much.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, set off and lose no time. By the by, who accompany
you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bragelonne and De Wardes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Both excellent and fearless companions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Too fearless,&quot; said the chevalier; &quot;endeavor to bring them
both back, count.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A bad heart, bad!&quot; murmured De Guiche; &quot;he scents mischief
everywhere, and sooner than anything else.&quot; And taking leave
of the prince, he quitted the apartment. As soon as he
reached the vestibule, he waved in the air the paper which
the prince had signed. Malicorne hurried forward, and
received it, trembling with delight. When, however, he held
it in his hand Guiche observed that he still awaited
something further.</P>
<P>&quot;Patience, monsieur,&quot; he said; &quot;the Chevalier de Lorraine
was there, and I feared an utter failure if I asked too much
at once. Wait until I return. Adieu.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Adieu, monsieur le comte; a thousand thanks,&quot; said
Malicorne.</P>
<P>&quot;Send Manicamp to me. By the way, monsieur, is it true that
Mlle. de la Valliere is lame?&quot; As he said this a horse drew
up behind him, and on turning round he noticed that
Bragelonne, who had just at that moment entered the
courtyard, turned suddenly pale. The poor lover had heard
the remark, which, however, was not the case with Malicorne,
for he was already beyond the reach of the count's voice.</P>
<P>&quot;Why is Louise's name spoken of here?&quot; said Raoul to
himself; &quot;oh! let not De Wardes, who stands smiling yonder,
even say a word about her in my presence.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now, gentlemen,&quot; exclaimed the Comte de Guiche, &quot;prepare to
start.&quot;</P>
<P>At this moment the prince, who had completed his toilette,
appeared at the window, and was immediately saluted by the
acclamations of all who composed the escort, and ten minutes
afterwards, banners, scarfs, and feathers were fluttering
and waving in the air, as the cavalcade galloped away.</P></div>
