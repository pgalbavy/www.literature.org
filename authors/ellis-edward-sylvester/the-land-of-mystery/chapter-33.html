<p>Haffgo, king of the Murhapas, intended to keep his promise to
Ziffak, so far as permitting the explorers to remain in his village
until the morrow, at which time he intended that the men should
be allowed to go in safety.</p>

<p>But the barbarian was very similar to some of us whose resentment
grows with reflection.  When he recalled the admiring glances
of the handsome young member of the company towards his beloved
Ariel, his anger became intense, fanned by the strong suspicion
that the princess herself felt some interest in the stranger.</p>

<p>At this critical time, Waggaman put in an appearance.  The ruffian
was shrewd enough to see his opportunity, and it took him but
a few minutes to rouse him to the exploding point.  He determined
that every one of the whites should die, and he ordered the assault
which has already been described.</p>

<p>As has been explained, the king kept within his home, while the
attack was under way; but since he resided adjoining the structure
which was assaulted, he was aware of every phase of the progress.</p>

<p>His rage has been hinted at because of the repulse of his warriors
directly under his own eyes; but when he came to learn that the
youth against whom his resentment burned so hotly was not within
the building; that the two who had fought so bravely had escaped
with their native helpers; that his own daughter the princess
was absent; that she had been seen fleeing with the white youth
in the direction of the enchanted lake:&mdash;when all this became
known to the ruler, it may be said that his fury was such that
no language could do it justice.  It is not impossible that the
despot felt thus himself, for, without pausing to give utterance
to a few of his imaginings, he made instant preparations to follow
the couple to the region which he never permitted a white man
to look upon.</p>

<p>A native woman had seen the princess pass up the side of the
river, followed a few minutes later by the young man.  Her curiosity
led her to watch them.  She saw the two meet and stand for some
time in loving converse.  Then one of the white men stole behind
them and was about to fire his dreadful weapon, when Ziffak hurled
his terrible javelin which pinned him to the ground.  Then the
native woman hastened to the palace to tell the news, but she
could not gain the chance for some time.</p>

<p>When the king turned upon his brother for an explanation of what
he had done, Ziffak was prepared.  It was the intention of Burkhardt
to shoot not the white man but the princess herself, because she
had refused his love.  He heard Burkhardt mutter those words to
himself and it was because of those words that Ziffak drove his
javelin through his body.</p>

<p>King Haffgo looked sharply at his kinsman when he made this unblushing
response, but his doubts if there were any quickly vanished, when
he recalled the impetuosity with which he had attacked the defenders
in the house and the vigor of his pursuit and his evident indignation
and chagrin at the escape of the two white men.  No, Ziffak might
talk plainly with his royal brother, but when the time for action
came he was a true Murhapa, who knew only his duty to his king.</p>

<p>Besides, the little flurry between the two had helped to clear
away the fogs of misunderstanding as the lightning often purifies
the murky atmosphere.  The pursuit of the lovers was quickly organized,
for they now occupied the thoughts of the king to the exclusion
of everything else.  Grimcke and Long could not be far off, and
a vigorous hunt was likely to discover one or both of them, but
the king gave orders that no attempt of the kind should be made. 
It was his intention to leave the village for an indefinite time,
and he wished every one of his warriors to remain while he was
absent.  It cannot be said that he was afraid of such an insignificant
force, but there was a strong vein of superstition in his nature,
which caused a vague fear of the men that had escaped him with
such wonderful cleverness.  Individuals who could do <em>that</em>
sort of thing, were capable of doing things still more marvellous,
and to use homely language, King Haffgo was taking no chances.</p>

<p>The party in pursuit numbered just ten persona including the
king, Ziffak, Waggaman, and the very pick of the tribe.  They
were all splendid fellows, fit to be the body-guard of a king,
who, when he laid aside the robes of cumbrous dress he was accustomed
to wear, and arrayed himself similarly to the warriors, proved
himself no mean leader of such a party.</p>

<p>Any one looking upon the little company would have been most
impressed by the fact that there were nine dusky barbarians, half
naked and as black as Africans, under the guidance of a man as
fair as any European; and yet, as the reader knows, the most prominent
warrior of the party was the brother of that king, dusky, tall
and a giant in stature.</p>

<p>A tribe living in a country as well watered as the Matto Grosso,
is sure to be well provided with the means of navigation, though
the explorers, when they first reached the neighborhood of the
rapids, deemed there was an unusual absence of such craft.  A
canoe, longer even than that used by our friends in ascending
from the Amazon, was carried a short distance down the bank and
launched in the Xingu.  Five of the warriors seized their long
paddles and swung them with the skill of veterans.  They were
accustomed to that kind of work, and sent the craft up the current
with much greater speed than would have been suspected, even by
those accustomed to see such work.</p>

<p>Two of the dusky occupants were furnished with bows and arrows,
while Waggaman carried his rifle.  Thus every species of weapon
known to the Murhapas was in the boat.</p>

<p>King Haffgo sat at the stern, his brow dark and threatening,
his arms folded and his lips set.  His thoughts were too deep
for utterance and no one ventured to disturb him.  Though the
pale countenance was outwardly calm, yet a volcano was raging
in that breast, hot and furious enough to burst out and consume
the barbarian.</p>

<p>Just in front of him, Ziffak was facing toward the prow, directing
the actions of the crew, though for a time little of that was
required of him.  Waggaman was at the prow, silent, glum, scowling. 
He did not speak for a long while, but, now and then, glanced
at Ziffak.  When he did so, he was pretty sure to find the black
eyes of the head chieftain fixed upon him.</p>

<p>The two thoroughly distrusted each other.  Waggaman knew why
that javelin had been driven through the body of his associate
and, though the convict felt little sorrow for the loss of his
companion, yet he hated the chieftain with a deadly hatred, well
aware as he was that the feeling was thoroughly reciprocated by
Ziffak.</p>

<p>Whether King Haffgo suspected the truth cannot be known, nor
is it of importance to know.  All the energy of his nature was
concentrated in the emotion of fury against Fred Ashman, who had
committed the unparalleled presumption of robbing him of his daughter;
and even against that lovely maiden he was so incensed that he
stood ready to bury his spear in her snowy bosom.</p>

<p>Though it may have seemed strange to Ashman that Ziffak had ordered
him to make all haste to the enchanted lake, instead of starting
on a direct flight through the woods, returning to the Xingu at
a lower point, yet the sagacious chieftain had the best of reasons
for his course, as will soon appear.</p>

<p>Had Ashman fled through the forest, the fact would have been
discovered at daybreak, if not before, and such a vigorous pursuit
would have been pressed as to render escape out of the question. 
There was a possibility of outwitting Haffgo by the flight to
the lake, though it was remote enough to cause the giant warrior
to shudder when he reflected upon it.</p>

<p>That which caused Ziffak regret was, that he had not paused long
enough before parting from the couple, to arrange a better understanding
with them.  As it was, he was mostly in the dark concerning their
movements, and greatly handicapped by the necessity of appearing
to be the devoted ally of his royal brother.</p>

<p>Under the powerful propulsion of the five paddles, the long narrow
canoe sped swiftly up the Xingu, and, sooner than even Ziffak
anticipated, it turned into the narrow stream leading to the enchanted
lake.  Along this it sped like a swallow until the huge rock with
its sentinel came in sight.</p>

<p>It was here that King Haffgo, for the first time, showed some
interest in his surroundings.  He scanned the massive rock closely
and manifestly was surprised that the guard did not rise to his
feet and challenge them.</p>

<p>Observing that the figure remained motionless, he commanded the
craft to approach the rock.  This was silently done, the boat
halting with the prow touching the mass of black stone.</p>

<p>Still the sentinel moved not, all unaware of his peril.  One
keen glance showed he was committing the unpardonable sin of sleeping
at his post.</p>

<p>Rising quickly to his feet, the king stood upright for an instant,
and then, with a furious exclamation, drove the javelin which
he snatched from the hands of one of the warriors through the
breast of the unfaithful servant, who uttered but a single groan
as he perished by the hands of his master and sovereign.</p>

<p>Then Haffgo commanded one of his men to take his place.  The
fellow instantly sprang from the boat and took his station on
the rock, as the successor of him who had died so ignominiously. 
Little fear of his falling asleep on his post.</p>

<p>A minute later the boat shot out upon the moonlit surface of
the enchanted lake.  There the occupants used their eyes for all
they were worth, the craft making a partial circuit of the sheet
of water.  There was a possibility that the fugitives were there,
though it was slight. Many places afforded a landing, where they
might have found temporary shelter, but nothing was seen of the
boat, and Haffgo ordered the oarsmen to pass through the tunnel
leading to the underground lake.</p>

<p>This was speedily effected, and the large boat debouched into
the wonderful body of water, so brilliantly illuminated by the
glare from the burning mountain on the western side.</p>

<p>Instinctively every eye was cast in that direction, but nothing
rewarded the scrutiny.  Then the vision swept along the shores,
every portion of which, as will be remembered, was in plain view.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment; Ziffak uttered an excited exclamation,
and pointed to the northern shore.  As the gaze of every one was
directed thither, they caught sight of the craft for which they
were so eagerly hunting.</p>
