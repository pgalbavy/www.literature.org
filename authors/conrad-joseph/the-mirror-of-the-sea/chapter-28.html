<p> The winds of North and South are, as I have said, but small
princes amongst the powers of the sea.  They have no territory
of their own; they are not reigning winds anywhere.  Yet it is
from their houses that the reigning dynasties which have shared
between them the waters of the earth are sprung.  All the weather
of the world is based upon the contest of the Polar and Equatorial
strains of that tyrannous race.  The West Wind is the greatest
king.  The East rules between the Tropics.  They have shared each
ocean between them.  Each has his genius of supreme rule. The
King of the West never intrudes upon the recognised dominion of
his kingly brother.  He is a barbarian, of a northern type.  Violent
without craftiness, and furious without malice, one may imagine
him seated masterfully with a double-edged sword on his knees
upon the painted and gilt clouds of the sunset, bowing his shock
head of golden locks, a flaming beard over his breast, imposing,
colossal, mighty-limbed, with a thundering voice, distended cheeks
and fierce blue eyes, urging the speed of his gales.  The other,
the East king, the king of blood-red sunrises, I represent to
myself as a spare Southerner with clear-cut features, black-browed
and dark-eyed, gray-robed, upright in sunshine, resting a smooth-shaven
cheek in the palm of his hand, impenetrable, secret, full of wiles,
fine-drawn, keen—meditating aggressions.</p>

<p>The West Wind keeps faith with his brother, the King of the Easterly
weather.  "What we have divided we have divided," he seems to
say in his gruff voice, this ruler without guile, who hurls as
if in sport enormous masses of cloud across the sky, and flings
the great waves of the Atlantic clear across from the shores of
the New World upon the hoary headlands of Old Europe, which harbours
more kings and rulers upon its seamed and furrowed body than all
the oceans of the world together. "What we have divided we have
divided; and if no rest and peace in this world have fallen to
my share, leave me alone.  Let me play at quoits with cyclonic
gales, flinging the discs of spinning cloud and whirling air from
one end of my dismal kingdom to the other: over the Great Banks
or along the edges of pack-ice—this one with true aim right into
the bight of the Bay of Biscay, that other upon the fiords of
Norway, across the North Sea where the fishermen of many nations
look watchfully into my angry eye.  This is the time of kingly
sport."</p>

<p>And the royal master of high latitudes sighs mightily, with the
sinking sun upon his breast and the double-edged sword upon his
knees, as if wearied by the innumerable centuries of a strenuous
rule and saddened by the unchangeable aspect of the ocean under
his feet—by the endless vista of future ages where the work of
sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind shall go on and on till
his realm of living waters becomes a frozen and motionless ocean. 
But the other, crafty and unmoved, nursing his shaven chin between
the thumb and forefinger of his slim and treacherous hand, thinks
deep within his heart full of guile: "Aha! our brother of the
West has fallen into the mood of kingly melancholy.  He is tired
of playing with circular gales, and blowing great guns, and unrolling
thick streamers of fog in wanton sport at the cost of his own
poor, miserable subjects.  Their fate is most pitiful.  Let us
make a foray upon the dominions of that noisy barbarian, a great
raid from Finisterre to Hatteras, catching his fishermen unawares,
baffling the fleets that trust to his power, and shooting sly
arrows into the livers of men who court his good graces.  He is,
indeed, a worthless fellow." And forthwith, while the West Wind
meditates upon the vanity of his irresistible might, the thing
is done, and the Easterly weather sets in upon the North Atlantic.</p>

<p>The prevailing weather of the North Atlantic is typical of the
way in which the West Wind rules his realm on which the sun never
sets.  North Atlantic is the heart of a great empire.  It is the
part of the West Wind’s dominions most thickly populated with
generations of fine ships and hardy men.  Heroic deeds and adventurous
exploits have been performed there, within the very stronghold
of his sway.  The best sailors in the world have been born and
bred under the shadow of his sceptre, learning to manage their
ships with skill and audacity before the steps of his stormy throne. 
Reckless adventurers, toiling fishermen, admirals as wise and
brave as the world has ever known, have waited upon the signs
of his westerly sky.  Fleets of victorious ships have hung upon
his breath.  He has tossed in his hand squadrons of war-scarred
three-deckers, and shredded out in mere sport the bunting of flags
hallowed in the traditions of honour and glory.  He is a good
friend and a dangerous enemy, without mercy to unseaworthy ships
and faint-hearted seamen.  In his kingly way he has taken but
little account of lives sacrificed to his impulsive policy; he
is a king with a double-edged sword bared in his right hand. 
The East Wind, an interloper in the dominions of Westerly weather,
is an impassive-faced tyrant with a sharp poniard held behind
his back for a treacherous stab.</p>

<p>In his forays into the North Atlantic the East Wind behaves like
a subtle and cruel adventurer without a notion of honour or fair
play.  Veiling his clear-cut, lean face in a thin layer of a hard,
high cloud, I have seen him, like a wizened robber sheik of the
sea, hold up large caravans of ships to the number of three hundred
or more at the very gates of the English Channel.  And the worst
of it was that there was no ransom that we could pay to satisfy
his avidity; for whatever evil is wrought by the raiding East
Wind, it is done only to spite his kingly brother of the West. 
We gazed helplessly at the systematic, cold, gray-eyed obstinacy
of the Easterly weather, while short rations became the order
of the day, and the pinch of hunger under the breast-bone grew
familiar to every sailor in that held-up fleet.  Every day added
to our numbers.  In knots and groups and straggling parties we
flung to and fro before the closed gate.  And meantime the outward-bound
ships passed, running through our humiliated ranks under all the
canvas they could show.  It is my idea that the Easterly Wind
helps the ships away from home in the wicked hope that they shall
all come to an untimely end and be heard of no more.  For six
weeks did the robber sheik hold the trade route of the earth,
while our liege lord, the West Wind, slept profoundly like a tired
Titan, or else remained lost in a mood of idle sadness known only
to frank natures. All was still to the westward; we looked in
vain towards his stronghold: the King slumbered on so deeply that
he let his foraging brother steal the very mantle of gold-lined
purple clouds from his bowed shoulders. What had become of the
dazzling hoard of royal jewels exhibited at every close of day? 
Gone, disappeared, extinguished, carried off without leaving a
single gold band or the flash of a single sunbeam in the evening
sky!  Day after day through a cold streak of heavens as bare and
poor as the inside of a rifled safe a rayless and despoiled sun
would slink shamefacedly, without pomp or show, to hide in haste
under the waters.  And still the King slept on, or mourned the
vanity of his might and his power, while the thin-lipped intruder
put the impress of his cold and implacable spirit upon the sky
and sea.  With every daybreak the rising sun had to wade through
a crimson stream, luminous and sinister, like the spilt blood
of celestial bodies murdered during the night.</p>

<p>In this particular instance the mean interloper held the road
for some six weeks on end, establishing his particular administrative
methods over the best part of the North Atlantic.  It looked as
if the easterly weather had come to stay for ever, or, at least,
till we had all starved to death in the held-up fleet—starved
within sight, as it were, of plenty, within touch, almost, of
the bountiful heart of the Empire. There we were, dotting with
our white dry sails the hard blueness of the deep sea.  There
we were, a growing company of ships, each with her burden of grain,
of timber, of wool, of hides, and even of oranges, for we had
one or two belated fruit schooners in company.  There we were,
in that memorable spring of a certain year in the late seventies,
dodging to and fro, baffled on every tack, and with our stores
running down to sweepings of bread-lockers and scrapings of sugar-casks. 
It was just like the East Wind’s nature to inflict starvation
upon the bodies of unoffending sailors, while he corrupted their
simple souls by an exasperation leading to outbursts of profanity
as lurid as his blood-red sunrises.  They were followed by gray
days under the cover of high, motionless clouds that looked as
if carved in a slab of ash-coloured marble.  And each mean starved
sunset left us calling with imprecations upon the West Wind even
in its most veiled misty mood to wake up and give us our liberty,
if only to rush on and dash the heads of our ships against the
very walls of our unapproachable home.</p>
