<p>Young Munson was destined to learn ultimately that he had undertaken
an impossible task. The hunter, in the flush and excitement attending
the pursuit of game, can form no correct idea of the distance
passed, and so he, in attempting to run the shadowy wolf to earth,
had traveled twice as far as he supposed. The case is altogether
different when the hunter starts to return. It is then that the
furlongs become miles, and the wearied pursuer feels disgusted
with the enthusiasm which led him so far away from headquarters.</p>

<p>When the lad was certain that he had labored far enough on the
back track to take him fully to the camp-fire, he really had not
gone more than one-half the distance. Worse than this, he saw,
from the nature of the ground, that he was "off soundings." Several
times he was forced to leap over openings, or rents, similar to
that into which he had stumbled, and the broadening out of the
cave made it out of his power to confine his path to anything
like reasonable limits. The appearance of unexpected obstructions
directly in his way compelled numerous detours, with the inevitable
result of disarranging the line he intended to pursue, and causing
his course to be a zigzag one of the most marked character.</p>

<p>There were no landmarks to afford him the least guidance. In
short, he was like the ill-fated steamer caught on a dangerous
coast by an impenetrable fog, where no observations can be made,
and the captain is compelled to "go it blind." He was forcibly
reminded of this difficulty by unexpectedly finding himself face
to face with the side of the cavern. When he thought that he was
pursuing the right direction, here was evidence that he was at
least going at right angles, and, to all intents and purposes,
he might as well have been going in exactly the opposite course.</p>

<p>"Well, things are getting mixed," he exclaimed, more amused than
frightened at this discovery. "I never tramped over such a place
before, and if I ever get out of this, I'll never try it again."</p>

<p>But there was little cause for mirth, and when he had struggled
an hour longer, something like despair began to creep into his
heart. Worse than all, he became aware that his torch was nearly
exhausted, and, under the most favorable circumstances, could
not last more than an hour longer.</p>

<p>While toiling in this manner, he had continued to signal to Mickey
in his usual manner, but with no other result than that of awakening
the same deafening din of echoes. By this time he was utterly
worn out. He had been traveling for hours, or, rather, working,
for nearly every step was absolute labor, so precipitous was the
ground and so frequent were his detours. He had accomplished nothing.
When he expected to find himself in the immediate vicinity of
the campfire, there were no signs of it, and the loudest shout
he could make to his friend brought no reply.</p>

<p>This fact filled the mind of Fred with a hundred misgivings.
He had given up the belief that it was possible for Mickey to
remain asleep all this time. He was sure the night had passed,
and, great as was the capacity of the Irishman in the way of slumber,
he could not remain unconscious all the time. And then nothing
seemed more probable than that he was placed for ever beyond the
power of response. If a dozen Indians quietly let themselves down
through the opening during the darkness of the night, they could
easily discover the sleeping figure, and dispatch him before he
could make any kind of resistance.</p>

<p>It was this fear of the Indians being in the cave that made the
lad apprehensive every time he gave utterance to his signals.
He believed they were as likely to reach the ears of the Apaches
as those of Mickey, and his faith of the extraordinary shrewdness
of those people was such that he did not doubt but that, by some
means or other, they would learn the true signal with which to
reply. As yet, however, no such attempt had been made, so far
as his ears informed him, but his misgivings were none the less
on that account. What was the use of their taking the trouble
to answer when he was walking directly into their hands? There
was a cowering, shrinking sensation from his own noise, caused
by the expectation that a half-dozen crouching figures would leap
up and swoop down upon him.</p>

<p>The darkness remained impenetrable, and, as Fred toiled forward,
he was continually recalling the words of Byron, which he had
read frequently when at school, and had learned to recite for
his father. He found himself repeating them, and there was no
doubt that he realized more vividly than do boys generally of
his age the meaning of the author:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"The world was void:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The populous and powerful was a lump,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A lump of death, a chaos of hard clay.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rivers, lakes and ocean, all stood still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing stirr'd within their silent depths."

</p>
</div>
<p>Such fancies as these were not calculated to make him feel particularly
comfortable while carrying the torch. Such a person in such a
situation makes an especially inviting target of himself, and,
although Fred dreaded to see it burn itself out, when the chances
were that he was likely to be in sore need of the same, yet he
had wrought himself up to such a pitch that he more than once
meditated extinguishing it altogether, with the purpose of putting
himself on an equality with those of his enemies who might be
prowling in the night around him.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether Mickey would be more likely to hear my pistol
than a shout or whistle?" he said, as he drew the weapon from
his belt and held it up to inspect it in the light of the flaring
torch. "It seems to be all right, although there's no telling
how long since it has been loaded. Here goes."</p>

<p>With this, he pointed the muzzle toward the cavern and pulled
the trigger.</p>

<p>The response was as prompt as though he had charged the chamber
but a short time before, proving not only that the weapon was
of the best quality, but that the ammunition was equally so, and
the slight moisture that characterized the atmosphere of the cave
had not been sufficient to injure the charge. It seemed as if
he had fired a cannon, the echoes rolling, doubling, and repeating
on themselves in the most bewildering and terrifying fashion.</p>

<p>Fred could not understand how it was that such a pandemonium
of sound could escape filling the subterranean world from one
end to the other, and so he sat down on a ledge of rock to listen
for some reply from his friend.</p>

<p>It was several seconds before the trickeries of nature, in the
way of echoes, terminated and matters settled down to their natural
quiet. And then, when quiet came again, it was like that of a
tomb&mdash;deep, profound, and impressive. The bent and listening ear
could detect nothing that could be supposed to resemble the noise
of the cascade, which had excited his wonder when he was stretched
out upon the ground directly above it.</p>

<p>"This must be about forty miles round," he said to himself, when
he had waited for the reply until convinced that it was not forthcoming,
"and I have strayed away altogether."</p>

<p>The luxury of rest was so great, after his long, wearying toil,
that he concluded that he might as well spend a half hour in that
fashion as in any other. The echoes and pains of his bruises had
departed,&mdash;or, more properly, perhaps they were consolidated with
the aches and pains following upon the overtaxing of his limbs.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! How tired I am!" he sighed, as he stretched out his
limbs. "It seems to me that I won't be able to walk again for
a week. I must rest awhile."</p>

<p>His fatigue was so great that he was not conscious of any desire
for food or rest.</p>

<p>"Maybe I will need that torch more after a time than I do now,"
he added, as he looked listlessly at it. "It seems good for a
half hour yet, and I don't want it." With this he thrust the burning
end in the sand at his feet, and held it there until it was entirely
extinguished, and he was wrapped again in the same impenetrable
darkness. So far as possible, he had become accustomed to this
dreadful state of affairs. He had been viewing and breathing the
atmospheric blackness for many hours, although it may be doubted
whether one who had spent so much of his life in the sunshine
could ever become accustomed to the total deprivation of it.</p>

<p>Fred had assumed an easy position, where he could lay his head
back, and, straightening out his legs, he made up his mind to
enjoy the rest which he needed so badly. When a lad is thoroughly
and completely tired, it is difficult for him to think of anything
else; and although, while walking, the fugitive was tormented
by all manner of wild fancies and fears, yet when his efforts
ceased, something like a reaction followed, and he sighed for
rest, content to wait until he should be forced to face the difficulties
again.</p>

<p>When he closed his eyes all sorts of lights danced before him,
and strange, indescribable noises filled the air. It seemed that
impish figures were frolicking all around, sometimes grinning
in his face, and then skurrying far away through the aisles of
the gloom. At last he slept. The slumber was sweet and dreamless,
carrying him through the entire night, and affording him the very
rest and refreshment which he so sorely needed.</p>

<p>This sleep was nearly completed when Fred was aroused by some
animal licking his face. He arose with a start of exclamation
and terror, and the animal growled and darted back several feet.
A pair of gleaming eyes flashed in the darkness&mdash;the same pair
which he had seen before. The wolf had come back to him.</p>

<p>Fred drew his revolver with the purpose of giving him a shot,
when he reflected that it would be wisdom not to kill the animal
until he was forced to do it in self defense. So he shoved the
weapon back in its place, where it could be seized at a moment's
warning, and sat still. In a few moments the wolf ventured softly
up to him, and preparing to begin his feast. The boy, yielding
to a strange whim, threw out his arms and made a grab at him.</p>

<p>The affrighted creature made a leap to escape the embrace, and
Fred grasped his tail with both hands. This made the wolf wild
with terror, and away he leaped. The boy hung on, running with
might and main in his efforts to keep up. The brute, not knowing
what he had in tow, was only intent upon getting away, and he
plunged ahead as furiously as if a blazing torch was tied to his
tail. Fred was fully imbued with the "spirit of the occasion,"
and resolved not to part company with his guide, unless the caudal
appendage should detach itself from its owner. The wolf was naturally
much more fleet of foot, but his efforts of speed only increased
that of the lad, who, still clinging to his support, labored with
might and main.</p>

<p>Away, away they went!</p>

<p>Now he was down on his knees; then clambering up again; then
banging against the rocks&mdash;still onward, until he found himself
flat on his face, still holding to his support, while the wolf
was clutching and clawing to get away. They were in such a narrow
passage way that Fred could not rise. Unclasping one hand, he
held on with the other, while he worked along after him. For a
long time this savage scratching, struggling and toiling continued,
and then, all at once, Fred was dazzled by the overpowering flood
of light.</p>

<p>He had escaped from the cave in the mountain, and was in the
outside world again.</p>
