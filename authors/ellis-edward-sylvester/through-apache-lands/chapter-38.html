<p>The Apaches surrounding Hurricane Hill were more closely watched
through the forenoon, for Dick more than once gave it as his opinion
that they would make a rush before the day was over. To protect
themselves as much as possible, the rock of which the hunter had
spoken was forced into the passage-way, and an unremitting guard
maintained, to prevent any sudden surprise.</p>

<p>It was near noon, when three Apaches were seen to leap upon their
mustangs, one going north, another south and the third due west.</p>

<p>"Spies," explained Dick. "Lone Wolf is a little anxious about
what Tom may do, and he sends them out to watch. If they find
out anythin' they'll manage to telegraph him in time to get ready
for anythin' comin'."</p>

<p>"Can you see Lone Wolf among them?"</p>

<p>"Can't make sartin of it," returned the hunter. "He knows that
if I can get a crack at him he'll go, and so he takes care not
to let me have the chance. Can you see anythin' off toward the
mountains in the west?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but that Apache horseman going away like an arrow."</p>

<p>"There's the p'int from which our friends will come, if they
ever come at all. Keep your eye on it while I take a look below."</p>

<p>The scout moved down the declivity, until he reached the place
where it had been barricaded, when he stationed himself behind
the obstruction, quite certain that something stirring would soon
take place. It was his belief that when the time came, the Apaches,
at a preconcerted signal, would rush tumultuously up the steep
in a determined effort to overwhelm them all. Such a movement,
of course, from the very nature of things, would give timely notice
of its coming. His astonishment, therefore, may be imagined when,
after he had stood in his position for a few minutes, rather listlessly
and looking for no immediate demonstration, he perceived a dark
body suddenly pass over his head. Turning about, he saw an Indian
warrior speeding like a deer up the path toward the top of Hurricane
Hill, where Ned Chadmund stood, all unconscious of his coming.</p>

<p>The hunter, astonished as he was at the daring feat, was not
thrown off his guard. He knew that the Apache was not seeking
the life of the lad, but only to open the way for the rest of
the warriors to follow over the barricade. They believed that
in the excitement Dick would turn and dash after the redskin,
leaving the way open for the whole horde to swarm to the top of
the Hill. But the clear-headed Dick maintained his position, only
uttering a shout of warning to Ned Chadmund, in the hope that
he might be prepared and "wing" the redskin the instant he should
appear in view. Then, having done this, he stood back behind the
jutting rock and held his rifle ready.</p>

<p>Within ten seconds a second Apache scrambled over the barricade,
and started at full speed up the pathway, but he had no more than
fairly started, than he fell headlong to the ground, pierced through
and through by the rifle fired almost in his face. Almost the
same instant a second appeared, when he tumbled backward, driven
thence by the revolver of the hunter, who was as cool as an iceberg.
This stemmed the tide, the crowding warriors hurrying back before
the lion that lay in their path. All this was the work of a very
few seconds, but it was scarcely effected, when a cry from the
lad on top of the rock showed that he had discovered his danger.
The next instant, white-faced and scared, he came dashing down
the path, shouting to the hunter:</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick, save me! save me! there's an Indian after me!"</p>

<p>The savage, however, did not follow, and Dick, as the lad rushed
into his arms, shook him rather roughly, and said:</p>

<p>"Keep still! Why do you make such a thunderin' noise?" The lad
speedily controlled himself, and then the scout placed his revolver
in his hand, and said: "Stand right here, and the minute a redskin
shows himself, crack him over. Can you do it?"</p>

<p>"Haven't I proved it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but you made such a racket here that I've lost faith in
you."</p>

<p>"Try me and see."</p>

<p>Adding a few hasty words, the scout left him, and hurried to
the top of the hill, without pausing to approach with his usual
precaution.</p>

<p>His expectation was to encounter the redskin at once upon reaching
it, but, to his surprise, he was nowhere to be seen, and he paused
somewhat bewildered.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he's got scart 'cause none of the rest followed
him, and jumped overboard&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant something descended like a ponderous rock, and
he realized that he was in the grip of the very redskin about
whom he had been meditating. The miscreant had managed to crouch
behind a rocky protuberance, and then made a sudden leap upon
the shoulders of the hunter. As the Apache's scheme had miscarried
thus far, and instead of being backed up by the other warriors,
he was left alone to fight it out, he did not pause to attempt
to make him prisoner, but went into the scrimmage with the purpose
of ending it as briefly as possible. As he landed upon the shoulders
of Dick the latter caught the gleam of his knife, and grasped
his wrist just in time. Fearful that it would be wrenched from
him, the Apache managed to give his confined hand a flirt, which
threw it beyond the reach of both. By a tremendous effort Dick
then succeeded in flinging him over his shoulder, although the
agile redskin dropped upon his feet, and instantly flew at his
antagonist like a tiger.</p>

<p>For several minutes the struggle raged with the greatest fury;
but the Apache, in a contest of this kind, was overmatched. The
hunter was much the superior, and he began crowding his foe toward
the margin of the rock. Divining his purpose, he resisted with
the fury of desperation; but it was useless, and the two moved
along toward the brink like the slow, resistless tread of fate.
Neither of them spoke a word, nor was a muscle relaxed. The scout
knew that the instant the struggle was detected by those below,
there would be a rush up the incline such as Ned Chadmund with
his loaded and cocked revolver could not withstand. The fighting,
therefore, was of the hurricane order from the beginning to the
close.</p>

<p>There was one terrific burst of strength, and then, gathering
the writhing savage in his arms, Dick Morris ran to the very edge
of the plateau and hurled him over.</p>

<p>Down, down from dizzy heights he spun, until he struck the ground
far below, a shapeless, insensible mass, falling almost at the
feet of the horror-bound Apaches, who thus saw the dreadful death
of one of their most intrepid and powerful warriors.</p>

<p>Without waiting to see the last of the redskin, the scout turned
and hurried down to the relief of his young charge, and to be
prepared for the rush which he was confident would be made the
next minute. But it was not. The redskins had learned, from dear
experience, the mettle of this formidable white man, and they
had no wish to encounter it again.</p>

<p>The time wore away until the sun was at the meridian, and the
heat became almost intolerable. Even the toughened old scout was
compelled to shelter himself as best he could from its intolerable
rays, by seeking the scant shadow of jutting points of the rock.
Ned Chadmund suffered much, and the roiled and warm water in the
old canteen was quaffed again, even though they were compelled
to tip it more and more, until, toward the close of the day, Dick
held it mouth downward, and showed that not a drop was left.</p>

<p>"No use of keeping it when we are thirsty," was the philosophic
remark of the hunter. "It's made to drink, and we needn't stop
so long as any is left; and bein' there ain't any left, I guess
we'll stop. I've a mouthful or two of meat left, and we may as
well surround that."</p>

<p>So they did; and when the sun sank down in the west, not a particle
of food nor a drop of water remained to them.</p>

<p>"Now, Ned, my boy," said Dick, who always maintained a certain
cheerfulness, no matter what the circumstances might be, "go to
the lookout and tell me what you see."</p>

<p>The lad was absent some ten minutes, during which he carefully
scanned every part of the horizon and took a peep down upon their
besiegers.</p>

<p>"I find no sign of a living soul," he said, when he returned,
"except the Apaches, and they're waiting until they can get us
without fighting."</p>

<p>"Stay here while I take a peep."</p>

<p>Long and carefully Dick Morris gazed off to the west, in the
direction of the mountains, and then something like a sigh escaped
him, as he shook his head and muttered:</p>

<p>"It looks bad, it looks bad. If Tom succeeded, he ought to be
in sight by this time. I see nothing of 'em, and from the way
the redskins act down there, they seem to be sartin he's gone
under. I don't mind for myself, for I'm ready to go any time;
but I feel powerful sorry for the little fellow down there."</p>
