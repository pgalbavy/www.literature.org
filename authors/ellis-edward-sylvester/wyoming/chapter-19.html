<p>Fortunately both Gravity Gimp and Mr. Brainerd knew the peculiar
construction of their refuge, and instant precautions were taken.</p>

<p>"Keep back as far as you can," said the elder, "and stay close
to the wall on the right."</p>

<p>His order was obeyed, Habakkuk McEwen and the African both moving
in that direction.</p>

<p>"You come too, papa," insisted Eva, catching hold of the arm
of her father, who smilingly took a step or two.</p>

<p>"Yes," added Maggie, "if we all place ourselves beyond reach,
why should not <em>you</em> do the same?"</p>

<p>He explained the situation.</p>

<p>"If the Indians get to that mass of rocks opposite, they can
shelter themselves and shoot into the cavern until there is not
one of us left."</p>

<p>"But is it necessary for you to stay out there, and draw their
fire to keep them away from us?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, but we must see that they do not creep to the spot;
before doing so, they must pass under our aim, and it will require
no great marksmanship to prevent them."</p>

<p>Thereupon, directing Gravity and Habakkuk to keep strict watch
upon the place, with their rifles cocked, Mr. Brainerd deliberately
reloaded his gun, and shifting his position so as to screen himself
from the bullets that were certain to be sent into the place,
he sat like a cat watching for a rat to come out of its hole.</p>

<p>The fugitives talked in low tones, for there was something in
the uncertainty that was impressive.</p>

<p>Now that they were removed from imminent danger, they could breathe
with some satisfaction, though sobered by their peril.</p>

<p>"It's all that Jake Golcher's doings," said Aunt Peggy, who was
at the extreme rear of the cavern, with one arm around the neck
of Eva and the other inclosing that of Maggie.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if you are right," replied Maggie; "he must
be a wicked man indeed."</p>

<p>"Umph!" exclaimed the maiden, with a sniff, "there ain't a more
scand'lous villain that ever drawed the breath of life, and I
know what I'm saying, and jus' to think, you had a chance and
didn't shoot him."</p>

<p>"But, aunty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shet up, don't interrupt me," broke in the relative, with a
vigorous shake of the arm inclosing the neck of Maggie.</p>

<p>"How many times have I told you not to interrupt me when I am
talking? Don't you know what's good manners?"</p>

<p>"But, aunty," said Maggie, softly, "I don't see how I can talk
at <em>any</em> time without interrupting you."</p>

<p>Eva giggled, but fortunately Aunt Peggy did not catch the full
meaning of the demure remark, and she said, rather sharply:</p>

<p>"It's easy enough to tell when I'm talking by just listening,
and when I'm talking you must keep still; but I want you to remember
that that piece of burglary on your part has got to be settled."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, aunty?"</p>

<p>"I told you you deserved your ears cuffed, and when we get to
a place where I can do it with some comfort to myself, I am going
to cuff them, <em>that</em> you can depend on."</p>

<p>There could be no question about the earnestness of these words,
and Maggie, like an obedient child, said nothing, glad to await
the time when her aunt should punish her for sparing the wretch
who was now trying to hound them to their death.</p>

<p>"I don't know but that I deserve it," said the niece to herself,
and we may as well confess that we are inclined to agree with
the views of the aunt.</p>

<p>"Oh, that Jake Golcher," she added, with a shiver, "I'd like
to get a chance at him!"</p>

<p>And just then she would have made it uncomfortable for the Tory,
had he been within reach.</p>

<p>The truth was, Golcher was one of the worst of the invaders of
Wyoming Valley. Like many others, he joined a horde of Indians
in attacking his former neighbors.</p>

<p>As we have intimated, he had sat at the same table with the Brainerds&mdash;he
had been given money by Mr. Brainerd himself, for he was a shiftless
scamp, hating work like a veritable tramp, and he had never received
an unkind word from the charitable head of the household, who
sheltered him many a time when no one else would give him room.</p>

<p>With the egotism of his nature, he had ventured to pay court
to young Maggie Brainerd, who could scarcely credit his effrontery
until he made a direct proposal of marriage.</p>

<p>Even then, the high-spirited girl was so touched with compassion
for the man, that she refused him with all the kindness of her
nature&mdash;showing a feeling, indeed, that would have won the respect
of any person claiming to be a man.</p>

<p>But he stumped off muttering vengeance, and here he was, less
then a year later, with a company of red men, seeking the lives
of his former friends.</p>

<p>Among those who figured in the war of the Revolution, there were
none so utterly inexcusable as the Tories, who, like all renegades,
were more bitter in the warfare they made upon the American colonies,
than were what might be termed our natural enemies.</p>

<p>But for the Jake Golcher named, it may be doubted whether the
little band of fugitives would have suffered serious disturbance
after fording and swimming the Susquehanna.</p>

<p>There was enough on the western bank to keep the foe occupied
all that night and the succeeding day, without crossing to the
wilderness to hunt for victims.</p>
