<p>Bare-headed, tangle-haired, his clothes torn, no collar, blood on his
shirt, on his hands, on his face, blood everywhere, a wound in his neck,
another on his lip, unrecognizable, horrible to look at, but magnificent
in energy, heroic and triumphant: such was the appearance presented by
old Morestal.
</p><p>He chortled:
</p><p>"Here!" he shouted.
</p><p>An enormous laugh rolled from under his moustache:
</p><p>"Morestal? Here!... Morestal, for the second time, a prisoner of the
Teuton ... and, for the second time, free!"
</p><p>Philippe stared at him in dismay, as though at an apparition.
</p><p>"Well, sonny? Is that the way you welcome me home?"
</p><p>He caught hold of a napkin and wiped his face with a great, wide
gesture. Then he drew his wife to him:
</p><p>"Kiss me, mother!... And you, Philippe! And you, Marthe!... And you
too, my pretty Suzanne: once for myself and once for your father!...
Don't cry, my child.... Daddy's all right.... They're coddling him like
an emperor, over there ... until they let him go. And that's not far
off. By Heaven, no! I hope the French government ..."
</p><p>He was talking like a drunken man, too fast and in an unsteady voice.
His wife tried to make him sit down. He protested:
</p><p>"Rest? Quite unnecessary, mother. A Morestal never rests. My wounds?
Scratches! What? The doctor? If he sets foot in this house, I'll chuck
him out of the window!"
</p><p>"Still, you ought to take something...."
</p><p>"Take something? A glass of wine, if you like ... a glass of good French
wine.... That's it, uncork a bottle.... We'll have a glass all round....
Your health, Weisslicht!... Oh, what a joke!... When I think of the face
of Weisslicht, the special commissary of the imperial government!... The
prisoner's gone! The bird's flown!"
</p><p>He laughed loudly and, after drinking two glasses of wine, one on top of
the other, he kissed the three women once more, kissed Philippe, called
in Victor, Catherine, the gardener, shook hands with them, sent them
away again and began to walk up and down the room, saying:
</p><p>"No time to be lost, children! I met the sergeant of gendarmes on the
Saint-Élophe road. The authorities have been informed.... They can be
here within half an hour. I want to present a report. Take a pen,
Philippe."
</p><p>"What's much more important," protested his wife, "is that you should
not excite yourself like this. Here, tell us all about it instead, quite
calmly."
</p><p>Old Morestal was never known to refuse to talk. He therefore began his
story, in short, slow sentences, as she wished, describing all the
details of attack and all the incidents of the journey to Börsweilen.
But, carried away once more, he raised his voice, grew indignant, worked
himself into a rage, burst into sarcasm:
</p><p>"Oh, they showed no lack of civility!... It was, 'Monsieur le
commissaire spécial!... Monsieur le conseiller d'arrondissement!'...
Weisslicht had his mouth crammed with our titles!... All the same, at
one o'clock in the morning, we were safely locked up in two nice little
rooms in the town-hall at Börsweilen.... In quod, what!... With a
probable indictment for complicity, espionage, high treason and the
devil knows what hanging over our heads!... Only, in that case,
gentlemen, you should not carry politeness so far as to release your
captives from their handcuffs; and the windows of your cells ought not
to be closed with bars too slight to be of any use; and you ought not to
let one of your prisoners keep his pocket-knife. If you do, as long as
that prisoner has any grit in him--and a file to his knife, by Jove!--he
will try what he can do. And I did try, by Jingo! At four o'clock in the
morning, after cutting the window-pane and filing or loosening four of
the bars, old Morestal let himself down by a waste-pipe and took to his
heels. Kind friends, farewell!... It was now only a question of getting
home.... The Col du Diable? The Albern Woods? The Butte-aux-Loups? No
such fool! The vermin were bound to be swarming on that side.... And, in
fact, I heard the drums beating and the trumpets sounding the alarm and
the horses galloping. They were hunting for me, of course!... But how
could they have thought of hunting for me six miles away, in the Val de
Sainte-Marie, right in the middle of the Forest of Arzance? And I
trotted ... I trotted until I was simply done.... I crossed the border
at eight o'clock, unseen and unknown. Morestal's foot was on his native
heath! At ten o'clock, I saw the steeple of Saint-Élophe from the
Côte-Blanche and I cut straight across, so as to get home quicker. And
here I am! A bit tired, I admit, but quite presentable.... Well, what do
you say to old Morestal now, eh?"
</p><p>He had stood up and, forgetting all about the fatigue of the night, was
enlivening his discourse with a savage display of gesture which alarmed
his wife.
</p><p>"And my poor father was not able to escape?" asked Suzanne.
</p><p>"No, they had taken care to search him," replied Morestal. "Besides,
they watched him more closely than they did me ... so he could not do as
I did...." And he added. "And a good job too! For I should have been
left to languish in their prisons until the end of an interminable
trial; whereas he, in forty-eight hours ... But this is all talk. The
authorities can't be far away. I want to have my report ready. There are
certain things which I suspect ... the business was a plot from start to
finish...."
</p><p>He interrupted himself, as though startled by an unexpected thought, and
sat for a long time motionless, with his head in his hands. Then,
suddenly, he struck the table with his fist:
</p><p>"That's it! I understand the whole thing now! Upon my word, it's taken
me long enough!"
</p><p>"What?" asked his wife.
</p><p>"Dourlowski, of course!"
</p><p>"Dourlowski?"
</p><p>"Why, yes! From the first minute, I guessed that it was a trap, a trap
contrived by inferior police-agents. But how was it laid? I see it now.
Dourlowski came here yesterday, on some pretext or other. He knew that
Jorancé and I would take the frontier-road in the evening; and the
passing of the deserter was contrived to take place at that moment, in
connivance with the German detectives! One of them whistles as soon as
we come up; and the soldier, who has been told, of course, that this
whistle is a signal from the French accomplices, the soldier, whom
Dourlowski or his confederates hold in a leash, like a dog, the soldier
is let go. That's the whole mystery! It was not he, the poor wretch,
whom they were after, but Jorancé and Morestal. Morestal, right enough,
flies to the rescue of the fugitive. They collar him, they lay hold of
Jorancé; and there we are, accomplices both. Bravo, gentlemen! Well
played!"
</p><p>Mme. Morestal murmured:
</p><p>"But, I say, it might be a serious thing ..."
</p><p>"For Jorancé," he replied, "yes, because he is in custody; only--there
is an 'only'--the pursuit of the deserter took place on French soil. We
also were arrested on French soil. It was a flagrant violation of the
frontier. So there's nothing to be afraid of."
</p><p>"You think so?" asked Suzanne. "You think that my father ...?"
</p><p>"Nothing to be afraid of," repeated Morestal. And he declared,
positively, "I look upon Jorancé as free."
</p><p>"Tut, tut!" mumbled the old lady. "Things won't go so fast as that."
</p><p>"Once more, I look upon Jorancé as free and for this good reason, that
the frontier has been violated."
</p><p>"Who will prove the violation?"
</p><p>"Who? Why, I, of course!... And Jorancé!... Do you think they'll doubt
the word of honest men like us? Besides, there are other proofs. They
will find the traces of the pursuit, the traces of the attack, the
traces of the stand which we made. And who can tell? There may have been
witnesses...."
</p><p>Marthe turned her eyes on Philippe. He was listening to his father, with
a face so pale that she was astounded. She waited for a few seconds and
then, seeing that he did not speak, she said:
</p><p>"There was a witness."
</p><p>Morestal started:
</p><p>"What's that, Marthe?"
</p><p>"Philippe was there."
</p><p>"Nonsense! We left Philippe at the Carrefour du Grand-Chêne, at the
bottom of the hill, didn't we, Suzanne? You remained behind together."
</p><p>Philippe intervened, quickly:
</p><p>"Suzanne went off at once! and so did I ... but I had not gone two
hundred yards when I turned back."
</p><p>"So that was why you did not answer when I called to you, half-way up
the hill?"
</p><p>"I expect so. I went back to the Grand-Chêne."
</p><p>"What for?"
</p><p>"To join you.... I was sorry I had left you."
</p><p>"Then you were behind us at the time of the attack?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"In that case, of course, you heard the shots fired!... Let me see, you
must have been on the Butte-aux-Loups...."
</p><p>"Somewhere near there...."
</p><p>"And perhaps you saw us.... From above!... With the moonlight!..."
</p><p>"Oh, no!" protested Philippe. "No, I saw nothing!"
</p><p>"But, if you heard the firing, you must certainly have heard Jorancé
shouting.... They stuffed a gag into my mouth.... But Jorancé kept on
roaring, 'We are in France! We are on French territory!' You heard
Jorancé shouting, didn't you, now?"
</p><p>Philippe hesitated before making a reply of which he vaguely felt the
tremendous importance. But, opposite him, he saw Marthe watching him
with increasing surprise and, near Marthe, he saw Suzanne's drawn
features. He said:
</p><p>"Yes, I heard him ... I heard him at a distance...."
</p><p>Old Morestal could not contain himself for joy. And, when he learnt
besides that Philippe had received the last words of Baufeld the
deserter, he burst out:
</p><p>"You saw him? He was alive? He told you that they had set a trap for us,
didn't he?"
</p><p>"He mentioned the name of Dourlowski."
</p><p>"Capital! But our meeting with the soldier, the pursuit ... he must have
told you that all this took place in France?"
</p><p>"Yes, I seemed to understand ..."
</p><p>"We've got them!" shouted Morestal. "We've got them! Of course, I was
quite easy in my mind.... But all the same, Philippe's evidence, the
declaration of the dying private.... Ah, the brigands, they'll have to
let go their prey!... We were in France, kind friends! There has been a
violation of the frontier!"
</p><p>Philippe saw that he had gone too far; and he objected:
</p><p>"My evidence is not evidence in the proper sense of the word.... As for
the soldier, I could hardly make out ..."
</p><p>"We've got them, I tell you. The little that you were able to see, the
little that you were able to hear all agrees with my own evidence, that
is to say, with the truth. We've got them! And here come the gentlemen
from the public prosecutor's office, who will be of my opinion, I bet
you what you like! And it won't take long either! Jorancé will be free
to-morrow."
</p><p>He dropped the pen, which he had taken up in order to write his report
himself, and went quickly to the window, attracted by the sound of a
motor-car sweeping round the garden-lawn:
</p><p>"The sub-prefect," he said. "By Jove, so the government know about it!
The examining-magistrate and the prosecutor.... Ha, ha, they are not
wasting any time, I see!... Quick, mother, have them shown in here....
I'll be back in a minute: I must just put on a collar and change my
jacket...."
</p><p>"Father!"
</p><p>Morestal stopped in the doorway:
</p><p>"What is it, my boy?" he asked.
</p><p>"I have something to say to you," said Philippe, resolutely.
</p><p>"All right. But it'll keep until presently, won't it?"
</p><p>"I have something to say to you now."
</p><p>"Oh! In that case, come along with me. Yes, you can give me a hand,
instead of Victor, who is out."
</p><p>And, laughing, he went to his room.
</p><p>Marthe involuntarily took a few steps, as though she proposed to be
present at the conversation. Philippe experienced a momentary
embarrassment. Then he quickly made up his mind:
</p><p>"No, Marthe, you had better stay."
</p><p>"But ..."
</p><p>"No, once more, no. Excuse me. I will explain later...."
</p><p>And he followed his father.

                                  * *</pre>
<p>As soon as they were alone, Morestal, who was thinking much more about
his evidence than about Philippe's words, asked, casually:
</p><p>"Is it private?"
</p><p>"Yes ... and very serious," Philippe declared.
</p><p>"Nonsense!"
</p><p>"Very serious, as you will see in a moment, father.... It's about a
position in which I find myself placed, a horrible position which I
don't know how to get out of, unless ..."
</p><p>He went no further. Acting under an instinctive impulse, thrown off his
balance by the arrival of the examining-magistrate and by a sudden
vision of the events to come, he had appealed to his father. He wanted
to speak, to say the words that would deliver him. What words? He did
not quite know. But anything, anything rather than give false evidence
and affix his signature to a lying deposition!
</p><p>He stammered at first, while his brain refused to act, seeking in vain
for an acceptable solution. How was he to stop on the downward course
along which he was being dragged by a combination of hostile forces,
accidents, coincidences and implacable, trifling facts? How was he to
break through the circle which a cruel fate was doing its utmost to
trace around him?
</p><p>It suddenly burst in upon him that the only possible way out lay in
proclaiming the immediate truth, in bluntly revealing his conduct.
</p><p>He shuddered with disgust. What! Accuse Suzanne! Was that the
half-formed idea that inspired him, unknown to himself? Had he really
thought of ruining her in order that he might be saved? It was now that
he first realized the full nature of his predicament, for he would a
thousand times rather have died than dishonour the girl, even in his
father's eyes alone.
</p><p>Morestal, who had finished dressing, chaffed him:
</p><p>"Is that all you wanted to say?"
</p><p>"Yes.... I made a mistake," replied Philippe. "I thought ..."
</p><p>He was leaning on the window-rail and looked out inertly at the large
sort of park formed by the clustering trees and the undulating meadows
of the Vosges. He was now obsessed by other thoughts, which mingled with
his own anxiety. He went back to old Morestal:
</p><p>"Are you quite sure that the arrest took place on French soil?"
</p><p>"Upon my word, you must be mad!"
</p><p>"It's possible that, without noticing it, you crossed the
frontier-line...."
</p><p>"Yes ... exactly ... so we did. But, at the moment of the first attack
and again at the moment of the arrest, we were in France. There is no
doubt about that."
</p><p>"Just think, father, if there were the slightest doubt!..."
</p><p>"Well, what then? What do you mean?"
</p><p>"I mean that this incident will have further consequences. The affair
will create a noise."
</p><p>"What do I care? The truth comes first, surely? Once we are in the
right, we are bound to see that our rights are recognized and that
Jorancé is released."
</p><p>Morestal planted himself firmly in front of his son:
</p><p>"You're of my way of thinking, I suppose?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"How do you mean, no?"
</p><p>"Listen, father: the circumstances seem to me to be very serious. The
examining-magistrate's enquiry is most important. It will serve as a
basis for later enquiries. It seems to me that we ought to reflect and
give our evidence with a certain reserve, with caution.... We must
behave prudently...."
</p><p>"We must behave like Frenchmen who are in the right," cried Morestal,
"and who, when they are in the right, fear nobody and nothing in this
world!"
</p><p>"Not even war?"
</p><p>"War! What are you talking about? War! But there can't be war over an
incident like this! The way things are shaping, Germany will yield."
</p><p>"Do you think so?" said Philippe, who seemed relieved by this assertion.
</p><p>"Certainly! But on one condition, that we establish our right firmly.
There has been a violation of the frontier. That is beyond dispute. Let
us prove it; and every chance of a conflict is removed."
</p><p>"But, if we don't succeed in proving it?" asked Philippe.
</p><p>"Ah, in that case, it can't be helped!... Of course, they will dispute
it. But have no fear, my boy: the proofs exist; and we can safely go
ahead.... Come along, they're waiting for us downstairs...."
</p><p>He grasped the door-handle.
</p><p>"Father!"
</p><p>"Look here, what's the matter with you to-day? Aren't you coming?"
</p><p>"No, not yet," said Philippe, who saw a way out and who was making a
last effort to escape. "Presently.... I must absolutely tell you.... You
and I start from a different point of view.... I have rather different
ideas from yours ... and, as the occasion happens to present itself ..."
</p><p>"Impossible, my boy! They are waiting for us...."
</p><p>"You must hear me," cried Philippe, blocking the way. "I refuse to
accept with a light heart a responsibility that is not in accordance
with my present opinions; and that is why an explanation between us has
become inevitable."
</p><p>Morestal looked at him with an air of amazement:
</p><p>"Your present opinions! Ideas different from mine! What's all this
nonsense?"
</p><p>Philippe felt, even more clearly than on the day before, the violence of
a conflict which a confession would provoke. But, this time, his resolve
was taken. There were too many reasons urging him towards a breach which
he considered necessary. With his mind and his whole frame palpitating
with his tense will, he was about to utter the irrevocable words, when
Marthe hurried into the room:
</p><p>"Don't keep your father, Philippe; the examining-magistrate is asking
for him."
</p><p>"Ah!" said Morestal. "I am not sorry that you have come to release me,
my dear Marthe. Your husband's crazy. He's been talking a string of
nonsense these past ten minutes. What you want, my boy, is rest."
</p><p>Philippe made a slight movement. Marthe whispered:
</p><p>"Be quiet."
</p><p>And she said it in so imperious a tone that he was taken aback.
</p><p>Before leaving the room, Morestal walked to the window. Bugle-notes
sounded in the distance and he leant out to hear them better.
</p><p>Marthe at once said to Philippe:
</p><p>"I came in on chance. I felt that you were seeking an explanation with
your father."
</p><p>"Yes, I had to."
</p><p>"About your ideas, I suppose?"
</p><p>"Yes, I must."
</p><p>"Your father is ill.... It's his heart.... A fit of anger might prove
fatal ... especially after last night. Not a word, Philippe."
</p><p>At that moment, Morestal closed the window. He passed in front of them
and then, turning and placing his hand on his son's shoulder, he
murmured, in accents of restrained ardour:
</p><p>"Do you hear the enemy's bugle, over there? Ah, Philippe, I don't want
it to become a war-song!... But, all the same, if it should ... if it
should!..."
</p><pre>
                                   *
                                  * *</pre>
<p>At one o'clock on the afternoon of Tuesday the 2nd of September,
Philippe, sitting opposite his father, before the pensive eyes of
Marthe, before the anxious eyes of Suzanne, Philippe, after relating
most minutely his conversation with the dying soldier, declared that he
had heard at a distance the cries of protest uttered by Jorancé, the
special commissary.
</p><p>Having made the declaration, he signed it.
