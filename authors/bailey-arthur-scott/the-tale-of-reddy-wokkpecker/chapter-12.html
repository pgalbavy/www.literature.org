<p>The next morning Jolly Robin told his wife that she would have to do all
the work of gathering the children’s breakfast. "You know, my love," he
explained, "I have important business to attend to to-day."  And before
she had time to object he left her.
</p><p>Over near the garden fence he met three plump Robins who had flown
across the meadow to help him fight Reddy Woodpecker.  And soon the four
had dropped down into the raspberry patch.
</p><p>Reddy Woodpecker had not arrived. So, while they were waiting Jolly
Robin’s friends helped themselves to berries. Under the hot sun the
fruit had ripened fast.  Finding it both sweet and juicy they ate of it
freely.  And Jolly Robin could think of no reason why he should not do
likewise.
</p><p>By the time Reddy Woodpecker came, all the Robins from over the meadow
were feeling so well fed and good-natured that they were in anything but
a fighting mood.
</p><p>"Let that Woodpecker enjoy this fruit if he likes it," they said to
Jolly in an undertone.  "There’s more than enough for everybody.  And
now," they told him, "we must go home, because we have to help our wives
feed our children."
</p><p>Off they flew.  And Jolly Robin found himself alone with Reddy
Woodpecker.
</p><p>"Ahem!" exclaimed Jolly Robin.  "It’s a fine morning, isn’t it?"
</p><p>"Delightful!" said Reddy Woodpecker.
</p><p>"It looks as if you and I were going to have this raspberry patch all to
ourselves, doesn’t it?" Jolly continued.
</p><p>Reddy Woodpecker agreed with him.
</p><p>"We ought to keep others out of it," said Jolly.
</p><p>Again Reddy Woodpecker was of the same mind as he.
</p><p>"Then this is a bargain!" cried Jolly Robin.  "I’ll ask you to guard the
place alone for a few minutes while I go home and speak to my wife."
</p><p>Reddy Woodpecker grinned as he watched Jolly Robin winging his way
homeward.
</p><p>"Humph!" he grunted.  "I may as well let that Robin have a taste of
these berries.  I certainly can’t eat them all, nor carry them all home
to my family."
</p><p>Jolly Robin found his wife anxiously awaiting his return.
</p><p>"Have you chased that Woodpecker person away?" she demanded.
</p><p>"No, my love," he replied.  "I ’ve made other arrangements.  Mr.
Woodpecker is working for me now.  So of course I don’t want to scare
him off the farm.  He’s helping me at the raspberry patch.  He’s helping
me to guard the fruit.  In fact I couldn’t have come back to speak to
you now if it wasn’t for him.  He’s watching the berries for me now."
</p><p>"Nonsense!" cried Mrs. Robin.  "If that Woodpecker person is in the
raspberry patch you may be sure he’s eating berries as fast as he can."
</p><p>"Only a few!" Jolly assured her. "There’s more than enough for our
family and his."
</p><p>"How do you know that?" she demanded. "Did you count the berries?"
</p><p>"No!" he replied.
</p><p>"Go back and count them at once!" she commanded.
</p><p>"Yes, my love!" Jolly answered.
</p><p>He really did try to count the berries. But he soon found it to be an
impossible task.  Reddy Woodpecker ate so many raspberries and carried
so many home to his children that Jolly Robin despaired of ever settling
upon the correct number.
</p><p>He felt very unhappy over the matter. And he even asked Reddy Woodpecker
what he ought to do.
</p><p>"Oh, tell your wife there are a million," Reddy Woodpecker suggested.
"If she doesn’t believe you, let her count them herself!"
</p><p>"Oh, I couldn’t do that," said Jolly Robin.
</p><p>"Well, I say there are a million," Reddy declared.  Then he picked and
ate another berry.  "Now there are nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand
nine hundred and ninety-nine," he announced. "Go home and tell your wife
I said so."
</p><p>So Jolly Robin went.  He went and told Mrs. Robin what Reddy Woodpecker
had said.
</p><p>She turned her back on him and exclaimed, "Fiddlesticks!"
