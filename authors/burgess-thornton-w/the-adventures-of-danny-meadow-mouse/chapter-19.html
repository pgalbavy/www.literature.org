<p><em>PETER RABBIT </em>sat in his secretest place in the dear
Old Briar-patch with one of his long hind legs all swelled up
and terribly sore because of the fine wire fast around it and
cutting into it. He could hear Farmer Brown’s boy going around
on the edge of the dear Old Briar-patch and stopping every little
while to do something. In spite of his pain, Peter was curious.
Finally he called Danny Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>"Danny, you are small and can keep out of sight easier than I
can. Go as near as ever you dare to Farmer Brown’s boy and find
out what he is doing," said Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>So Danny Meadow Mouse crept out as near to Farmer Brown’s boy
as ever he dared and studied and studied to make out what Farmer
Brown’s boy was doing. By and by he returned to Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>"I don’t know what he’s doing, Peter, but he’s putting something
in every one of your private little paths leading in from the
Green Meadows."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>"There are little loops of that queer stuff you’ve got hanging
to your leg, Peter," continued Danny Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>"Just so!" said Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>"And he’s put cabbage leaves and pieces of apple all around,"
said Danny.</p>

<p>"We must be careful!" said Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>Peter’s leg was in a very bad way, indeed, and Peter suffered
a great deal of pain. The worst of it was, he didn’t know how
to get off the wire that was cutting into it so. He had tried
to cut the wire with his big teeth, but he couldn’t do it. Danny
Meadow Mouse had tried and tried to gnaw the wire, but it wasn’t
of the least bit of use. But Danny wasn’t easily discouraged,
and he kept working and working at it. Once he thought he felt
it slip a little. He said nothing, but kept right on working.
Pretty soon he was sure that it slipped. He went right on working
harder than ever. By and by he had it so loose that he slipped
it right off of Peter’s leg, and Peter didn’t know anything about
it. You see, that cruel wire snare had been so tight that Peter
didn’t have any feeling except of pain left in his leg, and so
when Danny Meadow Mouse pulled the cruel wire snare off, Peter
didn’t know it until Danny held it up in front of him.</p>

<p>My, how thankful Peter was, and how he did thank Danny Meadow
Mouse! But Danny said that it was nothing at all, just nothing
at all, and that he owed more than that to Peter Rabbit for being
so good to him and letting him live in the dear Old Briar-patch.</p>

<p>It was a long time before Peter could hop as he used to, but
after the first day he managed to get around. He found that Farmer
Brown’s boy had spread those miserable wire snares in every one
of his private little paths. But Peter knew what they were now.
He showed Danny Meadow Mouse how he, because he was so small,
could safely run about among the snares and steal all the cabbage
leaves and apples which Farmer Brown’s boy had put there for bait.</p>

<p>Danny Meadow Mouse thought this great fun and a great joke on
Farmer Brown’s boy. So every day he stole the bait, and he and
Peter Rabbit lived high while Peter’s leg was getting well. And
all the time Farmer Brown’s boy wondered and wondered why he couldn’t
catch Peter Rabbit.</p>
