<p>It had certainly been expected by the public that the morning papers
would contain some interesting reading matter, and in some respects
these expectations were realized. The ignominious failure of the
Westoria land scheme was discussed with freedom and vigor, light being
cast upon it from all sides, but upon the subject which had promised
most there was a marked silence. Only in one paper there appeared a
paragraph--scarcely more--written with much clearness and with a
combined reserve and directness which could not fail to carry weight. It
was very well done, and said so much in little, and with such
unmistakable faith in its own statements and such suggestions of a
foundation for that faith, that it was something of a shock to those who
had delighted in the most elaborate ornamentation of the original story.
In effect it was a denial not only of the ornamentation, but of the
story itself, and left the liberal commentator not a fact to stand upon,
so that he became temporarily the prey of discouragement and spiritual
gloom, which was not a little added to by the events of the day.
</p>
<p>There was, however, no sense of discouragement in the mind of Senator
Blundel as he attired himself for the fray when night arrived. His mood
was a fine combination of aggressiveness, generous kindliness, hot
temper, and chivalric good feeling. He thought all day of the prospect
before him, and in the afternoon went to the length of calling at a
florist's and ordering a bouquet to be sent to Mrs. Amory, choosing it
himself and feeling some pride in the good taste of his selection. He
was so eager, indeed, that the day seemed quite long to him, and he
dressed so early after dinner that he had two or three hours to wait
before his carriage arrived.
</p><p>But it did arrive at last, and he went down to it, drawing on with some
difficulty an exceedingly tight pair of gloves, the obduracy of whose
objections to being buttoned gave him something to combat with and
suited his frame of mind to a nicety.
</p><p>He was not called upon to wait very long after his entrance into the
parlor. A few moments after his arrival Bertha came down. She was
superbly dressed in white; she carried his roses and violets, and there
burned upon her cheeks a color at once so delicate and brilliant that he
was surprised by it. He had, indeed, rather expected to see her paler.
</p><p>"Upon my soul," he said, "you don't look much frightened!"
</p><p>"I am not frightened at all," she answered.
</p><p>"That is a good thing," he returned. "We shall get on all the better for
it. I never saw you with a brighter color."
</p><p>She touched her cheek with her gloved finger.
</p><p>"It is not rouge," she said. "I have been thinking of other parties I
have attended--and of how these ladies will look at me to-night--and of
what they possibly said of me yesterday--and it has been good for me."
</p><p>"It was not so good for them, however," he suggested, regarding her with
new interest. Her spirit pleased him; he liked it that she was not ready
to allow herself to be beaten down, that she held her head erect and
confronted her enemies with resolute eyes; he had a suspicion that there
were women enough who would have been timorous and pathetic.
</p><p>"I could not hurt them," she replied. "It would matter very little what
I thought or said of them; it is only they who can harm me."
</p><p>"They shall none of them harm you," he said, stoutly. "I will see to
that; but I'm glad you are looking your best."
</p><p>But she could not help seeing that he was a trifle anxious about her.
His concern manifested itself in occasional touches of half-paternal
kindliness which were not lost upon her. He assisted her to put on her
wrap, asked her if it was warm enough, ordered her to draw it closely
about her, and tucked her under his arm as he led her out to the
carriage with an air of determined protection not to be mistaken.
</p><p>Perhaps his own views as to what form of oppression and opposition they
were to encounter were rather vague. He was sufficiently accustomed to
the opposition of men, but not to that of women; but, whatever aspect it
assumed upon this occasion, he was valiantly determined not to be moved
by it.
</p><p>"I can't dance with you," he said, "that's true--I wish I could; but I
will see that you have plenty of partners."
</p><p>"I don't think the difficulty will be in the partners," Bertha replied,
with a faint smile. "The men will not be unkind to me, you will see."
</p><p>"They won't believe it, eh?" said Blundel. Her eyes met his, and the
faint smile had a touch of bitterness.
</p><p>"Some of them will not believe it," she answered; "and some will not
care."
</p><p>There was not the slightest shade of any distrust of herself or her
surroundings, either in her face or manner, when, on reaching their
destination, she made her way into the cloak-room. The place was already
crowded--so crowded that a new-comer was scarcely noticeable. But,
though she seemed to see nothing glancing to neither right nor left, and
occupying herself with the removal of her wraps, and with a few calm
last touches bestowed upon her toilet before a mirror, scarcely a trifle
escaped her. She heard greetings, laughter, gay comments on the
brilliancy and promise of the ball; she knew where stood a woman who
would be likely to appear as an enemy, where stood another who might be
neutral, and another who it was even possible might be a friend. But she
meant to run no risks, and her long training in self-control stood her
in good stead; there was neither consciousness nor too much
unconsciousness in her face; when the woman whom she had fancied might
lean toward friendliness saw and bowed to her, she returned the greeting
with her pretty, inscrutable smile, the entire composure of which so
impressed the matron who was disposed to neutrality that she bowed also,
and so did some one near her. But there were others who did not bow, and
there were those who, discovering the familiar, graceful figure, drew
together in groups, and made an amiable comment or so. But she did not
seem to see them. When, taking up her flowers and her white
ostrich-feather fan, she passed down the little lane, they expressed
their disapproval by making way for her as she turned toward the door.
She was looking at two ladies who were entering, and, general attention
being directed toward them, they were discovered to be Mrs. Sylvestre
and Mrs. Merriam.
</p><p>"Now," it was asked, "what will <u>they</u> do?"
</p><p>What they did was very simple in itself, but very remarkable in the eyes
of the lookers-on. They paused and spoke to the delinquent in quite
their usual manner.
</p><p>"We would ask you to wait for us," Mrs. Merriam was heard to say,
finally, "but there are so many people here to be attended to, and we
saw Senator Blundel waiting for you at the door. May I tell you how
pretty your dress is, and how brilliant you are looking?"
</p><p>"Senator Blundel!" was repeated by the nearest groups. "It could not be
Senator Blundel who is with her."
</p><p>But those who were near enough to the door were subjected to the mental
shock of seeing that it was Senator Blundel himself. He appeared in
festal array, rubicund, and obstinately elate, and, stepping forward,
took his charge's hand, and drew it within his portly arm.
</p><p>"What!" he said, "you are not pale yet--and yet there were plenty of
them in there. What did they do?"
</p><p>"Three of them were good enough to bow to me," she answered, "and the
rest drew away and discussed me in undertones. The general impression
was, I think, that I was impudent. I did not feel impudent, and I don't
think I looked so."
</p><p>"Poor little woman!" he said. "Poor little woman!"
</p><p>"No! no!" she exclaimed, looking straight before her, with dangerously
bright eyes; "don't say that to me. Don't pity me, please--just yet--it
isn't good for me. I need--I need"--
</p><p>There was a second or so of dead silence. She did not tell him what she
needed.
</p><p>When they entered the ball-room a waltz was being played, and the floor
was thronged with dancers; the ladies who formed the committee of
reception stood near the door; a party of guests had just received the
usual greetings and retired. The commandress-in-chief turned to meet the
new-comers. She was a stately and severe dowager, with no intention of
flinching from her duty; but her sudden recognition of the approaching
senatorial figure was productive of a bewilderment almost too great for
her experience to cope with. She looked, caught her breath, lost it and
her composure at one and the same time, cast a despairing glance at her
aides, and fell a victim to circumstances. Here was the subject under
ban calmly making the most graceful and self-possessed obeisance before
her, and her escort was the man of whom it had been said that a few days
ago he had exposed her infamous plotting. This was more than even the
most experienced matron could be prepared for. It must be admitted that
her presence of mind deserted her, and that her greetings were not
marked by the ready tact which usually characterized them.
</p><p>"My first ball, madam," remarked the senator, scenting difficulty in the
breeze, and confronting it boldly. "But for my friend, Mrs. Amory, I am
afraid I should not be here. I begin to feel indebted to her already."
</p><p>"It promises very well," said Bertha. "I never saw the room gayer. How
pretty the decorations are!"
</p><p>They passed on to make room for others, leaving the estimable ladies
behind them pale with excitement, and more demoralized than they would
have been willing to admit.
</p><p>"What does it mean?" they asked one another. "They appear to be the best
of friends! What are we to understand?"
</p><p>There was one kindly matron at the end of the line who looked after the
pair with an expression of sympathy which was rather at variance with
the severity of the rôle she had been called upon to enact.
</p><p>"It appears," she said, "as if the whole story might be a fabrication,
and the senator determined to prove it so. I hope with all my heart he
will."
</p><p>By the time they reached their seats the news of their arrival had made
the circle of the room. Bertha herself, while she had listened with a
smile to her escort's remarks, had seen amazement and recognition flash
out upon a score of faces; but she had preserved her smile intact, and
still wore it when she took her chair. She spoke to Blundel, waving her
fan with a soft, even motion.
</p><p>"We have run the gauntlet," she said, "and we have chosen a good
position. Almost everybody in the room has seen us; almost every one in
the room is looking at us."
</p><p>"Let them look!" he answered. "I have no objection to it."
</p><p>"Ah, they will look!" she returned. "And we came to be--to be looked at.
And it is very good of you to have no objections. Do I seem perfectly
at ease? I hope so--though I am entirely well aware that at least a
hundred people are discussing me. Is the expression of my eyes
good--careless enough?"
</p><p>"Yes, child, yes," he answered, a little uneasily. There was an
undertone in her voice which troubled him, much as he admired her spirit
and self-control.
</p><p>"Thank you," she said. "Here is a bold man coming to ask me to dance. I
told you the men would not be afraid of me. I think, if you approve of
it, I will dance with him."
</p><p>"Go and dance," he answered.
</p><p>When her partner bore her away he took charge of her flowers and wrap in
the most valiant manner, and carried them with him when he went to pay
his respects to the matrons of his acquaintance who sat against the wall
discussing with each other the most exciting topic of the hour, and who,
when he addressed them, questioned him as closely as good-breeding would
permit, upon all subjects likely to cast light upon this topic.
</p><p>"Never was at a ball in my life before," he admitted. "Asked Mrs. Amory
to bring me. Wanted to see how I should like it."
</p><p>"With Mrs. Amory?" remarked matron No. 1. "She is dancing, I believe."
</p><p>"Yes," he said, good-naturedly. "She will be dancing all night, I
suppose, and I shall be carrying her flowers; but I don't mind it--in
fact, I rather like it. I dare say there are two or three young fellows
who would be glad enough to be in my place."
</p><p>"I have no doubt," was the reply. "She has been very popular--and very
gay."
</p><p>"She is very popular with me," said the senator, "though I am an old
fogy, and don't count. We are great friends, and I am very proud to be
her escort to-night. I feel I am making my <u>début</u> under favorable
circumstances."
</p><p>There could be no doubt of his sentiments after that. He was her
friend. He admired her. He even made a point of saying so. What became
of the story of the scandal? It seemed to have ended in nothing and
worse than nothing; there was something a little ridiculous about such a
tame termination to such an excitement. One or two of the ladies who had
found it most absorbing looked aimlessly into space, and an embarrassed
silence fell upon them.
</p><p>Bertha ended her dance and returned to her seat. Her color was even
brighter than before, and her smile was more brilliant. For a few
moments a little group surrounded her, and her programme was half full.
Blundel came back to his post like a sentinel. If she had been looked at
before, she was regarded now with a double eagerness. Those who were not
dancing watched her every movement; even those who danced asked each
other questions. The group about her chair was added to and became
gayer, but there were no women numbered in the circle. The general
wonder was as to what would be done in the end. So far, round dances
only had been danced. The next dance was a quadrille. The music struck
up, and the dancers began to take their places. As they did so a party
entered the room and made its way toward the end where the group stood
about the chair. Bertha did not see it; she was just rising to take her
station in the set nearest to her. The matron of the party, who was a
figure so familiar in social circles as to be recognized at once by all
who saw her, was accompanied by her daughter and an escort. It was the
wife of the Secretary of State, and her cavalier was Colonel Tredennis.
</p><p>"There is Mrs. Amory," she said to him as they approached. "She is
taking her place in the quadrille. One moment, if you please."
</p><p>Experience had taught her all that might be feared, and a quick eye
showed her that something was wrong. Bertha advanced to her place,
laughing a little at some jest of her partner's. She had not seen who
the dancers were. The jest and the laugh ended, and she looked up at
her <u>vis-à-vis</u>. The lady at his side was not smiling; she was gazing
steadily at Bertha herself. It seemed as if she had been waiting to
catch her eye. It was the "great lady," and, having carried the
figurative pebble until this fitting moment, she threw it. She spoke two
or three words to her partner, took his arm, turned her back, and walked
away.
</p><p>Bertha turned rather pale. She felt the blood ebb out of her face. There
was no mistaking the significance of the action, and it had not escaped
an eye. This was more than she had thought of. She made a movement, with
what intention she herself was too much shaken to know, and, in making
it, her eyes fell upon a face whose expression brought to her an actual
shock of relief. It was the face of the kind and generous gentlewoman
who had just entered, and who, at this moment, spoke to her daughter.
</p><p>"My dear," she said, "I think you promised Colonel Tredennis the first
quadrille. Go and take that vacant place, and when you speak to Mrs.
Amory ask her to come and talk to me a little as soon as the dance is
over."
</p><p>There was a tone of gentle decision in her voice and a light in her eye
which were not lost upon the bystanders. She gave Bertha a bow and
smile, and sat down. The most fastidious woman in Washington--the woman
who drew her lines so delicately that she had even been called almost
too rigorous; the woman whose well-known good taste and good feeling had
given her a power mere social position was powerless to bestow--had
taken the subject of the hour's scandal under her protection, and
plainly believed nothing to her discredit.
</p><p>In five minutes the whole room was aware of it. She had greeted Mrs.
Amory cordially, she had openly checkmated an antagonist, she had sent
her own daughter to fill the place left vacant in the dance.
</p><p>"She would not have done that if she had not had the best of reasons,"
it was said.
</p><p>"And Senator Blundel would scarcely be here if the story had been true."
</p><p>"He has told several of his friends that he is here to prove that it is
<u>not</u> true!"
</p><p>"He denied it again and again yesterday."
</p><p>"It was denied in one of the morning papers, and they say he kept it out
of the rest because he was determined she should not be more publicly
discussed."
</p><p>"She is not one of the women who have been in the habit of giving rise
to discussion."
</p><p>"She is a pretty, feminine-looking little creature."
</p><p>"Poor girl! It must have been bitter enough for her."
</p><p>"Rather fine of old Blundel to stand by her in this way."
</p><p>"He would not do it if there was not something rather fine in her. He is
not a ladies' man, old Sam Blundel. Look at him! How he looms up behind
his bouquet!"
</p><p>The tide of public opinion had taken a turn. Before the dance had ended
two or three practical matrons, who were intimately known to Colonel
Tredennis' friendly supporter, had made their way to her and asked her
opinion and intentions frankly, and had received information calculated
to set every doubt at rest.
</p><p>"It is scarcely necessary for me to speak of my opinion of the matter,"
the lady said, "when we have the evidence of Senator Blundel's presence
here with Mrs. Amory to-night. I should feel myself unpardonably in the
wrong if I did not take the most open measures in the defence of the
daughter of my old friend, who has been treated most unjustly. And I
cannot help hoping that she will have other defenders than myself."
</p><p>Several of the matrons so addressed were seated within speaking range
when Bertha came to her friend at the close of the dance, and she
recognized at once on approaching them that she need fear them no
longer. But she could not say much in response to their greetings; she
answered them briefly, bowed slightly, and sat down in the chair near
the woman who had protected her. She could even say but little to her;
the color had died out of her face at last; the strain she had borne so
long had reached its highest tension to-night, and the shock of the
moment, received through an envious woman's trivial spite, slight as it
might have been in itself, represented too much to her. As he had passed
her in the dance and touched her hand, Tredennis had felt it as cold as
ice, and the look of her quiet, white face had been almost more than he
could bear to see.
</p><p>"Bertha," he had said to her once, "for God's sake, take courage!"
</p><p>But she had not answered him. A few months ago she would have given him
a light, flippant reply, if her very soul had been wrung within her, but
now she was past that.
</p><p>As she sat, afterwards, by the wife of the Secretary of State, her hand
shook as she held her fan.
</p><p>"You were very kind to me just now," she said, in a low voice. "I cannot
express my thanks as I wish."
</p><p>"My dear," was the reply, "do not speak of it. I came to take care of
you. I think you will have no more trouble. But I am afraid this has
been too much for you. You are shivering a little."
</p><p>"I am cold," Bertha answered. "I--feel as if--something strange had
happened to me. It was not so before. I seem--to have lost courage."
</p><p>"But you must not lose courage yet," she said, with a manner at once
soft and firm. "A great many people are looking at you. They will be
very curious to know how you feel. It is best that you should not let
them see."
</p><p>She spoke rather rapidly, but in a low voice. No one near could hear.
She was smiling, as if the subject of the conversation was the least
important in the world.
</p><p>"Listen to me," she said, in the same manner, "and try to look as if we
were speaking of ordinary topics. I dare say you feel as if you would
prefer to go away, but I think you must remain. Everybody here must
understand that you have friends who entirely disbelieve all that has
been said against you, and also that they wish to make their confidence
in you public. I should advise you to appear to enjoy yourself
moderately well. I think I wish you to dance several times again. I
think there will be no difficulty in arranging the next square dance.
When the presidential party arrives, the President will, I have no
doubt, be pleased to talk to you a little. It would be republican to say
that it is absurd to consider that such a thing can be of consequence;
but there are people with whom it will have weight. As soon as possible,
I shall send you down to the supper-room with Senator Blundel. A glass
of wine will do you good. Here is Senator Blundel now. Do you think you
can talk to him in your usual manner?"
</p><p>"I will try," said Bertha. "And, if I do not, I think he will
understand."
</p><p>He did understand. The little incident had been no more lost upon him
than upon others. He was glowing with repressed wrath, and sympathy, and
the desire to do something which should express his feeling. He saw at
once the change which had come upon her, and realized to the full all
that it denoted. When he bore her off to the supper-room he fairly
bristled with defiance of the lookers-on who made way for them.
</p><p>"Confound the woman!" he said. "If it had only been a man!"
</p><p>He found her the most desirable corner in the supper-room, and devoted
himself to her service with an assiduity which touched her to the heart.
</p><p>"You have lost your color," he said. "That won't do. We must bring it
back."
</p><p>"I am afraid it will not come back," she answered.
</p><p>And it did not, even though the tide had turned, and that it had done so
became more manifest every moment. They were joined shortly by Colonel
Tredennis and his party, and by Mrs. Merriam and hers. It was plain that
Mrs. Amory was to be alone no more; people who had been unconscious of
her existence in the ball-room suddenly recognized it as she sat
surrounded by her friends; the revulsion of feeling which had taken
place in her favor expressed itself in a hundred trifles. But her color
was gone, and returned no more, though she bore herself with outward
calmness. It was Colonel Tredennis who was her first partner when they
returned to the ball-room. He had taken a seat near her at the
supper-table, and spoken a few words to her.
</p><p>"Will you give me a place on your card, Bertha?" he had said, and she
had handed it to him in silence.
</p><p>He was not fond of dancing, and they had rarely danced together, but he
wished to be near her until she had had time to recover herself. Better
he than another man who might not understand so well; he knew how to be
silent, at least.
</p><p>So they went through their dance together, exchanging but few words, and
interested spectators looked on, and one or two remarked to each other
that, upon the whole, it appeared that Mrs. Amory was rather well
supported, and that there had evidently been a mistake somewhere.
</p><p>And then the colonel took her back to her seat, and there were new
partners; and between the dances one matron after another found the way
to her, and, influenced by the general revulsion of feeling, exhibited a
cordiality and interest in marked contrast with the general bearing at
the outset of the evening. Perhaps there were those who were rather glad
to be relieved of the responsibility laid upon them. When the
presidential party arrived it was observed that the President himself
was very cordial when he joined the group at the end of the room, the
centre figure of which was the wife of his friend and favorite cabinet
officer. It was evident that he, at least, had not been affected by the
gossip of the hour. His greeting of Mrs. Amory was marked in its
kindness, and before he went away it was whispered about that he also
had felt an interest in the matter when it had reached his ears, and was
not sorry to have an opportunity of indirectly expressing his opinion.
</p><p>The great lady took her departure in bitterness of spirit; the dances
went on, Bertha went through one after another, and between her waltzes
held her small court, and was glanced at askance no more. Any slight
opposition which might have remained would have been overpowered by the
mere force of changed circumstances. Before the evening was at an end it
had become plain that the attempt to repress and overwhelm little Mrs.
Amory had been a complete failure, and had left her better defended than
it had found her.
</p><p>"But she has lost something," Senator Blundel said to himself, as he
watched her dancing. "Confound it!--_I_ can see it--she is not what she
was three months ago; she is not what she was when she came into the
room."
</p><p>Tredennis also recognized the change which had come upon her, and before
long knew also that she had seen his recognition of it, and that she
made no effort to conceal it from him. He felt that he could almost have
better borne to see her old, careless gayety, which he had been wont to
resent in secret bitterness of heart.
</p><p>Once, when they chanced to stand alone together for a moment, she spoke
to him quickly.
</p><p>"Is it late?" she asked. "We seem to have been here so long! I have
danced so much. Will it not soon be time to go home?"
</p><p>"Do you want to go home?" he asked.
</p><p>"Yes," she answered, almost breathlessly; "the music seems so loud it
bewilders me a little. How gay it is! How the people dance! The sound
and motion make me blind and dizzy. Philip!"
</p><p>The tone in which she uttered his name was so low and tense that he was
startled by it.
</p><p>"What is it?" he asked.
</p><p>"If there are many more dances, I am afraid--I cannot go through them--I
think--I am breaking down, and I must not--I must not! Tell me what to
do!"
</p><p>He made a movement so that he stood directly before her and shielded her
from the observation of those near them. He realized the danger of the
moment.
</p><p>"Look up at me!" he said. "Try to fix your eyes on me steadily. This
feeling will pass away directly. You will go soon and you must not break
down. Do not let yourself be afraid that you will."
</p><p>She obeyed him like a child, trying to look at him steadily.
</p><p>"Tell me one more dance will be enough," she said, "and say you will
dance it with me if you can."
</p><p>"I will," he answered, "and you need not speak a word."
</p>
<p>When the senator found himself alone in the carriage with her his sense
of the triumph achieved found its expression in words.
</p><p>"Well," he said, "I think we have put an end to <u>that</u> story."
</p><p>"Yes," Bertha answered, "they will not say anything more about me. You
have saved me from that."
</p><p>She leaned forward and looked out of the window. Carriages blocked the
street, and were driving up and driving away; policemen were opening and
shutting doors and calling names loudly; a few street-Arabs stood on the
pavement and looked with envious eyes at the bright dresses and
luxurious wraps of the party passing under the awning; the glare of
gas-light fell upon a pretty face upturned to its companions, and a
girl's laugh rang out on the night air. Bertha turned away. She looked
at Senator Blundel. Her own face had no color.
</p><p>"I think," she said,--"I think I have been to my last ball."
</p><p>"No--no," he answered. "That's nonsense. You will dance at many a one."
</p><p>"I think," she said,--"I think this is the last."
</p><p>Senator Blundel did not accompany her into the house when they reached
it. He left her at the door, almost wringing her small cold hand in his
stout warm one.
</p><p>"Come!" he said. "You are tired now, and no wonder, but to-morrow you
will be better. You want sleep and you must have it. Go in, child, and
go to bed. Good-night. God bless you! You will--be better to-morrow."
</p><p>She went through the hall slowly, intending to go to her room, but when
she reached the parlor she saw that it was lighted. She had given orders
that the servants should not sit up for her, and the house was silent
with the stillness of sleep. She turned at the parlor door and looked
in. A fire still burned in the grate, her own chair was drawn up before
it, and in the chair sat a figure, the sight of which caused her to
start forward with an exclamation,--a tall, slender, old figure, his
gray head bowed upon his hand.
</p><p>"Papa!" she cried. "Can it be you, papa? What has happened?"
</p><p>He rose rather slowly, and looked at her; it was evident that he had
been plunged in deep thought; his eyes were heavy, and he looked aged
and worn. He put out his hand, took hers, and drew her to him.
</p><p>"My dear," he said. "My dear child!"
</p><p>She stood quite still for a moment, looking up at him.
</p><p>"You have come to tell me something," she said, at length, in a low,
almost monotonous voice. "And it is something about Richard. It is
something--something wretched."
</p><p>A slight flush mounted to his cheek,--a flush of shame.
</p><p>"Yes," he answered, "it is something wretched."
</p><p>She began to shake like a leaf, but it was not from fear.
</p><p>"Then do not be afraid," she said; "there is no need! Richard--has not
spared me!"
</p><p>It was the first time through all she had borne and hidden, through all
the years holding, for her, suffering and bitterness and disenchantment
which had blighted all her youth,--it was the first time she had
permitted her husband's name to escape her lips when she could not
compel herself to utter it gently, and that, at last, he himself had
forced such speech from her was the bitterest indignity of all.
</p><p>And if she felt this, the professor felt it keenly, too. He had marked
her silence and self-control at many a time when he had felt that the
fire that burned in her must make her speak; but she had never spoken,
and the dignity of her reserve had touched him often.
</p><p>"What is it that Richard has done now, papa?" she said.
</p><p>He put a tremulous hand into his pocket, and drew forth a letter.
</p><p>"Richard," he said,--"Richard has gone abroad."
</p><p>She had felt that she was to receive some blow, but she had scarcely
been prepared for this. She repeated his words in bewilderment.
</p><p>"Richard has gone abroad!"
</p><p>The professor put his hand on her shoulder.
</p><p>"Sit down, my dear," he said. "You must sit down."
</p><p>There was a chair near her; it stood by the table on which the professor
had been wont to take his cup of tea; she turned and sat down in this
chair, and resting her elbows on the table, dropped her forehead upon
her hands. The professor drew near to her side; his gentle, refined old
face flushed and paled alternately; his hands were tremulous; he spoke
in a low, agitated voice.
</p><p>"My dear," he said, "I find it very hard to tell you all--all I have
discovered. It is very bitter to stand here upon your husband's hearth,
and tell you--my child and his wife--that the shadow of dishonor and
disgrace rests upon him. He has not been truthful; we have--been
deceived."
</p><p>She did not utter a word.
</p><p>"For some time I have been anxious," he went on; "but I blame myself
that I was not anxious sooner. I am not a business man; I have not been
practical in my methods of dealing with him; the fault was in a great
measure mine. His nature was not a strong one,--it was almost impossible
for him to resist temptation; I knew that, and should have remembered
it. I have been very blind. I did not realize what was going on before
my eyes. I thought his interest in the Westoria scheme was only one of
his many whims. I was greatly to blame."
</p><p>"No," said Bertha; "it was not you who were to blame. I was more blind
than you--I knew him better than--than any one else."
</p><p>"A short time ago," said the professor, "I received a letter from an old
friend who knows a great deal of my business affairs. He is a business
man, and I have been glad to entrust him with the management of various
investments. In this manner he knew something of the investment of the
money which was yours. He knew more of Richard's methods than Richard
was aware of. He had heard rumors of the Westoria land scheme, and had
accidentally, in the transaction of his business, made some discoveries.
He asked me if I knew the extent to which your fortune had been
speculated with. Knowing a few facts, he was able to guess at others"--
</p><p>Bertha lifted her face from her hands.
</p><p>"My money!" she exclaimed. "My fortune!"
</p><p>"He had speculated with it at various times, sometimes gaining,
sometimes losing; the Westoria affair seems to have dazzled him--and he
invested largely"--
</p><p>Bertha rose from her chair.
</p><p>"It was Philip Tredennis' money he invested," she said. "Philip
Tredennis"--
</p><p>"It was not Philip's money," the professor answered; "that I have
discovered. But it was Philip's generosity which would have made it
appear so. In this letter--written just before he sailed--Richard has
admitted the truth to me--finding what proof I had against him."
</p><p>Bertha lifted her hands and let them fall at her sides.
</p><p>"Papa," she said, "I do not understand this--I do not understand. Philip
Tredennis! He gave money to Richard! Richard accepted money from him--to
shield himself, to--This is too much for me!"
</p><p>"Philip had intended the money for Janey," said the professor, "and when
he understood how Richard had involved himself, and how his difficulties
would affect you and your future, he made a most remarkable offer: he
offered to assume the responsibility of Richard's losses. He did not
intend that you should know what he had done. Such a thing would only
have been possible for Philip Tredennis, and it was because I knew him
so well, that, when I heard that it was his money that had been risked
in the Westoria lands, I felt that something was wrong. He was very
reticent, and that added to my suspicions. Then I made the discoveries
through my friend, and my accusations of Richard forced him to admit the
truth."
</p><p>"The truth!" said Bertha,--"that _I_ was to live upon Philip Tredennis'
money; that, having been ruined by my husband, I was to be supported by
Philip Tredennis' bounty!"
</p><p>"Richard was in despair," said the professor, "and in his extremity he
forgot"--
</p><p>"He forgot <u>me</u>!" said Bertha. "Yes, he forgot--a great many things."
</p><p>"It has seemed always to be Philip who has remembered," said the
professor, sadly. "Philip has been generous and thoughtful for us from
first to last."
</p><p>Bertha's hand closed itself.
</p><p>"Yes," she cried; "always Philip--always Philip!"
</p><p>"What could have been finer and more delicate than his care and planning
for you in this trouble of the last few days, to which I have been so
blind!" said the professor.
</p><p>"<u>His</u> care and planning!" echoed Bertha, turning slowly toward him.
"His! Did you not hear that Senator Blundel"--
</p><p>"It was he who went to Senator Blundel," the professor answered. "It was
he who spoke to the wife of the Secretary of State. I learned it from
Mrs. Merriam. Out of all the pain we have borne, or may have to bear,
the memory of Philip's faithful affection for us"--
</p><p>He did not finish his sentence. Bertha stopped him. Her clenched hand
had risen to her side, and was pressed against it.
</p><p>"It was Philip who came to me in my trouble in Virginia," she said. "It
was Philip who saw my danger and warned me of it when I would not hear
him; but I could not know that I owed him such a debt as this!"
</p><p>"We should never have known it from him," the professor replied. "He
would have kept silent to the end."
</p><p>Bertha looked at the clock upon the mantel.
</p><p>"It is too late to send for him now," she said; "it is too late, and a
whole night must pass before"--
</p><p>"Before you say to him--what?" asked the professor.
</p><p>"Before I tell him that Richard made a mistake," she answered, with
white and trembling lips; "that he must take his money back--that I will
not have it."
</p><p>She caught her father's arm and clung to it, looking into his troubled
face.
</p><p>"Papa," she said, "will you take me home again? I think you must, if
you will. There seems to be no place for me. If you will let me stay
with you until I have time to think."
</p><p>The professor laid his hand upon hers and held it closely.
</p><p>"My dear," he said, "my home is yours. It has never seemed so much mine
since you left it; but this may not be so bad as you think. I do not
know how much we may rely upon Richard's hopes,--they are not always to
be relied upon,--but it appears that he has hopes of retrieving some of
his losses through a certain speculation he seems to have regarded as a
failure, but which suddenly promises to prove a success."
</p><p>"I have never thought of being poor," said Bertha; "I do not think I
should know how to be poor. But, somehow, it is not the money I am
thinking of; that will come later, I suppose. I scarcely seem to realize
yet"--
</p><p>Her voice and her hand shook, and she clung to him more closely.
</p><p>"Everything has gone wrong," she said, wildly; "everything must be
altered. No one is left to care for me but you. No one must do it but
you. Now that Richard has gone, it is not Philip who must be kind to
me--not Philip--Philip last of all!"
</p><p>"Not Philip?" he echoed. "<u>Not</u> Philip?"
</p><p>And, as he said it, they both heard feet ascending the steps at the
front door.
</p><p>"My child," said the professor, "that is Philip now. He spoke of calling
in on me on his way home. Perhaps he has been anxious at finding me out
so late. I do not understand you--but must I go and send him away?"
</p><p>"No," she answered, shuddering a little, as if with cold, "it is for me
to send him away. But I must tell him first about the money. I am glad
he has come. I am glad another night will not pass without his knowing.
I think I want to speak to him alone--if you will send him here, and
wait for a little while in the library."
</p><p>She did not see her father's face as he went away from her; he did not
see hers; she turned and stood upon the hearth with her back toward the
door.
</p><p>She stood so when, a few minutes afterward, Philip Tredennis came in;
she stood so until he was within a few feet of her. Then she moved a
little and looked up.
</p><p>What she saw in him arrested for the moment her power to speak, and for
that moment both were silent. Often as she had recognized the change
which had taken place in him, often as the realization of it had wrung
her heart, and wrung it all the more that she had understood so little,
she had never before seen it as she saw it then. All the weariness, the
anxious pain, the hopeless sadness of his past, seemed to have come to
the surface; he could endure no more; he had borne the strain too long,
and he knew too well that the end had come. No need for words to tell
him that he must lose even the poor and bitter comfort he had clung to;
he had made up his mind to that when he had defended her against the man
who himself should have been her defence.
</p><p>So he stood silent and his deep eyes looked out from his strong, worn,
haggard face, holding no reproach, full only of pity for her.
</p><p>There was enough to pity in her. If she saw anguish in his eyes, what he
saw in hers as she uplifted them he could scarcely have expressed in any
words he knew; surely there were no words into which he could have put
the pang their look gave him, telling him as it did that she had reached
the point where she could stand on guard no more.
</p><p>"Richard," she said at length, "has gone away."
</p><p>"That I knew," he answered.
</p><p>"When?" she asked.
</p><p>"I had a letter from him this morning," he said.
</p><p>"You did not wish to tell me?" she returned.
</p><p>"I thought," he began, "that perhaps"--and stopped.
</p><p>"You thought that he would write to me too," she said. "He--did not."
</p><p>He did not speak, and she went on.
</p><p>"When I returned to-night," she said, "papa was waiting for me. He had
received a letter, too, and it told him--something he suspected
before--something I had not suspected--something I could not know"--
</p><p>Her voice broke, and when she began again there was a ring of desperate
appeal to it.
</p><p>"When I was a girl," she said, "when you knew me long ago, what was
there of good in me that you should have remembered it through all that
you have known of me since then?--there must have been
something--something good or touching--something more than the goodness
in yourself--that made you pitiful of me, and generous to me, and
anxious for my sake. Tell me what it was."
</p><p>"It was," he said, and his own voice was low and broken too, and his
deep and sad eyes wore a look she had never seen before,--the look that,
in the eyes of a woman, would have spoken of welling tears,--"it
was--yourself."
</p><p>"Myself!" she cried. "Oh, if it was myself, and there were goodness and
truth, and what was worth remembering in me, why did it not save me from
what I have been--and from what I am to-day? I do not think I meant to
live my life so badly then; I was only careless and happy in a girlish
way. I had so much faith and hope, and believed so much in all good
things; and yet my life has all been wrong, and I seem to believe no
more, and everything is lost to me; and since the days when I looked
forward there is a gulf that I can never, never pass again."
</p><p>She came nearer to him, and a sob broke from her.
</p><p>"What am I to say to you," she said, "now that I know all that you have
done for me while I--while I--Why should you have cared to protect me?
I was not kind to you--I was not careful of your feelings"--
</p><p>"No," he answered. "You--were not."
</p><p>"I used to think that you despised me," she went on, "once I told you
so. I even tried to give you the reason. I showed my worst self to you;
I was unjust and bitter; I hurt you many a time."
</p><p>He seemed to labor for his words, and yet he labored rather to control
and check than to utter them.
</p><p>"I am going away," he said. "When I made the arrangement with Richard,
of which you know, I meant to go away. I gathered, from what your father
said, that you mean to render useless my poor effort to be of use to
you."
</p><p>"I cannot "--she began, but she could go no farther.
</p><p>"When I leave you--as I must," he said, "let me at least carry away with
me the memory that you were generous to me at the last."
</p><p>"At the last," she repeated after him, "the last!"
</p><p>She uttered a strange, little inarticulate cry. He saw her lift up one
of her arms, look blindly at the bracelet on her wrist, drop it at her
side, and then stand looking up at him.
</p><p>There was a moment of dead silence.
</p><p>"Janey shall take the money," she said; "I cannot."
</p><p>What the change was that he saw come over her white face and swaying
figure he only felt, as he might have felt a blow in the dark from an
unknown hand. What the great shock was that came upon him he only felt
in the same way.
</p><p>She sank upon the sofa, clinging to the cushion with one shaking hand.
Suddenly she broke into helpless sobbing, like a child's, tears
streaming down her cheeks as she lifted her face in appeal.
</p><p>"You have been good to me," she said. "You have been kind. Be good to
me--be kind to me--once more. You must go away--and I cannot take from
you what you want to give me; but I am not so bad as I have seemed--or
so hard! What you have wished me to be I will try to be! I will live for
my children. I will be--as good--as I can. I will do anything you tell
me to do--before you leave me! I will live all my life afterward--as
Bertha Herrick might have lived it! Only do not ask me to take the
money!"
</p><p>For a few seconds all the room was still. When he answered her she could
barely hear his voice.
</p><p>"I will ask of you nothing," he said.
</p><p>He lifted her hand and bowed his head over it. Then he laid it back upon
the cushion. It lay there as if it had been carved from stone.
</p><p>"Good-by," he said. "Good-by."
</p><p>He saw her lips part, but no sound came from them.
</p><p>So he went away. He scarcely felt the floor beneath his feet. He saw
nothing of the room about him. It seemed as if there was an endless
journey between himself and the door through which he was to pass. The
extremity of his mortal agony was like drunkenness.
</p><p>When he was gone, she fell with a shudder, and lay still with her cheek
against the crimson cushion.
</p>
<p>The professor was sitting at her bedside when she opened her eyes again.
Her first recognition was of his figure, sitting, the head bowed upon
the hand, as she had seen it when she came first into the house.
</p><p>"Papa," she said, "you are with me?"
</p><p>"Yes, my dear," he answered.
</p><p>"And--there is no one else?"
</p><p>"No, my dear."
</p><p>She put out her hand and laid it upon his arm. He thought, with a bitter
pang, that she did it as she had often done it in her girlhood, and
that, in spite of the change in her, she wore a look which seemed to
belong to those days too.
</p><p>"You will stay with me," she said. "I have come back to you."
