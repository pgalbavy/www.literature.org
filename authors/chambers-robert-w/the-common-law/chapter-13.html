<p>He never doubted that, when at length the time came for the great
change&mdash;though perhaps not until the last moment &mdash;Valerie
would consent to marry him. Because, so far in his life of twenty-eight
years, everything he had desired very much had come true&mdash;everything
he had really believed in and worked for, had happened as he foresaw
it would, in spite of the doubts, the fears, the apprehensions
that all creators of circumstances and makers of their own destiny
experience.</p>

<p>Among his fellow-men he had forged a self-centred, confident
way to the front; and had met there not ultimate achievement,
but a young girl, Valerie West. Through her, somehow, already
was coming into his life and into his work that indefinite, elusive
quality&mdash;that <em>something</em>, the existence of which, until
the last winter, he had never even admitted. But it was coming;
he first became conscious of it through his need of it; suspected
its existence as astronomers suspect the presence of a star yet
uncharted and unseen. Suddenly it had appeared in his portrait
of Valerie; and he knew that Querida had recognised it.</p>

<p>In his picture "A Bride," the pale, mysterious glow of it suffused
his canvas. It was penetrating into his own veins, too, subtle,
indefinable, yet always there now; and he was sensitive to its
presence not only when absorbed in his work but, more or less
in his daily life.</p>

<p>And it was playing tricks on him, too, as when one morning, absorbed
by the eagerness of achievement, and midway in the happiness of
his own work, suddenly and unbidden the memory of poor Annan came
to him&mdash;the boy's patient, humorous face bravely confronting failure
on the canvas, before him, from which Neville had turned away
without a word, because he had no good word to say of it.</p>

<p>And Neville, scarcely appreciating the reason for any immediate
self-sacrifice, nevertheless had laid aside his brushes as at
some unheard command, and had gone straight to Annan's studio.
And there he had spent the whole morning giving the discouraged
boy all that was best in him of strength and wisdom and cheerful
sympathy, until, by noon, an almost hopeless canvas was saved;
and Annan, going with him to the door, said unsteadily, "Kelly,
that is the kindest thing one man ever did for another, and I'll
never forget it."</p>

<p>Yes, the <em>something</em> seemed to have penetrated to his
own veins now; he felt its serene glow mounting when he spent
solemn evenings in John Burleson's room, the big sculptor lying
in his morris-chair, sometimes irritable, sometimes morose, but
always now wearing the vivid patch of colour on his flat and sunken
cheeks.</p>

<p>Once John said: "Why on earth do you waste a perfectly good afternoon
dawdling in this place with me?"</p>

<p>And Neville, for a second, wondered, too; then he laughed:</p>

<p>"I get all that I give you, John, and more, too. Shut up and
mind your business."</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> do you get from me?" demanded the literal one,
astonished.</p>

<p>"All that you are, Johnny; which is much that I am not&mdash;but ought
to be&mdash;may yet be."</p>

<p>"That's some sort of transcendental philosophy, isn't it?" grumbled
the sculptor.</p>

<p>"You ought to know better than I, John. The sacred codfish never
penetrated to the Hudson. <em>Inde irac!</em>"</p>

<p>Yes, truly, whatever it was that had crept into his veins had
imperceptibly suffused him, enveloped him&mdash;and was working changes.
He had a vague idea, sometimes, that Valerie had been the inception,
the source, the reagent in the chemistry which was surely altering
either himself or the world of men around him; that the change
was less a synthesis than a catalysis&mdash;that he was gradually becoming
different because of her nearness to him&mdash;her physical and spiritual
nearness.</p>

<p>He had plenty of leisure to think of her while she was away;
but thought of her was now only an active ebullition of the ceaseless
consciousness of her which so entirely possessed him. When a selfish
man loves&mdash;if he <em>really</em> loves&mdash;his disintegration begins.</p>

<p>Waking, sleeping, in happiness, in perplexity, abroad, at home,
active or at rest, inspired or weary, alone or with others, an
exquisite sense of her presence on earth invaded him, subtly refreshing
him with every breath he drew. He walked abroad amid the city
crowds companioned by her always; at rest the essence of her stole
through and through him till the very air around seemed sweetened.</p>

<p>He heard others mention her, and remained silent, aloof, wrapped
in his memories, like one who listens to phantoms in a dream praising
perfection.</p>

<p>Lying back in his chair before his canvas, he thought of her
often&mdash;of odd little details concerning their daily life&mdash;details
almost trivial&mdash;gestures, a glance, a laugh&mdash;recollections which
surprised him with the very charm of their insignificance.</p>

<p>He remembered that he had never known her to be ungenerous&mdash;had
never detected in her a wilfully selfish motive. In his life he
had never before believed in a character so utterly unshackled
by thought of self.</p>

<p>He remembered that he had never known her to fail in sympathy
for any living thing; had never detected in her an indifference
to either the happiness or the sorrow of others. In his life he
had never before believed that the command to love one's neighbour
had in it anything more significant than the beauty of an immortal
theory. He believed it now because, in her, he had seen it in
effortless practice. He was even beginning to understand how it
might be possible for him to follow where she led&mdash;as she, unconsciously,
was a follower of a precept given to lead the world through eternities.</p>

<p>Leaning on the closed piano, thinking of her in the still, sunny
afternoons, faintly in his ears her voice seemed to sound; and
he remembered her choice of ballads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
&mdash;"For even the blind distinguisheth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king with his robe and crown;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But only the humble eye of faith<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beholdeth Jesus of Nazareth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beggar's tattered gown.

</p>
<p>
"I saw Him not in the mendicant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I heeded not his cry;<br/>
Now Christ in His infinite mercy grant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That the prayer I say in my day of want,<br/>
Be not in scorn put by."

</p>
</div>
<p>No; he had never known her to be unkind, uncharitable, unforgiving;
he had never known her to be insincere, untruthful, or envious.
But the decalogue is no stronger than its weakest link. Was it
in the heart of such a woman&mdash;this woman he loved&mdash;was it in the
heart of this young girl to shatter it?</p>

<p>He went on to Ashuelyn, confident of her and of himself, less
confident of his sister&mdash;almost appalled at the prospect of reconciling
his father and mother to this marriage that must surely be. Yet&mdash;so
far in life&mdash;life had finally yielded to him what he fought for;
and it must yield now; and in the end it would surely give him
the loyalty and sympathy of his family. Which meant that Valerie
would listen to him; and, in the certainty of his family's ultimate
acquiescence, she would wear his ring and face with him the problems
and the sorrows that must come to all.</p>

<p>Cameron drove down to the station in the motor-car to meet him:</p>

<p>"Hello, Genius," he said, patting Neville on the back with a
pudgy hand. "How's your twin brother, Vice?"</p>

<p>"Hello, you large and adipose object!" retorted Neville, seating
himself in the tonneau. "How is that overworked, money-grubbing
intellect of yours staggering along?"</p>

<p>"Handicapped with precious thoughts; Ogilvy threw 'em into me
when he was here. How's the wanton Muse, Louis? Sitting on your
knees as usual?"</p>

<p>"One arm around my neck," admitted Neville, "and the band playing
'Sweethearts.'"</p>

<p>"Waiting for you to order inspiration cocktails. You're looking
fit."</p>

<p>"Am I? I haven't had one."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you threw one every time you painted that pretty
model of yours&mdash;" He looked sideways at Neville, but seeing that
he was unreceptive, shrugged.</p>

<p>"You're a mean bunch, you artists," he said. "I'd like to meet
that girl, but because I'm a broker anybody'd think I had rat-plague
from the way you all quarantine her&mdash;yes, the whole lot of you
&mdash;Ogilvy, Annan, Querida. Why, even Penrhyn Cardemon has
met her; he told me so; and if he has why can't I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake let up!" said Neville, keeping his temper,
"and tell me how everybody is at Ashuelyn."</p>

<p>"Huh! I'm ridden off as usual," grunted Cameron. "All right,
then; I'll fix it myself. What was it you were gracious enough
to inquire of me?"</p>

<p>"How the people are at Ashuelyn?" repeated Neville.</p>

<p>"How they are? How the deuce do I know? Your mother embroiders
and reads <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>; your father tucks his
hands behind him and critically inspects the landscape; and when
he doesn't do that he reads Herbert Spencer. Your efficient sister
nourishes her progeny and does all things thoroughly and well;
Gordon digs up some trees and plants others and squirts un-fragrant
mixtures over the shrubbery, and sits on fences talking to various
Rubes. Stephanie floats about like a well-fed angel, with a fox-terrier,
and makes a monkey of me at tennis whenever I'm lunatic enough
to let her, and generally dispenses sweetness, wholesomeness,
and light upon a worthy household. I wouldn't mind marrying that
girl," he added casually. "What do you think?"</p>

<p>Neville laughed: "Why don't you? She's the nicest girl I ever
knew&mdash;almost."</p>

<p>"I'd ask her to marry me," said Cameron facetiously; "only I'm
afraid such a dazzling prospect would turn her head and completely
spoil her."</p>

<p>He spoke gaily and laughed loudly&mdash;almost boisterously. Neville
glanced at him with a feeling that Cameron was slightly overdoing
it&mdash;rather forcing the mirth without any particular reason.</p>

<p>After a moment he said: "Sandy, you don't have to be a clown
if you don't want to be, you know."</p>

<p>"Can't help it," said Cameron, reddening; "everybody expects
it now. When Ogilvy was here we played in a double ring to crowded
houses. Every seat on the veranda was taken; we turned 'em away,
my boy. <em>What</em> was it you started to say about Stephanie?"</p>

<p>"I didn't start to say anything about Stephanie."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you were going to"&mdash;his voice died into an uncertain
grumble. Neville glanced at him again, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You know, Sandy," he said, "that there's another side to you&mdash;which,
for some occult reason you seem to hide&mdash;even to be ashamed of."</p>

<p>"Sure I'm ashamed to be a broker with all you highbrows lining
out homers for the girls while I have to sit on the bleachers
and score 'em up. If I try to make a hit with the ladies it's
a bingle; and it's the bench and the bush-league for muh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You great, overgrown kid! It's a pity people can't see you down
town. Everybody knows you're the cleverest thing south of Broad
and Wall. Look at all the boards, all the committees, all the
directorates you're mixed up with! Look at all the time you give
freely to others&mdash;look at all your charities, all your: civic
activities, all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All the hell I raise!" said Cameron, very red. "Don't forget
that, Louis!"</p>

<p>"You never did&mdash;that's the wonder and the eternal decency of
you, Cameron. You're a good citizen and a good man, and you do
more for the world than we painters ever could do! That's the
real truth of it; and why you so persistently try to represent
yourself as a commonplace something else is beyond me&mdash;and probably
beyond Stephanie Swift," he added carelessly.</p>

<p>They whizzed along in silence for some time, and it was only
when Ashuelyn was in sight that Cameron suddenly turned and held
out his hand:</p>

<p>"Thank you, Louis; you've said some very kind things."</p>

<p>Neville shrugged: "I hear you are financing that New Idea Home.
I tell you that's a fine conception."</p>

<p>But Cameron only looked modest. At heart he was a very shy man
and he deprecated any idea that he was doing anything unusual
in giving most of his time to affairs that paid dividends only
in happiness and in the consciousness of moral obligation fulfilled.</p>

<p>The household was occupying the pergola as they arrived and sprang
out upon the clipped lawn.</p>

<p>Neville kissed his mother tenderly, shook hands cordially with
his father, greeted Lily with a fraternal hug and Stephanie with
a firm grasp of both hands.</p>

<p>"How perfectly beautiful it is here!" he exclaimed, looking out
over the green valley beyond&mdash;and unconsciously his gaze rested
on the Estwich hills, blue and hazy and soft as dimpled velvet.
Out there, somewhere, was Valerie; heart and pulse began to quicken.
Suddenly he became aware that his mother's eyes were on him, and
he turned away toward the south as though there was also something
in that point of the compass to interest him.</p>

<p>Gordon Collis, following a hand-cart full of young trees wrapped
in burlap, passed across the lawn below and waved a greeting at
Neville.</p>

<p>"How are you, Louis!" he called out. "Don't you want to help
us set these hybrid catalpas?"</p>

<p>"I'll be along by and by," he replied, and turned to the group
under the pergola who desired to know how it was in town&mdash;the
first question always asked by New Yorkers of anybody who has
just arrived from that holy spot.</p>

<p>"It's not too warm," said Neville; "the Park is charming, most
of the houses on Fifth Avenue are closed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you chanced to pass through Tenth Street?" asked his father
solemnly.</p>

<p>But Neville confessed that he had not set foot in those sanctified
precincts, and his father's personal interest in Manhattan Island
ceased immediately.</p>

<p>They chatted inconsequentially for a while; then, in reply to
a question from Stephanie, he spoke of his picture, "A Bride,"
and, though it was still unfinished, he showed them a photograph
of it.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'It is very beautiful, Louis,' said his mother,
with a smile of pride."]</p>

<p>The unmounted imprint passed from hand to hand amid various comments.</p>

<p>"It is very beautiful, Louis," said his mother, with a smile
of pride; and even as she spoke the smile faded and her sad eyes
rested on him wistfully.</p>

<p>"Is it a sacred picture?" asked his father, examining it through
his glasses without the slightest trace of interest.</p>

<p>"It is an Annunciation, isn't it?" inquired Lily, calmly. But
her heart was failing her, for in the beauty of the exquisite,
enraptured face, she saw what might have been the very soul of
Valerie West.</p>

<p>His father, removing his spectacles, delivered himself of an
opinion concerning mysticism, and betrayed an illogical tendency
to drift toward the Concord School of Philosophy. However, there
seemed to be insufficient incentive; he glanced coldly toward
Cameron and resumed Herbert Spencer and his spectacles.</p>

<p>"Mother, don't you want to stroll on the lawn a bit?" he asked
presently. "It looks very inviting to a city man's pavement-worn
feet."</p>

<p>She drew her light wool shawl around her shoulders and took her
tall son's arm.</p>

<p>For a long while they strolled in silence, passed idly through
the garden where masses of peonies hung over the paths, and pansies,
iris, and forget-me-nots made the place fragrant.</p>

<p>It was not until they came to the plank bridge where the meadow
rivulet, under its beds of cress and mint, threaded a shining
way toward the woods, that his mother said in a troubled voice:</p>

<p>"You are not happy, Louis."</p>

<p>"Why, mother&mdash;what an odd idea!"</p>

<p>"Am I mistaken?" she asked, timidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, you are. I am very happy."</p>

<p>"Then," she said, "what is it that has changed you so?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'You are not happy, Louis.'"]</p>

<p>"Changed me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"I am not changed, mother."</p>

<p>"Do you think a mother can be mistaken in her only son? You are
so subdued, so serious. You are like men who have known sorrow....
What sorrow have you ever known, Louis?"</p>

<p>"None. No great one, mother. Perhaps, lately, I have developed&mdash;recognised&mdash;become
aware of the sombre part of life&mdash;become sensitive to it&mdash;to unhappiness
in others&mdash;and have cared more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You speak like a man who has suffered."</p>

<p>"But I haven't, mother," he insisted. "Of course, every painter
worries. I did last winter&mdash;last winter&mdash;" He hesitated, conscious
that last winter&mdash;on the snowy threshold of the new year&mdash;sorrow
and pain and happiness and pity had, in an instant, assumed for
him a significance totally new.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said slowly, "if I have changed it is only in a
better understanding of the world and those who live in it. I
have cared very little about people; I seem to have come to care
more, lately. What they did, what they thought, hoped, desired,
endured, suffered, interested me little except as it concerned
my work. And somehow, since then, I am becoming interested in
people for their own sakes. It's a&mdash;new sensation."</p>

<p>He smiled and laid his hand over hers:</p>

<p>"Do you know I never even appreciated what a good man Alexander
Cameron is until recently. Why, mother, that man is one of the
most generous, modest, kind, charitable, unselfish fellows in
the world!"</p>

<p>"His behaviour is sometimes a little extraordinary," said his
mother&mdash;"isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all on the surface! He's full of boyish spirits.
He dearly loves a joke&mdash;but the greater part of that interminable
funny business is merely to mask the modesty of a man whose particular
perversity is a fear that people might discover how kind and how
clever he really is!"</p>

<p>They walked on in silence for a while, then his mother said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Querida was here. Is he a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>Neville hesitated: "I'll tell you, mother," he said, "I don't
find Querida personally very congenial. But I have no doubt he's
an exceedingly nice fellow. And he's far and away the best painter
in America.... When did he go back to town?"</p>

<p>"Last week. I did not care for him."</p>

<p>"You and father seldom do care for new acquaintances," he rejoined,
smiling. "Don't you think it is about time for you to emerge from
your shells and make up your minds that a few people have been
born since you retired?"</p>

<p>"People have been born in China, too, but that scarcely interests
your father and me."</p>

<p>"Let it interest you, mother. You have no idea how amusing new
people are. That's the way to keep young, too."</p>

<p>"It is a little too late for us to think of youth&mdash;or to think
as youth thinks&mdash;even if it were desirable."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> desirable. Youth&mdash;which will be age to-morrow&mdash;may
venture to draw a little consideration in advance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My children interest me&mdash;and I give their youth my full consideration.
But I can scarcely be expected to find any further vital interest
in youth&mdash;and in the complexity of its modern views and ideas.
You ask impossibilities of two very old people."</p>

<p>"I do not mean to. I ask only, then, that you and father take
a vital and intelligent interest in me. Will you, mother?"</p>

<p>"Intelligent? What do you mean, Louis?"</p>

<p>"I mean," he said, "that you might recognise my right to govern
my own conduct; that you might try to sympathise with views which
are not your own&mdash;with the ideas, ideals, desires, convictions
which, if modern, are none the less genuine&mdash;and are mine."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence; then:</p>

<p>"Louis, are you speaking with any thought of&mdash;that woman in your
mind?" she asked in a voice that quivered slightly.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother."</p>

<p>"I knew it," she said, under her breath; "I knew it was that
&mdash;I knew what had changed you&mdash;was changing you."</p>

<p>"Have I altered for the worse?"</p>

<p>"I don't know &mdash;I don't know, Louis!" She was leaning heavily
on his elbow now; he put one arm around her and they walked very
slowly over the fragrant grass.</p>

<p>"First of all, mother, please don't call her, 'that woman.' Because
she is a very sweet, innocent, and blameless girl.... Will you
let me tell you a little about her?"</p>

<p>His mother bent her head in silence; and for a long while he
talked to her of Valerie.</p>

<p>The sun still hung high over the Estwich hills when he ended.
His mother, pale, silent, offered no comment until, in his trouble,
he urged her. Then she said:</p>

<p>"Your father will never consent."</p>

<p>"Let me talk to father. Will <em>you</em> consent?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;Louis&mdash;it would break our hearts if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not when you know her."</p>

<p>"Lily knows her and is bitterly opposed to her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, astounded. "You say that my sister knows
Valerie West?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>forgot," faltered his mother; "I ought not to have
said anything."</p>

<p>"Where did Lily meet her?" he asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me, Louis. I should not have spoken&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you should have! It is my affair; it concerns me&mdash;and it
concerns Valerie&mdash;her future and mine&mdash;our happiness. Where did
Lily meet her?"</p>

<p>"You must ask that of Lily. I cannot and will not discuss it.
I will say only this: I have seen the&mdash;this Miss West. She is
at present a guest at the villa of a&mdash;countess&mdash;of whom neither
your father nor I ever before heard&mdash;and whom even Lily knows
so slightly that she scarcely bows to her. And yesterday, while
motoring, we met them driving on the Estwich road and your sister
told us who they were."</p>

<p>After a moment he said slowly: "So you have actually seen the
girl I am in love with?"</p>

<p>"I saw &mdash;Miss West."</p>

<p>"Can't you understand that I <em>am</em> in love with her?"</p>

<p>"Even if you are it is better for you to conquer your inclination&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because all your life long you will regret such a marriage."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because nobody will care to receive a woman for whom you can
make no explanation&mdash;even if you are married to her."</p>

<p>He kept his patience.</p>

<p>"Will <em>you</em> receive her, mother?"</p>

<p>She closed her eyes, drew a quick, painful breath: "My son's
wife&mdash;whoever she may be&mdash;will meet with no discourtesy under
my roof."</p>

<p>"Is that the best you can offer us?"</p>

<p>"Louis! Louis!&mdash;if it lay only with me &mdash;I would do what
you wished&mdash;even this&mdash;if it made you happy&mdash;"</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and kissed her in silence.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," she said,&mdash;"it is not <em>I&mdash;</em>it
is the family&mdash;our entire little world against her. It would be
only an eternal, hopeless, heart-breaking struggle for you, and
for her;&mdash;pain for you&mdash;deep pain and resentment and bitterness
for those who did not&mdash;perhaps could not&mdash;take your views of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care, mother, as long as you and father and Lily stand
by her. And Valerie won't marry me unless you do. I didn't tell
you that, but it is the truth. And I'm fighting very hard to win
her&mdash;harder than you know&mdash;or will ever know. Don't embitter me;
don't let me give up. Because, if I do, it means desperation&mdash;and
things which you never could understand.... And <em>I</em> want
you to talk to father. Will you? And to Lily, too. Its fairer
to warn her that I have learned of her meeting Valerie. Then I'll
talk to them both and see what can be done.... And, mother, I
am very happy and very grateful and very proud that you are going
to stand by me&mdash;and by the loveliest girl in all the world."</p>

<p>That night Lily came to his room. Her eyes were red, but there
was fire in them. She seated herself and surveyed her brother
with ominous self-possession.</p>

<p>"Well, Lily," he said pleasantly, prepared to keep his temper
at all hazards.</p>

<p>"Well, Louis, I understand from mother that you have some questions
to ask me."</p>

<p>"No questions, little sister; only your sympathetic attention
while I tell you how matters stand with me."</p>

<p>"You require too much!" she said shortly.</p>

<p>"If I ask for your sympathy?"</p>

<p>"Not if you ask it for yourself, Louis. But if you include that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please, dear!" he interrupted, checking her with a slight gesture&mdash;for
an instant only; then she went on in a determined voice:</p>

<p>"Louis, I might as well tell you at once that I have no sympathy
for her. I wrote to her, out of sheer kindness, for her own good&mdash;and
she replied so insolently that&mdash;that I am not yet perfectly recovered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did you write?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Collis remained disdainfully silent, but her eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me," he asked, patiently, "what it was you wrote
to Valerie West?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll tell you if you insist on knowing!&mdash;even if you do
misconstrue it! I wrote to her&mdash;for her own sake&mdash;and to avoid
ill-natured comment,&mdash;suggesting that she be seen less frequently
with you in public. I wrote as nicely, as kindly, as delicately
as I knew how. And her reply was a practical request that I mind
my business!... Which was vulgar and outrageous, considering that
she had given me her promise&mdash;" Mrs. Collis checked herself in
her headlong and indignant complaint; then she coloured painfully,
but her mouth settled into tight, uncompromising lines.</p>

<p>"What promise had Valerie West made you?" he asked, resolutely
subduing his amazement and irritation.</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Collis hesitated; then, realising that matters
had gone too far for concealment, she answered almost violently:</p>

<p>"She promised me not to marry you,&mdash;if you must know! I can't
help what you think about it; I realised that you were infatuated&mdash;that
you were making a fatal and terrible mistake&mdash;ruining life for
yourself and for your family&mdash;and I went to her and told her so!
I've done all I could to save you. I suppose I have gained your
enmity by doing it. She promised me not to marry you&mdash;but she'll
probably break her word. If you mean to marry her you'll do so,
no doubt. But, Louis, if you do, such a step will sever all social
relations between you and your family. Because I will <em>not</em>
receive her! Nor will my friends&mdash;nor yours&mdash;nor father's and
mother's friends! And that settles it."</p>

<p>He spoke with great care, hesitating, picking and choosing his
words:</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;possible that you did&mdash;such a thing&mdash;as to write to Valerie
West&mdash;threatening her with my family's displeasure if she married
me?"</p>

<p>"I did not write her at first. The first time I went to see her.
And I told her kindly but plainly what I had to tell her! It was
my duty to do it and I didn't flinch."</p>

<p>Lily was breathing fast; her eyes narrowed unpleasantly.</p>

<p>He managed to master his astonishment and anger; but it was a
heavy draught on his reserve of self-discipline, good temper,
and common sense to pass over this thing that had been done to
him and to concentrate himself upon the main issue. When he was
able to speak again, calmly and without resentment, he said:</p>

<p>"The first thing for us to do, as a family, is to eliminate all
personal bitterness from this discussion. There must be no question
of our affection for one another; no question but what we wish
to do the best by each other. I accept that as granted. If you
took the step which you did take it was because you really believed
it necessary for my happiness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I still believe it!" she insisted; and her lips became a thin,
hard line.</p>

<p>"Then we won't discuss it. But I want to ask you one thing; have
you talked with mother about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;naturally."</p>

<p>"Has she told you all that I told her this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. It does not alter my opinion one particle," she
replied, her pretty head obstinately lowered.</p>

<p>He said: "Valerie West will not marry me if my family continues
hostile to her."</p>

<p>Lily slowly lifted her eyes:</p>

<p>"Then will you tell me why she permits herself to be seen so
constantly with you? If she is not going to marry you what <em>is</em>
she going to do? Does she care what people are saying about her?&mdash;and
about you?"</p>

<p>"No decent people are likely to say anything unpleasant about
either of us," he said, keeping a tight rein on himself&mdash;but the
curb was biting deeply now. "Mother will stand by me, Lily. Will
you?"</p>

<p>His sister's face reddened: "Louis," she said, "I am married;
I have children, friends, a certain position to maintain. You
are unmarried, careless of conventions, uninterested in the kind
of life that I and my friends have led, and will always lead.
The life, the society, the formalities, the conventional observances
are all part of our lives, and make for our happiness and self-respect;
but they mean absolutely nothing to you. And you propose to invade
our respectable and inoffensive seclusion with a conspicuous wife
who has been a notorious professional model; and you demand of
your family that they receive her as one of them! Louis, I ask
you, is this fair to us?"</p>

<p>He said very gravely: "You have met Valerie West. Do you really
believe that either the dignity or the morals of the family circle
would suffer by her introduction to it?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about her morals!" said his sister, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Then why condemn them?"</p>

<p>"I did not; I merely reminded you that she is a celebrated professional
model."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary to remind me. My mother knows it and will
stand by her. Will you do less for your own brother?"</p>

<p>"Louis! You are cruel, selfish, utterly heartless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am trying to think of everybody in the family who is concerned;
but, when a man's in love he can't help thinking a little of the
woman he loves&mdash;especially if nobody else does." He turned his
head and looked out of the window. Stars were shining faintly
in a luminous sky. His face seemed to have grown old and gray
and haggard:</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do," he said, as though speaking to himself;&mdash;"I
don't know where to turn. She would marry me if you'd let her;
she will never marry me if my family is unkind to her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What <em>will</em> she do, then?" asked Lily, coolly.</p>

<p>For a moment he let her words pass, then, turned around. The
expression of his sister's brightly curious eyes perplexed him.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked, disturbed.</p>

<p>"What I say, Louis. I asked you what Miss West means to do if
she does not marry you? Discontinue her indiscreet intimacy with
you?"</p>

<p>"Why should she?"</p>

<p>Lily said, sharply: "I would not have to put that question to
a modest girl."</p>

<p>"I have to put it to <em>you</em>!" he retorted, beginning to
lose his self-command. "Why should Valerie West discontinue her
friendship with me because my family's stupid attitude toward
her makes it impossible for a generous and proud girl to marry
me?"</p>

<p>Lily, pale, infuriated, leaned forward in her chair.</p>

<p>"Because," she retorted violently, "if that intimacy continues
much longer a stupid world and your stupid family will believe
that the girl is your mistress! But in that event, thank God,
the infamy will rest where it belongs&mdash;not on us!"</p>

<p>A cold rage paralysed his speech; she saw its ghastly reflection
on his white and haggard face&mdash;saw him quiver under the shock;
rose involuntarily, terrified at the lengths to which passion
had scourged her:</p>

<p>"Louis," she faltered&mdash;"<em>I&mdash;I </em>didn't mean that! &mdash;I
was beside myself; forgive me, please! Don't look like that; you
are frightening me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She caught his arm as he passed her, clung to it, pallid, fearful,
imploring,&mdash;"W-what are you going to do, Louis! Don't go, dear,
please. I'm sorry, I'm very, very humble. Won't you speak to me?
I said too much; I was wrong;&mdash;I &mdash;I will try to be different&mdash;try
to reconcile myself to&mdash;to what&mdash;you&mdash;wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked down at her where she hung to him, tearful face lifted
to his:</p>

<p>"I didn't know women could feel that way about another woman,"
he said, in a dull voice. "There's no use&mdash;no use&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but I love you dearly, Louis! I couldn't endure it to have
anything come between us&mdash;disrupt the family&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing will, Lily.... I must go now."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe I love you?"</p>

<p>He drew a deep, unconscious breath.</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Different people express love differently. There's
no use in asking you to be different&mdash;"</p>

<p>She said, piteously: "I'm trying. Don't you see I'm trying? Give
me time, Louis! Make allowances. You can't utterly change people
in a few hours."</p>

<p>He gazed at her intently for a moment.</p>

<p>"You mean that you are trying to be fair to&mdash;her?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>if you call it that;&mdash;yes! But a family can not
adapt itself, instantaneously, to such a cataclysm as threatens&mdash;I
mean &mdash;I mean&mdash;oh, Louis! Try to understand us and sympathise
a little with us!"</p>

<p>His arms closed around her shoulders:</p>

<p>"Little sister, we both have the family temper&mdash;and beneath it,
the family instinct for cohesion. If we are also selfish it is
not individual but family selfishness. It is the family which
has always said to the world, '<em>Noli me tangere</em>!' while
we, individually, are really inclined to be kinder, more sympathetic,
more curious about the neighbours outside our gate. Let it be
so now. Once inside the family, what can harm Valerie?"</p>

<p>"Dearest, dearest brother," she murmured, "you talk like a foolish
man. Women understand better. And if it is a part of your program
that this girl is to be accepted by an old-fashioned society,
now almost obsolete, but in which this family is merely a single
superannuated unit, that program can never be carried out."</p>

<p>"I think you are mistaken," he said.</p>

<p>"I know I am not. It is inevitable that if you marry this girl
she will be more or less ignored, isolated, humiliated, overlooked
outside our own little family circle. Even in that limited mob
which the newspapers call New York Society&mdash;in that modern, wealthy,
hard-witted, over-jewelled, self-sufficient league which is yet
too eternally uncertain of its own status to assume any authority
or any responsibility for a stranger without credentials,&mdash;it
would not be possible to make Valerie West acceptable in the slightest
sense of the word. Because she is too well known; her beauty is
celebrated; she has become famous. Her only chance there&mdash;or with
us&mdash;would have been in her absolute anonymity. Then lies <em>might</em>
have done the rest. But lying is now useless in regard to her."</p>

<p>"Perfectly," he said. "She would not permit it."</p>

<p>In his vacant gaze there was something changed&mdash;a fixedness born
of a slow and hopeless enlightenment.</p>

<p>"If that is the case, there is no chance," he said thoughtfully.
"I had not considered that aspect."</p>

<p>"I had."</p>

<p>He shook his head slightly, gazing through the window at the
starry lustre overhead.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care," he said, "if she would only marry me. If she'd
do that I'd never bother anybody&mdash;nor embarrass the family&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Louis!"</p>

<p>"I mean make any social demands on you.... And, as for the world&mdash;"
He slowly shook his head again: "We could make our own friends
and our own way&mdash;if she would only consent to do it. But she never
will."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say she will not marry you if you ask her?" began
Lily incredulously.</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"For your sakes&mdash;yours, and mother's, and father's&mdash;and for mine."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, then Lily said unsteadily:</p>

<p>"There&mdash;there seems to be a certain&mdash;nobility&mdash;about her....
It is a pity&mdash;a tragedy&mdash;that she is what she is!"</p>

<p>"It is a tragedy that the world is what it is," he said. "Good
night."</p>

<p>His father sent for him in the morning; Louis found him reading
the <em>Tribune</em> in his room and sipping a bowl of hot milk
and toast.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'What have you been saying to your mother?' he
asked."]</p>

<p>"What have you been saying to your mother?" he asked, looking
up through his gold-rimmed spectacles and munching toast.</p>

<p>"Has she not told you, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she has.... I think you had better make a trip around the
world."</p>

<p>"That would not alter matters."</p>

<p>"I differ with you," observed his father, leisurely employing
his napkin.</p>

<p>"There is no use considering it," said his son patiently.</p>

<p>"Then what do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to do."</p>

<p>"By that somewhat indefinite expression I suppose that you intend
to pursue a waiting policy?"</p>

<p>"A waiting policy?" His son laughed, mirthlessly. "What am I
to wait for? If you all were kind to Valerie West she might, perhaps,
consent to marry me. But it seems that even our own family circle
has not sufficient authority to protect her from our friends'
neglect and humiliation....</p>

<p>"She warned me that it would be so, long ago. I did not believe
it; I could not comprehend it. But, somehow, Lily has made me
believe it. And so have you. I guess it must be true. And if that's
all I have to offer my wife, it's not enough to compensate her
for her loss of freedom and happiness and self-respect among those
who really care for her."</p>

<p>"Do you give me to understand that you renounce all intentions
of marrying this girl?" asked his father, breaking more toast
into his bowl of milk.</p>

<p>"Yes," said his son, listlessly.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" said his father; "come here, my son."</p>

<p>They shook hands; the son's lifeless arm fell to his side and
he stood looking at the floor in silence. The father took a spoonful
of hot milk with satisfaction, and, after the younger man had
left the room, he resumed his newspaper. He was particularly interested
in the "Sunshine Column," which dispensed sweetness and light
under a poetic caption too beautiful to be true in a coldly humorous
world.</p>

<p>That afternoon Gordon Collis said abruptly to Neville:</p>

<p>"You look like the devil, Louis."</p>

<p>"Do I?"</p>

<p>"You certainly do." And, in a lower voice: "I guess I've heard
what's the matter. Don't worry. It's a thing about which nobody
ever ought to give anybody any advice&mdash;so I'll give you some.
Marry whoever you damn please. It'll be all the same after that
oak I planted this morning is half grown."</p>

<p>"Gordon," he said, surprised, "I didn't suppose <em>you</em>
were liberal."</p>

<p>"Liberal! Why, man alive! Do you think a fellow can live out
of doors as I have lived, and see germs sprout, and see mountain
ranges decay, and sit on a few glaciers, and swing a pick into
a mother-lode&mdash;and <em>not</em> be liberal? Do you suppose ten-cent
laws bother me when I'm up against the blind laws that made the
law-makers?&mdash;laws that made life itself before Christ lived to
conform to them?... I married where I loved. It chanced that my
marriage with your sister didn't clash with the sanctified order
of things in Manhattan town. But if your sister had been the maid
who dresses her, and I had loved her, I'd have married her all
the same and have gone about the pleasures and duties of procreation
and conservation exactly as I go about 'em now.... I wonder how
much the Almighty was thinking about Tenth Street when the first
pair of anthropoids mated? <em>Nobilitas sola est atque unica
virtus</em>. If you love each other&mdash;<em>Noli pugnare duobus.</em>
... And I'm going into the woods to look for ginseng. Want to
come?"</p>

<p>Neville went. Cameron and Stephanie, equipped with buckskin gloves,
a fox terrier, and digging apparatus, joined them just where the
slender meadow brook entered the woods.</p>

<p>"There are mosquitoes here!" exclaimed Cameron wrathfully. "All
day and every day I'm being stung down town, and I'm not going
to stand for it here!"</p>

<p>Stephanie let him aid her to the top of a fallen log, glancing
back once or twice toward Neville, who was sauntering forward
among the trees, pretending to look for ginseng.</p>

<p>"Do you notice how Louis has changed?" she said, keeping her
balance on the log. "I cannot bear to see him so thin and colourless."</p>

<p>Cameron now entertained a lively suspicion how matters stood,
and knew that Stephanie also suspected; but he only said, carelessly:
"It's probably dissipation. You know what a terrible pace he's
been going from the cradle onward."</p>

<p>She smiled quietly. "Yes, I know, Sandy. And I know, too, that
you are the only man who has been able to keep up that devilish
pace with him."</p>

<p>"I've led a horrible life," muttered Cameron darkly.</p>

<p>Stephanie laughed; he gave her his hand as she stood balanced
on the big log; she laid her fingers in his confidently, looked
into his honest face, still laughing, then sprang lightly to the
ground.</p>

<p>"What a really good man you are!" she said tormentingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, heaven! If you call me that I'm really done for!"</p>

<p>"Done for?" she exclaimed in surprise. "How?"</p>

<p>"Done for as far as you are concerned."</p>

<p>"I? Why how, and with what am I concerned, Sandy? I don't understand
you."</p>

<p>But he only turned red and muttered to himself and strolled about
with his hands in his pockets, kicking the dead leaves as though
he expected to find something astonishing under them. And Stephanie
glanced at him sideways once or twice, thoughtfully, curiously,
but questioned him no further.</p>

<p>Gordon Collis pottered about in a neighbouring thicket; the fox
terrier was chasing chipmunks. As for Neville he had already sauntered
out of sight among the trees.</p>

<p>Stephanie, seated on a dry and mossy stump, preoccupied with
her own ruminations, looked up absently as Cameron came up to
her bearing floral offerings.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sandy," she said, as he handed her a cluster of wild
blossoms. Then, fastening them to her waist, she glanced up mischieviously:</p>

<p>"How funny you are! You look and act like a little boy at a party
presenting his first offering to the eternal feminine."</p>

<p>"It's my first offering," he said coolly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sandy! With <em>your</em> devilish record!"</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said, "that I'm thirty-two years old? And that
you are twenty-two? And that since you were twelve and I was twenty
odd I've been in love with you?"</p>

<p>She looked at him in blank dismay for a moment, then forced a
laugh:</p>

<p>"Of course I know it, Sandy. It's the kind of love a girl cares
most about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's really love," said Cameron, un-smiling&mdash;"the kind I'm afraid
she doesn't care very much about."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'If you'll place a lump of sugar on my nose,
and say "when," I'll perform.'"]</p>

<p>She hesitated, then met his gaze with a distressed smile:</p>

<p>"You don't really mean that, Sandy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've meant it for ten years.... But it doesn't matter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sandy!... It <em>does</em> matter&mdash;if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't.... Come on and kick these leaves about and we'll
make a million dollars in ginseng!"</p>

<p>But she remained seated, mute, her gaze a sorrowful interrogation
which at length he could not pretend to ignore:</p>

<p>"Stephanie child, don't worry. I'm not worrying. I'm glad I told
you.... Now just let me go on as I've always gone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How <em>can</em> we?"</p>

<p>"Easily. Shut your eyes, breathe deeply, lifting both arms and
lowering them while counting ten in German&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sandy, don't be so foolish at&mdash;such a time."</p>

<p>"Such a time? What time is it?" pretending to consult his watch
with great anxiety. Then a quick smile of relief spread over his
features: "It's all right, Stephanie; it's my hour to be foolish.
If you'll place a lump of sugar on my nose, and say 'when,' I'll
perform."</p>

<p>There was no answering smile on her face.</p>

<p>"It's curious," she said, "how a girl can make a muddle of life
without even trying."</p>

<p>"But just think what you might have done if you'd tried! You've
much to be thankful for," he said gravely.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes, considering him:</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said, under her breath.</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Stephanie. You might have done worse; you might
have married me. Throw away those flowers&mdash;there's a good girl&mdash;and
forget what they meant."</p>

<p>Slowly, deliberately, blossom by blossom she drew them from her
girdle and laid them on the moss beside her.</p>

<p>"There's one left," he said cheerfully. "Raus mit it!"</p>

<p>But she made no motion to detach it; appeared to be unconscious
of it and of him as she turned her face and looked silently toward
the place where Neville had disappeared.</p>

<p>An hour or two later, when Gordon was ready to return to the
house, he shouted for Neville. Cameron also lifted up his voice
in a series of prolonged howls.</p>

<p>But Neville was far beyond earshot, and still walking through
woods and valleys and pleasant meadows in the general direction
of the Estwich hills.</p>

<p>Somewhere there amid that soft rolling expanse of green was the
woman who would never marry him. And it was now, at last, he decided
that he would never take her on any other terms even though they
were her own terms; that he must give her up to chance again as
innocent as chance had given her into his brief keeping. No, she
would never accept his terms and face the world with him as his
wife. And so he must give her up. For he believed that, in him,
the instinct of moral law had been too carefully developed ever
to be deliberately ignored; he still believed marriage to be not
only a rational social procedure, not only a human compromise
and a divine convention, but the only possible sanctuary where
love might dwell, and remain, and permanently endure inviolate.</p>
