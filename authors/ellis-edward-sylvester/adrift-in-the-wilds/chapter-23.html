<p>The bullet of the treacherous Indian had indeed whizzed harmlessly
by the head of Tim O'Rooney and when he fell to the bottom of
the canoe it was for the purpose of preventing any more of their
missiles passing too near him.</p>

<p>The savages, hastily driven to shelter by the unexpected shot
from the island, did not by any means relinquish their designs
upon the unfortunate white man in the canoe. He who had taken
the quick aim and fired saw that his bullet missed, but he understood
the disadvantage of his enemy, and was confident that he would
still fall into their hands.</p>

<p>As we have shown, when the Irishman was thus suddenly interrupted,
he was but a short distance from the shore. So abruptly compelled
to relinquish his paddle and simply shelter his person, the current
carried him quite rapidly down the stream.</p>

<p>Tim did not become sensible of his disadvantage until he had
drifted below the island, and then upon partly rising to use his
paddle the crack of a gun from the shore told him that he was
watched by vigilant eyes, and that <em>that</em> occupation was
vetoed most unmistakably.</p>

<p>Forced thus to act entirely on the defensive, he carefully drew
out his rifle and resting it on the body of his game waited his
chance to avenge himself upon the unrelenting savages. He could
tell from the faint blue smoke that curled upward where they were
concealed, but could not catch sight of them.</p>

<p>Had they shown themselves, the Irishman knew it was about impossible
for him to harm them at such a distance, while their dexterity
in the use of the gun made it too dangerous for him to expose
himself to their fire. He watched them until he had floated quite
a way below, when he began to hope that they had given up their
designs upon him, and he might make his way back to his friends
upon the island in safety.</p>

<p>But when on the point of rising to a sitting position he saw
them whisk through the bushes he knew they were following him
along the shore&mdash;following him, too, with that skill and stealth
which prevented his getting a shot at them, and placing it totally
out of his power to prevent himself from being "commanded by their
fire."</p>

<p>As may well be imagined, Howard and Elwood were deeply interested
spectators of these events. Now that they had revealed their presence
upon the island, and there was no further use in attempting to
conceal the fact, they were eager to render their companion all
the assistance possible.</p>

<p>But the nature of the occurrences made them helpless. Tim had
drifted such a distance down stream, and had consequently drawn
his enemies so far after him, that they had not the slightest
chance of reaching them with their rifles, if they chose to expose
themselves. They could only watch, therefore, and pray for their
safety.</p>

<p>Floating slowly onward, onward, they observed that Tim's canoe
gradually swerved to the left until it disappeared around a curve
in the river. It crossed the center and was nearer the western
than the eastern shore. This seemed to show that, despite his
unfavorable situation, he was able to impart a motion to the boat,
which, slight as it was, would eventually bring him to the opposite
side of the stream.</p>

<p>Nothing more was seen of the Indians, although the report of
several guns, heard within a half-hour of the disappearance of
the canoe, prevented their feeling too sanguine over the position
of Tim O'Rooney.</p>

<p>"We can now see the blunder he committed," said Howard. "He did
wrong in going to the eastern bank when he could have secured
his game as well upon the other side."</p>

<p>"I think he will be able to get away, unless they have a canoe
with which to follow him."</p>

<p>"Even then he can take to the woods and hide himself until dark,
and then make his way back to us."</p>

<p>"I hope so, but fear he will be prevented or overtaken before
he can reach shelter."</p>

<p>"But think, Howard, he has a gun and plenty of ammunition, and
there are but three of them. I should say they would hesitate
some time before advancing upon him."</p>

<p>"But he is a poor shot, like ourselves."</p>

<p>"He could not miss them if they came very close to him."</p>

<p>"Yes; there seems to be a good chance, if they don't find more
Indians to unite with them in the hunt."</p>

<p>This was a contingency that had not occurred to Elwood, and he
was almost overwhelmed at its import until he came to reason upon
it, when the likelihood of such being the case dwindled away until
it almost vanished.</p>

<p>"We have seen no large bodies of savages, and I don't believe
they care enough about catching or slaying a single man to go
to all that trouble."</p>

<p>"Not so much trouble, perhaps, as you are apt to think. War is
the business of the American Indians, you know, as it is of all
barbarous people."</p>

<p>"But look at Ned Trimble and his friends. There are but three
of them, and I have no doubt that their security is in their strength&mdash;otherwise
they would not be so indifferent as to what is going on around
them. You remember they did not see us until we first spoke to
them."</p>

<p>"So it appeared; but I have an idea that they knew of our presence
before Tim discovered them."</p>

<p>"They did not show it, at any rate."</p>

<p>"They looked surprised when we came up, but if we had been enemies
instead of friends I believe we would have been the surprised
parties. They have lived too long in the wilds of California to
permit a party of strangers to steal upon them unaware."</p>

<p>"But what is to become of us if Tim doesn't come back?"</p>

<p>"We shall have to put ourselves under the care of Shasta&mdash;that
is, if he gets well."</p>

<p>"Why do you call him <em>Shasta</em>? Where did you hear that
name?"</p>

<p>"The only word I have heard him speak sounded like that, and
I do not know of any better name. Can you think of one?"</p>

<p>"No; that is good enough; let him be called Shasta, then. There
may be a greater Providence in our coming upon this island than
we imagine."</p>

<p>"There is a Providence in everything that occurs, though it may
be that we are not always able to see it. Do you remember the
copy we had so often at school, 'Misfortunes are often blessings
in disguise?'"</p>

<p>"Yes; but like the truths that were driven into our heads so
often at school, we fail to appreciate them until some occasion
like this impresses them upon our minds. But I declare, Howard,
we are turning philosophers."</p>

<p>"What better can we do, when there is nothing else to employ
ourselves about? We need all our philosophy at such a time."</p>

<p>"But we must not forget our patient, Shasta."</p>

<p>"True. He had gone almost out of my mind until you referred to
him a moment ago. Let us look at him."</p>

<p>The two had been stationed near the lower end of the island,
and they now walked back to where they had left the suffering
stranger. What was their surprise to see him standing on his feet,
his blanket wrapped around him, and his attitude and position
such as to raise a strong suspicion that he understood all that
had taken place within the last hour or two.</p>
