<p>The Lady Catherine de Laval, in her own right Countess of Beaumanoir,
and mistress of fiefs and manors, rights of chase and warren,
mills and hospices, the like of which were not in Picardy, was
happy in all things but her family. Her one son had fallen in
his youth in an obscure fray in Guienne, leaving two motherless
boys who, after her husband's death, were the chief business of
life to the Countess Catherine. The elder, Aimery, grew to manhood
after the fashion of the men of her own house, a somewhat heavy
country gentleman, much set upon rustic sports, slow at learning,
and averse alike from camps and cities. The ambition of the grandmother
found nothing to feed upon in the young lord of Beaumanoir. He
was kind, virtuous and honest, but dull as a pool on a winter's
highway.</p>

<p>Catherine would fain have had the one youth a soldier and the
other a saint, and of the two ambitions she most cherished the
latter. The first made shipwreck on the rustic Aimery, and therefore
the second burned more fiercely. She had the promise from the
saints that her line had a great destiny, and the form of it she
took to be sanctitude. For, all her married days she had ruled
her life according to the canons of God, fasting and praying,
cherishing the poor, tending the afflicted, giving of her great
wealth bountifully to the Church. She had a name for holiness
as far as the coasts of Italy. Surely from the blood of Beaumanoir
one would arise to be in dark times a defender of the Faith, a
champion of Christ whom after death the Church should accept among
the beatified. Such a fate she desired for her seed more hungrily
than any Emperor's crown.</p>

<p>In the younger, Philip, there was hope. He had been an odd child,
slim and pale while Aimery was large and ruddy, shy where his
brother was bold and bold where he was shy. He was backward in
games and unready in a quarrel, but it was observed that he had
no fear of the dark, or of the Green Lady that haunted the river
avenue. Father Ambrose, his tutor, reported him of quick and excellent
parts, but marred by a dreaminess which might grow into desidia
that deadly sin. He had a peculiar grace of body and a silken
courtesy of manner which won hearts. His grey eyes, even as a
small boy, were serious and wise. But he seemed to dwell aloof,
and while his brother's moods were plain for all to read, he had
from early days a self-control which presented a mask to his little
world. With this stoicism went independence. Philip walked his
own way with a gentle obstinacy. "A saint, maybe," Father Ambrose
told his grandmother. "But the kind of saint that the Church will
ban before it blesses."</p>

<p>To the old dame of Beaumanoir the child was the apple of her
eye; and her affection drew from him a tenderness denied to others.
But it brought no confidences. The dreaming boy made his own world,
which was not, like his grandmother's, one of a dark road visited
rarely by angels, with heaven as a shining city at the end of
it; or, like his brother's, a green place of earthy jollity. It
was as if the Breton blood of the Lavals and Rohans had brought
to the solid stock of Beaumanoir the fairy whimsies of their dim
ancestors. While the moors and woodlands were to Aimery only places
to fly a hawk or follow a stag, to Philip they were a wizard land
where dreams grew. And the mysteries of the Church were also food
for his gold fancy, which by reshaping them stripped them of all
terrors. He was extraordinarily happy, for he had the power to
make again each fresh experience in a select inner world in which
he walked as king, since he was its creator.</p>

<p>He was a child of many fancies, but one especially stayed with
him. When still very small, he slept in a cot in his grandmother's
room, the walls of which were hung with tapestry from the Arras
looms. One picture caught his eye, for the morning sun struck
it, and when he woke early it glowed invitingly before him. It
represented a little river twining about a coppice. There was
no figure in the piece, which was bounded on one side by a great
armoire, and on the other by the jamb of the chimney; but from
extreme corner projected the plume of a helmet and the tip of
a lance. There was someone there; someone riding towards the trees.
It grew upon Philip that that little wood was a happy place, most
happy and desirable. He fancied himself the knight, and he longed
to be moving up the links of the stream. He followed every step
of the way, across the shallow ford, past the sedges of a backwater,
between two clumps of willows, and then over smooth green grass
to the edge of the wood. But he never tried to picture what lay
inside. That was sacred&mdash;even from his thoughts.</p>

<p>When he grew older and was allowed to prowl about in the scriptorium
of the Abbey of Montmirail which lay by the Canche side, he found
his wood again. It was in a Psaltery on which a hundred years
before some Flemish monk had lavished his gold and vermilion.
Opposite the verse of Psalm xxiii., "In loco pascuae," was a picture
almost the same as that in the bedroom arras. There were the river,
the meadows, and the little wood, painted in colours far brighter
than the tapestry. Never was such bloom of green or such depth
of blue. But there was a difference. No lance or plume projected
from the corner. The traveller had emerged from cover, and was
walking waist-deep in the lush grasses. He was a thin, nondescript
pilgrim, without arms save a great staff like the crozier of a
Bishop. Philip was disappointed in him and preferred the invisible
knight, but the wood was all he had desired. It was indeed a blessed
place, and the old scribe had known it, for a scroll of gold hung
above it with the words "Sylva Vitae."</p>

<p>At the age of ten the boy had passed far beyond Father Ambrose,
and was sucking the Abbey dry of its learning, like some second
Abelard. In the cloisters of Montmirail were men who had a smattering
of the New Knowledge, about which Italy had gone mad, and, by
the munificence of the Countess Catherine, copies had been made
by the Italian stationarii of some of the old books of Rome which
the world had long forgotten. In the Abbey library, among a waste
of antiphonaries and homilies and monkish chronicles, were to
be found texts of Livy and Lucretius and the letters of Cicero.
Philip was already a master of Latin, writing it with an elegance
worthy of Niccolo the Florentine. At fourteen he entered the college
of Robert of Sorbonne, but found little charm in its scholastic
pedantry. But in the capital he learned the Greek tongue from
a Byzantine, the elder Lascaris, and copied with his own hand
a great part of Plato and Aristotle. His thirst grew with every
draught of the new vintage. To Pavia he went and sat at the feet
of Lorenzo Vallo. The company of Pico della Mirandola at Florence
sealed him of the Platonic school, and like his master he dallied
with mysteries and had a Jew in his house to teach him Hebrew
that he might find a way of reconciling the Scriptures and the
classics, the Jew and the Greek. From the verses which he wrote
at this time, beautifully turned hexameters with a certain Lucretian
cadence, it is clear that his mind was like Pico's, hovering about
the borderland of human knowledge, clutching at the eternally
evasive. Plato's Banquet was his gospel, where the quest of truth
did not lack the warmth of desire. Only a fragment remains now
of the best of his poems, that which earned the praise of Ficino
and the great Lorenzo, and it is significant that the name of
the piece was "The Wood of Life."</p>

<p>At twenty Philip returned to Beaumanoir after long wanderings.
He was the perfect scholar who had toiled at books and not less
at the study of mankind. But his well-knit body and clear eyes
showed no marks of bookishness, and Italy had made him a swordsman.
A somewhat austere young man, he had kept himself unspotted in
the rotting life of the Italian courts, and though he had learned
from them suavity had not lost his simplicity. But he was more
aloof than ever. There was little warmth in the grace of his courtesy,
and his eyes were graver than before. It seemed that they had
found much, but had had no joy of it, and that they were still
craving. It was a disease of the time and men called it aegritudo.
"No saint," the aged Ambrose told the Countess. "Virtuous, indeed,
but not with the virtue of the religious. He will never enter
the Church. He has drunk at headier streams." The Countess was
nearing her end. All her days, for a saint, she had been a shrewd
observer of life, but with the weakening of her body's strength
she had sunk into the ghostly world which the Church devised as
an ante-room to immortality. Her chamber was thronged with lean
friars like shadows. To her came the Bishop of Beauvais, once
a star of the Court, but now in his age a grim watch-dog of the
Truth. To him she spoke of her hopes for Philip.</p>

<p>"An Italianate scholar!" cried the old man. "None such shall
pollute the Church with my will. They are beguiled by such baubles
as the holy Saint Gregory denounced, poetarum figmenta sive deliramenta.
If your grandson, madame, is to enter the service of God he must
renounce these pagan follies."</p>

<p>The Bishop went, but his words remained. In the hour of her extremity
the vision of Catherine was narrowed to a dreadful antagonism
of light and darkness &mdash;God and Antichrist&mdash;the narrow way
of salvation and a lost world. She was obsessed by the peril of
her darling. Her last act must be to pluck him from his temptress.
Her mood was fanned by the monks who surrounded her, narrow men
whose honesty made them potent.</p>

<p>The wan face on the bed moved Philip deeply. Tenderness filled
his heart, and a great sense of alienation, for the dying woman
spoke a tongue he had forgotten. Their two worlds were divided
by a gulf which affection could not bridge. She spoke not with
her own voice but with that of her confessors when she pled with
him to do her wishes.</p>

<p>"I have lived long," she said, "and know that the bread of this
world is ashes. There is no peace but in God. You have always
been the child of my heart, Philip, and I cannot die at ease till
I am assured of your salvation.... I have the prevision that from
me a saint shall be born. It is God's plain commandment to you.
Obey, and I go to Him with a quiet soul."</p>

<p>For a moment he was tempted. Surely it was a little thing this,
to gladden the dying. The rich Abbey of Montmirail was his for
the taking, and where would a scholar's life be more happily lived
than among its cool cloisters? A year ago, when he had been in
the mood of seeing all contraries but as degrees in an ultimate
truth, he might have assented. But in that dim chamber, with burning
faces around him and the shadow of death overhead, he discovered
in himself a new scrupulousness. It was the case of Esau; he was
bidden sell his birthright for pottage, and affection could not
gloze over the bargain.</p>

<p>"I have no vocation," he said sadly. "I would fain do the will
of God, but God must speak His will to each heart, and He does
not speak thus to me."</p>

<p>There was that in the words which woke a far-away memory of her
girlhood. Once another in a forest inn had spoken thus to her.
She stretched out her hand to him, and he covered it with kisses.</p>

<p>But in the night the priests stirred her fears again, and next
morning there was another tragic pleading, from which Philip fled
almost in tears. Presently he found himself denied her chamber,
unless he could give assurance of a changed mind. And so the uneasy
days went on, till in a dawn of wind amid a great praying and
chanting the soul of the Countess Catherine passed, and Aimery
reigned in Beaumanoir.</p>

<p>The place had grown hateful to Philip and he made ready to go.
For him in his recalcitrancy there was only a younger son's portion,
the little seigneury of Eaucourt, which had been his mother's.
The good Aimery would have increased the inheritance, but Philip
would have none of it. He had made his choice, and to ease his
conscience must abide strictly by the consequences. Those days
at Beaumanoir had plucked him from his moorings. For the moment
the ardour of his quest for knowledge had burned low. He stifled
in the air of the north, which was heavy with the fog of a furious
ignorance. But his mind did not turn happily to the trifling of
his Italian friends. There was a tragic greatness about such as
his grandmother, a salt of nobility which was lacking among the
mellow Florentines. Truth, it seemed to him, lay neither with
the old Church nor the New Learning, and not by either way could
he reach the desire of his heart.</p>

<p>Aimery bade him a reluctant farewell. "If you will not keep me
company here, I go to the wars. At Beaumanoir I grow fat. Ugh,
this business of dying chills me." And then with a very red face
he held out a gold ring. "Take it, Philip. She cherished it, and
you were her favourite and should wear it. God knows I have enough."</p>

<p>Likewise he presented him with a little vellum-bound book. "I
found this yesterday, and you being the scholar among us should
have it. See, the grandmother's name is written within."</p>

<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>It was a bright May morning when Philip, attended by only two
lackeys as became a poor man, rode over the bridge of Canche with
eyes turned southward. In the green singing world the pall lifted
from his spirits. The earth which God had made was assuredly bigger
and better than man's philosophies. "It would appear," he told
himself, "that like the younger son in the tale, I am setting
out to look for fortune."</p>

<p>At an inn in the city of Orleans he examined his brother's gift.
It was a volume of careful manuscript, entitled Imago Mundi, and
bearing the name of one Pierre d'Ailly, who had been Bishop of
Cambray when the Countess Catherine was a child. He opened it
and read of many marvels&mdash;how that the world was round, as Pythagoras
held, so that if a man travelled west he would come in time to
Asia where the sun rose. Philip brooded over the queer pages,
letting his fancy run free, for he had been so wrapped up in the
mysteries of man's soul that he had forgotten the mysteries of
the earth which is that soul's place of pilgrimage. He read of
cities with silver walls and golden towers waiting on the discoverer,
and of a river on whose banks "virescit sylva vitae." And at that
phrase he fell to dreaming of his childhood, and a pleasant unrest
stirred in his heart. "Aimery has given me a precious viaticum,"
he said.</p>

<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>He travelled by slow stages into Italy, for he had no cause for
haste. At Pavia he wandered listlessly among the lecture halls.
What had once seemed to him the fine gold of eloquence was now
only leaden rhetoric. In his lodging at Florence he handled once
again his treasures&mdash;his books from Ficino's press; his manuscripts,
some from Byzantium yellow with age, some on clean white vellum
new copied by his order; his busts and gems and intaglios. What
had become of that fervour with which he had been used to gaze
on them? What of that delicious world into which, with drawn curtains
and a clear lamp, he could retire at will? The brightness had
died in the air.</p>

<p>He found his friends very full of quarrels. There was a mighty
feud between two of them on the respective merits of Cicero and
Quintilian as lawgivers in grammar, and the air was thick with
libels. Another pair wrangled in public over the pre-eminence
of Scipio and Julius Caesar; others on narrow points of Latinity.
There was a feud among the Platonists on a matter of interpretation,
in which already stilettos had been drawn. More bitter still was
the strife about mistresses&mdash;kitchen-wenches and courtesans, where
one scholar stole shamelessly from the other and decked with names
like Leshia and Erinna.... Philip sickened at what he had before
tolerated, for he had brought back with him from the north a quickened
sense of sin. Maybe the Bishop of Beauvais had been right. What
virtue was there in this new knowledge if its prophets were apes
and satyrs! Not here grew the Wood of Life. Priapus did not haunt
its green fringes.</p>

<p>His mind turned towards Venice. There the sea was, and there
men dwelt with eyes turned to spacious and honourable quests,
not to monkish hells and heavens or inward to unclean hearts.
And in Venice in a tavern off the Merceria he spoke with destiny.</p>

<p>It was a warm evening, and, having dined early, he sought the
balcony which overlooked the canal. It was empty but for one man
who sat at a table with a spread of papers before him on which
he was intently engaged. Philip bade him good evening, and a face
was raised which promptly took his fancy. The stranger wore a
shabby grey doublet, but he had no air of poverty, for round his
neck hung a massive chain of gold, and his broad belt held a richly
chased dagger. He had unbuckled his sword, and it lay on the table
holding down certain vagrant papers which fluttered in the evening
wind. His face was hard and red like sandstone, and around his
eyes were a multitude of fine wrinkles. It was these eyes that
arrested Philip. They were of a pale brown as if bleached by weather
and gazing over vast spaces; cool and quiet and friendly, but
with a fire burning at the back of them. The man assessed Philip
at a glance, and then, as if liking what he found in him, smiled
so that white furrows appeared in his tanned cheeks. With a motion
of his hand he swept aside his papers and beckoned the other to
sit with him. He called on the drawer to bring a flask of Cyprus.</p>

<p>"I was about to have my evening draught," he said. "Will you
honour me with your company, sir?"</p>

<p>The voice was so pleasant that Philip, who was in a mood to shun
talk, could not refuse. He sat down by the board, and moved aside
a paper to make room for the wine. He noticed that it was a map.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Cambray had made him curious about such things.
He drew it to him, and saw that it was a copy of Andrea Bianco's
chart, drawn nearly half a century before, showing the Atlantic
Sea with a maze of islands stretching westwards.</p>

<p>The other shook his head. "A poor thing and out of date. Here,"
and he plucked a sheet from below the rest, "here is a better,
which Fra Mauro of this city drew for the great prince, Henry
of Portugal."</p>

<p>Philip looked at the map, which showed a misshapen sprawling
Africa, but with a clear ocean way round the south of it. His
interest quickened. He peered at the queer shapes in the dimming
light.</p>

<p>"Then there is a way to the Indies by sea?"</p>

<p>"Beyond doubt. I myself have turned the butt of Africa.... If
these matters interest you? But the thought of that dry land has
given me an African thirst. He, drawer!"</p>

<p>He filled his glass from a fresh bottle. "'Twas in June four
years back. I was in command of a caravel in the expedition of
Diaz. The court of Lisbon had a fit of cold ague and we sailed
with little goodwill; therefore it was our business to confound
the doubters or perish. Already our seamen had reached the mouth
of that mighty river they called the Congo, and clearly the butt
of Africa could not be distant. We had the course of Cam and Behaim
to guide us thus far, but after that was the darkness."</p>

<p>The man's face had the intent look of one who remembers with
passion. He told of the struggle to cross the Guinea Deep instead
of hugging the shore; of blue idle days of calm when magic fish
flew aboard and Leviathan wallowed so near that the caravels were
all but overwhelmed by the wave of him; of a storm which swept
the decks and washed away the Virgin on the bows of the Admiral's
ship; of landfall at last in a place where the forests were knee
deep in a muddy sea, strange forests where the branches twined
like snakes; of a going ashore at a river mouth full of toothed
serpents and giant apes, and of a fight with Behemoth among the
reeds. Then a second storm blowing from the east had flung them
seaward, and for weeks they were out of sight of land, steering
by strange stars. They had their magnets and astrolabes, but it
was a new world they had entered, and they trusted God rather
than their wits. At last they turned eastward.</p>

<p>"What distance before the turn?" Philip asked.</p>

<p>"I know not. We were far from land and no man can measure a course
on water."</p>

<p>"Nay, but the ancients could," Philip cried, and he explained
how the Romans had wheels of a certain diameter fixed to their
ships' sides which the water turned in its passing, and which
flung for each revolution a pebble into a tally-box.</p>

<p>The other's eyes widened. "A master device! I would hear more
of it. What a thing it is to have learning. We had only the hour-glass
and guesswork."</p>

<p>Then he told how on a certain day the crews would go no farther,
being worn out by storms, for in those seas the tides were like
cataracts and the waves were mountains. The admiral, Bartholomew
Diaz, was forced to put about with a heavy heart, for he believed
that a little way to the east he should find the southern cape
of Africa. He steered west by north, looking for no land till
Guinea was sighted. "But on the second morning we saw land to
the northward, and following it westward came to a mighty cape
so high that the top was in the clouds. There was such a gale
from the east that we could do no more than gaze on it as we scudded
past. Presently, still keeping land in sight, we were able to
bend north again, and when we came into calm waters we captains
went aboard the admiral's ship and knelt and gave thanks to God
for His mercies. For we, the first of mortals, had rounded the
butt of Africa and prepared the sea-road to the Indies."</p>

<p>"A vision maybe."</p>

<p>"Nay, it was no vision. I returned there under mild skies, when
it was no longer a misty rock, but a green mountain. We landed,
and set up a cross and ate the fruits and drank the water of the
land. Likewise we changed its name from the Cape of Storms, as
Diaz had dubbed it, to the Bona Esperanza, for indeed it seemed
to us the hope of the world."</p>

<p>"And beyond it?"</p>

<p>"Beyond it we found a pleasant country, and would doubtless have
made the Indies, if our ships had not grown foul and our crews
mutinous from fear of the unknown. It is clear to me that we must
establish a port of victualling in that southern Africa before
we can sail the last stage to Cathay."</p>

<p>The man spoke modestly and simply as if he were talking of a
little journey from one village to another. Something in his serious
calm powerfully caught Philip's fancy. In all his days he had
never met such a one.</p>

<p>"I have not your name, Signor," he said.</p>

<p>"They call me Battista de Cosca, a citizen of Genoa, but these
many years a wanderer. And yours?"</p>

<p>Philip gave it and the stranger bowed. The de Lavals were known
as a great house far beyond the confines of France.</p>

<p>"You contemplate another voyage?"</p>

<p>The brown man nodded. "I am here on the quest of maps, for these
Venetians are the princes of mapmaking. Then I sail again."</p>

<p>"To Cathay?"</p>

<p>A sudden longing had taken Philip. It was as if a bright strange
world had been spread before him compared with which the old was
tarnished and dingy.</p>

<p>Battista shook his head. "Not Cathay. To go there would be only
to make assurance of that which we already know. I have shown
the road: let others plan its details and build hostelries. For
myself I am for a bolder venture."</p>

<p>The balcony was filling up. A noisy group of young men were chattering
at one table, and at others some of the merchants from the Merceria
were at wine. But where the two sat it was quiet and dusky, though
without on the canal the sky made a golden mirror. Philip could
see his companion's face in the reflected light, and it reminded
him of the friars who had filled the chamber of his dying grandmother.
It was strained with a steadfast ardour.</p>

<p>Battista leaned his elbows on the board and his eyes searched
the other's.</p>

<p>"I am minded to open my heart to you," he said. "You are young
and of a noble stock. Likewise you are a scholar. I am on a mission,
Sir Philip&mdash;the loftiest, I think, since Moses led Israel over
the deserts. I am seeking a promised land. Not Cathay, but a greater.
I sail presently, not the African seas, but the Sea of Darkness,
the Mare Atlanticum." He nodded towards Bianco's map. "I am going
beyond the Ultimate Islands."</p>

<p>"Listen," he went on, and his voice fell very low and deep. "I
take it we live in these latter days of which the prophets spoke.
I remember a monk in Genoa who said that the Blessed Trinity ruled
in turn, and that the reign of the Father was accomplished and
that of the Son nearing its close; and that now the reign of the
Spirit was at hand. It may have been heresy &mdash;I am no scholar&mdash;but
he pointed a good moral. For, said he, the old things pass away
and the boundaries of the world are shifting. Here in Europe we
have come to knowledge of salvation, and brought the soul and
mind of man to an edge and brightness like a sword. Having perfected
the weapon, it is now God's will that we enter into possession
of the new earth which He has kept hidden against this day, and
He has sent His Spirit like a wind to blow us into those happy
spaces.... Now, mark you, sir, this earth is not a flat plain
surrounded by outer darkness, but a sphere hung in the heavens
and sustained by God's hand. Therefore if a man travel east or
west he will, if God prosper him, return in time to his starting-point."</p>

<p>The speaker looked at Philip as if to invite contradiction, but
the other nodded.</p>

<p>"It is the belief of the best sailors," Battista went on; "it
is the belief of the great Paolo Toscanelli in this very land
of Italy."</p>

<p>"It was the belief of a greater than he. The ancients&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, what of your ancients?" Battista asked eagerly.</p>

<p>Philip responded with a scholar's zest. "Four centuries before
our Lord's birth Aristotle taught the doctrine, from observing
in different places the rise and setting of the heavenly bodies.
The sages Eratosthenes, Hipparchus and Ptolemy amplified the teaching.
It is found in the poetry of Manilius and Seneca, and it was a
common thought in the minds of Virgil and Ovid and Pliny. You
will find it in St. Augustine, and St. Isidore and Beda, and in
many of the moderns. I myself have little knowledge of such things,
but on the appeal to high authority your doctrine succeeds.'</p>

<p>"What a thing is learning!" Battista exclaimed with reverence.
"Here have I and such as I been fumbling in the dark when the
great ones of old saw clearly!... It follows, then, that a voyage
westward will bring a man to Cathay?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly. But how will he return? If the earth is a sphere,
his course will be a descent, and on his way back he will have
to climb a great steep of waters."</p>

<p>"It is not so," said Battista vigorously. "Though why it is not
so I cannot tell. Travelling eastward by land there is no such
descent, and in this Mediterranean sea of ours one can sail as
easily from Cadiz to Egypt as from Egypt to Cadiz. There is a
divine alchemy in it which I cannot fathom, but the fact stands."</p>

<p>"Then you would reach Cathay by the west?"</p>

<p>"Not Cathay." The man's voice was very earnest. "There is a land
between us and Cathay, a great islandland beyond the Seven Cities
of Antillia."</p>

<p>"Cipango," said Philip, who had read Marco Polo's book in the
Latin version published a year or two before.</p>

<p>"Nay, not Cipango. On this side Cipango. Of Cipango the Venetians
have told us much, but the land I seek is not Cipango."</p>

<p>He drew closer to Philip and spoke low. "There was a Frenchman,
a Rochellois&mdash;he is dead these ten years&mdash;but I have spoken with
him. He was whirled west by storms far beyond Antillia, and was
gripped by a great ocean stream and carried to land. What think
you it was? No less than Hy-Brasil. There he found men, broad-faced
dusky men, with gentle souls, and saw such miracles as have never
been vouchsafed to mortals. 'Twas not Cipango or Cathay' for there
were no Emperors or cities, but a peaceful race dwelling in innocence.
The land was like Eden, bringing forth five harvests in the year,
and vines and all manner of fruits grew without tillage. Tortorel
was the man's name, and some thought him mad, but I judged differently.
I have talked with him and I have copied his charts. I go to find
those Fortunate Islands."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"I have friends. There is a man of my own city &mdash;Cristoforo
Colombo, they call him. He is a hard man and a bitter, but a master
seaman, and there is a fire in him that will not be put out. And
there may be others."</p>

<p>His steadfast burning eyes held Philip's.</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;what do you seek?" he asked.</p>

<p>Philip was aware that he had come to a cross roads in life. The
easy path he had planned for himself was barred by his own nature.
Something of his grandmother's blood clamoured within him for
a sharper air than the well-warmed chamber of the scholar. This
man, chance met in a tavern, had revealed to him his own heart.</p>

<p>"I am looking for the Wood of Life," he said simply and was amazed
at his words.</p>

<p>Battista stared at him with open mouth, and then plucked feverishly
at his doublet. From an inner pocket he produced a packet rolled
in fine leather, and shook papers on the table. One of these was
a soiled and worn slip of parchment, covered with an odd design.
"Look," he said hoarsely. "Tortorel's map!"</p>

<p>It showed a stretch of country, apparently a broad valley running
east to a seashore. Through it twined a river and on both sides
were hills dotted with trees. The centre seemed to be meadows,
sown with villages and gardens. In one crook of the stream lay
a little coppice on which many roads converged, and above it was
written the words "Sylva Vitae."</p>

<p>"It is the finger of God," said Battista. "Will you join me and
search out this Wood of Life?"</p>

<p>At that moment there was a bustle at the door giving on the main
room of the tavern. Lights were being brought in and a new company
were entering. They talked in high-pitched affected voices and
giggled like bona-robas. There were young men with them, dressed
in the height of the fashion; a woman or two, and a man who from
the richness of his dress seemed to be one of the princely merchants
who played Maecenas to the New Learning. But what caught Philip's
sight was a little group of Byzantines who were the guests of
honour. They wore fantastic headdresses and long female robes,
above which their flowing dyed beards and their painted eyebrows
looked like masks of Carnival time. After Battista's gravity their
vain eyes and simpering tones seemed an indecent folly. These
were the folk he had called friends, this the life he had once
cherished. Assuredly he was well rid of it.</p>

<p>He grasped Battista's hand.</p>

<p>"I will go with you," he said, "over the edge of the world."</p>

<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>As it happened Philip de Laval did not sail with Columbus in
that first voyage which brought him to San Salvador in the Bahamas.
But he and Battista were in the second expedition, when the ship
under the command of the latter was separated by a storm from
her consorts, and driven on a westerly course when the others
had turned south. It was believed to be lost, and for two years
nothing was heard of its fate. At the end of that time a tattered
little vessel reached Bordeaux, and Philip landed on the soil
of Franc. He had a strange story to tell. The ship had been caught
up by a current which had borne it north for the space of fifteen
days till landfall was made on the coast of what we now call South
Carolina. There it had been beached in an estuary, while the crew
adventured inland. The land was rich enough, but the tribes were
not the gentle race of Battista's imagining. There had been a
savage struggle for mastery, till the strangers made alliances
and were granted territory between the mountains and the sea.
But they were only a handful and Philip was sent back for further
colonists and for a cargo of arms and seeds and implements.</p>

<p>The French court was in no humour for his tale, being much involved
in its own wars. It may be that he was not believed; anyhow he
got no help from his king. At his own cost and with the aid of
friends he fitted out his ship for the return. After that the
curtain falls. It would appear that the colony did not prosper,
for it is on record that Philip in the year 1521 was living at
his house at Eaucourt, a married man, occupied with books and
the affairs of his little seigneury. A portrait of him still extant
by an Italian artist shows a deeply furrowed face and stern brows,
as of one who had endured much, but the eyes are happy. It is
believed that in his last years he was one of the first of the
gentlemen of Picardy to adhere to the Reformed faith.</p>
