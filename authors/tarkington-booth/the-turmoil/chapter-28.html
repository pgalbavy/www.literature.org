<p>It is the consoling attribute of unused books that their decorative
warmth will so often make even a ready-made library the actual
"living-room" of a family to whom the shelved volumes are indeed
sealed. Thus it was with Sheridan, who read nothing except newspapers,
business letters, and figures; who looked upon books as he looked
upon bric-a-brac or crocheting&mdash;when he was at home, and not abed
or eating, he was in the library.</p>

<p>He stood in the many-colored light of the stained-glass window
at the far end of the long room, when Roscoe and his wife came
in, and he exhaled a solemnity. His deference to the Sabbath was
manifest, as always, in the length of his coat and the closeness
of his Saturday-night shave; and his expression, to match this
religious pomp, was more than Sabbatical, but the most dismaying
of his demonstrations was his keeping his hand in his sling.</p>

<p>Sibyl advanced to the middle of the room and halted there, not
looking at him, but down at her muff, in which, it could be seen,
her hands were nervously moving. Roscoe went to a chair in another
part of the room. There was a deadly silence.</p>

<p>But Sibyl found a shaky voice, after an interval of gulping,
though she was unable to lift her eyes, and the darkling lids
continued to veil them. She spoke hurriedly, like an ungifted
child reciting something committed to memory, but her sincerity
was none the less evident for that.</p>

<p>"Father Sheridan, you and mother Sheridan have always been so
kind to me, and I would hate to have you think I don't appreciate
it, from the way I acted. I've come to tell you I am sorry for
the way I did that night, and to say I know as well as anybody
the way I behaved, and it will never happen again, because it's
been a pretty hard lesson; and when we come back, some day, I
hope you'll see that you've got a daughter-in-law you never need
to be ashamed of again. I want to ask you to excuse me for the
way I did, and I can say I haven't any feelings toward Edith now,
but only wish her happiness and good in her new life. I thank
you for all your kindness to me, and I know I made a poor return
for it, but if you can overlook the way I behaved I know I would
feel a good deal happier&mdash;and I know Roscoe would, too. I wish
to promise not to be as foolish in the future, and the same error
would never occur again to make us all so unhappy, if you can
be charitable enought to excuse it this time."</p>

<p>He looked steadily at her without replying, and she stood before
him, never lifting her eyes; motionless, save where the moving
fur proved the agitation of her hands within the muff.</p>

<p>"All right," he said at last.</p>

<p>She looked up then with vast relief, though there was a revelation
of heavy tears when the eyelids lifted.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said. "There's something else&mdash;about something
different &mdash;I want to say to you, but I want mother Sheridan
to hear it, too."</p>

<p>"She's up-stairs in her room," said Sheridan. "Roscoe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sibyl interrupted. She had just seen Bibbs pass through the hall
and begin to ascend the stairs; and in a flash she instinctively
perceived the chance for precisely the effect she wanted.</p>

<p>"No, let me go," she said. "I want to speak to her a minute first,
anyway."</p>

<p>And she went away quickly, gaining the top of the stairs in time
to see Bibbs enter his room and close the door. Sibyl knew that
Bibbs, in his room, had overheard her quarrel with Edith in the
hall outside; for bitter Edith, thinking the more to shame her,
had subsequently informed her of the circumstance. Sibyl had just
remembered this, and with the recollection there had flashed the
thought&mdash;out of her own experience&mdash;that people are often much
more deeply impressed by words they overhear than by words directly
addressed to them. Sibyl intended to make it impossible for Bibbs
not to overhear. She did not hesitate&mdash;her heart was hot with
the old sore, and she believed wholly in the justice of her cause
and in the truth of what she was going to say. Fate was virtuous
at times; it had delivered into her hands the girl who had affronted
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheridan was in her own room. The approach of Sibyl and
Roscoe had driven her from the library, for she had miscalculated
her husband's mood, and she felt that if he used his injured hand
as a mark of emphasis again, in her presence, she would (as she
thought of it) "have a fit right there." She heard Sibyl's step,
and pretended to be putting a touch to her hair before a mirror.</p>

<p>"I was just coming down," she said, as the door opened.</p>

<p>"Yes, he wants you to," said Sibyl. "It's all right, mother Sheridan.
He's forgiven me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheridan sniffed instantly; tears appeared. She kissed her
daughter-in-law's cheek; then, in silence, regarded the mirror
afresh, wiped her eyes, and applied powder.</p>

<p>"And I hope Edith will be happy," Sibyl added, inciting more
applications of Mrs. Sheridan's handkerchief and powder.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," murmured the good woman. "We mustn't make the worst
of things."</p>

<p>"Well, there was something else I had to say, and he wants you
to hear it, too," said Sibyl. "We better go down, mother Sheridan."</p>

<p>She led the way, Mrs. Sheridan following obediently, but when
they came to a spot close by Bibbs's door, Sibyl stopped. "I want
to tell you about it first," she said, abruptly. "It isn't a secret,
of course, in any way; it's something the whole family has to
know, and the sooner the whole family knows it the better. It's
something it wouldn't be <em>RIGHT </em>for us <em>ALL </em>not
to understand, and of course father Sheridan most of all. But
I want to just kind of go over it first with you; it'll kind of
help me to see I got it all straight. I haven't got any reason
for saying it except the good of the family, and it's nothing
to me, one way or the other, of course, except for that. I oughtn't
to've behaved the way I did that night, and it seems to me if
there's anything I can do to help the family, I ought to, because
it would help show I felt the right way. Well, what I want to
do is to tell this so's to keep the family from being made a fool
of. I don't want to see the family just made use of and twisted
around her finger by somebody that's got no more heart than so
much ice, and just as sure to bring troubles in the long run as&mdash;as
Edith's mistake is. Well, then, this is the way it is. I'll just
tell you how it looks to me and see if it don't strike you the
same way."</p>

<p>Within the room, Bibbs, much annoyed, tapped his ear with his
pencil. He wished they wouldn't stand talking near his door when
he was trying to write. He had just taken from his trunk the manuscript
of a poem begun the preceding Sunday afternoon, and he had some
ideas he wanted to fix upon paper before they maliciously seized
the first opportunity to vanish, for they were but gossamer. Bibbs
was pleased with the beginnings of his poem, and if he could carry
it through he meant to dare greatly with it&mdash;he would venture
it upon an editor. For he had his plan of life now: his day would
be of manual labor and thinking&mdash;he could think of his friend
and he could think in cadences for poems, to the crashing of the
strong machine&mdash;and if his father turned him out of home and out
of the Works, he would work elsewhere and live elsewhere. His
father had the right, and it mattered very little to Bibbs&mdash;he
faced the prospect of a working-man's lodging-house without trepidation.
He could find a washstand to write upon, he thought; and every
evening when he left Mary he would write a little; and he would
write on holidays and on Sundays&mdash;on Sundays in the afternoon.
In a lodging-house, at least he wouldn't be interrupted by his
sister-in-law's choosing the immediate vicinity of his door for
conversations evidently important to herself, but merely disturbing
to him. He frowned plaintively, wishing he could think of some
polite way of asking her to go away. But, as she went on, he started
violently, dropping manuscript and pencil upon the floor.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you heard it, mother Sheridan," she said,
"but this old Vertrees house, next door, had been sold on foreclosure,
and all <em>THEY </em>got out of it was an agreement that let's
'em live there a little longer. Roscoe told me, and he says he
heard Mr. Vertrees has been up and down the streets more'n two
years, tryin' to get a job he could call a 'position,' and couldn't
land it. You heard anything about it, mother Sheridan?"</p>

<p>"Well, I <em>DID </em>know they been doin' their own house-work
a good while back," said Mrs. Sheridan. "And now they're doin'
the cookin', too."</p>

<p>Sibyl sent forth a little titter with a sharp edge. "I hope they
find something to cook! She sold her piano mighty quick after
Jim died!"</p>

<p>Bibbs jumped up. He was trembling from head to foot and he was
dizzy&mdash;of all the real things he could never have dreamed in his
dream the last would have been what he heard now. He felt that
something incredible was happening, and that he was powerless
to stop it. It seemed to him that heavy blows were falling on
his head and upon Mary's; it seemed to him that he and Mary were
being struck and beaten physically&mdash;and that something hideous
impended. He wanted to shout to Sibyl to be silent, but he could
not; he could only stand, swallowing and trembling.</p>

<p>"What I think the whole family ought to understand is just this,"
said Sibyl, sharply. "Those people were so hard up that this Miss
Vertrees started after Bibbs before they knew whether he was <em>INSANE
</em>or not! They'd got a notion he might be, from his being in
a sanitarium, and Mrs. Vertrees <em>ASKED </em>me if he was insane,
the very first day Bibbs took the daughter out auto-riding!" She
paused a moment, looking at Mrs. Sheridan, but listening intently.
There was no sound from within the room.</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed Mrs. Sheridan.</p>

<p>"It's the truth," Sibyl declared, loudly. "Oh, of course we were
all crazy about that girl at first. We were pretty green when
we moved up here, and we thought she'd get us <em>IN&mdash;</em>but
it didn't take ME long to read her! Her family were down and out
when it came to money&mdash;and they had to go after it, one way or
another, <em>SOMEHOW! </em>So she started for Roscoe; but she
found out pretty quick he was married, and she turned right around
to Jim&mdash;and she landed him! There's no doubt about it, she had
Jim, and if he'd lived you'd had another daughter-in-law before
this, as sure as I stand here telling you the God's truth about
it! Well&mdash;when Jim was left in the cemetery she was waiting out
there to drive home with Bibbs! Jim wasn't <em>COLD&mdash;</em>and
she didn't know whether Bibbs was insane or not, but he was the
only one of the rich Sheridan boys left. She had to get him."</p>

<p>The texture of what was the truth made an even fabric with what
was not, in Sibyl's mind; she believed every word that she uttered,
and she spoke with the rapidity and vehemence of fierce conviction.</p>

<p>"What I feel about it is," she said, "it oughtn't to be allowed
to go on. It's too mean! I like poor Bibbs, and I don't want to
see him made such a fool of, and I don't want to see the family
made such a fool of! I like poor Bibbs, but if he'd only stop
to think a minute himself he'd have to realize he isn't the kind
of man <em>ANY </em>girl would be apt to fall in love with. He's
better-looking lately, maybe, but you know how he <em>WAS&mdash;</em>just
kind of a long white rag in good clothes. And girls like men with
some SO to 'em &mdash;<em>SOME </em>sort of dashingness, anyhow!
Nobody ever looked at poor Bibbs before, and neither'd she&mdash;no,
<em>SIR! </em>not till she'd tried both Roscoe and Jim first!
It was only when her and her family got desperate that she&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bibbs&mdash;whiter than when he came from the sanitarium&mdash;opened the
door. He stepped across its threshold and stook looking at her.
Both women screamed.</p>

<p>"Oh, good heavens!" cried Sibyl. "Were you in <em>THERE? </em>Oh,
I wouldn't&mdash;"  She seized Mrs. Sheridan's arm, pulling her toward
the stairway. "Come on, mother Sheridan!" she urged, and as the
befuddled and confused lady obeyed, Sibyl left a trail of noisy
exclamations: "Good gracious! Oh, I wouldn't&mdash;too bad! I didn't
<em>DREAM </em>he was there! I wouldn't hurt his feelings! Not
for the world! Of course he had to know <em>SOME </em>time! But,
good heavens&mdash;"</p>

<p>She heard his door close as she and Mrs. Sheridan reached the
top of the stairs, and she glanced over her shoulder quickly,
but Bibbs was not following; he had gone back into his room.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he looked&mdash;oh, terrible bad!" stammered Mrs. Sheridan. "I
&mdash;I wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Still, it's a good deal better he knows about it," said Sibyl.
"I shouldn't wonder it might turn out the very best thing could
happened. Come on!"</p>

<p>And completing their descent to the library, the two made their
appearance to Roscoe and his father. Sibyl at once gave a full
and truthful account of what had taken place, repeating her own
remarks, and omitting only the fact that it was through her design
that Bibbs had overheard them.</p>

<p>"But as I told mother Sheridan," she said, in conclusion, "it
might turn out for the very best that he did hear&mdash;just that way.
Don't you think so, father Sheridan?"</p>

<p>He merely grunted in reply, and sat rubbing the thick hair on
the top of his head with his left hand and looking at the fire.
He had given no sign of being impressed in any manner by her exposure
of Mary Vertrees's character; but his impassivity did not dismay
Sibyl&mdash;it was Bibbs whom she desired to impress, and she was content
in that matter.</p>

<p>"I'm sure it was all for the best," she said. "It's over now,
and he knows what she is. In one way I think it was lucky, because,
just hearing a thing that way, a person can tell it's <em>SO&mdash;</em>and
he knows I haven't got any ax to grind except his own good and
the good of the family."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheridan went nervously to the door and stood there, looking
toward the stairway. "I wish &mdash;I wish I knew what he was
doin'," she said. "He did look terrible bad. It was like something
had been done to him that was &mdash;I don't know what. I never
saw anybody look like he did. He looked&mdash;so queer. It was like
you'd&mdash;" She called down the hall, "George!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm?"</p>

<p>"Were you up in Mr. Bibbs's room just now?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. He ring bell; tole me make him fiah in his grate. I done
buil' him nice fiah. I reckon he ain' feelin' so well. Yes'm."
He departed.</p>

<p>"What do you expect he wants a fire for?" she asked, turning
toward her husband. "The house is warm as can be, I do wish I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, quit frettin'!" said Sheridan.</p>

<p>"Well, I &mdash;I kind o' wish you hadn't said anything, Sibyl.
I know you meant it for the best and all, but I don't believe
it would been so much harm if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother Sheridan, you don't mean you <em>WANT </em>that kind
of a girl in the family? Why, she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I don't know," the troubled woman quavered. "If
he liked her it seems kind of a pity to spoil it. He's so queer,
and he hasn't ever taken much enjoyment. And besides, I believe
the way it was, there was more chance of him bein' willin' to
do what papa wants him to. If she wants to marry him&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sheridan interrupted her with a hooting laugh. "She don't!" he
said. "You're barkin' up the wrong tree, Sibyl. She ain't that
kind of a girl."</p>

<p>"But, father Sheridan, didn't she&mdash;"</p>

<p>He cut her short. "That's enough. You may mean all right, but
you guess wrong. So do you, mamma."</p>

<p>Sibyl cried out, "Oh! But just <em>LOOK </em>how she ran after
Jim&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She did not," he said, curtly. "She wouldn't take Jim. She turned
him down cold."</p>

<p>"But that's impossi&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's not. I <em>KNOW </em>she did."</p>

<p>Sibyl looked flatly incredulous.</p>

<p>"And <em>YOU </em>needn't worry," he said, turning to his wife.
"This won't have any effect on your idea, because there wasn't
any sense to it, anyhow. D'you think she'd be very likely to take
Bibbs&mdash;after she wouldn't take <em>JIM? </em>She's a good-hearted
girl, and she lets Bibbs come to see her, but if she'd ever given
him one sign of encouragement the way you women think, he wouldn't
of acted the stubborn fool he has&mdash;he'd 'a' been at me long ago,
beggin' me for some kind of a job he could support a wife on.
There's nothin' in it&mdash;and I've got the same old fight with him
on my hands I've had all his life&mdash;and the Lord knows what he
won't do to balk me! What's happened now'll probably only make
him twice as stubborn, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"SH!" Mrs. Sheridan, still in the doorway, lifted her hand. "That's
his step&mdash;he's comin' down-stairs." She shrank away from the door
as if she feared to have Bibbs see her. "I &mdash;I wonder&mdash;"
she said, almost in a whisper&mdash;"I wonder what he'd goin'&mdash;to do."</p>

<p>Her timorousness had its effect upon the others. Sheridan rose,
frowning, but remained standing beside his chair; and Roscoe moved
toward Sibyl, who stared uneasily at the open doorway. They listened
as the slow steps descended the stairs and came toward the library.</p>

<p>Bibbs stopped upon the threshold, and with sick and haggard eyes
looked slowly from one to the other until at last his gaze rested
upon his father. Then he came and stood before him.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you've had so much trouble with me," he said, gently.
"You won't, any more. I'll take the job you offered me."</p>

<p>Sheridan did not speak&mdash;he stared, astounded and incredulous;
and Bibbs had left the room before any of its occupants uttered
a sound, though he went as slowly as he came. Mrs. Sheridan was
the first to move. She went nervously back to the doorway, and
then out into the hall. Bibbs had gone from the house.</p>

<p>Bibbs's mother had a feeling about him then that she had never
known before; it was indefinite and vague, but very poignant&mdash;something
in her mourned for him uncomprehendingly. She felt that an awful
thing had been done to him, though she did not know what it was.
She went up to his room.</p>

<p>The fire George had built for him was almost smothered under
thick, charred ashes of paper. The lid of his trunk stood open,
and the large upper tray, which she remembered to have seen full
of papers and note-books, was empty. And somehow she understood
that Bibbs had given up the mysterious vocation he had hoped to
follow&mdash;and that he had given it up for ever. She thought it was
the wisest thing he could have done&mdash;and yet, for an unknown reason,
she sat upon the bed and wept a little before she went down-stairs.</p>

<p>So Sheridan had his way with Bibbs, all through.</p>
