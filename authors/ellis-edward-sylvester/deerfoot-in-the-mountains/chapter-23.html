<p>With George and Victor Shelton seated on the fallen tree on one
side of the camp fire, and Captains Lewis and Clark on the other,
these two famous explorers told the story of their expedition,
which must always retain an historical interest for all of us.</p>

<p>As early as 1785, while Jefferson was in Paris, he became impressed
with the value of the Northwest. This interest increased after
his return home, and when he became President he secured an appropriation
of twenty-five hundred dollars from Congress for the purpose of
defraying the expense of an exploration of the vast region to
the northwest of the Mississippi. This appropriation was made
in February, 1803.</p>

<p>The area of Louisiana was more than a million square miles, and
greater than that of the whole United States as it then existed.
It was purchased from France for the sum of fifteen million dollars,
the treaty to that effect between the two governments being ratified
in the summer of the year named. By this single transaction the
dominion of the United States was extended across the whole continent
of North America, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>

<p>The exploring party that entered this enormous region was under
the command of Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. It
will be noted that both of these officers held the same rank.
Military law does not permit the anomaly of equal authority, and
Clark was really the junior, but in point of fact the rights of
the two were the same. They were so considerate toward each other
that no difference ever arose, and "the actual command and conduct
of the expedition devolved upon each in exactly equal degree."</p>

<p>Lewis belonged to an old Virginia family and early displayed
enterprise, boldness and discretion. He won the promotion to a
captaincy at the age of twenty-two, and was barely thirty years
of age when called to take part in this memorable exploration.
Clark was also a native of Virginia, but his childhood had been
spent in Kentucky, whither his parents removed. He was a younger
brother of the more famous General George Rogers Clark, but for
whom the Allegheny Mountains instead of the Mississippi would
have been our western boundary after the close of the Revolution.
He was about thirty-three years old when he joined Lewis. He possessed
excellent qualities, and it may be said that no two persons could
have been selected who were better fitted to lead the score and
a half of men across the continent.</p>

<p>On July 5, 1803, Captain Lewis left Washington, hoping to gather
his men and materials in time to reach La Charrette, the upper
white settlement on the Missouri, and there spend the winter.
The inevitable delays followed, and the Spanish commandant of
the province, not having received official notice of the transfer,
would not allow the expedition to pass through the territory.
The explorers, therefore, went into camp for the winter at the
mouth of the Du Bois River, a little north of St. Louis, on the
eastern bank of the Mississippi. This point was left on May 14,
1804. Entering the Indian country the leaders held a council with
the Ottoes and Missouris, and by the distribution of gewgaws and
presents won the good will of the red men. Lewis and Clark named
the place of meeting Council Bluff, which is retained to this
day, although the site of the modern city is below the meeting
place and on the opposite, side of the river.</p>

<p>For a time the expedition acted the part of peacemaker among
the Indians. The officers patched up peace agreements between
the tribes that were on the verge of warfare, and made treaties
with the Yankton branch of the Sioux and the Ricaras. All these
natives were familiar with white men, having known both French
traders and the employees of the British Fur Company. The Indians
showed a friendly disposition toward the explorers, but their
wonder was unbounded at sight of the African servant, he being
the first of his race they had ever seen. With the waggery of
his nature this negro gravely informed them that he was really
a wild animal that had been caught and tamed. The simple folk
believed his fantastic yarns, which were emphasized by numerous
feats of strength on his part.</p>

<p>Progress up the river was slow, because of the many sand bars
and numerous curves of the stream. The hunters, who kept in advance,
secured large quantities of fresh meat, and dried a good deal
for the winter supply. The region of the Mandans was reached in
the latter part of October. There a fort was built and occupied
during the winter. This was in what is now McLean County, North
Dakota. The winter was very severe, and many of the men had their
hands and feet frostbitten, while the continual glare of the snow
caused a temporary blindness.</p>

<p>At this fort another interpreter was engaged. He was a Canadian,
whose wife was a member of the Snake tribe of Indians of the Rocky
Mountains. She was stolen when a child and brought east, where
she was bought by the Canadian, who made her his wife. She was
a remarkable woman, and the only one of her sex who accompanied
the party. When she set out she carried an infant barely two months
old. She not only stood the journey as well as any of the men,
but displayed a rare degree of intelligence. She remembered much
of the wild region through which the party had to pass, and smoothed
the way among her own race for the white invaders. She became
very popular with all the members, and deserved the praise which
the leaders gave her.</p>

<p>Six canoes were soon completed. The company made their start
April 7, 1805, sixteen going down stream with a barge laden with
curiosities of the region for President Jefferson, while thirty-two
formed the permanent party, which pressed into the great unknown
region spreading out before them. The names of all these explorers
are preserved in the archives of the War Department under the
title of "A roll of the men who accompanied Captains Lewis and
Clark on their late tour to the Pacific Ocean through the interior
of the continent of North America, showing their rank, with some
remarks on their respective merits and services."</p>

<p>Early as was the season, the men suffered much from mosquitoes.
Spring kept company with the expedition. Herds of deer, elk, buffaloes
and antelopes were seen grazing on the rich grass, and there seemed
no end to swans and geese. Passing the alkali regions, the party
reached, in the latter part of April, the mouth of a large river,
to which they gave the name of Yellowstone. Joseph Fields, of
Kentucky, ascended it for eight miles, and was the first white
man to do so. Rains, high winds and cold weather welcomed them
into the hills of Montana, and often the boats had to be dragged
along the banks by means of elk-skin cords. They were thus laboriously
making their way when, as has been shown, they were met by Deerfoot
and the Shelton brothers at the mouth of the Musselshell River.</p>

<p>The story of the Lewis and Clark expedition, therefore, ended
for George and Victor Shelton at the point named. It will not
be uninteresting, however, to sum up the history of one of the
most memorable enterprises connected with the development of the
West. Captains Lewis and Clark gained a great deal of valuable
knowledge from the boys, who had traversed a large part of the
region which they intended to explore. The excellent memories
and the marked intelligence of the youths were admired by the
officers.</p>

<p>A few days after the meeting between the two parties Lewis climbed
to the top of the highest elevation north of the river and gained
his first view of the Rocky Mountains, known at that time as the
Stony Mountains. All the numerous streams were described and named.
It has been charged against the explorers that they were lacking
in sentiment and imagination, for most of the names thus given
by them have been supplanted by others, but it cannot be said
that these changes have always been an improvement.</p>

<p>On the second day of summer the explorers had to face a puzzling
problem. A large branch flowing from the north was so similar
to the Missouri that it seemed it must be that river, while the
one hitherto accepted as such bore to the south. Which was the
branch that, according to the reports of the Indians, had its
rise in the Rocky Mountains, near the source of the Columbia?
To settle the question the party divided, one ascending either
branch. Upon reuniting it was agreed that the south branch was
the real Missouri. The northern stream was named the Maria. This
was another of the few instances in which the title given by the
explorers stuck.</p>

<p>The rapids five miles below the Falls of the Missouri were reached
on June 15. These had to be passed by a portage. An idea can be
formed of the great difficulties encountered when it is stated
that, although the portage was hardly eighteen miles long, it
took eleven days to make it. The men, however, were in high spirits,
and at night Peter Cruzatte added to the "gayety of nations" by
playing on his violin.</p>

<p>About the middle of August horses were obtained from the tribe
from which the Indian wife of the interpreter had been stolen.
The passage through the mountains or over the Divide caused the
greatest suffering of the expedition. The men had to cut their
way in many places through the brush, clamber over jagged stones
and climb such precipitous walls that several of their horses
were crippled. Then snow began falling and the nights became very
cold. Game seemed to have deserted the country, and the sufferers
had to eat all their supply of flour and parched corn. Beginning
with September 14, they were obliged to kill and eat some of their
horses, and even at that had to be very sparing or the supply
would have been exhausted.</p>

<p>Descending the western side of the mountains, however, they found
abundant edible roots, dried salmon and dried berries at the Indian
villages. The famishing men feasted so ravenously that most of
them became ill. New canoes were constructed, and leaving their
horses with a chief they started down the Clearwater and reached
the Columbia on October 16. Ten days were occupied in making the
portage of the falls and rapids, and on the morning of November
7, when the fog lifted, they saw in the distance the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>A month later the party went into winter quarters. It rained
eternally, the weather was chilly and their condition for a long
time was miserable in the extreme. The shelter built for themselves
was called Fort Clatsop. There they remained until March 23, 1806,
when the explorers set out on their return journey. They had to
face difficulties, hardships and sufferings again, but they had
learned from experience and were better prepared to do so. They
embarked on the Yellowstone July 24, and ten days later reached
its junction with the Missouri. At this point the men were driven
almost frantic by the mosquitoes. At midday, September 23, 1806,
they arrived at St. Louis, where the whole town turned out to
welcome them. There the party was disbanded, and, passing to their
various destinations, the Lewis and Clark expedition took its
place in history.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the chat between Lewis and Clark, Deerfoot
came quietly forward and sat down beside the Shelton boys. He
listened closely to all that was said. When the officers asked
questions, the Shawanoe left the answers to the brothers. But
more than once they were in doubt, and turned to him for aid.
His prompt response in every instance was noticed by the officers,
who, after a time, addressed their questions almost wholly to
him.</p>

<p>Finally, at a late hour, the visitors wrapped themselves in their
blankets and stretched out on the ground, with their feet turned
toward the blaze. The explorers always maintained a watch, for
though they felt no fear of the Indians they were subject to unpleasant
visits, as in the case when a bison swam a river and went plunging
like a steam engine through the camp. Moreover, the men had seen
enough of the grizzly bear to hold him in respectful awe, and
they did not intend to have any of the brutes steal a march upon
them.</p>

<p>The morning was clear and pleasant, and the explorers were astir
at an early hour. A breakfast was made from catfish and goose,
and a cordial farewell took place. The boys wished Captains Lewis
and Clark the best of fortune, and Lewis complimented them, and
especially Deerfoot, for the information they had given him of
the region through which they expected to force their way. In
return, Lewis advised his guests to bear directly to the south
and not to follow the course of the Missouri, as he and his company
had done. In fact, it would have been absurd for the three to
adopt any other plan. They could make no use of the current because
they had no boats, and if they procured them from the Indians
they could not be made to carry the horses. The distance was much
greater by the Lewis and Clark route, which held no attractions
to our friends. When, therefore, Victor Shelton told Captain Lewis
that his advice would be followed, he said that which had been
determined upon before the meeting of the two parties.</p>
