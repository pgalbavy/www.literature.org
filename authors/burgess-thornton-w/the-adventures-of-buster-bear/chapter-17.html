<p>A fallen hero is some one to whom every one has looked up as
very brave and then proves to be less brave than he was supposed
to be. That was the way with Buster Bear. When Little Joe Otter
had told how Farmer Brown's boy had been afraid at the mere sight
of one of Buster Bear's big footprints, they had at once made
a hero of Buster. At least some of them had. As this was the first
time, the very first time, that they had ever known any one who
lives in the Green Forest to make Farmer Brown's boy run away,
they looked on Buster Bear with a great deal of respect and were
very proud of him.</p>

<p>But now they had seen Buster Bear and Farmer Brown's boy meet
face to face; and while it was true that Farmer Brown's boy had
run away as fast as ever he could, it was also true that Buster
Bear had done the same thing. He had run even faster than Farmer
Brown's boy, and had hidden in the most lonely place he could
find in the very deepest part of the Green Forest. It was hard
to believe, but it was true. And right away everybody lost a great
deal of the respect for Buster which they had felt. It is always
that way. They began to say unkind things about him. They said
them among themselves, and some of them even said them to Buster
when they met him, or said them so that he would hear them.</p>

<p>Of course Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, who, because they can
fly, have nothing to fear from Buster, and who always delight
in making other people uncomfortable, never let a chance go by
to tell Buster and everybody else within hearing what they thought
of him. They delighted in flying about through the Green Forest
until they had found Buster Bear and then from the safety of the
tree tops screaming at him.</p>

<p>  "Buster Bear is big and strong;   His teeth are big; his claws
are long;   In spite of these he runs away   And hides himself
the livelong day!"</p>

<p>A dozen times a day Buster would hear them screaming this. He
would grind his teeth and glare up at them, but that was all he
could do. He couldn't get at them. He just had to stand it and
do nothing. But when impudent little Chatterer the Red Squirrel
shouted the same thing from a place just out of reach in a big
pine-tree, Buster could stand it no longer. He gave a deep, angry
growl that made little shivers run over Chatterer, and then suddenly
he started up that tree after Chatterer. With a frightened little
shriek Chatterer scampered to the top of the tree. He hadn't known
that Buster could climb. But Buster is a splendid climber, especially
when the tree is big and stout as this one was, and now he went
up after Chatterer, growling angrily.</p>

<p>How Chatterer did wish that he had kept his tongue still! He
ran to the very top of the tree, so frightened that his teeth
chattered, and when he looked down and saw Buster's great mouth
coming nearer and nearer, he nearly tumbled down with terror.
The worst of it was there wasn't another tree near enough for
him to jump to. He was in trouble this time, was Chatterer, sure
enough! And there was no one to help him.</p>
