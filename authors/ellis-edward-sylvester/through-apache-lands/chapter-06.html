<p>The hunter was within a hundred yards or so of the clump of trees,
when he suddenly checked his mustang, or rather the mustang checked
himself, at the light of a camp fire, which all at once flashed
out from among them.</p>

<p>"That's either Dick or a lot of varmints," he muttered. "I think
it's varmints, for I don't b'lieve he meant to wait there."</p>

<p>However, it was a question easily settled. He slid from his horse,
and, rifle in hand, stole forward in the direction of the grove,
moving as silently and stealthily as a shadow, while his beast
stood as if he were an equestrian statue awaiting the placing
of some metallic hero upon his back. A phantom itself could not
have glided forward with less noise than did he, and yet he was
fully twenty yards away from his destination, with his eyes fixed
upon the point of light, when he was discovered by some horse
that belonged to the stranger, or strangers, which gave out a
loud neigh, as a signal to his friends of the approach of danger.
At that moment, Tom dropped flat upon his face, as he had done
before at the approach of the Apaches, and the luxuriant grass
gathered about his form in such a way that he could not be seen
by anyone at a moderate distance. But close upon the heels of
the neigh came a low, tremulous whistle, scarcely uttered when
Tom replied in a precisely similar way, leaped to his feet and
trotted toward the grove.</p>

<p>"That's Dick!" he exclaimed to himself, the signals which they
had used being the same that they had adopted years before, when
approaching each other in a dangerous neighborhood.</p>

<p>The next minute the two met and shook hands. There were many
points of resemblance and difference between the two comrades.
Each was in middle life, embrowned, hardened, and toughened by
years of exposure and the wild life of the border; but Tom Hardynge
was taller, more sinewy and active than Dick Morris, who was below
the medium stature, with a stunted appearance; but he was a powerful
man, wonderfully skillful in the use of the rifle, and the two
friends together made the strongest possible kind of a team.</p>

<p>"Ah! that's the talk," exclaimed Tom, as he snuffed the odor
of the cooking meat by the camp fire. "I'm hungry enough to chaw
up my moccasins. What have you there&mdash;buffalo, mule or grizzly
bar?"</p>

<p>"Neither one," replied the other. "I fetched down an antelope
a couple of hours ago, and as I was expectin' you, I cooked enough
of it for both."</p>

<p>"You had to cook his hoofs and all to do that; but why don't
you spread the dining table?"</p>

<p>Little ceremony was indulged in at such a time. The toasting
meat, brown, crisp and juicy, was served in two equal portions,
each of immense size, and then, with no culinary articles but
their keen hunting knives, and their incisors, almost as keen,
they went at the business with the gusto of famishing wolves.
Meanwhile the two mustangs were feasting upon the rich grass which
grew abundantly about them, and so all members of the party were
enjoying themselves to the fullest extent.</p>

<p>The two hunters scarcely spoke while this piece of mastication
was going on. They understood each other so well that there was
no necessity of any hurry in the way of inquiry or conversation.
When at last they had filled themselves to repletion, they drew
their fingers through their bushy hair, using the latter by way
of napkins, and then, after a good long draught from the brook
running near at hand, lit their pipes and leaned back in the very
acme of bliss.</p>

<p>"How soon shall we start?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"In a couple of hours," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Think the Apaches are through by this time?"</p>

<p>"No doubt of it."</p>

<p>If the hunters seemed to exhibit indifference in referring to
the terrible occurrence, it was not because they felt thus; but
the lives which they led had accustomed them to such frightful
experiences.</p>

<p>"S'pose they've spared the younker?"</p>

<p>"Guess they have."</p>

<p>The conclusion to which both came was that the Apaches were incited
to this attack more by the desire to get possession of the lad
than by anything else, in view of the intense hatred with which
Colonel Chadmund was viewed by the hostile Indians of the Southwest.
He had been stationed over two years at Fort Havens, during which
his administration had been marked by extreme vigor, and he had
retaliated upon the Apaches especially in the severest way for
many outrages committed by them.</p>

<p>"Yas, they've gone for that little younker," added Dick Morris,
after the discussion had been continued for some time. "Of course
they haven't killed him; for that would have sp'iled their game.
The colonel, finding what they'd done, would come down on 'em
harder than ever, and you kin make up your mind they'd get the
worst of the bargain before he was through with 'em; but as long
as they hold the boy, you see, they've got the hands of the old
fellow tied, for he thinks a heap of his boy, and he'll do anything
to save him."</p>

<p>"And that's why he sends us arter him," said Tom.</p>

<p>"He knows that if he let a lot of the men go, they might get
all chawed up, and it wouldn't help the boy any, so he thinks
we kin get him out of their hands by some hocus pocus or other."</p>

<p>"And what do <em>you</em> think, Tom?" asked his companion, in
a confidential voice. "Is there much show for ever saving the
skulp of little Ned?"</p>

<p>His brother hunter looked into the fire for several minutes,
with a very serious expression upon his countenance. He was thinking
intently upon the situation, and trying to extract some comfort
from the prospect.</p>

<p>"Wal, Dick, you know as well as me that it's mighty hard to tell
in such a case. We've both got the best of hosses, that kin hold
thar own agin anythin' the reds can scare up; but if they go to
such pains to get the chap into thar hands, they'll take the same
pains to keep him thar."</p>

<p>"Exactly; but they won't be expectin' any such move as we're
at so early in the day, don't you see? and there's where we gain
the advantage by hurryin' on, afore they kin get off in the mountains
with him."</p>

<p>There seemed to be reason in this conclusion, and both agreed
upon it.</p>

<p>At the end of a couple of hours their horses had rested sufficiently,
and they were mounted again. They had trusted to the mustangs
to act as sentinels while they spent their time in eating and
talking, and, no alarm having been given, they were satisfied
that there was no one in the vicinity, and they rode off toward
the northeast, without any concern of present danger threatening
them. By this time the moon was in the sky; but a few clouds were
occasionally scudding before his face, so that the prairie was
not illuminated with as much clearness as upon the preceding night.
The two hunters galloped along at a swinging gallop, a rate of
speed which their mustangs were capable of continuing for hours
and which it was the purpose of the riders to keep up until their
destination was reached. Now and then, through the stillness of
the night, the cries of wild animals came to their ears, and once
or twice these sounded very much like signals from parties of
Indians.</p>

<p>Tom and Dick never once relaxed their vigilance, but, as far
as the gloom would permit, scanned the country about them in every
direction. Besides, they occasionally caught the glimmer of camp
fires, but they were all at such a distance that they paid no
attention to them, but continued on the even tenor of their way.</p>

<p>Just as day was breaking, they found themselves fairly among
the mountains. The wildest crags and peaks were all about them,
and they were compelled to keep close to the pass they were following.
This wound in and out among the fastnesses, not more than a hundred
feet in width in some places, while in others it was fully a quarter
of a mile broad. Here they were in constant apprehension of meeting
with their old enemies; but there was an air of solitude and desertion
about them that was impressive in the extreme. They halted but
a short time to let their animals "blow," while they themselves
made an observation. Still nothing new or alarming was discovered,
and they hurried forward as before.</p>

<p>Just as the sun reached meridian, the two hunters came upon that
place known as Devil's Pass, which they were certain had witnessed
a fearful tragedy during the previous twenty-four hours.</p>
