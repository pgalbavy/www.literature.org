<p>Lieutenant Russell held a long consultation with Nellie Dawson,
after the departure of Vose Adams. His first intention had been
to press their flight with all possible vigor, and, as will be
recalled, Adams carried away that belief with him.</p>

<p>"My view of matters has undergone a change," he said after a
time to his companion, who looked up in his face for an explanation.</p>

<p>"Instead of waiting until we reach Sacramento for a meeting with
your father, I believe it will be much better to have it as soon
as possible."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, though curious to say, she had been wavering
for some time in her belief.</p>

<p>"It will add to rather than lessen his anger, if he is obliged
to follow us that far, and the fact that he is in a city instead
of the mountains will not decrease his determination to do me
injury."</p>

<p>"What about those who are with him?"</p>

<p>"Your father is the only one to be considered. My proposal is
that we wait here till to-morrow morning until they come up; what
is your opinion?"</p>

<p>"I believe you are right; let us do so; I don't think father
will cast me off when I go to him."</p>

<p>The plan was carried out, though the young man felt more misgiving
than his companion suspected. He remained on guard a part of the
night, sharing the duty with Timon, whose almost human intelligence
made him as reliable as a trained scout himself.</p>

<p>Straight to the spot came the pursuers soon after daylight, when
the horses were saddled and bridled. Nellie was in a state of
feverish expectancy. When she caught sight of her father, leading
the others, she joyfully uttered his name and ran toward him with
outstretched arms.</p>

<p>"Father, my own father, are you not glad to see your Nellie?"</p>

<p>Still holding his Winchester half-raised, he glanced sternly
at her and replied:</p>

<p>"Come no nearer; you are no daughter of mine!"</p>

<p>She stopped as if shot, and with hands still outstretched stood
motionless, with her eyes fixed yearningly upon him. She was like
a marble statue, without the breath of life in her body. All were
silent. Even Timon looked from one to another without moving.
The whole thing was beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p>Then the dreadful truth seemed to force itself upon the consciousness
of the girl, who staggered backward to the nearest boulder, upon
which she sank and covered her face with her hands. She did not
weep, for her grief was too deep.</p>

<p>And who shall picture the sorrow that wrenched the heart strings
of the parent? There was a strange look on his face and his massive
frame trembled. But he quickly recovered his self-poise, and looking
away from his child, fixed his eyes upon Lieutenant Russell.</p>

<p>"It is with <em>you</em> that I have to settle."</p>

<p>"I am ready."</p>

<p>The young officer was standing beside his pony, with one arm
resting on the saddle, across which his rifle was supported, while
the other hand lay idly on his hip, and his body was borne upon
one foot. His pose was one of negligence, as if he and his animal
had taken position before the camera, and the world contained
no such thing as hatred and enmity. He looked calmly into the
angered countenance, while he waited for the next words of the
man who was impatient to send a bullet through his heart.</p>

<p>Wade Ruggles and Felix Brush would have been glad of the privilege
of doing this, but they felt that for the time they were out of
it. The right of calling Lieutenant Russell to account lay with
the father of Nellie. They had nothing to do or say until that
tragedy was ended, and they stood apart, silent, grim and watchful
of everything.</p>

<p>The coolness of the young man disconcerted the captain for the
moment. Feeling it unnecessary to hold his weapon, he lowered
the point, but, never once removing his eyes from the face of
the other, said:</p>

<p>"I will give you the same chance as myself for your life; though
you do not deserve to live, it shall never be said I took any
advantage over you. Each of us has a revolver and knows how to
use it; you may pace off the distance for yourself, but make it
short."</p>

<p>"Captain, I decline to fight you," replied Lieutenant Russell,
without a change of pose and in his usual voice.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded the other.</p>

<p>"You have saved my life on the battle field; we have been comrades;
we have drank from the same canteen; shoot me if you wish; I will
keep the position I now hold and you may stand where you are;
you have your Winchester in your hands; you have but to raise
it and it will be all over in a twinkling, but nothing that you
can say or do will induce me to harm one of your gray hairs."</p>

<p>This reply was unexpected to all, but it served if possible to
intensify the wrath of Captain Dawson. He shook with tempestuous
rage, and it was several seconds before he could command his voice.
Ruggles, Brush and Adams did not stir or whisper a word to one
another. The white-faced Nellie remained seated on the boulder,
but she lowered her hands and stared at the two, as if she could
not comprehend it all. Once she made a motion to rise, but sank
back and stared with a fixidity of gaze that went to the hearts
of the three spectators.</p>

<p>"You are a sneaking scoundrel to use those words," said Captain
Dawson, when able to command his voice; "all the past is wiped
out except that of the last two days; I shall shoot you for stealing
my child from me."</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked calmly into the countenance of the man,
and, lowering his tones almost to a whisper, that was perfectly
audible to all, replied:</p>

<p>"I am at your disposal."</p>

<p>From the moment Captain Dawson learned of the flight of his child,
he had been eager for but one thing,&mdash;the opportunity to draw
bead on the miscreant, without giving him an instant to prepare
for death. That opportunity was his but he hesitated. Something
that he could not explain, but which incensed him, held his hand
motionless.</p>

<p>But perhaps the end would have been the same, when he rallied
from the momentary struggle, had not his daughter awakened from
the daze that had held her mute and motionless. Like Pocahontas,
she sprang forward, with arms again outstretched, and with a faint
shriek, flung them about the form of her lover.</p>

<p>"Shoot father, if you will, but you shall kill me too!"</p>

<p>Felix Brush shivered and turning away his head, muttered in a
broken voice:</p>

<p>"My God, Wade! I can't stand this!"</p>

<p>Ruggles attempted to reply, but the words choked in his throat.
Still he and Adams kept their eyes upon the three before them.
Ruggles was on the point of interfering when Nellie Dawson averted
the necessity.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Russell was disconcerted. His lip quivered, and, with
infinite tenderness, he sought to loosen the arms that entwined
him, but she would not permit it.</p>

<p>"No, no, no! He shall not part us! Let him slay us both! Do not
repulse me! I will die with you!"</p>

<p>The situation of Captain Dawson was awful. He was scarcely himself.
The dainty form of his child could not fully shield the athletic
figure of Lieutenant Russell, strive as much as she might, and
the opening for the threatened shot was as clear as ever. Whether
he would have persisted in his intention can never be known, for
at that juncture the startling incidents were succeeded by one
still more startling and unexpected.</p>
