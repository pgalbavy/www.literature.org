<P>
Mr. Fentolin, on leaving the dining-room, steered his chair with
great precision through the open, wrought-iron doors of a small
lift at the further end of the hall, which Doctor Sarson, who
stepped in with him, promptly directed to the second floor.  Here
they made their way to the room in which Mr. Dunster was lying.
Doctor Sarson opened the door and looked in.   Almost immediately
he stood at one side, out of sight of Mr. Dunster, and nodded to Mr.
Fentolin.
<P>
"If there is any trouble," he whispered, "send for me.  I am better
away, for the present.  My presence only excites him."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin nodded.
<P>
"You are right," he said.  "Go down into the dining-room.  I am not
sure about that fellow Hamel, and Gerald is in a queer temper.  Stay
with them.  See that they are not alone."
<P>
The doctor silently withdrew, and Mr. Fentolin promptly glided past
him into the room.  Mr. John P. Dunster, in his night clothes, was
sitting on the side of the bed.  Standing within a few feet of him,
watching him all the time with the subtle intentness of a cat
watching a mouse, stood Meekins.  Mr. Dunster's head was still bound,
although the bandage had slipped a little, apparently in some
struggle.  His face was chalklike, and he was breathing quickly.
<P>
"So you've come at last!" he exclaimed, a little truculently.  "Are
you Mr. Fentolin?"
<P>
Mr. Fentolin gravely admitted his identity.  His eyes rested upon
his guest with an air of tender interest.  His face was almost
beautiful.
<P>
"You are the owner of this house - I am underneath your roof - is
that so?"
<P>
"This is certainly St. David's Hall," Mr. Fentolin replied.  "It
really appears as though your conclusions were correct."
<P>
"Then will you tell me why I am kept a prisoner here?"
<P>
Mr. Fentolin's expression was for a moment clouded.  He seemed hurt.
<P>
"A prisoner," he repeated softly.  "My dear Mr. Dunster, you have
surely forgotten the circumstances which procured for me the pleasure
of this visit; the condition in which you arrived here - only, after
all, a very few hours ago?"
<P>
"The circumstances," Mr. Dunster declared drily, "are to me still
inexplicable.  At Liverpool Street Station I was accosted by a
young man who informed me that his name was Gerald Fentolin, and
that he was on his way to The Hague to play in a golf tournament.
His story seemed entirely probable, and I permitted him a seat in
the special train I had chartered for Harwich.  There was an accident
and I received this blow to my head - only a trifling affair, after
all.  I come to my senses to find myself here.  I do not know exactly
what part of the world you call this, but from the fact that I can
see the sea from my window, it must be some considerable distance
from the scene of the accident.  I find that my dressing-case has
been opened, my pocket-book examined, and I am apparently a prisoner.
I ask you, Mr.  Fentolin, for an explanation."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin smiled reassuringly.
<P>
"My dear sir," he said, "my dear Mr. Dunster, I believe I may have
the pleasure of calling you - your conclusions seem to me just a
little melodramatic.  My nephew - Gerald Fentolin - did what I
consider the natural thing, under the circumstances.  You had been
courteous to him, and he repaid the obligation to the best of his
ability.  The accident to your train happened in a dreary part of
the country, some thirty miles from here.  My nephew adopted a
course which I think, under the circumstances, was the natural and
hospitable one.  He brought you to his home.  There was no hospital
or town of any importance nearer."
<P>
"Very well," Mr. Dunster decided.  "I will accept your version of
the affair.  I will, then, up to this point acknowledge myself your
debtor.  But will you tell me why my dressing-case has been opened,
my clothes removed, and a pocket-book containing papers of great
importance to me has been tampered with?"
<P>
"My dear Mr. Dunster," his host replled calmly, "you surely cannot
imagine that you are among thieves!  Your dressing-case was opened
and the contents of your pocket-book inspected with a view to
ascertaining your address, or the names of some friends with whom
we might communicate."
<P>
"Am I to understand that they are to be restored to me, then?" Mr.
Dunster demanded.
<P>
"Without a doubt, yes!"  Mr. Fentolin assured him.  "You, however,
are not fit for anything, at the present moment, but to return to
your bed, from which I understand you rose rather suddenly a few
minutes ago."
<P>
"On the contrary," Mr. Dunster insisted, "I am feeling absolutely
well enough to travel.  I have an appointment on the Continent of
great importance, as you may judge by the fact that at Liverpool
Street I chartered a special train.  I trust that nothing in my
manner may have given you offence, but I am anxious to get through
with the business which brought me over to this side of the water.
I have sent for you to ask that my pocket-book, dressing-case, and
clothes be at once restored to me, and that I be provided with
the means of continuing my journey without a moment's further delay."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin shook his head very gently, very regretfully, but also
firmly.
<P>
"Mr. Dunster," he pleaded, "do be reasonable.  Think of all you have
been through.  I can quite sympathise with you in your impatience,
but I am forced to tell you that the doctor who has been attending 
you since the moment you were brought into this house has absolutely
forbidden anything of the sort."
<P>
Mr. Dunster seemed, for a moment, to struggle for composure.
<P>
"I am an American citizen," he declared.  "I am willing to listen
to the advice of any physician, but so long as I take the risk, I
am not bound to follow it.
<P>
In the present case I decline to follow it.  I ask for facilities
to leave this house at once."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin sighed.
<P>
"In your own interests," he said calmly, "they will not be granted
to you."
<P>
Mr. Dunster had spoken all the time like a man struggling to
preserve his self-control.  There were signs now that his will was
ceasing to serve him.  His eyes flashed fire, his voice was raised.
<P>
"Will not be granted to me?" he repeated.  "Do you mean to say,
then, that I am to be kept here against my will?"
<P>
Mr. Fentolin made no immediate reply.  With the delicate fingers of
his right hand he pushed back the hair from his forehead.  He looked
at his questioner soothingly, as one might look at a spoiled child.
<P>
"Against my will?" Mr. Dunster repeated, raising his voice still
higher.  "Mr. Fentolin, if the truth must be told, I have heard of
you before and been warned against you.  I decline to accept any
longer the hospitality of your roof.  I insist upon leaving it.
If you will not provide me with any means of doing so, I will walk."
<P>
He made a motion as though to rise from the bed.  Meekins' hand very
gently closed upon his arm.  One could judge that the grip was like
a grip of iron.
<P>
"Dear me," Mr. Fentolin said, "this is really very unreasonable of
you!  If you have heard of me, Mr. Dunster, you ought to understand
that notwithstanding my unfortunate physical trouble, I am a person
of consequence and position in this county.  I am a magistrate,
ex-high sheriff, and a great land-owner here.  I think I may say
without boasting that I represent one of the most ancient families
in this country.  Why, therefore, should you treat me as though it
were to my interest to inveigle you under my roof and keep you there
for some guilty purpose?  Cannot you understand that it is for your
own good I hesitate to part with you?"
<P>
"I understand nothing of the sort," Mr. Dunster exclaimed angrily.
"Let us bring this nonsense to an end.  I want my clothes, and if
you won't lend me a car or a trap, I'll walk to the nearest railway
station."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin shook his head.
<P>
"I am quite sure," he said, "that you are not in a position to
travel.  Even in the dining-room just now I heard a disturbance for
which I was told that you were responsible."
<P>
"I simply insisted upon having my clothes," Mr. Dunster explained.
"Your servant refused to fetch them.  rerhaps I lost my temper.
If so, I am sorry.  I am not used to being thwarted."
<P>
"A few days' rest -" Mr. Fentolin began.
<P>
"A few days' rest be hanged!" Mr. Dunster interrupted fiercely.
"Listen, Mr. Fentolin," he added, with the air of one making a last
effort to preserve his temper, "the mission with which I am charged
is one of greater importance than you can imagine.  So much depends
upon it that my own life, if that is in danger, would be a mere
trifle in comparison with the issues involved.  If I am not allowed
to continue upon my journey at once, the consequences may be more
serious than I can tell you, to you and yours, to your own country.
There! - I am telling you a great deal, but I want you to understand
that I am in earnest.  I have a mission which I must perform, and
which I must perform quickly."
<P>
"You are very mysterious," Mr. Fentolin murinured.
<P>
"I will leave nothing to chance," Mr. Dunster continued.  "Send
this man who seems to have constituted himself my jailer out of
earshot, and I will tell you even more."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin turned to Meekins.
<P>
"You can leave the room for a moment," he ordered.  "Wait upon the
threshold."
<P>
Meekins very unwillingly turned to obey.
<P>
"You will excuse me, sir," he objected doubtfully, "but I am not at
all sure that he is safe."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin smiled faintly.
<P>
"You need have no fear, Meekins," he declared.  "I am quite sure
that you are mistaken.  I think that Mr. Dunster is incapable of
any act of violence towards a person in my unfortunate position.
I am willing to trust myself with him - perfectly willing, Meekins."
<P>
Meekins, with ponderous footsteps, left the room and closed the door
behind him.  Mr. Fentolin leaned a little forward in his chair.  It
seemed as though he were on springs.  The fingers of his right hand
had disappeared in the pocket of his black velvet dinner-coat.  He
was certainly prepared for all emergencies.
<P>
"Now, Mr. Dunster," he said softly, "you can speak to me without
reserve."
<P>
Mr. Dunster dropped his voice.  His tone became one of fierce
eagerness.
<P>
"Look here," he exclaimed, "I don't think you ought to force me to
give myself away like this, but, after all, you are an Englishman,
with a stake in your country, and I presume you don't want her to
take a back seat for the next few generations.  Listen here.  It's
to save your country that I want to get to The Hague without a
second's delay.  I tell you that if I don't get there, if the message
I convey doesn't reach its destination, you may find an agreement
signed between certain Powers which will mean the greatest diplomatic
humiliation which Great Britain has ever known.  Aye, and more than
that!"  Mr. Dunster continued.  "It may be that the bogey you've been
setting before yourself for all these years may trot out into life,
and you may find St. David's Hall a barrack for German soldiers
before many months have passed."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin shook his head in gentle disbelief.
<P>
"You are speaking to one," he declared, "who knows more of the
political situation than you imagine.  In my younger days I was in
the Foreign Office.  Since my unfortunate accident I have preserved
the keenest interest in politics.  I tell you frankly that I do not
believe you.  As the Powers are grouped at present, I do not believe
in the possibility of a successful invasion of this country."
<P>
"Perhaps not," Mr. Dunster replied eagerly, "but the grouping of
the Powers as it has existed during the last few years is on the
eve of a great change.  I cannot take you wholly into my confidence.
I can only give you my word of honour as a friend to your country
that the message I carry is her only salvation.  Having told you as
much as that, I do not think I am asking too much if I ask you for
my clothes and dressing-case, and for the fastest motor-car you can
furnish me with.  I guess I can get from here to Yarmouth, and from
there I can charter something which will take me to the other side."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin raised the little gold whistle to his lips and blew it
very softly.  Meekins at once entered, closing the door behind him.
He moved silently to the side of the man who bad risen now from the
bed, and who was standing with his hand grasping the post and his
eyes fixed upon Mr. Fentolin, as though awaiting his answer.
<P>
"Our conversation," the latter said calmly, "has reached a point,
Mr. Dunster, at which I think we may leave it for the moment.  You
have told me some very surprising things.  I perceive that you are
a more interesting visitor even than I had thought."
<P>
He raised his left hand, and Meekins, who seemed to have been
waiting for some signal of the sort, suddenly, with a movement of
his knee and right arm, flung Dunster hack upon the bed.  The man
opened his mouth to shout, but already, with lightning-like
dexterity, his assailant had inserted a gag between his teeth.
Treating his struggles as the struggles of a baby, Meekins next
proceeded to secure his wrists with handcuffs.  He then held his
feet together while he quietly wound a coil of cord around them.
Mr. Fentolin watched the proceedings from his chair with an air of
pleased and critical interest.
<P>
"Very well done, Meekins - very neatly done, indeed!" he exclaimed.
"As I was saying, Mr. Dunster," he continued, turning his chair,
"our conversation has reached a point at which I think we may
safely leave it for a time.  We will discuss these matters again.
Your pretext of a political mission is, of course, an absurd one,
but fortunately you have fallen into good hands.  Take good care of
Mr. Dunster, Meekins.  I can see that he is a very important
personage.  We must be careful not to lose sight of him."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin steered his chair to the door, opened it, and passed
out.  On the landing he blew his whistle; the lift almost immediately
ascended.  A moment or two later he glided into the dining-room.  The
three men were still seated around the table.  A decanter of wine,
almost empty, was before Doctor Sarson, whose pallid cheeks, however,
were as yet unflushed.
<P>
"At last, my dear guest," Mr. Fentolin exclaimed, turning to Hamel,
"I am able to return to you.  If you will drink no more wine, let
us have our coffee in the library, you and I.  I want to talk to
you about the Tower."
