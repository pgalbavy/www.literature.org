<p>Peter Rabbit's jump over the old barrel on the edge of the hill
was unexpected to Reddy Fox. In fact, Reddy was so close on Peter's
heels that he had no thought of anything but catching Peter. He
was running so fast that when Peter made his flying jump over
the barrel, Reddy did not have time to jump too, and he ran right
smack bang against that old barrel. Now you remember that that
barrel was right on the edge of the hill. When Reddy ran against
it, he hit it so hard that he rolled it over, and of course that
started it down the hill. You know a barrel is a very rolly sort
of thing, and once it has started down a hill, nothing can stop
it.</p>

<p>It was just so this time. Reddy Fox had no more than picked himself
up when the barrel was half way down the hill and going faster
and faster. It bounced along over the ground, and every time it
hit a little hummock it seemed to jump right up in the air. And
all the time it was making the strangest noises. Reddy quite forgot
the smarting sore places where he had bumped into the barrel.
He simply stood and stared at the runaway.</p>

<p>"As I live," he exclaimed, "I believe there was some one in that
old barrel!" There was. You remember that Jimmy Skunk had curled
up in there for a nap. Now Jimmy was awake, very much awake. You
see, for once in his life he was moving fast, very much faster
than ever he had moved before since he was born. And it wasn't
at all comfortable. No, Sir, it wasn't at all a comfortable way
in which to travel. He went over and over so fast that it made
him dizzy. First he was right side up and then wrong side up,
so fast that he couldn't tell which side up he was. And every
time that old barrel jumped when it went over a hummock, Jimmy
was tossed up so that he hit whatever part of the barrel happened
to be above him. Of course, he couldn't get out, because he was
rolled over and over so fast that he didn't have a chance to try.</p>

<p>Now Reddy didn't know who was in the barrel. He just knew by
the sounds that some one was. So he started down the hill after
the barrel to see what would happen when it stopped. All the time
Peter Rabbit was dancing about in the greatest excitement, but
taking the greatest care to keep close to that old house of Johnny
Chuck's so as to pop into it in case of danger. He saw that Reddy
Fox had quite forgotten all about him in his curiosity as to who
was in the barrel, and he chuckled as he thought of what might
happen when the barrel stopped rolling and Reddy found out. Sammy
Jay was flying overhead, screaming enough to split his throat.
Altogether, it was quite the most exciting thing Peter had ever
seen.</p>

<p>Now it just happened that Old Man Coyote had started to cross
the Green Meadows right at the foot of the hill just as the barrel
started down. Of course, he heard the noise and looked up to see
what it meant. When he saw that barrel rushing right down at him,
it frightened him so that he just gave one yelp and started for
the Old Pasture like a gray streak. He gave Peter a chance to
see just how fast he can run, and Peter made up his mind right
then that he never would run a race with Old Man Coyote.</p>

<p>Down at the bottom of the hill was a big stone, and when the
barrel hit this, the hoops broke, and the barrel fell all apart.
Peter decided that it was high time for him to get out of sight.
So he dodged into the old house of Johnny Chuck and lay low in
the doorway, where he could watch. He saw Jimmy Skunk lay perfectly
still, and a great fear crept into his heart. Had Jimmy been killed?
He hadn't once thought of what might happen to Jimmy when he planned
that joke. But presently Jimmy began to wave first one leg and
then another, as if to make sure that he had some legs left. Then
slowly he rolled over and got on to his feet. Peter breathed a
sigh of relief.</p>
