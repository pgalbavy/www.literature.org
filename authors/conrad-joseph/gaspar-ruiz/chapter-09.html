<p> <em>WITH </em>movements of mechanical care and an air of abstraction
old General Santierra lighted a long and thick cigar.</p>

<p>"It was a good many hours before we could send a party back to
the ravine," he said to his guests. "We had found one-third of
the town laid low, the rest shaken up; and the inhabitants, rich
and poor, reduced to the same state of distraction by the universal
disaster. The affected cheerfulness of some contrasted with the
despair of others. In the general confusion a number of reckless
thieves, without fear of God or man, became a danger to those
who from the downfall of their homes had managed to save some
valuables. Crying ‘Misericordia’ louder than any at every tremor,
and beating their breasts with one hand, these scoundrels robbed
the poor victims with the other, not even stopping short of murder.</p>

<p>"General Robles’ division was occupied entirely in guarding the
destroyed quarters of the town from the depredations of these
inhuman monsters. Taken up with my duties of orderly officer,
it was only in the morning that I could assure myself of the safety
of my own family.</p>

<p>"My mother and my sisters had escaped with their lives from that
ball-room, where I had left them early in the evening. I remember
those two beautiful young women &mdash;God rest their souls&mdash;as
if I saw them this moment, in the garden of our destroyed house,
pale but active, assisting some of our poor neighbours, in their
soiled ball-dresses and with the dust of fallen walls on their
hair. As to my mother, she had a stoical soul in her frail body.
Half-covered by a costly shawl, she was lying on a rustic seat
by the side of an ornamental basin whose fountain had ceased to
play for ever on that night.</p>

<p>"I had hardly had time to embrace them all with transports of
joy, when my chief, coming along, dispatched me to the ravine
with a few soldiers, to bring in my strong man, as he called him,
and that pale girl.</p>

<p>"But there was no one for us to bring in. A land-slide had covered
the ruins of the house; and it was like a large mound of earth
with only the ends of some timbers visible here and there&mdash;nothing
more.</p>

<p>"Thus were the tribulations of the old Royalist couple ended.
An enormous and unconsecrated grave had swallowed them up alive,
in their unhappy obstinacy against the will of a people to be
free. And their daughter was gone.</p>

<p>"That Gaspar Ruiz had carried her off I understood very well.
But as the case was not foreseen, I had no instructions to pursue
them. And certainly I had no desire to do so. I had grown mistrustful
of my interference. It had never been successful, and had not
even appeared creditable. He was gone. Well, let him go. And he
had carried off the Royalist girl! Nothing better. Vaya con Dios.
This was not the time to bother about a deserter who, justly or
unjustly, ought to have been dead, and a girl for whom it would
have been better to have never been born.</p>

<p>"So I marched my men back to the town.</p>

<p>"After a few days, order having been re-established, all the
principal families, including my own, left for Santiago. We had
a fine house there. At the same time the division of Robles was
moved to new cantonments near the capital. This change suited
very well the state of my domestic and amorous feelings.</p>

<p>"One night, rather late, I was called to my chief. I found General
Robles in his quarters, at ease, with his uniform off, drinking
neat brandy out of a tumbler&mdash;as a precaution, he used to say,
against the sleeplessness induced by the bites of mosquitoes.
He was a good soldier, and he taught me the art and practice of
war.</p>

<p>"No doubt God has been merciful to his soul; for his motives
were never other than patriotic, if his character was irascible.
As to the use of mosquito nets, he considered it effeminate, shameful&mdash;unworthy
of a soldier.</p>

<p>"I noticed at the first glance that his face, already very red,
wore an expression of high good-humour.</p>

<p>"‘Aha! senor teniente,’ he cried loudly, as I saluted at the
door. ‘Behold! Your strong man has turned up again.’</p>

<p>"He extended to me a folded letter, which I saw was superscribed
‘To the Commander-in-Chief of the Republican Armies.’</p>

<p>"‘This,’ General Robles went on in his loud voice, ‘was thrust
by a boy into the hand of a sentry at the Quartel General, while
the fellow stood there thinking of his girl, no doubt&mdash;for before
he could gather his wits together, the boy had disappeared amongst
the market people, and he protests he could not recognise him
to save his life.’</p>

<p>"My chief told me further that the soldier had given the letter
to the sergeant of the guard, and that ultimately it had reached
the hands of our generalissimo. His Excellency had deigned to
take cognisance of it with his own eyes. After that he had referred
the matter in confidence to General Robles.</p>

<p>"The letter, senores, I cannot now recollect textually. I saw
the signature of Gaspar Ruiz. He was an audacious fellow. He had
snatched a soul for himself out of a cataclysm, remember. And
now it was that soul which had dictated the terms of his letter.
Its tone was very independent. I remember it struck me at the
time as noble&mdash;dignified. It was, no doubt, her letter. Now I
shudder at the depth of its duplicity. Gaspar Ruiz was made to
complain of the injustice of which he had been a victim. He invoked
his previous record of fidelity and courage. Having been saved
from death by the miraculous interposition of Providence, he could
think of nothing but of retrieving his character. This, he wrote,
he could not hope to do in the ranks as a discredited soldier
still under suspicion. He had the means to give a striking proof
of his fidelity. And he ended by proposing to the General-in-Chief
a meeting at midnight in the middle of the Plaza before the Moneta.
The signal would be to strike fire with flint and steel three
times, which was not too conspicuous and yet distinctive enough
for recognition.</p>

<p>"San Martin, the great Liberator, loved men of audacity and courage.
Besides, he was just and compassionate. I told him as much of
the man’s story as I knew, and was ordered to accompany him on
the appointed night. The signals were duly exchanged. It was midnight,
and the whole town was dark and silent. Their two cloaked figures
came together in the centre of the vast Plaza, and, keeping discreetly
at a distance, I listened for an hour or more to the murmur of
their voices. Then the general motioned me to approach; and as
I did so I heard San Martin, who was courteous to gentle and simple
alike, offer Gaspar Ruiz the hospitality of the headquarters for
the night. But the soldier refused, saying that he would not be
worthy of that honour till he had done something.</p>

<p>"‘You cannot have a common deserter for your guest, Excellency,’
he protested with a low laugh, and stepping backwards, merged
slowly into the night.</p>

<p>"The Commander-in-Chief observed to me, as we turned away: ‘He
had somebody with him, our friend Ruiz. I saw two figures for
a moment. It was an unobtrusive companion.’</p>

<p>"I too had observed another figure join the vanishing form of
Gaspar Ruiz. It had the appearance of a short fellow in a poncho
and a big hat. And I wondered stupidly who it could be he had
dared take into his confidence. I might have guessed it could
be no one but that fatal girl&mdash;alas!</p>

<p>"Where he kept her concealed I do not know. He had&mdash;it was known
afterwards&mdash;an uncle, his mother’s brother, a small shopkeeper
in Santiago. Perhaps it was there that she found a roof and food.
Whatever she found, it was poor enough to exasperate her pride
and keep up her anger and hate. It is certain she did not accompany
him on the feat he undertook to accomplish first of all. It was
nothing less than the destruction of a store of war material collected
secretly by the Spanish authorities in the south, in a town called
Linares. Gaspar Ruiz was entrusted with a small party only, but
they proved themselves worthy of San Martin’s confidence. The
season was not propitious. They had to swim swollen rivers. They
seemed, however, to have galloped night and day, outriding the
news of their foray, and holding straight for the town, a hundred
miles into the enemy’s country, till at break of day they rode
into it sword in hand, surprising the little garrison. It fled
without making a stand, leaving most of its officers in Gaspar
Ruiz’ hands.</p>

<p>"A great explosion of gunpowder ended the conflagration of the
magazines the raiders had set on fire without loss of time. In
less than six hours they were riding away at the same mad speed,
without the loss of a single man. Good as they were, such an exploit
is not performed without a still better leadership.</p>

<p>"I was dining at the headquarters when Gas-par Ruiz himself brought
the news of his success. And it was a great blow to the Royalist
troops. For a proof he displayed to us the garrison’s flag. He
took it from under his poncho and flung it on the table. The man
was transfigured; there was something exulting and menacing in
the expression of his face. He stood behind General San Martin’s
chair and looked proudly at us all. He had a round blue cap edged
with silver braid on his head, and we all could see a large white
scar on the nape of his sunburnt neck.</p>

<p>"Somebody asked him what he had done with the captured Spanish
officers.</p>

<p>"He shrugged his shoulders scornfully. ‘What a question to ask!
In a partisan war you do not burden yourself with prisoners. I
let them go&mdash;and here are their sword-knots.’</p>

<p>"He flung a bunch of them on the table upon the flag. Then General
Robles, whom I was attending there, spoke up in his loud, thick
voice: ‘You did! Then, my brave friend, you do not know yet how
a war like ours ought to be conducted. You should have done&mdash;this.’
And he passed the edge of his hand across his own throat.</p>

<p>"Alas, senores! It was only too true that on both sides this
contest, in its nature so heroic, was stained by ferocity. The
murmurs that arose at General Robles’ words were by no means unanimous
in tone. But the generous and brave San Martin praised the humane
action, and pointed out to Ruiz a place on his right hand. Then
rising with a full glass he proposed a toast: ‘Caballeros and
comrades-in-arms, let us drink the health of Captain Gaspar Ruiz.’
And when we had emptied our glasses: ‘I intend,’ the Commander-in-Chief
continued, ‘to entrust him with the guardianship of our southern
frontier, while we go afar to liberate our brethren in Peru. He
whom the enemy could not stop from striking a blow at his very
heart will know how to protect the peaceful populations we leave
behind us to pursue our sacred task.’ And he embraced the silent
Gaspar Ruiz by his side.</p>

<p>"Later on, when we all rose from table, I approached the latest
officer of the army with my congratulations. ‘And, Captain Ruiz,’
I added, ‘perhaps you do not mind telling a man who has always
believed in the uprightness of your character, what became of
Doña Erminia on that night?’</p>

<p>"At this friendly question his aspect changed. He looked at me
from under his eyebrows with the heavy, dull glance of a guasso&mdash;of
a peasant.</p>

<p>"Senor teniente,’ he said thickly, and as if very much cast down,
‘do not ask me about the senorita, for I prefer not to think about
her at all when I am amongst you.’</p>

<p>"He looked, with a frown, all about the room, full of smoking
and talking officers. Of course I did not insist.</p>

<p>"These, senores, were the last words I was to hear him utter
for a long, long time. The very next day we embarked for our arduous
expedition to Peru, and we only heard of Gaspar Ruiz’ doings in
the midst of battles of our own. He had been appointed military
guardian of our southern province. He raised a partida. But his
leniency to the conquered foe displeased the Civil Governor, who
was a formal, uneasy man, full of suspicions. He forwarded reports
against Gaspar Ruiz to the Supreme Government; one of them being
that he had married publicly, with great pomp, a woman of Royalist
tendencies. Quarrels were sure to arise between these two men
of very different character. At last the Civil Governor began
to complain of his inactivity, and to hint at treachery, which,
he wrote, would be not surprising in a man of such antecedents.
Gaspar Ruiz heard of it. His rage flamed up, and the woman ever
by his side knew how to feed it with perfidious words. I do not
know whether really the Supreme Government ever did&mdash;as he complained
afterwards&mdash;send orders for his arrest. It seems certain that
the Civil Governor began to tamper with his officers, and that
Gaspar Ruiz discovered the fact.</p>

<p>"One evening, when the Governor was giving a tertullia Gaspar
Ruiz, followed by six men he could trust, appeared riding through
the town to the door of the Government House, and entered the
sala armed, his hat on his head. As the Governor, displeased,
advanced to meet him, he seized the wretched man round the body,
carried him off from the midst of the appalled guests, as though
he were a child, and flung him down the outer steps into the street.
An angry hug from Gaspar Ruiz was enough to crush the life out
of a giant; but in addition Gaspar Ruiz’ horsemen fired their
pistols at the body of the Governor as it lay motionless at the
bottom of the stairs."</p>
