<p>The shot from the treacherous Indian upon the shore was the first
intelligent warning Tim had that he was discovered by them. The
kind Providence who had so often turned aside the dangerous missile
still protected him, and when he so suddenly dropped to the bottom
of his canoe, it was with a bullet-hole through his coat but not
through his body.</p>

<p>"Another illigant compliment to mesilf that it would afford me
great pleasure to return, and if you'll only be kind enough to
wait a few moments, I'll do the same."</p>

<p>But ere he could bring his gun to bear, the wild shot from the
island drove the savages to cover, and raised the Irishman's finger
that was pressing the trigger.</p>

<p>We have already told how, when he undertook to use the paddle,
he found it too dangerous, and coming again behind the deer, he
floated down the current. This, after the severe labor he had
undergone, was an agreeable change, but he was not long in discovering
it was dangerous. He was drifting away from his friends, and the
further he went the greater did the danger become to both parties.
He speedily discovered that the Indians were following him, and
the interposing body of the black-tailed deer was a most effectual
protection. More than his own bullets were buried in it ere he
had gone a half-mile down stream.</p>

<p>"If I entertained a small doubt that yez was killed, I couldn't
howld it with them bullets rattlin' in your hide, me owld friend."</p>

<p>The efforts of a child, if steadily persevered in, would move
the Great Eastern in calm water, and Tim was not long in making
the discovery that, if he could not use the paddle, he still was
able to exert a motive power upon the canoe by a very slight means.</p>

<p>Reaching his hand over the side, he began paddling the water,
and soon had the gratifying consciousness that he was moving across
the river. True, it was slow, but it was nevertheless certain
and positive, and was carrying him further away from his troublesome
pursuers, and must eventually bring him against the western shore.</p>

<p>But when the island disappeared from view, and he had barely
crossed the center of the stream, he begun to think that this
species of locomotion was rather tardy, and he partially came
to the sitting position and ventured to take his paddle in hand.
A discharge from the shore warned him of the danger he ran, and
he was reluctantly forced to drop his head again and resort to
his tedious method of moving.</p>

<p>By this time the afternoon was well advanced, and it looked as
though it would be fully dark before Tim could regain the ground
he had lost. Now and then he peered over the top of the deer to
see whether he could possibly catch sight of his acquaintances,
but they whisked from cover to cover so dexterously that he had
not the encouragement even to hope for success, and so he did
not fire.</p>

<p>But a new fear took possession of the fugitive. If they were
Indians, it was to be expected that they had canoes somewhere,
and if they were speedily found, he would as speedily be overhauled.</p>

<p>"In which case Tim O'Rooney will lose his daar, and be the same
towken lose himself, and the boys won't get their dinner."</p>

<p>He squinted at the sun, now low in the sky, and quickly asked
himself:</p>

<p>"If a man doesn't git his dinner, and ates half-way atween noon
and midnight, is it his dinner or supper? But that is a mighty
question, is the same."</p>

<p>He evidently concluded it was too vast for him to decide, for
he speedily dismissed it and turned his attention to that which
more nearly concerned him. Still toiling with his hand, much in
the same manner that a child would dabble in the water, he kept
up the tardy movement of the canoe until he began to grow fearless
again, and he took his paddle once more.</p>

<p>Now, when it was almost too late, he found that he could use
it without danger to himself. By bending his body forward, the
deer protected him and he could labor with impunity.</p>

<p>"Tim O'Rooney, I fears yez are lacking in the iliments which
go to make up a mon of sense. Why didn't yez think of this when
it would have done yez more good?"</p>

<p>When he was yet within a few yards of shore, he looked back and
was not a little frightened to see that the savages had launched
a canoe and were coming across the river with the speed of the
swallow.</p>

<p>"Whisht now! but that is onexpected," said he, as he redoubled
his own exertions. Observing that his pursuers were rapidly gaining,
he suddenly recalled an artifice that he had seen practiced during
his experience in the mines years before. Catching up his rifle,
he aimed it at the advancing Indians.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash they ducked their heads and held up the two
paddles they were using as a protection against the expected bullet.
But it was not Tim's purpose to fire. He knew better than to do
that, for ere he could have reloaded they would have been upon
him.</p>

<p>The minute they stooped he lowered his gun and caught up his
paddle and used it furiously. In this he was imitated by the Indians,
whose superior skill sent their frail vessel forward with such
velocity that it looked as if they would reach the shore but a
short distance behind him.</p>

<p>Again he raised his gun, and as before they attempted to screen
themselves from danger, while the next impulse of his paddle sent
his canoe high up the bank, and he sprung out and plunged into
the woods.</p>

<p>Tim O'Rooney had no thought of the particular manner in which
he was to effect his escape. His one desire was to get away from
them. The probabilities are that, beyond all doubt, he would have
been speedily overtaken and slain but for one of those singular
occurrences which do not happen to a man more than once in a life-time,
and which seem to show unmistakably that Providence often interferes
directly in favor of the innocent and distressed.</p>

<p>He had run perhaps a couple of hundred yards, or thereabouts,
when a peculiar whoop from his pursuers announced that they had
landed and were now coming speedily behind him. He knew that he
had no chance in running, and was looking about him for some place
in which to take shelter, when a furious growl startled him and
he found himself within a dozen feet from enormous grizzly bear.
This quadruped seemed anxious for a fight, for he came straight
at the fugitive, who might certainly be excused for being dazed
at the combination of dangers by which he was surrounded.</p>

<p>That of the grizzly bear was the greatest; for with mouth open
and his red tongue lolling out he came fiercely at him. His gait
was awkward and shambling, but he managed to get over the ground
very rapidly. Indeed, the danger was so imminent that Tim, seeing
there was no choice, raised his gun and fired at the monster.</p>

<p>The bullet struck him near the head, but it did not kill him,
nor did it cause him to fall, but it bewildered him, and he rose
on his hind feet and clawed the air as if the bullet was a splinter
and he was seeking to pluck it from his flesh.</p>

<p>This bewilderment was the means of Tim being saved. Before the
animal had entirely recovered, he had darted out of sight, and
when the Indians came up the bear was just in "fighting trim,"
and immediately made at them. Consequently they were compelled
to give over all thoughts of the flying hunter and attend to their
own personal safety. What the final result was Tim never learned,
and we cannot speak with certainty.</p>
