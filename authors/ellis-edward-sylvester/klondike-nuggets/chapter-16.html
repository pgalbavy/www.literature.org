<p>Not the least interesting feature of the stay of our friends
in the gold region was their dwelling during those memorable days.
The rocks came so nearly together that an irregular open space
was left, which averaged a width of twenty feet with a depth slightly
less. Thus three sides and the floor were composed of solid stone.
When the roof, as described, was put in place, the dwelling had
the appearance of a cavern fully open at the front. There the
canvas composing the tent was stretched, and so arranged that
the dwelling, as it may be called, was completed. It was inclosed
on all sides, with the door composed of the flaps of the tent,
which could be lowered at night, so that the inmates were effectually
protected against the weather, though had there been any prowling
wild animals or intruding white men near, they would have had
little difficulty in forcing an entrance. It has been explained
how all trouble from the smoke of a fire was avoided.</p>

<p>One of the peculiarities of this primitive house was its interior
arrangement. There were so many projecting points on the walls
that they were utilized as pegs upon which to hang the extra garments.
A ledge a couple of feet above the floor served as a couch, upon
which the boys spread their blankets, while the men laid theirs
on the floor itself. The mining and cooking utensils were neatly
arranged against the rear wall, where were piled the small canvas
bags intended to contain the gold dust and nuggets that were to
be gathered.</p>

<p>Jeff expressed the truth when he said:</p>

<p>"This will sarve us well while the weather is moderate; but if
we should be here when the thermometer goes down to fifty or sixty
degrees below zero, we'd turn into icicles before we could say
Jack Robinson."</p>

<p>Hardly pausing to place their house in order, the party set out
to investigate the find which Jeff hoped he had made.</p>

<p>Going up the stream for a short distance, they turned off into
a narrow valley, which never would have attracted the attention
of the boys.</p>

<p>The old miner stood for some minutes attentively studying his
surroundings, and then, instead of beginning to dig, as his companions
expected him to do, he said with an expression of disgust:</p>

<p>"Boys, I've made a mistake; there's no gold here."</p>

<p>"How can you tell until you search?" asked the astonished Roswell.</p>

<p>"It ain't what I thought it was; you don't find the stuff in
places like this. There's no use of wasting time; come on."</p>

<p>Wondering at his action, the three, smiling but silent, trailed
after him. Climbing over some intervening bowlders, they shortly
emerged into a place altogether different from any they had yet
seen. It was a valley two or three hundred feet in width, with
the sides gently sloping. There was no snow on the ground, and
here and there a few green blades of grass could be seen sprouting
from the fertile soil. Through the middle of this valley meandered
a stream eight or ten feet in width, but shallow, and so clear
that the bottom could be plainly seen while yet some distance
away. The valley itself soon curved out of sight above, and it
was impossible, therefore, to guess its extent in that direction.
Below it terminated, not far from where they stood, the rocks
coming together so as to form a small cañon, through which the
creek rushed with a velocity that reminded them of the dangerous
ones they had passed on their way from Chilkoot Pass.</p>

<p>"Wait here a bit," said Jeff, as he started toward the stream.
The others obeyed, watching his actions with interest.</p>

<p>He strode to the creek, along which he walked a few rods, his
head bent as he carefully scrutinized all that passed under his
eye. Suddenly he stopped and stared as if he had found that for
which he was looking. Then stooping down, he leaned as far out
as he could, gathered a handful of the gravelly soil, and put
it in the washer which he had taken with him. This was repeated
several times. Then he dipped the pan so as nearly to fill it
with water, after which he whirled it round several times with
a speed that caused some of the water to fly out. That part of
his work completed, he set down the pan which served as a washer,
and walked rapidly back toward his friends.</p>

<p>"Another disappointment," remarked Frank; "it isn't as easy to
find gold as we thought."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Tim McCabe. "Jiff looks to me
as if he has hit on something worth while. How is it, Jiff?" he
called as the old miner drew near.</p>

<p>"That's our claim," he replied; "we'll stake it out, and then
I'm going to Dawson to file it."</p>

<p>"Are you sure there is gold here?" asked Roswell, in some excitement.</p>

<p>"Yes, I hit it this time. We mustn't lose any days in staking
it out, or somebody else will get ahead of us."</p>

<p>The assurance of Jeff imparted confidence to the rest. The stakes
were cut and driven, according to the rule already stated, and
then Jeff breathed more freely.</p>

<p>"We've got sixty days to find the stuff," he said, "and nobody
daren't say a word to us. All the same, I'm going to Dawson to
file the claim and make things dead sure."</p>

<p>"When will you go?"</p>

<p>"Now, right off. I want to bring back some things with me, and
I'll be gone two or three days, but I won't lose no time."</p>

<p>Jeff was one of those men who do not require long to make up
their minds, and whom, having reached a decision, nothing can
turn aside from its execution. Ten minutes later he was hurrying
toward Dawson City, forty miles or more distant.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Tim McCabe had practical knowledge of placer mining,
the three decided to improve the time while Jeff was absent in
taking out some of the gold which he assured them was there.</p>

<p>As has been explained, this form of mining is of the crudest
and cheapest nature. In winter, after sinking a shaft to bed-rock,
tunnels are run in different directions, and the frozen dirt piled
up until warm weather permits its washing out. The distance to
bed-rock varies from four to twenty feet. The gold is found in
dust, grains, and nuggets, the last varying from the size of a
hickory-nut or larger to small grains of pure gold.</p>

<p>It quite often occurs that the bed-rock is seamy, with many small
depressions. It is supposed that when the <em>débris</em> containing
the original gold swept over this bed-rock, the great weight of
the metal caused it to fall and lodge in the crevices, where it
has lain for ages. Certain it is that the richest finds have been
made in such places.</p>

<p>Having fixed upon the spot where the work should begin, Tim McCabe
and the boys set to work to clear off the coarse gravel and stone
from a patch of ground. At the end of several hours they had completed
enough to begin operations. Tim dropped a few handfuls of the
finer gravel or sand into his pan, which was a broad, shallow
dish of sheet iron. Then water was dipped into the pan until it
was full, when he whirled it swiftly about and up and down. This
allowed the gold, on account of its greater specific gravity,
to fall to the bottom, while the sand itself was floated off by
the agitation. Tim had learned the knack of dipping the pan sideways,
so as gradually to get rid of the worthless stuff, while the heavy
yellow particles remained below.</p>

<p>The boys stood attentively watching the operation, which was
carried on with such skill that by and by nothing was left in
the bottom but the yellow and black particles. The latter were
pulverized magnetic iron ore, which almost always accompanies
the gold. Frank's and Roswell's eyes sparkled as they saw so much
of the yellow particles, even though it looked almost as fine
as the black sand.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE BOYS STOOD ATTENTIVELY WATCHING THE OPERATION</em>.]</p>

<p>"How will you separate them?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Now ye'll obsarve the use that that cask is to be put to," replied
Tim, "if ye'll oblige me by filling the same with water."</p>

<p>This was done, when Tim flung about a pound of mercury into the
cask, after which he dumped into it the black and yellow sand.
As soon as the gold came in contact with the mercury it formed
an amalgam.</p>

<p>"This will do to start things," said Tim. "When we have enough
to make it pay, we'll squaze it through a buckskin bag."</p>

<p>"What is the result?"</p>

<p>"Nearly all the mercury will ooze through the bag, and we can
use the same agin in the cask. The impure goold will be placed
on a shovel and held over a hot fire till the mercury has gone
off in vapor, and only the pure goold is lift, or rather there's
just a wee bit of the mercury still hanging 'bout the goold; but
we'll make a big improvement whin Jiff comes back. The filing
of this claim ain't the only thing that takes him to Dawson City."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the deposit here?"</p>

<p>"I b'lave it's one of the richest finds in the Kloondike counthry,
and if it turns out as it promises, we shall go home and live
like gintlemen the rist of our lives."</p>
