<p>IN the western part of Pennsylvania, near the commencement of
the Ohio river, stands a small town, which, at the close of the
last century, numbered about thirty dwellings. Although properly
a border settlement at the time mentioned, there were so many
others beyond, that it was hardly regarded as being in the "Mighty
West." The inhabitants were mostly farmers, possessed of large
and beautiful farms, who commenced their labors in the morning,
and retired to rest in the evening, without much fear of the molestation
of their savage brethren. True, a few years previous, the latter
had committed murders and depredations even farther east than
this, and the settlers never allowed themselves fully to give
way to an undue sense of security. But, unless a most unexpected
triumph should crown the struggles of the Indians, there was little
occasion for apprehension upon the part of the whites.</p>

<p>The time on which we visit this village, is an evening in the
spring, toward the close of the last century. The night is dark
and cloudy, and the houses are invisible in the deep gloom; but
there are numerous twinkling lights in the different dwellings,
which give it the appearance of a constellation set in the vast
sky of darkness around. Broad fields of cleared land stretch for
a long distance into the background, while there are numerous
other dwellings further eastward, toward Pittsburg, and many cabins
further westward in Ohio and Virginia; so that they are not without
neighbors, and may properly be said still to be in the land of
civilization.</p>

<p>Near the western end of the village, stood a large frame house,
in the lower story of which a bright light was burning. Within,
and seated around a large, crackling fire, were four individuals
engaged in conversation. The first was a pleasant, middle-aged
man, rather portly and good-natured; the second was his wife,
a few years younger, with an equally pleasant face, and a cheerful,
musical voice. Upon the opposite side of the fire sat a young
man, of a hardy, muscular frame, and a rather handsome appearance.
Beside him was a maiden of eighteen or twenty years, who, without
the least exaggeration on our part, might be pronounced beautiful.</p>

<p>The first couple, as said, were man and wife. The second two
intended to be at some future time&mdash;that is, they were lovers.</p>

<p>The name of the parents was Abbot, and the maiden was Marian
Abbot, their daughter. They were farmers, who, not having succeeded
as well as they anticipated, had come to the determination to
emigrate further west&mdash;in fact, into the very heart of Kentucky.
A flat-boat was to start the next morning down the river, in which
a number of their neighbors were going, and in which they intended
to send Marian; but, the parents themselves were compelled to
wait several months in order to bring their affairs to a settlement.
Their resolution had been taken rather suddenly, but, as said,
they were compelled to wait before fulfilling it.</p>

<p>The flat-boat which was to start on the morrow, carried with
it more men than Abbot expected would accompany him, and hence
he deemed it much safer for Marian that she should go with it,
and, in their western home, wait for his coming.</p>

<p>The young man to whom we have referred, was Russel Mansfield,
the only son of his parents, as was Marian the only daughter of
hers. An attachment had existed between them for a year or two,
and it was generally expected by the parents of both, that, as
soon as they were in a proper condition, they would be united
for life. The parents of Mansfield united with Abbot in their
resolution, and it was their intention to depart at the same time
with him. The same causes that led to his detention, produced
theirs; and, as it was their wish that Russel should remain with
and accompany them, he had consented. The young man disliked very
much the idea of a separation, even for so short a period as a
few months, from his beloved; but reflection and sober sense told
him it was best that it should be so. Nearly a dozen well-armed
and courageous men would protect her, while should her going be
deferred until his, there would hardly be half that number. Thus
it was that the present turn of affairs came about.</p>

<p>"If we have a storm at the commencement of our journey, it will
be a bad omen, will it not, father?" asked Marian with a smile.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, dear, don't speak of such foolish things. I would
that your mother had such a body-guard when she follows you."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I meant nothing. I am sure I have no apprehension."</p>

<p>"There is danger it is true," remarked Mansfield, "but it only
threatens weakness and inexperience. Your party are strong, and
they surely have had enough experience, to avoid all stratagems
and decoys of their enemy."</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, don't let such thoughts trouble you. There is
One who is able to protect the weakest in the hour of the greatest
peril. Dangers will beset you on every hand, but there will be
strong and friendly hearts around you, and a strong and friendly
Heart overhead," added the mother.</p>

<p>"There is but one thing that seriously troubles me," remarked
Abbot, gravely, "and that is the thought of that McGable. He has
now been absent a year, and you remember, Marian, that he threatened
vengeance against you when he left."</p>

<p>"Why, father, how can <em>he</em> injure me?" asked Marian in
surprise; "who knows where he has gone?"</p>

<p>"I have been told that he was in the West," answered Abbot, quietly.</p>

<p>"Well, and what of that? I am sure there is nothing in that,
that need frighten us."</p>

<p>"I have heard a darker story of him," added the father in a lower
tone, and glancing around as if he feared other ears might hear
him.</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Marian breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I have been told by those whose word could not be doubted, that
he has turned renegade, and that his atrocities are equal to those
of Girty, McGee, Proctor, and the other similar fiends."</p>

<p>"Where does he generally commit his outrages?" asked Mansfield.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to alarm you, Marian, and I think there is no
reason for your being alarmed; but, as all the others who will
accompany you, know the same thing, there can be no harm in warning
you. At first, when he joined the British and Indians, he united
with the parties who attacked the defenseless settlements and
travelers; but he is cowardly, and there was too much danger in
that. He is now a decoy along the Ohio river, and uses all the
means in his power to entice the passing flat-boats to shore.
The devil himself seems to aid his invention, for he has contrived
such ingenious schemes that it is said he has outwitted some of
the old backwoodsmen and hunters themselves."</p>

<p>"What does he do with his prisoners?"</p>

<p>"He has never been known to give quarter to any one. All are
consigned to the tomahawk or the stake, and the women perhaps
to a still more dreadful fate."</p>

<p>"What induced him to turn traitor?"</p>

<p>"His own devilish disposition, I suppose. He has more than once
given out that you will suffer, daughter, for your rejection of
him; and next to you his especial enmity seems to be against Mansfield
here."</p>

<p>"I only ask Heaven that we two may meet on equal ground. He would
never shame the race to which he belongs, again," exclaimed our
hero, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you may, Russel&mdash;perhaps you may. Ah! is that thunder?"</p>

<p>All listened for a moment, and heard the distant booming of thunder,
and the soughing of the wind through the trees that stood near
the house. A storm was, indeed, gathering. Dark, tumultuous clouds
were wheeling through the sky, and, as Mrs. Abbot looked out,
she could discern by the aid of the fire blazing on the broad
hearth, the tops of the trees swaying, and hear the night wind
howling through and around the village.</p>

<p>"There is a storm gathering, but I am in hopes that it will pass
off before morning," she remarked, as she resumed her knitting
and seat in the family rocking-chair.</p>

<p>"I guess it will not last long," added Mansfield.</p>

<p>Silence now reigned for a time in the house. Abbot sat in the
corner slowly smoking his pipe, and gazing meditatively in the
fire, watching the glowing embers as they fell apart, and conjuring
up pictures and images in the coals. The mother continued knitting,
her chair gently rocking, and giving out the same pleasant squeak
that it had for years. Now and then she raised her eyes for a
moment to glance at her husband or daughter, and then let them
fall again to the work before her. A kitten was tumbling over
the floor, playing antics with her ball of yarn, or whirling around
in a circle in an attempt to grasp the end of its tail. Failing
in this, it stood a moment, as if in meditation, and then with
a plunge, lit upon the back of a big maltese, quietly slumbering
at the feet of Marian, and fixed its claws in his head, eyes,
or any place that offered. The fellow bore it unflinchingly for
a moment, until becoming unendurable, he grasped the mischievous
creature by the head and holding it thus a moment, gave it several
digging kicks that sent it into the middle of the floor, and then
quietly resumed his half-sitting posture and shut his eyes again.</p>

<p>Upon the other side of the fire was stretched Hero, the house-dog.
He was of the hound species, and a noble fellow. As he lay, his
long nose was dropped upon the hearth, between his two paws, and
turned toward the fire. Probably he suspected mischief, for now
and then he slowly raised the corner of one eyelid, and glanced
at the kitten, and then with a twitch and start, slightly shifted
his position. Once or twice he flapped his long ears as if to
give warning that he was not yet asleep, and it would be dangerous
to trifle with him.</p>

<p>But the demon of mischief seemed to possess the young kitten.
It walked straight up to him, laid its paw on his cold nose, and
then scratched terribly. The dog in turn, raised one of his huge
paws, and gave it a cuff that rolled it to the middle of the floor
again. The kitten rose demurely and had recourse to the ball of
yarn once more. Hero seeing this, dropped his head with a threatening
look, and again slept.</p>

<p>The old clock ticked loudly upon the mantel, and the wind roared
down the chimney, and moaned around the house. Soon several drops
of rain rattled against the window, a terrific crash of thunder
burst overhead, and the storm came in all its fury.</p>

<p>It lasted but a short time when a lull occurred. Just at this
moment, the clock struck the hour of nine. Abbot knocked the ashes
from his pipe, took down the old, wooden-covered Bible, and commenced
reading a chapter. The mother laid aside her knitting, folded
her hands upon her lap, and Mansfield and Marian paid a respectful
attention.</p>

<p>The chapter finished, all sank devoutly upon their knees, and
the earnest monotone of Abbot ascended to the Protector of all.
The desolate moaning of the tempest, added solemnity to the scene,
and gave a beautiful appropriateness to the petition that was
offered.</p>

<p>As the parents arose, they bade Russel good night and retired.
Our hero left alone with Marian, glided to her side, took her
hand within his own and pulled her head over upon his bosom.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, Marian?"</p>

<p>"I was wondering at what father said."</p>

<p>"What? about McGable?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you alarmed?"</p>

<p>"I feel some apprehension, I confess. You know what a wicked
man he is, and what terrible passions he has. I know more of him
than you do, Russel."</p>

<p>"I suppose you do," he replied in a tone of slight reproof.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" she asked, looking up in his face
with a reproachful expression in her mild blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!" he laughed, kissing her glowing cheek.</p>

<p>"I mean I know more of him, Russel, because he has plagued me
more with his presence than he has you. I dreaded him as I did
a serpent, and when I, at last, told him I never wished to see
him again, he left me with a curse. O Russel! it was not me alone
that he cursed, but <em>you</em>! He swore that he would kill
you, for he knew you were the cause of it, and he said I should
suffer, too."</p>

<p>"You are not alarmed for me, Marian?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for I shall fear his power as long as he lives. I almost
wish that father would remain here, but there is no persuading
him, and I shall not falter at the last moment."</p>

<p>"I cannot share your apprehension. You are going to a settlement
which is well-guarded, and whose inhabitants are experienced in
Indian warfare. I can see no reason for fear."</p>

<p>"I trust there is not, but if I ever get there I shall look anxiously
for my parents and your arrival."</p>

<p>The two conversed longer upon the departure tomorrow, and discussed
their plans for the future, until, when the storm had ceased,
our hero took his departure.</p>

<p>As perhaps the reader has surmised, the person referred to by
the parents and the lovers, had once sought the hand of Marian.
He had made his appearance in the village a year or two previous,
and gave his name as Tom McGable. Further than this, nothing was
known. He professed to belong to the Eastern states, and had no
relations or acquaintances in the village. He was a thin, nervous,
sharp-featured man, with long Indian hair, dark, restless eyes,
and a forbidding cast of countenance. He was a person of awful
passions, and was dreaded by all who knew him. Marian turned from
his advances with loathing, but he pertinaciously persisted until
he was driven from her house. He left, vowing revenge; and rumor
shortly after reached the village that he had gone further west
and united with the Indians against the whites. There was good
reason for this report, as all knew that he was a man who would
stop at nothing that might gratify his vindictive feelings.</p>
