<p>John Estridge, out of a job&mdash;as were a million odd others now
arriving from France by every transport&mdash;met James Shotwell, Junior,
one wintry day as the latter was leaving the real estate offices
of Sharrow &amp; Co.</p>

<p>"The devil," exclaimed Estridge; "I supposed you, at least, were
safe in the service, Jim! Isn't your regiment in Germany?"</p>

<p>"It is," replied Shotwell wrathfully, shaking hands. "Where do
you come from, Jack?"</p>

<p>"From hell&mdash;via Copenhagen. In milder but misleading metaphor,
I come from Holy Russia."</p>

<p>"Did the Red Cross fire you?"</p>

<p>"No, but they told me to run along home like a good boy and get
my degree. I'm not an <em>M.D., </em>you know. And there's a shortage.
So I had to come."</p>

<p>"Same here; I had to come." And Shotwell, for Estridge's enlightenment,
held a post-mortem over the premature decease of his promising
military career.</p>

<p>"Too bad," commented the latter. "It sure was exciting while
it lasted&mdash;our mixing it in the great game. There's pandemonium
to pay in Russia, now; &mdash;I rather hated to leave.... But
it was either leave or be shot up. The Bolsheviki are impossible....
Are you walking up town?"</p>

<p>They fell into step together.</p>

<p>"You'll go back to the P. &amp; S., I suppose," ventured Shotwell.</p>

<p>"Yes. And you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm already nailed down to the old oaken desk. Sharrow's
my boss, if you remember?"</p>

<p>"It must seem dull," said Estridge sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Rotten dull."</p>

<p>"You don't mean business too, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's also on the bum.... I did contrive to sell a small
house the other day&mdash;and blew myself to this overcoat."</p>

<p>"Is that so unusual?" asked Estridge, smiling,"&mdash;to sell a house
in town?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a miracle in these days. Tell me, Jack, how did you
get on in Russia?"</p>

<p>"Too many Reds. We couldn't do much. They've got it in for everybody
except themselves."</p>

<p>"The socialists?"</p>

<p>"Not the social revolutionists. I'm talking about the Reds."</p>

<p>"Didn't they make the revolution?"</p>

<p>"They did not."</p>

<p>"Well, who are the Reds, and what is it they want?"</p>

<p>"They want to set the world on fire. Then they want to murder
and rob everybody with any education. Then they plan to start
things from the stone age again. They want loot and blood. That's
really all they want. Their object is to annihilate civilisation
by exterminating the civilised. They desire to start all over
from first principles&mdash;without possessing any&mdash;and turn the murderous
survivors of the human massacre into one vast, international pack
of wolves. And they're beginning to do it in Russia."</p>

<p>"A pleasant programme," remarked Shotwell. "No wonder you beat
it, Jack. I recently met a woman who had just arrived from Russia.
They murdered her best friend&mdash;one of the little Grand Duchesses.
She simply can't talk about it."</p>

<p>"That was a beastly business," nodded Estridge. "I happen to
know a little about it."</p>

<p>"Were <em>you</em> in that district?"</p>

<p>"Well, no,&mdash;not when that thing happened. But some little time
before the Bolsheviki murdered the Imperial family I had occasion
to escort an American girl to the convent where they were held
under detention.... An exceedingly pretty girl," he added absently.
"She was once companion to one of the murdered Imperial children."</p>

<p>Shotwell glanced up quickly: "Her name, by any chance, doesn't
happen to be Palla Dumont?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. Do you know her?"</p>

<p>"I sold her that house I was telling you about. Do you know her
well, Jack?"</p>

<p>Estridge smiled. "Yes and no. Perhaps I know her better than
she suspects."</p>

<p>Shotwell laughed, recollecting his friend's inclination for analysing
character and his belief in his ability to do so.</p>

<p>"Same old scientific vivisectionist!" he said. "So you've been
dissecting Palla Dumont, have you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. She's a type."</p>

<p>"A charming one," added Shotwell.</p>

<p>"Oh, very."</p>

<p>"But you don't know her well&mdash;outside of having mentally vivisected
her?"</p>

<p>Estridge laughed: "Palla Dumont and I have been through some
rather hair-raising scrapes together. And I'll admit right now
that she possesses all kinds of courage&mdash;perhaps too many kinds."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"She has the courage of her convictions and her convictions,
sometimes, don't amount to much."</p>

<p>"Go on and cut her up," said Shotwell, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"That's the only fault I find with Palla Dumont," explained the
other.</p>

<p>"I thought you said she was a type?"</p>

<p>"She is,&mdash;the type of unmarried woman who continually develops
too much pep for her brain to properly take care of."</p>

<p>"You mean you consider Palla Dumont neurotic?"</p>

<p>"No. Nothing abnormal. Perhaps super-normal&mdash;pathologically speaking.
Bodily health is fine. But over-secretion of ardent energy sometimes
disturbs one's mental equilibrium. The result, in a crisis, is
likely to result in extravagant behavior. Martyrs are made of
such stuff, for example."</p>

<p>"You think her a visionary?"</p>

<p>"Well, her reason and her emotions sometimes become rather badly
entangled, I fancy."</p>

<p>"Don't everybody's?"</p>

<p>"At intervals. Then the thing to do is to keep perfectly cool
till the fit is over."</p>

<p>"So you think her impulsive?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say so!" smiled Estridge. "Of course I mean nicely
impulsive&mdash;even nobly impulsive.... But that won't help her. Impulse
never helped anybody. It's a spoke in the wheel&mdash;a stumbling block&mdash;a
stick to trip anybody.... Particularly a girl.... And Palla Dumont
mistakes impulse for logic. She honestly thinks that she reasons."
He smiled to himself: "A disturbingly pretty girl," he murmured,
"with a tender heart ... which seems to do all her thinking for
her.... How well do you know her, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Not well. But I'm going to, I hope."</p>

<p>Estridge glanced up interrogatively, suddenly remembering all
the uncontradicted gossip concerning a tacit understanding between
Shotwell, Jr., and Elorn Sharrow. It is true that no engagement
had been announced; but none had been denied, either. And Miss
Sharrow had inherited her mother's fortune. And Shotwell, Jr.,
made only a young man's living.</p>

<p>"You ought to be rather careful with such a girl," he remarked
carelessly.</p>

<p>"How, careful?"</p>

<p>"Well, she's rather perilously attractive, isn't she?" insisted
Estridge smilingly.</p>

<p>"She's extremely interesting."</p>

<p>"She certainly is. She's rather an amazing girl in her way. More
amazing than perhaps you imagine."</p>

<p>"Amazing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, even astounding."</p>

<p>"For example?"</p>

<p>"I'll give you an example. When the Reds invaded that convent
and seized the Czarina and her children, Palla Dumont, then a
novice of six weeks, attempted martyrdom by pretending that she
herself was the little Grand Duchess Marie. And when the Reds
refused to believe her, she demanded the privilege of dying beside
her little friend. She even insulted the Reds, defied them, taunted
them until they swore to return and cut her throat as soon as
they finished with the Imperial family. And then this same Palla
Dumont, to whom you sold a house in New York the other day, flew
into an ungovernable passion; tried to batter her way into the
cellar; shattered half a dozen chapel chairs against the oak door
of the crypt behind which preparations for the assassination were
taking place; then, helpless, called on God to interfere and put
a stop to it. And, when deity, as usual, didn't interfere with
the scheme of things, this girl tore the white veil from her face
and the habit from her body and denounced as nonexistent any alleged
deity that permitted such things to be."</p>

<p>Shotwell gazed at Estridge in blank astonishment.</p>

<p>"Where on earth did you hear all that dope?" he demanded incredulously.</p>

<p>Estridge smiled: "It's all quite true, Jim. And Palla Dumont
escaped having her slender throat slit open only because a sotnia
of Kaladines' Cossacks cantered up, discovered what the Reds were
up to in the cellar, and beat it with Palla and another girl just
in the nick of time."</p>

<p>"Who handed you this cinema stuff?"</p>

<p>"<em>The other girl.</em>"</p>

<p>"You believe her?"</p>

<p>"You can judge for yourself. This other girl was a young Swedish
soldier who had served in the Battalion of Death. It's really
cinema stuff, as you say. But Russia, to-day, is just one hell
after another in an endless and bloody drama. Such picturesque
incidents,&mdash;the wildest episodes, the craziest coincidences&mdash;are
occurring by thousands every day of the year in Russia.... And,
Jim, it was due to one of those daily and crazy coincidences that
my sleigh, in which I was beating it for Helsingfors, was held
up by that same sotnia of the Wild Division on a bitter day, near
the borders of a pine forest.</p>

<p>"And that's where I encountered Palla Dumont again. And that's
where I heard&mdash;not from her, but from her soldier comrade, Ilse
Westgard&mdash;the story I have just told you."</p>

<p>For a while they continued to walk up and down in silence.</p>

<p>Finally Estridge said: "<em>There</em> was a girl for you!"</p>

<p>"Palla Dumont!" nodded Shotwell, still too astonished to talk.</p>

<p>"No, the other.... An amazing girl.... Nearly six feet; physically
perfect;&mdash;what the human girl ought to be and seldom is;&mdash;symmetrical,
flawless, healthy&mdash;a super-girl ... like some young daughter of
the northern gods!... Ilse Westgard."</p>

<p>"One of those women soldiers, you say?" inquired Shotwell, mildly
curious.</p>

<p>"Yes. There were all kinds of women in that Death Battalion.
We saw them,&mdash;your friend Palla Dumont and I,&mdash;saw them halted
and standing at ease in a birch wood; saw them marching into fire....
And there were all sorts of women, Jim; peasant, bourgeoise and
aristocrat;&mdash;there were dressmakers, telephone operators, servant-girls,
students, Red Cross nurses, actresses from the Marinsky, Jewesses
from the Pale, sisters of the Yellow Ticket, Japanese girls, Chinese,
Cossack, English, Finnish, French.... And they went over the top
cheering for Russia!... They went over to shame the army which
had begun to run from the hun.... Pretty fine, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Fine!"</p>

<p>"You bet!... After this war&mdash;after what women have done the world
over &mdash;I wonder whether there are any asses left who desire
to restrict woman to a 'sphere'?... I'd like to see Ilse Westgard
again," he added absently.</p>

<p>"Was she a peasant girl?"</p>

<p>"No. A daughter of well-to-do people. Quite the better sort,
I should say. And she was more thoroughly educated than the average
girl of our own sort.... A brave and cheerful soldier in the Battalion
of Death.... Ilse Westgard.... Amazing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>After another brief silence Shotwell ventured: "I suppose you'd
find it agreeable to meet Palla Dumont again, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course," replied the other pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Then, if you like, she'll ask us to tea some day&mdash;after her
new house is in shape."</p>

<p>"You seem to be very sure about what Palla Dumont is likely to
do," said Estridge, smiling.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I'm not!" retorted Shotwell, with emphasis. "Palla Dumont
has a mind of her own,&mdash;although you don't seem to think so,&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I think she has a <em>will</em> of her own," interrupted the
other, amused.</p>

<p>"Glad you concede her <em>some</em> mental attribute."</p>

<p>"I do indeed! I never intimated that she is weak-willed. She
isn't. Other and stronger wills don't dominate hers. Perhaps it
would be better if they did sometimes....</p>

<p>"But no; Palla Dumont arrives headlong at her own red-hot decisions.
It is not the will of others that influences her; it is their
indecision, their lack of willpower, their very weakness that
seems to stimulate and vitally influence such a character as Palla
Dumont's&mdash;"</p>

<p>" &mdash;Such a <em>character</em>?" repeated Shotwell. "What
sort of character do you suppose hers to be, anyway? Between you
and your psychological and pathological surmises you don't seem
to leave her any character at all."</p>

<p>"I'm telling you," said Estridge, "that the girl is influenced
not by the will or desire of others, but by their necessities,
their distress, their needs.... Or what she believes to be their
needs.... And you may decide for yourself how valuable are the
conclusions of an impulsive, wilful, fearless, generous girl whose
heart regulates her thinking apparatus."</p>

<p>"According to you, then, she is practically mindless," remarked
Shotwell, ironically. "You medically minded gentlemen are wonders!&mdash;all
of you."</p>

<p>"You don't get me. The girl is clever and intelligent when her
accumulated emotions let her brain alone. When they interfere,
her logic goes to smash and she does exaggerated things&mdash;like
trying to sacrifice herself for her friend in the convent there&mdash;like
tearing off the white garments of her novitiate and denouncing
deity!&mdash;like embracing an extravagant pantheistic religion of
her own manufacture and proclaiming that the Law of Love is the
only law!</p>

<p>"I've heard the young lady on the subject, Jim. And, medically
minded or not, I'm medically on to her."</p>

<p>They walked on together in silence for nearly a whole block;
then Estridge said bluntly:</p>

<p>"She'd be better balanced if she were married and had a few children.
Such types usually are."</p>

<p>Shotwell made no comment. Presently the other spoke again:</p>

<p>"The Law of Love! What rot! That's sheer hysteria. Follow that
law and you become a saint, perhaps, perhaps a devil. Love sacred,
love profane&mdash;both, when exaggerated, arise from the same physical
condition&mdash;too much pep for the mind to distribute.</p>

<p>"What happens? Exaggerations. Extravagances. Hallucinations.
Mysticisms.</p>

<p>"What results? Nuns. Hermits. Yogis. Exhorters. Fanatics. Cranks.
<em>Sometimes.</em> For, from the same chrysalis, Jim, may emerge
either a vestal, or one of those tragic characters who, swayed
by this same remarkable Law of Love, may give ... and burn on&mdash;slowly&mdash;from
the first lover to the next. And so, into darkness."</p>

<p>He added, smiling: "The only law of love subscribed to by sane
people is framed by a balanced brain and interpreted by common
sense. Those who obey any other code go a-glimmering, saint and
sinner, novice and Magdalene alike.... This is your street, I
believe."</p>

<p>They shook hands cordially.</p>

<p>After dining <em>en famille</em>, Shotwell Junior considered
the various diversions offered to young business men after a day
of labour.</p>

<p>There were theatres; there was the Club de Vingt and similar
agreeable asylums; there was also a telephone to ring, and unpremeditated
suggestions to make to friends, either masculine or feminine.</p>

<p>Or he could read and improve his mind. Or go to Carnegie Hall
with his father and mother and listen to music of sorts.... Or&mdash;he
could call up Elorn Sharrow.</p>

<p>He couldn't decide; and his parents presently derided him and
departed music-ward without him. He read an evening paper, discarded
it, poked the fire, stood before it, jingled a few coins and keys
in his pocket, still undecided, still rather disinclined to any
exertion, even as far as the club.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he thought, "what that girl is doing now. I've a
mind to call her up."</p>

<p>He seemed to know whom he meant by "that girl." Also, it was
evident that he did not mean Elorn Sharrow; for it was not her
number he called and presently got.</p>

<p>"Miss Dumont?"</p>

<p>"Yes? Who is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a mere nobody. It's only your broker&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>What!!</em>"</p>

<p>"Your real-estate broker&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Shotwell! How absurd of you!"</p>

<p>"Why absurd?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't think of you merely as a real-estate broker."</p>

<p>"Then you <em>do</em> sometimes think of me?"</p>

<p>"What power of deduction! What logic! You seem to be in a particularly
frivolous frame of mind. Are you?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm in a bad one."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I haven't a bally thing to do this evening."</p>

<p>"That's silly!&mdash;with the entire town outside.... I'm glad you
called me up, anyway. I'm tired and bored and exceedingly cross."</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Miss Dumont?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely and idiotically nothing. I'm merely sitting here
on the only chair in this scantily furnished house, and trying
to plan what sort of carpets, draperies and furniture to buy.
Can you imagine the scene?"</p>

<p>"I thought you had some things."</p>

<p>"I haven't anything! Not even a decent mirror. I stand on the
slippery edge of a bath tub to get a complete view of myself.
And then it's only by sections."</p>

<p>"That's tragic. Have you a cook?"</p>

<p>"I have. But no dining room table. I eat from a tray on a packing
case."</p>

<p>"Have you a waitress?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and a maid. They're comfortable. I bought their furniture
immediately and also the batterie-de-cuisine. It's only I who
slink about like a perplexed cat, from one empty room to another,
in search of familiar comforts.... But I bought a sofa to-day.</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful sofa. It's here, now. It's an antique. But
I can't make up my mind how to upholster it."</p>

<p>"Would you care for a suggestion?"</p>

<p>"Please!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'd have to see it&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I thought you'd say that. Really, Mr. Shotwell, I'd like most
awfully to see you, but this place is too uncomfortable. I told
you I'd ask you to tea some day."</p>

<p>"Won't you let me come down for a few moments this evening&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>" &mdash;And pay you a formal little call&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No.... Would you really like to?"</p>

<p>"I would."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't after you got here. There's nothing for you to
sit on."</p>

<p>"What about the floor?"</p>

<p>"It's dusty."</p>

<p>"What about that antique sofa?"</p>

<p>"It's not upholstered."</p>

<p>"What do I care! May I come?"</p>

<p>"Do you really wish to?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"How soon?"</p>

<p>"As fast as I can get there."</p>

<p>He heard her laughing. Then: "I'll be perfectly delighted to
see you," she said. "I was actually thinking of taking to my bed
out of sheer boredom. Are you coming in a taxi?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>He heard her laughing again.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she answered, "&mdash;only I thought that might be the
quickest way&mdash;" Her laughter interrupted her, "&mdash;to bring me the
evening papers. I haven't a thing to read."</p>

<p>"<em>That's</em> why you want me to take a taxi!"</p>

<p>"It is. News is a necessity to me, and I'm famishing.... What
other reason could there be for a taxi? Did you suppose I was
in a hurry to see you?"</p>

<p>He listened to her laughter for a moment:</p>

<p>"All right," he said, "I'll take a taxi and bring a book for
myself."</p>

<p>"And please don't forget my evening papers or I shall have to
requisition your book.... Or possibly share it with you on the
upholstered sofa.... And I read very rapidly and don't like being
kept waiting for slower people to turn the page.... Mr. Shotwell?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This is a wonderful floor. Could you bring some roller skates?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "but I'll bring a music box and we'll dance."</p>

<p>"You're not serious&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I am. Wait and see."</p>

<p>"Don't do such a thing. My servants would think me crazy. I'm
mortally afraid of them, too."</p>

<p>He found a toy-shop on Third Avenue still open, and purchased
a solemn little music-box that played ting-a-ling tunes.</p>

<p>Then, in his taxi, he veered over to Fifth Avenue and Forty-second
Street, where he bought roses and a spray of orchids. Then, adding
to his purchases a huge box of bon-bons, he set his course for
the three story and basement house which he had sold to Palla
Dumont.</p>
