Full half success for Fox or Man<br/>
Is won by working out a plan.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

</p>
</div>
<p>Granny Fox knows this. No one knows it better. Whatever she does
is first carefully planned in her wise old head. So now after
she had decided that she and Reddy would try for one of Farmer
Brown's fat hens, she lay down to think out a plan to get that
fat hen. No one knew better than she how foolish it would be to
go over to that henyard and just trust to luck for a chance to
catch one of those biddies. Of course, they might be lucky and
get a hen that way, but then again they might be unlucky and get
in a peck of trouble.</p>

<p>"You see," said she to Reddy, "we must not only plan how to get
that fat hen, but we must also plan how to get away with it safely.
If only there was some way of getting in that henhouse at night,
there would be no trouble at all. I don't suppose there is the
least chance of that."</p>

<p>"Not the least chance in the world," replied Reddy. "There isn't
a hole anywhere big enough for even Shadow the Weasel to get through,
and Farmer Brown's boy is very careful to lock the door every
night."</p>

<p>"There's a little hole that the hens go in and out of during
the day, which is big enough for one of us to slip through, I
believe," said Granny thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Sure! But it's always closed at night," snapped Reddy. "Besides,
to get to that or the door either, you have got to get inside
the henyard, and there's a gate to that which we can't open."</p>

<p>"People are sometimes careless,&mdash;even you, Reddy," said Granny.</p>

<p>Reddy squirmed uneasily, for he had been in trouble many times
through carelessness. "Well, what of it?" he demanded a wee bit
crossly.</p>

<p>"Nothing much, only if that hen-yard gate should happen to be
left open, and if Farmer Brown's boy should happen to forget to
close that little hole that the hens go through, and if we happened
to be around at just that time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too many ifs to get a dinner with," interrupted Reddy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied Granny mildly, "but I've noticed that it is
the one who has an eye open for all the little ifs in life that
fares the best. Now I've kept an eye on that henyard, and I've
noticed that very often Farmer Brown's boy doesn't close the henyard
gate at night. I suppose he thinks that if the henhouse door is
locked, the gate doesn't matter. Any one who is careless about
one thing, is likely to be careless about another. Sometime he
may forget to close that hole. I told you that we would try for
one of those hens to-morrow morning, but the more I think about
it, the more I think it will be wiser to visit that henhouse a
few nights before we run the risk of trying to catch a hen in
broad daylight. In fact, I am pretty sure I can make Farmer Brown's
boy forget to close that gate."</p>

<p>"How?" demanded Reddy eagerly.</p>

<p>Granny grinned. "I'll try it first and tell you afterwards,"
said she. "I believe Farmer Brown's boy closes the henhouse up
just before jolly, round, red Mr. Sun goes to bed behind the Purple
Hills, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>Reddy nodded. Many times from a safe hiding-place he had hungrily
watched Farmer Brown's boy shut the biddies up. It was always
just before the Black Shadows began to creep out from their hiding-places.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Granny. The truth is, she <em>KNEW </em>so.
There was nothing about that henhouse and what went on there that
Granny didn't know quite as well as Reddy. "You stay right here
this afternoon until I return. I'll see what I can do."</p>

<p>"Let me go along," begged Reddy.</p>

<p>"No," replied Granny in such a decided tone that Reddy knew it
would be of no use to tease. "Sometimes two can do what one cannot
do alone, and sometimes one can do what two might spoil. Now we
may as well take a nap until it is time for Mr. Sun to go to bed.
Just you leave it to your old Granny to take care of the first
of those ifs. For the other one we'll have to trust to luck, but
you know we are lucky sometimes."</p>

<p>With this Granny curled up for a nap, and having nothing better
to do, Reddy followed her example.</p>
