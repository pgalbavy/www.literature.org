<P>
Aynesworth was back in less than an hour. He carried under his arm a brown
paper parcel, the strings of which he commenced at once to untie. Wingrave,
who had been engrossed in the contents of his deed box, watched him with
immovable face.
<P>
"The tailor will be here at two-thirty," he announced, "and the other fellows
will follow on at half an hour's interval. The manicurist and the barber are
coming at six o'clock."
<P>
Wingrave nodded.
<P>
"What have you there?" he asked, pointing to the parcel.
<P>
"Cigars and cigarettes, and jolly good ones, too," Aynesworth answered,
opening a flat tin box, and smelling the contents appreciatively. "Try one of
these! The finest Turkish tobacco grown!"
<P>
"I don't smoke," Wingrave answered.
<P>
"Oh! You've got out of it, but you must pick it up again," Aynesworth
declared. "Best thing out for the nerves--sort of humanizes one, you know!"
<P>
"Humanizes one, does it?" Wingrave remarked softly. "Well, I'll try!"
<P>
He took a cigarette from the box, curtly inviting Aynesworth to do the same.
<P>
"What about lunch?" the latter asked. "Would you care to come round with me to
the Cannibal Club? Rather a Bohemian set, but there are always some good
fellows there."
<P>
"I am much obliged," Wingrave answered. "If you will ask me again in a few
days' time, I shall be very pleased. I do not wish to leave the hotel just at
present."
<P>
"Do you want me?" Aynesworth asked.
<P>
"Not until five o'clock," Wingrave answered. "I should be glad if you would
leave me now, and return at that hour. In the meantime, I have a commission
for you."
<P>
"Good!" Aynesworth declared. "What is it?"
<P>
"You will go," Wingrave directed, "to No. 13, Cadogan Street, and you will
enquire for Lady Ruth Barrington. If she should be out, ascertain the time of
her return, and wait for her."
<P>
"If she is out of town?"
<P>
"She is in London," Wingrave answered. "I have seen her from the window this
morning. You will give her a message. Say that you come from me, and that I
desire to see her tomorrow. The time and place she can fix, but I should
prefer not to go to her house."
<P>
Aynesworth stooped down to relight his cigarette. He felt that Wingrave was
watching him, and he wished to keep his face hidden.
<P>
"I am unknown to Lady Ruth," he remarked. "Supposing she should refuse to see
me?"
<P>
Wingrave looked at him coldly.
<P>
"I have told you what I wish done," he said. "The task does not seem to be a
difficult one. Please see to it that I have an answer by five o'clock-----"
<P>
Aynesworth lunched with a few of his particular friends at the club. They
heard of his new adventure with somewhat doubtful approbation.
<P>
"You'll never stand the routine, old chap!"
<P>
"And what about your own work!"
<P>
"What will the Daily Scribbler people say?"
<P>
Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"I don't imagine it will last very long," he answered, "and I shall get a fair
amount of time to myself. The work I do on the Daily Scribbler doesn't amount
to anything. It was a chance I simply couldn't refuse."
<P>
The editor of a well-known London paper leaned back in his chair, and pinched
a cigar carefully.
<P>
"You'll probably find the whole thing a sell," he remarked. "The story, as
Lovell told it, sounded dramatic enough, and if the man were to come back to
life again, fresh and vigorous, things might happen, provided, of course, that
Lovell was right in his suppositions. But ten or twelve years' solitary
confinement, although it mayn't sound much on paper, is enough to crush all
the life and energy out of a man."
<P>
Aynesworth shook his head.
<P>
"You haven't seen him," he said. "I have!"
<P>
"What's he like, Walter?" another man asked.
<P>
"I can't describe him," Aynesworth answered. "I shouldn't like to try. I'll
bring him here some day. You fellows shall see him for yourselves. I find him
interesting enough."
<P>
"The whole thing," the editor declared, "will fizzle out. You see if it
doesn't? A man who's just spent ten or twelve years in prison isn't likely to
run any risk of going there again. There will be no tragedy; more likely
reconciliation."
<P>
"Perhaps," Aynesworth said imperturbably. "But it wasn't only the possibility
of anything of that sort happening, you know, which attracted me. It was the
tragedy of the man himself, with his numbed, helpless life, set down here in
the midst of us, with a great, blank chasm between him and his past. What is
there left to drive the wheels? The events of one day are simple and
monotonous enough to us, because they lean up against the events of yesterday,
and the yesterdays before! How do they seem, I wonder, to a man whose
yesterday was more than a decade of years ago!"
<P>
The editor nodded.
<P>
"It must be a grim sensation," he admitted, "but I am afraid with you, my dear
Walter, it is an affair of shop. You wish to cull from your interesting
employer the material for that every-becoming novel of yours. Let's go
upstairs! I've time for one pool."
<P>
"I haven't," Aynesworth answered. "I've a commission to do."
<P>
He left the club and walked westwards, humming softly to himself, but thinking
all the time intently. His errand disturbed him. He was to be the means of
bringing together again these two people who had played the principal parts in
Lovell's drama--his new employer and the woman who had ruined his life. What
was the object of it? What manner of vengeance did he mean to deal out to her?
Lovell's words of premonition returned to him just then with curious
insistence--he was so certain that Wingrave's reappearance would lead to
tragical happenings. Aynesworth himself never doubted it. His brief interview
with the man into whose service he had almost forced himself had impressed him
wonderfully. Yet, what weapon was there, save the crude one of physical force,
with which Wingrave could strike?"
<P>
He rang the bell at No. 13, Cadogan Street, and sent in his card by the
footman. The man accepted it doubtfully.
<P>
"Her ladyship has only just got up from luncheon, sir, and she is not
receiving this afternoon," he announced.
<P>
Aynesworth took back his card, and scribbled upon it the name of the newspaper
for which he still occasionally worked.
<P>
"Her ladyship will perhaps see me," he said, handing the card back to the man.
"It is a matter of business. I will not detain her for more than a few
minutes."
<P>
The man returned presently, and ushered him into a small sitting room.
<P>
"Her ladyship will be quite half an hour before she can see you, sir," he
said.
<P>
"I will wait," Aynesworth answered, taking up a paper.
<P>
The time passed slowly. At last, the door was opened. A woman, in a plain but
exquisitely fitting black gown, entered. From Lovell's description, Aynesworth
recognized her at once, and yet, for a moment, he hesitated to believe that
this was the woman whom he had come to see. The years had indeed left her
untouched. Her figure was slight, almost girlish; her complexion as smooth,
and her coloring, faint though it was, as delicate and natural as a child's.
Her eyes were unusually large, and the lashes which shielded them heavy. It
was when she looked at him that Aynesworth began to understand.
<P>
She carried his card in her hand, and glanced at it as he bowed.
<P>
"You are the Daily Scribbler," she said. "You want me to tell you about my
bazaar, I suppose."
<P>
"I am attached to the Daily Scribbler, Lady Ruth Barrington," Aynesworth
answered; "but my business this afternoon has nothing to do with the paper. I
have called with a message from--an old friend of yours."
<P>
She raised her eyebrows ever so slightly. The graciousness of her manner was
perceptibly abated.
<P>
"Indeed! I scarcely understand you, Mr.--Aynesworth."
<P>
"My message," Aynesworth said, "is from Sir Wingrave Seton."
<P>
The look of enquiry, half impatient, half interrogative, faded slowly from her
face. She stood quite still; her impassive features seemed like a plaster
cast, from which all life and feeling were drawn out. Her eyes began slowly to
dilate, and she shivered as though with cold. Then the man who was watching
her and wondering, knew that this was fear--fear undiluted and naked.
<P>
He stepped forward, and placed a chair for her. She felt for the back of it
with trembling fingers and sat down.
<P>
"Is--Sir Wingrave Seton--out of prison?" she asked in a strange, dry tone. One
would have thought that she had been choking.
<P>
"Since yesterday," Aynesworth answered.
<P>
"But his time--is not up yet?"
<P>
"There is always a reduction," Aynesworth reminded her, "for what is called
good conduct."
<P>
She was silent for several moments. Then she raised her head. She was a brave
woman, and she was rapidly recovering her self-possession.
<P>
"Well," she asked, "what does he want?"
<P>
"To see you," Aynesworth answered, "tomorrow afternoon, either hee or at his
apartments in the Clarence Hotel. He would prefer not to come here!"
<P>
"Are you his friend?" she asked.
<P>
"I am his secretary," Aynesworth answered.
<P>
"You are in his confidence?"
<P>
"I only entered his service this morning," he said.
<P>
"How much do you know," she persisted, "of the unfortunate affair which
led--to his imprisonment?"
<P>
"I have been told the whole story," Aynesworth answered.
<P>
Her eyes rested thoughtfully upon his. It seemed as though she were trying to
read in his face exactly what he meant by "the whole story."
<P>
"Then," she said, "do you think that anything but pain and unpleasantness can
come of a meeting between us?"
<P>
"Lady Ruth," Aynesworth answered, "it is not for me to form an opinion. I am
Sir Wingrave Seton's secretary."
<P>
"What is he going to do?" she asked.
<P>
"I have no idea," he answered.
<P>
"Is he going abroad?"
<P>
"I know nothing of his plans," Aynesworth declared. "What answer shall I take
back to him?"
<P>
She looked at him earnestly. Gradually her face was softening. The frozen look
was passing away. The expression was coming back to her eyes. She leaned a
little towards him. Her voice, although it was raised above a whisper, was
full of feeling.
<P>
"Mr. Aynesworth," she murmured, "I am afraid of Sir Wingrave Seton!"
<P>
Aynesworth said nothing.
<P>
"I was always a little afraid of him," she continued, "even in the days when
we were friendly. He was so hard and unforgiving. I know he thinks that he has
a grievance against me. He will have been brooding about it all these years. I
dare not see him! I--I am terrified!"
<P>
"If that is your answer," Aynesworth said, "I will convey it to him!"
<P>
Her beautiful eyes were full of reproach.
<P>
"Mr. Aynesworth," she said, in a low tone, "for a young man you are very
unsympathetic."
<P>
"My position," Aynesworth answered, "does not allow me the luxury of
considering my personal feelings."
<P>
She looked hurt.
<P>
"I forgot," she said, looking for a moment upon the floor; "you have probably
been prejudiced against me. You have heard only one story. Listen"--she raised
her eyes suddenly, and leaned a little forward in her chair--"some day, if you
will come and see me when I am alone and we have time to spare, I will tell
you the whole truth. I will tell you exactly what happened! You shall judge
for yourself!"
<P>
Aynesworth bowed.
<P>
"In the meantime?"
<P>
Her eyes filled slowly with tears. Aynesworth looked away. He was miserably
uncomfortable.
<P>
"You cannot be quite so hard-hearted as you try to seem, Mr. Aynesworth," she
said quietly. "I want to ask you a question. You must answer it? You don't
know how much it means to me. You are Sir Wingrave Seton's secretary; you have
access to all his papers. Have you seen any letters of mine? Do you know if he
still has any in his possession?"
<P>
"My answer to both questions is 'No!'" Aynesworth said a little stiffly. "I
only entered the service of Sir Wingrave Seton this morning, and I know
nothing at all, as yet, of his private affairs. And, Lady Ruth, you must
forgive my reminding you that, in any case, I could not discuss such matters
with you," he added.
<P>
She looked at him with a faint, strange smile. Afterwards, when he tried to do
so, Aynesworth found it impossible to describe the expression which flitted
across her face. He only knew that it left him with the impression of having
received a challenge.
<P>
"Incorruptible!" she murmured. "Sir Wingrave Seton is indeed a fortunate man."
<P>
There was a lingering sweetness in her tone which still had a note of mockery
in it. Her silence left Aynesworth conscious of a vague sense of uneasiness.
He felt that her eyes were raised to his, and for some reason, which he could
not translate even into a definite thought, he wished to avoid them. The
silence was prolonged. For long afterwards he remembered those few minutes.
There was a sort of volcanic intensity in the atmosphere. He was acutely
conscious of small extraneous things, of the perfume of a great bowl of
hyacinths, the ticking of a tiny French clock, the restless drumming of her
finger tips upon the arm of her chair. All the time he seemed actually to feel
her eyes, commanding, impelling, beseeching him to turn round. He did so at
last, and looked her full in the face.
<P>
"Lady Ruth," he said, "will you favor me with an answer to my message?"
<P>
"Certainly," she answered, smiling quite naturally. "I will come and see Sir
Wingrave Seton at four o'clock tomorrow afternoon. You can tell him that I
think it rather an extraordinary request, but under the circumstances I will
do as he suggests. He is staying at the Clarence, I presume, under his own
name? I shall have no difficulty in finding him?"
<P>
"He is staying there under his own name," Aynesworth answered, "and I will see
that you have no difficulty."
<P>
"So kind of you," she murmured, holding out her hand. And again there was
something mysterious in her eyes as she raised them to him, as though there
existed between them already some understanding which mocked the
conventionality of her words. Aynesworth left the house, and lit a cigarette
upon the pavement outside with a little sigh of relief. He felt somehow
humiliated. Did she fancy, he wondered, that he was a callow boy to dance to
any tune of her piping--that he had never before seen a beautiful woman who
wanted her own way?
