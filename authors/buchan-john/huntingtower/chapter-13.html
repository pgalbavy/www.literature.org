<p>Mr. John Heritage, solitary in the old Tower, found much to occupy
his mind. His giddiness was passing, though the dregs of a headache
remained, and his spirits rose with his responsibilities. At daybreak
he breakfasted out of the Mearns Street provision box, and made
tea in one of the Die-Hards' camp kettles. Next he gave some attention
to his toilet, necessary after the rough-and-tumble of the night.
He made shift to bathe in icy water from the Tower well, shaved,
tidied up his clothes and found a clean shirt from his pack. He
carefully brushed his hair, reminding himself that thus had the
Spartans done before Thermopylæ. The neat and somewhat pallid
young man that emerged from these rites then ascended to the first
floor to reconnoitre the landscape from the narrow unglazed windows.</p>

<p>If any one had told him a week ago that he would be in so strange
a world he would have quarrelled violently with his informant.
A week ago he was a cynical clear-sighted modern, a contemner
of illusions, a swallower of formulas, a breaker of shams&mdash;one
who had seen through the heroical and found it silly. Romance
and such-like toys were playthings for fatted middle-age, not
for strenuous and cold-eyed youth. But the truth was that now
he was altogether spellbound by these toys. To think that he was
serving his lady was rapture&mdash;ecstasy, that for her he was single-handed
venturing all. He rejoiced to be alone with his private fancies.
His one fear was that the part he had cast himself for should
be needless, that the men from the sea should not come, or that
reinforcements would arrive before he should be called upon. He
hoped alone to make a stand against thousands. What the upshot
might be he did not trouble to inquire. Of course the Princess
would be saved, but first he must glut his appetite for the heroic.</p>

<p>He made a diary of events that day, just as he used to do at
the front. At twenty minutes past eight he saw the first figure
coming from the House. It was Spidel, who limped round the Tower,
tried the door, and came to a halt below the window. Heritage
stuck out his head and wished him good morning, getting in reply
an amazed stare. The man was not disposed to talk, though Heritage
made some interesting observations on the weather, but departed
quicker than he came, in the direction of the West Lodge.</p>

<p>Just before nine o'clock he returned with Dobson and Léon. They
made a very complete reconnaissance of the Tower, and for a moment
Heritage thought that they were about to try to force an entrance.
They tugged and hammered at the great oak door, which he had further
strengthened by erecting behind it a pile of the heaviest lumber
he could find in the place. It was imperative that they should
not get in, and he got Dickson's pistol ready with the firm intention
of shooting them if necessary. But they did nothing, except to
hold a conference in the hazel clump a hundred yards to the north,
when Dobson seemed to be laying down the law, and Léon spoke rapidly
with a great fluttering of hands. They were obviously puzzled
by the sight of Heritage, whom they believed to have left the
neighbourhood. Then Dobson went off, leaving Léon and Spidel on
guard, one at the edge of the shrubberies between the Tower and
the House, the other on the side nearest the Laver glen. These
were their posts, but they did sentry-go around the building,
and passed so close to Heritage's window that he could have tossed
a cigarette on their heads.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that he ought to get busy with camouflage.
They must be convinced that the Princess was in the place, for
he wanted their whole mind to be devoted to the siege. He rummaged
among the ladies' baggage, and extracted a skirt and a coloured
scarf. The latter he managed to flutter so that it could be seen
at the window the next time one of the watchers came within sight.
He also fixed up the skirt so that the fringe of it could be seen,
and, when Léon appeared below, he was in the shadow talking rapid
French in a very fair imitation of the tones of Cousin Eugènie.
The ruse had its effect, for Léon promptly went off to tell Spidel,
and when Dobson appeared he too was given the news. This seemed
to settle their plans, for all three remained on guard, Dobson
nearest to the Tower, seated on an outcrop of rock with his mackintosh
collar turned up, and his eyes usually turned to the misty sea.</p>

<p>By this time it was eleven o'clock, and the next three hours
passed slowly with Heritage. He fell to picturing the fortunes
of his friends. Dickson and the Princess should by this time be
far inland, out of danger and in the way of finding succour. He
was confident that they would return, but he trusted not too soon,
for he hoped for a run for his money as Horatius in the Gate.
After that he was a little torn in his mind. He wanted the Princess
to come back and to be somewhere near if there was a fight going,
so that she might be a witness of his devotion. But she must not
herself run any risk, and he became anxious when he remembered
her terrible sangfroid. Dickson could no more restrain her than
a child could hold a greyhound.... But of course it would never
come to that. The police would turn up long before the brig appeared
&mdash;Dougal had thought that would not be till high tide, between
four and five&mdash;and the only danger would be to the pirates. The
three watchers would be put in the bag, and the men from the sea
would walk into a neat trap. This reflection seemed to take all
the colour out of Heritage's prospect. Peril and heroism were
not to be his lot&mdash;only boredom.</p>

<p>A little after twelve two of the tinklers appeared with some
news which made Dobson laugh and pat them on the shoulder. He
seemed to be giving them directions, pointing seaward and southward.
He nodded to the Tower, where Heritage took the opportunity of
again fluttering Saskia's scarf athwart the window. The tinklers
departed at a trot, and Dobson lit his pipe as if well pleased.
He had some trouble with it in the wind, which had risen to an
uncanny violence. Even the solid Tower rocked with it, and the
sea was a waste of spindrift and low scurrying cloud. Heritage
discovered a new anxiety&mdash;this time about the possibility of the
brig landing at all. He wanted a complete bag, and it would be
tragic if they got only the three seedy ruffians now circumambulating
his fortress.</p>

<p>About one o'clock he was greatly cheered by the sight of Dougal.
At the moment Dobson was lunching off a hunk of bread and cheese
directly between the Tower and the House, just short of the crest
of the ridge on the other side of which lay the stables and the
shrubberies; Léon was on the north side opposite the Tower door,
and Spidel was at the south end near the edge of the Garple glen.
Heritage, watching the ridge behind Dobson and the upper windows
of the House which appeared over it, saw on the very crest something
like a tuft of rusty bracken which he had not noticed before.
Presently the tuft moved, and a hand shot up from it waving a
rag of some sort. Dobson at the moment was engaged with a bottle
of porter, and Heritage could safely wave a hand in reply. He
could now make out clearly the red head of Dougal.</p>

<p>The Chieftain, having located the three watchers, proceeded to
give an exhibition of his prowess for the benefit of the lonely
inmate of the Tower. Using as cover a drift of bracken, he wormed
his way down till he was not six yards from Dobson, and Heritage
had the privilege of seeing his grinning countenance a very little
way above the innkeeper's head. Then he crawled back and reached
the neighbourhood of Léon, who was sitting on a fallen Scotch
fir. At that moment it occurred to the Belgian to visit Dobson.
Heritage's breath stopped, but Dougal was ready, and froze into
a motionless blur in the shadow of a hazel bush. Then he crawled
very fast into the hollow where Léon had been sitting, seized
something which looked like a bottle, and scrambled back to the
ridge. At the top he waved the object, whatever it was, but Heritage
could not reply, for Dobson happened to be looking towards the
window. That was the last he saw of the Chieftain, but presently
he realised what was the booty he had annexed. It must be Léon's
life-preserver, which the night before had broken Heritage's head.</p>

<p>After that cheering episode boredom again set in. He collected
some food from the Mearns Street box, and indulged himself with
a glass of liqueur brandy. He was beginning to feel miserably
cold, so he carried up some broken wood and made a fire on the
immense hearth in the upper chamber. Anxiety was clouding his
mind again, for it was now two o'clock, and there was no sign
of the reinforcements which Dickson and the Princess had gone
to find. The minutes passed, and soon it was three o'clock, and
from the window he saw only the top of the gaunt shuttered House,
now and then hidden by squalls of sleet, and Dobson squatted like
an Eskimo, and trees dancing like a witch-wood in the gale. All
the vigour of the morning seemed to have gone out of his blood;
he felt lonely and apprehensive and puzzled. He wished he had
Dickson beside him, for that little man's cheerful voice and complacent
triviality would be a comfort.... Also, he was abominably cold.
He put on his waterproof, and turned his attention to the fire.
It needed re-kindling, and he hunted in his pockets for paper,
finding only the slim volume lettered <em>Whorls</em>.</p>

<p>I set it down as the most significant commentary on his state
of mind. He regarded the book with intense disfavour, tore it
in two, and used a handful of its fine deckle-edged leaves to
get the fire going. They burned well, and presently the rest followed.
Well for Dickson's peace of mind that he was not a witness of
such vandalism.</p>

<p>A little warmer but in no way more cheerful, he resumed his watch
near the window. The day was getting darker, and promised an early
dusk. His watch told him that it was after four, and still nothing
had happened. Where on earth were Dickson and the Princess? Where
in the name of all that was holy were the police? Any minute now
the brig might arrive and land its men, and he would be left there
as a burnt-offering to their wrath. There must have been an infernal
muddle somewhere.... Anyhow the Princess was out of the trouble,
but where the Lord alone knew.... Perhaps the reinforcements were
lying in wait for the boats at the Garplefoot. That struck him
as a likely explanation, and comforted him. Very soon he might
hear the sound of an engagement to the south, and the next thing
would be Dobson and his crew in flight. He was determined to be
in the show somehow and would be very close on their heels. He
felt a peculiar dislike to all three, but especially to Léon.
The Belgian's small baby features had for four days set him clenching
his fists when he thought of them.</p>

<p>The next thing he saw was one of the tinklers running hard towards
the Tower. He cried something to Dobson, which Heritage could
not catch, but which woke the latter to activity. The innkeeper
shouted to Léon and Spidel, and the tinkler was excitedly questioned.
Dobson laughed and slapped his thigh. He gave orders to the others,
and himself joined the tinkler and hurried off in the direction
of the Garplefoot. Something was happening there, something of
ill omen, for the man's face and manner had been triumphant. Were
the boats landing?</p>

<p>As Heritage puzzled over this event, another figure appeared
on the scene. It was a big man in knickerbockers and mackintosh,
who came round the end of the House from the direction of the
South Lodge. At first he thought it was the advance-guard from
his own side, the help which Dickson had gone to find, and he
only restrained himself in time from shouting a welcome. But surely
their supports would not advance so confidently in enemy country.
The man strode over the slopes as if looking for somebody; then
he caught sight of Léon and waved him to come. Léon must have
known him, for he hastened to obey.</p>

<p>The two were about thirty yards from Heritage's window. Léon
was telling some story volubly, pointing now to the Tower and
now towards the sea. The big man nodded as if satisfied. Heritage
noted that his right arm was tied up, and that the mackintosh
sleeve was empty, and that brought him enlightenment. It was Loudon
the factor, whom Dickson had winged the night before. The two
of them passed out of view in the direction of Spidel.</p>

<p>The sight awoke Heritage to the supreme unpleasantness of his
position. He was utterly alone on the headland, and his allies
had vanished into space, while the enemy plans, moving like clock-work,
were approaching their consummation. For a second he thought of
leaving the Tower and hiding somewhere in the cliffs. He dismissed
the notion unwillingly, for he remembered the task that had been
set him. He was there to hold the fort to the last&mdash;to gain time,
though he could not for the life of him see what use time was
to be when all the strategy of his own side seemed to have miscarried.
Anyhow, the blackguards would be sold for they would not find
the Princess. But he felt a horrid void in the pit of his stomach,
and a looseness about his knees.</p>

<p>The moments passed more quickly as he wrestled with his fears.
The next he knew the empty space below his window was filling
with figures. There was a great crowd of them, rough fellows with
seamen's coats, still dripping as if they had had a wet landing.
Dobson was with them, but for the rest they were strange figures.</p>

<p>Now that the expected had come at last Heritage's nerves grew
calmer. He made out that the newcomers were trying the door, and
he waited to hear it fall, for such a mob could soon force it.
But instead a voice called from beneath.</p>

<p>"Will you please open to us?" it said.</p>

<p>He stuck his head out and saw a little group with one man at
the head of it, a young man clad in oilskins whose face was dim
in the murky evening. The voice was that of a gentleman.</p>

<p>"I have orders to open to no one," Heritage replied.</p>

<p>"Then I fear we must force an entrance," said the voice.</p>

<p>"You can go to the devil," said Heritage.</p>

<p>That defiance was the screw which his nerves needed. His temper
had risen, he had forgotten all about the Princess, he did not
even remember his isolation. His job was to make a fight for it.
He ran up the staircase which led to the attics of the Tower,
for he recollected that there was a window there which looked
over the ground before the door. The place was ruinous, the floor
filled with holes, and a part of the roof sagged down in a corner.
The stones around the window were loose and crumbling and he managed
to pull several out so that the slit was enlarged. He found himself
looking down on a crowd of men, who had lifted the fallen tree
on which Léon had perched, and were about to use it as a battering
ram.</p>

<p>"The first fellow who comes within six yards of the door I shoot,"
he shouted.</p>

<p>There was a white wave below as every face was turned to him.
He ducked back his head in time as a bullet chipped the side of
the window.</p>

<p>But his position was a good one, for he had a hole in the broken
wall through which he could see, and could shoot with his hand
at the edge of the window while keeping his body in cover. The
battering party resumed their task, and as the tree swung nearer,
he fired at the foremost of them. He missed, but the shot for
a moment suspended operations.</p>

<p>Again they came on, and again he fired. This time he damaged
somebody, for the trunk was dropped.</p>

<p>A voice gave orders, a sharp authoritative voice. The battering
squad dissolved, and there was a general withdrawal out of the
line of fire from the window. Was it possible that he had intimidated
them? He could hear the sound of voices, and then a single figure
came into sight again, holding something in its hand.</p>

<p>He did not fire, for he recognised the futility of his efforts.
The baseball swing of the figure below could not be mistaken.
There was a roar beneath, and a flash of fire, as the bomb exploded
on the door. Then came a rush of men, and the Tower had fallen.</p>

<p>Heritage clambered through a hole in the roof and gained the
topmost parapet. He had still a pocketful of cartridges, and there
in a coign of the old battlements he would prove an ugly customer
to the pursuit. Only one at a time could reach that siege perilous....
They would not take long to search the lower rooms, and then would
be hot on the trail of the man who had fooled them. He had not
a scrap of fear left or even of anger&mdash;only triumph at the thought
of how properly those ruffians had been sold. "Like schoolboys
they who unaware"&mdash;instead of two women they had found a man with
a gun. And the Princess was miles off and forever beyond their
reach. When they had settled with him they would no doubt burn
the House down, but that would serve them little. From his airy
pinnacle he could see the whole sea-front of Huntingtower, a blur
in the dusk but for the ghostly eyes of its white-shuttered windows.</p>

<p>Something was coming from it, running lightly over the lawns,
lost for an instant in the trees, and then appearing clear on
the crest of the ridge where some hours earlier Dougal had lain.
With horror he saw that it was a girl. She stood with the wind
plucking at her skirts and hair, and she cried in a high, clear
voice which pierced even the confusion of the gale. What she cried
he could not tell for it was in a strange tongue....</p>

<p>But it reached the besiegers. There was a sudden silence in the
din below him and then a confusion of shouting. The men seemed
to be pouring out of the gap which had been the doorway, and as
he peered over the parapet first one and then another entered
his area of vision. The girl on the ridge, as soon as she saw
that she had attracted attention, turned and ran back, and after
her up the slopes went the pursuit bunched like hounds on a good
scent.</p>

<p>Mr. John Heritage, swearing terribly, started to retrace his
steps.</p>
