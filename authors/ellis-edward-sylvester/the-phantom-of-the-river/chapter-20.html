<p>Even after considerable more conversation than has been recorded,
Jethro Juggens and the missionary had much to learn of each other.</p>

<p>The youth was especially puzzled to understand how it was that
almost immediately following the flight of the Shawanoe in the
extremity of panic, the good man should have paddled out to the
flatboat in the canoe that had been so hurriedly deserted.</p>

<p>"That was a curious circumstance," said Mr. Finley, musingly;
"sit down beside me and I will tell you about it."</p>

<p>"I's bery glad to do so," replied Jethro, placing himself at
a respectful distance from the good man, "if you don't tink I
had better keep a lookout dat we don't run by the block-house
afore we knows it."</p>

<p>"My dear boy, we are still a long way from that. Have no fear.
From what you have told me I see you understand that sad times
are coming between the white people and the Indians of this region."</p>

<p>"Yes, sah."</p>

<p>"I and many of my friends have been expecting it for weeks and
months past, and have done all we could to prevent the dreadful
state of things that is now at hand."</p>

<p>"How was it you tried to prevent it?" asked Jethro, feeling that
he ought to say something when the missionary paused; "was yo'
idee to get all de Injuns togeder, tie' em fast to de trees, and
den let the trees fall down on 'em and mash 'em?"</p>

<p>"No, we had a better plan than that," gravely replied the missionary,
making sure the youth did not see the flitting smile; "I went
among the different tribes and talked with the chiefs and leaders,
and strove in every way possible to show them not only the wickedness
of going upon the war-path, but that in the end they themselves
must be the chief sufferers."</p>

<p>Jethro Juggens turned his head and stared at the speaker in amazement.</p>

<p>"And did yo' go right 'mong de heathen all alone by yo'self?"</p>

<p>"That's the only way in which I could have gone. They would not
have allowed me to have any companions, for that would have shown
I distrusted them."</p>

<p>"Wal, didn't yo' obstrust them?" inquired the youth, to whom
the whole business was a mystery.</p>

<p>"I cannot deny that I felt I was in danger of violence at times,
but when I took up the work of my Master I expected that, and
therefore was not disappointed. If it was the will of Heaven that
I should yield my life at any time, I was always ready. You know,
my son, that that is the true way to live."</p>

<p>"Yes, sah."</p>

<p>"So it never caused me any discomfort. The only uneasiness a
person should feel is whether he is ready for the call when it
comes. Well, to return to what you asked me about, it soon became
clear to me that the worst sort of trouble was at hand. The Indians
have defeated the expeditions sent against them, until many believe
our government is not strong enough to conquer them. They need
a crushing defeat, just such as I am sure the next battle will
be, before we can secure a lasting peace for the frontier. I was
engaged in this business when I approached the Ohio this evening.
At the moment of reaching the river I caught sight of this boat
and the ingenious arrangement you have made. I saw the terrified
Indian whom you hailed dash to shore and flee in mortal fright
into the woods.</p>

<p>"There was not enough light for me to recognize him," continued
the missionary, speaking as though every person, American and
Caucasian, in that vast region was an acquaintance. "I called
to him, but he paid no heed, and inasmuch as he had left his canoe
behind him and I wished to cross the river, I thought I might
as well call upon you."</p>

<p>"What yo' want to cross de riber fur?" asked Jethro, without
reflecting that his question approached impertinence.</p>

<p>"Just now, I am looking for a chief known as Wa-on-mon, or, as
his own people call him, The Panther."</p>

<p>"Do yo' know dat debbil?" demanded the amazed youth, springing
to his feet and looking down in the face of the surprised missionary,
who replied:</p>

<p>"I have known him a good many years, have slept in his lodge,
have fondled his two children, have hunted with him, and placed
my life in his hands times without number."</p>

<p>Jethro could hardly express his astonishment at this information.
Aside from what he had seen of the fierce chieftain, he could
not forget the character given him by Simon Kenton. In his way,
he related the proposed duel to the death between the ranger and
the leader of the Shawanoes.</p>

<p>Mr. Finley listened with the deepest interest, for he felt a
strong attachment to both of the parties, and he cherished the
hope that the fearful personal encounters between them would give
way, sooner or later, to a more charitable, if not to a gentler
feeling.</p>

<p>"De reason de fout didn't take place," explained Jethro, "was
'cause de Panther got scared and runned away."</p>

<p>The reply was, in effect, that which was made by Daniel Boone
when discussing the question with Kenton.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken in supposing Wa-on-mon was frightened; he is
afraid of no man."</p>

<p>"What den made him get skeered at Mr. Kenton?"</p>

<p>"He did not. The Panther's heart is full of bitterness toward
the white people. He saw, by hurrying off, a chance to do greater
harm to those whom he regards as intruders upon the hunting grounds
of his people; that is why the two did not meet."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kenton says de Panther hab shot women and children, and
done de wust tings dat you can tink of."</p>

<p>"Simon Kenton is a truthful man."</p>

<p>"And I know he hab tried to do a worser ting dan dat."</p>

<p>"Impossible! What can it be?"</p>

<p>"He tried to step into my mouf when I war asleep."</p>

<p>The brave old pioneer preachers were as full of humor as they
were of tenderness or pathos. Mr. Finley threw back his head and
shook with laughter, though it was noticeable that it was as silent
as that of Leatherstocking when that inimitable hero was amused
with anything that took place in the woods.</p>

<p>The missionary made the youth give him the particulars of the
incident, and despite the tragic atmosphere by which it was surrounded,
he appreciated its grotesque features. Before he had grasped the
whole occurrence he shuddered at the tempest of fury that he knew
had been awakened to life in the breast of the terrible chieftain
of the Shawanoes.</p>

<p>"To think of his being flung to the ground by this young man,
of his being struck by him, and then bound and held for hours
in captivity&mdash;ah, me! I pray that this colored youth may never
fall into the power of Wa-on-mon. Much I fear that yesterday's
events have so deepened the hatred of the chieftain, that the
truth can make little impression upon his heart."</p>

<p>By questioning and comment, Mr. Finley gradually gained an accurate
idea of the perilous situation of the pioneers who were on their
way to the block-house to escape the storm that was already bursting
from the sky. The information, however, that he filtered through
the brain of Jethro Juggens could not fail to be mystifying in
more than one respect.</p>

<p>Thus he knew that the pioneers had started up the Kentucky side
of the river for Capt. Bushwick's block-house, and, before going
far, had come to a halt, while Kenton returned to the clearing
in quest of the canoe that had been left there beside the flatboat.
His natural object, it would seem, in taking this course, was
to secure the smaller craft for use in transporting the women
and children to the other side of the Ohio. Why he should have
taken Jethro Juggens as a companion could not be conjectured.</p>

<p>Another self-evident fact caused the missionary less misgiving
than would be supposed. Kenton had captured the canoe, for he
and it were gone when the youth boarded the flatboat. Furthermore,
the craft in which the visitor paddled out to the flatboat was
the very one, as identified by Jethro, which, in some way, had
been recaptured from the ranger. The presence of the warrior in
the boat seemed to point with absolute certainty to the conclusion
that the Shawanoe had slain the great pioneer before wresting
the property from him.</p>

<p>But Mr. Finley did not accept that theory, and was willing to
await an explanation in the near future.</p>

<p>An inexpressibly greater and more distressing problem lay beyond
that, as to the ultimate fate of the two families turned back,
as may be said, on the threshold of success. The action of Kenton
and Boone told their anxiety to place them on the same side of
the Ohio with the block-house, and it indicated with equal certainty
the appearance of some frightful danger in their front.</p>

<p>That danger must be The Panther and his war party. Thus, it will
be perceived, that by a course of rapid reasoning the missionary
was approaching a correct idea of the situation.</p>

<p>He knew nothing of Rattlesnake Gulch, for the pioneer circuit
preachers of the west had to traverse too many vast areas of wilderness
to become minutely familiar with every portion; but the checking
of the fugitives, or the turning back of their real leader, could
mean but one thing; they had discovered the presence of The Panther
and his Shawanoes in their path.</p>

<p>All and considerably more than the foregoing being conceded,
the missionary could not but regard the turning over to him of
the invaluable canoe, to say nothing of the flatboat itself, as
providential. There was now abundant means to carry the imperiled
ones to the other shore.</p>

<p>But missionary Finley was too familiar with the people of the
West, and too well versed in woodcraft, to feel over-confidence,
or to believe that it was plain sailing into the haven of absolute
safety. If The Panther had cut off the flight of the fugitives
to the block-house, he was not the one to permit them to flank
the danger by means of the canoe.</p>

<p>The first step necessary, as it seemed to the good man, was to
open communication in some way with Simon Kenton.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea where he is?" he asked of Jethro.</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I feels purty suah, and it makes me feel bad."</p>

<p>"Where can he be?"</p>

<p>"He fell out dat canoe and got drownded; I feels bad 'cause I
neber oughter left Mr. Kenton alone. He took me 'long to hab care
ob him, and I outer feel dat I am to blame for his drownin'."</p>

<p>"Have no alarm about that. Kenton is too good a swimmer to lose
his life in that way."</p>

<p>"But he mout get de cramps."</p>

<p>"He might, but he didn't. He probably awaited your return as
long as it was safe, and then continued up the river to join his
friends. In some way he lost the canoe to the Shawanoe, who abandoned
it to me."</p>

<p>"I should tink dat he would come back to look for de boat."</p>

<p>"The same thought has occurred to me, I hope he has done so,
for then we shall be pretty sure to see him. But, after all, if
he set out for that purpose, he has probably given it up and returned,
or he would have shown himself before."</p>

<p>All this time the flatboat, with its broad spread of sail, was
gliding steadily up the Ohio, keeping as close as was prudent
to the Kentucky shore.</p>

<p>An odd thought had gradually assumed form in the mind of the
missionary. He had noted the headlong panic into which the single
Shawanoe was thrown by the sudden sight of the fantastic craft,
and he asked himself whether, such being the case, The Panther
and his warriors could not be temporarily frightened, and advantage
taken of it.</p>

<p>"At any rate it is worth trying," was his conclusion.</p>

<p>But in arriving at this belief, it did not occur to the good
man that the seeming apparition might produce the same effect
upon the white men as upon the Shawanoes.</p>
