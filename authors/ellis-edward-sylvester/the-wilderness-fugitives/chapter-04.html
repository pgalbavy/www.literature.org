<p>Rosa and Ned, without wish or intention on their part, were obtaining
some very interesting information from the Tory leader; and, as
the way was not clear as to a safe method of extricating themselves
from the position of eavesdroppers, they could do nothing more
than hold their peace and allow the entertainment to continue.</p>

<p>The Tory was enraged by the discovery that Rosa was the beloved
of another, who was probably doing all he could at that moment
to assist in placing her beyond his reach, and to raise himself
in her affection by such a display of devotion.</p>

<p>"When are you going to cross over?" inquired his companion.</p>

<p>"Right away&mdash;we have waited too long already. The evening is
well along, and we're losing time."</p>

<p>The sounds which succeeded showed that the party were moving
nearer the river shore, having been standing a few feet off while
holding the conversation. Back in the darkness of the wood, Rosa
and Ned were invisible, while they were able to catch the outlines
of the moving figures when thrown against the dim sky beyond.
It was plain that the party meant to use the canoe in which the
girl had spent a portion of the afternoon, and which, it was intended,
should serve as a vehicle to carry the whites to the other side.</p>

<p>The redmen were heard placing the boat in position, and the splash
of the paddle was noticed as all took their places, and the oarsman
assumed his duty of guiding the craft, burdened to its utmost
capacity, across the Susquehanna. Colonel Butler, who had been
so talkative a few minutes before, and also accommodating enough
to reveal his purposes to those most concerned, seemed to have
gone to the other extreme, for nothing more was heard from him.
Captain Bagley took upon himself the task of directing the movements
of the others, whenever they needed direction. The canoe, with
its occupants, left the shore and was impelled into the Susquehanna,
heading for the other bank, invisible in the gloom of the night.
Before the craft had vanished, however, Ned caught sight of a
couple of figures on the bank immediately in front of where he
was standing with Rosa.</p>

<p>"'Sh!" she whispered, detecting the fact at the same instant;
"they have left a couple behind."</p>

<p>At this instant one of the forms turned and advanced toward them,
the distance being so short that he had taken but a few steps
when he arrived.</p>

<p>"Did you see them?" he asked, when he was at their side.</p>

<p>"See them? Of course we did," replied Rosa, recognizing her brother,
"and we heard them, too. They've been standing and talking together
right here, close enough for us to hear every word they said."</p>

<p>"Well, what did they say?"</p>

<p>"It would be hard to tell what they didn't say," replied Rosa,
with something of her old spirit of mischief. "Colonel Butler
is very sweet on some young rebel, which I am afraid is about
my age, and looks very much like me. He has gone across the river
to catch me before I can reach Wilkesbarre, but I don't see why
he need be in a hurry, for I don't think we'll see that place
within a couple of weeks, unless Lena-Wingo gets in more of a
hurry than he is now."</p>

<p>This "satirical" remark was intended for the ears of the Mohawk,
who had approached during the last few seconds, and who did not
lose a syllable; but it would have taken more bitter words than
ever fell from those sweet lips to stir any resentful feelings
in his dusky breast.</p>

<p>"Talk much," was the only response he made, thereby uttering
a truth which not even the young lady herself would deny.</p>

<p>"What else did he say?" asked Jo, referring to Colonel Butler.</p>

<p>"Well, the substance of it all was that he had sent a lot of
Iroquois across the river to cut us off before we can reach Wilkesbarre,
and he has no doubt they will succeed. He goes over himself, so
as to be on hand, I believe, to take charge of me&mdash;that is, when
<em>they catch me</em>."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Do you think of anything more?" asked Rosa, addressing Ned.</p>

<p>"You have given all that was said&mdash;that is, all that is worth
telling," answered the young man, into whose brain were burned
some utterances which had not been referred to by his fair companion.</p>

<p>"If there is anything else," persisted Jo, "why, let's have it;
for though it may seem trifling to you, it may be of importance
when weighed by the Mohawk. Out with all you remember!"</p>

<p>"I have nothing more to tell," replied Ned, feeling the situation
becoming embarrassing.</p>

<p>"I forgot something else," added the girl, in a light manner,
that sent the shivers down the back of young Minturn, for his
instinct told him what was coming. "You can't ask me to tell you
all the bad words Colonel Butler used."</p>

<p>"Not unless you would like to go over them, but let me know what
it was that <em>caused</em> him to speak in that style?"</p>

<p>"Oh! but he had good cause for it all, for that wicked Captain
Bagley told him there was a young gentleman somewhere that thought
all the world of me, and of whom I thought all the world, and
the idea that I liked anybody else besides him was what made him
so angry. I believe you have <em>all</em> now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe I have," replied Jo, with a low laugh. "Jack
and I were standing almost as close to them as were you and Ned,
and we heard their conversation."</p>

<p>If the pretty sister had possessed a parasol, she would have
made her brother's head feel the weight thereof. All this was
pure jest that seemed to intrude itself by a law of physiology
into the hearts oppressed so long by grief, dread and anxiety.
But there was one heart upon which the airy words fell with a
weight of which the speakers never dreamed. To Ned Clinton there
was something cruel in this reference to his affection for Rosa.
He considered it a sacred secret&mdash;perhaps dimly suspected now
by Rosa herself&mdash;too sacred, indeed, to be spoken of in jest by
others.</p>

<p>He knew that his friends meant no unkindness, but it touched
him scarcely the less for all that. He and Rosa had passed a few
deep, earnest words, bearing upon that dream of the future which
he cherished so fondly, and not the words merely, but the tones,
the manner and the occasion gave them a significance which was
of the profoundest import to him; and now to hear the maiden refer
to them as she did pained him. Was it, then, all a jest to her?
Did she regard the picture he had faintly limned as one of those
unsubstantial dreams which the young and ambitious are so fond
of drawing, and which can never be realized? Did she look upon
him merely as a friend&mdash;a dear one, perhaps, whom she had known
and liked from their early childhood, because they had been schoolmates,
and he and her brother were friends?</p>

<p>In short, was it not evidence that she merely <em>liked</em>,
but felt nothing at all of <em>love</em>&mdash;that great over-mastering
emotion that pervaded and swayed his whole nature?</p>
