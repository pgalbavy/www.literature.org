<P>&quot;Well?&quot; cried Athos with a mild look of reproach when
D'Artagnan had read the letter addressed to him by Monk.</P>
<P>&quot;Well!&quot; said D'Artagnan, red with pleasure, and a little
with shame, at having so hastily accused the king and Monk.
&quot;This is a politeness,  -  which leads to nothing, it is
true, but yet it is a politeness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I had great difficulty in believing the young prince
ungrateful,&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;The fact is, that his present is still too near his past,&quot;
replied D'Artagnan; &quot;after all, everything to the present
moment proved me right.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I acknowledge it, my dear friend, I acknowledge it. Ah!
there is your cheerful look returned. You cannot think how
delighted I am.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thus you see,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;Charles II. receives M.
Monk at nine o'clock; he will receive me at ten; it is a
grand audience, of the sort which at the Louvre are called
`distributions of court holy water.' Come, let us go and
place ourselves under the spout, my dear friend! Come
along.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos replied nothing; and both directed their steps, at a
quick pace, towards the palace of St. James's, which the
crowd still surrounded, to catch, through the windows, the
shadows of the courtiers, and the reflection of the royal
person. Eight o'clock was striking when the two friends took
their places in the gallery filled with courtiers and
politicians. Every one looked at these simply-dressed men in
foreign costumes, at these two noble heads so full of
character and meaning. On their side, Athos and D'Artagnan,
having with two glances taken the measure of the whole
assembly, resumed their chat.</P>
<P>A great noise was suddenly heard at the extremity of the
gallery,  -  it was General Monk, who entered, followed by
more than twenty officers, all eager for a smile, as only
the evening before he was master of all England, and a
glorious morrow was looked to, for the restorer of the
Stuart family.</P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Monk, turning round, &quot;henceforward I beg
you to remember that I am no longer anything. Lately I
commanded the principal army of the republic; now that army
is the king's, into whose hands I am about to surrender, at
his command, my power of yesterday.&quot;</P>
<P>Great surprise was painted on all the countenances, and the
circle of adulators and suppliants which surrounded Monk an
instant before, was enlarged by degrees, and ended by being
lost in the large undulations of the crowd. Monk was going
into the ante-chamber as others did. D'Artagnan could not
help remarking this to the Comte de la Fere, who frowned on
beholding it. Suddenly the door of the royal apartment
opened, and the young king appeared, preceded by two
officers of his household.</P>
<P>&quot;Good evening, gentlemen,&quot; said he. &quot;Is General Monk here?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am here, sire,&quot; replied the old general.</P>
<P>Charles stepped hastily towards him, and seized his hand
with the warmest demonstration of friendship. &quot;General,&quot;
said the king, aloud, &quot;I have just signed your patent,  - 
you are Duke of Albemarle; and my intention is that no one
shall equal you in power and fortune in this kingdom, where
 -  the noble Montrose excepted  -  no one has equaled you in
loyalty, courage, and talent. Gentlemen, the duke is
commander of our armies of land and sea; pay him your
respects, if you please, in that character.&quot;</P>
<P>Whilst every one was pressing round the general, who
received all this homage without losing his impassibility
for an instant, D'Artagnan said to Athos: &quot;When one thinks
that this duchy, this commander of the land and sea forces,
all these grandeurs, in a word, have been shut up in a box
six feet long and three feet wide  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My friend,&quot; replied Athos, &quot;much more imposing grandeurs
are confined in boxes still smaller,  -  and remain there
forever.&quot;</P>
<P>All at once Monk perceived the two gentlemen, who held
themselves aside until the crowd had diminished; he made
himself a passage towards them, so that he surprised them in
the midst of their philosophical reflections. &quot;Were you
speaking of me?&quot; said he, with a smile.</P>
<P>&quot;My lord,&quot; replied Athos, &quot;we were speaking likewise of
God.&quot;</P>
<P>Monk reflected for a moment, and then replied gayly:
&quot;Gentlemen, let us speak a little of the king likewise, if
you please; for you have, I believe, an audience of his
majesty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At nine o'clock,&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;At ten o'clock,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Let us go into this closet at once,&quot; replied Monk, making a
sign to his two companions to precede him; but to that
neither would consent.</P>
<P>The king, during this discussion so characteristic of the
French, had returned to the center of the gallery.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! my Frenchmen!&quot; said he, in that tone of careless gayety
which, in spite of so much grief and so many crosses, he had
never lost. &quot;My Frenchmen! my consolation!&quot; Athos and
D'Artagnan bowed.</P>
<P>&quot;Duke, conduct these gentlemen into my study. I am at your
service, messieurs,&quot; added he in French. And he promptly
expedited his court, to return to his Frenchmen, as he
called them. &quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan,&quot; said he, as he entered
his closet, &quot;I am glad to see you again.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire, my joy is at its height, at having the honor to
salute your majesty in your own palace of St. James's.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur, you have been willing to render me a great
service, and I owe you my gratitude for it. If I did not
fear to intrude upon the rights of our commanding general, I
would offer you some post worthy of you near our person.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;I have quitted the service of
the king of France, making a promise to my prince not to
serve any other king.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Humph!&quot; said Charles, &quot;I am sorry to hear that; I should
like to do much for you; I like you very much.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But let us see,&quot; said Charles with a smile, &quot;if we cannot
make you break your word. Duke, assist me. If you were
offered, that is to say, if I offered you the chief command
of my musketeers?&quot; D'Artagnan bowed lower than before.</P>
<P>&quot;I should have the regret to refuse what your gracious
majesty would offer me,&quot; said he; &quot;a gentleman has but his
word, and that word, as I have had the honor to tell your
majesty, is engaged to the king of France.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We shall say no more about it, then,&quot; said the king,
turning towards Athos, and leaving D'Artagnan plunged in the
deepest pangs of disappointment.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! I said so!&quot; muttered the musketeer. &quot;Words! words!
Court holy water! Kings have always a marvellous talent for
offering us that which they know we will not accept, and in
appearing generous without risk. So be it!  -  triple fool
that I was to have hoped for a moment!&quot;</P>
<P>During this time Charles took the hand of Athos. &quot;Comte,&quot;
said he, &quot;you have been to me a second father; the services
you have rendered me are above all price. I have,
nevertheless, thought of a recompense. You were created by
my father a Knight of the Garter  - -that is an order which
all the kings of Europe cannot bear; by the queen regent,
Knight of the Holy Ghost  -  which is an order not less
illustrious; I join to it that of the Golden Fleece sent me
by the king of France, to whom the king of Spain, his
father-in-law, gave two on the occasion of his marriage; but
in return, I have a service to ask of you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire,&quot; said Athos. with confusion, &quot;the Golden Fleece for
me! when the king of France is the only person in my country
who enjoys that distinction?&quot;</P>
<P>I wish you to be in your country and all others the equal of
all those whom sovereigns have honored with their favor,&quot;
said Charles, drawing the chain from his neck; &quot;and I am
sure, comte, my father smiles on me from his grave.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is unaccountably strange,&quot; said D'Artagnan to himself,
whilst his friend, on his knees, received the eminent order
which the king conferred on him  -  &quot;it is almost incredible
that I have always seen showers of prosperity fall upon all
who surrounded me, and that not a drop ever reached me! If I
were a jealous man it would be enough to make one tear one's
hair, parole d'honneur!&quot;</P>
<P>Athos rose from his knees, and Charles embraced him
tenderly. &quot;General!&quot; said he to Monk  -  then stopping with a
smile, &quot;pardon me, duke, I mean. No wonder if I make a
mistake; the word duke is too short for me, I always seek
some title to lengthen it. I should wish to see you so near
my throne, that I might say to you as to Louis XIV., my
brother! Oh! I have it, and you will be almost my brother,
for I make you viceroy of Ireland and of Scotland. my dear
duke. So, after that fashion, henceforward I shall not make
a mistake.&quot;</P>
<P>The duke seized the hand of the king, but without
enthusiasm, without joy, as he did everything. His heart,
however, had been moved by this last favor. Charles, by
skillfully husbanding his generosity, had given the duke
time to wish, although he might not have wished for so much
as was given him.</P>
<P>&quot;Mordioux!&quot; grumbled D'Artagnan, &quot;there is the shower
beginning again! Oh! it is enough to turn one's brain!&quot; and
he turned away with an air so sorrowful and so comically
piteous, that the king, who caught it, could not restrain a
smile. Monk was preparing to leave the room, to take leave
of Charles.</P>
<P>&quot;What! my trusty and well-beloved!&quot; said the king to the
duke, &quot;are you going?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;With your majesty's permission, for in truth I am weary.
The emotions of the day have worn me out; I stand in need of
rest.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; said the king, &quot;you are not going without M.
d'Artagnan, I hope.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not, sire?&quot; said the old warrior.</P>
<P>&quot;Well! you know very well why,&quot; said the king.</P>
<P>Monk looked at Charles with astonishment.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! it may be possible; but if you forget, you, M.
d'Artagnan, do not.&quot;</P>
<P>Astonishment was painted on the face of the musketeer.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, duke,&quot; said the king, &quot;do you not lodge with M.
d'Artagnan?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I had the honor of offering M. d'Artagnan a lodging; yes,
sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That idea is your own, and yours solely?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mine and mine only; yes, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well! but it could not be otherwise  -  the prisoner always
lodges with his conqueror.&quot;</P>
<P>Monk colored in his turn. &quot;Ah! that is true,&quot; said he, &quot;I am
M. d'Artagnan's prisoner.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Without doubt, duke, since you are not yet ransomed, but
have no care of that; it was I who took you out of M.
d'Artagnan's hands, and it is I who will pay your ransom.&quot;</P>
<P>The eyes of D'Artagnan regained their gayety and their
brilliancy. The Gascon began to understand. Charles advanced
towards him.</P>
<P>&quot;The general,&quot; said he, &quot;is not rich, and cannot pay you
what he is worth. I am richer, certainly, but now that he is
a duke, and if not a king, almost a king, he is worth a sum
I could not perhaps pay. Come, M. d'Artagnan, be moderate
with me; how much do I owe you?&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan, delighted at the turn things were taking, but
not for a moment losing his self-possession, replied,  - 
&quot;Sire, your majesty has no occasion to be alarmed. When I
had the good fortune to take his grace, M. Monk was only a
general; it is therefore only a general's ransom that is due
to me. But if the general will have the kindness to deliver
me his sword, I shall consider myself paid; for there is
nothing in the world but the general's sword which is worth
so much as himself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Odds fish! as my father said,&quot; cried Charles. &quot;That is a
gallant proposal, and a gallant man, is he not, duke?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Upon my honor, yes, sire,&quot; and he drew his sword.
&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said he to D'Artagnan, &quot;here is what you demand.
Many may have handled a better blade; but however modest
mine may be, I have never surrendered it to any one.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan received with pride the sword which had just made
a king.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! oh!&quot; cried Charles II.; &quot;what, a sword that has
restored me to my throne  -  to go out of the kingdom  -  and
not, one day, to figure among the crown jewels. No, on my
soul! that shall not be! Captain d'Artagnan, I will give you
two hundred thousand crowns for your sword! If that is too
little, say so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is too little, sire,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, with
inimitable seriousness. &quot;In the first place, I do not at all
wish to sell it; but your majesty desires me to do so, and
that is an order. I obey, then, but the respect I owe to the
illustrious warrior who hears me commands me to estimate at
a third more the reward of my victory. I ask then three
hundred thousand crowns for the sword, or I shall give it to
your majesty for nothing.&quot; And taking it by the point he
presented it to the king. Charles broke into hilarious
laughter.</P>
<P>&quot;A gallant man, and a merry companion! Odds fish! is he not,
duke? is he not, comte? He pleases me! I like him! Here,
Chevalier d'Artagnan, take this.&quot; And going to the table, he
took a pen and wrote an order upon his treasurer for three
hundred thousand crowns.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan took it, and turning gravely towards Monk: &quot;I
have still asked too little, I know,&quot; said he, &quot;but believe
me, your grace, I would rather have died than allow myself
to be governed by avarice.&quot;</P>
<P>The king began to laugh again, like the happiest cockney of
his kingdom.</P>
<P>&quot;You will come and see me again before you go, chevalier?&quot;
said he; &quot;I shall want to lay in a stock of gayety now my
Frenchmen are leaving me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! sire, it will not be with the gayety as with the duke's
sword; I will give it to your majesty gratis,&quot; replied
D'Artagnan, whose feet scarcely seemed to touch the ground.</P>
<P>&quot;And you, comte,&quot; added Charles, turning towards Athos,
&quot;come again, also, I have an important message to confide to
you. Your hand, duke.&quot; Monk pressed the hand of the king.</P>
<P>&quot;Adieu! gentlemen,&quot; said Charles, holding out each of his
hands to the two Frenchmen, who carried them to their lips.</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said Athos, when they were out of the palace, &quot;are
you satisfied?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hush!&quot; said D'Artagnan, wild with joy, &quot;I have not yet
returned from the treasurer's  -  a shutter may fall upon my
head.&quot;</P></div>
