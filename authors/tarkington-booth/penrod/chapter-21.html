<p>For several days after this, Penrod thought of growing up to
be a monk, and engaged in good works so far as to carry some kittens
(that otherwise would have been drowned) and a pair of Margaret's
outworn dancing-slippers to a poor, ungrateful old man sojourning
in a shed up the alley. And although Mr. Robert Williams, after
a very short interval, began to leave his guitar on the front
porch again, exactly as if he thought nothing had happened, Penrod,
with his younger vision of a father's mood, remained coldly distant
from the Jones neighbourhood. With his own family his manner was
gentle, proud and sad, but not for long enough to frighten them.
The change came with mystifying abruptness at the end of the week.</p>

<p>It was Duke who brought it about.</p>

<p>Duke could chase a much bigger dog out of the Schofields' yard
and far down the street. This might be thought to indicate unusual
valour on the part of Duke and cowardice on that of the bigger
dogs whom he undoubtedly put to rout. On the contrary, all such
flights were founded in mere superstition, for dogs are even more
superstitious than boys and coloured people; and the most firmly
established of all dog superstitions is that any dog&mdash;be he the
smallest and feeblest in the world&mdash;can whip any trespasser whatsoever.</p>

<p>A rat-terrier believes that on his home grounds he can whip an
elephant. It follows, of course, that a big dog, away from his
own home, will run from a little dog in the little dog's neighbourhood.
Otherwise, the big dog must face a charge of inconsistency, and
dogs are as consistent as they are superstitious. A dog believes
in war, but he is convinced that there are times when it is moral
to run; and the thoughtful physiognomist, seeing a big dog fleeing
out of a little dog's yard, must observe that the expression of
the big dog's face is more conscientious than alarmed: it is the
expression of a person performing a duty to himself.</p>

<p>Penrod understood these matters perfectly; he knew that the gaunt
brown hound Duke chased up the alley had fled only out of deference
to a custom, yet Penrod could not refrain from bragging of Duke
to the hound's owner, a fat-faced stranger of twelve or thirteen,
who had wandered into the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"You better keep that ole yellow dog o' yours back," said Penrod
ominously, as he climbed the fence. "You better catch him and
hold him till I get mine inside the yard again. Duke's chewed
up some pretty bad bulldogs around here."</p>

<p>The fat-faced boy gave Penrod a fishy stare. "You'd oughta learn
him not to do that," he said. "It'll make him sick."</p>

<p>"What will?"</p>

<p>The stranger laughed raspingly and gazed up the alley, where
the hound, having come to a halt, now coolly sat down, and, with
an expression of roguish benevolence, patronizingly watched the
tempered fury of Duke, whose assaults and barkings were becoming
perfunctory.</p>

<p>"What'll make Duke sick?" Penrod demanded.</p>

<p>"Eatin' dead bulldogs people leave around here."</p>

<p>This was not improvisation but formula, adapted from other occasions
to the present encounter; nevertheless, it was new to Penrod,
and he was so taken with it that resentment lost itself in admiration.
Hastily committing the gem to memory for use upon a dog-owning
friend, he inquired in a sociable tone:</p>

<p>"What's your dog's name?"</p>

<p>"Dan. You better call your ole pup, 'cause Dan eats <em>LIVE
</em>dogs."</p>

<p>Dan's actions poorly supported his master's assertion, for, upon
Duke's ceasing to bark, Dan rose and showed the most courteous
interest in making the little, old dog's acquaintance. Dan had
a great deal of manner, and it became plain that Duke was impressed
favourably in spite of former prejudice, so that presently the
two trotted amicably back to their masters and sat down with the
harmonious but indifferent air of having known each other intimately
for years.</p>

<p>They were received without comment, though both boys looked at
them reflectively for a time. It was Penrod who spoke first.</p>

<p>"What number you go to?" (In an "oral lesson in English," Penrod
had been instructed to put this question in another form: "May
I ask which of our public schools you attend?")</p>

<p>"Me? What number do I go to?" said the stranger, contemptuously.
"I don't go to NO number in vacation!"</p>

<p>"I mean when it ain't."</p>

<p>"Third," returned the fat-faced boy. "I got 'em <em>ALL </em>scared
in <em>THAT </em>school."</p>

<p>"What of?" innocently asked Penrod, to whom "the Third"&mdash;in a
distant part of town&mdash;was undiscovered country.</p>

<p>"What of? I guess you'd soon see what of, if you ever was in
that school about one day. You'd be lucky if you got out alive!"</p>

<p>"Are the teachers mean?"</p>

<p>The other boy frowned with bitter scorn. "Teachers! Teachers
don't order ME around, I can tell you! They're mighty careful
how they try to run over Rupe Collins."</p>

<p>"Who's Rupe Collins?"</p>

<p>"Who is he?" echoed the fat-faced boy incredulously. "Say, ain't
you got <em>ANY </em>sense?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Say, wouldn't you be just as happy if you had <em>SOME </em>sense?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es." Penrod's answer, like the look he lifted to the impressive
stranger, was meek and placative. "Rupe Collins is the principal
at your school, guess."</p>

<p>The other yelled with jeering laughter, and mocked Penrod's manner
and voice. "'Rupe Collins is the principal at your school, I guess!'"
He laughed harshly again, then suddenly showed truculence. "Say,
'bo, whyn't you learn enough to go in the house when it rains?
What's the matter of you, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Well," urged Penrod timidly, "nobody ever <em>TOLD </em>me who
Rupe Collins is: I got a <em>RIGHT </em>to think he's the principal,
haven't I?"</p>

<p>The fat-faced boy shook his head disgustedly. "Honest, you make
me sick!"</p>

<p>Penrod's expression became one of despair. "Well, who IS he?"
he cried.</p>

<p>"'Who IS he?'" mocked the other, with a scorn that withered.
"'Who IS he?' ME!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" Penrod was humiliated but relieved: he felt that he had
proved himself criminally ignorant, yet a peril seemed to have
passed. "Rupe Collins is your name, then, I guess. I kind of thought
it was, all the time."</p>

<p>The fat-faced boy still appeared embittered, burlesquing this
speech in a hateful falsetto. "'Rupe Collins is <em>YOUR </em>name,
then, I guess!' Oh, you 'kind of thought it was, all the time,'
did you?" Suddenly concentrating his brow into a histrionic scowl
he thrust his face within an inch of Penrod's. "Yes, sonny, Rupe
Collins is my name, and you better look out what you say when
he's around or you'll get in big trouble! <em>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
'BO</em>?"</p>

<p>Penrod was cowed but fascinated: he felt that there was something
dangerous and dashing about this newcomer.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, feebly, drawing back. "My name's Penrod Schofield."</p>

<p>"Then I reckon your father and mother ain't got good sense,"
said Mr. Collins promptly, this also being formula.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"'Cause if they had they'd of give you a good name!" And the
agreeable youth instantly rewarded himself for the wit with another
yell of rasping laughter, after which he pointed suddenly at Penrod's
right hand.</p>

<p>"Where'd you get that wart on your finger?" he demanded severely.</p>

<p>"Which finger?" asked the mystified Penrod, extending his hand.</p>

<p>"The middle one."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed Rupe Collins, seizing and vigorously twisting
the wartless finger naively offered for his inspection.</p>

<p>"Quit!" shouted Penrod in agony. "<em>QUEE-</em>yut!"</p>

<p>"Say your prayers!" commanded Rupe, and continued to twist the
luckless finger until Penrod writhed to his knees.</p>

<p>"OW!" The victim, released, looked grievously upon the still
painful finger.</p>

<p>At this Rupe's scornful expression altered to one of contrition.
"Well, I declare!" he exclaimed remorsefully. "I didn't s'pose
it would hurt. Turn about's fair play; so now you do that to me."</p>

<p>He extended the middle finger of his left hand and Penrod promptly
seized it, but did not twist it, for he was instantly swung round
with his back to his amiable new acquaintance: Rupe's right hand
operated upon the back of Penrod's slender neck; Rupe's knee tortured
the small of Penrod's back.</p>

<p>"OW!" Penrod bent far forward involuntarily and went to his knees
again.</p>

<p>"Lick dirt," commanded Rupe, forcing the captive's face to the
sidewalk; and the suffering Penrod completed this ceremony.</p>

<p>Mr. Collins evinced satisfaction by means of his horse laugh.</p>

<p>"You'd last jest about one day up at the Third!" he said. "You'd
come runnin' home, yellin' '<em>MOM-MUH, MOM-</em>muh,' before
recess was over!"</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't," Penrod protested rather weakly, dusting his
knees.</p>

<p>"You would, too!"</p>

<p>"No, I w&#11834;</p>

<p>"Looky here," said the fat-faced boy, darkly, "what you mean,
counterdicking me?"</p>

<p>He advanced a step and Penrod hastily qualified his contradiction.</p>

<p>"I mean, I don't <em>THINK I </em>would. I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You better look out!" Rupe moved closer, and unexpectedly grasped
the back of Penrod's neck again. "Say, 'I <em>WOULD </em>run home
yellin' "<em>MOM-</em>muh!"'"</p>

<p>"Ow! I <em>WOULD </em>run home yellin' 'Mom-muh.'"</p>

<p>"There!" said Rupe, giving the helpless nape a final squeeze.
"That's the way we do up at the Third."</p>

<p>Penrod rubbed his neck and asked meekly:</p>

<p>"Can you do that to any boy up at the Third?"</p>

<p>"See here now," said Rupe, in the tone of one goaded beyond all
endurance, "<em>YOU </em>say if I can! You better say it quick,
or&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I knew you could," Penrod interposed hastily, with the pathetic
semblance of a laugh. "I only said that in fun."</p>

<p>"In 'fun'!" repeated Rupe stormily. "You better look out how
you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, I <em>SAID I </em>wasn't in earnest!" Penrod retreated
a few steps. "<em>I</em> knew you could, all the time. I expect
<em>I</em> could do it to some of the boys up at the Third, myself.
Couldn't I?"</p>

<p>"No, you couldn't."</p>

<p>"Well, there must be <em>SOME </em>boy up there that I could&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, they ain't! You better&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I expect not, then," said Penrod, quickly.</p>

<p>"You <em>BETTER '</em>expect not.' Didn't I tell you once you'd
never get back alive if you ever tried to come up around the Third?
You want me to <em>SHOW </em>you how we do up there, 'bo?"</p>

<p>He began a slow and deadly advance, whereupon Penrod timidly
offered a diversion:</p>

<p>"Say, Rupe, I got a box of rats in our stable under a glass cover,
so you can watch 'em jump around when you hammer on the box. Come
on and look at 'em."</p>

<p>"All right," said the fat-faced boy, slightly mollified. "We'll
let Dan kill 'em."</p>

<p>"No, <em>SIR! I'</em>m goin' to keep 'em. They're kind of pets;
I've had 'em all summer &mdash;I got names for em, and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Looky here, 'bo. Did you hear me say we'll let 'Dan kill 'em?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I won't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>WHAT </em>won't you?" Rupe became sinister immediately.
"It seems to me you're gettin' pretty fresh around here."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want&#11834;"</p>

<p>Mr. Collins once more brought into play the dreadful eye-to-eye
scowl as practised "up at the Third," and, sometimes, also by
young leading men upon the stage. Frowning appallingly, and thrusting
forward his underlip, he placed his nose almost in contact with
the nose of Penrod, whose eyes naturally became crossed.</p>

<p>"Dan kills the rats. See?" hissed the fat-faced boy, maintaining
the horrible juxtaposition.</p>

<p>"Well, all right," said Penrod, swallowing. "I don't want 'em
much."  And when the pose had been relaxed, he stared at his new
friend for a moment, almost with reverence. Then he brightened.</p>

<p>"Come on, Rupe!" he cried enthusiastically, as he climbed the
fence. "We'll give our dogs a little live meat&mdash;'bo!"</p>
