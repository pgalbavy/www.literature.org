<p>The question was settled. Nothing short of positive knowledge
could have led Deerfoot to change his mind as to the right course
to pursue.</p>

<p>Stooping over, he picked up his hunting knife, thrust it in his
girdle, and strode down the slope in the direction of the camp,
which he knew was deserted early that morning. It was a long way
to travel, but it was nothing to the lissome warrior, who would
have broken into a run could he have felt any assurance of gaining
any benefit by doing so.</p>

<p>Climbing around the boulders and rocks, leaping over chasms,
pushing through matted undergrowth, and turning aside only when
forced to do so, Deerfoot pressed to the southwest until three-fourths
of the distance was passed. Most of that time the shadowy vapor
had been beyond sight, for he did not take the trouble to look
for it when the intervening vegetation interfered. He could not
make any mistake as to the right course, and it was therefore
unnecessary for him to take his bearings; but now, when he knew
he could not be far from his destination, he came to the surface,
as it may be said of a diver in an emerald sea, and indulged in
a deliberate survey of his surroundings.</p>

<p>The first glance at the camp caused his eyes to sparkle, for
it conveyed an interesting fact: instead of the smoke being so
thin that it was scarcely visible, it was much denser and more
plenteous. That simply showed that the camp was no longer a deserted
one. Whoever had gone away in the morning had returned, and was
at that moment on the ground. More than likely there were several
of them, and, as the day was half gone, they were preparing their
noontide meal.</p>

<p>At any rate the Shawanoe was sure to find some one there, and
he hastened his footsteps, though he could feel but slight hope
that whatever he saw or learned would have a bearing on the business
in which his whole soul was engaged.</p>

<p>Deerfoot approached the camp with his usual caution, his supposition
being that a company of Indians were resting there for a brief
time. If they were Osages, or, indeed, any other tribe, except
Hurons or Wyandots, he would not hesitate to go forward and greet
them, for there ought to be no danger incurred in doing so. The
same would be the case with the whites, though some care might
be necessary to convince them no treachery was intended.</p>

<p>The first glimpse showed the Indian that only a single white
man was present. He was preparing dinner, the preliminary step
being a stirring of the smoldering camp-fire, which gave forth
the tell-tale smoke. He was a striking individual, though a stranger
to Deerfoot.</p>

<p>The fire itself was small, and was burning in an open space where
the whole neighborhood served as a chimney. Several feet off was
a half-decayed log, on which the man was sitting, his elbows on
his knees, and a long stick held loosely in his hands. This he
used as a poker, and it served his purpose well. A close approach
to the fire was apt to be unpleasant on account of the heat, so
he sat a short distance off, and managed things in a comfortable
fashion. Now and then he poked the embers until the end of the
vegetable poker broke into a blaze, when he withdrew it and whipped
it on the ground till the flame was put out. His rifle leaned
against an adjoining tree within easy distance, and the short
clay pipe in his mouth, from which he sent out an occasional puff,
added to his apparently peaceful frame of mind.</p>

<p>The striking point about the hunter was his magnificent physical
manhood. He was more than six feet high, with immense shoulders
and chest, an enormous beard of a coal black color, which grew
almost to his keen black eyes, and descended over his chest in
a silken, wavy mass. He was attired in the ordinary hunting costume
of the border, and looked as if he might be one of those men who
had spent their lives in the Louisiana wilderness, hunting and
trapping animals for their peltries, which were sold at some of
the advanced posts of civilization.</p>

<p>Deerfoot suspected the man was the owner of a horse which must
be in the vicinity, for it was hardly likely that he would wander
aimlessly around in the mountains and woods for the mere sake
of doing so, but no animal could be seen, and without speculating
long over the matter, the young Shawanoe walked forward to the
camp.</p>

<p>While doing so, the stranger was giving his full attention to
the fire and his culinary duties. The wood had burned until there
were enough coals, when he arose and raked them apart, so as to
afford a surface of glowing embers. Then he turned back and took
up a huge slice of meat, which had been skewered on the prongs
of a long stick. Balancing this very cleverly, he held the meat
down until it was almost against the crimson coals. He could have
done the same with the blaze, but he preferred this method.</p>

<p>Almost instantly the meat began to crisp and scorch and shrink,
and to give off an odor which would have tortured a hungry man.
The cook quickly exposed the other side to the heat, reversing
several times, when the venison was cooked in as appetizing a
form as could be wished.</p>

<p>The man gave such close attention to his task that he never turned
his head to observe the figure of an Indian warrior standing only
a rod or two away. Having finished his work, he carefully spread
the meat on some green oak leaves, arranged on the log. Its size
was such that it suggested a door mat burned somewhat out of shape.</p>

<p>"There," said the hunter, with a contented expression, seating
himself as if to guard the prize against disturbance; "the boys
can't growl over that&mdash;hello, where'd <em>you</em> come from?"</p>

<p>He had caught sight of Deerfoot, advancing noiselessly toward
him, and the man was startled (though he strove to conceal it)
by the fact that the other was nearer to his rifle than was the
owner.</p>

<p>The Indian saluted him in his courteous fashion, and with a view
of removing his fears, walked on until the relative position of
him and the man were changed, and the latter was nearer his gun.</p>

<p>Then he paused, retaining his standing position, and with a slight
smile, said:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is glad that his brother is not ill."</p>

<p>Undoubtedly that brother was relieved to find in case of dispute
he could reach his gun before the dusky youth, but he could hardly
believe the warrior voluntarily gave up the enormous advantage
thus held for a moment or two. Throwing his shoulders back, he
looked straight in the eyes of Deerfoot, and then rising to his
feet, extended his hand. As if conscious of his superior height,
he towered aloft and looked down on the graceful youth who met
his gaze with a confiding expression that would have won the heart
of any one.</p>

<p>The abundant beard hid the mouth of the white man, but the movement
of the cheeks, the gathering wrinkles under the eyes, and the
gleam of his white teeth through the black meshes, showed he was
smiling. Instead of saluting in the usual fashion, he brought
his hand down with a flourish, and grasping the palm of the youth
pressed it with a vigor which made him wince.</p>

<p>"So you're Deerfoot, are you? I mean the young Shawanoe that
used to hunt through Kentucky and Missouri."</p>

<p>The Indian nodded his head to signify that he was the individual
whom the other had in mind.</p>

<p>"I'm Burt Hawkins&mdash;you remember me?" asked he, still pumping
the arm of Deerfoot, who was compelled to admit he had never before
heard the name, nor could he remember ever having looked upon
his face.</p>

<p>"Well, you have done so, whether you remember it or not: three
years ago, which, I reckon, was about the time you began tramping
through the woods for the benefit of the white man, I was on a
scout with Kenton and some of the boys, over in Kentucky. We got
caught in a blinding snow storm, and all came near going under
with a rush. Things got so bad that Kenton said we would have
to give up, for, tough as he was, he was weakening. The snow was
driving so hard you couldn't see six feet in front of you. Cold!
Well, the wind was of that kind that it went right through your
bones as though it was a knife. Night was coming on, and we were
in the middle of the woods, twenty miles from everywhere. The
only thing we could do was to let out a yell once in a while,
and fire off our guns. I don't think there was one among the five
that had the first grain of hope. Kenton was leading and I was
at his heels; all I could see was his tall figure, covered from
head to foot with snow, as he plodded along with the grit he always
showed.</p>

<p>"The first thing I knowed some one j'ined us&mdash;a young, likely
looking Injin, which his name was Deerfoot. He had heard our guns
and dropped down from somewhere. You're grinning, old chap, so
I guess there ain't much use of telling the rest, 'cause you know
it. I'll never forget how you led us into that cave, where you
had fixed up the logs and bark so that no snow flakes couldn't
get in. There was a fire burning, and some buffalo meat cooking,
and we couldn't have been better fixed if we had been lodged with
Colonel Preston at Live Oaks or in St. Louis."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot has not forgotten," said the smiling Indian, seating
himself beside Hawkins on the log; "but my brother did not look
then as he looks now."</p>

<p>Again the head of the trapper was thrown back, his white teeth
shone through his immense whiskers, the wrinkles gathered at the
corner of his eyes, and his musical laugh rang out from the capillary
depths. Burt was proud of his beard, as he well might be. Few
people in those days wore such an ornament, and those who did
so were sure to attract attention.</p>

<p>"You talk like a level-headed gentleman, Deerfoot, for all this
(here he stroked the glossy whiskers) has grown since then. I
shouldn't wonder if it <em>did</em> change my looks somewhat.
You're a blamed smart redskin, Deerfoot," added Burt, who seemed
to be in high spirits; "but I don't believe you can beat it."</p>

<p>It was the turn of Deerfoot to laugh, and he did so with much
heartiness, though without any noise.</p>

<p>"No; the hair of Deerfoot grows on his head; he would be sad
if it covered his face."</p>

<p>"So would I, for it would make a confounded queer looking creatur'
of you. I would like to see an Injin got up in that style; just
think of Tecumseh with a big mustache and whiskers! Beavers!"</p>

<p>The conceit was equally enjoyed by Deerfoot, who fairly shook
with mirth. He recalled the time when he confronted the mighty
chieftain, with drawn knife and compressed lips, and the picture
of that terrible being, with his face covered by whiskers, was
a drop from the sublime to the ridiculous, which would have brought
a laugh to any one.</p>

<p>Burt Hawkins evidently held his visitor in esteem, for, reaching
out his horny hand, he gently passed his fingers over the cheek
nearest him, and then drew it across the chin.</p>

<p>"No; there's no beard there. It's as smooth as the cheeks of
my little five-year old Peggy at home. It always struck me as
qu'ar that Injins don't have beards, but I s'pose it's because
the old fellows, several thousand years ago, began plucking out
the hairs that came on the face, and their children have kept
it up so long that it has discouraged the industry in them regions.
See?"</p>

<p>To assist Deerfoot to catch the force of his illustration, Burt
gave him several digs in the ribs. This familiarity would have
been annoying under most circumstances, but it was manifest from
the manner of the warrior that he rather enjoyed the effusiveness
of the magnificent fellow.</p>

<p>"Why is my brother in the woods alone?" he asked, when matters
calmed down.</p>

<p>"I can't say I'm exactly alone, Deerfoot, for Kit Kellogg and
Tom Crumpet ain't fur off, and that meat thar is gettin' cold
waiting for them to come and gobble it; if they ain't here in
a few minutes you and me will insert our teeth. We've been trappin'
all winter down to the south'rd and have got a good pile of peltries;
we've got 'em gathered, and loaded, too, and are on our way to
St. Louis with 'em; warm weather is comin', and the furs are beginnin'
to get poor, so we shall hang our harps on the willers till cold
weather begins agin."</p>

<p>"My brothers are coming," said Deerfoot, quietly, referring to
two other hunters who at that moment put in an appearance.</p>
