<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Henry Wimbush brought down with him to dinner a budget of printed
sheets loosely bound together in a cardboard portfolio.</p>

<p>"To-day," he said, exhibiting it with a certain solemnity, "to-day
I have finished the printing of my ‘History of Crome’. I helped
to set up the type of the last page this evening."</p>

<p>"The famous History?" cried Anne. The writing and the printing
of this Magnum Opus had been going on as long as she could remember.
All her childhood long Uncle Henry’s History had been a vague
and fabulous thing, often heard of and never seen.</p>

<p>"It has taken me nearly thirty years," said Mr. Wimbush. "Twenty-five
years of writing and nearly four of printing. And now it’s finished&mdash;the
whole chronicle, from Sir Ferdinando Lapith’s birth to the death
of my father William Wimbush&mdash;more than three centuries and a
half: a history of Crome, written at Crome, and printed at Crome
by my own press."</p>

<p>"Shall we be allowed to read it now it’s finished?" asked Denis.</p>

<p>Mr. Wimbush nodded. "Certainly," he said. "And I hope you will
not find it uninteresting," he added modestly. "Our muniment room
is particularly rich in ancient records, and I have some genuinely
new light to throw on the introduction of the three-pronged fork."</p>

<p>"And the people?" asked Gombauld. "Sir Ferdinando and the rest
of them&mdash;were they amusing? Were there any crimes or tragedies
in the family?"</p>

<p>"Let me see," Henry Wimbush rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "I
can only think of two suicides, one violent death, four or perhaps
five broken hearts, and half a dozen little blots on the scutcheon
in the way of misalliances, seductions, natural children, and
the like. No, on the whole, it’s a placid and uneventful record."</p>

<p>"The Wimbushes and the Lapiths were always an unadventurous,
respectable crew," said Priscilla, with a note of scorn in her
voice. "If I were to write my family history now! Why, it would
be one long continuous blot from beginning to end." She laughed
jovially, and helped herself to another glass of wine.</p>

<p>"If I were to write mine," Mr. Scogan remarked, "it wouldn’t
exist. After the second generation we Scogans are lost in the
mists of antiquity."</p>

<p>"After dinner," said Henry Wimbush, a little piqued by his wife’s
disparaging comment on the masters of Crome, "I’ll read you an
episode from my History that will make you admit that even the
Lapiths, in their own respectable way, had their tragedies and
strange adventures."</p>

<p>"I’m glad to hear it," said Priscilla.</p>

<p>"Glad to hear what?" asked Jenny, emerging suddenly from her
private interior world like a cuckoo from a clock. She received
an explanation, smiled, nodded, cuckooed at last "I see," and
popped back, clapping shut the door behind her.</p>

<p>Dinner was eaten; the party had adjourned to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Now," said Henry Wimbush, pulling up a chair to the lamp. He
put on his round pince-nez, rimmed with tortoise-shell, and began
cautiously to turn over the pages of his loose and still fragmentary
book. He found his place at last. "Shall I begin?" he asked, looking
up.</p>

<p>"Do," said Priscilla, yawning.</p>

<p>In the midst of an attentive silence Mr. Wimbush gave a little
preliminary cough and started to read.</p>

<p>"The infant who was destined to become the fourth baronet of
the name of Lapith was born in the year 1740. He was a very small
baby, weighing not more than three pounds at birth, but from the
first he was sturdy and healthy. In honour of his maternal grandfather,
Sir Hercules Occam of Bishop’s Occam, he was christened Hercules.
His mother, like many other mothers, kept a notebook, in which
his progress from month to month was recorded. He walked at ten
months, and before his second year was out he had learnt to speak
a number of words. At three years he weighed but twenty-four pounds,
and at six, though he could read and write perfectly and showed
a remarkable aptitude for music, he was no larger and heavier
than a well-grown child of two. Meanwhile, his mother had borne
two other children, a boy and a girl, one of whom died of croup
during infancy, while the other was carried off by smallpox before
it reached the age of five. Hercules remained the only surviving
child.</p>

<p>"On his twelfth birthday Hercules was still only three feet and
two inches in height. His head, which was very handsome and nobly
shaped, was too big for his body, but otherwise he was exquisitely
proportioned, and, for his size, of great strength and agility.
His parents, in the hope of making him grow, consulted all the
most eminent physicians of the time. Their various prescriptions
were followed to the letter, but in vain. One ordered a very plentiful
meat diet; another exercise; a third constructed a little rack,
modelled on those employed by the Holy Inquisition, on which young
Hercules was stretched, with excruciating torments, for half an
hour every morning and evening. In the course of the next three
years Hercules gained perhaps two inches. After that his growth
stopped completely, and he remained for the rest of his life a
pigmy of three feet and four inches. His father, who had built
the most extravagant hopes upon his son, planning for him in his
imagination a military career equal to that of Marlborough, found
himself a disappointed man. ‘I have brought an abortion into the
world,’ he would say, and he took so violent a dislike to his
son that the boy dared scarcely come into his presence. His temper,
which had been serene, was turned by disappointment to moroseness
and savagery. He avoided all company (being, as he said, ashamed
to show himself, the father of a lusus naturae, among normal,
healthy human beings), and took to solitary drinking, which carried
him very rapidly to his grave; for the year before Hercules came
of age his father was taken off by an apoplexy. His mother, whose
love for him had increased with the growth of his father’s unkindness,
did not long survive, but little more than a year after her husband’s
death succumbed, after eating two dozen of oysters, to an attack
of typhoid fever.</p>

<p>"Hercules thus found himself at the age of twenty-one alone in
the world, and master of a considerable fortune, including the
estate and mansion of Crome. The beauty and intelligence of his
childhood had survived into his manly age, and, but for his dwarfish
stature, he would have taken his place among the handsomest and
most accomplished young men of his time. He was well read in the
Greek and Latin authors, as well as in all the moderns of any
merit who had written in English, French, or Italian. He had a
good ear for music, and was no indifferent performer on the violin,
which he used to play like a bass viol, seated on a chair with
the instrument between his legs. To the music of the harpsichord
and clavichord he was extremely partial, but the smallness of
his hands made it impossible for him ever to perform upon these
instruments. He had a small ivory flute made for him, on which,
whenever he was melancholy, he used to play a simple country air
or jig, affirming that this rustic music had more power to clear
and raise the spirits than the most artificial productions of
the masters. From an early age he practised the composition of
poetry, but, though conscious of his great powers in this art,
he would never publish any specimen of his writing. ‘My stature,’
he would say, ‘is reflected in my verses; if the public were to
read them it would not be because I am a poet, but because I am
a dwarf.’ Several <em>MS. </em>books of Sir Hercules’s poems survive.
A single specimen will suffice to illustrate his qualities as
a poet."</p>

"‘In ancient days, while yet the world was young,

</p>
<p>
Ere Abram fed his flocks or Homer sung;

</p>
<p>
When blacksmith Tubal tamed creative fire,

</p>
<p>
And Jabal dwelt in tents and Jubal struck the lyre;

</p>
<p>
Flesh grown corrupt brought forth a monstrous birth

</p>
<p>
And obscene giants trod the shrinking earth,

</p>
<p>
Till God, impatient of their sinful brood,

</p>
<p>
Gave rein to wrath and drown’d them in the Flood.

</p>
<p>
Teeming again, repeopled Tellus bore

</p>
<p>
The lubber Hero and the Man of War;

</p>
<p>
Huge towers of Brawn, topp’d with an empty Skull,

</p>
<p>
Witlessly bold, heroically dull.

</p>
<p>
Long ages pass’d and Man grown more refin’d,

</p>
<p>
Slighter in muscle but of vaster Mind,

</p>
<p>
Smiled at his grandsire’s broadsword, bow and bill,

</p>
<p>
And learn’d to wield the Pencil and the Quill.

</p>
<p>
The glowing canvas and the written page

</p>
<p>
Immortaliz’d his name from age to age,

</p>
<p>
His name emblazon’d on Fame’s temple wall;

</p>
<p>
For Art grew great as Humankind grew small.

</p>
<p>
Thus man’s long progress step by step we trace;

</p>
<p>
The Giant dies, the hero takes his place;

</p>
<p>
The Giant vile, the dull heroic Block:

</p>
<p>
At one we shudder and at one we mock.

</p>
<p>
Man last appears. In him the Soul’s pure flame

</p>
<p>
Burns brightlier in a not inord’nate frame.

</p>
<p>
Of old when Heroes fought and Giants swarmed,

</p>
<p>
Men were huge mounds of matter scarce inform’d;

</p>
<p>
Wearied by leavening so vast a mass,

</p>
<p>
The spirit slept and all the mind was crass.

</p>
<p>
The smaller carcase of these later days

</p>
<p>
Is soon inform’d; the Soul unwearied plays

</p>
<p>
And like a Pharos darts abroad her mental rays.

</p>
<p>
But can we think that Providence will stay

</p>
<p>
Man’s footsteps here upon the upward way?

</p>
<p>
Mankind in understanding and in grace

</p>
<p>
Advanc’d so far beyond the Giants’ race?

</p>
<p>
Hence impious thought! Still led by <em>GOD’S </em>own Hand,

</p>
<p>
Mankind proceeds towards the Promised Land.

</p>
<p>
A time will come (prophetic, I descry

</p>
<p>
Remoter dawns along the gloomy sky),

</p>
<p>
When happy mortals of a Golden Age

</p>
<p>
Will backward turn the dark historic page,

</p>
<p>
And in our vaunted race of Men behold

</p>
<p>
A form as gross, a Mind as dead and cold,

</p>
<p>
As we in Giants see, in warriors of old.

</p>
<p>
A time will come, wherein the soul shall be

</p>
<p>
From all superfluous matter wholly free;

</p>
<p>
When the light body, agile as a fawn’s,

</p>
<p>
Shall sport with grace along the velvet lawns.

</p>
<p>
Nature’s most delicate and final birth,

</p>
<p>
Mankind perfected shall possess the earth.

</p>
<p>
But ah, not yet! For still the Giants’ race,

</p>
<p>
Huge, though diminish’d, tramps the Earth’s fair face;

</p>
<p>
Gross and repulsive, yet perversely proud,

</p>
<p>
Men of their imperfections boast aloud.

</p>
<p>
Vain of their bulk, of all they still retain

</p>
<p>
Of giant ugliness absurdly vain;

</p>
<p>
At all that’s small they point their stupid scorn

</p>
<p>
And, monsters, think themselves divinely born.

</p>
<p>
Sad is the Fate of those, ah, sad indeed,

</p>
<p>
The rare precursors of the nobler breed!

</p>
<p>
Who come man’s golden glory to foretell,

</p>
<p>
But pointing Heav’nwards live themselves in Hell.’

</p>
</div>
<p>"As soon as he came into the estate, Sir Hercules set about remodelling
his household. For though by no means ashamed of his deformity&mdash;indeed,
if we may judge from the poem quoted above, he regarded himself
as being in many ways superior to the ordinary race of man&mdash;he
found the presence of full-grown men and women embarrassing. Realising,
too, that he must abandon all ambitions in the great world, he
determined to retire absolutely from it and to create, as it were,
at Crome a private world of his own, in which all should be proportionable
to himself. Accordingly, he discharged all the old servants of
the house and replaced them gradually, as he was able to find
suitable successors, by others of dwarfish stature. In the course
of a few years he had assembled about himself a numerous household,
no member of which was above four feet high and the smallest among
them scarcely two feet and six inches. His father’s dogs, such
as setters, mastiffs, greyhounds, and a pack of beagles, he sold
or gave away as too large and too boisterous for his house, replacing
them by pugs and King Charles spaniels and whatever other breeds
of dog were the smallest. His father’s stable was also sold. For
his own use, whether riding or driving, he had six black Shetland
ponies, with four very choice piebald animals of New Forest breed.</p>

<p>"Having thus settled his household entirely to his own satisfaction,
it only remained for him to find some suitable companion with
whom to share his paradise. Sir Hercules had a susceptible heart,
and had more than once, between the ages of sixteen and twenty,
felt what it was to love. But here his deformity had been a source
of the most bitter humiliation, for, having once dared to declare
himself to a young lady of his choice, he had been received with
laughter. On his persisting, she had picked him up and shaken
him like an importunate child, telling him to run away and plague
her no more. The story soon got about&mdash;indeed, the young lady
herself used to tell it as a particularly pleasant anecdote&mdash;and
the taunts and mockery it occasioned were a source of the most
acute distress to Hercules. From the poems written at this period
we gather that he meditated taking his own life. In course of
time, however, he lived down this humiliation; but never again,
though he often fell in love, and that very passionately, did
he dare to make any advances to those in whom he was interested.
After coming to the estate and finding that he was in a position
to create his own world as he desired it, he saw that, if he was
to have a wife&mdash;which he very much desired, being of an affectionate
and, indeed, amorous temper&mdash;he must choose her as he had chosen
his servants&mdash;from among the race of dwarfs. But to find a suitable
wife was, he found, a matter of some difficulty; for he would
marry none who was not distinguished by beauty and gentle birth.
The dwarfish daughter of Lord Bemboro he refused on the ground
that besides being a pigmy she was hunchbacked; while another
young lady, an orphan belonging to a very good family in Hampshire,
was rejected by him because her face, like that of so many dwarfs,
was wizened and repulsive. Finally, when he was almost despairing
of success, he heard from a reliable source that Count Titimalo,
a Venetian nobleman, possessed a daughter of exquisite beauty
and great accomplishments, who was by three feet in height. Setting
out at once for Venice, he went immediately on his arrival to
pay his respects to the count, whom he found living with his wife
and five children in a very mean apartment in one of the poorer
quarters of the town. Indeed, the count was so far reduced in
his circumstances that he was even then negotiating (so it was
rumoured) with a travelling company of clowns and acrobats, who
had had the misfortune to lose their performing dwarf, for the
sale of his diminutive daughter Filomena. Sir Hercules arrived
in time to save her from this untoward fate, for he was so much
charmed by Filomena’s grace and beauty, that at the end of three
days’ courtship he made her a formal offer of marriage, which
was accepted by her no less joyfully than by her father, who perceived
in an English son-in-law a rich and unfailing source of revenue.
After an unostentatious marriage, at which the English ambassador
acted as one of the witnesses, Sir Hercules and his bride returned
by sea to England, where they settled down, as it proved, to a
life of uneventful happiness.</p>

<p>"Crome and its household of dwarfs delighted Filomena, who felt
herself now for the first time to be a free woman living among
her equals in a friendly world. She had many tastes in common
with her husband, especially that of music. She had a beautiful
voice, of a power surprising in one so small, and could touch
A in alt without effort. Accompanied by her husband on his fine
Cremona fiddle, which he played, as we have noted before, as one
plays a bass viol, she would sing all the liveliest and tenderest
airs from the operas and cantatas of her native country. Seated
together at the harpsichord, they found that they could with their
four hands play all the music written for two hands of ordinary
size, a circumstance which gave Sir Hercules unfailing pleasure.</p>

<p>"When they were not making music or reading together, which they
often did, both in English and Italian, they spent their time
in healthful outdoor exercises, sometimes rowing in a little boat
on the lake, but more often riding or driving, occupations in
which, because they were entirely new to her, Filomena especially
delighted. When she had become a perfectly proficient rider, Filomena
and her husband used often to go hunting in the park, at that
time very much more extensive than it is now. They hunted not
foxes nor hares, but rabbits, using a pack of about thirty black
and fawn-coloured pugs, a kind of dog which, when not overfed,
can course a rabbit as well as any of the smaller breeds. Four
dwarf grooms, dressed in scarlet liveries and mounted on white
Exmoor ponies, hunted the pack, while their master and mistress,
in green habits, followed either on the black Shetlands or on
the piebald New Forest ponies. A picture of the whole hunt&mdash;dogs,
horses, grooms, and masters&mdash;was painted by William Stubbs, whose
work Sir Hercules admired so much that he invited him, though
a man of ordinary stature, to come and stay at the mansion for
the purpose of executing this picture. Stubbs likewise painted
a portrait of Sir Hercules and his lady driving in their green
enamelled calash drawn by four black Shetlands. Sir Hercules wears
a plum-coloured velvet coat and white breeches; Filomena is dressed
in flowered muslin and a very large hat with pink feathers. The
two figures in their gay carriage stand out sharply against a
dark background of trees; but to the left of the picture the trees
fall away and disappear, so that the four black ponies are seen
against a pale and strangely lurid sky that has the golden-brown
colour of thunder-clouds lighted up by the sun.</p>

<p>"In this way four years passed happily by. At the end of that
time Filomena found herself great with child. Sir Hercules was
overjoyed. ‘If God is good,’ he wrote in his day-book, ‘the name
of Lapith will be preserved and our rarer and more delicate race
transmitted through the generations until in the fullness of time
the world shall recognise the superiority of those beings whom
now it uses to make mock of.’ On his wife’s being brought to bed
of a son he wrote a poem to the same effect. The child was christened
Ferdinando in memory of the builder of the house.</p>

<p>"With the passage of the months a certain sense of disquiet began
to invade the minds of Sir Hercules and his lady. For the child
was growing with an extraordinary rapidity. At a year he weighed
as much as Hercules had weighed when he was three. ‘Ferdinando
goes crescendo,’ wrote Filomena in her diary. ‘It seems not natural.’
At eighteen months the baby was almost as tall as their smallest
jockey, who was a man of thirty-six. Could it be that Ferdinando
was destined to become a man of the normal, gigantic dimensions?
It was a thought to which neither of his parents dared yet give
open utterance, but in the secrecy of their respective diaries
they brooded over it in terror and dismay.</p>

<p>"On his third birthday Ferdinando was taller than his mother
and not more than a couple of inches short of his father’s height.
‘To-day for the first time’ wrote Sir Hercules, ‘we discussed
the situation. The hideous truth can be concealed no longer: Ferdinando
is not one of us. On this, his third birthday, a day when we should
have been rejoicing at the health, the strength, and beauty of
our child, we wept together over the ruin of our happiness. God
give us strength to bear this cross.’</p>

<p>"At the age of eight Ferdinando was so large and so exuberantly
healthy that his parents decided, though reluctantly, to send
him to school. He was packed off to Eton at the beginning of the
next half. A profound peace settled upon the house. Ferdinando
returned for the summer holidays larger and stronger than ever.
One day he knocked down the butler and broke his arm. ‘He is rough,
inconsiderate, unamenable to persuasion,’ wrote his father. ‘The
only thing that will teach him manners is corporal chastisement.’
Ferdinando, who at this age was already seventeen inches taller
than his father, received no corporal chastisement.</p>

<p>"One summer holidays about three years later Ferdinando returned
to Crome accompanied by a very large mastiff dog. He had bought
it from an old man at Windsor who had found the beast too expensive
to feed. It was a savage, unreliable animal; hardly had it entered
the house when it attacked one of Sir Hercules’s favourite pugs,
seizing the creature in its jaws and shaking it till it was nearly
dead. Extremely put out by this occurrence, Sir Hercules ordered
that the beast should be chained up in the stable-yard. Ferdinando
sullenly answered that the dog was his, and he would keep it where
he pleased. His father, growing angry, bade him take the animal
out of the house at once, on pain of his utmost displeasure. Ferdinando
refused to move. His mother at this moment coming into the room,
the dog flew at her, knocked her down, and in a twinkling had
very severely mauled her arm and shoulder; in another instant
it must infallibly have had her by the throat, had not Sir Hercules
drawn his sword and stabbed the animal to the heart. Turning on
his son, he ordered him to leave the room immediately, as being
unfit to remain in the same place with the mother whom he had
nearly murdered. So awe-inspiring was the spectacle of Sir Hercules
standing with one foot on the carcase of the gigantic dog, his
sword drawn and still bloody, so commanding were his voice, his
gestures, and the expression of his face that Ferdinando slunk
out of the room in terror and behaved himself for all the rest
of the vacation in an entirely exemplary fashion. His mother soon
recovered from the bites of the mastiff, but the effect on her
mind of this adventure was ineradicable; from that time forth
she lived always among imaginary terrors.</p>

<p>"The two years which Ferdinando spent on the Continent, making
the Grand Tour, were a period of happy repose for his parents.
But even now the thought of the future haunted them; nor were
they able to solace themselves with all the diversions of their
younger days. The Lady Filomena had lost her voice and Sir Hercules
was grown too rheumatical to play the violin. He, it is true,
still rode after his pugs, but his wife felt herself too old and,
since the episode of the mastiff, too nervous for such sports.
At most, to please her husband, she would follow the hunt at a
distance in a little gig drawn by the safest and oldest of the
Shetlands.</p>

<p>"The day fixed for Ferdinando’s return came round. Filomena,
sick with vague dreads and presentiments, retired to her chamber
and her bed. Sir Hercules received his son alone. A giant in a
brown travelling-suit entered the room. ‘Welcome home, my son,’
said Sir Hercules in a voice that trembled a little.</p>

<p>"‘I hope I see you well, sir.’ Ferdinando bent down to shake
hands, then straightened himself up again. The top of his father’s
head reached to the level of his hip.</p>

<p>"Ferdinando had not come alone. Two friends of his own age accompanied
him, and each of the young men had brought a servant. Not for
thirty years had Crome been desecrated by the presence of so many
members of the common race of men. Sir Hercules was appalled and
indignant, but the laws of hospitality had to be obeyed. He received
the young gentlemen with grave politeness and sent the servants
to the kitchen, with orders that they should be well cared for.</p>

<p>"The old family dining-table was dragged out into the light and
dusted (Sir Hercules and his lady were accustomed to dine at a
small table twenty inches high). Simon, the aged butler, who could
only just look over the edge of the big table, was helped at supper
by the three servants brought by Ferdinando and his guests.</p>

<p>"Sir Hercules presided, and with his usual grace supported a
conversation on the pleasures of foreign travel, the beauties
of art and nature to be met with abroad, the opera at Venice,
the singing of the orphans in the churches of the same city, and
on other topics of a similar nature. The young men were not particularly
attentive to his discourses; they were occupied in watching the
efforts of the butler to change the plates and replenish the glasses.
They covered their laughter by violent and repeated fits of coughing
or choking. Sir Hercules affected not to notice, but changed the
subject of the conversation to sport. Upon this one of the young
men asked whether it was true, as he had heard, that he used to
hunt the rabbit with a pack of pug dogs. Sir Hercules replied
that it was, and proceeded to describe the chase in some detail.
The young men roared with laughter.</p>

<p>"When supper was over, Sir Hercules climbed down from his chair
and, giving as his excuse that he must see how his lady did, bade
them good-night. The sound of laughter followed him up the stairs.
Filomena was not asleep; she had been lying on her bed listening
to the sound of enormous laughter and the tread of strangely heavy
feet on the stairs and along the corridors. Sir Hercules drew
a chair to her bedside and sat there for a long time in silence,
holding his wife’s hand and sometimes gently squeezing it. At
about ten o’clock they were startled by a violent noise. There
was a breaking of glass, a stamping of feet, with an outburst
of shouts and laughter. The uproar continuing for several minutes,
Sir Hercules rose to his feet and, in spite of his wife’s entreaties,
prepared to go and see what was happening. There was no light
on the staircase, and Sir Hercules groped his way down cautiously,
lowering himself from stair to stair and standing for a moment
on each tread before adventuring on a new step. The noise was
louder here; the shouting articulated itself into recognisable
words and phrases. A line of light was visible under the dining-room
door. Sir Hercules tiptoed across the hall towards it. Just as
he approached the door there was another terrific crash of breaking
glass and jangled metal. What could they be doing? Standing on
tiptoe he managed to look through the keyhole. In the middle of
the ravaged table old Simon, the butler, so primed with drink
that he could scarcely keep his balance, was dancing a jig. His
feet crunched and tinkled among the broken glass, and his shoes
were wet with spilt wine. The three young men sat round, thumping
the table with their hands or with the empty wine bottles, shouting
and laughing encouragement. The three servants leaning against
the wall laughed too. Ferdinando suddenly threw a handful of walnuts
at the dancer’s head, which so dazed and surprised the little
man that he staggered and fell down on his back, upsetting a decanter
and several glasses. They raised him up, gave him some brandy
to drink, thumped him on the back. The old man smiled and hiccoughed.
‘To-morrow,’ said Ferdinando, ‘we’ll have a concerted ballet of
the whole household.’ ‘With father Hercules wearing his club and
lion-skin,’ added one of his companions, and all three roared
with laughter.</p>

<p>"Sir Hercules would look and listen no further. He crossed the
hall once more and began to climb the stairs, lifting his knees
painfully high at each degree. This was the end; there was no
place for him now in the world, no place for him and Ferdinando
together.</p>

<p>"His wife was still awake; to her questioning glance he answered,
‘They are making mock of old Simon. To-morrow it will be our turn.’
They were silent for a time.</p>

<p>"At last Filomena said, ‘I do not want to see to-morrow.’</p>

<p>"‘It is better not,’ said Sir Hercules. Going into his closet
he wrote in his day-book a full and particular account of all
the events of the evening. While he was still engaged in this
task he rang for a servant and ordered hot water and a bath to
be made ready for him at eleven o’clock. When he had finished
writing he went into his wife’s room, and preparing a dose of
opium twenty times as strong as that which she was accustomed
to take when she could not sleep, he brought it to her, saying,
‘Here is your sleeping-draught.’</p>

<p>"Filomena took the glass and lay for a little time, but did not
drink immediately. The tears came into her eyes. ‘Do you remember
the songs we used to sing, sitting out there sulla terrazza in
the summer-time?’ She began singing softly in her ghost of a cracked
voice a few bars from Stradella’s ‘Amor amor, non dormir piu.’
‘And you playing on the violin, it seems such a short time ago,
and yet so long, long, long. Addio, amore, a rivederti.’ She drank
off the draught and, lying back on the pillow, closed her eyes.
Sir Hercules kissed her hand and tiptoed away, as though he were
afraid of waking her. He returned to his closet, and having recorded
his wife’s last words to him, he poured into his bath the water
that had been brought up in accordance with his orders. The water
being too hot for him to get into the bath at once, he took down
from the shelf his copy of Suetonius. He wished to read how Seneca
had died. He opened the book at random. ‘But dwarfs,’ he read,
‘he held in abhorrence as being lusus naturae and of evil omen.’
He winced as though he had been struck. This same Augustus, he
remembered, had exhibited in the amphitheatre a young man called
Lucius, of good family, who was not quite two feet in height and
weighed seventeen pounds, but had a stentorian voice. He turned
over the pages. Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero: it was a tale
of growing horror. ‘Seneca his preceptor, he forced to kill himself.’
And there was Petronius, who had called his friends about him
at the last, bidding them talk to him, not of the consolations
of philosophy, but of love and gallantry, while the life was ebbing
away through his opened veins. Dipping his pen once more in the
ink he wrote on the last page of his diary: ‘He died a Roman death.’
Then, putting the toes of one foot into the water and finding
that it was not too hot, he threw off his dressing-gown and, taking
a razor in his hand, sat down in the bath. With one deep cut he
severed the artery in his left wrist, then lay back and composed
his mind to meditation. The blood oozed out, floating through
the water in dissolving wreaths and spirals. In a little while
the whole bath was tinged with pink. The colour deepened; Sir
Hercules felt himself mastered by an invincible drowsiness; he
was sinking from vague dream to dream. Soon he was sound asleep.
There was not much blood in his small body."</p>
