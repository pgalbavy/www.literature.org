<p> "Ships!" exclaimed an elderly seaman in clean shore togs.  "Ships"—and
his keen glance, turning away from my face, ran along the vista
of magnificent figure-heads that in the late seventies used to
overhang in a serried rank the muddy pavement by the side of the
New South Dock—"ships are all right; it’s the men in ’em. . ."</p>

<p>Fifty hulls, at least, moulded on lines of beauty and speed—hulls
of wood, of iron, expressing in their forms the highest achievement
of modern ship-building—lay moored all in a row, stem to quay,
as if assembled there for an exhibition, not of a great industry,
but of a great art.  Their colours were gray, black, dark green,
with a narrow strip of yellow moulding defining their sheer, or
with a row of painted ports decking in warlike decoration their
robust flanks of cargo-carriers that would know no triumph but
of speed in carrying a burden, no glory other than of a long service,
no victory but that of an endless, obscure contest with the sea. 
The great empty hulls with swept holds, just out of dry-dock,
with their paint glistening freshly, sat high-sided with ponderous
dignity alongside the wooden jetties, looking more like unmovable
buildings than things meant to go afloat; others, half loaded,
far on the way to recover the true sea-physiognomy of a ship brought
down to her load-line, looked more accessible.  Their less steeply
slanting gangways seemed to invite the strolling sailors in search
of a berth to walk on board and try "for a chance" with the chief
mate, the guardian of a ship’s efficiency.  As if anxious to remain
unperceived amongst their overtopping sisters, two or three "finished"
ships floated low, with an air of straining at the leash of their
level headfasts, exposing to view their cleared decks and covered
hatches, prepared to drop stern first out of the labouring ranks,
displaying the true comeliness of form which only her proper sea-trim
gives to a ship.  And for a good quarter of a mile, from the dockyard
gate to the farthest corner, where the old housed-in hulk, the
<em>President</em> (drill-ship, then, of the Naval Reserve), used
to lie with her frigate side rubbing against the stone of the
quay, above all these hulls, ready and unready, a hundred and
fifty lofty masts, more or less, held out the web of their rigging
like an immense net, in whose close mesh, black against the sky,
the heavy yards seemed to be entangled and suspended.</p>

<p>It was a sight.  The humblest craft that floats makes its appeal
to a seaman by the faithfulness of her life; and this was the
place where one beheld the aristocracy of ships.  It was a noble
gathering of the fairest and the swiftest, each bearing at the
bow the carved emblem of her name, as in a gallery of plaster-casts,
figures of women with mural crowns, women with flowing robes,
with gold fillets on their hair or blue scarves round their waists,
stretching out rounded arms as if to point the way; heads of men
helmeted or bare; full lengths of warriors, of kings, of statesmen,
of lords and princesses, all white from top to toe; with here
and there a dusky turbaned figure, bedizened in many colours,
of some Eastern sultan or hero, all inclined forward under the
slant of mighty bowsprits as if eager to begin another run of
11,000 miles in their leaning attitudes.  These were the fine
figure-heads of the finest ships afloat.  But why, unless for
the love of the life those effigies shared with us in their wandering
impassivity, should one try to reproduce in words an impression
of whose fidelity there can be no critic and no judge, since such
an exhibition of the art of shipbuilding and the art of figure-head
carving as was seen from year’s end to year’s end in the open-air
gallery of the New South Dock no man’s eye shall behold again?
All that patient, pale company of queens and princesses, of kings
and warriors, of allegorical women, of heroines and statesmen
and heathen gods, crowned, helmeted, bare-headed, has run for
good off the sea stretching to the last above the tumbling foam
their fair, rounded arms; holding out their spears, swords, shields,
tridents in the same unwearied, striving forward pose.  And nothing
remains but lingering perhaps in the memory of a few men, the
sound of their names, vanished a long time ago from the first
page of the great London dailies; from big posters in railway-stations
and the doors of shipping offices; from the minds of sailors,
dockmasters, pilots, and tugmen; from the hail of gruff voices
and the flutter of signal flags exchanged between ships closing
upon each other and drawing apart in the open immensity of the
sea.</p>

<p>The elderly, respectable seaman, withdrawing his gaze from that
multitude of spars, gave me a glance to make sure of our fellowship
in the craft and mystery of the sea.  We had met casually, and
had got into contact as I had stopped near him, my attention being
caught by the same peculiarity he was looking at in the rigging
of an obviously new ship, a ship with her reputation all to make
yet in the talk of the seamen who were to share their life with
her.  Her name was already on their lips.  I had heard it uttered
between two thick, red-necked fellows of the semi-nautical type
at the Fenchurch Street Railway-station, where, in those days,
the everyday male crowd was attired in jerseys and pilot-cloth
mostly, and had the air of being more conversant with the times
of high-water than with the times of the trains.  I had noticed
that new ship’s name on the first page of my morning paper.  I
had stared at the unfamiliar grouping of its letters, blue on
white ground, on the advertisement-boards, whenever the train
came to a standstill alongside one of the shabby, wooden, wharf-like
platforms of the dock railway-line. She had been named, with proper
observances, on the day she came off the stocks, no doubt, but
she was very far yet from "having a name." Untried, ignorant of
the ways of the sea, she had been thrust amongst that renowned
company of ships to load for her maiden voyage.  There was nothing
to vouch for her soundness and the worth of her character, but
the reputation of the building-yard whence she was launched headlong
into the world of waters.  She looked modest to me.  I imagined
her diffident, lying very quiet, with her side nestling shyly
against the wharf to which she was made fast with very new lines,
intimidated by the company of her tried and experienced sisters
already familiar with all the violences of the ocean and the exacting
love of men.  They had had more long voyages to make their names
in than she had known weeks of carefully tended life, for a new
ship receives as much attention as if she were a young bride.
Even crabbed old dock-masters look at her with benevolent eyes. 
In her shyness at the threshold of a laborious and uncertain life,
where so much is expected of a ship, she could not have been better
heartened and comforted, had she only been able to hear and understand,
than by the tone of deep conviction in which my elderly, respectable
seaman repeated the first part of his saying, "Ships are all right
. . ."</p>

<p>His civility prevented him from repeating the other, the bitter
part.  It had occurred to him that it was perhaps indelicate to
insist.  He had recognised in me a ship’s officer, very possibly
looking for a berth like himself, and so far a comrade, but still
a man belonging to that sparsely-peopled after-end of a ship,
where a great part of her reputation as a "good ship," in seaman’s
parlance, is made or marred.</p>

<p>"Can you say that of all ships without exception?" I asked, being
in an idle mood, because, if an obvious ship’s officer, I was
not, as a matter of fact, down at the docks to "look for a berth,"
an occupation as engrossing as gambling, and as little favourable
to the free exchange of ideas, besides being destructive of the
kindly temper needed for casual intercourse with one’s fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>"You can always put up with ’em," opined the respectable seaman
judicially.</p>

<p>He was not averse from talking, either.  If he had come down
to the dock to look for a berth, he did not seem oppressed by
anxiety as to his chances.  He had the serenity of a man whose
estimable character is fortunately expressed by his personal appearance
in an unobtrusive, yet convincing, manner which no chief officer
in want of hands could resist. And, true enough, I learned presently
that the mate of the <em>Hyperion</em> had "taken down" his name
for quarter-master.  "We sign on Friday, and join next day for
the morning tide," he remarked, in a deliberate, careless tone,
which contrasted strongly with his evident readiness to stand
there yarning for an hour or so with an utter stranger.</p>

<p>"<em>Hyperion</em>," I said.  "I don’t remember ever seeing that
ship anywhere. What sort of a name has she got?"</p>

<p>It appeared from his discursive answer that she had not much
of a name one way or another.  She was not very fast.  It took
no fool, though, to steer her straight, he believed.  Some years
ago he had seen her in Calcutta, and he remembered being told
by somebody then, that on her passage up the river she had carried
away both her hawse-pipes.  But that might have been the pilot’s
fault.  Just now, yarning with the apprentices on board, he had
heard that this very voyage, brought up in the Downs, outward
bound, she broke her sheer, struck adrift, and lost an anchor
and chain.  But that might have occurred through want of careful
tending in a tideway.  All the same, this looked as though she
were pretty hard on her ground-tackle.  Didn’t it?  She seemed
a heavy ship to handle, anyway.  For the rest, as she had a new
captain and a new mate this voyage, he understood, one couldn’t
say how she would turn out. . . .</p>

<p>In such marine shore-talk as this is the name of a ship slowly
established, her fame made for her, the tale of her qualities
and of her defects kept, her idiosyncrasies commented upon with
the zest of personal gossip, her achievements made much of, her
faults glossed over as things that, being without remedy in our
imperfect world, should not be dwelt upon too much by men who,
with the help of ships, wrest out a bitter living from the rough
grasp of the sea.  All that talk makes up her "name," which is
handed over from one crew to another without bitterness, without
animosity, with the indulgence of mutual dependence, and with
the feeling of close association in the exercise of her perfections
and in the danger of her defects.</p>

<p>This feeling explains men’s pride in ships.  "Ships are all right,"
as my middle-aged, respectable quartermaster said with much conviction
and some irony; but they are not exactly what men make them. 
They have their own nature; they can of themselves minister to
our self-esteem by the demand their qualities make upon our skill
and their shortcomings upon our hardiness and endurance.  Which
is the more flattering exaction it is hard to say; but there is
the fact that in listening for upwards of twenty years to the
sea-talk that goes on afloat and ashore I have never detected
the true note of animosity.  I won’t deny that at sea, sometimes,
the note of profanity was audible enough in those chiding interpellations
a wet, cold, weary seaman addresses to his ship, and in moments
of exasperation is disposed to extend to all ships that ever were
launched—to the whole everlastingly exacting brood that swims
in deep waters.  And I have heard curses launched at the unstable
element itself, whose fascination, outlasting the accumulated
experience of ages, had captured him as it had captured the generations
of his forebears.</p>

<p>For all that has been said of the love that certain natures (on
shore) have professed to feel for it, for all the celebrations
it had been the object of in prose and song, the sea has never
been friendly to man.  At most it has been the accomplice of human
restlessness, and playing the part of dangerous abettor of world-wide
ambitions.  Faithful to no race after the manner of the kindly
earth, receiving no impress from valour and toil and self-sacrifice,
recognising no finality of dominion, the sea has never adopted
the cause of its masters like those lands where the victorious
nations of mankind have taken root, rocking their cradles and
setting up their gravestones.  He—man or people—who, putting his
trust in the friendship of the sea, neglects the strength and
cunning of his right hand, is a fool!  As if it were too great,
too mighty for common virtues, the ocean has no compassion, no
faith, no law, no memory.  Its fickleness is to be held true to
men’s purposes only by an undaunted resolution and by a sleepless,
armed, jealous vigilance, in which, perhaps, there has always
been more hate than love.  <em>Odi et amo</em> may well be the
confession of those who consciously or blindly have surrendered
their existence to the fascination of the sea.  All the tempestuous
passions of mankind’s young days, the love of loot and the love
of glory, the love of adventure and the love of danger, with the
great love of the unknown and vast dreams of dominion and power,
have passed like images reflected from a mirror, leaving no record
upon the mysterious face of the sea. Impenetrable and heartless,
the sea has given nothing of itself to the suitors for its precarious
favours.  Unlike the earth, it cannot be subjugated at any cost
of patience and toil.  For all its fascination that has lured
so many to a violent death, its immensity has never been loved
as the mountains, the plains, the desert itself, have been loved.
Indeed, I suspect that, leaving aside the protestations and tributes
of writers who, one is safe in saying, care for little else in
the world than the rhythm of their lines and the cadence of their
phrase, the love of the sea, to which some men and nations confess
so readily, is a complex sentiment wherein pride enters for much,
necessity for not a little, and the love of ships—the untiring
servants of our hopes and our self-esteem—for the best and most
genuine part.  For the hundreds who have reviled the sea, beginning
with Shakespeare in the line—</p>

<p>
"More fell than hunger, anguish, or the sea,"

</p>
</div>
<p>down to the last obscure sea-dog of the "old model," having but
few words and still fewer thoughts, there could not be found,
I believe, one sailor who has ever coupled a curse with the good
or bad name of a ship.  If ever his profanity, provoked by the
hardships of the sea, went so far as to touch his ship, it would
be lightly, as a hand may, without sin, be laid in the way of
kindness on a woman.</p>
