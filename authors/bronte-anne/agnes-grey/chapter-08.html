AT eighteen, Miss Murray was to emerge from the quiet obscurity of
the schoolroom into the full blaze of the fashionable world - as
much of it, at least, as could be had out of London; for her papa
could not be persuaded to leave his rural pleasures and pursuits,
even for a few weeks' residence in town.  She was to make her debut
on the third of January, at a magnificent ball, which her mamma
proposed to give to all the nobility and choice gentry of O- and
its neighbourhood for twenty miles round.  Of course, she looked
forward to it with the wildest impatience, and the most extravagant
anticipations of delight.
<P>
'Miss Grey,' said she, one evening, a month before the all-
important day, as I was perusing a long and extremely interesting
letter of my sister's - which I had just glanced at in the morning
to see that it contained no very bad news, and kept till now,
unable before to find a quiet moment for reading it, - 'Miss Grey,
do put away that dull, stupid letter, and listen to me!  I'm sure
my talk must be far more amusing than that.'
<P>
She seated herself on the low stool at my feet; and I, suppressing
a sigh of vexation, began to fold up the epistle.
<P>
'You should tell the good people at home not to bore you with such
long letters,' said she; 'and, above all, do bid them write on
proper note-paper, and not on those great vulgar sheets.  You
should see the charming little lady-like notes mamma writes to her
friends.'
<P>
'The good people at home,' replied I, 'know very well that the
longer their letters are, the better I like them.  I should be very
sorry to receive a charming little lady-like note from any of them;
and I thought you were too much of a lady yourself, Miss Murray, to
talk about the "vulgarity" of writing on a large sheet of paper.'
<P>
'Well, I only said it to tease you.  But now I want to talk about
the ball; and to tell you that you positively must put off your
holidays till it is over.'
<P>
'Why so? - I shall not be present at the ball.'
<P>
'No, but you will see the rooms decked out before it begins, and
hear the music, and, above all, see me in my splendid new dress.  I
shall be so charming, you'll be ready to worship me - you really
must stay.'
<P>
'I should like to see you very much; but I shall have many
opportunities of seeing you equally charming, on the occasion of
some of the numberless balls and parties that are to be, and I
cannot disappoint my friends by postponing my return so long.'
<P>
'Oh, never mind your friends!  Tell them we won't let you go.'
<P>
'But, to say the truth, it would be a disappointment to myself:  I
long to see them as much as they to see me - perhaps more.'
<P>
'Well, but it is such a short time.'
<P>
'Nearly a fortnight by my computation; and, besides, I cannot bear
the thoughts of a Christmas spent from home:  and, moreover, my
sister is going to be married.'
<P>
'Is she - when?'
<P>
'Not till next month; but I want to be there to assist her in
making preparations, and to make the best of her company while we
have her.'
<P>
'Why didn't you tell me before?'
<P>
'I've only got the news in this letter, which you stigmatize as
dull and stupid, and won't let me read.'
<P>
'To whom is she to be married?'
<P>
'To Mr. Richardson, the vicar of a neighbouring parish.'
<P>
'Is he rich?'
<P>
'No; only comfortable.'
<P>
'Is he handsome?'
<P>
'No; only decent.'
<P>
'Young?'
<P>
'No; only middling.'
<P>
'Oh, mercy! what a wretch!  What sort of a house is it?'
<P>
'A quiet little vicarage, with an ivy-clad porch, an old-fashioned
garden, and - '
<P>
'Oh, stop! - you'll make me sick.  How CAN she bear it?'
<P>
'I expect she'll not only be able to bear it, but to be very happy.
You did not ask me if Mr. Richardson were a good, wise, or amiable
man; I could have answered Yes, to all these questions - at least
so Mary thinks, and I hope she will not find herself mistaken.'
<P>
'But - miserable creature! how can she think of spending her life
there, cooped up with that nasty old man; and no hope of change?'
<P>
'He is not old:  he's only six or seven and thirty; and she herself
is twenty-eight, and as sober as if she were fifty.'
<P>
'Oh! that's better then - they're well matched; but do they call
him the "worthy vicar"?'
<P>
'I don't know; but if they do, I believe he merits the epithet.'
<P>
'Mercy, how shocking! and will she wear a white apron and make pies
and puddings?'
<P>
'I don't know about the white apron, but I dare say she will make
pies and puddings now and then; but that will be no great hardship,
as she has done it before.'
<P>
'And will she go about in a plain shawl, and a large straw bonnet,
carrying tracts and bone soup to her husband's poor parishioners?'
<P>
'I'm not clear about that; but I dare say she will do her best to
make them comfortable in body and mind, in accordance with our
mother's example.'
