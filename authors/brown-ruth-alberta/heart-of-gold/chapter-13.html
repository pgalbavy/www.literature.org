<p>"Well, Peace, my dear little Peace, I am afraid the time has
come for me to leave you."</p>

<p>Miss Wayne had entered the sick room noiselessly, and, pausing
beside the wheel-chair, stood looking with tenderly wistful eyes
down at the face of her small charge, who, propped up among her
pillows, was animatedly watching the traffic in the street below.</p>

<p>"O, Miss Wayne," Peace, so engrossed with what she had seen that
she did not catch the significance of the nurse's remark, lifted
her bright shining eyes to the face above her and giggled, "why
didn't you come sooner? You missed the biggest sight of your life.
It was <em>so</em> funny! There was a runaway, and the horse chased
across our lawn just as Dr. Canfield came up the walk. He had
his med'cine case in one hand and an umbrella in the other, and
he let out a big yell and began to wave them both around his head
while he danced up and down in front of the horse. I guess he
was trying to keep it out of a garden in the middle of the yard,
but the old beast didn't shoo worth a cent, and the doctor had
to do some lively dodging to get out of its way. He is so short
and fat and pudgy that he did look too funny for anything, hopping
around like a rubber ball and squealing like a pig. He kept a-hollering,
'O, my cannons, oh, my cannons!' But the horse went straight through
the garden just the same, and now the doctor's down on his knees
in the mud digging up some onions and looking 'em all over carefully."</p>

<p>Miss Wayne's merry laugh joined in with that of her patient,
and following Peace's example, she pressed her face against the
window pane and looked down at the panting, puffing figure on
the muddy, trampled turf below. "It's his cannas," she explained.
"He always has an immense bed of red canna lilies in the center
of the lawn every summer. They are the pride of his heart, and
I can imagine what he felt like to have a team plough through
his precious garden. Fortunately, it is so early in the Spring
that the bulbs have not yet sprouted, so I guess there is not
much damage done. 'Canfield's Cannas' is a hospital joke. I wish
I could have seen his encounter with that runaway."</p>

<p>Wiping the mirthful tears from her eyes, she turned to the tiny
closet in the corner of the room, dragged forth a suitcase, and
began to take down some garments from the hooks, preparatory to
packing.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Wayne," cried Peace, her attention attracted by the
sound of the valise on the floor. "Whatever are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Gathering up my scattered belongings ready for departure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Departure!" echoed the child in great dismay. "Why, where are
you going?"</p>

<p>"I have another case, my dear, which needs my attention."</p>

<p>"But you can't go now! You've got me to look after."</p>

<p>"My dear child!" cried the woman in shocked surprise. "Do you
mean to say that no one has told you that I must go?"</p>

<p>"I hain't heard a word about it before," declared the distressed
Peace. "<em>Why</em> do you have to go?"</p>

<p>"You don't need me any longer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I <em>want</em> you. <em>Please</em> don't go!"</p>

<p>"I must, childie. It is no longer necessary for you to have a
special nurse. Your sister is here almost all the daytime, and
you are getting around splendidly in your wheel-chair."</p>

<p>"But can't folks have special nurses when they don't <em>need</em>
them, but just <em>want</em> them?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, if they have plenty of money so they can afford it,
but it is a needless expense, and as you will have to stay here
for many weeks yet, you surely don't want to make your grandfather
pay extra for a special nurse whose work is done, do you?"</p>

<p>"<em>N&mdash;</em>o," Peace reluctantly replied. "But I like you.
I &mdash;I don't want you to go&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"I am very glad you feel that way, girlie, but you see how it
is, don't you? Of course, Dr. Campbell won't listen to my going
if you insist upon my staying, but you don't mean to be selfish,
I know."</p>

<p>"I don't b'lieve you care," pouted Peace.</p>

<p>"Ah, my child, you can never know how much!" answered the woman
with unexpected warmth; and Peace, convinced, cried contritely,
"I didn't mean that, Miss Wayne, truly. But, oh, how I hate to
have you go! It'll be so lonesome!"</p>

<p>"O, no. You are progressing famously in the handling of your
chair, and now you can carry a little sunshine into the other
sick rooms. Lots of patients will be delighted to see our little
canary,&mdash;you know that is what the little lady down the hall has
called you ever since she heard you whistling so merrily the other
day."</p>

<p>The thin face brightened. "Yes, it will be lovely to get acquainted
with all these sick folks," she acknowledged, "but that won't
make up for losing you."</p>

<p>Miss Wayne smiled her appreciation of the compliment, as she
replied, "You won't lose me entirely yet. My new case is to be
here in the hospital, too. The ambulance will bring him in this
afternoon; so perhaps you will see quite a little of me for some
weeks&mdash;days to come."</p>

<p>"O, goody! That will be nice, if I <em>must</em> give you up,
to have you still in the hospital. Who is your new patient?"</p>

<p>"An old, old gentleman who fell on the pavement yesterday and
fractured his hip."</p>

<p>"Does Dr. Dick take care of him?"</p>

<p>"No, he is Dr. Race's patient."</p>

<p>"O, dear! S'posing Dr. Race won't let you come and see me sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Then you come and see me."</p>

<p>"That's so. I can go in my chair, can't I? How nice it is to
be able to get about by yourself again, when it's been so you
couldn't for such a long time!" And Peace rolled the light chair
across the floor to watch the brief process of packing, while
she laid eager plans for seeing her beloved nurse each day.</p>

<p>But she did miss the dear woman very much at first. Being cared
for by general nurses, who must be summoned by bell every time
they are needed, is vastly different from having one special nurse
constantly within call; and Peace felt this difference keenly
in spite of Gail's daily presence. But as Miss Wayne had predicted,
she found her wheel-chair a great diversion and a source of much
amusement. It was such fun to be able to propel one's self along
the wide corridors and Peace's natural curiosity and investigative
habit were never so well satisfied as when she was poking about
to see for herself what was happening around her.</p>

<p>Her reputation had preceded her all over the great building,
and as soon as the other invalids learned that she had graduated
to a wheel-chair, they were one and all eager to make her acquaintance;
so Peace spent many happy hours forming friendships among the
inmates of Danbury Hospital. Her sunny disposition seemed contagious,
and the nurses welcomed the sight of her bright face, knowing
that she would bring cheer into their domains if anyone could;
for, in spite of her amazing frankness, there was something quaintly
attractive in her speech and manner that was irresistible, and
every heart felt better for having known her.</p>

<p>One day, as she was gliding noiselessly down the deserted corridor,
the elevator stopped at that floor and another wheel-chair patient
rolled out into view.</p>

<p>"Now why didn't I think of that before," exclaimed Peace to herself.
"The wards are on the third floor and I've never seen them yet.
I'm going up."</p>

<p>To think was to act, and when next the lift stood still at the
second floor, Peace rolled her chair into the iron cage and said
in matter-of-fact tones, "Three."</p>

<p>The operator glared at her suspiciously, but she seemed so cheerfully
unconcerned that he decided she must have permission to visit
the wards; so he closed the iron gate with a clang, and the elevator
rose slowly to the floor above.</p>

<p>As the wheel-chair glided out into the upper corridor, Peace
glanced curiously about her, marvelling to see so many doors closed.
Then, as her sharp eyes spied one door standing open far down
the hall, she started in that direction, but halted at the sound
of a stifled sob, seemingly almost beside her.</p>

<p>Peering into a dim recess by the elevator shaft, which had at
one time evidently been used for a store-room, Peace discovered
a figure huddled forlornly in the corner, weeping disconsolately.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter?" cried the brown-eyed girl, her mind
flying back to school days and punishments. "Have you been bad
and got stood in a corner?"</p>

<p>The weeper started violently, dropped her bandaged hands and
stared in frightened wonder at the child before her, but she made
no reply, and again Peace demanded, "What seems to be the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Sh!" hissed the stranger. "Don't yell like that. Come inside
if you are bound to stop. I've run away from my nurse."</p>

<p>"Can <em>you</em> run?"</p>

<p>"Well, walked, then. She left me in the sun-parlor, b&mdash;but I
can't s&mdash;stay there with everyone staring and asking q&mdash;questions."
And again the tears began to fall.</p>

<p>"Shall I call your nurse?" Peace inquired, uneasy and alarmed
at the vehemence of the older girl's grief.</p>

<p>"No! No! For goodness' sake, no! She won't let me cry, and I've
<em>got</em> to, or&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bu'st," suggested Peace, nodding her head sympathetically. "Yes,
I know how 'tis. The nurse I had the first time after I was hurt
wouldn't let me cry, either. But this time Miss Wayne never said
'boo,' when I couldn't hold in any longer. She'd let me have it
all out by myself and then she'd come and tell me a funny story.
<em>She</em> had sense."</p>

<p>"I wish Miss Pierson had some. She's always preaching sunshine
and smiles. It's no wonder that girl downstairs can whistle and
laugh. <em>She's</em> got folks to look after her all her life,
and money to buy anything she wants."</p>

<p>"What girl?" asked Peace, with a curious sinking of heart.</p>

<p>"They call her Peace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's me, I thought 'twas. The d'scription seemed to fit so
well."</p>

<p>The stranger drew back aghast, then said bitterly, "I might have
known it."</p>

<p>"Don't you like me?" pleaded the child, feeling that her companion
had grown suddenly antagonistic.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I hate you!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;why?" stammered Peace, thunder-struck by this uncompromising
declaration.</p>

<p>"Because you have everything I need, and I can't have anything."</p>

<p>"You have good legs," Peace wistfully whispered.</p>

<p>"And you have good hands," her companion shot forth.</p>

<p>"Hands!" Peace all at once became aware of the bandages which
hid that other pair of hands from sight. "Wh&mdash;hat's the matter
with yours? Did you hurt them? Have you got <em>any</em>?"</p>

<p>"Apologies!" Her voice was harsh with intense bitterness, her
eyes were dull with despair.</p>

<p>"Apologies?" Peace failed to understand.</p>

<p>"They are useless. I burned them," explained the other hopelessly.</p>

<p>"But won't they <em>ever</em> be any good?" Peace persisted,
her eyes wide with horror.</p>

<p>"No, I can never write again."</p>

<p>"Write?"</p>

<p>"I write stories for a living. It's all I can do when I have
to stay at home with Mother and Benny. And now &mdash;God! what
is there left for me to do?"</p>

<p>"You swore."</p>

<p>"I did not."</p>

<p>"Then maybe you prayed. Was it a prayer?"</p>

<p>"I can't pray. It's useless to pray. Those two hands brought
in my bread and butter,&mdash;the bread and butter for us three. And
now they are hopelessly crippled. What can I pray for?"</p>

<p>"Your bread and butter."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" The girl laughed derisively, then broke off abruptly.
"You don't understand," she said in lifeless tones.</p>

<p>"No," Peace agreed, "p'r'aps I don't. 'Twas <em>my</em> feet.
How did you come to burn your hands?"</p>

<p>"Benny upset a lamp, and &mdash;I had to put out the fire. He
can't run, either. He is a cripple."</p>

<p>"Oh!" the voice was sharp with distress, and in spite of herself,
the older girl's face softened. "You&mdash;you care?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Of course I care," cried Peace warmly. "Poor little Benny! He
is little, ain't he? He sounds little. Can't you have him cured?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, if there was any money to pay the bills. But so far,
it has taken every cent I could earn to keep us in food and clothes.
I had hoped my book would be successful and that the royalties
would be enough to take care of us, so the short story money could
pay for an operation. But now I can never finish the book."</p>

<p>"Can't you get a typewriter? You could use one of those, couldn't
you? Grandpa has one for his work at home, and he thumps it with
only one finger on each hand."</p>

<p>"Do you know how much a typewriter costs?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No. Very much?"</p>

<p>"More than I could ever spend for one."</p>

<p>"And there's no one else to help?"</p>

<p>"No one. My father is dead. Benny's mother,&mdash;my sister,&mdash;is dead.
Her husband is a drunken sot. We turned him out long ago. It was
he who crippled Benny. Poor little Benny! He's only three, and
he will never have a chance with the other boys and girls."</p>

<p>"I've got five dollars," Peace shyly confided. "It's all my own
to do as I please with. I want you to take it. Will it buy a typewriter?"</p>

<p>"O, my, no! They cost heaps of money,&mdash;a hundred dollars for
a brand new one of the kind I want. But&mdash;but it's real dear of
you to offer me your money. I can't take it, child. I'm not a
beggar."</p>

<p>"We weren't beggars in Parker, either; but it came in mighty
handy sometimes to have folks give us things. Course we always
tried to <em>earn</em> them if we could, and if you want to <em>earn</em>
this money, you might write me five dollars' worth of stories.
Oh, I forgot!" She glanced hastily at the crippled hands, then
averted her eyes. "Truly I did. But you needn't be snippy about
my money. I know what 'tis to be poor."</p>

<p>"You! Why, your grandfather is President of the State University,
Miss Pierson says."</p>

<p>"That's my make-believe grandfather. My truly real one has been
dead for ages. Then papa died, and fin'ly mother, which left us
to dig for ourselves. We were worse off than you, 'cause there
were six of us and not one knew how to write stories for money.
I guess we'd all have starved to death or gone to the poor farm
if Grandpa hadn't come along just about that time." Before Peace
was aware of it, she had poured out the whole history of the little
brown house in Parker, while the other crippled girl listened
spellbound.</p>

<p>"What a plot for a book!" she sighed ecstatically when the narrator
had finished. "And what a picture for one of the characters!"
She fell to studying Peace with a new interest in her heart.</p>

<p>"O, do you mean to write us up in a book?" cried Peace, fascinated
with the idea. "That's what Gail has always threatened to do,
but I don't expect she ever really will. Wouldn't it be splendid
to have a story written all about ourselves? What shall you call
it? Will you let me know when it is done so I can read it and
see what kind of stuff you write?"</p>

<p>But a shadow had fallen across her companion's face, so bright
and animated a moment before, and again she glanced involuntarily
at the bandaged hands which both in their eagerness had forgotten.
But before either could speak, there was a rustling sound of stiffly
starched skirts behind them, and Miss Keith, from the floor below,
stepped around the corner.</p>

<p>"Why, Peace Greenfield!" she exclaimed at sight of them. "What
a start you gave us! Don't you know you must never leave your
own floor without permission? If the elevator boy hadn't put us
wise, we probably would be phoning to the police by this time.
Come downstairs now. Your sister is waiting for you in your room."</p>

<p>So Peace departed, but not until she trundled through the doorway
of her room did she remember that the stranger had not told her
name.</p>

<p>"O, dear," she greeted Gail. "I do show the least sense of anyone
I know."</p>

<p>"What seems to be the matter?" asked the big sister, amused at
the look of disgust on the small, thin face.</p>

<p>"I've just been gabbing with a real author lady, who has burned
her hands 'most off, so she can't write any more, and I forgot
to ask her name."</p>

<p>"Why, what are you talking about?" inquired Gail, amazed at the
unexpected answer.</p>

<p>"The author lady I just found crying in a corner upstairs because
she can't write stories any more. That's the way she's been earning
the bread and butter for her family, and she don't know what will
happen to them now. I thought maybe a typewriter would do the
work, but she says it costs a hundred dollars to buy the kind
she wants, and she wouldn't take my five. There's a baby boy,
too, who can never walk unless there is an operation and of course
it takes slathers of money for that."</p>

<p>"Whose baby boy are you interested in now?" asked a deep bass
voice from the doorway, and Peace whirled about to confront young
Dr. Shumway just entering the room.</p>

<p>"His name is Benny, and he b'longs to the little author lady
upstairs who got burned 'most to death trying to put out the lamp
which he tipped over. His mother is dead, and the little author
lady has to take care of him and her own mother. I plumb forgot
to ask what her name is, but I 'member now that she called her
nurse Miss Piercing."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Dr. Shumway seemed more enlightened with that scrap of
information than with all the rest of the story, and he stood
stroking his chin thoughtfully, as he gazed absently at Gail seated
by the window.</p>

<p>"Do you know her?" asked the small patient when he made no further
comment.</p>

<p>"I know whom you mean," he answered slowly. "But she is not my
patient. Dr. Rosencrans has that case. Where did <em>you</em>
find out about her?"</p>

<p>Peace again recounted the history of her recent adventure, and
the story lost nothing in its telling, for the child was profoundly
impressed, and she had the knack of making her listeners feel
with her.</p>

<p>"I recall now," he said, turning to Gail when the tale was ended,
"there was some talk of amputating the hands at first,&mdash;they were
so dreadfully burned,&mdash;but the little lady would not permit it.
She has suffered tortures with them, but I understand that they
are healing nicely now, though they will probably always be crippled,
and many months must elapse before she can use them again. She
is a game little woman, but very close-mouthed,&mdash;almost morose.
She seemed simply overwhelmed by her catastrophe and none of the
staff could get anything out of her." He glanced significantly
down at Peace, but she was apparently unconscious of what she
had accomplished, and the conversation turned to other channels.</p>

<p>There was a very homesick little girl in one of the rooms across
the hallway, who had done nothing but cry since the ambulance
had brought her to the hospital, and the doctor wanted Peace to
make her a little visit. So for the next few days the brown-haired
elf was so absorbed in this new task of cheering unhappy Gertrude
that she had little time to think of the author lady on the floor
above; and Gail was not prepared for the tragic face that greeted
her when she made her usual call at Peace's room one day about
a week later.</p>

<p>"Why, what has happened?" demanded the older sister, glancing
about her in alarm.</p>

<p>"Miss Wayne's gone away without ever saying good-bye to me,"
gulped the child in grieved accents. "Her patient with the <em>fractious</em>
hip died and she had a case somewhere in the country which she
had to go to, but she never told me a word about it. I didn't
think she was that kind. I liked her so much, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Peace," interrupted Gail tenderly, "she came to say good-bye
last evening and you were asleep. I had gone home and there was
no time to write a note as she had planned to do, so she told
Dick&mdash;er, I mean Dr. Shumway. But he forgot to deliver the message
this morning when he came in to see you, and just now met me with
the request that I tell you, with his apologies. Miss Wayne will
be back here at the hospital before you go home undoubtedly, for
she is a very popular nurse, not only with her patients, but with
the doctors who send their cases here for treatment. So you mustn't
fret. She did not forget,&mdash;she never can,&mdash;for I am sure she loves
you dearly, and if you had been awake she would have said good-bye
in person."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad of that," said Peace, much mollified at the explanation.
"But anyway, my author lady is gone, and I don't even know her
name."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Gail brightly, "the little author lady has gone
home, but Benny is here."</p>

<p>"Benny?"</p>

<p>"The crippled baby she told you about. Surely you remember."</p>

<p>"Course I remember. But how did he get here when there wasn't
any money?"</p>

<p>"Dic &mdash;Dr. Shumway investigated the case, and found it was
even more pitiful than the little author lady had pictured it;
so he persuaded them to let him operate on the baby for nothing,
and he <em>thinks</em> Benny's little crooked back can be made
entirely well. He left some medicine for the poor, patient invalid
mother, and she is going to get better, too. Isn't it all lovely?"</p>

<p>Peace's brown eyes were shining like stars, but all she said
was, "What did he do with the author lady?"</p>

<p>"O, that came out beautifully, too. Dick&mdash;er, Dr. Shumway told
Dr. Rosencrans her story in the office downstairs, and it happened
there was a real rich author lady there waiting for her automobile
to come and take her home. Her name is Mrs. Selwyn, and she has
been very sick, too, and must not try to write any more for a
long time yet. But she became so interested in this poor little
Miss Garland, that she insisted upon having her taken to her big,
beautiful house for a few weeks. Mrs. Selwyn employs a secretary
to do much of her typewriting, and this secretary is now to help
Miss Garland get her book finished, so it can go to the publishers
as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Is Miss Garland <em>my</em> author lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Then she won't need a typewriter herself now."</p>

<p>"O, yes, for this arrangement is only for a little while,&mdash;until
Mrs. Selwyn is well again. So some of us, &mdash;Dr. Rosencrans,
Dr. Race, Dr. Shumway, Dr. Crandall, Miss Pierson, Miss Wayne,
and oh, a whole bunch of nurses and friends, got up a collection
and bought her a splendid new machine like she wanted, and when
she goes home she will find it waiting for her."</p>

<p>"Doesn't she know?"</p>

<p>"Not a whisper. It's always to be a secret who gave it to her.
We feared that she might feel as if we thought she had been begging,
if she knew the names of the senders,&mdash;she is so extremely sensitive.
So we just tied a card to the case, and wrote on it, 'From your
loving friends.'"</p>

<p>"That's reg'lar splendid, and I want my five dollars to help
pay for it, too."</p>

<p>"But, Peace,&mdash;" Gail began.</p>

<p>"There ain't any 'but' to it," declared the small sister with
determination. "I was the one who found her, and I mean to help."</p>

<p>"Very well," sighed Gail, studying the stubborn little chin and
knowing that Peace would gain her point in some way, even if denied
the privilege of contributing her one gold piece. "You surely
did set the ball rolling, for Mrs. Selwyn says your little author
lady will make her mark in the world before many years."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess she will make a mark on the world, too," Peace
agreed complacently, "for now Benny's going to be like other children,
and the mother won't be so sick any more. Doesn't <em>everything</em>
end just splendid?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my darling," whispered Gail to herself, "when you are around."</p>
