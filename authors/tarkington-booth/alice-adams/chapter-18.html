<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>That was a thought almost continuously in his mind, even when
he was hardest at work; and, as the days went on and he could
not free himself, he became querulous about it. "I guess I'm the
biggest dang fool alive,"  he told his wife as they sat together
one evening. "I got plenty else to bother me, without worrying
my head off about what HE thinks. I can't help what he thinks;
it's too late for that. So why should I keep pestering myself
about it?"</p>

<p>"It'll wear off, Virgil," Mrs. Adams said, reassuringly. She
was gentle and sympathetic with him, and for the first time in
many years he would come to sit with her and talk, when he had
finished his day's work. He had told her, evading her eye, "Oh,
I don't blame you. You didn't get after me to do this on your
own account; you couldn't help it."</p>

<p>"Yes; but it don't wear off," he complained. "This afternoon
I was showing the men how I wanted my vats to go, and I caught
my fool self standing there saying to my fool self, 'It's funny
I don't hear how he feels about it from SOMEbody.' I was saying
it aloud, almost&mdash;and it IS funny I don't hear anything!"</p>

<p>"Well, you see what it means, don't you, Virgil? It only means
he hasn't said anything to anybody about it. Don't you think you're
getting kind of morbid over it?"</p>

<p>"Maybe, maybe," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," she said, briskly. "You don't realize what a little
bit of a thing all this is to him. It's been a long, long while
since the last time you even mentioned glue to him, and he's probably
forgotten everything about it."</p>

<p>"You're off your base; it isn't like him to forget things," Adams
returned, peevishly. "He may seem to forget 'em, but he don't."</p>

<p>"But he's not thinking about this, or you'd have heard from him
before now."</p>

<p>Her husband shook his head. "Ah, that's just it!" he said. "Why
<em>HAVEN'T I </em>heard from him?"</p>

<p>"It's all your morbidness, Virgil. Look at Walter: if Mr. Lamb
held this up against you, would he still let Walter stay there?
Wouldn't he have discharged Walter if he felt angry with you?"</p>

<p>"That dang boy!" Adams said. "If he <em>WANTED </em>to come with
me now, I wouldn't hardly let him, What do you suppose makes him
so bull-headed?"</p>

<p>"But hasn't he a right to choose for himself?" she asked. "I
suppose he feels he ought to stick to what he thinks is sure pay.
As soon as he sees that you're going to succeed with the glue-works
he'll want to be with you quick enough."</p>

<p>"Well, he better get a little sense in his head," Adams returned,
crossly. "He wanted me to pay him a three-hundred-dollar bonus
in advance, when anybody with a grain of common sense knows I
need every penny I can lay my hands on!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said. "He'll come around later and be glad
of the chance."</p>

<p>"He'll have to beg for it then! <em>I</em> won't ask him again."</p>

<p>"Oh, Walter will come out all right; you needn't worry. And don't
you see that Mr. Lamb's not discharging him means there's no hard
feeling against you, Virgil?"</p>

<p>"I can't make it out at all," he said, frowning. "The only thing
I can <em>THINK </em>it means is that J. A. Lamb is so fair-minded&mdash;and
of course he IS one of the fair-mindedest men alive I suppose
that's the reason he hasn't fired Walter. He may know," Adams
concluded, morosely&mdash;"he may know that's just another thing to
make me feel all the meaner: keeping my boy there on a salary
after I've done him an injury."</p>

<p>"Now, now!" she said, trying to comfort him. "You couldn't do
anybody an injury to save your life, and everybody knows it."</p>

<p>"Well, anybody ought to know I wouldn't <em>WANT </em>to do an
injury, but this world isn't built so't we can do just what we
want." He paused, reflecting. "Of course there may be one explanation
of why Walter's still there: J. A. maybe hasn't noticed that he
IS there. There's so many I expect he hardly knows him by sight."</p>

<p>"Well, just do quit thinking about it," she urged him. "It only
bothers you without doing any good. Don't you know that?"</p>

<p>"Don't I, though!" he laughed, feebly. "I know it better'n anybody!
How funny that is: when you know thinking about a thing only pesters
you without helping anything at all, and yet you keep right on
pestering yourself with it!"</p>

<p>"But <em>WHY?" </em>she said. "What's the use when you know you
haven't done anything wrong, Virgil? You said yourself you were
going to improve the process so much it would be different from
the old one, and you'd <em>REALLY </em>have a right to it."</p>

<p>Adams had persuaded himself of this when he yielded; he had found
it necessary to persuade himself of it&mdash;though there was a part
of him, of course, that remained unpersuaded; and this discomfiting
part of him was what made his present trouble. "Yes, I know,"
he said. "That's true, but I can't quite seem to get away from
the fact that the principle of the process is a good deal the
same&mdash;well, it's more'n that; it's just about the same as the
one he hired Campbell and me to work out for him. Truth is, nobody
could tell the difference, and I don't know as there IS any difference
except in these improvements I'm making. Of course, the improvements
do give me pretty near a perfect right to it, as a person might
say; and that's one of the things I thought of putting in my letter
to him; but I was afraid he'd just think I was trying to make
up excuses, so I left it out. I kind of worried all the time I
was writing that letter, because if he thought I <em>WAS </em>just
making up excuses, why, it might set him just so much more against
me."</p>

<p>Ever since Mrs. Adams had found that she was to have her way,
the depths of her eyes had been troubled by a continuous uneasiness;
and, although she knew it was there, and sometimes veiled it by
keeping the revealing eyes averted from her husband and children,
she could not always cover it under that assumption of absent-mindedness.
The uneasy look became vivid, and her voice was slightly tremulous
now, as she said, "But what if he <em>SHOULD </em>be against you&mdash;although
I don't believe he is, of course&mdash;you told me he couldn't DO anything
to you, Virgil."</p>

<p>"No," he said, slowly. "I can't see how he could do anything.
It was just a secret, not a patent; the thing ain't patentable.
I've tried to think what he could do&mdash;supposing he was to want
to&mdash;but I can't figure out anything at all that would be any harm
to me. There isn't any way in the world it could be made a question
of law. Only thing he could do'd be to <em>TELL </em>people his
side of it, and set 'em against me. I been kind of waiting for
that to happen, all along."</p>

<p>She looked somewhat relieved. "So did I expect it," she said.
"I was dreading it most on Alice's account: it might have&mdash;well,
young men are so easily influenced and all. But so far as the
business is concerned, what if Mr. Lamb did talk? That wouldn't
amount to much. It wouldn't affect the business; not to hurt.
And, besides, he isn't even doing that."</p>

<p>"No; anyhow not yet, it seems." And Adams sighed again, wistfully.
"But I <em>WOULD </em>give a good deal to know what he thinks!"</p>

<p>Before his surrender he had always supposed that if he did such
an unthinkable thing as to seize upon the glue process for himself,
what he would feel must be an overpowering shame. But shame is
the rarest thing in the world: what he felt was this unremittent
curiosity about his old employer's thoughts. It was an obsession,
yet he did not want to hear what Lamb "thought" from Lamb himself,
for Adams had a second obsession, and this was his dread of meeting
the old man face to face. Such an encounter could happen only
by chance and unexpectedly; since Adams would have avoided any
deliberate meeting, so long as his legs had strength to carry
him, even if Lamb came to the house to see him.</p>

<p>But people do meet unexpectedly; and when Adams had to be down-town
he kept away from the "wholesale district." One day he did see
Lamb, as the latter went by in his car, impassive, going home
to lunch; and Adams, in the crowd at a corner, knew that the old
man had not seen him. Nevertheless, in a street car, on the way
back to his sheds, an hour later, he was still subject to little
shivering seizures of horror.</p>

<p>He worked unceasingly, seeming to keep at it even in his sleep,
for he always woke in the midst of a planning and estimating that
must have been going on in his mind before consciousness of himself
returned. Moreover, the work, thus urged, went rapidly, in spite
of the high wages he had to pay his labourers for their short
hours. "It eats money," he complained, and, in fact, by the time
his vats and boilers were in place it had eaten almost all he
could supply; but in addition to his equipment he now owned a
stock of "raw material," raw indeed; and when operations should
be a little further along he was confident his banker would be
willing to "carry" him.</p>

<p>Six weeks from the day he had obtained his lease he began his
glue-making. The terrible smells came out of the sheds and went
writhing like snakes all through that quarter of the town. A smiling
man, strolling and breathing the air with satisfaction, would
turn a corner and smile no more, but hurry. However, coloured
people had almost all the dwellings of this old section to themselves;
and although even they were troubled, there was recompense for
them. Being philosophic about what appeared to them as in the
order of nature, they sought neither escape nor redress, and soon
learned to bear what the wind brought them. They even made use
of it to enrich those figures of speech with which the native
impulses of coloured people decorate their communications: they
flavoured metaphor, simile, and invective with it; and thus may
be said to have enjoyed it. But the man who produced it took a
hot bath as soon as he reached his home the evening of that first
day when his manufacturing began. Then he put on fresh clothes;
but after dinner he seemed to be haunted, and asked his wife if
she "noticed anything."</p>

<p>She laughed and inquired what he meant.</p>

<p>"Seems to me as if that glue-works smell hadn't quit hanging
to me," he explained. "Don't you notice it?"</p>

<p>"No! What an idea!"</p>

<p>He laughed, too, but uneasily; and told her he was sure "the
dang glue smell" was somehow sticking to him. Later, he went outdoors
and walked up and down the small yard in the dusk; but now and
then he stood still, with his head lifted, and sniffed the air
suspiciously. "Can <em>YOU </em>smell it?" he called to Alice,
who sat upon the veranda, prettily dressed and waiting in a reverie.</p>

<p>"Smell what, papa?"</p>

<p>"That dang glue-works."</p>

<p>She did the same thing her mother had done: laughed, and said,
"No! How foolish! Why, papa, it's over two miles from here!"</p>

<p>"You don't get it at all?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"The idea! The air is lovely to-night, papa."</p>

<p>The air did not seem lovely to him, for he was positive that
he detected the taint. He wondered how far it carried, and if
J. A. Lamb would smell it, too, out on his own lawn a mile to
the north; and if he did, would he guess what it was? Then Adams
laughed at himself for such nonsense; but could not rid his nostrils
of their disgust. To him the whole town seemed to smell of his
glue-works.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the glue was making, and his sheds were busy. "Guess
we're stirrin' up this ole neighbourhood with more than the smell,"
his foreman remarked one morning.</p>

<p>"How's that?" Adams inquired.</p>

<p>"That great big, enormous ole dead butterine factory across the
street from our lot," the man said. "Nothin' like settin' an example
to bring real estate to life. That place is full o' carpenters
startin' in to make a regular buildin' of it again. Guess you
ought to have the credit of it, because you was the first man
in ten years to see any possibilities in this neighbourhood."</p>

<p>Adams was pleased, and, going out to see for himself, heard a
great hammering and sawing from within the building; while carpenters
were just emerging gingerly upon the dangerous roof. He walked
out over the dried mud of his deep lot, crossed the street, and
spoke genially to a workman who was removing the broken glass
of a window on the ground floor.</p>

<p>"Here! What's all this howdy-do over here?"</p>

<p>"Goin' to fix her all up, I guess," the workman said. "Big job
it is, too."</p>

<p>"Sh' think it would be."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; a pretty big job&mdash;a pretty big job. Got men at it
on all four floors and on the roof. They're doin' it <em>RIGHT</em>."</p>

<p>"Who's doing it?"</p>

<p>"Lord! I d' know. Some o' these here big manufacturing corporations,
I guess."</p>

<p>"What's it going to be?"</p>

<p>"They tell ME," the workman answered&mdash;"they tell ME she's goin'
to be a butterine factory again. Anyways, I hope she won't be
anything to smell like that glue-works you got over there not
while I'm workin' around her, anyways!"</p>

<p>"That smell's all right," Adams said. "You soon get used to it."</p>

<p>"You do?" The man appeared incredulous. "Listen! I was over in
France: it's a good thing them Dutchmen never thought of it; we'd
of had to quit!"</p>

<p>Adams laughed, and went back to his sheds. "I guess my foreman
was right," he told his wife, that evening, with a little satisfaction.
"As soon as one man shows enterprise enough to found an industry
in a broken-down neighbourhood, somebody else is sure to follow.
I kind of like the look of it: it'll help make our place seem
sort of more busy and prosperous when it comes to getting a loan
from the bank&mdash;and I got to get one mighty soon, too. I did think
some that if things go as well as there's every reason to think
they <em>OUGHT </em>to, I might want to spread out and maybe get
hold of that old factory myself; but I hardly expected to be able
to handle a proposition of that size before two or three years
from now, and anyhow there's room enough on the lot I got, if
we need more buildings some day. Things are going about as fine
as I could ask: I hired some girls to-day to do the bottling&mdash;coloured
girls along about sixteen to twenty years old. Afterwhile, I expect
to get a machine to put the stuff in the little bottles, when
we begin to get good returns; but half a dozen of these coloured
girls can do it all right now, by hand. We're getting to have
really quite a little plant over there: yes, sir, quite a regular
little plant!"</p>

<p>He chuckled, and at this cheerful sound, of a kind his wife had
almost forgotten he was capable of producing, she ventured to
put her hand upon his arm. They had gone outdoors, after dinner,
taking two chairs with them, and were sitting through the late
twilight together, keeping well away from the "front porch," which
was not yet occupied, however Alice was in her room changing her
dress.</p>

<p>"Well, honey," Mrs. Adams said, taking confidence not only to
put her hand upon his arm, but to revive this disused endearment;&mdash;"it's
grand to have you so optimistic. Maybe some time you'll admit
I was right, after all. Everything's going so well, it seems a
pity you didn't take this&mdash;this step&mdash;long ago. Don't you think
maybe so, Virgil?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if I was ever going to, I don't know but I might as well
of. I got to admit the proposition begins to look pretty good:
I know the stuff'll sell, and I can't see a thing in the world
to stop it. It does look good, and if&mdash;if&#11834;" He paused.</p>

<p>"If what?" she said, suddenly anxious.</p>

<p>He laughed plaintively, as if confessing a superstition. "It's
funny&mdash;well, it's mighty funny about that smell. I've got so used
to it at the plant I never seem to notice it at all over there.
It's only when I get away. Honestly, can't you notice&#11834;?"</p>

<p>"Virgil!" She lifted her hand to strike his arm chidingly. "Do
quit harping on that nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course it don't amount to anything," he said. "A person
can stand a good deal of just smell. It don't <em>WORRY </em>me
any."</p>

<p>"I should think not especially as there isn't any."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I feel pretty fair over the whole thing&mdash;a
lot better'n I ever expected to, anyhow. I don't know as there's
any reason I shouldn't tell you so."</p>

<p>She was deeply pleased with this acknowledgment, and her voice
had tenderness in it as she responded: "There, honey! Didn't I
always say you'd be glad if you did it?"</p>

<p>Embarrassed, he coughed loudly, then filled his pipe and lit
it. "Well,"  he said, slowly, "it's a puzzle. Yes, sir, it's a
puzzle."</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"Pretty much everything, I guess."</p>

<p>As he spoke, a song came to them from a lighted window over their
heads. Then the window darkened abruptly, but the song continued
as Alice went down through the house to wait on the little veranda.
"Mi chiamo Mimi,"  she sang, and in her voice throbbed something
almost startling in its sweetness. Her father and mother listened,
not speaking until the song stopped with the click of the wire
screen at the front door as Alice came out.</p>

<p>"My!" said her father. "How sweet she does sing! I don't know
as I ever heard her voice sound nicer than it did just then."</p>

<p>"There's something that makes it sound that way," his wife told
him.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," he said, sighing. "I suppose so. You think&#11834;"</p>

<p>"She's just terribly in love with him!"</p>

<p>"I expect that's the way it ought to be," he said, then drew
upon his pipe for reflection, and became murmurous with the symptoms
of melancholy laughter. "It don't make things less of a puzzle,
though, does it?"</p>

<p>"In what way, Virgil?"</p>

<p>"Why, here," he said&mdash;"here we go through all this muck and moil
to help fix things nicer for her at home, and what's it all amount
to? Seems like she's just gone ahead the way she'd 'a' gone anyhow;
and now, I suppose, getting ready to up and leave us! Ain't that
a puzzle to you? It is to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, but things haven't gone that far yet."</p>

<p>"Why, you just said&#11834;"</p>

<p>She gave a little cry of protest. "Oh, they aren't <em>ENGAGED
</em>yet. Of course they <em>WILL </em>be; he's just as much interested
in her as she is in him, but&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, what's the trouble then?"</p>

<p>"You <em>ARE </em>a simple old fellow!" his wife exclaimed, and
then rose from her chair. "That reminds me," she said.</p>

<p>"What of?" he asked. "What's my being simple remind you of?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" she laughed. "It wasn't you that reminded me. It was
just something that's been on my mind. I don't believe he's actually
ever been inside our house!"</p>

<p>"Hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"I actually don't believe he ever has," she said. "Of course
we must&#11834;" She paused, debating.</p>

<p>"We must what?"</p>

<p>"I guess I better talk to Alice about it right now," she said.
"He don't usually come for about half an hour yet; I guess I've
got time." And with that she walked away, leaving him to his puzzles.</p>
