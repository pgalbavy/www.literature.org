<p>Kate was soon fond of the limping, untidy Juana, and of the girls.
Concha was fourteen, a thick, heavy, barbaric girl with a mass of
black waving hair which she was always scratching.  Maria was
eleven, a shy, thin bird-like thing with big eyes that seemed
almost to absorb the light round her.</p>

<p>It was a reckless family.  Juana admitted a different father for
Jes&uacute;s, but to judge from the rest, one would have suspected a
different father for each of them.  There was a basic, sardonic
carelessness in the face of life, in all the family.  They lived
from day to day, a stubborn, heavy, obstinate life of indifference,
careless about the past, careless about the present, careless about
the future.  They had even no interest in money.  Whatever they got
they spent in a minute, and forgot it again.</p>

<p>Without aim or purpose, they lived absolutely &agrave; terre, down on the
dark, volcanic earth.  They were not animals, because men and women
and their children CANNOT be animals.  It is not granted us.  Go,
for once gone, thou never canst return! says the great Urge, which
drives us creatively on.  When man tries brutally to return to the
older, previous levels of evolution, he does so in the spirit of
cruelty and misery.</p>

<p>So in the black eyes of the family, a certain vicious fear and
wonder and misery.  The misery of human beings who squat helpless
outside their own unbuilt selves, unable to win their souls out of
the chaos, and indifferent to all other victories.</p>

<p>White people are becoming soulless too.  But they have conquered
the lower worlds of metal and energy, so they whizz around in
machines, circling the void of their own emptiness.</p>

<p>To Kate, there was a great pathos in her family.  Also a certain
repulsiveness.</p>

<p>Juana and her children, once they accepted their Ni&ntilde;a as their own,
were honest with intensity.  Point of honour, they were honest to
the least little plum in the fruit bowl.  And almost intensely
eager to serve.</p>

<p>Themselves indifferent to their surroundings, they would live in
squalor.  The earth was the great garbage-bowl.  Everything
discarded was flung on the earth and they did not care.  Almost
they liked to live in a milieu of fleas and old rags, bits of
paper, banana skins and mango stones.  Here's a piece torn off my
dress!  Earth, take it.  Here's the combings of my hair!  Earth,
take them!</p>

<p>But Kate could not bear it.  She cared.  And immediately, the
family were quite glad, thrilled that SHE cared.  They swept the
patio with the twig broom till they swept the very surface of the
earth away.  Fun!  The Ni&ntilde;a had feelings about it.</p>

<p>She was a source of wonder and amusement to them.  But she was
never a class superior.  She was a half-incomprehensible, half-
amusing wonder-being.</p>

<p>The Ni&ntilde;a wanted the aguador to bring two botes of hot water, quick,
from the hot springs, to wash herself all over every morning.  Fun!
Go, Maria, tell the aguador to RUN with the Ni&ntilde;a's water.</p>

<p>Then they almost resented it that she shut herself off to have her
bath.  She was a sort of goddess to them, to provide them with fun
and wonder; but she ought always to be accessible.  And a god who
is forever accessible to human beings has an unenviable time of it,
Kate soon discovered.</p>

<p>No, it was no sinecure, being a Ni&ntilde;a.  At dawn began the scrape-
scrape of the twig broom outside.  Kate stayed on in bed, doors
fastened but shutters open.  Flutter outside!  Somebody wanted to
sell two eggs.  Where is the Ni&ntilde;a?  She is sleeping!  The visitor
does not go.  Continual flutter outside.</p>

<p>The aguador!  Ah, the water for the Ni&ntilde;a's bath!  She is sleeping,
she is sleeping.'  No!' called Kate, slipping into a dressing-gown
and unbolting the door.  In come the children with the bath-tub, in
comes the aguador with the two square kerosene cans full of hot
water.  Twelve centavos!  Twelve centavos for the aguador!  No hay!
We haven't got twelve centavos.  Later!  Later!  Away trots the
aguador, pole over his shoulder.  Kate shuts her doors and shutters
and starts her bath.</p>

<p>'Ni&ntilde;a?  Ni&ntilde;a?'</p>

<p>'What do you want?'</p>

<p>'Eggs boiled or fried or rancheros?  Which do you want?'</p>

<p>'Boiled.'</p>

<p>'Coffee or chocolate?'</p>

<p>'Coffee.'</p>

<p>'Or do you want tea?'</p>

<p>'No, coffee.'</p>

<p>Bath proceeds.</p>

<p>'Nina?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'There is no coffee.  We are going to buy some.'</p>

<p>'I'll take tea.'</p>

<p>'No, Ni&ntilde;a!  I am going.  Wait for me.'</p>

<p>'Go then.'</p>

<p>Kate comes out to breakfast on the veranda.  The table is set,
heaped with fruit and white bread and sweet buns.</p>

<p>'Good morning, Ni&ntilde;a.  How have you passed the night?  Well!  Ah,
praised be God!  Maria, the coffee.  I'm going to put the eggs in
the water.  Oh, Ni&ntilde;a, that they may not be boiled hard! - Look, what
feet of the Madonna!  Look!  Bonitos!'</p>

<p>And Juana stooped down, fascinated to touch with her black finger
Kate's white soft feet, that were thrust in light sandals, just a
thong across the foot.</p>

<p>The day had begun.  Juana looked upon herself as dedicated entirely
to Kate.  As soon as possible she shooed her girls away, to school.
Sometimes they went: mostly they didn't.  The Ni&ntilde;a said they must
go to school.  Listen!  Listen now!  Says the Ni&ntilde;a that you must go
to school!  Away!  Walk!</p>

<p>Juana would limp back and forth down the long veranda from kitchen
to the breakfast table, carrying away the dishes one by one.  Then,
with a great splash, she was washing up.</p>

<p>Morning!  Brilliant sun pouring into the patio, on the hibiscus
flowers and the fluttering yellow and green rags of the banana-
trees.  Birds swiftly coming and going, with tropical suddenness.
In the dense shadow of the mango-grove, white-clad Indians going
like ghosts.  The sense of fierce sun and, almost more impressive,
of dark, intense shadow.  A twitter of life, yet a certain heavy
weight of silence.  A dazzling flicker and brilliance of light, yet
the feeling of weight.</p>

<p>Kate would sit alone, rocking on her veranda, pretending to sew.
Silently appears an old man with one egg held up mysteriously, like
some symbol.  Would the patrona buy it for five centavos?  La Juana
only gives four centavos.  All right.  Where is Juana?</p>

<p>Juana appears from the plaza with more purchases.  The egg!  The
four centavos!  The account of the spendings.  Entonces!  Entonces!
Luego!  Luego!  Ah, Ni&ntilde;a, no tengo memoria!  Juana could not read
nor write.  She scuffled off to the market with her pesos, bought
endless little things at one or two centavos each, every morning.
And every morning there was a reckoning up.  Ah!  Ah!  Where are
we?  I have no memory.  Well then - ah - yes - I bought ocote for
three centavos!  How much?  How much, Ni&ntilde;a?  How much is it now?</p>

<p>It was a game which thrilled Juana to the marrow, reckoning up the
centavos to get it just right.  If she was a centavo short in the
change, she was paralysed.  Time after time she would reappear.
There is a centavo short, Ni&ntilde;a!  Ah, how stupid I am!  But I will
give you one of mine!</p>

<p>'Don't bother,' said Kate.  'Don't think of it any more.'</p>

<p>'But yes.  But yes!' and away she limped in distraction.</p>

<p>Till an hour later, loud cry from the far end of the house.  Juana
waving a scrap of greenery.</p>

<p>'Mire!  Ni&ntilde;a!  Compr&eacute; perejil a un centavo - I bought parsley for
one cent.  Is it right?'</p>

<p>'It is right,' said Kate.</p>

<p>And life could proceed once more.</p>

<p>There were two kitchens, the one next the dining-room, belonging to
Kate, and the narrow little shed under the banana-trees, belonging
to the servants.  From her veranda Kate looked away down to Juana's
kitchen shed.  It had a black window-hole.</p>

<p>Clap!  Clap!  Clap!  Clap!  Why, I thought Concha was at school!
said Kate to herself.</p>

<p>No! - there, in the darkness of the window-hole, was Concha's
swarthy face and mane, peering out like some animal from a cave, as
she made the tortillas.  Tortillas are flat pancakes of maize
dough, baked dry on a flat earthenware plate over the fire.  And
the making consists of clapping a bit of new dough from the palm of
one hand to the other, till the tortilla is of the requisite
thinness, roundness, and so-called lightness.</p>

<p>Clap!  Clap!  Clap!  Clap!  Clap!  Clap!  Clap!  It was as
inevitable as the tick of some spider, the sound of Concha making
tortillas in the heat of the morning, peering out of her dark
window-hole.  And some time after mid-day, the smoke would be
coming out of the window-hole; Concha was throwing the raw
tortillas on the big earthen plate over the slow wood fire.</p>

<p>Then Ezequiel might or might not stride in, very much the man,
serape poised over one shoulder and big straw hat jauntily curled,
to eat the mid-day tortillas.  If he had work in the fields at any
distance, he would not appear till nightfall.  If he appeared, he
sat on the doorstep and the women served him his tortillas and
fetched him his drink of water as if he was a king, boy though he
might be.  And his rough, breaking voice was heard in quiet
command.</p>

<p>Command was the word.  Though he was quiet and gentle, and very
conscientious, there was calm, kingly command in his voice when he
spoke to his mother or sisters.  The old male prerogative.
Somehow, it made Kate want to ridicule him.</p>

<p>Came her own meal: one of her trials.  Hot, rather greasy soup.
Inevitable hot, greasy, rather peppery rice.  Inevitable meat in
hot, thick, rather greasy sauce.  Boiled calabacitas or egg-plant,
salad, perhaps some dulce made with milk - and the big basket of
fruit.  Overhead, the blazing tropical sun of late May.</p>

<p>Afternoon, and greater heat.  Juana set off with the girls and the
dishes.  They would do the washing up in the lake.  Squatting on
the stones, they would dabble the plates one by one, the spoons and
the forks one by one in the filmy water of the lake, then put them
in the sun to dry.  After which Juana might wash a couple of towels
in the lake and the girls might bathe.  Sauntering the day away - 
sauntering the day away.</p>

<p>Jes&uacute;s, the eldest son, a queer, heavy, greasy fellow, usually
appeared in the afternoon, to water the garden.  But he ate his
meals at the hotel, and really lived there, had his home there.
Not that he had any home, any more than a zopilote had a home.  But
he ran the planta, and did odd jobs about the hotel, and worked
every day in the year till half-past ten at night, earning twenty-
two pesos, eleven dollars, a month.  He wore a black shirt, and his
thick, massive black hair dropped over his low brow.  Very near to
an animal.  And though, to order, he wore a black Fascisti shirt,
he had the queer, animal jeering of the socialists, an instinct for
pulling things down.</p>

<p>His mother and he had a funny little intimacy of quiet and
indifferent mutual taunting of one another.  He would give her some
money if she were in a strait.  And there was a thin little thread
of blood-bondage between them.  Apart from that, complete
indifference.</p>

<p>Ezequiel was a finer type.  He was slender and so erect that he
almost curved backwards.  He was very shy, farouche.  Proud also,
and more responsible to his family.  He would not go to work in an
hotel.  No.  He was a worker in the fields, and he was proud of it.
A man's work.  No equivocal sort of half-service for him.</p>

<p>Though he was just a hired labourer, yet working on the land he
never felt he was working for a master.  It was the land he worked
for.  Somewhere inside himself he felt that the land was his, and
he belonged in a measure to it.  Perhaps a lingering feeling of
tribal, communal land-ownership and service.</p>

<p>When there was work, he was due to earn a peso a day.  There was
often no work: and often only seventy-five centavos a day for wage.
When the land was dry, he would try to get work on the road, though
this he did not like.  But he earned his peso a day.</p>

<p>Often, there was no work.  Often, for days, sometimes for weeks, he
would have to hang about, nothing to do, nothing to do.  Only, when
the Socialist Government had begun giving the peasants bits of
land, dividing up the big haciendas, Ezequiel had been allotted a
little piece outside the village.  He would go and gather the
stones together there, and prepare to build a little hut.  And he
would break the earth with a hoe, his only implement, as far as
possible.  But he had no blood connection with this square
allotment of unnatural earth, and he could not get himself into
relations with it.  He was fitful and diffident about it.  There
was no incentive, no urge.</p>

<p>On workdays he would come striding in about six o'clock, shyly
greeting Kate as he passed.  He was a gentleman in his barbarism.
Then, away in the far recess, he would rapidly fold tortilla after
tortilla, sitting on the floor with his back to the wall, rapidly
eating the leathery things that taste of mortar, because the maize
is first boiled with lime to loosen the husk, and accepting another
little pile, served on a leaf, from the cook, Concha.  Juana, cook
for the Ni&ntilde;a, would no longer condescend to cook for her own
family.  And sometimes there was a mess of meat and chile for
Ezequiel to scoop up out of the earthenware casserole, with his
tortillas.  And sometimes there was not.  But always, he ate with a
certain blind, rapid indifference, that also seems to be Mexican.
They seem to EAT even with a certain hostile reluctance, and have a
strange indifference to what or when they eat.</p>

<p>His supper finished, as a rule he was off again like a shot, to the
plaza, to be among men.  And the women would sit desultorily about,
on the ground.  Sometimes Kate would come in at nine o'clock to an
empty place - Ezequiel in the plaza, Juana and Maria disappeared
somewhere or other, and Choncha lying asleep like a heap of rags on
the gravel of the patio.  When Kate called her, she would raise her
head, stupefied and hopeless; then get up like a dog and crawl away
to the gate.  The strange stupor of boredom and hopelessness that
was always sinking upon them would make Kate's heart stand still
with dread.</p>

<p>The peculiar indifference to everything, even to one another.
Juana washed a cotton shirt and a pair of cotton trousers for each
of her sons, once a week, and there her maternal efforts ended.
She saw hardly anything of them, and was often completely unaware
of what Ezequiel was doing, where he was working, or at what.  He
had just gone off to work, no more.</p>

<p>Yet again, sometimes she had hot, fierce pangs of maternal
protectiveness, when the boy was unjustly treated, as he often was.
And if she thought he were ill, a black sort of fatalistic fear
came over her.  But Kate had to rouse her into getting some simple
medicine.</p>

<p>Like animals, yet not at all like animals.  For animals are
complete in their isolation and their insouciance.  With them it is
not indifference.  It is completeness in themselves.  But with the
family there was always a kind of bleeding of incompleteness, a
terrible stupor of boredom settling down.</p>

<p>The two girls could not be apart: they must always be running after
one another.  Yet Concha continually teased the big-eyed, na&iuml;ve
simpleton of a Maria.  And Maria was always in tears.  Or the two
were suddenly throwing stones at one another.  But with no real aim
to hit.  And Juana was abusing them with sudden vehemence, that
flickered in a minute to complete indifference again.</p>

<p>Queer, the savage ferocity with which the girls would suddenly be
throwing stones at one another.  But queerer still, they always
aimed JUST TO MISS, Kate noticed the same in the savage attacks the
boys made on one another, on the beach; hurling large stones with
intense, terrible ferocity.  But almost always, aiming with a
curious cast in the eyes, just to miss.</p>

<p>But sometimes not.  Sometimes hitting with a sharp cut.  And then
the wounded one would drop right down, with a howl, as if dead.
And the other boys would edge away, in a silent kind of dread.  And
the wounded boy would be prostrate, not really much hurt, but as if
he was killed.</p>

<p>Then, maybe, suddenly he would be up, with a convulsion of murder
in his face, pursuing his adversary with a stone.  And the
adversary would abjectly flee.</p>

<p>Always the same thing among the young: a ceaseless, endless
taunting and tormenting.  The same as among the Red Indians.  But
the Pueblo Indians rarely lapsing from speech into violence.  The
Mexican boys almost always.  And almost always, one boy in
murderous rage, pursuing his taunter till he had hurt him: then an
abject collapse of the one hurt.  Then, usually, a revival of the
one hurt, the murderous frenzy transferred to him, and the first
attacker fleeing abjectly, in terror.  One or the other always
abject.</p>

<p>They were a strange puzzle to Kate.  She felt something must be
done.  She herself was inspired to help.  So she had the two girls
for an hour a day, teaching them to read, to sew, to draw.  Maria
wanted to learn to read: that she did want.  For the rest, they
began well.  But soon, the regularity and the slight insistence of
Kate on their attention made them take again that peculiar
invisible jeering tone, something peculiar to the American
Continent.  A quiet, invisible, malevolent mockery, a desire to
wound.  They would press upon her, trespassing upon her privacy,
and with a queer effrontery, doing all they could to walk over her.
With their ugly little wills, trying to pull her will down.</p>

<p>'No, don't lean on me, Concha.  Stand on your own feet.'</p>

<p>The slight grin of malevolence on Concha's face, as she stood on
her own feet.  Then:</p>

<p>'Do you have lice in your hair, Ni&ntilde;a?'</p>

<p>The question asked with a peculiar, subtle, Indian insolence.</p>

<p>'No,' said Kate, suddenly angry.  'And now go!  Go!  Go away from
me!  Don't come near me.'</p>

<p>They slunk out, abject.  So much for educating them.</p>

<p>Kate had visitors from Guadalajara - great excitement.  But while
the visitors were drinking tea with Kate on the veranda, at the
other side of the patio, full in view, Juana, Concha, Maria and
Felipa, a cousin of about sixteen, squatted on the gravel with
their splendid black hair down their backs, displaying themselves
as they hunted in each other's hair for lice.  They wanted to be
full in view.  And they were it.  They wanted the basic fact of
lice to be thrust under the noses of those white people.</p>

<p>Kate strode down the veranda.</p>

<p>'If you must pick lice,' she said in a shaking voice to Juana,
shaking with anger, 'pick them there, in your own place, where you
can't be seen.'</p>

<p>One instant, Juana's black inchoate eyes gleamed with a malevolent
ridicule, meeting Kate's.  The next instant, humble and abject, the
four with their black hair down their backs slunk into the recess
out of sight.</p>

<p>But it pleased Juana that she had been able to make Kate's eyes
blaze with anger.  It pleased her.  She felt a certain low power in
herself.  True, she was a little afraid of that anger.  But that
was what she wanted.  She would have no use for a Ni&ntilde;a of whom she
was not a bit afraid.  And she wanted to be able to provoke that
anger, of which she felt a certain abject twinge of fear.</p>

<p>Ah the dark races!  Kate's own Irish were near enough for her to
have glimpsed some of the mystery.  The dark races belong to a
bygone cycle of humanity.  They are left behind in a gulf out of
which they have never been able to climb.  And on to the particular
white man's levels they never will be able to climb.  They can only
follow as servants.</p>

<p>While the white man keeps the impetus of his own proud, onward
march, the dark races will yield and serve, perforce.  But let the
white man once have a misgiving about his own leadership, and the
dark races will at once attack him, to pull him down into the old
gulfs.  To engulf him again.</p>

<p>Which is what is happening.  For the white man, let him bluster as
he may, is hollow with misgiving about his own supremacy.</p>

<p>Full speed ahead, then, for the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle.</p>

<p>But once Kate had been roused to a passion of revulsion from these
lice-picking, down-dragging people, they changed again, and served
her with a certain true wistfulness that could not but touch her.
Juana cared really about nothing.  But just that last thread of
relationship that connected her with Kate and the upper world of
daylight and fresh air, she didn't want to break.  No, no, she
didn't want finally to drive her Ni&ntilde;a away.  No, no, the only one
thing she did want, ultimately, was to serve her Ni&ntilde;a.</p>

<p>But at the same time, she cherished a deep malevolent grudge
against rich people, white people, superior people.  Perhaps the
white man has finally betrayed his own leadership.  Who knows!  But
it is a thing of the brave, on-marching soul, and perhaps this has
been betrayed already by the white man.  So that the dark are
rising upon him.</p>

<p>Juana would come to Kate, telling her stories from the past.
And the sinister mocking film would be on her black eyes, and her
lined copper face would take on its reptile mask as she would
continue: 'Usted sabe, Ni&ntilde;a, los gringos, los gringuitos llevan
todo - you know, Ni&ntilde;a, the gringos and the gringuitos take away
everything . . .'</p>

<p>The gringos are the Americans.  But Kate herself was included by
Juana in the gringuitos: the white foreigners.  The woman was
making another sliding, insolent attack.</p>

<p>'It is possible,' said Kate coldly.  'But tell me what I take away
from Mexico.'</p>

<p>'No, Ni&ntilde;a, no!'  The subtle smile of satisfaction lurked under the
bronze tarnish of Juana's face.  She had been able to get at the
other woman, touch the raw.  'I don't speak of you, Ni&ntilde;a!'  But
there was too much protest in it.</p>

<p>Almost, they wanted to drive her away: to insult her and drag her
down and make her want to go away.  They couldn't help it.  Like
the Irish, they could cut off their nose to spite their face.</p>

<p>The backward races!</p>

<p>At the same time there was a true pathos about them.  Ezequiel had
worked for a man for two months, building a house, when he was a
boy of fourteen, in order to get a serape.  At the end of the two
months, the man had put him off, and he had not got the serape: had
never got it.  A bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>But, then, Kate was not responsible for that.  And Juana seemed
almost to make her so.</p>

<p>A people without the energy of GETTING ON, how could they fail to
be hopelessly exploited.  They had been hopelessly and cruelly
exploited, for centuries.  And their backbones were locked in
malevolent resistance.</p>

<p>'But,' as Kate said to herself, 'I don't want to exploit them.  Not
a bit.  On the contrary, I am willing to give more than I get.  But
that nasty insinuating insultingness is not fair in the game.  I
never insult them.  I am so careful not to hurt them.  And then
they DELIBERATELY make these centipede attacks on me, and are
pleased when I am hurt.'</p>

<p>But she knew her own Irish at the game.  So she was able to put
Juana and the girls away from her, and isolate herself from them.
Once they were put away, their malevolence subsided and they
remembered what Kate wanted.  While she stayed amiable, they
forgot.  They forgot to sweep the patio, they forgot to keep
themselves clean.  Only when they were shoved back, into isolation,
did they remember again.</p>

<p>The boy, Ezequiel, seemed to her to have more honour than the
women.  He never made these insidious attacks.</p>

<p>And when her house was clean and quiet and the air seemed cleaned
again, the soul renewed, her old fondness for the family came back.
Their curious flitting, coming and going, like birds: the busy
clap - clap - clapping of tortillas, the excited scrunching of
tomatoes and chile on the metate, as Juana prepared sauce.  The
noise of the bucket in the well.  Jes&uacute;s, come to water the garden.</p>

<p>The game, the game of it all!  Everything they did must be fun, or
they could not do it.  They could not abstract themselves to a
routine.  Never.  Everything must be fun, must be variable, must be
a bit of an adventure.  It was confusion, but after all, a living
confusion, not a dead, dreary thing.  Kate remembered her English
servants in the English kitchens: so mechanical and somehow
inhuman.  Well, this was the other extreme.</p>

<p>Here there was no discipline nor method at all.  Although Juana and
her brats really wanted to do the things Kate wished they must do
them their own way.  Sometimes Kate felt distracted: after all, the
mechanical lines are so much EASIER to follow.  But as far as
possible, she let the family be.  She had to get used, for example,
to the vagaries of her dining-table: a little round table that
always stood on the veranda.  At breakfast time it would be
discreetly set under the plantas by the salon; for dinner, at one
o'clock, it would have travelled way down the veranda; for tea it
might be under a little tree on the grass.  And then Juana would
decide that the Ni&ntilde;a must take supper, two eggs, rancheros, in the
dining-room itself, isolated at the corner of the long dining-table
meant for fourteen people.</p>

<p>The same with the dishes.  Why they should, after washing up in the
big bowls in the kitchen for several days, suddenly struggle way
down to the lake with the unwashed pots in a basket on Concha's
shoulder, Kate never knew.  Except for the fun of the thing.</p>

<p>Children!  But, then, not at all children.  None of the wondering
insouciance of childhood.  Something dark and cognisant in their
souls all the time: some heavy weight of resistance.  They worked
in fits and starts, and could be very industrious; then came days
when they lay about on the ground like pigs.  At times they were
merry, seated round on the ground in groups, like Arabian nights,
and laughing away.  Then suddenly resisting even merriment in
themselves, relapsing into the numb gloom.  When they were busily
working, suddenly, for no reason, throwing away the tool, as if
resenting having given themselves.  Careless in their morals,
always changing their loves, the men at least resisted all the time
any real giving of themselves.  They didn't want the thing they
were pursuing.  It was the women who drew them on.  And a young man
and a girl going down the road from the lake in the dark, teasing
and poking each other in excitement, would startle Kate because of
their unusualness - the men and women never walked their sex abroad,
as white people do.  And the sudden, sexual laugh of the man, so
strange a sound of pain and desire, obstinate reluctance, and
helpless passion, a noise as if something tearing in his breast,
was a sound to remember.</p>

<p>Kate felt her household a burden.  In a sense, they were like
parasites, they wanted to live on her life, and pull her down, pull
her down.  Again, they were so generous with her, so good and
gentle, she felt they were wonderful.  And then once more she came
up against that unconscious, heavy, reptilian indifference in them,
indifference and resistance.</p>

<p>Her servants were the clue to all the native life, for her.  The
men always together, erect, handsome, balancing their great hats on
the top of their heads and sitting, standing, crouching with a
snake-like impassivity.  The women together separately, soft, and
as if HIDDEN, wrapped tight in their dark rebozos.  Men and women
seemed always to be turning their back on one another, as if they
didn't want to see one another.  No flirting, no courting.  Only an
occasional quick, dark look, the signal of a weapon-like desire,
given and taken.</p>

<p>The women seemed, on the whole, softly callous and determined to go
their own way: to change men if they wished.  And the men seemed
not to care very profoundly.  But it was the women who wanted the
men.</p>

<p>The native women, with their long black hair streaming down their
full, ruddy backs, would bathe at one end of the beach, usually
wearing their chemise, or a little skirt.  The men took absolutely
no notice.  They didn't even look the other way.  It was the women
bathing, that was all.  As if it were, like the charales swimming,
just a natural part of the lake life.  The men just left that part
of the lake to the women.  And the women sat in the shallows of the
lake, isolated in themselves like moor-fowl, pouring water over
their heads and over their ruddy arms from a gourd scoop.</p>

<p>The quiet, unobtrusive, but by no means down-trodden women of the
peon class.  They went their own way, enveloped in their rebozos as
in their own darkness.  They hurried nimbly along, their full
cotton skirts swinging, chirping and quick like birds.  Or they
sat in the lake with long hair streaming, pouring water over
themselves: again like birds.  Or they passed with a curious slow
inevitability up the lake-shore, with a heavy red jar of water
perched on one shoulder, one arm over the head, holding the rim of
the jar.  They had to carry all water from the lake to their
houses.  There was no town supply.  Or, especially on Sunday
afternoons, they sat in their doorways de-lousing one another.  The
most resplendent belles, with magnificent black wavy hair, were
most thoroughly de-loused.  It was as if it were a meritorious
public act.</p>

<p>The men were the obvious figures.  They assert themselves on the
air.  They are the dominant.  Usually they are in loose groups,
talking quietly, or silent: always standing or sitting apart,
rarely touching one another.  Often a single man would stand alone
at a street corner in his serape, motionless for hours, like some
powerful spectre.  Or a man would lie on the beach as if he had
been cast up dead from the waters.  Impassive, motionless, they
would sit side by side on the benches of the plaza, not exchanging
a word.  Each one isolated in his own fate, his eyes black and
quick like a snake's, and as blank.</p>

<p>It seemed to Kate that the highest thing this country might produce
would be some powerful relationship of man to man.  Marriage itself
would always be a casual thing.  Though the men seemed very gentle
and protective to the little children.  Then they forgot them.</p>

<p>But sex itself was a powerful, potent thing, not to be played with
or paraded.  The one mystery.  And a mystery greater than the
individual.  The individual hardly counted.</p>

<p>It was strange to Kate to see the Indian huts on the shore, little
holes built of straw or corn-stalks, with half-naked children
squatting on the naked earth floor, and a lousy woman-squalor
around, a litter of rags and bones, and a sharp smell of human
excrement.  The people have no noses.  And standing silent and
erect not far from the hole of the doorway, the man, handsome and
impassive.  How could it be, that such a fine-looking human male
should be so absolutely indifferent, content with such paltry
squalor?</p>

<p>But there he was, unconscious.  He seemed to have life and passion
in him.  And she knew he was strong.  No men in the world can carry
heavier loads on their backs, for longer distances, than these
Indians.  She had seen an Indian trotting down a street with a
piano on his back: holding it, also, by a band round his forehead.
From his forehead, and on his spine he carried it, trotting along.
The women carry with a band round the breast.</p>

<p>So there is strength.  And APPARENTLY, there is passionate life.
But no energy.  Nowhere in Mexico is there any sign of energy.
This is, as it were, switched off.</p>

<p>Even the new artisan class, though it imitates the artisan class of
the United States, has no real energy.  There are workmen's clubs.
The workmen dress up and parade a best girl on their arm.  But
somehow it seems what it is, only a weak imitation.</p>

<p>Kate's family was increased, without her expecting it.  One day
there arrived from Ocotlan a beautiful ox-eyed girl of about
fifteen, wrapped in her black cotton rebozo, and somewhat towny in
her Madonna-meekness: Maria del Carmen.  With her, Julio, a
straight and fierce young man of twenty-two.  They had just been
married, and had come to Sayula for a visit.  Julio was Juana's
cousin.</p>

<p>Might they sleep in the patio with herself and the girls, was
Juana's request.  They would stay only two days.</p>

<p>Kate was amazed.  Maria del Carmen must have had some Spanish
blood, her beauty was touched with Spain.  She seemed even refined
and superior.  Yet she was to sleep out on the ground like a dog,
with her young husband.  And he, so erect and proud-looking,
possessed nothing in the world but an old serape.</p>

<p>'There are three spare bedrooms,' said Kate.  'They may sleep in
one of those.'</p>

<p>The beds were single beds.  Would they need more blankets? she
asked Juana.</p>

<p>No!  They would manage with the one serape of Julio's.</p>

<p>The new family had arrived.  Julio was a bricklayer.  That is to
say, he worked building the adobe walls of the little houses.  He
belonged to Sayula, and had come back for a visit.</p>

<p>The visit continued.  Julio would come striding in at midday and at
evening; he was looking for work.  Maria del Carmen, in her one
black dress, would squat on the floor and pat tortillas.  She was
allowed to cook them in Juana's kitchen hole.  And she talked and
laughed with the girls.  At night, when Julio was home, he would
lie on the ground with his back to the wall, impassive, while Maria
del Carmen fondled his thick black hair.</p>

<p>They were in love.  But even now, he was not yielding to his love.</p>

<p>She wanted to go back to Ocotlan, where she was at home, and more a
se&ntilde;orita than here in Sayula.  But he refused.  There was no money:
the young m&eacute;nage lived on about five American cents a day.</p>

<p>Kate was sewing.  Maria del Carmen, who didn't even know how to put
a chemise together, watched with great eyes.  Kate taught her, and
bought a length of cotton material.  Maria del Carmen was sewing
herself a dress!</p>

<p>Julio had got work at a peso a day.  The visit continued.  Kate
thought Julio wasn't very nice with Maria del Carmen: his quiet
voice was so overbearing in command when he spoke to her.  And
Maria del Carmen, who was a bit towny, did not take it well.  She
brooded a little.</p>

<p>The visit stretched into weeks.  And now Juana was getting a bit
tired of her relative.</p>

<p>But Julio had got a bit of money.  He had rented a little one-room
adobe house, at one peso fifty per week.  Maria del Carmen was
going to move into her own home.</p>

<p>Kate saw the new outfit got together.  It consisted of one straw
mat, three cooking-plates of earthenware, five bits of native
crockery, two wooden spoons, one knife and Julio's old blanket.
That was all.  But Maria del Carmen was moving in.</p>

<p>Kate presented her with a large old eiderdown, whose silk was
rather worn, a couple of bowls, and a few more bits of crockery.
Maria del Carmen was set up.  Good!  Good!  Oh good!  Kate heard
her voice down the patio.  I have got a coverlet!  I have got a
coverlet!</p>

<p>In the rainy season, the nights can be very cold, owing to
evaporation.  Then the natives lie through the small hours like
lizards, numb and prostrate with cold.  They are lying on the damp
earth on a thin straw mat, with a corner of an old blanket to cover
them.  And the same terrible inertia makes them endure it, without
trying to make any change.  They could carry in corn husks or dry
banana leaves for a bed.  They could even cover themselves with
banana leaves.</p>

<p>But no!  On a thin mat on damp cold earth they lie and tremble with
cold, night after night, night after night, night after night.</p>

<p>But Maria del Carmen was a bit towny.  Oh good!  Oh good!  I've got
a coverlet!</p>
