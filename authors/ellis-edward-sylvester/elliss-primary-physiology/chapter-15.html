<p>The muscles which move the bones are themselves moved by the
nerves. The nerves are soft and pulpy in youth, but harden as
you advance in years. They are composed of a gray substance, called
the nerve-cell, and a white substance, known as the nerve-fibre.</p>

<p>The brain is the mass of nervous tissue within the skull. It
is so tender and easily harmed that nature has walled it about
by a hard, bony structure to protect it from injury.</p>

<p>The gray substance of the nerves is where nervous impulses begin,
which are conducted along the white substance. The gray matter
may be compared to a telegraph office where the message is started,
while the white matter is the wire along which the message travels.</p>

<p>The spinal cord, or marrow, is a mass of soft, nervous tissue,
which fills the hollow running the length of the spine or backbone.</p>

<p>From the base of the brain twelve pairs of nerves are given off
to the face and head. One pair passes to the eye, and gives sight;
one passes to the nose, and gives smell; one, to the mouth, tongue,
and palate, and gives taste; one, to the ears, and gives hearing;
and others to the face, neck, and head, and give the expressions
of joy, sorrow, pain, anger, and doubt.</p>

<p>From the spinal cord thirty-one pairs of nerves pass to the various
parts and organs of the body.</p>

<p>There could be no motion or feeling without the nerves, although
they are not the true centres of either. If you obey the rules
of health, as already laid down, you will be in the happy condition
of those of whom it is said they do not feel that they have any
nerves at all.</p>

<p>  What move the muscles? How are the nerves in early youth? Of
what   are they composed? What are these parts called?</p>

<p>  What is the brain? How is it protected?</p>

<p>  Where do nervous impulses begin? To what may the gray and white  
matter be compared?</p>

<p>  What is the spinal cord?</p>

<p>  How many pairs of nerves are given off from the brain? From
the   spine? Where do they go?</p>

<p>  What is said of sensation and feeling? What if you obey the
laws of   health? </p>
