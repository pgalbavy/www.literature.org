<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The next day a new ambition entered into Penrod Schofield; it
was heralded by a flourish of trumpets and set up a great noise
within his being.</p>

<p>On his way home from Sunday-school he had paused at a corner
to listen to a brass band, which was returning from a funeral,
playing a medley of airs from "The Merry Widow," and as the musicians
came down the street, walking so gracefully, the sun picked out
the gold braid upon their uniforms and splashed fire from their
polished instruments. Penrod marked the shapes of the great bass
horns, the suave sculpture of their brazen coils, and the grand,
sensational flare of their mouths. And he saw plainly that these
noble things, to be mastered, needed no more than some breath
blown into them during the fingering of a few simple keys. Then
obediently they gave forth those vast but dulcet sounds which
stirred his spirit as no other sounds could stir it quite.</p>

<p>The leader of the band, walking ahead, was a pleasing figure,
nothing more. Penrod supposed him to be a mere decoration, and
had never sympathized with Sam Williams' deep feeling about drum-majors.
The cornets, the trombones, the smaller horns were rather interesting,
of course; and the drums had charm, especially the bass drum,
which must be partially supported by a youth in front; but, immeasurably
above all these, what fascinated Penrod was the little man with
the monster horn. There Penrod's widening eyes remained transfixed&mdash;upon
the horn, so dazzling, with its broad spaces of brassy highlights,
and so overwhelming, with its mouth as wide as a tub; that there
was something almost threatening about it.</p>

<p>The little, elderly band-musician walked manfully as he blew
his great horn; and in that pompous engine of sound, the boy beheld
a spectacle of huge forces under human control. To Penrod, the
horn meant power, and the musician meant mastery over power, though,
of course, Penrod did not know that this was how he really felt
about the matter.</p>

<p>Grandiloquent sketches were passing and interchanging before
his mind's eye &mdash;Penrod, in noble raiment, marching down
the staring street, his shoulders swaying professionally, the
roar of the horn he bore submerging all other sounds; Penrod on
horseback, blowing the enormous horn and leading wild hordes to
battle, while Marjorie Jones looked on from the sidewalk; Penrod
astounding his mother and father and sister by suddenly serenading
them in the library. "Why, Penrod, where <em>DID </em>you learn
to play like this?"</p>

<p>These were vague and shimmering glories of vision rather than
definite plans for his life work, yet he did with all his will
determine to own and play upon some roaring instrument of brass.
And, after all, this was no new desire of his; it was only an
old one inflamed to take a new form. Nor was music the root of
it, for the identical desire is often uproarious among them that
hate music. What stirred in Penrod was new neither in him nor
in the world, but old&mdash;old as old Adam, old as the childishness
of man. All children have it, of course: they are all anxious
to Make a Noise in the World.</p>

<p>While the band approached, Penrod marked the time with his feet;
then he fell into step and accompanied the musicians down the
street, keeping as near as possible to the little man with the
big horn. There were four or five other boys, strangers, also
marching with the band, but these were light spirits, their flushed
faces and prancing legs proving that they were merely in a state
of emotional reaction to music. Penrod, on the contrary, was grave.
He kept his eyes upon the big horn, and, now and then, he gave
an imitation of it. His fingers moved upon invisible keys, his
cheeks puffed out, and, from far down in his throat, he produced
strange sounds: "Taw, p'taw-p'taw! Taw, p'taw-p'taw! <em>PAW</em>!"</p>

<p>The other boys turned back when the musicians ceased to play,
but Penrod marched on, still keeping close to what so inspired
him. He stayed with the band till the last member of it disappeared
up a staircase in an office-building, down at the business end
of the street; and even after that he lingered a while, looking
at the staircase.</p>

<p>Finally, however, he set his face toward home, whither he marched
in a procession, the visible part of which consisted of himself
alone. All the way the rhythmic movements of his head kept time
with his marching feet and, also, with a slight rise and fall
of his fingers at about the median line of his abdomen. And pedestrians
who encountered him in this preoccupation were not surprised to
hear, as he passed, a few explosive little vocalizations: "Taw,
p'taw-p'taw! <em>TAW! </em>Taw-aw-<em>HAW</em>!"</p>

<p>These were the outward symptoms of no fleeting impulse, but of
steadfast desire; therefore they were persistent. The likeness
of the great bass horn remained upon the retina of his mind's
eye, losing nothing of its brazen enormity with the passing of
hours, nor abating, in his mind's ear, one whit of its fascinating
blatancy. Penrod might have forgotten almost anything else more
readily; for such a horn has this double compulsion: people cannot
possibly keep themselves from looking at its possessor&mdash;and they
certainly have <em>GOT </em>to listen to him!</p>

<p>Penrod was preoccupied at dinner and during the evening, now
and then causing his father some irritation by croaking, "Taw,
p'taw-p'taw!"  while the latter was talking. And when bedtime
came for the son of the house, he mounted the stairs in a rhythmic
manner, and p'tawed himself through the upper hall as far as his
own chamber.</p>

<p>Even after he had gone to bed, there came a revival of these
manifestations. His mother had put out his light for him and had
returned to the library downstairs; three-quarters of an hour
had elapsed since then, and Margaret was in her room, next to
his, when a continuous low croaking (which she was just able to
hear) suddenly broke out into loud, triumphal blattings:</p>

<p>"<em>TAW, </em>p'taw-p'taw-aw-<em>HAW! P'</em>taw-<em>WAW-</em>aw!
Aw-<em>PAW</em>!"</p>

<p>"Penrod," Margaret called, "stop that! I'm trying to write letters.
If you don't quit and go to sleep, I'll call papa up, and you'll
<em>SEE</em>!"</p>

<p>The noise ceased, or, rather, it tapered down to a desultory
faint croaking which finally died out; but there can be little
doubt that Penrod's last waking thoughts were of instrumental
music. And in the morning, when he woke to face the gloomy day's
scholastic tasks, something unusual and eager fawned in his face
with the return of memory. "Taw-p'taw!" he began. "<em>PAW</em>!"</p>

<p>All day, in school and out, his mind was busy with computations&mdash;not
such as are prescribed by mathematical pedants, but estimates
of how much old rags and old iron would sell for enough money
to buy a horn. Happily, the next day, at lunch, he was able to
dismiss this problem from his mind: he learned that his Uncle
Joe would be passing through town, on his way from Nevada, the
following afternoon, and all the Schofield family were to go to
the station to see him. Penrod would be excused from school.</p>

<p>At this news his cheeks became pink, and for a moment he was
breathless. Uncle Joe and Penrod did not meet often, but when
they did, Uncle Joe invariably gave Penrod money. Moreover, he
always managed to do it privately so that later there was no bothersome
supervision. Last time he had given Penrod a silver dollar.</p>

<p>At thirty-five minutes after two, Wednesday afternoon, Uncle
Joe's train came into the station, and Uncle Joe got out and shouted
among his relatives. At eighteen minutes before three he was waving
to them from the platform of the last car, having just slipped
a two-dollar bill into Penrod's breast-pocket. And, at seven minutes
after three, Penrod opened the door of the largest "music store"
in town.</p>

<p>A tall, exquisite, fair man, evidently a musical earl, stood
before him, leaning whimsically upon a piano of the highest polish.
The sight abashed Penrod not a bit&mdash;his remarkable financial condition
even made him rather peremptory.</p>

<p>"See here," he said brusquely: "I want to look at that big horn
in the window."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the earl; "look at it." And leaned more luxuriously
upon the polished piano.</p>

<p>"I meant&mdash;" Penrod began, but paused, something daunted, while
an unnamed fear brought greater mildness into his voice, as he
continued, "I meant&mdash;I &mdash;How much IS that big horn?"</p>

<p>"How much?" the earl repeated.</p>

<p>"I mean," said Penrod, "how much is it worth?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," the earl returned. "Its price is eighty-five
dollars."</p>

<p>"Eighty-fi&mdash;" Penrod began mechanically, but was forced to pause
and swallow a little air that obstructed his throat, as the difference
between eighty-five and two became more and more startling. He
had entered the store, rich; in the last ten seconds he had become
poverty-stricken. Eighty-five dollars was the same as eighty-five
millions.</p>

<p>"Shall I put it aside for you," asked the salesman-earl, "while
you look around the other stores to see if there's anything you
like better?"</p>

<p>"I guess &mdash;I guess not," said Penrod, whose face had grown
red. He swallowed again, scraped the floor with the side of his
right shoe, scratched the back of his neck, and then, trying to
make his manner casual and easy, "Well I can't stand around here
all day," he said. "I got to be gettin' on up the street."</p>

<p>"Business, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Penrod, turning to the door, suspected jocularity, but he found
himself without recourse; he was nonplussed.</p>

<p>"Sure you won't let me have that horn tied up in nice wrapping-paper
in case you decide to take it?"</p>

<p>Penrod was almost positive that the spirit of this question was
satirical; but he was unable to reply, except by a feeble shake
of the head&mdash;though ten minutes later, as he plodded forlornly
his homeward way, he looked over his shoulder and sent backward
a few words of morose repartee:</p>

<p>"Oh, I am, am I?" he muttered, evidently concluding a conversation
which he had continued mentally with the salesman. "Well, you're
double anything you call me, so that makes you a smart Aleck twice!
Ole double smart Aleck!"</p>

<p>After that, he walked with the least bit more briskness, but
not much. No wonder he felt discouraged: there are times when
eighty-five dollars can be a blow to anybody! Penrod was so stunned
that he actually forgot what was in his pocket. He passed two
drug stores, and they had absolutely no meaning to him. He walked
all the way without spending a cent.</p>

<p>At home he spent a moment in the kitchen pantry while the cook
was in the cellar; then he went out to the stable and began some
really pathetic experiments. His materials were the small tin
funnel which he had obtained in the pantry, and a short section
of old garden hose. He inserted the funnel into one end of the
garden hose, and made it fast by wrappings of cord. Then he arranged
the hose in a double, circular coil, tied it so that it would
remain coiled, and blew into the other end.</p>

<p>He blew and blew and blew; he set his lips tight together, as
he had observed the little musician with the big horn set his,
and blew and sputtered, and sputtered and blew, but nothing of
the slightest importance happened in the orifice of the funnel.
Still he blew. He began to be dizzy; his eyes watered; his expression
became as horrible as a strangled person's. He but blew the more.
He stamped his feet and blew. He staggered to the wheelbarrow,
sat, and blew&mdash;and yet the funnel uttered nothing; it seemed merely
to breathe hard.</p>

<p>It would not sound like a horn, and, when Penrod finally gave
up, he had to admit piteously that it did not look like a horn.
No boy over nine could have pretended that it was a horn.</p>

<p>He tossed the thing upon the floor, and leaned back in the wheelbarrow,
inert.</p>

<p>"Yay, Penrod!"</p>

<p>Sam Williams appeared in the doorway, and, behind Sam, Master
Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior.</p>

<p>"Yay, there!"</p>

<p>Penrod made no response.</p>

<p>The two came in, and Sam picked up the poor contrivance Penrod
had tossed upon the floor.</p>

<p>"What's this ole dingus?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"Nothin'."</p>

<p>"Well, what's it for?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," said Penrod. "It's a kind of a horn."</p>

<p>"What kind?"</p>

<p>"For music," said Penrod simply.</p>

<p>Master Bitts laughed loud and long; he was derisive. "Music!"
he yipped. "I thought you meant a cow's horn! He says it's a music-horn,
Sam? What you think o' that?"</p>

<p>Sam blew into the thing industriously.</p>

<p>"It won't work," he announced.</p>

<p>"Course it won't!" Roddy Bitts shouted. "You can't make it go
without you got a <em>REAL </em>horn. I'm goin' to get me a real
horn some day before long, and then you'll see me goin' up and
down here playin' it like sixty! I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Some day before long!'" Sam mocked. "Yes, we will! Why'n't
you get it to-day, if you're goin' to?"</p>

<p>"I would," said Roddy. "I'd go get the money from my father right
now, only he wouldn't give it to me."</p>

<p>Sam whooped, and Penrod, in spite of his great depression, uttered
a few jibing sounds.</p>

<p>"I'd get MY father to buy me a fire-engine and team o' <em>HORSES,"
</em>Sam bellowed, "only he wouldn't!"</p>

<p>"Listen, can't you?" cried Roddy. "I mean he would most any time,
but not this month. I can't have any money for a month beginning
last Saturday, because I got paint on one of our dogs, and he
came in the house with it on him, and got some on pretty near
everything. If it hadn't 'a' been for that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Sam. "If it hadn't 'a' been for that! It's always
<em>SUMPTHING</em>!"</p>

<p>"It is not!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, why'n't you go <em>GET </em>a real horn?"</p>

<p>Roddy's face had flushed with irritation.</p>

<p>"Well, didn't I just <em>TELL </em>you&mdash;" he began, but paused,
while the renewal of some interesting recollection became visible
in his expression. "Why, I <em>COULD, </em>if I wanted to," he
said more calmly. "It wouldn't be a new one, maybe. I guess it
would be kind of an old one, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, a toy horn!" said Sam. "I expect one you had when you were
three years old, and your mother stuck it up in the attic to keep
till you're dead, or sumpthing!"</p>

<p>"It's not either any toy horn," Roddy insisted. "It's a reg'lar
horn for a band, and I could have it as easy as anything."</p>

<p>The tone of this declaration was so sincere that it roused the
lethargic Penrod.</p>

<p>"Roddy, is that true?" he sat up to inquire piercingly.</p>

<p>"Of course it is!" Master Bitts returned. "What you take me for?
I could go get that horn this minute if I wanted to."</p>

<p>"A real one&mdash;honest?"</p>

<p>"Well, didn't I say it was a real one?"</p>

<p>"Like in the <em>BAND</em>?"</p>

<p>"I said so, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"I guess you mean one of those little ones," said Penrod.</p>

<p>"No, sir!" Roddy insisted stoutly; "it's a big one! It winds
around in a big circle that would go all the way around a pretty
fat man."</p>

<p>"What store is it in?"</p>

<p>"It's not in any store," said Roddy. "It's at my Uncle Ethelbert's.
He's got this horn and three or four pianos and a couple o' harps
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Does he keep a music store?"</p>

<p>"No. These harps and pianos and all such are old ones&mdash;awful
old."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Sam, "he runs a second-hand store!"</p>

<p>"He does not!" Master Bitts returned angrily. "He doesn't do
anything. He's just got 'em. He's got forty-one guitars."</p>

<p>"Yay!" Sam whooped, and jumped up and down. "Listen to Roddy
Bitts makin' up lies!"</p>

<p>"You look out, Sam Williams!" said Roddy threateningly. "You
look out how you call me names!"</p>

<p>"What name'd I call you?"</p>

<p>"You just the same as said I told lies. That's just as good as
callin' me a liar, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Sam; "but I got a right to, if I want to. Haven't
I, Penrod?"</p>

<p>"How?" Roddy demanded hotly. "How you got a right to?"</p>

<p>"Because you can't prove what you said."</p>

<p>"Well," said Roddy, "you'd be just as much of one if you can't
prove what I said <em>WASN'T </em>true."</p>

<p>"No, sir! You either got to prove it or be a liar. Isn't that
so, Penrod.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Penrod ruled, with a little importance, "that's the
way it is, Roddy."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Roddy, "come on over to my Uncle Ethelbert's,
and I'll show you!"</p>

<p>"No," said Sam. "I wouldn't walk over there just to find out
sumpthing I already know isn't so. Outside of a music store there
isn't anybody in the world got forty-one guitars! I've heard lots
o' people <em>TALK, </em>but I never heard such a big l&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shut up!" shouted Roddy. "You ole&mdash;"</p>

<p>Penrod interposed.</p>

<p>"Why'n't you show us the horn, Roddy?" he asked. "You said you
could get it. You show us the horn and we'll believe you. If you
show us the horn, Sam'll haf to take what he said back; won't
you, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sam, and added. "He hasn't got any. He went and told
a&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roddy's eyes were bright with rage; he breathed noisily.</p>

<p>"I haven't?" he cried. "You just wait here, and I'll show you!"</p>

<p>And he ran furiously from the stable.</p>
