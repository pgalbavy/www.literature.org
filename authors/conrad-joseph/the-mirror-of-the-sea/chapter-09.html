<p> Every passage of a ship of yesterday, whose yards were braced
round eagerly the very moment the pilot, with his pockets full
of letters, had got over the side, was like a race—a race against
time, against an ideal standard of achievement outstripping the
expectations of common men. Like all true art, the general conduct
of a ship and her handling in particular cases had a technique
which could be discussed with delight and pleasure by men who
found in their work, not bread alone, but an outlet for the peculiarities
of their temperament.  To get the best and truest effect from
the infinitely varying moods of sky and sea, not pictorially,
but in the spirit of their calling, was their vocation, one and
all; and they recognised this with as much sincerity, and drew
as much inspiration from this reality, as any man who ever put
brush to canvas.  The diversity of temperaments was immense amongst
those masters of the fine art.</p>

<p>Some of them were like Royal Academicians of a certain kind. 
They never startled you by a touch of originality, by a fresh
audacity of inspiration.  They were safe, very safe.  They went
about solemnly in the assurance of their consecrated and empty
reputation.  Names are odious, but I remember one of them who
might have been their very president, the <em>P.R.A. </em>of the
sea-craft.  His weather-beaten and handsome face, his portly presence,
his shirt-fronts and broad cuffs and gold links, his air of bluff
distinction, impressed the humble beholders (stevedores, tally
clerks, tide-waiters) as he walked ashore over the gangway of
his ship lying at the Circular Quay in Sydney.  His voice was
deep, hearty, and authoritative—the voice of a very prince amongst
sailors.  He did everything with an air which put your attention
on the alert and raised your expectations, but the result somehow
was always on stereotyped lines, unsuggestive, empty of any lesson
that one could lay to heart.  He kept his ship in apple-pie order,
which would have been seamanlike enough but for a finicking touch
in its details.  His officers affected a superiority over the
rest of us, but the boredom of their souls appeared in their manner
of dreary submission to the fads of their commander.  It was only
his apprenticed boys whose irrepressible spirits were not affected
by the solemn and respectable mediocrity of that artist.  There
were four of these youngsters: one the son of a doctor, another
of a colonel, the third of a jeweller; the name of the fourth
was Twentyman, and this is all I remember of his parentage.  But
not one of them seemed to possess the smallest spark of gratitude
in his composition.  Though their commander was a kind man in
his way, and had made a point of introducing them to the best
people in the town in order that they should not fall into the
bad company of boys belonging to other ships, I regret to say
that they made faces at him behind his back, and imitated the
dignified carriage of his head without any concealment whatever.</p>

<p>This master of the fine art was a personage and nothing more;
but, as I have said, there was an infinite diversity of temperament
amongst the masters of the fine art I have known.  Some were great
impressionists. They impressed upon you the fear of God and Immensity—or,
in other words, the fear of being drowned with every circumstance
of terrific grandeur. One may think that the locality of your
passing away by means of suffocation in water does not really
matter very much.  I am not so sure of that.  I am, perhaps, unduly
sensitive, but I confess that the idea of being suddenly spilt
into an infuriated ocean in the midst of darkness and uproar affected
me always with a sensation of shrinking distaste.  To be drowned
in a pond, though it might be called an ignominious fate by the
ignorant, is yet a bright and peaceful ending in comparison with
some other endings to one’s earthly career which I have mentally
quaked at in the intervals or even in the midst of violent exertions.</p>

<p>But let that pass.  Some of the masters whose influence left
a trace upon my character to this very day, combined a fierceness
of conception with a certitude of execution upon the basis of
just appreciation of means and ends which is the highest quality
of the man of action.  And an artist is a man of action, whether
he creates a personality, invents an expedient, or finds the issue
of a complicated situation.</p>

<p>There were masters, too, I have known, whose very art consisted
in avoiding every conceivable situation.  It is needless to say
that they never did great things in their craft; but they were
not to be despised for that.  They were modest; they understood
their limitations.  Their own masters had not handed the sacred
fire into the keeping of their cold and skilful hands.  One of
those last I remember specially, now gone to his rest from that
sea which his temperament must have made a scene of little more
than a peaceful pursuit.  Once only did he attempt a stroke of
audacity, one early morning, with a steady breeze, entering a
crowded roadstead.  But he was not genuine in this display which
might have been art.  He was thinking of his own self; he hankered
after the meretricious glory of a showy performance.</p>

<p>As, rounding a dark, wooded point, bathed in fresh air and sunshine,
we opened to view a crowd of shipping at anchor lying half a mile
ahead of us perhaps, he called me aft from my station on the forecastle
head, and, turning over and over his binoculars in his brown hands,
said: "Do you see that big, heavy ship with white lower masts? 
I am going to take up a berth between her and the shore.  Now
do you see to it that the men jump smartly at the first order."</p>

<p>I answered, "Ay, ay, sir," and verily believed that this would
be a fine performance.  We dashed on through the fleet in magnificent
style.  There must have been many open mouths and following eyes
on board those ships—Dutch, English, with a sprinkling of Americans
and a German or two—who had all hoisted their flags at eight o’clock
as if in honour of our arrival.  It would have been a fine performance
if it had come off, but it did not.  Through a touch of self-seeking
that modest artist of solid merit became untrue to his temperament. 
It was not with him art for art’s sake: it was art for his own
sake; and a dismal failure was the penalty he paid for that greatest
of sins.  It might have been even heavier, but, as it happened,
we did not run our ship ashore, nor did we knock a large hole
in the big ship whose lower masts were painted white. But it is
a wonder that we did not carry away the cables of both our anchors,
for, as may be imagined, I did not stand upon the order to "Let
go!" that came to me in a quavering, quite unknown voice from
his trembling lips.  I let them both go with a celerity which
to this day astonishes my memory.  No average merchantman’s anchors
have ever been let go with such miraculous smartness.  And they
both held.  I could have kissed their rough, cold iron palms in
gratitude if they had not been buried in slimy mud under ten fathoms
of water.  Ultimately they brought us up with the jibboom of a
Dutch brig poking through our spanker—nothing worse.  And a miss
is as good as a mile.</p>

<p>But not in art.  Afterwards the master said to me in a shy mumble,
"She wouldn’t luff up in time, somehow.  What’s the matter with
her?"  And I made no answer.</p>

<p>Yet the answer was clear.  The ship had found out the momentary
weakness of her man.  Of all the living creatures upon land and
sea, it is ships alone that cannot be taken in by barren pretences,
that will not put up with bad art from their masters.</p>
