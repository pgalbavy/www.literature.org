<p>We had all meant to go home again. Indeed we had NOT meant--not by any
means--to stay as long as we had. But when it came to being turned out,
dismissed, sent away for bad conduct, we none of us really liked it.
</p>
<p>Terry said he did. He professed great scorn of the penalty and the
trial, as well as all the other characteristics of “this miserable
half-country.” But he knew, and we knew, that in any “whole” country we
should never have been as forgivingly treated as we had been here.
</p><p>“If the people had come after us according to the directions we left,
there’d have been quite a different story!” said Terry. We found out
later why no reserve party had arrived. All our careful directions had
been destroyed in a fire. We might have all died there and no one at
home have ever known our whereabouts.
</p><p>Terry was under guard now, all the time, known as unsafe, convicted of
what was to them an unpardonable sin.
</p><p>He laughed at their chill horror. “Parcel of old maids!” he called them.
“They’re all old maids--children or not. They don’t know the first thing
about Sex.”
</p><p>When Terry said SEX, sex with a very large _S_, he meant the male sex,
naturally; its special values, its profound conviction of being “the
life force,” its cheerful ignoring of the true life process, and its
interpretation of the other sex solely from its own point of view.
</p><p>I had learned to see these things very differently since living with
Ellador; and as for Jeff, he was so thoroughly Herlandized that he
wasn’t fair to Terry, who fretted sharply in his new restraint.
</p><p>Moadine, grave and strong, as sadly patient as a mother with a
degenerate child, kept steady watch on him, with enough other women
close at hand to prevent an outbreak. He had no weapons, and well knew
that all his strength was of small avail against those grim, quiet
women.
</p><p>We were allowed to visit him freely, but he had only his room, and a
small high-walled garden to walk in, while the preparations for our
departure were under way.
</p><p>Three of us were to go: Terry, because he must; I, because two were
safer for our flyer, and the long boat trip to the coast; Ellador,
because she would not let me go without her.
</p><p>If Jeff had elected to return, Celis would have gone too--they were the
most absorbed of lovers; but Jeff had no desire that way.
</p><p>“Why should I want to go back to all our noise and dirt, our vice and
crime, our disease and degeneracy?” he demanded of me privately. We
never spoke like that before the women. “I wouldn’t take Celis there for
anything on earth!” he protested. “She’d die! She’d die of horror and
shame to see our slums and hospitals. How can you risk it with Ellador?
You’d better break it to her gently before she really makes up her
mind.”
</p><p>Jeff was right. I ought to have told her more fully than I did, of all
the things we had to be ashamed of. But it is very hard to bridge the
gulf of as deep a difference as existed between our life and theirs. I
tried to.
</p><p>“Look here, my dear,” I said to her. “If you are really going to my
country with me, you’ve got to be prepared for a good many shocks. It’s
not as beautiful as this--the cities, I mean, the civilized parts--of
course the wild country is.”
</p><p>“I shall enjoy it all,” she said, her eyes starry with hope. “I
understand it’s not like ours. I can see how monotonous our quiet life
must seem to you, how much more stirring yours must be. It must be
like the biological change you told me about when the second sex
was introduced--a far greater movement, constant change, with new
possibilities of growth.”
</p><p>I had told her of the later biological theories of sex, and she
was deeply convinced of the superior advantages of having two, the
superiority of a world with men in it.
</p><p>“We have done what we could alone; perhaps we have some things better
in a quiet way, but you have the whole world--all the people of the
different nations--all the long rich history behind you--all the
wonderful new knowledge. Oh, I just can’t wait to see it!”
</p><p>What could I do? I told her in so many words that we had our unsolved
problems, that we had dishonesty and corruption, vice and crime, disease
and insanity, prisons and hospitals; and it made no more impression on
her than it would to tell a South Sea Islander about the temperature of
the Arctic Circle. She could intellectually see that it was bad to have
those things; but she could not FEEL it.
</p><p>We had quite easily come to accept the Herland life as normal, because
it was normal--none of us make any outcry over mere health and peace
and happy industry. And the abnormal, to which we are all so sadly well
acclimated, she had never seen.
</p><p>The two things she cared most to hear about, and wanted most to see,
were these: the beautiful relation of marriage and the lovely women
who were mothers and nothing else; beyond these her keen, active mind
hungered eagerly for the world life.
</p><p>“I’m almost as anxious to go as you are yourself,” she insisted, “and
you must be desperately homesick.”
</p><p>I assured her that no one could be homesick in such a paradise as
theirs, but she would have none of it.
</p><p>“Oh, yes--I know. It’s like those little tropical islands you’ve told me
about, shining like jewels in the big blue sea--I can’t wait to see the
sea! The little island may be as perfect as a garden, but you always
want to get back to your own big country, don’t you? Even if it is bad
in some ways?”
</p><p>Ellador was more than willing. But the nearer it came to our really
going, and to my having to take her back to our “civilization,” after
the clean peace and beauty of theirs, the more I began to dread it, and
the more I tried to explain.
</p><p>Of course I had been homesick at first, while we were prisoners, before
I had Ellador. And of course I had, at first, rather idealized my
country and its ways, in describing it. Also, I had always accepted
certain evils as integral parts of our civilization and never dwelt on
them at all. Even when I tried to tell her the worst, I never remembered
some things--which, when she came to see them, impressed her at once, as
they had never impressed me. Now, in my efforts at explanation, I began
to see both ways more keenly than I had before; to see the painful
defects of my own land, the marvelous gains of this.
</p><p>In missing men we three visitors had naturally missed the larger part of
life, and had unconsciously assumed that they must miss it too. It took
me a long time to realize--Terry never did realize--how little it
meant to them. When we say MEN, MAN, MANLY, MANHOOD, and all the other
masculine derivatives, we have in the background of our minds a huge
vague crowded picture of the world and all its activities. To grow up
and “be a man,” to “act like a man”--the meaning and connotation is
wide indeed. That vast background is full of marching columns of men, of
changing lines of men, of long processions of men; of men steering
their ships into new seas, exploring unknown mountains, breaking horses,
herding cattle, ploughing and sowing and reaping, toiling at the forge
and furnace, digging in the mine, building roads and bridges and high
cathedrals, managing great businesses, teaching in all the colleges,
preaching in all the churches; of men everywhere, doing everything--“the
world.”
</p><p>And when we say WOMEN, we think FEMALE--the sex.
</p><p>But to these women, in the unbroken sweep of this two-thousand-year-old
feminine civilization, the word WOMAN called up all that big background,
so far as they had gone in social development; and the word MAN meant to
them only MALE--the sex.
</p><p>Of course we could TELL them that in our world men did everything; but
that did not alter the background of their minds. That man, “the male,”
 did all these things was to them a statement, making no more change
in the point of view than was made in ours when we first faced the
astounding fact--to us--that in Herland women were “the world.”
</p><p>We had been living there more than a year. We had learned their limited
history, with its straight, smooth, upreaching lines, reaching higher
and going faster up to the smooth comfort of their present life. We
had learned a little of their psychology, a much wider field than the
history, but here we could not follow so readily. We were now well used
to seeing women not as females but as people; people of all sorts, doing
every kind of work.
</p><p>This outbreak of Terry’s, and the strong reaction against it, gave us
a new light on their genuine femininity. This was given me with great
clearness by both Ellador and Somel. The feeling was the same--sick
revulsion and horror, such as would be felt at some climactic blasphemy.
</p><p>They had no faintest approach to such a thing in their minds, knowing
nothing of the custom of marital indulgence among us. To them the one
high purpose of motherhood had been for so long the governing law of
life, and the contribution of the father, though known to them, so
distinctly another method to the same end, that they could not, with all
their effort, get the point of view of the male creature whose desires
quite ignore parentage and seek only for what we euphoniously term “the
joys of love.”
</p><p>When I tried to tell Ellador that women too felt so, with us, she drew
away from me, and tried hard to grasp intellectually what she could in
no way sympathize with.
</p><p>“You mean--that with you--love between man and woman expresses itself in
that way--without regard to motherhood? To parentage, I mean,” she added
carefully.
</p><p>“Yes, surely. It is love we think of--the deep sweet love between two.
Of course we want children, and children come--but that is not what we
think about.”
</p><p>“But--but--it seems so against nature!” she said. “None of the creatures
we know do that. Do other animals--in your country?”
</p><p>“We are not animals!” I replied with some sharpness. “At least we
are something more--something higher. This is a far nobler and more
beautiful relation, as I have explained before. Your view seems to us
rather--shall I say, practical? Prosaic? Merely a means to an end! With
us--oh, my dear girl--cannot you see? Cannot you feel? It is the last,
sweetest, highest consummation of mutual love.”
</p><p>She was impressed visibly. She trembled in my arms, as I held her close,
kissing her hungrily. But there rose in her eyes that look I knew so
well, that remote clear look as if she had gone far away even though
I held her beautiful body so close, and was now on some snowy mountain
regarding me from a distance.
</p><p>“I feel it quite clearly,” she said to me. “It gives me a deep sympathy
with what you feel, no doubt more strongly still. But what I feel, even
what you feel, dearest, does not convince me that it is right. Until I
am sure of that, of course I cannot do as you wish.”
</p><p>Ellador, at times like this, always reminded me of Epictetus. “I will
put you in prison!” said his master. “My body, you mean,” replied
Epictetus calmly. “I will cut your head off,” said his master. “Have I
said that my head could not be cut off?” A difficult person, Epictetus.
</p><p>What is this miracle by which a woman, even in your arms, may withdraw
herself, utterly disappear till what you hold is as inaccessible as the
face of a cliff?
</p><p>“Be patient with me, dear,” she urged sweetly. “I know it is hard for
you. And I begin to see--a little--how Terry was so driven to crime.”
</p><p>“Oh, come, that’s a pretty hard word for it. After all, Alima was
his wife, you know,” I urged, feeling at the moment a sudden burst of
sympathy for poor Terry. For a man of his temperament--and habits--it
must have been an unbearable situation.
</p><p>But Ellador, for all her wide intellectual grasp, and the broad sympathy
in which their religion trained them, could not make allowance for
such--to her--sacrilegious brutality.
</p><p>It was the more difficult to explain to her, because we three, in our
constant talks and lectures about the rest of the world, had naturally
avoided the seamy side; not so much from a desire to deceive, but from
wishing to put the best foot foremost for our civilization, in the face
of the beauty and comfort of theirs. Also, we really thought some things
were right, or at least unavoidable, which we could readily see would be
repugnant to them, and therefore did not discuss. Again there was much
of our world’s life which we, being used to it, had not noticed as
anything worth describing. And still further, there was about these
women a colossal innocence upon which many of the things we did say had
made no impression whatever.
</p><p>I am thus explicit about it because it shows how unexpectedly strong
was the impression made upon Ellador when she at last entered our
civilization.
</p><p>She urged me to be patient, and I was patient. You see, I loved her so
much that even the restrictions she so firmly established left me much
happiness. We were lovers, and there is surely delight enough in that.
</p><p>Do not imagine that these young women utterly refused “the Great New
Hope,” as they called it, that of dual parentage. For that they had
agreed to marry us, though the marrying part of it was a concession
to our prejudices rather than theirs. To them the process was the holy
thing--and they meant to keep it holy.
</p><p>But so far only Celis, her blue eyes swimming in happy tears, her
heart lifted with that tide of race-motherhood which was their supreme
passion, could with ineffable joy and pride announce that she was to
be a mother. “The New Motherhood” they called it, and the whole country
knew. There was no pleasure, no service, no honor in all the land that
Celis might not have had. Almost like the breathless reverence with
which, two thousand years ago, that dwindling band of women had watched
the miracle of virgin birth, was the deep awe and warm expectancy with
which they greeted this new miracle of union.
</p><p>All mothers in that land were holy. To them, for long ages, the approach
to motherhood has been by the most intense and exquisite love and
longing, by the Supreme Desire, the overmastering demand for a child.
Every thought they held in connection with the processes of maternity
was open to the day, simple yet sacred. Every woman of them placed
motherhood not only higher than other duties, but so far higher that
there were no other duties, one might almost say. All their wide mutual
love, all the subtle interplay of mutual friendship and service,
the urge of progressive thought and invention, the deepest religious
emotion, every feeling and every act was related to this great central
Power, to the River of Life pouring through them, which made them the
bearers of the very Spirit of God.
</p><p>Of all this I learned more and more--from their books, from talk,
especially from Ellador. She was at first, for a brief moment, envious
of her friend--a thought she put away from her at once and forever.
</p><p>“It is better,” she said to me. “It is much better that it has not come
to me yet--to us, that is. For if I am to go with you to your country,
we may have ‘adventures by sea and land,’ as you say [and as in truth we
did], and it might not be at all safe for a baby. So we won’t try again,
dear, till it is safe--will we?”
</p><p>This was a hard saying for a very loving husband.
</p><p>“Unless,” she went on, “if one is coming, you will leave me behind. You
can come back, you know--and I shall have the child.”
</p><p>Then that deep ancient chill of male jealousy of even his own progeny
touched my heart.
</p><p>“I’d rather have you, Ellador, than all the children in the world. I’d
rather have you with me--on your own terms--than not to have you.”
</p><p>This was a very stupid saying. Of course I would! For if she wasn’t
there I should want all of her and have none of her. But if she went
along as a sort of sublimated sister--only much closer and warmer than
that, really--why I should have all of her but that one thing. And I
was beginning to find that Ellador’s friendship, Ellador’s comradeship,
Ellador’s sisterly affection, Ellador’s perfectly sincere love--none
the less deep that she held it back on a definite line of reserve--were
enough to live on very happily.
</p><p>I find it quite beyond me to describe what this woman was to me. We talk
fine things about women, but in our hearts we know that they are very
limited beings--most of them. We honor them for their functional powers,
even while we dishonor them by our use of it; we honor them for their
carefully enforced virtue, even while we show by our own conduct how
little we think of that virtue; we value them, sincerely, for the
perverted maternal activities which make our wives the most comfortable
of servants, bound to us for life with the wages wholly at our own
decision, their whole business, outside of the temporary duties of such
motherhood as they may achieve, to meet our needs in every way. Oh, we
value them, all right, “in their place,” which place is the home, where
they perform that mixture of duties so ably described by Mrs. Josephine
Dodge Daskam Bacon, in which the services of “a mistress” are carefully
specified. She is a very clear writer, Mrs. J. D. D. Bacon, and
understands her subject--from her own point of view. But--that
combination of industries, while convenient, and in a way economical,
does not arouse the kind of emotion commanded by the women of Herland.
These were women one had to love “up,” very high up, instead of down.
They were not pets. They were not servants. They were not timid,
inexperienced, weak.
</p><p>After I got over the jar to my pride (which Jeff, I truly think, never
felt--he was a born worshipper, and which Terry never got over--he
was quite clear in his ideas of “the position of women”), I found that
loving “up” was a very good sensation after all. It gave me a queer
feeling, way down deep, as of the stirring of some ancient dim
prehistoric consciousness, a feeling that they were right somehow--that
this was the way to feel. It was like--coming home to mother. I don’t
mean the underflannels-and-doughnuts mother, the fussy person that waits
on you and spoils you and doesn’t really know you. I mean the feeling
that a very little child would have, who had been lost--for ever so
long. It was a sense of getting home; of being clean and rested;
of safety and yet freedom; of love that was always there, warm like
sunshine in May, not hot like a stove or a featherbed--a love that
didn’t irritate and didn’t smother.
</p><p>I looked at Ellador as if I hadn’t seen her before. “If you won’t go,”
 I said, “I’ll get Terry to the coast and come back alone. You can let me
down a rope. And if you will go--why you blessed wonder-woman--I would
rather live with you all my life--like this--than to have any other
woman I ever saw, or any number of them, to do as I like with. Will you
come?”
</p><p>She was keen for coming. So the plans went on. She’d have liked to wait
for that Marvel of Celis’s, but Terry had no such desire. He was crazy
to be out of it all. It made him sick, he said, SICK; this everlasting
mother-mother-mothering. I don’t think Terry had what the phrenologists
call “the lump of philoprogenitiveness” at all well developed.
</p><p>“Morbid one-sided cripples,” he called them, even when from his window
he could see their splendid vigor and beauty; even while Moadine, as
patient and friendly as if she had never helped Alima to hold and bind
him, sat there in the room, the picture of wisdom and serene strength.
“Sexless, epicene, undeveloped neuters!” he went on bitterly. He sounded
like Sir Almwroth Wright.
</p><p>Well--it was hard. He was madly in love with Alima, really; more so than
he had ever been before, and their tempestuous courtship, quarrels, and
reconciliations had fanned the flame. And then when he sought by that
supreme conquest which seems so natural a thing to that type of man, to
force her to love him as her master--to have the sturdy athletic furious
woman rise up and master him--she and her friends--it was no wonder he
raged.
</p><p>Come to think of it, I do not recall a similar case in all history or
fiction. Women have killed themselves rather than submit to outrage;
they have killed the outrager; they have escaped; or they have
submitted--sometimes seeming to get on very well with the victor
afterward. There was that adventure of “false Sextus,” for instance,
who “found Lucrese combing the fleece, under the midnight lamp.” He
threatened, as I remember, that if she did not submit he would slay her,
slay a slave and place him beside her and say he found him there. A poor
device, it always seemed to me. If Mr. Lucretius had asked him how he
came to be in his wife’s bedroom overlooking her morals, what could he
have said? But the point is Lucrese submitted, and Alima didn’t.
</p><p>“She kicked me,” confided the embittered prisoner--he had to talk to
someone. “I was doubled up with the pain, of course, and she jumped on
me and yelled for this old harpy [Moadine couldn’t hear him] and they
had me trussed up in no time. I believe Alima could have done it alone,”
 he added with reluctant admiration. “She’s as strong as a horse. And
of course a man’s helpless when you hit him like that. No woman with a
shade of decency--”
</p><p>I had to grin at that, and even Terry did, sourly. He wasn’t given to
reasoning, but it did strike him that an assault like his rather waived
considerations of decency.
</p><p>“I’d give a year of my life to have her alone again,” he said slowly,
his hands clenched till the knuckles were white.
</p><p>But he never did. She left our end of the country entirely, went up into
the fir-forest on the highest slopes, and stayed there. Before we left
he quite desperately longed to see her, but she would not come and he
could not go. They watched him like lynxes. (Do lynxes watch any better
than mousing cats, I wonder!)
</p><p>Well--we had to get the flyer in order, and be sure there was enough
fuel left, though Terry said we could glide all right, down to that
lake, once we got started. We’d have gone gladly in a week’s time, of
course, but there was a great to-do all over the country about
Ellador’s leaving them. She had interviews with some of the leading
ethicists--wise women with still eyes, and with the best of the
teachers. There was a stir, a thrill, a deep excitement everywhere.
</p><p>Our teaching about the rest of the world has given them all a sense
of isolation, of remoteness, of being a little outlying sample of a
country, overlooked and forgotten among the family of nations. We had
called it “the family of nations,” and they liked the phrase immensely.
</p><p>They were deeply aroused on the subject of evolution; indeed, the whole
field of natural science drew them irresistibly. Any number of them
would have risked everything to go to the strange unknown lands and
study; but we could take only one, and it had to be Ellador, naturally.
</p><p>We planned greatly about coming back, about establishing a connecting
route by water; about penetrating those vast forests and civilizing--or
exterminating--the dangerous savages. That is, we men talked of that
last--not with the women. They had a definite aversion to killing
things.
</p><p>But meanwhile there was high council being held among the wisest of them
all. The students and thinkers who had been gathering facts from us all
this time, collating and relating them, and making inferences, laid the
result of their labors before the council.
</p><p>Little had we thought that our careful efforts at concealment had been
so easily seen through, with never a word to show us that they saw. They
had followed up words of ours on the science of optics, asked innocent
questions about glasses and the like, and were aware of the defective
eyesight so common among us.
</p><p>With the lightest touch, different women asking different questions at
different times, and putting all our answers together like a picture
puzzle, they had figured out a sort of skeleton chart as to the
prevalence of disease among us. Even more subtly with no show of horror
or condemnation, they had gathered something--far from the truth, but
something pretty clear--about poverty, vice, and crime. They even had
a goodly number of our dangers all itemized, from asking us about
insurance and innocent things like that.
</p><p>They were well posted as to the different races, beginning with their
poison-arrow natives down below and widening out to the broad racial
divisions we had told them about. Never a shocked expression of the face
or exclamation of revolt had warned us; they had been extracting the
evidence without our knowing it all this time, and now were studying
with the most devout earnestness the matter they had prepared.
</p><p>The result was rather distressing to us. They first explained the matter
fully to Ellador, as she was the one who purposed visiting the Rest
of the World. To Celis they said nothing. She must not be in any way
distressed, while the whole nation waited on her Great Work.
</p><p>Finally Jeff and I were called in. Somel and Zava were there, and
Ellador, with many others that we knew.
</p><p>They had a great globe, quite fairly mapped out from the small section
maps in that compendium of ours. They had the different peoples of the
earth roughly outlined, and their status in civilization indicated.
They had charts and figures and estimates, based on the facts in that
traitorous little book and what they had learned from us.
</p><p>Somel explained: “We find that in all your historic period, so much
longer than ours, that with all the interplay of services, the exchange
of inventions and discoveries, and the wonderful progress we so admire,
that in this widespread Other World of yours, there is still much
disease, often contagious.”
</p><p>We admitted this at once.
</p><p>“Also there is still, in varying degree, ignorance, with prejudice and
unbridled emotion.”
</p><p>This too was admitted.
</p><p>“We find also that in spite of the advance of democracy and the increase
of wealth, that there is still unrest and sometimes combat.”
</p><p>Yes, yes, we admitted it all. We were used to these things and saw no
reason for so much seriousness.
</p><p>“All things considered,” they said, and they did not say a hundredth
part of the things they were considering, “we are unwilling to expose
our country to free communication with the rest of the world--as yet. If
Ellador comes back, and we approve her report, it may be done later--but
not yet.
</p><p>“So we have this to ask of you gentlemen [they knew that word was held
a title of honor with us], that you promise not in any way to betray the
location of this country until permission--after Ellador’s return.”
</p><p>Jeff was perfectly satisfied. He thought they were quite right. He
always did. I never saw an alien become naturalized more quickly than
that man in Herland.
</p><p>I studied it awhile, thinking of the time they’d have if some of our
contagions got loose there, and concluded they were right. So I agreed.
</p><p>Terry was the obstacle. “Indeed I won’t!” he protested. “The first
thing I’ll do is to get an expedition fixed up to force an entrance into
Ma-land.”
</p><p>“Then,” they said quite calmly, “he must remain an absolute prisoner,
always.”
</p><p>“Anesthesia would be kinder,” urged Moadine.
</p><p>“And safer,” added Zava.
</p><p>“He will promise, I think,” said Ellador.
</p><p>And he did. With which agreement we at last left Herland.
