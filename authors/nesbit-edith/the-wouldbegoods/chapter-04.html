<p>
It was very rough on Dora having her foot bad, but we took it in
turns to stay in with her, and she was very decent about it.  Daisy
was most with her.  I do not dislike Daisy, but I wish she had been
taught how to play.  Because Dora is rather like that naturally,
and sometimes I have thought that Daisy makes her worse.</p>

<p>I talked to Albert's uncle about it one day, when the others had
gone to church, and I did not go because of ear-ache, and he said
it came from reading the wrong sort of books partly - she has read
Ministering Children, and Anna Ross, or The Orphan of Waterloo, and
Ready Work for Willing Hands, and Elsie, or Like a Little Candle,
and even a horrid little blue book about the something or other of
Little Sins.  After this conversation Oswald took care she had
plenty of the right sort of books to read, and he was surprised and
pleased when she got up early one morning to finish Monte Cristo. 
Oswald felt that he was really being useful to a suffering
fellow-creature when he gave Daisy books that were not all about
being good.</p>

<p>A few days after Dora was laid up, Alice called a council of the
Wouldbegoods, and Oswald and Dicky attended with darkly-clouded
brows.  Alice had the minute-book, which was an exercise-book that
had not much written in it.  She had begun at the other end.  I
hate doing that myself, because there is so little room at the top
compared with right way up.</p>

<p>Dora and a sofa had been carried out on to the lawn, and we were on
the grass.  It was very hot and dry.  We had sherbet.  Alice read:</p>

<p>'&quot;Society of the Wouldbegoods.</p>

<p>'&quot;We have not done much.  Dicky mended a window, and we got the
milk-pan out of the moat that dropped through where he mended it. 
Dora, Oswald, Dicky and me got upset in the moat.  This was not
goodness.  Dora's foot was hurt.  We hope to do better next time.&quot;'</p>

<p>Then came Noel's poem:</p>

<blockquote><div>'We are the Wouldbegoods Society,<br />
We are not good yet, but we mean to try,<br />
And if we try, and if we don't succeed,<br />
It must mean we are very bad indeed.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>This sounded so much righter than Noel's poetry generally does,
that Oswald said so, and Noel explained that Denny had helped him.</p>

<p>'He seems to know the right length for lines of poetry.  I suppose
it comes of learning so much at school,' Noel said.</p>

<p>Then Oswald proposed that anybody should be allowed to write in the
book if they found out anything good that anyone else had done, but
not things that were public acts; and nobody was to write about
themselves, or anything other people told them, only what they
found out.</p>

<p>After a brief jaw the others agreed, and Oswald felt, not for the
first time in his young life, that he would have made a good
diplomatic hero to carry despatches and outwit the other side.  For
now he had put it out of the minute-book's power to be the kind of
thing readers of Ministering Children would have wished.</p>

<p>'And if anyone tells other people any good thing he's done he is to
go to Coventry for the rest of the day.'</p>

<p>And Denny remarked, 'We shall do good by stealth, and blush to find
it shame.'</p>

<p>After that nothing was written in the book for some time.  I looked
about, and so did the others, but I never caught anyone in the act
of doing anything extra; though several of the others have told me
since of things they did at this time, and really wondered nobody
had noticed.</p>

<p>I think I said before that when you tell a story you cannot tell
everything.  It would be silly to do it.  Because ordinary kinds of
play are dull to read about; and the only other thing is meals, and
to dwell on what you eat is greedy and not like a hero at all.  A
hero is always contented with a venison pasty and a horn of sack. 
All the same, the meals were very interesting; with things you do
not get at home - Lent pies with custard and currants in them,
sausage rolls and fiede cakes, and raisin cakes and apple
turnovers, and honeycomb and syllabubs, besides as much new milk as
you cared about, and cream now and then, and cheese always on the
table for tea.  Father told Mrs Pettigrew to get what meals she
liked, and she got these strange but attractive foods.</p>

<p>In a story about Wouldbegoods it is not proper to tell of times
when only some of us were naughty, so I will pass lightly over the
time when Noel got up the kitchen chimney and brought three bricks
and an old starling's nest and about a ton of soot down with him
when he fell.  They never use the big chimney in the summer, but
cook in the wash-house.  Nor do I wish to dwell on what H. O. did
when he went into the dairy.  I do not know what his motive was. 
But Mrs Pettigrew said SHE knew; and she locked him in, and said if
it was cream he wanted he should have enough, and she wouldn't let
him out till tea-time.  The cat had also got into the dairy for
some reason of her own, and when H. O. was tired of whatever he
went in for he poured all the milk into the churn and tried to
teach the cat to swim in it.  He must have been desperate.  The cat
did not even try to learn, and H. O. had the scars on his hands for
weeks.  I do not wish to tell tales of H. O., for he is very young,
and whatever he does he always catches it for; but I will just
allude to our being told not to eat the greengages in the garden. 
And we did not.  And whatever H. O. did was Noel's fault - for Noel
told H. O. that greengages would grow again all right if you did
not bite as far as the stone, just as wounds are not mortal except
when you are pierced through the heart.  So the two of them bit
bites out of every greengage they could reach.  And of course the
pieces did not grow again.</p>

<p>Oswald did not do things like these, but then he is older than his
brothers.  The only thing he did just about then was making a
booby-trap for Mrs Pettigrew when she had locked H. O. up in the
dairy, and unfortunately it was the day she was going out in her
best things, and part of the trap was a can of water.  Oswald was
not willingly vicious; it was but a light and thoughtless act which
he had every reason to be sorry for afterwards.  And he is sorry
even without those reasons, because he knows it is ungentlemanly to
play tricks on women.</p>

<p>I remember Mother telling Dora and me when we were little that you
ought to be very kind and polite to servants, because they have to
work very hard, and do not have so many good times as we do.  I
used to think about Mother more at the Moat House than I did at
Blackheath, especially in the garden.  She was very fond of
flowers, and she used to tell us about the big garden where she
used to live; and I remember Dora and I helped her to plant seeds. 
But it is no use wishing.  She would have liked that garden,
though.</p>

<p>The girls and the white mice did not do anything boldly
wicked - though of course they used to borrow Mrs Pettigrew's
needles, which made her very nasty.  Needles that are borrowed
might just as well be stolen.  But I say no more.</p>

<p>I have only told you these things to show the kind of events which
occurred on the days I don't tell you about.  On the whole, we had
an excellent time.</p>

<p>It was on the day we had the pillow-fight that we went for the long
walk.  Not the Pilgrimage - that is another story.  We did not mean
to have a pillow-fight.  It is not usual to have them after
breakfast, but Oswald had come up to get his knife out of the
pocket of his Etons, to cut some wire we were making rabbit snares
of.  It is a very good knife, with a file in it, as well as a
corkscrew and other things - and he did not come down at once,
because he was detained by having to make an apple-pie bed for
Dicky.  Dicky came up after him to see what he was up to, and when
he did see he buzzed a pillow at Oswald, and the fight began.  The
others, hearing the noise of battle from afar, hastened to the
field of action, all except Dora, who couldn't because of being
laid up with her foot, and Daisy, because she is a little afraid of
us still, when we are all together.  She thinks we are rough.  This
comes of having only one brother.</p>

<p>Well, the fight was a very fine one.  Alice backed me up, and Noel
and H. O. backed Dicky, and Denny heaved a pillow or two; but he
cannot shy straight, so I don't know which side he was on.</p>

<p>And just as the battle raged most fiercely, Mrs Pettigrew came in
and snatched the pillows away, and shook those of the warriors who
were small enough for it.  SHE was rough if you like.  She also
used language I should have thought she would be above.  She said,
 Drat you!' and 'Drabbit you!' The last is a thing I have never
heard said before.  She said - </p>

<p>'There's no peace of your life with you children.  Drat your
antics!  And that poor, dear, patient gentleman right underneath,
with his headache and his handwriting: and you rampaging about over
his head like young bull-calves.  I wonder you haven't more sense,
a great girl like you.'</p>

<p>She said this to Alice, and Alice answered gently, as we are told
to do - </p>

<p>'I really am awfully sorry; we forgot about the headache.  Don't be
cross, Mrs Pettigrew; we didn't mean to; we didn't think.'</p>

<p>'You never do,' she said, and her voice, though grumpy, was no
longer violent.  'Why on earth you can't take yourselves off for
the day I don't know.'</p>

<p>We all said, 'But may we?'</p>

<p>She said, 'Of course you may.  Now put on your boots and go for a
good long walk.  And I'll tell you what - I'll put you up a snack,
and you can have an egg to your tea to make up for missing your
dinner.  Now don't go clattering about the stairs and passages,
there's good children.  See if you can't be quiet this once, and
give the good gentleman a chance with his copying.'</p>

<p>She went off.  Her bark is worse than her bite.  She does not
understand anything about writing books, though.  She thinks
Albert's uncle copies things out of printed books, when he is
really writing new ones.  I wonder how she thinks printed books get
made first of all.  Many servants are like this.</p>

<p>She gave us the 'snack' in a basket, and sixpence to buy milk with.
She said any of the farms would let us have it, only most likely it
would be skim.  We thanked her politely, and she hurried us out of
the front door as if we'd been chickens on a pansy bed.</p>

<p>(I did not know till after I had left the farm gate open, and the
hens had got into the garden, that these feathered bipeds display
a great partiality for the young buds of plants of the genus viola,
to which they are extremely destructive.  I was told that by the
gardener.  I looked it up in the gardening book afterwards to be
sure he was right.  You do learn a lot of things in the country.)</p>

<p>We went through the garden as far as the church, and then we rested
a bit in the porch, and just looked into the basket to see what the
'snack' was.  It proved to be sausage rolls and queen cakes, and a
Lent pie in a round tin dish, and some hard-boiled eggs, and some
apples.  We all ate the apples at once, so as not to have to carry
them about with us.  The churchyard smells awfully good.  It is the
wild thyme that grows on the graves.  This is another thing we did
not know before we came into the country.</p>

<p>Then the door of the church tower was ajar, and we all went up; it
had always been locked before when we had tried it.</p>

<p>We saw the ringers' loft where the ends of the bellropes hang down
with long, furry handles to them like great caterpillars, some red,
and some blue and white, but we did not pull them.  And then we
went up to where the bells are, very big and dusty among large
dirty beams; and four windows with no glass, only shutters like
Venetian blinds, but they won't pull up.  There were heaps of
straws and sticks on the window ledges.  We think they were owls'
nests, but we did not see any owls.</p>

<p>Then the tower stairs got very narrow and dark, and we went on up,
and we came to a door and opened it suddenly, and it was like being
hit in the face, the light was so sudden.  And there we were on the
top of the tower, which is flat, and people have cut their names on
it, and a turret at one corner, and a low wall all round, up and
down, like castle battlements.  And we looked down and saw the roof
of the church, and the leads, and the churchyard, and our garden,
and the Moat House, and the farm, and Mrs Simpkins's cottage,
looking very small, and other farms looking like toy things out of
boxes, and we saw corn-fields and meadows and pastures.  A pasture
is not the same thing as a meadow, whatever you may think.  And we
saw the tops of trees and hedges, looking like the map of the
United States, and villages, and a tower that did not look very far
away standing by itself on the top of a hill.  Alice pointed to it,
and said - </p>

<p>'What's that?'</p>

<p>'It's not a church,' said Noel, 'because there's no churchyard. 
Perhaps it's a tower of mystery that covers the entrance to a
subterranean vault with treasure in it.'</p>

<p>Dicky said, 'Subterranean fiddlestick!' and 'A waterworks, more
likely.'</p>

<p>Alice thought perhaps it was a ruined castle, and the rest of its
crumbling walls were concealed by ivy, the growth of years.</p>

<p>Oswald could not make his mind up what it was, so he said, 'Let's
go and see!  We may as well go there as anywhere.'</p>

<p>So we got down out of the church tower and dusted ourselves, and
set out.</p>

<p>The Tower of Mystery showed quite plainly from the road, now that
we knew where to look for it, because it was on the top of a hill. 
We began to walk.  But the tower did not seem to get any nearer. 
And it was very hot.</p>

<p>So we sat down in a meadow where there was a stream in the ditch
and ate the 'snack'.  We drank the pure water from the brook out of
our hands, because there was no farm to get milk at just there, and
it was too much fag to look for one - and, besides, we thought we
might as well save the sixpence.</p>

<p>Then we started again, and still the tower looked as far off as
ever.  Denny began to drag his feet, though he had brought a
walking-stick which none of the rest of us had, and said - </p>

<p>'I wish a cart would come along.  We might get a lift.'</p>

<p>He knew all about getting lifts, of course, from having been in the
country before.  He is not quite the white mouse we took him for at
first.  Of course when you live in Lewisham or Blackheath you learn
other things.  If you asked for a lift in Lewisham, High Street,
your only reply would be jeers.  We sat down on a heap of stones,
and decided that we would ask for a lift from the next cart,
whichever way it was going.  It was while we were waiting that
Oswald found out about plantain seeds being good to eat.</p>

<p>When the sound of wheels came we remarked with joy that the cart
was going towards the Tower of Mystery.  It was a cart a man was
going to fetch a pig home in.  Denny said - </p>

<p>'I say, you might give us a lift.  Will you?'</p>

<p>The man who was going for the pig said - </p>

<p>'What, all that little lot?' but he winked at Alice, and we saw
that he meant to aid us on our way.  So we climbed up, and he
whipped up the horse and asked us where we were going.  He was a
kindly old man, with a face like a walnut shell, and white hair and
beard like a jack-in-the-box.</p>

<p>'We want to get to the tower,' Alice said.  'Is it a ruin, or not?'</p>

<p>'It ain't no ruin,' the man said; 'no fear of that!  The man wot
built it he left so much a year to be spent on repairing of it!
Money that might have put bread in honest folks' mouths.'</p>

<p>We asked was it a church then, or not.</p>

<p>'Church?' he said.  'Not it.  It's more of a tombstone, from all I
can make out.  They do say there was a curse on him that built it,
and he wasn't to rest in earth or sea.  So he's buried half-way up
the tower - if you can call it buried.'</p>

<p>'Can you go up it?' Oswald asked.</p>

<p>'Lord love you! yes; a fine view from the top they say.  I've never
been up myself, though I've lived in sight of it, boy and man,
these sixty-three years come harvest.'</p>

<p>Alice asked whether you had to go past the dead and buried person
to get to the top of the tower, and could you see the coffin.</p>

<p>'No, no,' the man said; 'that's all hid away behind a slab of
stone, that is, with reading on it.  You've no call to be afraid,
missy.  It's daylight all the way up.  But I wouldn't go there
after dark, so I wouldn't.  It's always open, day and night, and
they say tramps sleep there now and again.  Anyone who likes can
sleep there, but it wouldn't be me.'</p>

<p>We thought that it would not be us either, but we wanted to go more
than ever, especially when the man said - </p>

<p>'My own great-uncle of the mother's side, he was one of the masons
that set up the stone slab.  Before then it was thick glass, and
you could see the dead man lying inside, as he'd left it in his
will.  He was lying there in a glass coffin with his best
clothes - blue satin and silver, my uncle said, such as was all the
go in his day, with his wig on, and his sword beside him, what he
used to wear.  My uncle said his hair had grown out from under his
wig, and his beard was down to the toes of him.  My uncle he always
upheld that that dead man was no deader than you and me, but was in
a sort of fit, a transit, I think they call it, and looked for him
to waken into life again some day.  But the doctor said not.  It
was only something done to him like Pharaoh in the Bible afore he
was buried.'</p>

<p>Alice whispered to Oswald that we should be late for tea, and
wouldn't it be better to go back now directly.  But he said - </p>

<p>'If you're afraid, say so; and you needn't come in anyway - but I'm
going on.'</p>

<p>The man who was going for the pig put us down at a gate quite near
the tower - at least it looked so until we began to walk again.  We
thanked him, and he said - </p>

<p>'Quite welcome,' and drove off.</p>

<p>We were rather quiet going through the wood.  What we had heard
made us very anxious to see the tower -  all except Alice, who would
keep talking about tea, though not a greedy girl by nature.  None
of the others encouraged her, but Oswald thought himself that we
had better be home before dark.</p>

<p>As we went up the path through the wood we saw a poor wayfarer with
dusty bare feet sitting on the bank.</p>

<p>He stopped us and said he was a sailor, and asked for a trifle to
help him to get back to his ship.</p>

<p>I did not like the look of him much myself, but Alice said, 'Oh,
the poor man, do let's help him, Oswald.'  So we held a hurried
council, and decided to give him the milk sixpence.  Oswald had it
in his purse, and he had to empty the purse into his hand to find
the sixpence, for that was not all the money he had, by any means. 
Noel said afterwards that he saw the wayfarer's eyes fastened
greedily upon the shining pieces as Oswald returned them to his
purse.  Oswald has to own that he purposely let the man see that he
had more money, so that the man might not feel shy about accepting
so large a sum as sixpence.</p>

<p>The man blessed our kind hearts and we went on.</p>

<p>The sun was shining very brightly, and the Tower of Mystery did not
look at all like a tomb when we got to it.  The bottom Storey was
on arches, all open, and ferns and things grew underneath.  There
was a round stone stair going up in the middle.  Alice began to
gather ferns while we went up, but when we had called out to her
that it was as the pig-man had said, and daylight all the way up,
she said - </p>

<p>'All right.  I'm not afraid.  I'm only afraid of being late home,'
and came up after us.  And perhaps, though not downright manly
truthfulness, this was as much as you could expect from a girl.</p>

<p>There were holes in the little tower of the staircase to let light
in.  At the top of it was a thick door with iron bolts.  We shot
these back, and it was not fear but caution that made Oswald push
open the door so very slowly and carefully.</p>

<p>Because, of course, a stray dog or cat might have got shut up there
by accident, and it would have startled Alice very much if it had
jumped out on us.</p>

<p>When the door was opened we saw that there was no such thing.  It
was a room with eight sides.  Denny says it is the shape called
octogenarian; because a man named Octagius invented it.  There were
eight large arched windows with no glass, only stone-work, like in
churches.  The room was full of sunshine, and you could see the
blue sky through the windows, but nothing else, because they were
so high up.  It was so bright we began to think the pig-man had
been kidding us.  Under one of the windows was a door.  We went
through, and there was a little passage and then a turret-twisting
stair, like in the church, but quite light with windows.  When we
had gone some way up this, we came to a sort of landing, and there
was a block of stone let into the wall - polished - Denny said it was
Aberdeen graphite, with gold letters cut in it.  It said - </p>

<blockquote><div>'Here lies the body of Mr Richard Ravenal<br />
Born 1720.  Died 1779.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>and a verse of poetry:</p>

<blockquote><div>'Here lie I, between earth and sky,<br />
Think upon me, dear passers -by,<br />
And you who do my tombstone see<br />
Be kind to say a prayer for me.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>'How horrid!' Alice said.  'Do let's get home.'</p>

<p>'We may as well go to the top,' Dicky said, 'just to say we've
been.'</p>

<p>And Alice is no funk - so she agreed; though I could see she did not
like it.</p>

<p>Up at the top it was like the top of the church tower, only
octogenarian in shape, instead of square.</p>

<p>Alice got all right there; because you cannot think much about
ghosts and nonsense when the sun is shining bang down on you at
four o'clock in the afternoon, and you can see red farm-roofs
between the trees, and the safe white roads, with people in carts
like black ants crawling.</p>

<p>It was very jolly, but we felt we ought to be getting back, because
tea is at five, and we could not hope to find lifts both ways.</p>

<p>So we started to go down.  Dicky went first, then Oswald, then
Alice - and H. O. had just stumbled over the top step and saved
himself by Alice's back, which nearly upset Oswald and Dicky, when
the hearts of all stood still, and then went on by leaps and
bounds, like the good work in missionary magazines.</p>

<p>For, down below us, in the tower where the man whose beard grew
down to his toes after he was dead was buried, there was a noise - a
loud noise.  And it was like a door being banged and bolts
fastened.  We tumbled over each other to get back into the open
sunshine on the top of the tower, and Alice's hand got jammed
between the edge of the doorway and H. O.'s boot; it was bruised
black and blue, and another part bled, but she did not notice it
till long after.</p>

<p>We looked at each other, and Oswald said in a firm voice (at least,
I hope it was) - </p>

<p>'What was that?'</p>

<p>'He HAS waked up,' Alice said.  'Oh, I know he has.  Of course
there is a door for him to get out by when he wakes.  He'll come up
here.  I know he will.'</p>

<p>Dicky said, and his voice was not at all firm (I noticed that at
the time), 'It doesn't matter, if he's ALIVE.'</p>

<p>'Unless he's come to life a raving lunatic,' Noel said, and we all
stood with our eyes on the doorway of the turret - and held our
breath to hear.</p>

<p>But there was no more noise.</p>

<p>Then Oswald said - and nobody ever put it in the Golden Deed book,
though they own that it was brave and noble of him - he said - </p>

<p>'Perhaps it was only the wind blowing one of the doors to.  I'll go
down and see, if you will, Dick.'</p>

<p>Dicky only said - </p>

<p>'The wind doesn't shoot bolts.'</p>

<p>'A bolt from the blue,' said Denny to himself, looking up at the
sky.  His father is a sub-editor.  He had gone very red, and he was
holding on to Alice's hand.  Suddenly he stood up quite straight
and said - </p>

<p>'I'm not afraid.  I'll go and see.'</p>

<p>THIS was afterwards put in the Golden Deed book.  It ended in
Oswald and Dicky and Denny going.  Denny went first because he said
he would rather -  and Oswald understood this and let him.  If
Oswald had pushed first it would have been like Sir Lancelot
refusing to let a young knight win his spurs.  Oswald took good
care to go second himself, though.  The others never understood
this.  You don't expect it from girls; but I did think father would
have understood without Oswald telling him, which of course he
never could.</p>

<p>We all went slowly.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the turret stairs we stopped short.  Because the
door there was bolted fast and would not yield to shoves, however
desperate and united.</p>

<p>Only now somehow we felt that Mr Richard Ravenal was all right and
quiet, but that some one had done it for a lark, or perhaps not
known about anyone being up there.  So we rushed up, and Oswald
told the others in a few hasty but well-chosen words, and we all
leaned over between the battlements, and shouted, 'Hi! you there!'</p>

<p>Then from under the arches of the quite-downstairs part of the
tower a figure came forth - and it was the sailor who had had our
milk sixpence.  He looked up and he spoke to us.  He did not speak
loud, but he spoke loud enough for us to hear every word quite
plainly.  He said - </p>

<p>'Drop that.'</p>

<p>Oswald said, 'Drop what?'</p>

<p>He said, 'That row.'</p>

<p>Oswald said, 'Why?'</p>

<p>He said, 'Because if you don't I'll come up and make you, and
pretty quick too, so I tell you.'</p>

<p>Dicky said, 'Did you bolt the door?'</p>

<p>The man said, 'I did so, my young cock.'</p>

<p>Alice said - and Oswald wished to goodness she had held her tongue,
because he saw right enough the man was not friendly - 'Oh, do come
and let us out - do, please.'</p>

<p>While she was saying it Oswald suddenly saw that he did not want
the man to come up.  So he scurried down the stairs because he
thought he had seen something on the door on the top side, and sure
enough there were two bolts, and he shot them into their sockets. 
This bold act was not put in the Golden Deed book, because when
Alice wanted to, the others said it was not GOOD of Oswald to think
of this, but only CLEVER.  I think sometimes, in moments of danger
and disaster, it is as good to be clever as it is to be good.  But
Oswald would never demean himself to argue about this.</p>

<p>When he got back the man was still standing staring up.  Alice
said - </p>

<p>'Oh, Oswald, he says he won't let us out unless we give him all our
money.  And we might be here for days and days and all night as
well.  No one knows where we are to come and look for us.  Oh, do
let's give it him ALL.'</p>

<p>She thought the lion of the English nation, which does not know
when it is beaten, would be ramping in her brother's breast.  But
Oswald kept calm.  He said - </p>

<p>'All right,' and he made the others turn out their pockets.  Denny
had a bad shilling, with a head on both sides, and three halfpence.
H. O. had a halfpenny.  Noel had a French penny, which is only good
for chocolate machines at railway stations.  Dicky had
tenpence-halfpenny, and Oswald had a two-shilling piece of his own
that he was saving up to buy a gun with.  Oswald tied the whole lot
up in his handkerchief, and looking over the battlements, he said - </p>

<p>'You are an ungrateful beast.  We gave you sixpence freely of our
own will.'</p>

<p>The man did look a little bit ashamed, but he mumbled something
about having his living to get.  Then Oswald said - </p>

<p>'Here you are.  Catch!' and he flung down the handkerchief with the
money in it.</p>

<p>The man muffed the catch - butter-fingered idiot! -  but he picked up
the handkerchief and undid it, and when he saw what was in it he
swore dreadfully.  The cad!</p>

<p>'Look here,' he called out, 'this won't do, young shaver.  I want
those there shiners I see in your pus!  Chuck 'em along!'</p>

<p>Then Oswald laughed.  He said - </p>

<p>'I shall know you again anywhere, and you'll be put in prison for
this.  Here are the SHINERS.'  And he was so angry he chucked down
purse and all.  The shiners were not real ones, but only
card-counters that looked like sovereigns on one side.  Oswald used
to carry them in his purse so as to look affluent.  He does not do
this now.</p>

<p>When the man had seen what was in the purse he disappeared under
the tower, and Oswald was glad of what he had done about the
bolts - and he hoped they were as strong as the ones on the other
side of the door.</p>

<p>They were.</p>

<p>We heard the man kicking and pounding at the door, and I am not
ashamed to say that we were all holding on to each other very
tight.  I am proud, however, to relate that nobody screamed or
cried.</p>

<p>After what appeared to be long years, the banging stopped, and
presently we saw the brute going away among the trees.  Then Alice
did cry, and I do not blame her.  Then Oswald said - </p>

<p>'It's no use.  Even if he's undone the door, he may be in ambush. 
We must hold on here till somebody comes.'</p>

<p>Then Alice said, speaking chokily because she had not quite done
crying - </p>

<p>'Let's wave a flag.'</p>

<p>By the most fortunate accident she had on one of her Sunday
petticoats, though it was Monday.  This petticoat is white.  She
tore it out at the gathers, and we tied it to Denny's stick, and
took turns to wave it.  We had laughed at his carrying a stick
before, but we were very sorry now that we had done so.</p>

<p>And the tin dish the Lent pie was baked in we polished with our
handkerchiefs, and moved it about in the sun so that the sun might
strike on it and signal our distress to some of the outlying farms.</p>

<p>This was perhaps the most dreadful adventure that had then ever
happened to us.  Even Alice had now stopped thinking of Mr Richard
Ravenal, and thought only of the lurker in ambush.</p>

<p>We all felt our desperate situation keenly.  I must say Denny
behaved like anything but a white mouse.  When it was the others'
turn to wave, he sat on the leads of the tower and held Alice's and
Noel's hands, and said poetry to them - yards and yards of it.  By
some strange fatality it seemed to comfort them.  It wouldn't have
me.</p>

<p>He said 'The Battle of the Baltic', and 'Gray's Elegy', right
through, though I think he got wrong in places, and the 'Revenge',
and Macaulay's thing about Lars Porsena and the Nine Gods.  And
when it was his turn he waved like a man.</p>

<p>I will try not to call him a white mouse any more.  He was a brick
that day, and no mouse.</p>

<p>The sun was low in the heavens, and we were sick of waving and very
hungry, when we saw a cart in the road below.  We waved like mad,
and shouted, and Denny screamed exactly like a railway whistle, a
thing none of us had known before that he could do.</p>

<p>And the cart stopped.  And presently we saw a figure with a white
beard among the trees.  It was our Pig-man.</p>

<p>We bellowed the awful truth to him, and when he had taken it in - he
thought at first we were kidding -  he came up and let us out.</p>

<p>He had got the pig; luckily it was a very small one -  and we were
not particular.  Denny and Alice sat on the front of the cart with
the Pig-man, and the rest of us got in with the pig, and the man
drove us right home.  You may think we talked it over on the way. 
Not us.  We went to sleep, among the pig, and before long the
Pig-man stopped and got us to make room for Alice and Denny.  There
was a net over the cart.  I never was so sleepy in my life, though
it was not more than bedtime.</p>

<p>Generally, after anything exciting, you are punished - but this
could not be, because we had only gone for a walk, exactly as we
were told.</p>

<p>There was a new rule made, though.  No walks except on the
high-roads, and we were always to take Pincher and either Lady, the
deer-hound, or Martha, the bulldog.  We generally hate rules, but
we did not mind this one.</p>

<p>Father gave Denny a gold pencil-case because he was first to go
down into the tower.  Oswald does not grudge Denny this, though
some might think he deserved at least a silver one.  But Oswald is
above such paltry jealousies.</p>
