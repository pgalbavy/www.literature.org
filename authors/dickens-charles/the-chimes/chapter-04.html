<p>
Some new remembrance of the ghostly figures in the 
Bell; some faint impression of the ringing of the Chimes; some giddy
 consciousness of having seen the swarm of phantoms
reproduced and reproduced until the recollection of them lost itself
in the confusion of their numbers; some hurried knowledge, how
conveyed to him he knew not, that more years had passed; and Trotty,
with the Spirit of the child attending him, stood looking on at mortal
company. 

<p>Fat company, rosy-cheeked company, comfortable company. They were
but two, but they were red enough for ten. They sat before a bright
fire, with a small low table between them; and unless the fragrance 
of hot tea and muffins lingered longer in that room than in most
others, the table had seen service very lately. But all the cups and
saucers being clean, and in their proper places in the
corner-cupboard; and the brass toasting-fork hanging in its usual nook
and spreading its four idle fingers out as if it wanted to be
measured for a glove; there remained no other visible tokens of the
meal just finished, than such as purred and washed their whiskers in
the person of the basking cat, and glistened in the gracious, not to 
say the greasy, faces of her patrons.  <p>This cosy couple
(married, evidently) had made a fair division of the fire between
them, and sat looking at the glowing sparks that dropped into the
grate; now nodding off into a doze; now waking up again when some hot
fragment, larger than the rest, came rattling down, as if the fire
were coming with it. 

<p>It was in no danger of sudden extinction, however; for it gleamed
not only in the little room, and on the panes of window-glass in the
door, and on the curtain half drawn across them, but in the little
shop beyond. A little shop, quite crammed and choked with the
abundance of its stock; a perfectly voracious little shop, with a maw
as accommodating and full as any shark's. Cheese, butter, firewood,
soap, pickles matches, bacon, table-beer, peg-tops, sweetmeats boys'
kites, bird-seed, cold ham, birch brooms, hearth-stones, salt,
vinegar, blacking, red-herrings, stationery, lard, mushroom-ketchup,
staylaces, loaves of bread, shuttlecocks, eggs, and slate-pencil;
everything was fish that came to the net of this greedy little shop,
and all articles were in its net. How many  other kinds of
petty merchandise were there, it would be difficult to say; but balls
of packthread, ropes of onions, pounds of candles, cabbage-nets, and
brushes, hung in bunches from the ceiling, like extraordinary fruit;
while various odd canisters emitting aromatic smells, established the
veracity of the inscription over the outer door, which informed the
public that the keeper of this little shop was a licensed dealer in 
tea, coffee, tobacco, pepper, and snuff. 

<p>Glancing at such of these articles as were visible in the shining
of the blaze, and the less cheerful radiance of two smoky lamps which
burnt but dimly in the shop itself, as though its plethora sat heavy
on their lungs; and glancing, then, at one of the two faces by the
parlour-fire; Trotty had small difficulty in recognising in the stout
old lady, Mrs. Chickenstalker: always inclined to corpulency, even in
the days when he had known her as established in the general line,
and having a small balance against him in her books. 

<p>The features of her companion were less easy to him. The great
broad chin, with creases in it large  enough to hide a
finger in; the astonished eyes, that seemed to expostulate with
themselves for sinking deeper and deeper into the yielding fat of the
soft face; the nose afflicted with that disordered action of its
functions which is generally termed The Snuffles; the short thick
throat and labouring chest, with other beauties of the like
description; though calculated to impress the memory, Trotty could at
first allot to nobody he had ever known: and yet he had some 
recollection of them too. At length, in Mrs. Chickenstalker's partner
in the general line, and in the crooked and eccentric line of life, he
recognised the former porter of Sir Joseph Bowley; an apoplectic
innocent, who had connected himself in Trotty's mind with Mrs.
Chickenstalker years ago, by giving him admission to the mansion where
he had confessed his obligations to that lady, and drawn on his
unlucky head such grave reproach. 

<p>Trotty had little interest in a change like this, after the changes
he had seen; but association is very strong sometimes; and he looked
involuntarily behind the parlour-door, where the accounts of credit 
 customers were usually kept in chalk. There was no record
of his name. Some names were there, but they were strange to him, and
infinitely fewer than of old; from which he argued that the porter was
an advocate of ready money transactions, and on coming into the
business had looked pretty sharp after the Chickenstalker defaulters. 

<p>So desolate was Trotty, and so mournful for the youth and promise
of his blighted child, that it was a sorrow to him, even to have no
place in Mrs. Chickenstalker's ledger. 

<p>``What sort of a night is it, Anne?'' inquired the former
porter of Sir Joseph Bowley, stretching out his legs before the fire,
and rubbing as much of them as his short arms could reach; with an air
that added, ``Here I am if it's bad, and I don't want to go out if
it's good.'' 

<p>``Blowing and sleeting hard,'' returned his wife; ``and 
threatening snow. Dark. And very cold.'' 

<p>``I'm glad to think we had muffins,'' said the former porter,
in the tone of one who had set his conscience at rest. ``It's a
sort of night that's  meant for muffins. Likewise crumpets.
Also Sally Lunns.'' 

<p>The former porter mentioned each successive kind of eatable, as if
he were musingly summing up his good actions. After which he rubbed
his fat legs as before, and jerking them at the knees to get the fire 
upon the yet unroasted parts, laughed as if somebody had tickled him. 

<p>``You're in spirits, Tugby, my dear,'' observed his wife. 

<p>The firm was Tugby, late Chickenstalker. 

<p>``No,'' said Tugby. ``No. Not particular. I'm a little
elewated. The muffins came so pat!'' 

<p>With that he chuckled until he was black in the face; and had so
much ado to become any other colour, that his fat legs took the
strangest excursions into the air. Nor were they reduced to anything
like decorum until Mrs. Tugby had thumped him violently on the back,
and shaken him as if he were a great bottle. 

<p>``Good gracious, goodness, lord-a-mercy bless and save the
man!'' cried Mrs. Tugby, in great terror. ``What's he
doing?''  <p>Mr. Tugby wiped his eyes, and faintly
repeated, that he found himself a little elewated. 

<p>``Then don't be so again, that's a dear good soul,'' said
Mrs. Tugby, ``if you don't want to frighten me to death, with your
struggling and fighting!'' 

<p>Mr. Tugby said he wouldn't; but his whole existence was a fight, in
which, if any judgment might be founded on the constantly-increasing
shortness of his breath, and the deepening purple of his face, he was 
always getting the worst of it. 

<p>``So it's blowing, and sleeting, and threatening snow; and it's
dark, and very cold, is it, my dear? '' said Mr. Tugby, looking at
the fire, and reverting to the cream and marrow of his temporary
elevation. 

<p>``Hard weather indeed,'' returned his wife, shaking her head.


<p>``Aye, aye! Years,'' said Mr. Tugby, ``are like christians 
in that respect. Some of 'em die hard; some of 'em die easy. This one
hasn't many days to run, and is making a fight for it. I like him all
the better. There's a customer, my love!''  <p>Attentive
to the rattling door, Mrs. Tugby had already risen. 

<p>``Now then!'' said that lady, passing out into the little
shop. ``What's wanted? Oh! I beg your pardon, sir, I'm sure. I
didn't think it was you.'' 

<p>She made this apology to a gentleman in black, who with his
wristbands tucked up, and his hat cocked loungingly on one side, and
his hands in his pockets, sat down astride on the table-beer barrel, 
and nodded in return. 

<p>``This is a bad business up stairs, Mrs. Tugby,'' said the
gentleman. ``The man can't live.'' 

<p>``Not the back-attic can't!'' cried Tugby, coming out into
the shop to join the conference. 

<p>``The back-attic, Mr. Tugby,'' said the gentleman, ``is
coming downstairs fast, and will be below the basement very soon.''


<p>Looking by turns at Tugby and his wife, he sounded the barrel with
his knuckles for the depth of beer, and having found it, played a tune
upon the empty part. 

<p>``The back-attic, Mr. Tugby,'' said the gentleman: 
Tugby having stood in silent consternation for some time: ``is
Going.'' 

<p>``Then,'' said Tugby, turning to his wife, ``he must Go,
you know, before he's Gone.'' 

<p>``I don't think you can move him,'' said the gentleman, 
shaking his head. ``I wouldn't take the responsibility of saying it
could be done, myself. You had better leave him where he is. He can't
live long.'' 

<p>``It's the only subject,'' said Tugby, bringing the 
butter-scale down upon the counter with a crash, by weighing his fist
on it, ``that we've ever had a word upon; she and me; and look what
it comes to! He's going to die here, after all. Going to die upon the 
premises. Going to die in our house!'' 

<p>``And where should he have died, Tugby?'' cried his wife. 

<p>``In the workhouse,'' he returned. ``What are workhouses 
made for?'' 

<p>``Not for that,'' said Mrs. Tugby, with great energy. 
``Not for that! Neither did I marry you for that, Don't think it,
Tugby. I won't have it. I won't. allow it. I'd be separated first, and
never  see your face again. When my widow's name stood over
that door, as it did for many years: this house being known as Mrs.
Chickenstalker's far and wide, and never known but to its honest
credit and its good report: when my widow's name stood over that door,
 Tugby, I knew him as a handsome, steady, manly, independent youth; I
knew her as the sweetest-looking, sweetest-tempered girl, eyes ever
saw; I knew her father (poor old creetur, he fell down from the 
steeple walking in his sleep, and killed himself), for the simplest,
hardest-working, childest-hearted man, that ever drew the breath of
life; and when I turn them out of house and home, may angels turn me
out of Heaven. As they would! And serve me right!'' 

<p>Her old face, which had been a plump and dimpled one before the
changes which had come to pass, seemed to shine out of her as she said
these words; and when she dried her eyes, and shook her head and her
handkerchief at Tugby, with an expression of firmness which it was
quite clear was not to be easily resisted, Trotty said ``Bless her!
Bless her!''  <p>Then he listened, with a panting heart,
for what should follow. Knowing nothing yet, but that they spoke of
Meg. 

<p>If Tugby had been a little elevated in the parlour, he more than
balanced that account by being not a little depressed in the shop,
where he now stood staring at his wife, without attempting a reply;
secretly conveying, however -- either in a fit of abstraction or 
as a precautionary measure -- all the money from the till into
his own pockets, as he looked at her. 

<p>The gentleman upon the table-beer cask, who appeared to be some
authorised medical attendant upon the poor, was far too well
accustomed, evidently, to little differences of opinion between man
and wife, to interpose any remark in this instance. He sat softly
whistling, and turning little drops of beer out of the tap upon the
ground, until there was a perfect calm: when he raised his head, and
said to Mrs. Tugby, late Chickenstalker: 

<p>``There's something interesting about the woman, even now. How
did she come to marry him?'' 

<p>``Why that,'' said Mrs. Tugby, taking a seat near 
him, ``is not the least cruel part of her story, sir. You see they
kept company, she and Richard, many years ago. When they were a young
and beautiful couple, everything was settled, and they were to have
been married on a New Year's Day. But, somehow, Richard got it into
his head, through what the gentlemen told him, that he might do
better, and that he'd soon repent it, and that she wasn't good enough
for him, and that a young man of spirit had no business to be
married. And the gentlemen frightened her, and made her melancholy,
and timid of his deserting her, and of her children coming to the
gallows, and of its being wicked to be man and wife, and a good deal 
more of it. And in short, they lingered and lingered, and their trust
in one another was broken, and so at last was the match. But the fault
was his. She would have married him, sir, joyfully. I've seen her 
heart swell, many times afterwards, when he passed her in a proud and
careless way; and never did a woman grieve more truly for a man, that
she for Richard when he first went wrong.'' 

<p>``Oh! he went wrong, did he?'' said the gentleman 
pulling out the vent-peg of the table-beer, and trying to peep down
into the barrel through the hole. 

<p>``Well, Sir, I don't know that he rightly understood himself,
you see. I think his mind was troubled by their having broke with one
another; and that but for being ashamed before the gentlemen, and
perhaps for being uncertain too, how she might take it, he'd have
gone through any suffering or trial to have had Meg's promise and
Meg's hand again. That's my belief. He never said so; more's the pity!
He took to drinking, idling, bad companions: all the fine resources 
that were to be so much better for him than the Home he might have
had. He lost his looks, his character, his health, his strength, his
friends, his work: everything!'' 

<p>``He didn't lose everything, Mrs. Tugby,'' returned the
gentleman, ``because he gained a wife; and I want to know how he
gained her.'' 

<p>``I'm coming to it, sir, in a moment. This went on for years and
years; he sinking lower and lower; she enduring, poor thing, miseries
enough to wear her life away. At last, he was so cast down, and cast
out,  that no one would employ or notice him; and doors were
shut upon him, go where he would. Applying from place to place, and
door to door; and coming for the hundredth time to one gentleman who 
had often and often tried him (he was a good workman to the very end);
that gentleman, who knew his history, said, &onq;I believe you are
incorrigible; there is only one person in the world who has a chance
of reclaiming you; ask me to trust you no more, until she tries to do
it.&cnq; Something like that, in his anger and vexation.'' 

<p>``Ah!'' said the gentleman. ``Well?'' 

<p>``Well, sir, he went to her, and kneeled to her; said it was so:
said it ever had been so; and made a prayer to her to save him.'' 

<p>``And she? -- Don't distress yourself, Mrs. Tugby.'' 

<p>``She came to me that night to ask me about living here.
&onq;What he was once to me,&cnq; she said, &onq;is buried in a grave,
side by side, with what I was to him. But I have thought of this; and
I will make the trial in the hope of saving him; for the love of the
light-hearted girl (you remember her) who was to have been married on
a New Year's Day; and for the love  of her Richard.&cnq; And
she said he had come to her from Lilian, and Lilian had trusted to
him, and she never could forget that. So they were married; and when
they came home here, and I saw them, I hoped that such prophecies as
parted them when they were young, may not often fulfil themselves as
they did in this case, or I wouldn't be the makers of them for a Mine
of Gold.'' 

<p>The gentleman got off the cask, and stretched himself, observing: 

<p>``I suppose he used her ill, as soon as they were married?'' 

<p>``I don't think he ever did that,'' said Mrs. Tugby, shaking
her head, and wiping her eyes. ``He went on better for a short
time; but, his habits were too old and strong to be got rid of; he
soon fell back a little; and was falling fast back, when his illness 
came so strong upon him. I think he has always felt for her. I am sure
he has. I have seen him, in his crying fits and tremblings, try to
kiss her hand; and I have heard him call her &onq;Meg,&cnq; and say it
 was her nineteenth birthday. There he has been lying, now, these <pb
n=151> weeks and months. Between him and her baby, she had not been
able to do her own work; and by not being able to be regular, she has 
lost it, even if she could have done it. How they have lived. I hardly
know!'' 

<p>``<STRONG>I</STRONG> know,'' muttered Mr. Tugby; looking at the
till, and round the shop, and at his wife; and rolling his head with
immense intelligence. ``Like Fighting Cocks!'' 

<p>He was interrupted by a cry -- a sound of lamentation --
from the upper story of the house. The gentleman moved hurriedly to
the door. 

<p>``My friend,'' he said, looking back, ``you needn't 
discuss whether he shall be removed or not. He has spared you that
trouble, I believe.'' 

<p>Saying so, he ran upstairs, followed by Mrs. Tugby; while Mr. Tugby
panted and grumbled after them at leisure: being rendered more than
commonly short-winded by the weight of the till, in which there had 
been an inconvenient quantity of copper. Trotty with the child beside
him, floated up the staircase like mere air. 
<p>``Follow her! Follow her! Follow her! `` He heard the ghostly
voices in the Bells repeat their words as he ascended. ``Learn it,
from the creature dearest to your heart!'' 

<p>It was over. It was over. And this was she, her father's pride and
joy! This haggard, wretched woman, weeping by the bed, if it deserved
that name, and pressing to her breast, and hanging down her head
upon, an infant. Who can tell how spare, how sickly, and how poor an
infant? Who can tell how dear! 

<p>``Thank God!'' cried Trotty, holding up his folded hands.
``Oh, God be thanked! She loves her child!'' 

<p>The gentleman, not otherwise hard-hearted or indifferent to such
scenes, than that he saw them every day, and knew that they were
figures of no moment in the Filer sums -- mere scratches in the
working of these calculations -- laid his hand upon the heart
that beat no more, and listened for the breath, and said, ``His
pain is over. It's better as  it is!'' Mrs. Tugby tried
to comfort her with kindness. Mr. Tugby tried philosophy. 

<p>``Come, come!'' he said, with his hands in his pockets, 
``You mustn't give way, you know. That won't do. You must fight up.
What would have become of me if <STRONG>I</STRONG> had given way when I
was porter, and we had as many as six runaway carriage-doubles at our
door in one night! But, I fell back upon my strength of mind, and
didn't open it!'' 

<p>Again Trotty heard the voices, saying, ``Follow her!'' He
turned towards his guide, and saw it rising from him, passing through
the air. ``Follow her!'' it said. And vanished. 

<p>He hovered round her; sat down at her feet; looked up into her face
for one trace of her old self; listened for one note of her old
pleasant voice. He flitted round the child: so wan, so prematurely
old, so dreadful in its gravity, so plaintive in its feeble, 
mournful, miserable wail. He almost worshipped it. He clung to it as
her only safeguard; as the last unbroken link that bound her to
endurance. He  set his father's hope and trust on the frail
baby; watched her every look upon it as she held it in her arms; and
cried a thousand times, ``She loves it! God be thanked, she loves
it!'' 

<p>He saw the woman tend her in the night; return to her when her
grudging husband was asleep, and all was still; encourage her, shed
tears with her, set nourishment before her. He saw the day come, and 
the night again; the day, the night; the time go by; the house of
death relieved of death; the room left to herself and to the child; he
heard it moan and cry; he saw it harass her, and tire her out, and
when she slumbered in exhaustion, drag her back to consciousness, and
hold her with its little hands upon the rack; but she was constant to
it, gentle with it, patient with it. Patient! Was its loving mother in
her inmost heart and soul, and had its Being knitted up with hers as
when she carried it unborn. 

<p>All this time she was in want: languishing away, in dire and pining
want. With the baby in her arms she wandered here and there, in quest
of occupation; and  with its thin face lying in her lap, and
looking up in hers, did any work for any wretched sum; a day and
night of labour for as many farthings as there were figures on the
dial. If she had quarrelled with it, if she had neglected it; if she
had looked upon it with a moment's hate; if, in the frenzy of an
instant, she had struck it! No. His comfort was, She loved it always.


<p>She told no one of her extremity, and wandered abroad in the day
lest she should be questioned by her only friend: for any help she
received from her hands, occasioned fresh disputes between the good 
woman and her husband; and it was new bitterness to be the daily cause
of strife and discord where she owed so much. 

<p>She loved it still. She loved it more and more But a change fell on
the aspect of her love. One night. 

<p>She was singing faintly to it in its sleep, and walking to and fro
to hush it, when her door was softly opened, and a man looked in. 

<p>``For the last time,'' he said .

<p>``William Fern!'' 

<p>``For the last time.''  <p>He listened like a man
pursued: and spoke in whispers. 

<p>``Margaret, my race is nearly run. I couldn't finish it, without
a parting word with you. Without one grateful word.'' 

<p>``What have you done?'' she asked: regarding him with terror.


<p>He looked at her, but gave no answer. 

<p>After a short silence, he made a gesture with his hand, as if he
set her question by; as if he brushed it aside; and said: 

<p>``It's long ago, Margaret, now; but that night is as fresh in my
memory as ever ``twas. We little thought then,'' he added,
looking round, ``that we should ever meet like this. Your child,
Margaret? Let me have it in my arms. Let me hold your child.'' 

<p>He put his hat upon the floor, and took it. And he trembled as he
took it, from head to foot. 

<p>``Is it a girl?'' 

<p>``Yes.'' 

<p>He put his hand before its little face.  <p>``See how
weak I'm grown, Margaret, when I want the courage to look at it! Let
her be, a moment. I won't hurt her. It's long ago, but -- What's
her name?'' 

<p>``Margaret,'' she answered, quickly. 

<p>``I'm glad of that,'' he said. ``I'm glad of that!'' 

<p>He seemed to breathe more freely; and after pausing for an instant,
took away his hand, and looked upon the infant's face. But covered it
again, immediately. 

<p>``Margaret!'' he said; and gave her back the child. ``It's
Lilian's.'' 

<p>``Lilian's!'' 

<p>``I held the same face in my arms when Lilian's mother died and
left her.'' 

<p>``When Lilian's mother died and left her!'' she repeated, 
wildly. 

<p>``How, shrill you speak! Why do you fix your eyes upon me so?
Margaret!'' 

<p>She sunk down in a chair, and pressed the infant to her breast, and
wept over it. Sometimes, she released it from her embrace, to look
anxiously in its  face: then strained it to her bosom again.
At those times, when she gazed upon it, then it was that something 
fierce and terrible began to mingle with her love. Then it was that
her old father quailed. 

<p>``Follow her! `` was sounded through the house. ``Learn
it, from the creature dearest to your heart!'' 

<p>``Margaret,'' said Fern, bending over her, and kissing her
upon the brow: ``I thank you for the last time. Good-night.
Good-bye! Put your hand in mine; and tell me you'll forget me from
this hour, and try to think the end of me was here.'' 

<p>``What have you done?'' she asked again 

<p>``There'll be a Fire to-night,'' he said, removing from her.
``There'll be Fires this winter-time, to light the dark nights,
East, West, North, and South. When you see the distant sky red,
they'll be blazing. When you see the distant sky red, think of me no
more; or, if you do, remember what a Hell was lighted up inside of
me, and think you see its flames reflected in the clouds. Good night.
Good bye!'' 

<p>She called to him; but he was gone. She sat  down 
stupefied, until her infant roused her to a sense of hunger, cold, and
darkness. She paced the room with it the livelong night, hushing it
and soothing it. She said at intervals, ``Like Lilian, when her
mother died and left her!'' Why was her step so quick, her eye so
wild, her love so fierce and terrible, whenever she repeated those
words? 

<p>``But, it is Love,'' said Trotty. ``It is Love. She'll 
never cease to love it. My poor Meg!'' 

<p>She dressed the child next morning with unusual care -- ah,
vain expenditure of care upon such squalid robes! -- and once
more tried to find some means of life. It was the last day of the Old
Year. She tried till night, and never broke her fast. She tried in 
vain. 

<p>She mingled with an abject crowd, who tarried in the snow, until it
pleased some officer appointed to dispense the public charity (the
lawful charity; not that once preached upon a Mount), to call them in,
 and question them, and say to this one, ``Go to such a place,''
to that one, ``Come next week; '' to make a football of another
wretch, and pass him here and  there, from hand to hand,
from house to house, until he wearied and lay down to die; or started
up and robbed, and so became a higher sort of criminal, whose claims
allowed of no delay. Here, too, she failed. She loved her child, and
wished to have it lying on her breast. And that was quite enough. 

<p>It was night: a bleak, dark, cutting night: when, pressing the
child close to her for warmth, she arrived outside the house she
called her home. She was so faint and giddy, that she saw no one
standing in the doorway until she was close upon it, and about to 
enter. Then she recognised the master of the house, who had so
disposed himself -- with his person it was not difficult --
as to fill up the whole entry. 

<p>``O!'' he said softly. ``You have come back. 

<p>She looked at the child, and shook her head. 

<p>``Don't you think you have lived here long enough without paying
any rent? Don't you think that, without any money, you've been a
pretty constant customer at this shop, now?'' said Mr. Tugby. 

<p>She repeated the same mute appeal. 

<p>``Suppose you try and deal somewhere else, ''  he
sald. ``And suppose you provide yourself with another lodging. 
Come! Don't you think you could manage it?'' 

<p>She said in a low voice, that it was very late. To-morrow. 

<p>``Now I see what you want,'' said Tugby; ``and what you
mean. You know there are two parties in this house about you, and you
delight in setting 'em by the ears. I don't want any quarrels; I'm
speaking softly to avoid a quarrel; but if you dont go away, I'll
speak out loud, and you shall cause words high enough to please you.
But you shan't come in. That I am determined.'' 

<p>She put her hair back with her hand, and looked in a sudden manner
at the sky, and the dark lowering distance. 

<p>``This is the last night of an Old Year, and I won't carry
ill-blood and quarrellings and disturbances into a New One, to please
you nor anybody else,'' said Tugby, who was quite a retail Friend
and Father. . ``I wonder you an't ashamed of yourself, to carry
such practices into a New Year. If you haven't any 
business in the world, but to be always giving way, and always making
disturbances between man and wife, you'd be better out of it. Go along
with you.'' 

<p>``Follow ner! To desperation!'' 

<p>Again the old man heard the voices. Looking up, he saw the figures
hovering in the air, and pointing where she went, down the dark
street. 

<p>``She loves it!'' he exclaimed, in agonised entreaty for her.
``Chimes! she loves it still!'' 

<p>``Follow her!'' The shadows swept upon the track she had
taken, like a cloud. 

<p>He joined in the pursuit; he kept close to her; he looked into her
face. He saw the same fierce and terrible expression mingling with her
love, and kindling in her eyes. He heard her say, ``Like Lilian! To
 be changed like Lilian!'' and her speed redoubled. 

<p>Oh, for something to awaken her! For any sight, or sound, or scent,
to call up tender recollections in a brain on fire! For any gentle
image of the Past, to rise before her! 

<p>``I was her father! I was her father!'' cried the 
old man, stretching out his hands to the dark shadows flying on
above. ``Have mercy on her, and on me! Where does she go? Turn her
back! I was her father!'' 

<p>But they only pointed to her, as she hurried on; and said, ``To
desperation! Learn it from the creature dearest to your heart!'' 

<p>A hundred voices echoed it. The air was made of breath expended in
those words. He seemed to take them in, at every gasp he drew. They
were everywhere, and not to be escaped. And still she hurried on; the
same light in her eyes, the same words in her mouth, ``Like Lilian!
To be changed like Lilian!'' 

<p>All at once she stopped. 

<p>``Now, turn her back!'' exclaimed the old man, tearing his
white hair. ``My child! Meg! Turn her back! Great Father, turn her
back!'' 

<p>In her own scanty shawl, she wrapped the baby warm. With her
fevered hands, she smoothed its limbs, composed its face, arranged its
mean attire. In her wasted arms she folded it, as though she never 
 would resign it more. And with her dry lips, kissed it in a
final pang, and last long agony of Love. 

<p>Putting its tiny hand up to her neck, and holding it there, within
her dress, next to her distracted heart, she set its sleeping face
against her: closely, steadily, against her: and sped onward to the
River. 

<p>To the rolling River, swift and dim, where Winter Night sat
brooding like the last dark thoughts of many who had sought a refuge
there before her. Where scattered lights upon the banks gleamed
sullen, red, and dull, as torches that were burning there, to show
the way to Death. Where no abode of living people casts its shadow, on
the deep, impenetrable, melancholy shade. 

<p>To the River! To that portal of Eternity, her desperate footsteps
tended with the swiftness of its rapid waters running to the sea. He
tried to touch her as she passed him, going down to its dark level; 
but, the wild distempered form, the fierce and terrible love, the
desperation that had left all human check or hold behind, swept by him
like the wind. 

<p>He followed her. She paused a moment on the  brink,
before the dreadful plunge. He fell down on his knees, and in a shriek
addressed the figures in the Bells now hovering above them. 

<p>``I have learnt it!'' cried the old man. ``From the 
creature dearest to my heart! Oh, save her, save her!'' 

<p>He could wind his fingers in her dress; could hold it! As the words
escaped his lips, he felt his sense of touch return, and knew that he
had detained her. 

<p>The figures looked down steadfastly upon him 

<p>``I have learnt it!'' cried the old man. ``Oh, have mercy
on me in this hour, if, in my love for her, so young and good, I
slandered Nature in the breasts of mothers rendered desperate! Pity my
presumption, wickedness, and ignorance, and save her.'' 

<p>He felt his hold relaxing. They were silent still. 

<p>``Have mercy on her!'' he exclaimed, ``as one in whom this
dreadful crime has sprung from Love perverted; from the strongest,
deepest Love we fallen creatures know! Think what her misery must have
been, when such seed bears such fruit! Heaven  meant her to
be Good. There is no loving mother on the earth who might not come to
this, if such a life had gone before. Oh, have mercy on my child, who,
even at this pass means mercy to her own, and dies herself, and perils
 her Immortal Soul, to save it!'' 

<p>She was in his arms. He held her now. His strength was like a
giant's. 

<p>``I see the Spirit of the Chimes among you!'' cried the old
man, singling out the child, and speaking in some inspiration, which
their looks conveyed to him. ``I know that our Inheritance is held
in store for us by Time. I know there is a Sea of Time to rise one
day, before which all who wrong us or oppress us will be swept away
like leaves. I see it, on the flow! I know that we must trust and
hope, and neither doubt ourselves, nor doubt the Good in one another.
I have learnt it from the creature dearest to my heart. I clasp her
in my arms again. O Spirits, merciful and good, I take your lesson to
my breast along with her! O Spirits, merciful and good, I am
grateful!'' 

<p>He might have said more; but, the Bells, the old familiar Bells,
his own dear, constant, steady friends,  the Chimes, began
to ring the joy-peals for a New Year: so lustily, so merrily, so
happily, so gaily, that he leapt to his feet, and broke the spell
that bound him. 

<div> <p>``And whatever you do, father,'' said
Meg, ``don't eat tripe again, without asking some doctor whether 
it's likely to agree with you; for how you <STRONG>have</STRONG> been 
going on, Good gracious!'' 

<p>She was working with her needle, at the little table by the fire:
dressing her simple gown with ribbons for her wedding. So quietly
happy, so blooming and youthful, so full of beautiful promise, that he
uttered a great cry as if it were An Angel in his house; then flew to
clasp her in his arms. 

<p>But he caught his feet in the newspaper, which had fallen on the
hearth; and somebody came rushing in between them. 

<p>``No!'' cried the voice of this same somebody; a generous and
jolly voice it was! ``Not even you. Not even you. The first kiss of
Meg in the New  Year is mine. Mine! I have been waiting
outside the house, this hour, to hear the Bells and claim it. Meg, my
precious prize, a happy year! A life of happy years, my darling
wife!'' 

<p>And Richard smothered her with kisses. 

<p>You never in all your life saw anything like Trotty after this. I
don't care where you have lived or what you have seen; you never in
all your life saw anything at all approaching him! He sat down in his 
chair and beat his knees and cried; he sat down in his chair and beat
his knees and laughed; he sat down in his chair and beat his knees and
laughed and cried together; he got out of his chair and hugged Meg; 
he got out of his chair and hugged Richard; he got out of his chair
and hugged them both at once; he kept running up to Meg, and squeezing
her fresh face between his hands and kissing it, going from her 
backwards not to lose sight of it, and running up again like a figure
in a magic lantern; and whatever he did, he was constantly sitting
himself down in this chair, and never stopping in it for one single
moment; being -- that's the truth -- beside himself with
joy. 

 <p>``And to-morrow's your your wedding-day, my Pet!''
 cried Trotty. ``Your real, happy wedding-day!'' 

<p>``To-day!'' cried Richard, shaking hands with him 
``To-day. The Chimes are ringing in the New Year. Hear them!'' 

<p>They <emph rend=sc>were</STRONG> ringing! Bless their sturdy hearts 
they <emph rend=sc>were</STRONG> ringing! Great Bells as they were;
melodious, deep-mouthed, noble Bells; cast in no common metal; made
by no common founder; when had they ever Chimed like that, before! 

<p>``But, to-day, my pet,'' said Trotty. ``You and Richard 
had some words to-day.'' 

<p>``Because he's such a bad fellow, father,'' said Meg 
``An't you, Richard! Such a headstrong, violent man! He'd have made
no more of speaking his mind to that great Alderman, and putting
<STRONG>him</STRONG> down I don't know where, than he would of
--'' 

<p>``-- Kissing Meg,'' suggested Richard. Doing it too! 

<p>``No. Not a bit more,'' said Meg. ``But I wouldn't let
him, father. Where would have been the use!'' 

 <p>``Richard my boy!'' cried Trotty. ``You was
turned up Trumps originally; and Trumps you must be, till you die!
But, you were crying by the fire to-night my pet, when I came home!
Why did you cry by the fire?'' 

<p>``I was thinking of the years we've passed together father. Only
that. And thinking that you might miss me, and be lonely.'' 

<p>Trotty was backing off to that extraordinary chair again, when the
child who had been awakened by the noise, came running in
half-dressed. 

<p>``Why, here she is!'' cried Trotty, catching her up. 
``Here's little Lilian! Ha ha ha! Here we are and here we go! Oh
here we are and here we go again! And here we are and here we go! And
Uncle Will too!'' Stopping in his trot to greet him heartily.
``Oh, Uncle Will, the vision that I've had to-night, through 
lodging you! Oh, Uncle Will, the obligations that you've laid me
under, by your coming, my good friend!'' 

<p>Before Will Fern could make the least reply, a Band of Music burst
into the room attended by a  lot of neighbours, screaming
``A Happy New Year, Meg!'' ``A Happy Wedding!'' ``Many
of 'em!'' and other fragmentary good wishes of that sort. The Drum
(who was a private friend of Trotty's) then stepped forward and said:


<p>``Trotty Veck, my boy! It's got about, that your daughter is
going to be married to-morrow. There an't a soul that knows you that
don't wish you well, or that knows her and don't wish her well. Or
that knows you both, and don't wish you both all the happiness the
New Year can bring. And here we are, to play it in and dance it in,
accordingly.'' 

<p>Which was received with a general shout. The Drum was rather drunk,
by-the-bye; but never mind. 

<p>``What a happiness it is, I'm sure,'' said Trotty, ``to be
so esteemed! How kind and neighbourly you are; It's all along of my
dear daughter. She deserves it!'' 

<p>They were ready for a dance in half a second (Meg and Richard at
the top); and the Drum was on the very brink of leathering away with
all his power; when a combination of prodigious sounds was heard 
outside,  and a good-humoured comely woman of some fifty
years of age, or thereabouts, came running in, attended by a man
bearing a stone pitcher of terrific size, and closely followed by the
marrow-bones and cleavers, and the bells; not <STRONG>the</STRONG> Bells,
but a portable collection, on a frame. 

<p>Trotty said, ``It's Mrs. Chickenstalker!'' And sat down and
beat his knees again. 

<p>``Married, and not tell me, Meg!'' cried the good woman
``Never! I couldn't rest on the last night of the Old Year without
coming to wish you joy. I couldn't have done it, Meg. Not if I had
been bedridden. So here I am; and as it's New Year's Eve, and the Eve
of your wedding too, my dear I had a little flip made, and brought it
with me.'' 

<p>Mrs. Chickenstalker's notion of a little flip, did honour to her
character. The pitcher steamed and smoked and reeked like a volcano;
and the man who had carried it, was faint. 

<p>``Mrs. Tugby!'' said Trotty, who had been going round and
round her, in an ecstasy. -- ``I <STRONG>should</STRONG> say 
Chickenstalker -- Bless your heart and soul! A happy 
New Year, and many of 'em! Mrs. Tugby,'' said Trotty when he had
saluted her; -- ``I <STRONG>should</STRONG> say, Chickenstalker
-- This is William Fern and Lilian.'' 

<p>The worthy dame, to his surprise, turned very pale and very red. 

<p>``Not Lilian Fern whose mother died in Dorsetshire!'' said
she. 

<p>Her uncle answered ``Yes,'' and meeting hastily they
exchanged some hurried words together; of which the upshot was, that
Mrs. Chickenstalker shook him by both hands; saluted Trotty on his
cheek again of her own free will; and took the child to her capacious 
breast. 

<p>``Will Fern!'' said Trotty, pulling on his right-hand 
muffler; ``Not the friend that you was hoping to find?'' 

<p>``Aye!'' returned Will, putting a hand on each of Trotty's
shoulders. ``And like to prove a'most as good a friend, if that can
be, as one I found.'' 

<p>``Oh!'' said Trotty. ``Please to play up there. Will you
have the goodness!'' 

<p>To the music of the band, the bells, the marrow-
<illus>bones and cleavers, all at once; and while The Chimes were yet
in lusty operation out of doors; Trotty making Meg and Richard <pb
n=175> second couple, led off Mrs. Chickenstalker down the dance, and
danced it in a step unknown before or since; founded on his own 
peculiar trot. 

<p>Had Trotty dreamed? Or are his joys and sorrows, and the actors in
them, but a dream; himself a dream; the teller of this tale a dreamer,
waking but now? If it be so, oh listener, dear to him in all his
visions, try to bear in mind the stern realities from which these
shadows come; and in your sphere -- none is too wide, and none
too limited for such an end -- endeavour to correct, improve, and
soften them. So may the New Year be a Happy one to You, Happy to many
more whose Happiness depends on You! So may each Year be happier than
the last, and not the meanest of our brethren or sisterhood debarred
their rightful share, in what our Great Creator formed them to enjoy.
