<p>When Tom Gordon comprehended that the two policemen had arrested
him on the charge of stealing a gold watch, he understood the
trick played upon him by the lad who had handed him the timepiece
and then, darted into the alley.</p>

<p>Instead of throwing the property away, as a thief generally does
under such circumstances, the young scamp preferred to get a stranger
into difficulty.</p>

<p>"I didn't take the watch; that boy handed it"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shet up!" broke in the burly officer.</p>

<p>"But let me finish what I want"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shet up! Heavens and earth! have I got to kill you before you
stop that clack of yours?"</p>

<p>The lad saw that the only way to save his crown was to keep quiet,
and he did so, trusting that in some way or other the truth would
become known, the guilty punished, and the innocent allowed to
go free.</p>

<p>One policeman grasped his right and the other his left arm, and
they held on like grim death as they marched off toward the station-house.</p>

<p>Turning the next corner, they entered a still lower part of the
city, where the darkest crimes of humanity are perpetrated.</p>

<p>Within ten feet of where Tom was walking, he saw under the gas-lamp
a poor wretch on the pavement, with two others pounding him.</p>

<p>"Murder! murder!" groaned the victim, with fast-failing strength,
vainly struggling to free himself from his assassins.</p>

<p>Tom paused, expecting the policemen, or at least one of them,
would rush in and save the man.</p>

<p>On the contrary, they strode along as if they were unconscious
of the crime going on right before their eyes.</p>

<p>"They'll kill him," said the horrified boy, "why don't you stop"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shet up!" and down came the club again.</p>

<p>Just then the second policeman added in a severe tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Young man, we know you; we understand the trick you are trying
to play on us; you want us to let go of you and rush in there,
and then you'll skip; we're too old birds to be caught with such
chaff; we are convinced that a bird in the hand is worth two in
the bush, and so, understand, sir, we'll hold on to you!"</p>

<p>But at this juncture, fortunately for the under man, a champion
appeared in the person of an Irishman, who with one blow knocked
the largest of the assailants so violently backward that he turned
a complete reverse somersault, and then lay still several minutes
to try and understand things.</p>

<p>The other assailant was using his boot-heel on the prostrate
man at that moment, when the Hibernian gave him a couple of blows
in lightning-like succession. They landed upon the face of the
coward with a sensation about the same as if a well-shod mule
had planted his two hind feet there.</p>

<p>He, too, collapsed on the instant, and for a considerable time
lost all interest in worldly affairs.</p>

<p>It is hard work to kill a drunken man; and, despite the terrible
beating the victim had suffered, he was scarcely relieved of his
foes when he staggered to his feet.</p>

<p>"I'm obleeged to ye, young man, for assisting me, as ye did"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dry up!" broke in the impatient Hibernian.</p>

<p>"Talk of being obleeged to me, 'cause I interfared. What did
ye let them git ye down fur? That's what I want to know. Git out
wid yees!"</p>

<p>And the disgusted champion turned the other fellow about and
expressed his opinion of him by delivering a kick, which landed
him several feet away.</p>

<p>"That was kind in yees," said the recipient, looking back with
the droll humor of the Irish people. "They did their hammering
in front, while I resave yees in the rear, and I fale as though
they was about equal."</p>

<p>"What's this? what's this?" demanded one of the policemen in
a brisk, business-like tone, swinging his locust, and looking
sharply about him, as if in quest of some desperado upon whom
to vent his wrath.</p>

<p>"It looks as if there was some trouble here."</p>

<p>"It's all done with now," replied the man that had finished it,
and then, recognizing the officer, he extended his hand.</p>

<p>"How are ye, Billy?"</p>

<p>"Hello, Pat, is that you?"</p>

<p>"So it is, me, Patsey McConough, that happened down this way
on the lookout for a wee boy, when I saw two men beating one,
and I jist restored the aquilibrium, as ye may say. But what have
ye there?" asked Patsey, peering through the gloom at the figure
of a boy in the grip of the other policeman.</p>

<p>"A chap that we jerked for picking pockets; we've been shadowing
him for a long time."</p>

<p>The Irishman seemed to suspect the identity of the boy, and,
going forward, he took him by the hand, and asked him how it all
came about.</p>

<p>Tom told the story as it is known to the reader, when Patsey
turned to the policeman.</p>

<p>"There's some mistake here, Billy; that boy never took that watch
&mdash;I'll bet my life on that. I know him, and the story he
tells is the true one, and no mistake."</p>

<p>It didn't take the policeman long to agree with Patsey, and a
satisfactory arrangement was made, by which the faithful guardian
kept the gold timepiece, and the boy was allowed to go free.</p>

<p>"I didn't feel aisy," said Patsey, as he walked off in company
with his young friend, "when I left ye in that place, and I hadn't
been gone long whin I made up me mind to go back and fix it, whither
the boss was mad or no. Whin I arrived the throuble was over,
and ye had started out. I had to guess which way ye wint, but
I seemed to hit it, and I was able to do ye a little hilp."</p>

<p>"That you did, indeed," replied the grateful boy. "I would have
gone to jail but for you."</p>

<p>"Ye same to be a wide-awake boy, and ye kape yer sinses about
ye at all times. Ye are looking for a place to stay?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There isn't much of the night left, but I'll find ye what ye
want."</p>

<p>A couple of blocks farther, Patsey conducted him into just the
house the boy would have picked out for himself, had he been given
a week in which to hunt.</p>

<p>Patsey accompanied Tom to his room, where he gave him some earnest
advice.</p>

<p>"This is a moighty avil village, is New York, and ye had better
get out of the same while ye have the money to do it. It isn't
a good thing for a lad to carry a pistol, but I wish ye to kaap
the one I lint ye as long as ye are in danger, which is loikely
to be all yer life."</p>

<p>"My money is nearly all gone," replied Tom, "and unless I get
at something pretty soon, I shall have to beg. I would go out
of the city to-morrow if I only had Jim."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is as well that ye wait where ye are for a few days
for him, spinding yer laisure in looking for a job. I'm a coochman
in the employ of an old rapscallion of a lawyer, who's stingy
enough to pick the sugar out of the teeth of the flies he cotches
in his sugar-bowl. I darsn't bring ye there, but if the worst
comes and ye haven't anything to ate, I'll fix it some way."</p>

<p>The plan was that Tom should stay in this house, visiting the
other morning and evening in quest of information of Jim, while
the sunlight would be spent in hunting for work.</p>

<p>It would be useless to dwell on the particulars of the several
days which followed. Morning and night Tom went over to the other
saloon and inquired after his missing friend. Each time the bartender
replied he had not seen him, and it was his belief that the boy
had "skipped the town," as he expressed it. The little bundle
containing all of Jim's possessions was given to Tom, who took
it away with him, leaving word where his friend could find him.</p>

<p>Dull, leaden despair filled his heart; and, as he paid his board-bill
each evening, he saw with feelings which can scarcely be pictured,
the steady decrease of his pile, until it was close to the vanishing
point.</p>

<p>Five days had passed since he entered the new hotel, during which
not a word was heard of Jim, nor had he seen anything of his friend
Patsey McConough.</p>

<p>It seemed to the boy that he had tramped New York from one end
to the other in his search for work, and in not a single instance
had he received the slightest encouragement. Two vocations, it
may be said, were open to him from the beginning; they were to
sell newspapers or to black shoes. To one of Tom's education and
former life, it was the most bitter humiliation to contemplate
adopting either of these employments. But the night came when
he felt he must do it or beg.</p>

<p>He naturally preferred the newspaper line to that of polishing
shoes, and he resolve to make his venture early the following
morning.</p>

<p>Tom was unusually strong and active for one of his years, and
he expected to have trouble from the envy of the other boys.</p>

<p>When he purchased his fifty <em>Heralds</em>, long before daylight,
there seemed to be an army of newsboys ahead of him, and he was
looked upon and muttered about in the most threatening manner.</p>

<p>He had scarcely reached the sidewalk when he was set upon by
a couple of vigorous gamins, with the evident intent of discouraging
him in the new business.</p>

<p>The others gathered around to see the fun.</p>

<p>They saw it.</p>

<p>The fiery urchins, though both were as large as, and no doubt
older than, Tom, were literally "nowhere" in the fight.</p>

<p>He conquered them in less than a minute without receiving a scratch,
and then, turning to the crowd, remarked that if there was any
one or two or a dozen there that wanted to tackle him, all they
had to do was to come forward. No one came, and Tom sauntered
off to sell his newspapers.</p>

<p>It was exceedingly distasteful; but he was spurred on by necessity,
and he went at it with the impetuosity of a veteran.</p>

<p>His success was below his expectations.</p>

<p>There seems to be a right way of doing everything, no matter
how insignificant, which can only be learned by practice. Despite
his natural quickness, Tom failed in more than one respect.</p>

<p>He hadn't the right change in several instances, and the men
wouldn't wait while he darted into a store for it, but bought
of some other boy who thrust himself forward. No matter where
he turned, it seemed to the young hero that some more wide-awake
newsboy was ahead of him, leaving only the aftermath for him to
gather.</p>

<p>He boarded several of the crowded street-cars, and was kicked
off one of them because he accidentally trod on a gouty old gentleman's
toes, he being the president of the road.</p>

<p>However, all this, and much more indeed, is the sad accompaniment
of the poor little gamins who fight each other in their strife
as to who shall have the preference in leaving the morning sheet
smoking hot at our doors while we are wrapped in slumber.</p>

<p>After carefully balancing accounts that evening, Tom found he
was exactly seven cents ahead.</p>

<p>On the next day he fell nine cents behind, but on the third there
was exciting war news, and he not only rushed off his usual supply,
and the same number repeated, but he obtained in many instances
fancy prices, and cleared several dollars.</p>

<p>This was encouraging, but the day was marked by the greatest
mortification of his life.</p>

<p>He had rushed in his impetuous manner into a streetcar, when
some one called his name, and he turned about and saw Sam Harper
and his sister, both of whom had been his classmates at the Briggsville
school, and Tom was accustomed to look upon Nellie as a little
above ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>Sam shook hands with Tom, and made some jocose remark about his
new business; but Nellie sneered, and looked out the car window.</p>

<p>A high-spirited lad who has experienced anything like this needs
not to be told that it cuts like a two-edged sword.</p>
