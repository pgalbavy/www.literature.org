		<p>This Hermit good lives in that wood<br />
			Which slopes down to the sea.<br />
			How loudly his sweet voice he rears!<br />
			He loves to talk with marineres<br />
			That come from a far countree.
		</p>
		<p>He kneels at morn and noon and eve--<br />
			He hath a cushion plump:<br />
			It is the moss that wholly hides<br />
			The rotted old oak-stump.
		</p>
		<p>The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,<br />
			"Why this is strange, I trow!<br />
			Where are those lights so many and fair,<br />
			That signal made but now?"
		</p>
		<p>"Strange, by my faith!" the Hermit said--<br />
			"And they answered not our cheer!<br />
			The planks looked warped! and see those sails,<br />
			How thin they are and sere!<br />
			I never saw aught like to them,<br />
			Unless perchance it were
		</p>
		<p>"Brown skeletons of leaves that lag<br />
			My forest-brook along;<br />
			When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,<br />
			And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,<br />
			That eats the she-wolf's young."
		</p>
		<p>"Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look--<br />
			(The Pilot made reply)<br />
			I am a-feared"--"Push on, push on!"<br />
			Said the Hermit cheerily.
		</p>
		<p>The boat came closer to the ship,<br />
			But I nor spake nor stirred;<br />
			The boat came close beneath the ship,<br />
			And straight a sound was heard.
		</p>
		<p>Under the water it rumbled on,<br />
			Still louder and more dread:<br />
			It reached the ship, it split the bay;<br />
			The ship went down like lead.
		</p>
		<p>Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,<br />
			Which sky and ocean smote,<br />
			Like one that hath been seven days drowned<br />
			My body lay afloat;<br />
			But swift as dreams, myself I found<br />
			Within the Pilot's boat.
		</p>
		<p>Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,<br />
			The boat spun round and round;<br />
			And all was still, save that the hill<br />
			Was telling of the sound.
		</p>
		<p>I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked<br />
			And fell down in a fit;<br />
			The holy Hermit raised his eyes,<br />
			And prayed where he did sit.
		</p>
		<p>I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,<br />
			Who now doth crazy go,<br />
			Laughed loud and long, and all the while<br />
			His eyes went to and fro.<br />
			"Ha! ha!" quoth he, "full plain I see,<br />
			The Devil knows how to row."
		</p>
		<p>And now, all in my own countree,<br />
			I stood on the firm land!<br />
			The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,<br />
			And scarcely he could stand.
		</p>
		<p>"O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!"<br />
			The Hermit crossed his brow.<br />
			"Say quick," quoth he, "I bid thee say--<br />
			What manner of man art thou?"
		</p>
		<p>Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched<br />
			With a woeful agony,<br />
			Which forced me to begin my tale;<br />
			And then it left me free.
		</p>
		<p>Since then, at an uncertain hour,<br />
			That agony returns;<br />
			And till my ghastly tale is told,<br />
			This heart within me burns.
		</p>
		<p>I pass, like night, from land to land;<br />
			I have strange power of speech;<br />
			That moment that his face I see,<br />
			I know the man that must hear me:<br />
			To him my tale I teach.
		</p>
		<p>What loud uproar bursts from that door!<br />
			The wedding-guests are there:<br />
			But in the garden-bower the bride<br />
			And bride-maids singing are:<br />
			And hark the little vesper bell,<br />
			Which biddeth me to prayer!
		</p>
		<p>O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been<br />
			Alone on a wide wide sea:<br />
			So lonely 'twas, that God himself<br />
			Scarce seemed there to be.
		</p>
		<p>O sweeter than the marriage-feast,<br />
			'Tis sweeter far to me,<br />
			To walk together to the kirk<br />
			With a goodly company!--
		</p>
		<p>To walk together to the kirk,<br />
			And all together pray,<br />
			While each to his great Father bends,<br />
			Old men, and babes, and loving friends,<br />
			And youths and maidens gay!
		</p>
		<p>Farewell, farewell! but this I tell<br />
			To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!<br />
			He prayeth well, who loveth well<br />
			Both man and bird and beast.
		</p>
		<p>He prayeth best, who loveth best<br />
			All things both great and small;<br />
			For the dear God who loveth us<br />
			He made and loveth all.
		</p>
		<p>The Mariner, whose eye is bright,<br />
			Whose beard with age is hoar,<br />
			Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest<br />
			Turned from the bridegroom's door.
		</p>
		<p>He went like one that hath been stunned,<br />
			And is of sense forlorn:<br />
			A sadder and a wiser man,<br />
			He rose the morrow morn.
