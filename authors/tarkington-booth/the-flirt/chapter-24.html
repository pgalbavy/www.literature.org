<p>Valentine Corliss had nothing to do but to wait for the money
his friend Antonio would send him by cable. His own cable, anticipating
his letter, had been sent yesterday, when he came back to the
hotel, after lunching in the country with Cora.</p>

<p>As he walked down Corliss Street, after his tumultuous interview
with her, he was surprised to find himself physically tremulous:
he had not supposed that an encounter, however violent, with an
angry woman could so upset his nerves. It was no fear of Pryor
which shook him. He knew that Pryor did not mean to cause his
arrest&mdash;certainly not immediately. Of course, Pryor knew that
Cora would tell him. The old fellow's move was a final notification.
It meant: "Get out of town within twenty-four hours." And Corliss
intended to obey. He would have left that evening, indeed, without
the warning; his trunk was packed.</p>

<p>He would miss Cora. He had kept a cool head throughout their
affair until the last; but this morning she had fascinated him:
and he found himself passionately admiring the fury of her. She
had confused him as he had never been confused. He thought he
had tamed her; thought he owned her; and the discovery of this
mistake was what made him regret that she would not come away
with him. Such a flight, until to-day, had been one of his apprehensions:
but now the thought that it was not to be, brought something like
pain. At least, he felt a vacancy; had a sense of something lacking.
She would have been a bright comrade for the voyage; and he thought
of gestures of hers, turns of the head, tricks of the lovely voice;
and sighed.</p>

<p>Of course it was best for him that he could return to his old
trails alone and free; he saw that. Cora would have been a complication
and an embarrassment without predictable end, but she would have
been a rare flame for a while. He wondered what she meant to do;
of course she had a plan. Should he try again, give her another
chance? No; there was one point upon which she had not mystified
him: he knew she really hated him.</p>

<p>. . . The wind was against the smoke that day; and his spirits
rose, as he walked in the brisk air with the rich sky above him.
After all, this venture upon his native purlieus had been fax
from fruitless: he could not have expected to do much better.
He had made his coup; he knew no other who could have done it.
It was a handsome bit of work, in fact, and possible only to a
talented native thoroughly sophisticated in certain foreign subtleties.
He knew himself for a rare combination.</p>

<p>He had a glimmer of Richard Lindley beginning at the beginning
again to build a modest fortune: it was the sort of thing the
Richard Lindleys were made for. Corliss was not troubled. Richard
had disliked him as a boy; did not like him now; but Corliss had
not taken his money out of malice for that. The adventurer was
not revengeful; he was merely impervious.</p>

<p>At the hotel, he learned that Moliterno's cable had not yet arrived;
but he went to an agency of one of the steamship lines and reserved
his passage, and to a railway ticket office and secured a compartment
for himself on an evening train. Then he returned to his room
in the hotel.</p>

<p>The mirror over the mantelpiece, in the front room of his suite,
showed him a fine figure of a man: hale, deep-chested, handsome,
straight and cheerful.</p>

<p>He nodded to it.</p>

<p>"Well, old top," he said, reviewing and summing up his whole
campaign, "not so bad. Not so bad, all in all; not so bad, old
top. Well played indeed!"</p>

<p>At a sound of footsteps approaching his door, he turned in casual
expectancy, thinking it might be a boy to notify him that Moliterno's
cable had arrived. But there was no knock, and the door was flung
wide open.</p>

<p>It was Vilas, and he had his gun with him this time. He had two.</p>

<p>There was a shallow clothes-closet in the wall near the fireplace,
and Corliss ran in there; but Vilas began to shoot through the
door.</p>

<p>Mutilated, already a dead man, and knowing it, Corliss came out,
and tried to run into the bedroom. It was no use.</p>

<p>Ray saved his last shot for himself. It did the work.</p>
