<P>Toward midnight Charles heard a great noise beneath his
window. It arose from blows of hammer and hatchet, clinking
of pincers and cranching of saws.</P>
<P>Lying dressed upon his bed, the noise awoke him with a start
and found a gloomy echo in his heart. He could not endure
it, and sent Parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to
strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one
who had been their king. The sentinel was unwilling to leave
his post, but allowed Parry to pass.</P>
<P>Arriving at the window Parry found an unfinished scaffold,
over which they were nailing a covering of black serge.
Raised to the height of twenty feet, so as to be on a level
with the window, it had two lower stories. Parry, odious as
was this sight to him, sought for those among some eight or
ten workmen who were making the most noise; and fixed on two
men, who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony.</P>
<P>&quot;My friends,&quot; said Parry, mounting the scaffold and standing
beside them, &quot;would you work a little more quietly? The king
wishes to get a sleep.&quot;</P>
<P>One of the two, who was standing up, was of gigantic size
and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall,
whilst the other, kneeling beside him, was collecting the
pieces of stone. The face of the first was lost to Parry in
the darkness; but as the second turned around and placed his
finger on his lips Parry started back in amazement.</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, very well,&quot; said the workman aloud, in excellent
English. &quot;Tell the king that if he sleeps badly to-night he
will sleep better to-morrow night.&quot;</P>
<P>These blunt words, so terrible if taken literally, were
received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter. But
Parry withdrew, thinking he was dreaming.</P>
<P>Charles was impatiently awaiting his return. At the moment
he re-entered, the sentinel who guarded the door put his
head through the opening, curious as to what the king was
doing. The king was lying on his bed, resting on his elbow.
Parry closed the door and approaching the king, his face
radiant with joy:</P>
<P>&quot;Sire,&quot; he said, in a low voice, &quot;do you know who these
workmen are who are making so much noise?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I? No; how would you have me know?&quot;</P>
<P>Parry bent his head and whispered to the king: &quot;It is the
Comte de la Fere and his friends.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Raising my scaffold!&quot; cried the king, astounded.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, and at the same time making a hole in the wall.&quot;</P>
<P>The king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to Heaven;
then leaping down from his bed he went to the window, and
pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures
outside, but in vain.</P>
<P>Parry was not wrong. It was Athos he had recognized, and
Porthos who was boring a hole through the wall.</P>
<P>This hole communicated with a kind of loft  -  the space
between the floor of the king's room and the ceiling of the
one below it. Their plan was to pass through the hole they
were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of
the flooring of the king's room, so as to form a kind of
trap-door.</P>
<P>Through this the king was to escape the next night, and,
hidden by the black covering of the scaffold, was to change
his dress for that of a workman, slip out with his
deliverers, pass the sentinels, who would suspect nothing,
and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at
Greenwich.</P>
<P>Day gilded the tops of the houses. The aperture was finished
and Athos passed through it, carrying the clothes destined
for the king wrapped in black cloth, and the tools with
which he was to open a communication with the king's room.
He had only two hours' work to do to open communication with
the king and, according to the calculations of the four
friends, they had the entire day before them, since, the
executioner being absent, another must be sent for to
Bristol.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan returned to change his workman's clothes for his
chestnut-colored suit, and Porthos to put on his red
doublet. As for Aramis, he went off to the bishop's palace
to see if he could possibly pass in with Juxon to the king's
presence. All three agreed to meet at noon in Whitehall
Place to see how things went on.</P>
<P>Before leaving the scaffold Aramis had approached the
opening where Athos was concealed to tell him that he was
about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the
king.</P>
<P>&quot;Adieu, then, and be of good courage,&quot; said Athos. &quot;Report
to the king the condition of affairs. Say to him that when
he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor,
for then I can continue my work in safety. Try, Aramis, to
keep near the king. Speak loud, very loud, for they will be
listening at the door. If there is a sentinel within the
apartment, kill him without hesitation. If there are two,
let Parry kill one and you the other. If there are three,
let yourself be slain, but save the king.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Be easy,&quot; said Aramis; &quot;I will take two poniards and give
one to Parry. Is that all?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, go; but urge the king strongly not to stand on false
generosity. While you are fighting if there is a fight, he
must flee. The trap once replaced over his head, you being
on the trap, dead or alive, they will need at least ten
minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped. In those
ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will
be saved.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Everything shall be done as you say, Athos. Your hand, for
perhaps we shall not see each other again.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos put his arm around Aramis's neck and embraced him.</P>
<P>&quot;For you,&quot; he said. &quot;Now if I die, say to D'Artagnan that I
love him as a son, and embrace him for me. Embrace also our
good and brave Porthos. Adieu.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Adieu,&quot; said Aramis. &quot;I am as sure now that the king will
be saved as I am sure that I clasp the most loyal hand in
the world.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis parted from Athos, went down from the scaffold in his
turn and took his way to the hotel, whistling the air of a
song in praise of Cromwell. He found the other two friends
sitting at table before a good fire, drinking a bottle of
port and devouring a cold chicken. Porthos was cursing the
infamous parliamentarians; D'Artagnan ate in silence,
revolving in his mind the most audacious plans.</P>
<P>Aramis related what had been agreed upon. D'Artagnan
approved with a movement of the head and Porthos with his
voice.</P>
<P>&quot;Bravo!&quot; he said; &quot;besides, we shall be there at the time of
the flight. What with D'Artagnan, Grimaud and Musqueton, we
can manage to dispatch eight of them. I say nothing about
Blaisois, for he is only fit to hold the horses. Two minutes
a man makes four minutes. Musqueton will lose another,
that's five; and in five minutes we shall have galloped a
quarter of a league.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful, gulped a glass of wine
and changed his clothes.</P>
<P>&quot;Now,&quot; said he, &quot;I'm off to the bishop's. Take care of the
executioner, D'Artagnan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right. Grimaud has relieved Musqueton and has his foot
on the cellar door.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, don't be inactive.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Inactive, my dear fellow! Ask Porthos. I pass my life upon
my legs.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis again presented himself at the bishop's. Juxon
consented the more readily to take him with him, as he would
require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to
communicate. Dressed as Aramis had been the night before,
the bishop got into his carriage, and the former, more
disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his
deacon's dress, got in by his side. The carriage stopped at
the door of the palace.</P>
<P>It was about nine o'clock in the morning.</P>
<P>Nothing was changed. The ante-rooms were still full of
soldiers, the passages still lined by guards. The king was
already sanguine, but when he perceived Aramis his hope
turned to joy. He embraced Juxon and pressed the hand of
Aramis. The bishop affected to speak in a loud voice, before
every one, of their previous interview. The king replied
that the words spoken in that interview had borne their
fruit, and that he desired another under the same
conditions. Juxon turned to those present and begged them to
leave him and his assistant alone with the king. Every one
withdrew. As soon as the door was closed:</P>
<P>&quot;Sire,&quot; said Aramis, speaking rapidly, &quot;you are saved; the
London executioner has vanished. His assistant broke his leg
last night beneath your majesty's window  -  the cry we heard
was his  -  and there is no executioner nearer at hand than
Bristol.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But the Comte de la Fere?&quot; asked the king.</P>
<P>&quot;Two feet below you; take the poker from the fireplace and
strike three times on the floor. He will answer you.&quot;</P>
<P>The king did so, and the moment after, three muffled knocks,
answering the given signal, sounded beneath the floor.</P>
<P>&quot;So,&quot; said Charles, &quot;he who knocks down there  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is the Comte de la Fere, sire,&quot; said Aramis. &quot;He is
preparing a way for your majesty to escape. Parry, for his
part, will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be
opened.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Juxon,&quot; said the king, seizing the bishop's two hands
in his own, &quot;promise that you will pray all your life for
this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your
feet, and for two others also, who, wherever they may be,
are on the watch for my safety.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied Juxon, &quot;you shall be obeyed.&quot;</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the miner underneath was heard working away
incessantly, when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in
the passage. Aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to
stop; the noise came nearer and nearer. It was that of a
number of men steadily approaching. The four men stood
motionless. All eyes were fixed on the door, which opened
slowly and with a kind of solemnity.</P>
<P>A parliamentary officer, clothed in black and with a gravity
that augured ill, entered, bowed to the king, and unfolding
a parchment, read the sentence, as is usually done to
criminals before their execution.</P>
<P>&quot;What is this?&quot; said Aramis to Juxon.</P>
<P>Juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more
than Aramis about it.</P>
<P>&quot;Then it is for to-day?&quot; asked the king.</P>
<P>&quot;Was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this
morning?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then I must die like a common criminal by the hand of the
London executioner?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The London executioner has disappeared, your majesty, but a
man has offered his services instead. The execution will
therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange
your spiritual and temporal affairs.&quot;</P>
<P>A slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion
that Charles evinced, as he learned these tidings. But
Aramis was livid. His heart ceased beating, he closed his
eyes and leaned upon the table. Charles perceived it and
took his hand.</P>
<P>&quot;Come, my friend,&quot; said he, &quot;courage.&quot; Then he turned to the
officer. &quot;Sir, I am ready. There is but little reason why I
should delay you. Firstly, I wish to communicate; secondly,
to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last
time. Will this be permitted me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied the officer, and left the room.</P>
<P>Aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! my lord bishop,&quot; he cried, seizing Juxon's hands,
&quot;where is Providence? where is Providence?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My son,&quot; replied the bishop, with firmness, &quot;you see Him
not, because the passions of the world conceal Him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My son,&quot; said the king to Aramis, &quot;do not take it so to
heart. You ask what God is doing. God beholds your devotion
and my martyrdom, and believe me, both will have their
reward. Ascribe to men, then, what is happening, and not to
God. It is men who drive me to death; it is men who make you
weep.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;yes, you are right. It is men
whom I should hold responsible, and I will hold them
responsible.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Be seated, Juxon,&quot; said the king, falling upon his knees.
&quot;I have now to confess to you. Remain, sir,&quot; he added to
Aramis, who had moved to leave the room. &quot;Remain, Parry. I
have nothing to say that cannot be said before all.&quot;</P>
<P>Juxon sat down, and the king, kneeling humbly before him,
began his confession.</P></div>
