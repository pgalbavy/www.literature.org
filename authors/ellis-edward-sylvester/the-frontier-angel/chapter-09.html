<p>"<em>CONSARN </em>her, I don't care nothin' for her. I was just
fooling; I only got down to see where she had put my rifle. Wonder
where she got it from! She's awful ugly. S'pect Dingle has been
telling her some lies about me. By gracious! if I'd only thought
about her shooting that arrer at me, she'd have cotched it. Wonder
if it would have killed a feller if he'd touched her! I wouldn't
risk it, no how. She is purty&mdash;<em>somewhat</em>. Never mind,
I don't care, though I should like to know who she is. It's time
I was tramping home, or the folks will begin to worry about me!"</p>

<p>Soliloquizing thus, Jenkins took his rifle, which he saw was
still loaded, and once more turned his face homeward. Let us precede
his arrival at the settlement.</p>

<p>Dingle, upon starting, after he deemed it useless to wait for
Jenkins, had made all haste through the wood, and proceeded much
faster than the war-party which started the next day. Nothing
occurred to interrupt his journey, and in due time he made his
appearance before the block-house. He was joyfully welcomed back
by all. The fate of Jenkins was sincerely regretted by every one,
but under the circumstances it could not be helped. He was known
to all, and although from his suspected cowardice he commanded
little respect, his loss was none the less mourned.</p>

<p>"They're paintin' and greasin' themselves, so that they can slip
around easy like, and they're just ready to start agin some settlement.
More than that, boys, they've started afore now, and their faces
are turned this way and you've jest got time to git ready to invite
'em in."</p>

<p>"How many?" inquired the commander of the post.</p>

<p>"Can't tell, but a powerful heap. Howsumever there ain't more
than we can give 'Hail Columbia.' I don't think there'll be any
Shawnees except from the upper town on Mad river. The imps in
the other towns have got enough other deviltry to attend to, and
I s'pect this is a kinder independent affair for the Piqua skunks."</p>

<p>The news of Dingle, as might be expected, occasioned the greatest
excitement throughout the little encampment. The settlers, with
compressed and silent lips, commenced moving the most valuable
part of their furniture into the block-house, while the women,
"whispering with white lips," moved hurriedly about, uttering
their supplications continually.</p>

<p>As for the men in the block-house, they were in the highest of
spirits. It had been a long time since anything had occurred to
break the monotony of their life, and they hailed with delight
the prospect of storms ahead. When one of the men became so boisterous,
that the commander endeavored to check him, by telling him that
the fight would probably be a desperate and bloody one, the fellow
actually sprang off his feet, swung his hat over his head, and
shouted, "Glory!"</p>

<p>Peterson had returned the day before Dingle, but without any
news to alarm the settlement. The Indians in the Sciota valley
were as quiet as usual, and there was no evidence to show that
they intended a hostile expedition. The attack, as said by Dingle,
and also by the Frontier Angel, was most probably contemplated
by those at the Piqua town alone.</p>

<p>After most of the preparations had been completed, Abbot called
Dingle aside, and asked him whether he had learned anything of
McGable.</p>

<p>"He wasn't in that village," he replied.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are sure of it."</p>

<p>"Yes, for I surrounded the village two or three times, and if
he'd have been thar', I'd seen him. I seen the chiefs, and could
have shot any reds I'd been asked to."</p>

<p>"Peterson says he is not in the towns either, which he visited,
for he examined each most thoroughly. How can it be? Where is
he?"</p>

<p>"I've found out that he is at the village at the head of the
Little Miami most of the time. Thar's where he is now, you may
bet a considerable."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he will be with the attacking Indians?"</p>

<p>"P'r'aps so, though it can't be told for a startin thing. I s'pose
you'd like to know where me and Jim are going to catch him. You
needn't think we're going to give it up. We ain't, 'cause we've
set our hearts on it; and as soon as these reds as ar' comin'
here get a little taste of us, the thing's going to be done. 'Cause
why? Dick Dingle and Jim Peterson has said so."</p>

<p>"I hope you will learn of the fate of poor Marian, for I believe
her mother will not live three months longer if you do not. When
she finds out for certain, that her child is dead, and gone to
her rest, she may bear up under this great affliction."</p>

<p>"Hold still a minute," said Dingle, as if a sudden thought had
struck him. "Now there's Frontier Angel; she knows all about the
Injin affairs, and I shouldn't wonder ef she could tell you somethin'
about her. Freeze me to death, why didn't I think of it? I know
she can."</p>

<p>"Frontier Angel, who is she? I have heard her spoken of as an
Indian maiden, of whom nothing is known except that she is one
of the best friends the settlers ever had."</p>

<p>"So she is&mdash;so she is; ef it hadn't been for her two or three
times, thar' would have been some big ha'r raising done by the
reds. She finds out nearly all their deviltry, and she's bound
to let the whites know it."</p>

<p>"Do you know where she is now?"</p>

<p>"Tellin' the settlements to keep their eyes peeled, or maybe
she's gone up to Heaven a little while. You needn't laugh, for
she's a <em>sperit</em>&mdash;she's an angel, sure. Lew Whetzel says
so, and I know she is, too."</p>

<p>"Why do you suppose she is such a being?"</p>

<p>"She's jest like one. She's as purty and as good. No one knows
whar's she has come from, or whar' she goes to. She is allers
alone, and goes about in the night. She ain't afeared of nothin',
while everything is afeared of her."</p>

<p>"How are you going to get, then, the information of which you
speak?"</p>

<p>"Just ax her the next time I see her. She knows me, and we've
often talked together. She come and told me the other night 'bout
the reds comin' down this way, and said I must go up and look
'round."</p>

<p>"Well, Dingle, find out what you can; I've no doubt you will.
Perhaps it is time we separated, as there is enough for all to
do. Mansfield, I believe, wishes to speak with you. Ah! here he
comes."</p>

<p>Mansfield approached. His inquiries at first were the same as
Abbot's, and receiving the same answers, he continued:</p>

<p>"How soon, Dingle, do you suppose the attack will be made?"</p>

<p>"To-night, sir."</p>

<p>"So Peterson said, and I suppose you must be right. You have
no fears of the result?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; the Shawnees always attack in the night-time. I understand
their capers. Ef it wa'n't for Frontier Angel, there would be
a hard scratch, for we wouldn't have been fixed up so snug for
'em. I shouldn't wonder if thar' wa'n't much fight after all,
when they find how things is."</p>

<p>"If they are to attack to-night, they cannot be far off?"</p>

<p>"No; they ain't many miles out of the way. It's now 'bout noon.
They'll send thar' scouts ahead, and when the news reaches them
that they are anxiously expected, they'll hurry up and git along
afore dark."</p>

<p>"What will be their object in doing that?"</p>

<p>"You'll see; they'll hoot and yell, and make speeches to scare
us, and make believe there's a heap of 'em. They'll order us to
surrender, or they'll blow us to flinders. You'll larn sunkthin',
you will. Freeze me to death, if you don't."</p>

<p>The afternoon gradually wore away, and the words of Dingle were
found to be true. Vigilant sentinels were watching every point
in the wood, and, at last, they discovered several Indians reconnoitering
them. Every inhabitant was gathered into the block-house. All
the men fully armed and anxious for the affray. Dingle and Peterson
volunteered to enter the wood and spy out the movements and intentions
of their enemies; but the commander would not permit it. He believed
they could not escape being drawn into ambush, by the outlying
scouts. Besides, he could not see what good could result from
such an attempt. He peremptorily forbade any man recklessly exposing
himself, or to attempt to execute any undertaking without orders.</p>

<p>Near the middle of the afternoon, some six or seven Indians were
continually seen, flitting from tree to tree, and approaching
the settlement as nigh as they dared. They seemed to make no attempt
to conceal themselves, and often boldly exposed themselves upon
the edge of the clearing. They viewed the settlement from every
point possible for them to reach, and could not avoid the discovery
that the whites were abundantly prepared for the assault.</p>

<p>Growing bolder and bolder, at the continued silence within the
block-house, one of the Indians strode fearlessly out into the
clearing, and stepping upon a large stump, shook his hand in a
warning manner toward it. That instant there was the sharp crack
of a rifle, the Indian made a hurried jump from the stump and
hobbled away into the wood. As he did so he could not help hearing
the loud laugh that greeted his exit.</p>

<p>"Guess he run a splinter in his foot!" remarked Peterson, who
had fired the shot.</p>

<p>"Forgot sunkthin', I guess," added Dingle. "Hello! the reds have
come!"</p>

<p>Others were now visible, and the number increasing, the wood
appeared to swarm with them. They passed and repassed, and finally
the majority appeared upon the edge of the clearing. Here they
remained stationary a moment, and then entered the wood again.</p>

<p>"Heavens! there are five hundred of them!" exclaimed Mansfield,
in consternation.</p>

<p>"Git out!" laughed Peterson; "don't you understand that trick?
They're showin' themselves half a dozen times over to scare us
into knocking under. Thar's just 'bout a hundred of 'em, not one
more, and they ain't a little scart themselves."</p>

<p>"Who is at the head of them?"</p>

<p>"Do you see that feller standin' off at one end like? kinder
hid behind that tree?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but he isn't dressed like a chief."</p>

<p>"'Cause he ain't a chief, nohow. Don't you know him?"</p>

<p>"No, I never saw him before."</p>

<p>"I reckon you have. That ar' gentleman is Mr. Thomas McGable,
that you've been wantin' to see so long."</p>

<p>At mention of this notorious renegade's name, there was a sensation
among the whites. Abbot, Mansfield, and others strained to get
a view of him through the loop-holes, and expressions of indignation
were freely made.</p>

<p>"How nice I could pick him off," whispered Peterson to Mansfield,
and he ran his eye along the glistening barrel of his rifle.</p>

<p>"Don't do it&mdash;don't do it," admonished our hero. "Remember your
promise to Abbot."</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid; shootin' would be too good for him. He's
bound to know what the white men think of him afore he dies."</p>

<p>The marching, filing, and counter-marching continued a considerable
time, when the commander within the block-house was heard to say:</p>

<p>"Hello! we're going to hear something."</p>

<p>"Just as I s'pected," said Dingle. "McGable's goin' to exhort
us."</p>

<p>The renegade made his appearance, holding a white handkerchief
suspended on a stick over his head, as a flag of truce. He walked
forward, waving the fluttering signal conspicuously, until about
half way between the forest and the block-house, when he mounted
one of the stumps which were so numerous about him, and then <em>he
made a speech</em>. First, he advised them as a <em>friend</em>
to surrender; demonstrated the utter foolishness of hoping to
resist such an overwhelming force as he had at his back, and pledged
<em>his honor</em> that they should be treated humanely. Warming
with his subject, he informed them what a mighty man he was; what
he had done, and what he would do, and how all white men knew
better than to resist him. If his summons to surrender were not
heeded, he would blow the whole settlement sky-high, and tomahawk
every man, woman, and child!</p>

<p>We regret we have not space to give this remarkable speech <em>verbatim</em>.
It was so long and windy that we feel compelled to be satisfied
with the above synopsis.</p>

<p>After the renegade had finished, he seated himself upon the edge
of the stump, and waited for the commander's answer. The latter,
without keeping him waiting, stepped boldly out upon the platform,
and shouted in a voice, every syllable of which, Jenkins, who
was several miles away in the forest, afterward averred he distinctly
heard:</p>

<p>"Tom McGable! You may attack and be hanged!"</p>
