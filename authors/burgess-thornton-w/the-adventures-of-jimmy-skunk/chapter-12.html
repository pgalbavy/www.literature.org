<p>Jimmy Skunk ambled along down the Lone Little Path through the
Green Forest. He didn't hurry. Jimmy never does hurry. Hurrying
and worrying are two things he leaves for his neighbors. Now and
then Jimmy stopped to turn over a bit of bark or a stick, hoping
to find some fat beetles. But it was plain to see that he had
something besides fat beetles on his mind.</p>

<p>Up the Lone Little Path through the Green Forest shuffled Unc'
Billy Possum. He didn't hurry. It was too warm to hurry. Unlike
Jimmy Skunk, he does hurry sometimes, does Unc' Billy, especially
when he suspects that Bowser the Hound is about. And sometimes
Unc' Billy does worry. You see, there are people who think that
Unc' Billy would make a very good dinner. Unc' Billy doesn't think
he would. Anyway, he has no desire to have the experiment tried.
So occasionally, when he discovers one of these people who think
he would make a good dinner, he worries a little.</p>

<p>But just now Unc' Billy was neither hurrying nor worrying. There
was no need of doing either, and Unc' Billy never does anything
that there is no need of doing. So Unc' Billy shuffled up the
Lone Little Path, and Jimmy Skunk ambled down the Lone Little
Path, and right at a bend in the Lone Little Path they met.</p>

<p>Jimmy Skunk grinned. "Hello, Unc' Billy!" said he. "Have you
seen any fat beetles this morning?"</p>

<p>Unc' Billy grinned. "Good mo'nin', Brer Skunk," he replied. "Ah
can't rightly say Ah have. Ah had it on mah mind to ask yo' the
same thing."</p>

<p>Jimmy sat down and looked at Unc' Billy with twinkling eyes.
His grin grew broader and became a chuckle. "Unc' Billy," said
he, "have you ever in your life combed your hair or brushed your
coat?" You know Unc' Billy usually looks as if every hair was
trying to point in a different direction from every other hair,
while Jimmy Skunk always appears as neat as if he spent half his
time brushing and smoothing his handsome black and white coat.</p>

<p>Unc' Billy's eyes twinkled. "Ah reckons Ah did such a thing once
or twice when Ah was very small, Brer Skunk," said he, without
a trace of a smile. "But it seems to me a powerful waste of time.
Ah have mo' important things to worry about. By the way, Brer
Skunk, did yo' ever run away from anybody in all your life?"</p>

<p>Jimmy looked surprised at the question. He scratched his head
thoughtfully. "Not that I remember of," said he after a little.
"Most folks run away from me," he added with a little throaty
chuckle. "Those who don't run away always are polite and step
aside. It may be that when I was a very little fellow and didn't
know much about the Great World and the people who live in it,
I might have run away from some one, but if I did, I can't remember
it. Why do you ask, Unc' Billy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no reason in particular, Brer Skunk. No reason in particular.
Only Ah wonder sometimes if yo' ever realize how lucky yo' are.
If Ah never had to worry about mah hungry neighbors, Ah reckons
perhaps Ah might brush mah coat oftener." Unc' Billy's eyes twinkled
more than ever.</p>

<p>"Worry," replied Jimmy Skunk sagely, "is the result of being
unprepared. Anybody who is prepared has no occasion to worry.
Just think it over, Unc' Billy."</p>

<p>It was Unc' Billy's turn to scratch his head thoughtfully. "Ah
fear Ah don't quite get your meaning, Brer Skunk," said he.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Unc' Billy, and I'll explain," replied Jimmy.</p>
