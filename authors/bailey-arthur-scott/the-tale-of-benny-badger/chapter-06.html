<p>Mr. Coyote's plan for helping him catch Ground Squirrels did not please
Benny Badger in the least. Up to that time he had always had fair luck
hunting alone. And he said as much to Mr. Coyote, in none too friendly a
tone.
</p>
<p>Though Benny thought he had made his feelings plain enough, it seemed as
if Mr. Coyote couldn't take a hint. So far was he from guessing that
Benny did not care for his scheme that he even suggested that it might
be a good idea if he brought a half dozen of his brothers along with
him. He was very cheerful about the whole affair--was Mr. Coyote.
Indeed, he appeared quite ready to arrange Benny Badger's business,
without ever a "By your leave," or "If you don't mind."
</p><p>But Benny Badger was no person to stand quietly by and let a scamp like
Mr. Coyote spoil his whole life. He shook his head in a most obstinate
fashion, giving his visitor fair warning not to go too far.
</p><p>"For goodness' sake, don't bring any of your brothers here!" Benny
Badger shouted. "I never could stand a crowd of your relations. It's bad
enough to have to listen to your six brothers when they're half a mile
away."
</p><p>Mr. Coyote took no offence at that remark.
</p><p>"Very well!" he replied. "No doubt they'd want to sing if they came here
to help you. And certainly their singing would interfere with your
digging--for of course you'd want to stop and listen to it."
</p><p>Benny Badger's only comment sounded somewhat like "Humph!" But Mr.
Coyote must have thought that Benny agreed with him. At least, he nodded
his head. And he went on to say that he would be glad to help Benny
alone, without calling on his brothers.
</p><p>Benny Badger made no further objection. To be sure, having one of the
Coyote family with him every night would be bad enough. But it was so
much better than having seven of them that he began to feel almost
pleased. Perhaps he was lucky, after all! And besides, he thought that
when Mr. Coyote came to help him catch Ground Squirrels that
good-for-nothing scamp would soon tire of digging.
</p><p>And then a terrible uproar broke the silence. It sounded as if a
hundred wolves--or maybe a thousand dogs--had fallen to quarreling a
mile away, growling and howling in the distance.
</p><p>As soon as he heard the noise Mr. Coyote pricked up his ears and sprang
to his feet. "I must leave you now," he said. "There are my six
brothers! They're going to have a sing. And I promised that I'd join
them. . . . Don't forget!" he added, as he flung a sly smile in Benny
Badger's direction. "I'll be here soon after dark to-morrow night."
</p><p>And the next moment he was gone.
</p><p>Benny Badger stood and watched him as he loped off across the moonlit
plain. And not long afterward a terrific racket--twice as loud as the
one before--made Benny bury his head in the place where he had been
digging.
</p><p>"Mr. Coyote has joined his six brothers," he said to himself.
