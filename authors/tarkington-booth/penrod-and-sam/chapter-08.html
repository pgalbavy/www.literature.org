<p>The two boys shrieked with excitement as they beheld the coincidence
of this strange return. They burst into the stable, making almost
as much noise as Duke, who had become frantic at the invasion.
Sam laid hands upon a rake.</p>

<p>"You get out o' there, you ole horse, you!" he bellowed. "I ain't
afraid to drive him out. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>WAIT </em>a minute!" Penrod shouted. "Wait till I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sam was manfully preparing to enter the stall.</p>

<p>"You hold the doors open," he commanded, "so's they won't blow
shut and keep him in here. I'm goin' to hit him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quee-<em>YUT!" </em>Penrod shouted, grasping the handle of the
rake so that Sam could not use it. "Wait a <em>MINUTE, </em>can't
you?" He turned with ferocious voice and gestures upon Duke. "<em>DUKE!"
</em>And Duke, in spite of his excitement, was so impressed that
he prostrated himself in silence, and then unobtrusively withdrew
from the stable. Penrod ran to the alley doors and closed them.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" Sam protested. "What you goin' to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to keep this horse," said Penrod, whose face showed
the strain of a great idea.</p>

<p>"What <em>FOR</em>?"</p>

<p>"For the reward," said Penrod simply.</p>

<p>Sam sat down in the wheelbarrow and stared at his friend almost
with awe.</p>

<p>"My gracious," he said, "I never thought o' that! How&mdash;how much
do you think we'll get, Penrod?"</p>

<p>Sam's thus admitting himself to a full partnership in the enterprise
met no objection from Penrod, who was absorbed in the contemplation
of Whitey.</p>

<p>"Well," he said judicially, "we might get more and we might get
less."</p>

<p>Sam rose and joined his friend in the doorway opening upon the
two stalls. Whitey had preempted the nearer, and was hungrily
nuzzling the old frayed hollows in the manger.</p>

<p>"Maybe a hunderd dollars&mdash;or sumpthing?" Sam asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>Penrod maintained his composure and repeated the newfound expression
that had sounded well to him a moment before. He recognized it
as a symbol of the non&mdash;committal attitude that makes people looked
up to. "Well"&mdash;he made it slow, and frowned&mdash;"we might get more
and we might get less."</p>

<p>"More'n a hunderd <em>DOLLARS?" </em>Sam gasped.</p>

<p>"Well," said Penrod, "we might get more and we might get less."
This time, however, he felt the need of adding something. He put
a question in an indulgent tone, as though he were inquiring,
not to add to his own information but to discover the extent of
Sam's. "How much do you think horses are worth, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Sam said frankly, and, unconsciously, he added,
"They might be more and they might be less."</p>

<p>"Well, when our ole horse died," Penrod said, "Papa said he wouldn't
taken five hunderd dollars for him. That's how much <em>HORSES
</em>are worth!"</p>

<p>"My gracious!" Sam exclaimed. Then he had a practical afterthought.
"But maybe he was a better horse than this'n. What colour was
he?"</p>

<p>"He was bay. Looky here, Sam"&mdash;and now Penrod's manner changed
from the superior to the eager&mdash;"you look what kind of horses
they have in a circus, and you bet a circus has the <em>BEST </em>horses,
don't it? Well, what kind of horses do they have in a circus?
They have some black and white ones; but the best they have are
white all over. Well, what kind of a horse is this we got here?
He's perty near white right now, and I bet if we washed him off
and got him fixed up nice he <em>WOULD </em>be white. Well, a
bay horse is worth five hunderd dollars, because that's what Papa
said, and this horse&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sam interrupted rather timidly.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he's awful bony, Penrod. You don't guess they'd make any&mdash;"</p>

<p>Penrod laughed contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Bony! All he needs is a little food and he'll fill right up
and look good as ever. You don't know much about horses, Sam,
I expect. Why, <em>OUR </em>ole horse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you expect he's hungry now?" asked Sam, staring at Whitey.</p>

<p>"Let's try him," said Penrod. "Horses like hay and oats the best;
but they'll eat most anything."</p>

<p>"I guess they will. He's tryin' to eat that manger up right now,
and I bet it ain't good for him."</p>

<p>"Come on," said Penrod, closing the door that gave entrance to
the stalls. "We got to get this horse some drinkin'-water and
some good food."</p>

<p>They tried Whitey's appetite first with an autumnal branch that
they wrenched from a hardy maple in the yard. They had seen horses
nibble leaves, and they expected Whitey to nibble the leaves of
this branch; but his ravenous condition did not allow him time
for cool discriminations. Sam poked the branch at him from the
passageway, and Whitey, after one backward movement of alarm,
seized it venomously.</p>

<p>"Here! You stop that!" Sam shouted. "You stop that, you ole horse,
you!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" called Penrod from the hydrant, where he
was filling a bucket. "What's he doin' now?"</p>

<p>"Doin'! He's eatin' the wood part, too! He's chewin' up sticks
as big as baseball bats! He's crazy!"</p>

<p>Penrod rushed to see this sight, and stood aghast.</p>

<p>"Take it away from him, Sam!" he commanded sharply.</p>

<p>"Go on, take it away from him yourself!" was the prompt retort
of his comrade.</p>

<p>"You had no biz'nuss to give it to him," said Penrod. "Anybody
with any sense ought to know it'd make him sick. What'd you want
to go and give it to him for?"</p>

<p>"Well, you didn't say not to."</p>

<p>"Well, what if I didn't? I never said I did, did I? You go on
in that stall and take it away from him."</p>

<p>"<em>YES, I </em>will!" Sam returned bitterly. Then, as Whitey
had dragged the remains of the branch from the manger to the floor
of the stall, Sam scrambled to the top of the manger and looked
over. "There ain't much left to <em>TAKE </em>away! He's swallered
it all except some splinters. Better give him the water to try
and wash it down with." And, as Penrod complied, "My gracious,
look at that horse <em>DRINK</em>!"</p>

<p>They gave Whitey four buckets of water, and then debated the
question of nourishment. Obviously, this horse could not be trusted
with branches, and, after getting their knees black and their
backs sodden, they gave up trying to pull enough grass to sustain
him. Then Penrod remembered that horses like apples, both "cooking-apples"
and "eating-apples", and Sam mentioned the fact that every autumn
his father received a barrel of "cooking-apples" from a cousin
who owned a farm. That barrel was in the Williams' cellar now,
and the cellar was providentially supplied with "outside doors,"
so that it could be visited without going through the house. Sam
and Penrod set forth for the cellar.</p>

<p>They returned to the stable bulging, and, after a discussion
of Whitey's digestion (Sam claiming that eating the core and seeds,
as Whitey did, would grow trees in his inside) they went back
to the cellar for supplies again&mdash;and again. They made six trips,
carrying each time a capacity cargo of apples, and still Whitey
ate in a famished manner. They were afraid to take more apples
from the barrel, which began to show conspicuously the result
of their raids, wherefore Penrod made an unostentatious visit
to the cellar of his own house. From the inside he opened a window
and passed vegetables out to Sam, who placed them in a bucket
and carried them hurriedly to the stable, while Penrod returned
in a casual manner through the house. Of his sang-froid under
a great strain it is sufficient to relate that, in the kitchen,
he said suddenly to Della, the cook, "Oh, look behind you!" and
by the time Della discovered that there was nothing unusual behind
her, Penrod was gone, and a loaf of bread from the kitchen table
was gone with him.</p>

<p>Whitey now ate nine turnips, two heads of lettuce, one cabbage,
eleven raw potatoes and the loaf of bread. He ate the loaf of
bread last and he was a long time about it; so the boys came to
a not unreasonable conclusion.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I guess we got him filled up at last!" said Penrod.
"I bet he wouldn't eat a saucer of ice-cream now, if we'd give
it to him!"</p>

<p>"He looks better to me," said Sam, staring critically at Whitey.
"I think he's kind of begun to fill out some. I expect he must
like us, Penrod; we been doin' a good deal for this horse."</p>

<p>"Well, we got to keep it up," Penrod insisted rather pompously.
"Long as <em>I</em> got charge o' this horse, he's goin' to get
good treatment."</p>

<p>"What we better do now, Penrod?"</p>

<p>Penrod took on the outward signs of deep thought.</p>

<p>"Well, there's plenty to DO, all right. I got to think."</p>

<p>Sam made several suggestions, which Penrod&mdash;maintaining his air
of preoccupation&mdash;dismissed with mere gestures.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>I</em> know!" Sam cried finally. "We ought to wash him
so's he'll look whiter'n what he does now. We can turn the hose
on him across the manger."</p>

<p>"No; not yet," Penrod said. "It's too soon after his meal. You
ought to know that yourself. What we got to do is to make up a
bed for him&mdash;if he wants to lay down or anything."</p>

<p>"Make up a what for him?" Sam echoed, dumfounded. "What you talkin'
about? How can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sawdust," Penrod said. "That's the way the horse we used to
have used to have it. We'll make this horse's bed in the other
stall, and then he can go in there and lay down whenever he wants
to."</p>

<p>"How we goin' to do it?"</p>

<p>"Look, Sam; there's the hole into the sawdust-box! All you got
to do is walk in there with the shovel, stick the shovel in the
hole till it gets full of sawdust, and then sprinkle it around
on the empty stall."</p>

<p>"All <em>I</em> got to do!" Sam cried. "What are you goin' to
do?"</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to be right here," Penrod answered reassuringly. "He
won't kick or anything, and it isn't goin' to take you half a
second to slip around behind him to the other stall."</p>

<p>"What makes you think he won't kick?"</p>

<p>"Well, I <em>KNOW </em>he won't, and, besides, you could hit
him with the shovel if he tried to. Anyhow, I'll be right here,
won't I?"</p>

<p>"I don't care where you are," Sam said earnestly. "What difference
would that make if he ki&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you were goin' right in the stall," Penrod reminded him.
"When he first came in, you were goin' to take the rake and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care if I was," Sam declared. "I was excited then."</p>

<p>"Well, you can get excited now, can't you?" his friend urged.
"You can just as easy get&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a shout from Sam, who was keeping his eye
upon Whitey throughout the discussion.</p>

<p>"Look! Looky there!" And undoubtedly renewing his excitement,
Sam pointed at the long, gaunt head beyond the manger. It was
disappearing from view. "Look!" Sam shouted. "He's layin' down!"</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Penrod, "I guess he's goin' to take a nap.
If he wants to lay down without waitin' for us to get the sawdust
fixed for him, that's his lookout, not ours."</p>

<p>On the contrary, Sam perceived a favourable opportunity for action.</p>

<p>"I just as soon go and make his bed up while he's layin' down,"
he volunteered. "You climb up on the manger and watch him, Penrod,
and I'll sneak in the other stall and fix it all up nice for him,
so's he can go in there any time when he wakes up, and lay down
again, or anything; and if he starts to get up, you holler and
I'll jump out over the other manger."</p>

<p>Accordingly, Penrod established himself in a position to observe
the recumbent figure. Whitey's breathing was rather laboured but
regular, and, as Sam remarked, he looked "better", even in his
slumber. It is not to be doubted that although Whitey was suffering
from a light attack of colic his feelings were in the main those
of contentment. After trouble, he was solaced; after exposure,
he was sheltered; after hunger and thirst, he was fed and watered.
He slept.</p>

<p>The noon whistles blew before Sam's task was finished; but by
the time he departed for lunch there was made a bed of such quality
that Whitey must needs have been a born fault-finder if he complained
of it. The friends parted, each urging the other to be prompt
in returning; but Penrod got into threatening difficulties as
soon as he entered the house.</p>
