<p>Boys and girls are not likely to believe they need any instruction
as to exercise. They are so fond of play that all they ask is
a chance and they will use it to the utmost.</p>

<p>That form of exercise is best which brings most muscles into
action. It should not be too violent nor continued after one is
tired. It should be in the open air, and some kind of game is
preferable because it also engages and interests the mind.</p>

<em>TESTS OF SKILL</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Base-ball, rowing, foot-ball, hare and hounds, skating, lacrosse,
lawn tennis and similar tests of skill have become so popular
in this country that the young need to be restrained from indulging
too much in them. After one's school-days are over and a young
man takes up some sedentary occupation, he should manage to gain
exercise every day.</p>

<p>The gymnasiums afford the best forms of exercise, but boys and
girls can walk, run, and use some of the simpler forms of gymnastics
at their homes. They should make sure they breathe pure air, that
they do not form bad habits, and are regular in everything daily
required of them.</p>

<p>  What form of exercise is best? What should be guarded against?
Where   should it be? What is preferable?</p>

<p>  What games are popular? What should every boy do, after his  
school-days are over?</p>

<p>  What of the gymnasiums? What can be done by all boys and girls?
Of   what should they make sure? </p>
