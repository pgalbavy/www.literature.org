<p>FOR once Bobby Bobolink's heart seemed to come right up into his mouth.
Usually he never let anything dash his high spirits. If matters didn't
go exactly as they should with him he would laugh and say that probably
they would be different to-morrow. And more likely than not he would
burst into the jolliest song he knew. Singing like that always helped
him amazingly, when a good many people would have moped and looked glum.
But now the gloomy warning of Jolly Robin's mournful cousin, the Hermit
Thrush, threw a sudden dread into him.
</p>
<p>"Why"--he asked the Hermit in a quavering voice--"why do you think I'm
likely to explode some day when I'm singing?"
</p><p>"I don't <u>think</u> that. I <u>know</u> it," the Hermit corrected him. "No
bird can crowd one note upon another the way you do without running
a terrible risk. If you don't do differently, some fine day your
wife is going to miss you. And when the neighbors search for you,
and find nothing but a few feathers scattered on the ground, they'll
know what has happened to you."
</p><p>Bobby Bobolink actually began to tremble as the Hermit described the
terrible end that awaited him. He was so alarmed that all he could say
was, "My goodness!"
</p><p>"I thought I ought to tell you," the Hermit went on. "I thought maybe
you didn't understand. And now that you've a wife and children, too,
of course you ought to take care of yourself. You won't want any such
accident to happen to you."
</p><p>"No, indeed!" Bobby Bobolink assured him. "And you must tell me how I
can sing fast--as I always do--and yet do it safely."
</p><p>"Ah!" the Hermit exclaimed. "That can't be done. You must sing more
slowly, as I do. Take plenty of time for every note. And above all,
don't sing very often!"
</p><p>"Oh! I never could sing that way!" Bobby Bobolink cried. "I have to sing
joyful songs. And you know you always sing that kind in quick time."
</p><p>"Pardon me!" said the Hermit, who was a most polite person. "I never
sing joyful songs. So you see you are mistaken."
</p><p>"Well, if you sang the sort I do you'd know that they have to be given
in a lively fashion," Bobby told him. "I don't see how it would be
possible to make a song sound merry if it had to be sung slowly."
</p><p>The Hermit pondered over that speech.
</p><p>"There's only one thing for you to do," he said at last. "You must
select only mournful songs.... You know you sing them in slow time."
</p><p>"Pardon me!" Bobby Bobolink said, for he was determined to be just as
polite as the Hermit. "I never sing mournful songs. So you see you are
mistaken."
</p><p>Now, for some reason the Hermit thought that a rude remark, though it
was quite like one that he had made himself but a few moments before. He
drew himself up stiffly and said that he didn't care to talk with Bobby
Bobolink any further. "You know," he added, "we haven't been
introduced."
</p><p>Somehow that amused Bobby. Before he knew what he was doing he had
laughed aloud. And the moment he laughed he felt so happy once more that
he couldn't help singing. So he started right in the middle of a song,
where it was the liveliest. And finding, when he had finished, that he
hadn't exploded, but felt better for the effort, he never paid any more
heed to the Hermit's solemn warning.
</p><p>As for the Hermit, he went straight off to the other side of Cedar Swamp
to live. He claimed that he simply had to have quiet. And there was no
such thing, with Bobby Bobolink around.
