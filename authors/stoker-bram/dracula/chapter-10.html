LETTER, DR. SEWARD TO HON. ARTHUR HOLMWOOD
<P>
         6 September
<P>

"My dear Art,
<P>
     "My news  today  is not so good.  Lucy this morning had
gone back a bit. There is, however, one good thing which has
arisen from it. Mrs. Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me professionally  about her.  I
took advantage of the opportunity, and told her that my  old
master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to stay
with me, and that I would put her in his  charge  conjointly
with myself.  So now we can come and go without alarming her
unduly, for a shock to her would mean sudden death, and this,
in Lucy's weak condition, might be disastrous to her. We are
hedged in with difficulties, all of us, my poor fellow, but,
please God, we shall come through them all right.  If any need
I shall write, so that, if you do not hear from  me, take it
for granted that I am simply waiting for news, In haste,
<P>
       "Yours ever,"
<P>
       John Seward
<P>

  DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
<P>

<P>
     7 September.--The  first  thing Van Helsing  said to me
when we met at Liverpool Street was, "Have you said anything
to our young friend, to lover of her?"
<P>
     "No," I said.  "I waited till I had seen you, as I said
in my telegram. I wrote him a letter simply telling him that
you were coming, as Miss Westenra was not so well, and that I
should let him know if need be."
<P>
     "Right,  my friend," he said.  "Quite right!  Better he
not know as yet. Perhaps he will never know.  I pray so, but
if it be needed, then he shall know all. And, my good friend
John, let me caution you.  You deal with the madmen. All men
are mad in some way or the other, and inasmuch as  you  deal
discreetly with your madmen, so deal with  God's madmen too,
the rest of the world.  You tell not your madmen what you do
nor why you do it.  You tell  them not  what  you think.  So
you  shall  keep  knowledge in its place, where it may rest,
where it may gather its kind around it and breed.  You and I
shall keep as yet  what we know here, and here."  He touched
me on the heart and  on the  forehead, and then touched himself the same way.  "I have for  myself thoughts at the present.  Later I shall unfold to you."
<P>
     "Why not now?"  I asked.  "It may do some good.  We may
arrive at some decision."He looked at me and said,"My friend
John, when the corn is grown,  even before  it has  ripened,
while the milk of its mother earth is  in him,  and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands,
and blow away the green chaff, and say  to you, 'Look!  He's
good corn, he will make a good crop when the time comes.' "
<P>
     I did  not  see the application and  told  him so.  For
reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled
it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said,
"The good husbandman tell you so then because he  knows, but
not till then.  But you do not find the  good husbandman dig
up his planted corn  to see if he  grow.  That  is  for  the
children who play at husbandry, and  not for  those who take
it as of the work of their life.  See you now, friend  John?
I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making
it sprout, if he sprout at all, there's some promise, and  I
wait till the ear begins to swell."  He  broke off,  for  he
evidently saw  that  I understood.  Then he went on gravely,
"You were always a careful  student, and your  case book was
ever more full  than  the rest.  And I trust that good habit
have not  fail.  Remember,  my  friend,  that  knowledge  is
stronger than memory,  and  we should  not trust the weaker.
Even if you have not kept the good practice, let me tell you
that this case of our dear miss is one that may be, mind,  I
say may be, of such interest to us and others  that all  the
rest may not make him kick  the  beam,  as  your people say.
Take then good note of it.  Nothing is too small.  I counsel
you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises. Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess.
We learn from failure, not from success!"
<P>
     When  I  described Lucy's symptoms, the same as before,
but infinitely more  marked, he looked very grave, but said
nothing.  He took with him a bag in which were many instruments  and  drugs,  "the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade," as  he  once called, in one of his lectures,
the equipment of a professor of the healing craft.
<P>
     When we were shown in,  Mrs. Westenra met us.  She was
alarmed, but not nearly so much as I  expected to find her.
Nature in one of her  beneficient  moods  has ordained that
even death has some antidote to its  own terrors.  Here, in
a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal,
even the terrible change in her daughter  to whom she is so
attached, do not seem  to reach her.  It is  something like
the way  dame  Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil
that which it would  otherwise harm by contact.  If this be
an ordered selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper
root for its causes than we have knowledge of.
<P>
     I  used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and set  down  a  rule that she should not be present
with Lucy, or think of her illness more than was absolutely
required. She assented readily, so readily that I saw again
the hand of Nature fighting for life.  Van Helsing and I were
shown up to Lucy's room.  If  I was  shocked when I saw her
yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her today.
<P>
     She was ghastly, chalkily pale. The red seemed to have
gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face
stood out prominently.  Her breathing was painful to see or
hear.  Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his  eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose.  Lucy
lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak,
so for a while we were all silent. Then Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out  of the room.  The instant
we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage
to the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly
in with him and closed the door.  "My god!" he said.  "This
is dreadful.  There  is not time to be  lost.  She will die
for  sheer want  of blood  to keep the heart's action as it
should be. There must be a transfusion of blood at once. Is
it you or me?"
<P>
     "I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me."
<P>
     "Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag.  I am
prepared."
<P>
     I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there
was a knock at the hall door. When we reached the hall, the
maid  had  just  opened the  door, and  Arthur was stepping
quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper,
<P>
     "Jack, I was so  anxious.  I read between the lines of
your letter, and have been in an agony. The dad was better,
so I ran down here to see for myself. Is not that gentleman
Dr.  Van Helsing?  I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming."
<P>
     When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him, he had
been angry  at his interruption at such a time, but now, as
he  took  in  his  stalwart  proportions and recognized the
strong young manhood  which seemed to emanate from him, his
eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to him as he held out
his hand,
<P>
     "Sir, you have come in time.  You are the lover of our
dear miss.  She is bad,  very, very bad.  Nay, my child, do
not go like that."For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in
a chair almost fainting.  "You are to help her.  You can do
more than any that live, and your courage is your best help."
<P>
     "What can I do?" asked Arthur hoarsely.  "Tell me, and
I shall  do it.  My life is hers' and I would give the last
drop of blood in my body for her."
<P>
     The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could
from old knowledge detect a  trace  of  its  origin  in his
answer.
<P>
     "My  young  sir, I do not ask so much as that, not the
last!"
<P>
     "What shall I do?" There was fire in his eyes, and his
open nostrils quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him
on the shoulder.
<P>
     "Come!"   he said.  "You are a man, and it is a man we
want.  You are better than me, better than my friend John."
Arthur looked bewildered,  and the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way.
<P>
     "Young miss  is  bad,  very bad.  She wants blood, and
blood she must have or die.  My friend John and I have consulted, and we are about to perform what we call transfusion
of  blood, to transfer  from full veins of one to the empty
veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he
is the more young and strong than me."--Here Arthur took my
hand and wrung it hard in silence.--"But  now you are here,
you are more good than us, old or young, who  toil much  in
the world of thought.  Our nerves are  not so calm and  our
blood so bright than yours!"
<P>
     Arthur turned to him  and  said, "If you only knew how
gladly I would die for her you would understand . . ."   He
stopped with a sort of choke in his voice.
<P>
     "Good boy!" said Van Helsing.   "In the not-so-far-off
you will  be happy that you have done all for her you love.
Come now and be  silent.  You shall kiss her once before it
is  done,  but then  you must go,  and you must leave at my
sign.  Say no word to Madame.  You know how it is with her.
There must be no shock, any knowledge of this would be one.
Come!"
<P>
     We all went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction remained outside.  Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but
said nothing.  She was not asleep,  but she  was simply too
weak to make the effort.  Her eyes spoke to us, that was all.
<P>
     Van  Helsing  took  some things  from his bag and laid
them on a little table out  of sight.  Then he mixed a narcotic,  and  coming  over to the bed, said cheerily,  "Now,
little miss, here is your medicine.  Drink it  off,  like a
good child.  See, I  lift you  so  that to swallow is easy.
Yes."  She had made the effort with success.
<P>
     It astonished me how long the drug took to act.  This,
in fact, marked the extent of her weakness. The time seemed
endless until  sleep  began  to flicker in her eyelids.  At
last, however, the  narcotic began to manifest its potency,
and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was satisfied, he called Arthur into  the room, and bade him strip
off his coat.  Then he added, "You may take that one little
kiss whiles  I bring  over the table.  Friend John, help to
me!"  So neither of us looked whilst he bent over her.
<P>
     Van Helsing,  turning to me, said, "He is so young and
strong,  and  of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate
it."
<P>
     Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed  the operation.  As the transfusion went on,
something  like  life  seemed to  come back  to poor Lucy's
cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy  of his
face seemed absolutely to shine.  After  a bit  I began  to
grow anxious, for the loss of blood  was telling on Arthur,
strong man as he was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible
strain Lucy's system must have undergone that what weakened
Arthur only partially restored her.
<P>
     But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in
hand, and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on
Arthur.  I could hear my own heart beat. Presently, he said
in a soft voice, "Do not stir an instant. It is enough. You
attend him.  I will look to her."
<P>
     When all was over, I could see how much Arthur was weakened.  I  dressed  the  wound and took his arm to bring him
away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round, the man
seems to have eyes in the back of his head,"The brave lover,
I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have presently."  And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted
the pillow to the patient's  head.  As he did so the narrow
black  velvet band which she seems always to wear round her
throat, buckled  with an old diamond buckle which her lover
had given  her, was  dragged a little up,  and showed a red
mark on her throat.
<P>
     Arthur  did  not  notice it, but I could hear the deep
hiss  of  indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's ways
of betraying  emotion.  He  said nothing at the moment, but
turned to me, saying, "Now take down our brave young lover,
give him of the port wine, and let him lie down a while. He
must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that he
may be  recruited  of what he has so given to his love.  He
must not stay here. Hold a moment! I may take it, sir, that
you are anxious of result.  Then bring it with you, that in
all  ways  the operation is successful.  You have saved her
life this time, and  you can go  home and rest easy in mind
that all that can  be is.  I shall tell her all when she is
well.  She  shall love  you none the less for what you have
done.   Goodbye."
<P>
     When  Arthur  had  gone I went back to the room.  Lucy
was  sleeping  gently, but  her  breathing was stronger.  I
could  see  the  counterpane move as her breast heaved.  By
the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her  intently.  The
velvet band again covered the red mark.  I asked  the  Professor in a whisper, "What  do you make of that mark on her
throat?"
<P>
     "What do you make of it?"
<P>
     "I have not examined it yet," I answered, and then and
there proceeded to  loose the band.  Just over the external
jugular  vein  there were two punctures, not large, but not
wholesome looking.  There was  no sign  of disease, but the
edges were white and worn looking, as if by some trituration.
It at once occurred to me that that this wound, or whatever
it was,  might be the means of that manifest loss of blood.
But I abandoned the idea as  soon as  it formed, for such a
thing could not be.  The whole bed would have been drenched
to a scarlet with the blood  which the girl must  have lost
to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.
<P>
     "Well?"  said Van Helsing.
<P>
     "Well," said I.  "I can make nothing of it."
<P>
     The Professor stood up.  "I  must go back to Amsterdam
tonight," he said  "There  are books and things there which
I want.  You  must remain here all  night, and you must not
let your sight pass from her."
<P>
     "Shall I have a nurse?"  I asked.
<P>
     "We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all
night.  See that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs
her.  You must not sleep all the night.Later on we can sleep,
you and I.  I shall  be back as soon as possible.  And then
we may begin."
<P>
     "May begin?"  I said.  "What on earth do you mean?"
<P>
     "We shall see!" he answered, as he hurried out.  He came
back a moment  later  and  put his head inside the door and
said with a warning finger held up,  "Remember, she is your
charge.  If you  leave  her, and harm befall, you shall not
sleep easy hereafter!"
<P>

<P>
     DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--CONTINUED
<P>

<P>
     8 September.--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate
worked itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally.  She
looked a different being from what she had been  before the
operation.  Her spirits even were good, and she was full of a
happy  vivacity,  but I could see evidences of the absolute
prostration which she had undergone.  When I told Mrs.  Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up
with her, she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her
daughter's  renewed strength  and excellent spirits.  I was
firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil.  When
her maid had prepared her for the night I came in, having in
the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside.
<P>
     She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me
gratefully whenever I caught her eye.  After a long spell she
seemed  sinking  off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to
pull herself together and shook it off.  It was apparent that
she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once.
<P>
     "You do not want to sleep?"
<P>
     "No.  I am afraid."
<P>
     "Afraid to go to sleep!  Why so? It is the boon we all
crave for."
<P>
     "Ah, not if you were like me, if sleep was to you a presage of horror!"
<P>
     "A presage of horror!  What on earth do you mean?"
<P>
     "I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  And that is what is
so terrible.  All this weakness comes to me in sleep, until
I dread the very thought."
<P>
     "But,  my dear girl, you may sleep tonight.  I am here
watching you, and I can promise  that nothing will happen."
<P>
     "Ah, I can trust you!" she said.
<P>
     I seized the opportunity, and said, "I promise that if
I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once."
<P>
     "You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me.
Then I will sleep!"  And almost at the word she gave a deep
sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep.
<P>
     All night long I watched by her.  She never stirred, but
slept on and on in a deep, tranquil,  life-giving,  healthgiving sleep. Her lips were slightly parted, and her breast
rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum.  There was
a smile on her  face, and it was evident that no bad dreams
had come to disturb her peace of mind.
<P>
     In the early morning her maid came, and  I left her in
her care and took myself back home, for I was anxious about
many things.  I sent  a  short wire  to  Van Helsing and to
Arthur, telling  them of the excellent result of the operation.  My own  work, with its manifold arrears, took me all
day  to clear  off.  It was dark when I was able to inquire
about my  zoophagous patient.  The report was good.  He had
been quite quiet for the  past day and  night.  A  telegram
came from Van Helsing  at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner,
suggesting that I should  be at  Hillingham  tonight, as it
might be well to be at hand, and stating that he  was leaving by the night mail and would join  me early in the morning.
<P>

<P>
     9 September.--I  was  pretty tired and worn out when I
got to Hillingham.  For  two nights I had hardly had a wink
of sleep, and my brain was  beginning to feel that numbness
which marks cerebral exhaustion.  Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said,
<P>
     "No sitting  up tonight for you.  You are worn out.  I
am quite well again.  Indeed, I am, and if there is to be any
sitting up, it is I who will sit up with you."
<P>
     I would not argue the point, but went and had my supper.
Lucy came with me, and, enlivened  by her charming presence,
I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the
more than excellent port.  Then  Lucy took me upstairs, and
showed me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning.
<P>
     "Now," she said.  "You  must stay here.  I shall leave
this door open and my door too. You can lie on the sofa for
I know  that  nothing would induce any of you doctors to go
to bed whilst there is a patient above the  horizon.  If  I
want  anything  I shall call out, and you can come to me at
once."
<P>
     I  could  not but  acquiesce, for I was dog tired, and
could not have sat up had I tried.  So, on her renewing her
promise to call me if she should want anything, I lay on the
sofa, and forgot all about everything.
<P>

LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY
<P>

<P>
     9 September.--I feel so happy tonight.  I have been so
miserably  weak, that to be able to think and move about is
like  feeling  sunshine after a long spell of east wind out
of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me.
I seem to feel his presence warm about me.  I suppose it is
that sickness  and weakness are selfish things and turn our
inner  eyes  and sympathy  on  ourselves, whilst health and
strength  give love rein, and in thought and feeling he can
wander where  he  wills.  I know where my thoughts are.  If
only Arthur knew!  My dear,  my dear, your ears must tingle
as you sleep, as mine do waking.  Oh,  the blissful rest of
last night!  How  I slept,  with that dear, good Dr. Seward
watching me.  And tonight I shall not fear  to sleep, since
he is close at hand and  within  call.  Thank everybody for
being so good to me.  Thank God!  Goodnight Arthur.
<P>

  DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
<P>

<P>
     10 September.--I was conscious of the Professor's hand
on my head, and started awake all in a second.  That is one
of the things that we learn in an asylum, at any rate.
<P>
     "And how is our patient?"
<P>
     "Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me," I
answered.
<P>
     "Come, let us see," he said. And together we went into
the room.
<P>
     The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently,
whilst  Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread,
over to the bed.
<P>
     As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I heard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration,
and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart.
As  I  passed  over  he  moved back, and his exclamation of
horror,  "Gott in Himmel!"  needed  no enforcement from his
agonized  face.  He raised his hand and pointed to the bed,
and his iron face was drawn and ashen white.  I felt my knees
begin to tremble.
<P>
     There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy,
more horribly white and  wan-looking  than  ever.  Even the
lips were white, and the gums  seemed to have shrunken back
from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness.
<P>
     Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the
instinct of  his life and all the long years of habit stood
to him, and he put it down again softly.
<P>
     "Quick!" he said.  "Bring the brandy."
<P>
     I  flew to  the dining room, and returned with the decanter. He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together
we rubbed palm and wrist and heart.  He felt her heart, and
after a few moments of agonizing suspense said,
<P>
     "It is not too late.  It beats, though but feebly. All
our work is undone.  We must begin again. There is no young
Arthur here now.  I have to call on you yourself this time,
friend John." As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag, and
producing the instruments of transfusion.  I had taken off my
coat and rolled up my shirt sleeve.  There was no possibility
of an opiate just at present, and  no need of one.  and so,
without a moment's delay, we began the operation.
<P>
     After a time, it did not seem a short time either, for
the draining  away of one's  blood, no matter how willingly
it be given, is  a terrible  feeling, Van Helsing held up a
warning finger.  "Do not stir,"  he said.  "But I fear that
with  growing strength  she  may wake,  and that would make
danger, oh, so much danger.  But I shall precaution take. I
shall give hypodermic injection of morphia."   He proceeded
then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent.
<P>
     The  effect on  Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed
to merge subtly  into  the  narcotic  sleep.  It was with a
feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of
color steal back into  the pallid cheeks and lips.  No  man
knows, till he experiences it, what it is  to feel his  own
lifeblood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.
<P>
     The  Professor watched me critically.  "That will do,"
he said.  "Already?"  I  remonstrated.   "You took  a great
deal more from Art." To which he smiled a sad sort of smile
as he replied,
<P>
     "He is her lover, her fiance. You have work, much work
to do for her and for others, and the present will suffice.
<P>
     When we  stopped the  operation, he  attended to Lucy,
whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision.  I laid
down, while I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt
faint and a little sick.  By and by he bound up my wound, and
sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself.  As I
was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered.
<P>
     "Mind, nothing must be said of this.  If our young lover
should turn up unexpected, as  before, no word to  him.  It
would at once  frighten  him and enjealous him, too.  There
must be none.  So!"
<P>
     When I came back  he looked  at me carefully, and then
said,  "You are  not much the worse.  Go into the room, and
lie on your sofa, and rest awhile, then have much breakfast
and come here to me."
<P>
     I  followed  out his orders, for  I knew how right and
wise they  were.  I had  done my part, and now my next duty
was to  keep up my strength.  I felt very  weak, and in the
weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred.  I fell asleep  on the sofa,  however,  wondering over
and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement,
and how she  could have been drained of so  much blood with
no sign any where to show for it.  I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,  sleeping and waking my
thoughts always came  back  to the little  punctures in her
throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges,
tiny though they were.
<P>
     Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was
fairly well and strong, though not nearly so much so as the
day before.  When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for
a walk, leaving me in charge, with  strict injunctions that
I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his voice
in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.
<P>
     Lucy  chatted  with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious  that  anything  had happened.  I  tried to keep her
amused and interested.  When her mother came up to see her,
she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but said to
me gratefully,
<P>
     "We owe you so much, Dr.  Seward, for all you have done,
but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself.
You are looking pale yourself.  You  want  a  wife to nurse
and look after you a bit, that you do!"  As she spoke, Lucy
turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for her poor
wasted veins could  not stand for long an unwonted drain to
the  head.  The  reaction  came  in excessive pallor as she
turned imploring eyes on me.  I smiled and nodded, and laid
my finger on my lips.  With a sigh,  she sank back amid her
pillows.
    Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said  to  me.  "Now you go home,  and eat much and drink
enough.  Make yourself strong.  I stay  here tonight, and I
shall sit up with little miss myself.  You and I must watch
the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave
reasons.  No, do not ask the.  Think what you will.  Do not
fear to think even the most not-improbable.  Goodnight."
<P>
     In the hall two of the maids came  to me, and asked if
they or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy.  They
implored me to let  them, and when  I said  it was  Dr. Van
Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit up, they asked
me quite piteously to intercede with the`foreign gentleman'.
I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because
I am weak at present, and perhaps  because it was on Lucy's
account, that their devotion  was manifested.  For over and
over  again  have I seen similar instances of woman's kindness.  I  got back  here in time for a late dinner, went my
rounds, all well, and set this down whilst waiting for sleep.
It is coming.

     11 September.--This  afternoon I went over to Hillingham.  Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much
better.  Shortly  after I  had  arrived,  a big parcel from
abroad came for the Professor.  He  opened it with much impressment, assumed, of course, and showed  a great bundle of
white flowers.
<P>
     "These are for you, Miss Lucy," he said.
<P>
     "For me?  Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!"
<P>
     "Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are
medicines."  Here Lucy made a wry face.  "Nay, but they are
not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so you need
not snub that so charming nose, or I shall point  out to my
friend Arthur what woes he may have to  endure in seeing so
much beauty that he so loves so much distort.  Aha, my pretty
miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again.  This
is medicinal, but you do not know how.  I  put him  in your
window, I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck,
so you sleep well.  Oh, yes!  They, like the lotus  flower,
make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters of
Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores
sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late."
<P>
     Whilst he  was  speaking,  Lucy had been examining the
flowers and smelling them.  Now she threw them down saying,
with half laughter, and half disgust,
<P>
     "Oh, Professor, I  believe you are only  putting  up a
joke on me.  Why, these flowers are only common garlic."
<P>
     To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said  with all
his sternness,  his iron jaw  set and  his  bushy  eyebrows
meeting,
<P>
     "No  trifling  with me!  I  never jest!  There is grim
purpose in what I do, and I warn you that you do not thwart
me. Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own."
Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went
on more  gently, "Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me.
I only  do for  your  good, but there is much virtue to you
in those so common flowers.  See,  I  place  them myself in
your room.  I make myself the wreath that you are to  wear.
But hush!   No telling  to others  that make so inquisitive
questions.  We must  obey,  and  silence is a part of obedience, and obedience is to bring you  strong and  well into
loving arms that wait for you.  Now sit still a while. Come
with me, friend John, and you shall help  me deck  the room
with my garlic, which is all the war from Haarlem, where my
friend Vanderpool raise  herb in his glass houses  all  the
year.  I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have
been here."
<P>
     We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The
Professor's actions were certainly odd and  not to be found
in any pharmacopeia that I ever heard of.  First he fastened up the windows and latched them  securely.  Next, taking
a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes,
as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might  get
in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp
he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above,  below, and
at each side, and round the fireplace in the  same way.  It
all seemed grotesque to me, and presently  I  said,  "Well,
Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do,
but this certainly puzzles me.  It is well we have no sceptic here, or he would say that you were  working some spell
to keep out an evil spirit."
<P>
     "Perhaps  I  am!"  He answered  quietly as he began to
make the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck.
<P>
     We  then  waited  whilst  Lucy made her toilet for the
night, and  when  she was  in bed he came and himself fixed
the wreath of garlic round her neck. The last words he said
to her were,
<P>
     "Take care you do not disturb it, and even if the room
feel close, do not tonight open the window or the door."
<P>
     "I promise," said Lucy. "And thank you both a thousand
times for all your kindness to me!  Oh, what have I done to
be blessed with such friends?"
<P>
     As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van
Helsing said,"Tonight I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want,
two nights of travel, much reading in the  day between, and
much anxiety on the day to follow, and  a  night to sit up,
without to wink. Tomorrow in the morning early you call for
me,  and  we come together  to see our pretty miss, so much
more strong for my `spell' which I have work.  Ho, ho!"
<P>
     He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt
awe and vague terror.  It must  have  been my weakness that
made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it all
the more, like unshed tears.
