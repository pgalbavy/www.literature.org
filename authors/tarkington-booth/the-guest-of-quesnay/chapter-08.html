<p>Like most painters, I have supposed the tools of my craft harder
to manipulate than those of others. The use of words, particularly,
seemed readier, handier for the contrivance of effects than pigments.
I thought the language of words less elusive than that of colour,
leaving smaller margin for unintended effects; and, believing
in complacent good faith that words conveyed exact meanings exactly,
it was my innocent conception that almost anything might be so
described in words that all who read must inevitably perceive
that thing precisely. If this were true, there would be little
work for the lawyers, who produce such tortured pages in the struggle
to be definite, who swing riches from one family to another, save
men from violent death or send them to it, and earn fortunes for
themselves through the dangerous inadequacies of words. I have
learned how great was my mistake, and now I am wishing I could
shift paper for canvas, that I might paint the young man who came
to interest me so deeply. I wish I might present him here in colour
instead of trusting to this unstable business of words, so wily
and undependable, with their shimmering values, that you cannot
turn your back upon them for two minutes but they will be shouting
a hundred things which they were not meant to tell.</p>

<p>To make the best of necessity: what I have written of him&mdash;my
first impressions&mdash;must be taken as the picture, although it be
but a gossamer sketch in the air, instead of definite work with
well-ground pigments to show forth a portrait, to make you see
flesh and blood. It must take the place of something contrived
with my own tools to reveal what the following days revealed him
to me, and what it was about him (evasive of description) which
made me so soon, as Keredec wished, his friend.</p>

<p>Life among our kin and kind is made pleasanter by our daily platitudes.
Who is more tedious than the man incessantly struggling to avoid
the banal? Nature rules that such a one will produce nothing better
than epigram and paradox, saying old, old things in a new way,
or merely shifting object for subject&mdash;and his wife's face, when
he shines for a circle, is worth a glance. With no further apology,
I declare that I am a person who has felt few positive likes or
dislikes for people in this life, and I did deeply like my fellow-lodgers
at Les Trois Pigeons. Liking for both men increased with acquaintance,
and for the younger I came to feel, in addition, a kind of championship,
doubtless in some measure due to what Keredec had told me of him,
but more to that half-humourous sense of protectiveness that we
always have for those young people whose untempered and innocent
outlook makes us feel, as we say, "a thousand years old."</p>

<p>The afternoon following our first dinner together, the two, in
returning from their walk, came into the pavilion with cheerful
greetings, instead of going to their rooms as usual, and Keredec,
declaring that the open air had "dispersed" his rheumatism, asked
if he might overhaul some of my little canvases and boards. I
explained that they consisted mainly of "notes" for future use,
but consented willingly; whereupon he arranged a number of them
as for exhibition and delivered himself impromptu of the most
vehemently instructive lecture on art I had ever heard. Beginning
with the family, the tribe, and the totem-pole, he was able to
demonstrate a theory that art was not only useful to society but
its primary necessity; a curious thought, probably more attributable
to the fact that he was a Frenchman than to that of his being
a scientist.</p>

<p>"And here," he said in the course of his demonstration, pointing
to a sketch which I had made one morning just after sunrise&mdash;"here
you can see real sunshine. One certain day there came those few
certain moment' at the sunrise when the light was like this. Those
few moment', where are they? They have disappeared, gone for eternally.
They went"&mdash;he snapped his fingers&mdash;"like that. Yet here they
are&mdash;ha!&mdash;forever!"</p>

<p>"But it doesn't look like sunshine," said Oliver Saffren hesitatingly,
stating a disconcerting but incontrovertible truth; "it only seems
to look like it because&mdash;isn't it because it's so much brighter
than the rest of the picture? I doubt if paint <em>CAN </em>look
like sunshine." He turned from the sketch, caught Keredec's gathering
frown, and his face flushed painfully. "Ah!" he cried, "I shouldn't
have said it?"</p>

<p>I interposed to reassure him, exclaiming that it were a godsend
indeed, did all our critics merely speak the plain truth as they
see it for themselves. The professor would not have it so, and
cut me off.</p>

<p>"No, no, no, my dear sir!" he shouted. "You speak with kindness,
but you put some wrong ideas in his head!"</p>

<p>Saffren's look of trouble deepened. "I don't understand," he
murmured. "I thought you said always to speak the truth just as
I see it." "I have telled you," Keredec declared vehemently, "nothing
of the kind!"</p>

<p>"But only yesterday&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"I understood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you understood only one-half! I say, 'Speak the truth as
you see it, when you speak.' I did not tell you to speak! How
much time have you give' to study sunshine and paint? What do
you know about them?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered the other humbly.</p>

<p>A profound rumbling was heard, and the frown disappeared from
Professor Keredec's brow like the vanishing of the shadow of a
little cloud from the dome of some great benevolent and scientific
institute. He dropped a weighty hand on his young friend's shoulder,
and, in high good-humour, thundered:</p>

<p>"Then you are a critic! Knowing nothing of sunshine except that
it warms you, and never having touched paint, you are going to
tell about them to a man who spends his life studying them! You
look up in the night and the truth you see is that the moon and
stars are crossing the ocean. You will tell that to the astronomer?
Ha! The truth is what the masters see. When you know what they
see, you may speak."</p>

<p>At dinner the night before, it had struck me that Saffren was
a rather silent young man by habit, and now I thought I began
to understand the reason. I hinted as much, saying, "That would
make a quiet world of it."</p>

<p>"All the better, my dear sir!" The professor turned beamingly
upon me and continued, dropping into a Whistlerian mannerism that
he had sometimes: "You must not blame that great wind of a Keredec
for preaching at other people to listen. It gives the poor man
more room for himself to talk!"</p>

<p>I found his talk worth hearing.</p>

<p>I would show you, if I could, our pleasant evenings of lingering,
after coffee, behind the tremulous screen of honeysuckle, with
the night very dark and quiet beyond the warm nimbus of our candle-light,
the faces of my two companions clear-obscure in a mellow shadow
like the middle tones of a Rembrandt, and the professor, good
man, talking wonderfully of everything under the stars and over
them,&mdash;while Oliver Saffren and I sat under the spell of the big,
kind voice, the young man listening with the same eagerness which
marked him when he spoke. It was an eagerness to understand, not
to interrupt.</p>

<p>These were our evenings. In the afternoons the two went for their
walk as usual, though now they did not plunge out of sight of
the main road with the noticeable haste which Amedee had described.
As time pressed, I perceived the caution of Keredec visibly slackening.
Whatever he had feared, the obscurity and continued quiet of <em>LES
TROIS PIGEONS </em>reassured him; he felt more and more secure
in this sheltered retreat, "far out of the world," and obviously
thought no danger imminent. So the days went by, uneventful for
my new friends,&mdash;days of warm idleness for me. Let them go unnarrated;
we pass to the event.</p>

<p>My ankle had taken its wonted time to recover. I was on my feet
again and into the woods&mdash;not traversing, on the way, a certain
poppy-sprinkled field whence a fine Norman stallion snorted ridicule
over a wall. But the fortune of Keredec was to sink as I rose.
His summer rheumatism returned, came to grips with him, laid him
low. We hobbled together for a day or so, then I threw away my
stick and he exchanged his for an improvised crutch. By the time
I was fit to run, he was able to do little better than to creep&mdash;might
well have taken to his bed. But as he insisted that his pupil
should not forego the daily long walks and the health of the forest,
it came to pass that Saffren often made me the objective of his
rambles. At dinner he usually asked in what portion of the forest
I should be painting late the next afternoon, and I got in the
habit of expecting him to join me toward sunset. We located each
other through a code of yodeling that we arranged; his part of
these vocal gymnastics being very pleasant to hear, for he had
a flexible, rich voice. I shudder to recall how largely my own
performances partook of the grotesque. But in the forest where
were no musical persons (I supposed) to take hurt from whatever
noise I made, I would let go with all the lungs I had; he followed
the horrid sounds to their origin, and we would return to the
inn together.</p>

<p>On these homeward walks I found him a good companion, and that
is something not to be under-valued by a selfish man who lives
for himself and his own little ways and his own little thoughts,
and for very little else,&mdash;which is the kind of man (as I have
already confessed) that I was&mdash;deserving the pity of all happily
or unhappily married persons.</p>

<p>Responsive in kind to either a talkative mood or a silent one,
always gentle in manner, and always unobtrusively melancholy,
Saffren never took the initiative, though now and then he asked
a question about some rather simple matter which might be puzzling
him. Whatever the answer, he usually received it in silence, apparently
turning the thing over and over and inside out in his mind. He
was almost tremulously sensitive, yet not vain, for he was neither
afraid nor ashamed to expose his ignorance, his amazing lack of
experience. He had a greater trouble, one that I had not fathomed.
Sometimes there came over his face a look of importunate wistfulness
and distressed perplexity, and he seemed on the point of breaking
out with something that he wished to tell me&mdash;or to ask me, for
it might have been a question&mdash;but he always kept it back. Keredec's
training seldom lost its hold upon him.</p>

<p>I had gone back to my glade again, and to the thin sunshine,
which came a little earlier, now that we were deep in July; and
one afternoon I sat in the mouth of the path, just where I had
played the bounding harlequin for the benefit of the lovely visitor
at Quesnay. It was warm in the woods and quiet, warm with the
heat of July, still with a July stillness. The leaves had no motion;
if there were birds or insects within hearing they must have been
asleep; the quivering flight of a butterfly in that languid air
seemed, by contrast, quite a commotion; a humming-bird would have
made a riot.</p>

<p>I heard the light snapping of a twig and a swish of branches
from the direction in which I faced; evidently some one was approaching
the glade, though concealed from me for the moment by the winding
of the path. Taking it for Saffren, as a matter of course (for
we had arranged to meet at that time and place), I raised my voice
in what I intended for a merry yodel of greeting.</p>

<p>I yodeled loud, I yodeled long. Knowing my own deficiencies in
this art, I had adopted the cunning sinner's policy toward sin
and made a joke of it: thus, since my best performance was not
unsuggestive of calamity in the poultry yard, I made it worse.
And then and there, when my mouth was at its widest in the production
of these shocking ulla-hootings, the person approaching came round
a turn in the path, and within full sight of me. To my ultimate,
utmost horror, it was Madame d'Armand.</p>

<p>I grew so furiously red that it burned me. I had not the courage
to run, though I could have prayed that she might take me for
what I seemed&mdash;plainly a lunatic, whooping the lonely peace of
the woods into pandemonium&mdash;and turn back. But she kept straight
on, must inevitably reach the glade and cross it, and I calculated
wretchedly that at the rate she was walking, unhurried but not
lagging, it would be about thirty seconds before she passed me.
Then suddenly, while I waited in sizzling shame, a clear voice
rang out from a distance in an answering yodel to mine, and I
thanked heaven for its mercies; at least she would see that my
antics had some reason.</p>

<p>She stopped short, in a half-step, as if a little startled, one
arm raised to push away a thin green branch that crossed the path
at shoulder-height; and her attitude was so charming as she paused,
detained to listen by this other voice with its musical youthfulness,
that for a second I thought crossly of all the young men in the
world.</p>

<p>There was a final call, clear and loud as a bugle, and she turned
to the direction whence it came, so that her back was toward me.
Then Oliver Saffren came running lightly round the turn of the
path, near her and facing her.</p>

<p>He stopped as short as she had.</p>

<p>Her hand dropped from the slender branch, and pressed against
her side.</p>

<p>He lifted his hat and spoke to her, and I thought she made some
quick reply in a low voice, though I could not be sure.</p>

<p>She held that startled attitude a moment longer, then turned
and crossed the glade so hurriedly that it was almost as if she
ran away from him. I had moved aside with my easel and camp-stool,
but she passed close to me as she entered the path again on my
side of the glade. She did not seem to see me, her dark eyes stared
widely straight ahead, her lips were parted, and she looked white
and frightened.</p>

<p>She disappeared very quickly in the windings of the path.</p>
