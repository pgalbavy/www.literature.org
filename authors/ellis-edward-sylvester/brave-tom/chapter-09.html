<p>Tom Gordon was not only brave, but he was modest; and he hurried
away from the swarming crowd as soon as he was free of the ferry-boat,
for he found it anything but pleasant to be looked upon and treated
as a lion. Turning off into one of the intersecting streets, the
two lads walked along in silence, when Tom said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know, Jim, I'm half-frozen?"</p>

<p>The rattling teeth emphasized the question.</p>

<p>"I should think you would be. Here's a place of some kind; let's
go in and have something to eat, and you can warm yourself."</p>

<p>Jim led the way; and as he pushed open the green-baize doors,
which worked on springs, he saw they had entered one of those
nondescript shops, so numerous in certain parts of New York, where
a person can obtain any kind of alcoholic drink, a cigar, a lunch,
a "square meal," or a night's lodging, or all.</p>

<p>Jim recognized the resort, and he would have withdrawn but through
sympathy for his shivering companion. The latter could scarcely
stand from cold, his clothing was soaked, and, in the keen air,
had congealed so that it rattled like tarpauling as he walked.</p>

<p>Just back from the door was a large stove, whose bulging, white-washed
cylinder, gleamed red with heat.</p>

<p>Tom immediately stepped up to this and began to thaw himself
out.</p>

<p>"Ah, that feels nice!" he laughed to his companion.</p>

<p>"Well, young man, what do you want in here?" asked the bartender,
in a sharp, business-like style, bustling from behind the counter
with the evident intention of "bouncing" the lads.</p>

<p>"I want to get dry and warm," was the reply of Tom, from whose
clothing the steam was beginning to ascend.</p>

<p>"This ain't a shop to dry out boys. Why don't you go home?"</p>

<p>"We haven't any home."</p>

<p>"That's played; go where you stayed last night."</p>

<p>"That's near a hundred miles from here."</p>

<p>Two or three loungers laughed at the rather pert style in which
Tom made his replies, though in truth the lad meant no disrespect.
The bartender turned red in the face, and was angered at being
taken up as he was.</p>

<p>"Hello, my wharf-rat, how did you get so wet?"</p>

<p>"In the water."</p>

<p>"He jumped off the ferry-boat to save a little girl," said Jim,
seeing the storm brewing, and desirous of putting in a good word
for his friend.</p>

<p>This declaration was received with a guffaw, not one of the hearers
believing a word of it.</p>

<p>"Jumped off to get away from the Bobbies," sneered the bartender.
"If you don't get out of here quicker'n lightning I'll hand you
over to them."</p>

<p>"We can go out if you say so," said Tom, in the same good-natured
manner; "but we came in to get our supper and stay all night."</p>

<p>"Have you got the stamps to pay for it?"</p>

<p>"If we hadn't we'd know better than to come in here."</p>

<p>"All right; my terms are a half a dollar apiece for supper and
lodging."</p>

<p>"What is it with breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Seventy-five cents."</p>

<p>"We might as well pay you now."</p>

<p>And in his off-hand fashion Tom drew from his water-soaked pocket
his portemonnaie, remarking to Jim that they would arrange it
between themselves, and handed the exact change to the somewhat
surprised bartender and clerk.</p>

<p>That made a difference; and the servant became as obsequious
as if he had just recognized in his visitor a millionaire that
had dropped in to spend a part of his fortune with him.</p>

<p>The boys were hungry, as may be supposed, and they fell to eating
like a couple of famished wanderers. Only a mouthful or two was
swallowed when Jim exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hello, Tom; where did you get that gold chain?"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" demanded Tom, looking up at his
friend.</p>

<p>"I'll show you;" and, as Jim spoke, he reached over and unhooked
a tiny gold chain from the upper button of his friend's coat,
around which it was twined in a singular manner.</p>

<p>More than that, there was a locket attached to it.</p>

<p>"That's the strangest thing I ever heard tell of," said Tom,
as he examined the chain and locket. "I never knew it was there
till you spoke."</p>

<p>"You must have got it from that girl in the water, when you helped
her out."</p>

<p>"That's so! Wait here till I come back!" and with this exclamation
the lad sprang up and darted outdoors.</p>

<p>He was gone but a short time, when he returned.</p>

<p>"I've been down to the ferry-house to see whether I could find
the woman and give her back her jewelry; but nobody there knows
anything about her, and I'll have to keep it till I learn who
she is."</p>

<p>On looking at the locket the boys agreed that it was the likeness
of the girl that had so narrowly escaped drowning. They admired
it a long time, after which Tom carefully put it away, and they
finished their supper.</p>

<p>The supper finished, the boys sat in the hot room until Tom's
clothing was fully dried, during which process the two were urged
to drink fully a score of times, Tom being assured by several
that the only way to escape a dangerous cold was to swallow a
good supply of gin.</p>

<p>Like sensible lads they steadfastly refused, as they had never
tasted spirituous liquors, and never intended to.</p>

<p>Finally, at a late hour, they retired to their humble room, where
they were speedily asleep.</p>

<p>On the morrow it was agreed that they would make this place their
headquarters, while they looked up something to do. They could
separate and spend the day in the search, and return to their
lodging-house after dark, both having fixed the location in their
minds, and there being little excuse for losing their way, even
in such a vast city.</p>

<p>Breakfast was eaten early, and the friends separated, not expecting
to see each other till dusk again. Both were in high spirits,
for in the clear sunshine of the winter's morning the world looked
bright and radiant to them. The hurry and rush of Broadway, the
crowds constantly surging forward, each one seemingly intent on
his own business, the constant roll and rumble of trade,&mdash;all
so different from the more sedate city they had left behind.</p>

<p>All these were so new and novel to the lads, threading their
way through the great metropolis, that they forgot their real
business for a time, and feasted their eyes and ears for hours.</p>

<p>Finally, they roused themselves and went to work. The experience
of the two, for a time at least, was very similar. Tom first stopped
in a dry-goods house, and asked whether they could give him anything
to do. A short "No" was the reply, and the proprietor instantly
turned his back upon him. Then he tried a drug-store, where he
was treated in the same manner. In a hat and cap store, the rotund
clerk tried to chaff him, but he didn't make much of a success
of it. In answer to his question, the clerk replied that he didn't
need a boy just then, but when he did he would send his carriage
around to the Metropolitan for him.</p>

<p>When Tom timidly introduced his errand to an old gentleman in
spectacles, as he sat at his desk in a large shipping-office,
the old fellow exclaimed in an awed voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Great Heavens, no! I don't want to hire any boy."</p>

<p>And so it went, hour after hour, until the future, which had
looked so beautiful in the morning, gradually became overcast
with clouds, and the poor lad was forced to stop and rest from
sheer weariness.</p>

<p>He kept it up bravely till night, when he started on his return
to his lodgings. He found on inquiry that he was several miles
distant, his wanderings having covered more ground than he supposed.
He had made over thirty applications, and in no instance had he
received one grain of encouragement. In more than one case he
had been insulted and ordered from the store, followed by the
intimation that he was some runaway or thief.</p>

<p>No wonder that Tom felt discouraged and depressed in spirits
as he rode homeward in the street-car. He was so wearied that
he dropped down in one corner, where he soon fell asleep, not
waking until he had gone fully two miles beyond the point where
he should have left the vehicle. This sleep so mixed him up that
it was nearly ten o'clock when he reached his hotel, as we may
call it.</p>

<p>He was hopeful that Jim would have a better story to tell; but
to his amazement, he found that his friend, despite the lateness
of the hour, had not yet come back. A shiver of alarm passed over
Tom, for he was certain that some dreadful evil had befallen him.</p>

<p>Most likely he had been waylaid and killed in some of the hundred
different ways which the police reports show are adopted by the
assassins of New York in disposing of their victims.</p>
