<p>The story of Turner's death at unknown hands spread in the next few
days like wild fire.
</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the lack of sympathy for the young man's
undertakings of reform, it was now only remembered that he was a Stacy
who had been "dogged to his death" by Towers' minions, and ugly
rumblings of threat awoke along the water courses where his kinsmen
dwelt.
</p><p>It was voiced abroad that Jerry Henderson could not outlive that week:
that when he died, the body of Bear Cat Stacy would be buried with him,
and that, from those two graves, the Stacys would turn away to wreak a
sanguinary vengeance.
</p><p>Yet all this was the sheerest sort of rumor. No man had proof that a
Towers rifle had killed Turner--the man to whom his clan had looked for
leadership. No man had seen the body which his family was said to be
holding for that dramatic consignment to the earth.
</p><p>But in part the report found fulfilment. On Sunday afternoon Blossom
leaned over the quilt-covered figure of her dying husband to realize
that he was no longer dying but dead.
</p><p>"Speak ter me, Jerry," she cried as she dug her nails into her palms.
"Speak ter me--jest one time more."
</p><p>She sought to call out to her father, but her lips refused the service,
and as she came to her feet she stretched out her hands and crumpled,
insensible, to the floor.
</p><p>Brother Fulkerson went that afternoon to the saw-mill at the back of
Uncle Israel's store and stood by as the storekeeper himself sawed
planks and knocked together the crude box which must serve Jerry
Henderson as a casket. Later across the counter he bought some yards of
coarse cloth cut from a bolt of black calico, which was to be his
daughter's pathetic attempt at mourning dress.
</p><p>The afternoon of the funeral was unspeakably sullen and dismal. Clouds
of leaden dreariness hung to the bristling mountains, themselves as
gray as slate. Cold skies promised snow and through the bleak nakedness
of the forest whined the dirge-like complaint of a gusty wind.
</p><p>To the unkempt place of briar-choked and sunken graves, crawled a dingy
procession.
</p><p>Blossom would have preferred going with her dead unattended save by her
father, but that mountain usage forebade. A wedding or a funeral could
not be so monopolized in a land where there is frugally little to break
daily monotony. This funeral above all others, belonged in part to the
public, made pregnant with interest by the story that two bodies
instead of one would be laid to rest. The question of how Bear Cat
Stacy had come to his death would be answered over his open grave, and
men would know at the falling of the last clod whether they should
return quietly to their homes or prepare for the sterner task of
reprisal.
</p><p>Kinnard Towers must know, too, what happened there, and must know it
speedily, though to go himself or to send one of his recognized
lieutenants was beyond the question. Yet his plans were carefully laid.
Those few nondescripts who bore the repute of being Stacy sympathizers,
while in fact they were Towers informers, were to be present; and along
the miles of "slavish roughs" between Quarterhouse and burial-ground,
like runners in a relay race, were other heralds. When the news began
to come from the place it would travel fast. Sitting grimly behind the
closed stockade of the Quarterhouse and surrounded now not only by a
body-guard but by some scores of fighting men, the old intriguer
anxiously awaited the outcome.
</p><p>Long before the hour for the services had arrived men, as drab and
neutral in color as the sodden skies, and women wrapped in shawls of
red and blue, began to gather from hither and yon over roads mired to
the prohibition even of "jolt-wagons." They came on foot or on muddied
mules and horses with briar-tangled manes and tails--and having
arrived, they waited, shuffling their weary feet against frost-bite and
eddying in restless currents.
</p><p>Two men were still at work with shovels and they had spread out their
excavation so wide, in removing slabs of unbreakable rock, that the
place might have been a single, double or even a triple grave.
</p><p>The wind moaned as murky clouds began to spit snow, and then on the
gulch-washed road which climbed steeply, a little procession was
glimpsed in the distance.
</p><p>The men fondled their guns, but the cortège was lost again to view
behind a screen of cedars and until it turned finally on the level of
the graveyard itself, its details remained invested with the suspense
of expectancy.
</p><p>At the fore, when it arrived, was Brother Fulkerson astride his old
mare, and on a pillion behind him rode the "Widder Henderson," the
whiteness of her thin face startlingly accentuated by the unrelieved
lines of her black calico gown. Under her erstwhile vivid eyes lay dark
rings of suffering, but she held her head rigid and gazed straight
before her.
</p><p>The cortège came without the proper hush of due solemnity, for the
rough coffin that held Jerry Henderson's body was borne on a fodder
sledge and the stolid team of oxen that drew it required constant and
vociferous shouts and goading as they strained unwillingly against
their yokes. After the sledge trailed a dozen neighbors, afoot and
mounted; all plastered with mud--but the crowd caught its breath and
broke into a low murmur. There was only one casket!
</p><p>As the evangelist dismounted and lifted his daughter down, the men who
were there as observers for Kinnard Towers sought places near enough to
hear every syllable.
</p><p>Yet when the elderly preacher began to speak, while his daughter stood
with the dull apathy of one only half realizing, the faces of the crowd
mirrored a sort of sullen disappointment. For them the burial of the
man who was, after all, well-nigh a stranger, was secondary in
interest. It was in every material respect touching their lives and
deeper interests, Bear Cat's funeral they had come to attend. But on
that topic the bearded shepherd meant to give them no satisfaction. So
far he had made no mention of Bear Cat, and now he was concluding with
the injunction: "Let us pray."
</p><p>But as he bent his head, a woman standing near the foot of the grave
raised a hand that trembled with all the violence of superstitious
fear. From her thin lips broke a half-smothered shriek, not loud but
eerie and disconcerting, and she shrilled in terrorized notes, "Air
thet a specter I sees thar?"
</p><p>Many eyes followed the pointed finger and again a dismayed chorus of
inarticulate sound broke from the crowd. Just behind Blossom--herself
ghostlike in her white rigidness--had materialized a figure that had
not been there before. It was a gaunt figure whose face these people
had seen before only bronzed and aggressive. Now the cheek-bones stood
out in exaggerated prominence and the flesh was bloodlessly gray.
Though Bear Cat Stacy was present in the flesh his sudden
materialization there might well have startled a superstitious mind
into the thought that he had come not only from a bed of illness but
from one of death. Ignoring the sensation he had created, he spoke in a
whisper to the minister, and Brother Fulkerson made a quiet
announcement.
</p><p>"Hit hain't no ghost, sister. Turner Stacy hes been sore sick an' nigh
ter death, but hit's pleased ther Almighty ter spare him. Let us pray."
</p><p>A man near the grave began quietly working his way to the outer fringes
of the gathering, and when he had escaped immediate observation, he
went with hot haste. Kinnard must know of this.
</p><p>He had detected an undernote in that general murmur of astonishment,
which was clearly one of satisfaction. The Stacys had derived pleasure
in this ocular proof that Bear Cat was not dead.
</p><p>As the preacher said "Amen" Bear Cat bent tensely forward and caught
both of Blossom's hands in his own. "I kain't tarry," he said, "even
fer a leetle spell, but I wanted ye ter know thet I done my best ter
get hyar afore."
</p><p>She looked at him with dazed eyes which under the intensity of his gaze
slowly began to awaken into understanding.
</p><p>Turner went on eagerly, "I started over hyar as soon as I got yore
letter, but I was set upon an' wounded. I've been insensible well nigh
ever sence then."
</p><p>"Oh, Turney!" she whispered, as the grief which had held her in its
thrall of unrelieved apathy suddenly broke into an overflow of tears.
"Oh, Turney, I'm glad ye <u>tried</u>. He kept callin' fer ye. 'Peared like
he wanted to tell ye somethin'." The clods were falling dully on the
grave.
</p><p>The crowd held back, fretting against the edict of decorum, as the
voices rose in the miserable treble of song, to which two hounds added
their anguished howls. At the last words of the verse, an instant
clamor of question and discussion broke in eager storm--but Bear Cat
had melted into the thicket at his back. With the same mystifying
suddenness that had characterized his appearance, he had now
disappeared.
</p><p>Excited men rushed hither and thither, calling his name. They beat the
woods and tramped the roads, but with as little result as though he
had, in fact, appeared out of his grave and returned again to its
hiding.
</p><p>The story of that funeral was going with the pervasive swiftness of
wind throughout the country-side. It was being mouthed over in dark
cabins where toothless grannies and white-shocked grandsires wagged
their heads and recalled the manner of Bear Cat's birth.
</p><hr/>
<p>When Joe Sanders had left Bear Cat that afternoon at the abandoned
cabin, it had been with the impression that Stacy meant to take the
path which he had advised; the only path that was not certainly closed
to his escape, and seek refuge at Dog Tate's house. He had found an
immediate opportunity to report that program to Dog himself, and Dog
sought to make use of it in Bear Cat's service.
</p><p>Tate, in recognition of his grievance as an outraged distiller, had
been given the leadership of one of the largest of the search parties,
which it was his secret purpose to lead far afield on a blind trail.
Inasmuch as Bear Cat had been specifically cautioned against going in
the direction of his own dwelling place, and yet since that would seem
a logical goal, Dog had maneuvered his hunters into territory between
the abandoned cabin and Little Slippery.
</p><p>He himself had been in the woods across the waters of the suddenly
swollen creek, when an outburst of rifle fire told him that something
had gone wrong and brought him running back to the guidance of that
musketry.
</p><p>He arrived at the edge of the swirling, drift-encumbered water in time
to see the silhouetted figure on the opposite bluff totter and plunge
head first into the moonlit whirlpool. Dog knew that he was the only
man on that side of the stream, but any effort to plunge in and try for
a rescue would mean death to himself without hope of saving the man who
had fallen. As he watched he made out what seemed to be the lifeless
body come to the surface, to be swept in a rushing circle and, as
chance would have it, to catch and hang lodged in a mass of floating
dead-wood. The creek at ordinary times ran shallow and though it was
gushing now beyond its normal borders it was still not wide. The
deadwood swirled, raced forward, and fouled the out-jutting root of a
giant sycamore.
</p><p>Dog Tate crawled out along the precarious support of the slimy rootage
and slowly drew the mass of drift into shallow water. It was tedious
work since any violent tugging might loosen the lightly held tangle and
send the body floating away unbuoyed.
</p><p>The night was all a thing of blue and silver moonlight and sooty
shadows, but under the muddy bulwark at the base of the overhanging
sycamore the velvet denseness of impenetrable black prevailed.
</p><p>Once Dog saw figures outlined on the bluff from which Bear Cat had
fallen, and had to lie still for the seeming of hours, trusting to the
favor of the shadow.
</p><p>Eventually he succeeded in drawing the mass of flotsam shoreward until
he could wade in to the shallows, chancing the quicksands that were
tricky there. Then he stumbled up the bank with his burden and
deposited it between two bowlders where without daylight it would
hardly be found. Dog was thinking fast, now.
</p><p>He did not yet know whether he had saved a living man or retrieved a
dead body, but his eagerness for investigation on that score must wait.
Now he must rejoin the chase and turn it away from such dangerous
nearness to its quarry.
</p><p>So Tate ran down the bank and shouted. Voices replied and figures
became visible on the farther shore.
</p><p>"I seed him fall in," came the mendacious assurance of the man who was
playing two parts. "I waded in atter him--but he went floatin' on down
stream."
</p><p>"Did he look like he mout be alive?" was the anxious query and the
reply came as promptly. "He had every seemin' of bein' stone dead."
</p><p>For a while they searched the banks, until, having discovered the hat,
they decided to go back and let the final hunt for the body wait until
morning.
</p><p>But Dog had gone home and roused Joe Sanders, who had come in about
midnight from another group of searchers, and the two of them had
slipped back and recovered the limp burden--to find it still alive.
Between midnight and dawn they carried Bear Cat to the house of Bud
Jason. The wound this time had glanced the skull, bringing
unconsciousness but no fracture. The shock and the hours of lying wet
in the freezing air had resulted in something like pneumonia, and for
days Bear Cat had lain there in fever and delirium.
</p><p>But the old miller had held grimly on despite the danger of discovery,
and his woman had nursed with her rude knowledge of herbs, until the
splendid reserve of strength, that had already been so prodigally
taxed, proved itself still adequate. He had raved, they told him later,
of shaking hands with someone whom he hated.
</p><p>"Hev ye raided any more stills?" demanded Bear Cat when at last he had
been able to talk, and Dog, who had been in every day, grinned:
</p><p>"We 'lowed thet could wait a spell," he assured the crusader. "We had
our hands right full es hit war."
</p><p>But the morning following Jerry Henderson's funeral, two more coils of
copper were discovered aloft, and one of the men who had composed
Kinnard's relay of messengers was liberated at daybreak after spending
several tedious and unsatisfactory hours lashed to a dog-wood sapling.
</p><hr/>
<p>If Kinnard Towers had raged before, now he fumed. Heretofore, it had
been a condition of open war or one of acknowledged, even if
precarious, peace. This was a mongrel situation which was neither the
one nor the other, and every course was a dangerous one. The Stacys
held their counsel, neither sanctioning the incorrigible black sheep of
their flock in open declaration, nor yet totally relinquishing their
right to avenge him, if an outside hand fell upon him. Meanwhile, the
fiction of this young trouble-maker's charmed life was arousing the
superstitious to its acceptance as a sort of powerful fetish.
</p><p>The very name Bear Cat was beginning to fall from the lips of
tow-headed children, with open-mouthed awe, like a term of witchcraft,
and this candid terror of children was, of course, only a reflection of
the unconfessed, yet profound impression, stamped upon the minds of
their elders.
</p><p>"What ails everybody hyarabouts?" rumbled Kinnard over his evening
pipe. "Heretofore when a man needed killin' he's been kilt--an' thet's
all thar was ter hit. This young hellion walks inter sure death traps
an' walks out ergin. He falls over a clift inter a ragin' torrent--an'
slips through an army of men. In Satan's name, what air hit?"
</p><p>Black Tom's rejoinder was not cheering: "Ef ye asks me, I think all
these stories of witchcraft, backed up by his luck, hes cast a spell on
folks. They thinks Bear Cat's in league with grave-yard spooks."
</p><p>Kinnard knocked the ashes out of his pipe. His lips curled
contemptuously. "An' es fer yoreself--does you take stock in thet damn'
foolery, too?"
</p><p>"I hain't talkin' erbout myself," retorted Tom sullenly. "Ye asked
erbout what folks was cogitatin' an' I'm a-tellin' ye. If ye don't
believe thar's a notion thet graves opens an' ther dead fights with
him, jest go out an' talk ter these benighted hill-billies yoreself. If
evidence air what ye wants, ye'll git a lavish of hit."
</p><p>Those who were in Bear Cat's confidence constituted a close
corporation, and they were not all, like Dog and Joe, men who mixed
also with the enemy, gaining information while they railed against
their own leader. There was talk of secret and mysterious meetings held
at midnight by oath-bound men--to whom flowed a tide of recruits.
</p><p>Kinnard believed these meetings to be a part of the general myth. His
crude but effective secret service could gather no tangible evidence in
support of their storied sessions.
</p><p>One evening report drifted in to the Quarterhouse that some one had
seen Bear Cat Stacy at a point not far distant, and that he had been
boldly walking the open road--unaccompanied. Within the hour a party
was out, supplied with jugs and bottles enough to keep the vengeful
fires well fueled throughout the night. It was an evil-looking squad,
and its appearance was in no wise deceptive. Its members, all save one,
had begun their evening at the Quarterhouse bar. The one exception was
George Kelly, a young man recently married, who had gone there to talk
other business with Towers. George had an instinctive tendency toward
straightforwardness, but he had also an infirmity of character which
caused him to follow where a more aggressive nature led--and he had
fallen under Kinnard's domination. His small tract of tillable land was
mortgaged, and Kinnard held over him the lash of financial supremacy.
He could fight, but he could not argue, and when the unofficial posse
was sent out that night, being in the place, he lacked the courage to
refuse participation.
</p><p>They had found the footprints of the fugitive and had met two men who
claimed to have seen him in the flesh, but Bear Cat himself had eluded
them and near midnight they halted to rest. They threw themselves down
in a small rock-walled basin which was broken at one point by a narrow
gorge, through which they had come. It was a good place to revel in
after labor because it was so shut-in that the bonfire they kindled
could not be far seen. The jugs were opened and passed around. It had
set in to rain, and though they could endure that bodily discomfort
while they had white liquor, their provident souls took thought against
the rusting of their firearms. The guns were accordingly placed under a
ledge of rock a few feet distant, all save one. Kelly lacking the
buoyant courage of drunkenness, preferred to keep his weapon close at
hand. He listened moodily and unresponsively to the obscene stories and
ribald songs, which elicited thick peals of laughter from his
companions. They had hunted hard, and now they were wassailing hard.
The long march home would sober them so they need not restrain their
appetites.
</p><p>Some impulse led Kelly to raise his eyes from the sordid picture in the
red waver of the fire and glance toward the doorlike opening of the
gorge. The eyes remained fixed--and somehow the rifle on his knees did
not come up, as it should have done. A figure stood there silently,
contemptuously looking on, and it was as gaunt and gray as that of a
foraging wolf. It was as lean and sinewy, too, and out of the face
glowed a pair of eyes dangerously narrow and glittering.
</p><p>Then with a scornful laugh the figure stepped forward, bending lithely
from the waist, with two steel-steady hands gripping two automatic
pistols at its front.
</p><p>"War you boys a-sarchin' fer me?" demanded Bear Cat and the trailing
voices, that had been drunkenly essaying close harmony, broke off
mid-verse. "Stay right whar ye're at, every mother's son of ye!" came
the sharp injunction. "The man thet stirs air a dead man. This hain't
no play-party thet I've done come ter."
</p><p>They sat suddenly silent, abruptly surly and helpless; all save one.
George Kelly was still armed, and sitting somewhat apart. Beseechingly
his companions sought by covert glance to signal him that he should
avail himself of his armed advantage while they continued to distract
the newcomer's attention.
</p><p>Bear Cat's pistols broke out and two treasured jugs were shattered.
</p><p>"Jim Towers," came the raspingly dictatorial order, "when ye goes back
ter ther Quarterhouse ye kin tell Kinnard Towers thet Bear Cat Stacy
hain't ter be captured by no litter of drunkards. Tell him he mout es
well hire sober murderers or else quit."
</p><p>As Towers sat glowering and silent, Stacy's voice continued in its
stinging contempt.
</p><p>"You damned murder hirelings, does ye think thet I'm ter be tuck
prisoner by sneakin' weasels like you?"
</p><p>George Kelly had sat silent. Now he rose to his feet, and Stacy ordered
curtly, "Lay down thet gun, George. Ye're ther only man I'm astonished
ter see hyar. I 'lowed ye war better then a hired assassin."
</p><p>From someone came thick-tongued exhortation, "Git him, Kelly, you've
got a gun. Git ther damn' parson."
</p><p>In the momentary centering of Bear Cat's attention upon George, some
one slipped with a cat-like furtiveness of motion back into the thicker
darkness--toward the cached rifles.
</p><p>Then a strange thing happened.
</p><p>George Kelly wheeled, ignoring the order to drop his weapon, but
instead of pointing it at the lone invader he leveled it across the
fire-lit circle.
</p><p>"Stop thet!" he yelled. "Leave them rifle-guns be or I aims ter shoot."
</p><p>Surprise was following on surprise, and the half-befuddled faces of the
drinkers went blank with perplexity and incredulity.
</p><p>"What ther hell does ye mean? What did ye come out with us fer?"
demanded a shrill voice, and Kelly's response spat back at him
viciously. "I means thet what Bear Cat says are true es text. I mean
thet 'stid of seekin' ter kill him, I'm a-goin' along with him. I've
done been a slave ter Kinnard Towers long enough--an' right now I aims
ter quit."
</p><p>"Shell we tell Kinnard thet?" demanded Jim Towers dryly.
</p><p>"Tell him any damn' thing ye likes. I'm through with him," and turning
toward the astonished Stacy, he added, "I reckon we've done all we
needs ter do hyar. We've busted thar bottles--an' thet's ter say we've
busted thar hearts. Let's leave."
</p><p>But Bear Cat's face was still grim and his words came with a
clear-clipped sharpness. "Not yit.... They've still got some guns over
thar.... I'll hold 'em where they're huddled, steady es a bird-dog. You
git them guns."
</p><p>George Kelly went circumspectly around the circumference of the fire
and started back again, bearing an armful of rifles. At one point he
had to pass so close to the dejectedly hulking shoulders of a seated
figure that his knee brushed the coat--and at that instant the man
swept out his hand and jerked violently at the passing ankle.
</p><p>Kelly did not go down, but he lunged stumblingly, and scattered weapons
broke from his grasp. Even then he had the quickness of thought to
throw them outward toward Bear Cat's feet and leaped side-wise himself,
still clinging to one that had not fallen.
</p><p>Taking advantage of the excitement Jim Towers sought to recover his
feet--and almost succeeded. But with a readier agility Bear Cat leaped
and his right hand, still gripping the pistol, swept outward in an arc.
Under a blow that dropped him unconscious and bleeding from a face laid
open as if by a shod hoof, Towers collapsed, scattering red embers as
he fell.
</p><p>Two others were on their feet now, but, facing Stacy's twin pistols and
the rifle in the hands of their deserter, they gauged the chances and
without a word stretched their hands high above their heads.
</p><p>"Now well tek up a collection--of guns--once more," directed Stacy,
"an' leave hyar."
</p><p>As two men backed through the gorge into darkness, out of which only
one had come, a murder party, disarmed and mortified, shambled to its
respective feet and busied itself with a figure that lay insensible
with its head among the scattered embers.
</p><p>"George," said Turner a half hour later, "ye come ter me when I needed
ye right bad--but hit's mighty unfortunate thet ye hed ter do hit jest
thet way. Ye're ther only man I've got whose name is beknownst ter
Kinnard Towers--an' next ter me, thar won't be a man in ther hills
harder dogged. Ye hain't been married long--an' ye dastn't go home
now."
</p><p>George Kelly shook his head. "I'm in hit now up ter my neck--an' thar
hain't no goin' back. Afore they hes ther chanst ter stop me though,
I'm goin' by home ter see my woman, an' bid her fare over ter her folks
in Virginny."
