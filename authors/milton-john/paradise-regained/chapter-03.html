<BLOCKQUOTE>
SO spake the Son of God; and Satan stood<BR>
A while as mute, confounded what to say,<BR>
What to reply, confuted and convinced<BR>
Of his weak arguing and fallacious drift;<BR>
At length, collecting all his serpent wiles,<BR>
With soothing words renewed, him thus accosts:--<BR>
<BR>
  "I see thou know'st what is of use to know,<BR>
What best to say canst say, to do canst do;<BR>
Thy actions to thy words accord; thy words<BR>
To thy large heart give utterance due; thy heart<BR>
Contains of good, wise, just, the perfet shape.<BR>
Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult,<BR>
Thy counsel would be as the oracle<BR>
Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems<BR>
On Aaron's breast, or tongue of Seers old<BR>
Infallible; or, wert thou sought to deeds<BR>
That might require the array of war, thy skill<BR>
Of conduct would be such that all the world<BR>
Could not sustain thy prowess, or subsist<BR>
In battle, though against thy few in arms.<BR>
These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide?<BR>
Affecting private life, or more obscure<BR>
In savage wilderness, wherefore deprive<BR>
All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thyself<BR>
The fame and glory--glory, the reward<BR>
That sole excites to high attempts the flame<BR>
Of most erected spirits, most tempered pure<BR>
AEthereal, who all pleasures else despise,<BR>
All treasures and all gain esteem as dross,<BR>
And dignities and powers, all but the highest?<BR>
Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe.  The son<BR>
Of Macedonian Philip had ere these<BR>
Won Asia, and the throne of Cyrus held<BR>
At his dispose; young Scipio had brought down<BR>
The Carthaginian pride; young Pompey quelled<BR>
The Pontic king, and in triumph had rode.<BR>
Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature,<BR>
Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment.<BR>
Great Julius, whom now all the world admires,<BR>
The more he grew in years, the more inflamed<BR>
With glory, wept that he had lived so long<BR>
Ingloroious.  But thou yet art not too late."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom our Saviour calmly thus replied:--<BR>
"Thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth<BR>
For empire's sake, nor empire to affect<BR>
For glory's sake, by all thy argument.<BR>
For what is glory but the blaze of fame,<BR>
The people's praise, if always praise unmixed?<BR>
And what the people but a herd confused,<BR>
A miscellaneous rabble, who extol<BR>
Things vulgar, and, well weighed, scarce worth the praise?<BR>
They praise and they admire they know not what,<BR>
And know not whom, but as one leads the other;<BR>
And what delight to be by such extolled,<BR>
To live upon their tongues, and be their talk?<BR>
Of whom to be dispraised were no small praise--<BR>
His lot who dares be singularly good.<BR>
The intelligent among them and the wise<BR>
Are few, and glory scarce of few is raised.<BR>
This is true glory and renown--when God,<BR>
Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks<BR>
The just man, and divulges him through Heaven<BR>
To all his Angels, who with true applause<BR>
Recount his praises.  Thus he did to Job,<BR>
When, to extend his fame through Heaven and Earth,<BR>
As thou to thy reproach may'st well remember,<BR>
He asked thee, 'Hast thou seen my servant Job?'<BR>
Famous he was in Heaven; on Earth less known,<BR>
Where glory is false glory, attributed<BR>
To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame.<BR>
They err who count it glorious to subdue<BR>
By conquest far and wide, to overrun<BR>
Large countries, and in field great battles win,<BR>
Great cities by assault.  What do these worthies<BR>
But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave<BR>
Peaceable nations, neighbouring or remote,<BR>
Made captive, yet deserving freedom more<BR>
Than those their conquerors, who leave behind<BR>
Nothing but ruin wheresoe'er they rove,<BR>
And all the flourishing works of peace destroy;<BR>
Then swell with pride, and must be titled Gods,<BR>
Great benefactors of mankind, Deliverers,<BR>
Worshipped with temple, priest, and sacrifice?<BR>
One is the son of Jove, of Mars the other;<BR>
Till conqueror Death discover them scarce men,<BR>
Rowling in brutish vices, and deformed,<BR>
Violent or shameful death their due reward.<BR>
But, if there be in glory aught of good;<BR>
It may be means far different be attained,<BR>
Without ambition, war, or violence--<BR>
By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent,<BR>
By patience, temperance.  I mention still<BR>
Him whom thy wrongs, with saintly patience borne,<BR>
Made famous in a land and times obscure;<BR>
Who names not now with honour patient Job?<BR>
Poor Socrates, (who next more memorable?)<BR>
By what he taught and suffered for so doing,<BR>
For truth's sake suffering death unjust, lives now<BR>
Equal in fame to proudest conquerors.<BR>
Yet, if for fame and glory aught be done,<BR>
Aught suffered--if young African for fame<BR>
His wasted country freed from Punic rage--<BR>
The deed becomes unpraised, the man at least,<BR>
And loses, though but verbal, his reward.<BR>
Shall I seek glory, then, as vain men seek,<BR>
Oft not deserved?  I seek not mine, but His<BR>
Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Tempter, murmuring, thus replied:--<BR>
"Think not so slight of glory, therein least<BR>
Resembling thy great Father.  He seeks glory,<BR>
And for his glory all things made, all things<BR>
Orders and governs; nor content in Heaven,<BR>
By all his Angels glorified, requires<BR>
Glory from men, from all men, good or bad,<BR>
Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption.<BR>
Above all sacrifice, or hallowed gift,<BR>
Glory he requires, and glory he receives,<BR>
Promiscuous from all nations, Jew, or Greek,<BR>
Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declared;<BR>
From us, his foes pronounced, glory he exacts."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom our Saviour fervently replied:<BR>
"And reason; since his Word all things produced,<BR>
Though chiefly not for glory as prime end,<BR>
But to shew forth his goodness, and impart<BR>
His good communicable to every soul<BR>
Freely; of whom what could He less expect<BR>
Than glory and benediction--that is, thanks--<BR>
The slightest, easiest, readiest recompense<BR>
From them who could return him nothing else,<BR>
And, not returning that, would likeliest render<BR>
Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy?<BR>
Hard recompense, unsuitable return<BR>
For so much good, so much beneficience!<BR>
But why should man seek glory, who of his own<BR>
Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs<BR>
But condemnation, ignominy, and shame--<BR>
Who, for so many benefits received,<BR>
Turned recreant to God, ingrate and false,<BR>
And so of all true good himself despoiled;<BR>
Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take<BR>
That which to God alone of right belongs?<BR>
Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace,<BR>
That who advances his glory, not their own,<BR>
Them he himself to glory will advance."<BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Son of God; and here again<BR>
Satan had not to answer, but stood struck<BR>
With guilt of his own sin--for he himself,<BR>
Insatiable of glory, had lost all;<BR>
Yet of another plea bethought him soon:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Of glory, as thou wilt," said he, "so deem;<BR>
Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass.<BR>
But to a Kingdom thou art born--ordained<BR>
To sit upon thy father David's throne,<BR>
By mother's side thy father, though thy right<BR>
Be now in powerful hands, that will not part<BR>
Easily from possession won with arms.<BR>
Judaea now and all the Promised Land,<BR>
Reduced a province under Roman yoke,<BR>
Obeys Tiberius, nor is always ruled<BR>
With temperate sway: oft have they violated<BR>
The Temple, oft the Law, with foul affronts,<BR>
Abominations rather, as did once<BR>
Antiochus.  And think'st thou to regain<BR>
Thy right by sitting still, or thus retiring?<BR>
So did not Machabeus.  He indeed<BR>
Retired unto the Desert, but with arms;<BR>
And o'er a mighty king so oft prevailed<BR>
That by strong hand his family obtained,<BR>
Though priests, the crown, and David's throne usurped,<BR>
With Modin and her suburbs once content.<BR>
If kingdom move thee not, let move thee zeal<BR>
And duty--zeal and duty are not slow,<BR>
But on Occasion's forelock watchful wait:<BR>
They themselves rather are occasion best--<BR>
Zeal of thy Father's house, duty to free<BR>
Thy country from her heathen servitude.<BR>
So shalt thou best fulfil, best verify,<BR>
The Prophets old, who sung thy endless reign--<BR>
The happier reign the sooner it begins.<BR>
Rein then; what canst thou better do the while?"<BR>
<BR>
  To whom our Saviour answer thus returned:--<BR>
"All things are best fulfilled in their due time;<BR>
And time there is for all things, Truth hath said.<BR>
If of my reign Prophetic Writ hath told<BR>
That it shall never end, so, when begin<BR>
The Father in his purpose hath decreed--<BR>
He in whose hand all times and seasons rowl.<BR>
What if he hath decreed that I shall first<BR>
Be tried in humble state, and things adverse,<BR>
By tribulations, injuries, insults,<BR>
Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence,<BR>
Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting<BR>
Without distrust or doubt, that He may know<BR>
What I can suffer, how obey?  Who best<BR>
Can suffer best can do, best reign who first<BR>
Well hath obeyed--just trial ere I merit<BR>
My exaltation without change or end.<BR>
But what concerns it thee when I begin<BR>
My everlasting Kingdom?  Why art thou<BR>
Solicitous?  What moves thy inquisition?<BR>
Know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall,<BR>
And my promotion will be thy destruction?"<BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Tempter, inly racked, replied:--<BR>
"Let that come when it comes.  All hope is lost<BR>
Of my reception into grace; what worse?<BR>
For where no hope is left is left no fear.<BR>
If there be worse, the expectation more<BR>
Of worse torments me than the feeling can.<BR>
I would be at the worst; worst is my port,<BR>
My harbour, and my ultimate repose,<BR>
The end I would attain, my final good.<BR>
My error was my error, and my crime<BR>
My crime; whatever, for itself condemned,<BR>
And will alike be punished, whether thou<BR>
Reign or reign not--though to that gentle brow<BR>
Willingly I could fly, and hope thy reign,<BR>
From that placid aspect and meek regard,<BR>
Rather than aggravate my evil state,<BR>
Would stand between me and thy Father's ire<BR>
(Whose ire I dread more than the fire of Hell)<BR>
A shelter and a kind of shading cool<BR>
Interposition, as a summer's cloud.<BR>
If I, then, to the worst that can be haste,<BR>
Why move thy feet so slow to what is best?<BR>
Happiest, both to thyself and all the world,<BR>
That thou, who worthiest art, shouldst be their King!<BR>
Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detained<BR>
Of the enterprise so hazardous and high!<BR>
No wonder; for, though in thee be united<BR>
What of perfection can in Man be found,<BR>
Or human nature can receive, consider<BR>
Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent<BR>
At home, scarce viewed the Galilean towns,<BR>
And once a year Jerusalem, few days'<BR>
Short sojourn; and what thence couldst thou observe?<BR>
The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory,<BR>
Empires, and monarchs, and their radiant courts--<BR>
Best school of best experience, quickest in sight<BR>
In all things that to greatest actions lead.<BR>
The wisest, unexperienced, will be ever<BR>
Timorous, and loth, with novice modesty<BR>
(As he who, seeking asses, found a kingdom)<BR>
Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous.<BR>
But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit<BR>
Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes<BR>
The monarchies of the Earth, their pomp and state--<BR>
Sufficient introduction to inform<BR>
Thee, of thyself so apt, in regal arts,<BR>
And regal mysteries; that thou may'st know<BR>
How best their opposition to withstand."<BR>
<BR>
  With that (such power was given him then), he took<BR>
The Son of God up to a mountain high.<BR>
It was a mountain at whose verdant feet<BR>
A spacious plain outstretched in circuit wide<BR>
Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flowed,<BR>
The one winding, the other straight, and left between<BR>
Fair champaign, with less rivers interveined,<BR>
Then meeting joined their tribute to the sea.<BR>
Fertil of corn the glebe, of oil, and wine;<BR>
With herds the pasture thronged, with flocks the hills;<BR>
Huge cities and high-towered, that well might seem<BR>
The seats of mightiest monarchs; and so large<BR>
The prospect was that here and there was room<BR>
For barren desert, fountainless and dry.<BR>
To this high mountain-top the Tempter brought<BR>
Our Saviour, and new train of words began:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Well have we speeded, and o'er hill and dale,<BR>
Forest, and field, and flood, temples and towers,<BR>
Cut shorter many a league.  Here thou behold'st<BR>
Assyria, and her empire's ancient bounds,<BR>
Araxes and the Caspian lake; thence on<BR>
As far as Indus east, Euphrates west,<BR>
And oft beyond; to south the Persian bay,<BR>
And, inaccessible, the Arabian drouth:<BR>
Here, Nineveh, of length within her wall<BR>
Several days' journey, built by Ninus old,<BR>
Of that first golden monarchy the seat,<BR>
And seat of Salmanassar, whose success<BR>
Israel in long captivity still mourns;<BR>
There Babylon, the wonder of all tongues,<BR>
As ancient, but rebuilt by him who twice<BR>
Judah and all thy father David's house<BR>
Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste,<BR>
Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis,<BR>
His city, there thou seest, and Bactra there;<BR>
Ecbatana her structure vast there shews,<BR>
And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates;<BR>
There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream,<BR>
The drink of none but kings; of later fame,<BR>
Built by Emathian or by Parthian hands,<BR>
The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there<BR>
Artaxata, Teredon, Ctesiphon,<BR>
Turning with easy eye, thou may'st behold.<BR>
All these the Parthian (now some ages past<BR>
By great Arsaces led, who founded first<BR>
That empire) under his dominion holds,<BR>
From the luxurious kings of Antioch won.<BR>
And just in time thou com'st to have a view<BR>
Of his great power; for now the Parthian king<BR>
In Ctesiphon hath gathered all his host<BR>
Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild<BR>
Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid<BR>
He marches now in haste.  See, though from far,<BR>
His thousands, in what martial equipage<BR>
They issue forth, steel bows and shafts their arms,<BR>
Of equal dread in flight or in pursuit--<BR>
All horsemen, in which fight they most excel;<BR>
See how in warlike muster they appear,<BR>
In rhombs, and wedges, and half-moons, and wings."<BR>
<BR>
  He looked, and saw what numbers numberless<BR>
The city gates outpoured, light-armed troops<BR>
In coats of mail and military pride.<BR>
In mail their horses clad, yet fleet and strong,<BR>
Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice<BR>
Of many provinces from bound to bound--<BR>
From Arachosia, from Candaor east,<BR>
And Margiana, to the Hyrcanian cliffs<BR>
Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales;<BR>
From Atropatia, and the neighbouring plains<BR>
Of Adiabene, Media, and the south<BR>
Of Susiana, to Balsara's haven.<BR>
He saw them in their forms of battle ranged,<BR>
How quick they wheeled, and flying behind them shot<BR>
Sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face<BR>
Of their pursuers, and overcame by flight;<BR>
The field all iron cast a gleaming brown.<BR>
Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor, on each horn,<BR>
Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight,<BR>
Chariots, or elephants indorsed with towers<BR>
Of archers; nor of labouring pioners<BR>
A multitude, with spades and axes armed,<BR>
To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill,<BR>
Or where plain was raise hill, or overlay<BR>
With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke:<BR>
Mules after these, camels and dromedaries,<BR>
And waggons fraught with utensils of war.<BR>
Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp,<BR>
When Agrican, with all his northern powers,<BR>
Besieged Albracea, as romances tell,<BR>
The city of Gallaphrone, from thence to win<BR>
The fairest of her sex, Angelica,<BR>
His daughter, sought by many prowest knights,<BR>
Both Paynim and the peers of Charlemane.<BR>
Such and so numerous was their chivalry;<BR>
At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presumed,<BR>
And to our Saviour thus his words renewed:--<BR>
<BR>
  "That thou may'st know I seek not to engage<BR>
Thy virtue, and not every way secure<BR>
On no slight grounds thy safety, hear and mark<BR>
To what end I have brought thee hither, and shew<BR>
All this fair sight.  Thy kingdom, though foretold<BR>
By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou<BR>
Endeavour, as thy father David did,<BR>
Thou never shalt obtain: prediction still<BR>
In all things, and all men, supposes means;<BR>
Without means used, what it predicts revokes.<BR>
But say thou wert possessed of David's throne<BR>
By free consent of all, none opposite,<BR>
Samaritan or Jew; how couldst thou hope<BR>
Long to enjoy it quiet and secure<BR>
Between two such enclosing enemies,<BR>
Roman and Parthian?  Therefore one of these<BR>
Thou must make sure thy own: the Parthian first,<BR>
By my advice, as nearer, and of late<BR>
Found able by invasion to annoy<BR>
Thy country, and captive lead away her kings,<BR>
Antigonus and old Hyrcanus, bound,<BR>
Maugre the Roman.  It shall be my task<BR>
To render thee the Parthian at dispose,<BR>
Choose which thou wilt, by conquest or by league.<BR>
By him thou shalt regain, without him not,<BR>
That which alone can truly reinstall thee<BR>
In David's royal seat, his true successor--<BR>
Deliverance of thy brethren, those Ten Tribes<BR>
Whose offspring in his territory yet serve<BR>
In Habor, and among the Medes dispersed:<BR>
The sons of Jacob, two of Joseph, lost<BR>
Thus long from Israel, serving, as of old<BR>
Their fathers in the land of Egypt served,<BR>
This offer sets before thee to deliver.<BR>
These if from servitude thou shalt restore<BR>
To their inheritance, then, nor till then,<BR>
Thou on the throne of David in full glory,<BR>
From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond,<BR>
Shalt reign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom our Saviour answered thus, unmoved:--<BR>
"Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm<BR>
And fragile arms, much instrument of war,<BR>
Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought,<BR>
Before mine eyes thou hast set, and in my ear<BR>
Vented much policy, and projects deep<BR>
Of enemies, of aids, battles, and leagues,<BR>
Plausible to the world, to me worth naught.<BR>
Means I must use, thou say'st; prediction else<BR>
Will unpredict, and fail me of the throne!<BR>
My time, I told thee (and that time for thee<BR>
Were better farthest off), is not yet come.<BR>
When that comes, think not thou to find me slack<BR>
On my part aught endeavouring, or to need<BR>
Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome<BR>
Luggage of war there shewn me--argument<BR>
Of human weakness rather than of strength.<BR>
My brethren, as thou call'st them, those Ten Tribes,<BR>
I must deliver, if I mean to reign<BR>
David's true heir, and his full sceptre sway<BR>
To just extent over all Israel's sons!<BR>
But whence to thee this zeal?  Where was it then<BR>
For Israel, or for David, or his throne,<BR>
When thou stood'st up his tempter to the pride<BR>
Of numbering Israel--which cost the lives<BR>
of threescore and ten thousand Israelites<BR>
By three days' pestilence?  Such was thy zeal<BR>
To Israel then, the same that now to me.<BR>
As for those captive tribes, themselves were they<BR>
Who wrought their own captivity, fell off<BR>
From God to worship calves, the deities<BR>
Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth,<BR>
And all the idolatries of heathen round,<BR>
Besides their other worse than heathenish crimes;<BR>
Nor in the land of their captivity<BR>
Humbled themselves, or penitent besought<BR>
The God of their forefathers, but so died<BR>
Impenitent, and left a race behind<BR>
Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce<BR>
From Gentiles, but by circumcision vain,<BR>
And God with idols in their worship joined.<BR>
Should I of these the liberty regard,<BR>
Who, freed, as to their ancient patrimony,<BR>
Unhumbled, unrepentant, unreformed,<BR>
Headlong would follow, and to their gods perhaps<BR>
Of Bethel and of Dan?  No; let them serve<BR>
Their enemies who serve idols with God.<BR>
Yet He at length, time to himself best known,<BR>
Remembering Abraham, by some wondrous call<BR>
May bring them back, repentant and sincere,<BR>
And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood,<BR>
While to their native land with joy they haste,<BR>
As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft,<BR>
When to the Promised Land their fathers passed.<BR>
To his due time and providence I leave them."<BR>
<BR>
  So spake Israel's true King, and to the Fiend<BR>
Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles.<BR>
So fares it when with truth falsehood contends.<BR>
