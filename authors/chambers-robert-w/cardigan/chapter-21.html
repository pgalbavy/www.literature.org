<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>My journey to Albany was slow, easy, and uneventful; I spared
Warlock because of his added burdens, though he would gladly have
galloped the entire distance, for the poor fellow was bitterly
ashamed of playing pack-horse and evinced the greatest desire
to finish and have done with it as soon as convenient.</p>

<p>His mortification was particularly to be noticed when he met
other horses: he would turn his head away when he passed a pretty
mare, he would hang his head when gay riders cantered past, and,
when he met a peddler's horse, he actually shuddered.</p>

<p>But Warlock need not have taken it so to heart: he was the peer
of any horse we met, which truly is no great recommendation, for
the people of Albany do exhibit the most sorry horseflesh I have
ever seen, and so Sir William had always said, laughing frequently
at the patroons' nags until Sir Peter Warren wrote him to be careful
else he might offend the entire town.</p>

<p>As for Albany itself I found it very large, though smaller than
New York or Boston, they said, and I marvelled to see so many
troops in various bright uniforms hitherto unfamiliar to me. The
people themselves were somewhat stupid, being full o' Dutch blood
and foodstuffs, and appeared somewhat mean in their dealings with
strangers, though they call this penny-clipping thrift. Still,
gentle blood never yet warmed at the prospect of under-feeding
a stranger to save a shilling, and I found myself out of touch
with those honest burghers of Albany who crowded the sleepy tap-room
of the "Half-Moon Tavern" where I lodged.</p>

<p>I had no great difficulty in finding Peter Weaver, or in recommending
myself to his good offices. He informed me that my uncle, Sir
Terence Cardigan, was dying o' drink in Ireland, and wished me
to go to him. I politely declined, and told him why. He was a
pleasant, kindly, over-fed man, somewhat given to long and pointless
discourse, yet a gentleman in bearing and a courteous friend.
In his care I deposited my childish treasures for safe-keeping,
taking with me only three extra articles, namely, my silver-gray
clothes with underwear befitting, Sir William's leather book,
and the knot of ribbon from Silver Heels's sleeve.</p>

<p>In Albany I bought a ring of plain gold to fit half-way on my
little finger, judging Silver Heels's finger to be of that roundness.
I also purchased a razor, though I had no present use for such
an article. Still, I could not tell how soon my cheeks might require
it, and it would not do to be caught unawares.</p>

<p>I stayed but one day in Albany, paying dearly for bait at the
"Half-Moon Tavern," but my joy in my freedom and my happiness
in expectancy left no room for rancour against these stolid, thrifty
people who, after all, were but following the instincts of their
breed.</p>

<p>Sir William was the most liberal man I had ever known, always
cautious in condemnation, though he unknowingly did poor Cresap
injustice; but I have often heard him say that to choose between
the Dutch and the French for thrift and ferocity was totally beyond
his power.</p>

<p>What I have seen of the Dutch or of those in whose veins runs
Dutch blood confirms this. Since the Spaniards perpetrated their
crimes in the New World, no people have ever been guilty of such
shocking savagery towards the Indians as have the Dutch. Placid,
honest in their own fashion, cleanly, sober, almost passionless,
they yet have, deep within them, a ferocity and malignity scarcely
conceivable&mdash;scarcely credible unless one has read that early
history of their occupation here, of which little of the truth
now remains on record.</p>

<p>The Albany people appear to have little sympathy to spare for
unfortunate Boston. However, of that I cannot speak with authority,
seeing that the whole town is soldier-ridden, and Tories everywhere
holding forth in tap-room and marketplace. Besides, a company
of Colonel John Butler's irregulars and a body of ne'er-do-well
Onondagas were camped across the river, and their behaviour to
the country people is drunken and scandalous.</p>

<p>Before I left Albany to set out on the Boston high-road, I visited
Mr. Livingston's house, knowing that such a courtesy I owed for
Sir William's sake, yet scarcely pleased at the prospect of again
meeting Mrs. Hamilton. However, I had my journey for my pains,
Mr. Livingston being lately deceased, and Mrs. Hamilton having
left the day before to visit in Boston. Thus free of further obligation,
Warlock and I took the Boston road at dawn; and how the dear fellow
did gallop, though he carried but a buckskin dragoon without company
or colours or commission to bear arms!</p>

<p>The first two days of my travel were almost without incident,
lovely, calm October days through which sunlit clouds sailed out
of the west, and the wild ducks drifted southward like floating
banners in the sky.</p>

<p>In the yellow sunlight of the fields the quails were whistling,
the heath-hens thundered through the copse, the crested partridge,
with French ruff spread, stepped dainty as a game-cock through
the briers, with his breathless menace: "Quhit! Quhit! Quhit!"</p>

<p>Once, riding on a treeless stretch of sandy road under the hot
sun, a vast company of wild pigeons began to pass high overhead,
thousands on thousands, thicker and ever thicker, till as far
as the eye could reach from east to west they covered the sky
in millions and millions, while the sun went out as in a thunder-cloud,
and the air whistled and rang with their wings.</p>

<p>Their passage lasted some twenty minutes; a fine flight, truly,
yet in Tryon County, near Fonda's Bush, Sir William and I had
marked greater flights, lasting more than an hour.</p>

<p>This and Warlock's narrow escape from being bitten by one of
those red snakes which pilot the rattlesnake and go blind in September
were the only two noteworthy incidents of the first two days'
journey on the Boston highway.</p>

<p>On the third day Warlock cast both hind shoes, and I was obliged
to lead him very carefully, mile after mile, until, towards sundown,
I entered a little village, where in a smithy a forge reddened
the fading daylight.</p>

<p>The smith, a gruff man, gave me news of Boston, that the Port
Bill was starving the poor and driving all decent people towards
open rebellion. As for himself, he said that he meant to march
at the first drum-beat and carry his hammer if firelocks were
lacking.</p>

<p>He spoke sullenly and with a peculiar defiance, doubtless suspicious
of me in spite of my buckskins. I told him that I knew little
concerning the wrongs of Boston, but that if any man disturbed
my native country, the insolence touched me as closely as though
my own door-yard had been trampled. Whereat he laughed and gave
me a brawny, blackened fist to shake. So I rode away in the dusk.</p>

<p>To make up for the delay in travelling afoot all day, I determined
to keep on until midnight, Warlock being fit and ready without
effort; so I munched a quarter of bread to stay my stomach and
trotted on, pondering over the past, which already seemed years
behind me.</p>

<p>The moon came up, but was soon frosted by silvery shoals of clouds.
Then a great black bank pushed up from the west, covering moon
and stars in sombre gloom, touched now and again by the dull flicker
of lightning. The storm was far off, for I could hear no thunder,
though the increasing stillness of the air warned me to seek the
first shelter offered.</p>

<p>The district through which I was passing was well populated,
and I expected every moment to see some light shining across the
road from possibly hospitable windows. So I kept a keen outlook
on every side, while the fields and woods through which I passed
grew ominously silent, and that delicate perfume which arises
from storm-threatened herbage filled my nostrils.</p>

<p>After a while, far away, the low muttering of thunder sounded,
setting the air vibrating, and I cast Warlock free at a hand-gallop.</p>

<p>Imperceptibly the dark silence around turned into sound; a low,
monotonous murmur filled my ears. It rained.</p>

<p>Careless of my rifle, having of course no need for it on such
a populous highway, I let the priming take care of itself and
urged Warlock forward towards two spots of light which might come
from windows very far away, or from the lamps of a post-chaise
near at hand.</p>

<p>Reining in, I was beginning to wonder which it might be, and
had finally decided on the distant cottage, when my horse reared
violently, almost falling on his back with me, and at the same
moment I knew that somebody had seized his bridle.</p>

<p>"Stand and deliver!" came a calm voice from the darkness. I already
had my rifle raised, but my thumb on the pan gave me warning that
the priming was soaking wet.</p>

<p>"Dismount," came the voice, a trifle sharply.</p>

<p>I felt for the bridle, which had been jerked from my hands; it
was gone. I gave one furious glance at the lights ahead, which
I now saw came from a post-chaise standing in the road close by.
Could I summon help from that? Or had the chaise also been stopped
as I was now? Certainly I had run on a nest of highwaymen.</p>

<p>"How many have you?" I asked, choking with indignation. "I'll
give three of you merry gentlemen a chance at me if you will allow
me one dry priming!"</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. The unseen hand that held my horse's
head fell away, and the animal snorted and tossed his mane. Again,
not knowing what to expect, I cautiously felt around until I found
the bridle, and noiselessly began to work it back over Warlock's
head.</p>

<p>"Now for it!" I thought, gathering to launch the horse like a
battering-ram into the unknown ahead.</p>

<p>But just as I drew my light hatchet from my belt and lifted the
bridle, I almost dropped from the saddle to hear a meek and pleading
voice I knew call me by name.</p>

<p>"Jack Mount!" I exclaimed, incredulous even yet.</p>

<p>"The same, Mr. Cardigan, out at heels and elbows, lad, and trimming
the highway for a purse-proud Tory. Are you offended?"</p>

<p>"Offended!" I repeated, hysterically. "Oh no, of course not!"
And I burst into a shout of uncontrollable laughter.</p>

<p>He did not join in. As for me, I lay on my horse's neck, weak
from the reaction of my own laughter, utterly unable to find enough
breath in my body to utter another sound.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can laugh," he said, in a hurt voice. "But I have accomplished
a certain business yonder which has nigh frightened me to death&mdash;that's
all."</p>

<p>"What business?" I asked, weakly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you may well ask. Hell's whippet! I lay here for the fat
bailiff o' Grafton, who should travel to Hadley this night with
Tory funds, and &mdash;I stopped a lady in that post-chaise yonder,
and she's fainted at sight o' me. That's all."</p>

<p>"Fainted?" I repeated. "Where are her post-boys? Where's her
footman? Where's her maid? Is she alone, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Ay," he responded, gloomily; "the men and the maid ran off.
Trust those Dutch patrooners for that sort o' patroonery! If I'd
only had Cade with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;where's the Weasel?"</p>

<p>"I wish I knew," he said, earnestly. "He left me at Johnstown&mdash;went
away&mdash;vanished like a hermit-bird. Oh, I am certainly an unhappy
man and a bungling one at that. You can laugh if you like, but
it's killing me. I wish you would come over to that cursed post-chaise
and see what can be done for the lady. You know about ladies,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do when they faint," I replied.</p>

<p>"There's ways and ways," he responded. "Some say to shake them,
but I can't bring myself to that; some say to pat their chins
and say 'chuck-a-bunny!' but I have no skill for that either.
Do you think&mdash;if we could get her out o' the chaise&mdash;and let her
be rained on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," I said, controlling a violent desire to laugh. "I'll
calm her, Jack. Perhaps she has recovered."</p>

<p>As we advanced through the rain in the dim radiance of the chaise-lamps,
I looked curiously at Mount, and he up at me.</p>

<p>"Lord," he murmured, "how you have changed, lad!"</p>

<p>"You, too," I said, for he was haggard and dirty and truly enough
in rags. No marvel that the lady had fainted at first sight o'
him, let alone his pistol thrust through the chaise-window.</p>

<p>"Poor old Jack," I said, softened by his misery. "Why did you
desert me after you had saved my life? I owe you so much that
it were a charity to aid me discharge the debt&mdash;or as much of
it as I may."</p>

<p>"Ho!" he muttered. "'Twas no debt, lad, and I'm but a pottle-pot
after all. Now, by the ring-tailed coon o' Canada, I care not
what befalls me, for Cade's gone&mdash;or dead&mdash;and I've the heart
of a chipmunk left to face the devil."</p>

<p>"Soft," I whispered; "the lady's astir in her chaise. Wait you
here, Jack! So! &mdash;I dismount. Touch not the horse; he bites
at raggedness; he'll stand; so&mdash;o, Warlock. Wait, my beauty! So&mdash;o."</p>

<p>And I advanced to the chaise-window, cap in hand.</p>

<p>"Madam," I began, very gently, striving to make her out in the
dim light of the chaise; "I perceive some accident has befallen
your carriage. Pray, believe me at your disposal and humbly anxious
to serve you, and if there be aught wherein I may&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Michael Cardigan!" came a startled voice, and I froze dumb in
astonishment. For there, hood thrown back, and earnest, pale face
swiftly leaning into the lamp-rays, I beheld Marie Hamilton.</p>

<p>We stared at each other for a moment, then her lovely face flushed
and she thrust both hands towards me, laughing and crying at the
same moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, the romance of life!" she cried. "I have had such a fright,
my wits ache with the shock! A highwayman, Michael, <em>grand
Dieu!</em>&mdash;here in the rain, pulling the horses up short, and
it was, 'Ho! Stand and deliver!'&mdash;with pistol pushed in my face,
and I to faint&mdash;pretence to gain a wink o' time to think&mdash;not
frightened, but vexed and all on the qui vive to hide my jewels.
Then comes the great booby, aghast to see me fainted, a-muttering
excuse that he meant no harm, and I lying perdu, still as a mouse,
for I had no mind to let him know I heard him. But under my lids
I perceived him, a great, ragged, handsome rascal, badly scared,
for I gathered from his stammering that he was waiting for another
chaise bound for Hadley.</p>

<p>"<em>Vrai Dieu</em>, but I did frighten him well, and now he's
gone, and I in a plight with my cowardly post-boys, maid, and
footman fled, Lord knows whither!"</p>

<p>The amazing rapidity of her chatter confounded me, and she held
my hands the while, and laughed and wept enough to turn her eyes
to twin stars, all dewy in the lamp-shine.</p>

<p>"Dear friend," she sighed; "dear, dear friend, what happiness
to feel I owe my life to you!"</p>

<p>"But you don't," I blurted out; "there never was any danger."</p>

<p>"Lord save the boy!" she murmured. "There is no spark o' romance
in him!" And fell a-laughing in that faint, low mockery that I
remembered on that fatal night at Johnson Hall.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," I said, grimly. "Romance is the breath of
my life, madam. And so I now plead freedom to present to your
good graces my friend, Jack Mount, who lately stopped your coach
upon the King's highway!"</p>

<p>And I caught the abashed giant by his ragged sleeve and dragged
him to the chaise-window, where he plucked off his coon-skin cap
and stared wildly at the astonished lady within.</p>

<p>But it was no easy matter to rout Marie Hamilton. True, she paled
a little, and took one short breath, with her hand to her breast;
then, like sunlight breaking, her bright eyes softened and that
sweet, fresh mouth parted in a smile which spite of me set my
own pulse a quickstep marching.</p>

<p>"I am not angry, sir," she said, mockingly. "All cats are gray
at midnight, and one post-chaise resembles another, Captain Mount&mdash;for
surely, by your exploits, you deserve at least that title."</p>

<p>Mount's fascinated eyes grew bigger. His consternation and the
wild appeal in his eyes set me hard a-swallowing my laughter.
As for Mrs. Hamilton, she smiled her sweet, malicious smile, and
her melting eyes were soft with that false mercy which deludes
apace and welcomes to destruction.</p>

<p>"Jack," said I, smothering my laughter, "do you get your legs
astride the leader, there, and play at post-boy to the nearest
inn. Zounds, man! Don't stand there hanging your jaw like a hard-run
beagle! Up into the saddle with you! Gad, you've a ride before
you with those Albany nags a-biting at your shins! Here, give
me your rifle."</p>

<p>"And you, Michael," asked Mrs. Hamilton, "will you not share
my carriage, for old time's sake?"</p>

<p>I told her I had my horse and would ride him at her chaise-wheels,
and so left her, somewhat coolly, for I liked not that trailing
tail to her invitation&mdash;"for old time's sake."</p>

<p>"What the foul fiend have I to do with 'old time's sake'?" I
muttered, as I slung myself astride o' Warlock and motioned Jack
Mount to move on through the finely falling rain. "'Old time's
sake'! Faith, it once cost me the bitterest day of my life, and
might cost me the love of the sweetest girl in earth or heaven!
'Old time's sake'! Truly, that is no tune to pipe for me; let
others dance to it, not I."</p>

<p>As I rode forward beside her carriage-window, she looked up at
me and made a little gesture of greeting. I bowed in my saddle,
stiffly, for I was now loaded with Mount's rifle as well as my
own.</p>

<p>What the deuce is there about Marie Hamilton that stirs the pulse
of every man who sets eyes on her? Even I, loving Silver Heels
with my whole heart and soul, find subtle danger in the eyes of
Marie Hamilton, and shun her faint smile with the instant instinct
of an anchorite.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was an anchorite, all ashamed, for I would not have
it said of me, for vanity.</p>

<p>In a day when the morals of the world were rotten to the core,
when vice was fashion, and fashion marked all England for her
own, the overflow from those same British islands, flooding our
land, stained most of those among us who could claim the right
to quality.</p>

<p>I never had been lured by those grosser sins which circumstances
offered&mdash;even in our house at Johnstown&mdash;and I would make no merit
of my continence, God wot, seeing there was no temptation.</p>

<p>I had been reared among those whose friends and guests often
went to bed too drunk to snuff their candles; cards and dice and
high play were nothing strange to me, and, perhaps from their
sheer familiarity, left me indifferent and without desire.</p>

<p>A titled drab I had never seen; the gentlemen whom I knew discussed
their mistresses over nuts and wine, seeming to think no shame
of one another for the foolishness they called their "fortune."
Had it not been for Sir William's and Aunt Molly's teachings,
I might have grown up to think that wives were wedded chiefly
to oblige a friend. But Sir William and Aunt Molly taught me to
abhor that universal vice long before I could comprehend it. I
did not clearly comprehend it yet; but the thought of it was stale
ashes in my mouth, so unattractive had I pictured what I needs
must shun one day.</p>

<p>Riding there through the fine rain which I could scarcely feel
on my skin, so delicate were the tiny specks of moisture, I thought
much on the smallness of this our world, where a single hour on
an unknown road had given me two companions whom I knew.</p>

<p>God grant the end of my journey would give me her for whose dear
sake the journey had been made!</p>

<p>Thinking such thoughts, lost in a lover's reverie, I rode on,
blind to all save the sweet ghosts I conjured in my brooding,
and presently was roused to find the chaise turning into a tavern-yard,
where all was black save for a lanthorn moving through the darkness.</p>

<p>Mount called; a yawning ostler came with a light, and at the
same instant our host in shirt and apron toddled out to bid us
welcome, a little, fat, toothless, chattering body, whose bald
head soon was powdered with tiny, shining rain-drops.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton gave me her hand to descend; she was as fresh and
fragrant as a violet, and jumped to the ground on tiptoe with
a quick flirt of her petticoat like the twitch of a robin his
tail-feathers.</p>

<p>"Mad doings on the road, sir!" said our host, rubbing his little,
fat hands. "Chaise and four stopped by the penny-stile two hours
since, sir. Ay, you may smile, my lady, but the post-boys fought
a dreadful battle with the highwaymen swarming in on every side.
You laugh, sir? But I have these same post-boys here, and the
footman, too, to prove it!"</p>

<p>"But, pray, where is the lady and her maid and the chaise and
four?" asked Mrs. Hamilton, demurely.</p>

<p>"God knows," said the innkeeper, rolling his eyes. "The villains
carried it off with the poor lady inside. Mad work, my lady! Mad
work!"</p>

<p>"Maddening work," said I, wrathfully. "Jack, borrow a post-whip
and warm the breeks of those same post-boys, will you? Lay it
on thick, Jack; I'll take my turn in the morning!"</p>

<p>Mount went away towards the stable, and I quieted the astonished
landlord and sent him to prepare supper, while a servant lighted
Mrs. Hamilton to her chamber. Then I went out to see that Warlock
was well fed and bedded fresh; and I did hear sundry howls from
the villain post-boys in their quarters overhead, where Mount
was nothing sparing of the leather.</p>

<p>Presently he came down the ladder, and laughed sheepishly when
he saw me.</p>

<p>"They're well birched," he said. "It's God's mercy if they sit
their saddles in the morning." Then he took my hands and held
them so hard that I winced.</p>

<p>"Gad, I'm that content to see you, lad!" he repeated again and
again.</p>

<p>"And I you, Jack," I said. "It is time, too, else you'd be in
some worse mischief than this night's folly. But I'll take care
of you now," I added, laughing. "Faith, it's turn and turn about,
you know. Come to supper."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I hate to face that lady," he muttered. "No, lad, I'll
sup with my own marrow-bones for company."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" I insisted, but could not budge him, and soon saw
I had my labour for my pains.</p>

<p>"A mule for obstinacy&mdash;a very mule," I muttered.</p>

<p>"I own it; I'm an ass. But this ass knows enough to go to his
proper stall," he said, with a miserable laugh that touched me.</p>

<p>"Have it as you wish, Jack," I said, gently; "but come into my
chamber when you've supped. I'll be there. Lord, what millions
of questions I have to ask!"</p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure," he murmured, then walked away towards
the kitchen, while I returned to the inn and cleansed me of the
stains of travel.</p>

<p>We supped together, Mrs. Hamilton and I, and found the cheer
most comforting, though there was no wine for her and she sipped,
with me, the new brew of dark October ale.</p>

<p>A barley soup we had, then winter squash and a roast wild duck,
with little quails all 'round, and a dish of pepper-cresses. Lord,
how I did eat, being still gaunt from my long sickness! But she
kept pace with me; a wholesome lass was she, and no frail beauty
fed on syllabubs and suckets. Flesh and blood were her charms,
a delicate ripeness, sweet as the cresses she crunched between
her sparkling teeth. And ever I heard her little feet go tap,
tap, tap, under the lamplit table.</p>

<p>I spoke respectfully of her losses; she dropped her eyes, accepting
the condolence, pinching a cress to shreds the while.</p>

<p>She of course knew nothing of my journey to Pittsburg, nor of
any events there which might have occurred after she had left,
when her husband fell with many another stout frontiersman under
Boone and Harrod.</p>

<p>I told her nothing, save that Felicity was in Boston and that
I was journeying thither to see her.</p>

<p>"Is she not to wed the Earl of Dunmore?" asked Mrs. Hamilton.</p>

<p>"No," said I, quietly.</p>

<p>"La, the capricious beauty!" she murmured. "Sure, she has not
thrown over Dunmore for that foolish dragoon, Kent Bevan?"</p>

<p>"I hope not," said I, maliciously.</p>

<p>"Who knows," she mused; "Mr. Bevan is to serve on Gage's staff
this fall. It looks like a match to me."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Bevan going to Boston?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes. Are you jealous?" she replied, saucily.</p>

<p>I smiled and shook my head.</p>

<p>"But you once were in love with your cousin," she persisted.
"<em>On aime sans raison, et sans raison l'on hait! Regardez-moi,
monsieur.</em>"</p>

<p>"Your convent breeding in Saint-Sacrement lends to your tongue
a liberty that English schools withhold," I said, reddening.</p>

<p>"Nay, now," she laughed, "do you remember how you played with
me at that state dinner held in Johnson Hall? You rode me down
rough-shod, Michael, and used me shamefully there, under the stairs."</p>

<p>"I'll do the like again if you provoke me," I said, but had not
meant to say it either, being troubled by her eyes.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the like&mdash;again? And what was that, pray?"</p>

<p>"You know," I said, sulkily.</p>

<p>"I think you&mdash;kissed me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think I did," said I; "and left you all in tears."</p>

<p>It was brutal, but I meant to make an end.</p>

<p>"Did you believe that those were real tears?" she asked, innocently.</p>

<p>"By Heaven, I know they were," said I, with satisfaction, "and
small vengeance to repay the ill you did me, too."</p>

<p>"What ill?" she asked, opening her eyes in real surprise.</p>

<p>But I was silent and ashamed already. Truly, it had been no fault
but my own that I had taken up the gage she flung at me that night
so long ago.</p>

<p>"But I'll not take it up this time," thought I to myself, cracking
filberts and looking at her askance across the table.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, Michael," she said, with a faint smile,
ending in a sigh.</p>

<p>"Nor I you, bonnie Marie Hamilton," said I. "Suppose we both
cry quits?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," she said; "I have a little score with you, unsettled."</p>

<p>"What score?" I asked, smiling. "Cannot you appeal to the law
to have it settled?"</p>

<p>"<em>La loi permet souvent ce que défend l'honneur</em>," she
said, with an innocent emphasis which left me sitting there, uncertain
whether to laugh or blush. What the mischief did she mean, anyhow?</p>

<p>She picked up a filbert, tasted the kernel, dropped it, clasped
her hands, elbows on the cloth, and gave me a malicious sidelong
glance which still was full of that strange sweetness that ever
set me on my guard, half angry, half bewitched.</p>

<p>"I wish you would let me alone!" I blurted out, like a country
yokel at a quilting.</p>

<p>"I won't," she said.</p>

<p>"Remember what you suffered the first time!" I warned her.</p>

<p>"I do remember."</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;do you dare risk that?" I stammered.</p>

<p>"<em>Et d'avantage&mdash;encore</em>," she murmured, setting her teeth
on her plump white wrist and watching me uncertainly.</p>

<p>The game was running on too fast for me and my pulse was keeping
pace.</p>

<p>"Safely they defy who challenge those in chains," I said, commanding
my voice with an effort. "If that is your revenge, I cry you mercy;
you have won."</p>

<p>After a long silence she raised her eyes, dancing with a mocking
light in each starry pupil.</p>

<p>"I give you joy, Michael," she said, "if, as I take it, these
same chains and fetters that you lately wear are riveted by Cupid."</p>

<p>But I answered nothing, attending her to the door, where she
dropped me what I do believe was the slowest and lowest curtsey
ever dropped by woman.</p>

<p>So I to my own chamber in no amiable frame of mind, and still
tingling with the strange charm of my encounter. Head bent, hands
clasped behind me, I walked the floor, striving to analyze this
woman who had now twice crossed me on the trail of fate, this
fair woman whose bright eyes were a menace and a challenge, and
whose sweet, curved mouth was set there as eternal provocation
to saint and sinner.</p>

<p>Thus for the first time in my life I had known what temptation
might have been. Nay, I knew a little more than what it <em>might
have</em> been, and, in the overwhelming flood of loyalty to Silver
Heels, I cursed myself for a man without faith or shred of honour.
For I was too unskilled in combats with the fair temptation to
understand that it is no disgrace to falter, yet not fall.</p>

<p>There came a timid scratching at the door; I opened it and Mount
sidled in, coy as a cat in a dairy with its chin still wet with
cream. He regarded me doubtfully, but sat down when bidden and
began to complain:</p>

<p>"Now, if you are minded to chide me for taking the road, I'm
going out again. I can't bear any more, lad, that I can't!&mdash;what
with Cade gone and me in rags, and stopping Councillor Bullock
near Johnstown with pockets bare of aught but a cursed sixpence
and that crooked as Lady Shelton's legs&mdash;and now I must needs
fright a lady into a faint like a bad boy with a jack-o'-lanthorn&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter with you?" I broke in, peevishly.
"I'm not finding fault, Jack. If you mean to spend your life in
endeavours to impoverish every Tory magistrate in America, it's
your affair, and I can't help it, though you must know as well
as I that there's a carpenter's tree and a rope at the end of
your frolic."</p>

<p>"No, there isn't," he said, hastily. "I'm done with the highway
save to pat it smooth with my feet. Lord, lad, it's not for the
money, but for sport. And soon there'll be fighting enough to
fill my stomach; mark me, the crocus that buds white this spring
will wither red as blood ere its fouled petals fall!"</p>

<p>"War?" I asked, thrilling to hear him.</p>

<p>He rose and gazed at me most earnestly.</p>

<p>"Ay, surely, surely in the spring. Gad! Boston is that surfeited
with redcoats now that when they cram down more next spring she
can but throw them up to keep her health. Wait! Boston is sick
in bone and body, but in the spring she takes her purge. Oh, I
know," he cried, with a strange, prophetic stare in his eyes;
"I have word from Shemuel. Now he's off to Boston with the news
from Cresap. And I tell you, lad, that the first half-moon of
April will start a devil loose in this broad land that state or
clergy cannot exorcise!</p>

<p>"Not a devil," he corrected himself, slowly, "no, not a thing
from hell, but that same swift angel sent to chasten worlds with
fire. Dunmore will burn, and Butler. As for the rest, the honest,
the rascals, the witless, the soulless, thieves, poltroons, usurers,
and the vast army of well-meaning loyal fools, they will be cleared
out o' this our world-wide temple whose roof is the sky and whose
pillars are our high pines!&mdash;cleared out, scoured out, uprooted,
driven forth like those same money-changers in the temple scourged
by Christ,&mdash;and God is witness I, a sinner, mean no blasphemy,
spite of all the sweating load o' guilt I bear."</p>

<p>"Where got you such phrases, Jack?" I asked. "It is not Jack
Mount who speaks to me like a crazed preacher in the South who
shouts the slaves around him to repent."</p>

<p>Mount looked at me; the dazed, fanatic light in his eyes faded
slowly.</p>

<p>"I have a book here," he muttered, "a book I purchased in Johnstown
of a man who sold many to patriots. Doubtless grief for Cade and
my privations and my conning this same book while starving make
me light-headed yet."</p>

<p>"What book is that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"<em>The Rights of Man.</em>"</p>

<p>"I, also, would be glad to read it."</p>

<p>"Read, lad. 'Tis fodder for King George's cattle&mdash;such as we.
And the little calves our wenches cast, they, too, shall feed
on it, though they cannot utter moo! for their own mothers' milk!"</p>

<p>"Jack, Jack," I cried, "you are strangely changed! I do not know
you in this bitter mood, and your mouth full o' words that burn
your silly lips. Wake to life, man! Gay! Gay! Jack! A pest on
books and those who write 'em! I have ever despised your printed
stuff, and damme if I'll sit and hear it through your lips!"</p>

<p>But it was like rousing a man from a sleeping-draught, for the
book had so bewitched his senses in these long weeks he had wandered
alone that I had all I could do to drag him out of his strange,
dreamy enthusiasms, back into his old, guileless, sunny, open-hearted
self. And I feel sure that I could not have succeeded at all had
not the shock of his encounter with Mrs. Hamilton on the highway
first scared him back to partial common-sense. Added to this my
entreaties, and he became docile, and then, little by little,
dropped his preacher's mad harangue to talk like a reasonable
creature and wag his tongue unlarded with his garbled metaphors
and his half-baked parables which no doubt no simple forest-runner
could digest on the raw printed page. I pitied him sincerely.
Truly, a little learning makes one wondrous kind.</p>

<p>I put the book in my shirt-front, meaning to be of those who
ride and read, even as Jack was of those others who both read
and run.</p>

<p>"Why did you desert me, Jack?" I asked, sitting chin on hand
to watch him smoke the pipe which no kind fate had filled for
him since he left Johnstown.</p>

<p>"Faith, I hung about with Cade, doing no harm, sitting in the
sun to wait for news from you. Mr. Duncan, a kind officer, gave
us news and made us welcome on the benches in front of the guard-house.
And Mistress Warren would have us to eat with her&mdash;only I was
ashamed. But Cade went and supped with her.</p>

<p>"Lad, Sir John Johnson is not a gentleman I should grow too fond
of. His courtesy is a shallow spring, I'm thinking, dry at the
first taste, and over-sour to suit my teeth."</p>

<p>"What did Sir John do?" I asked, growing red. "Surely he thanked
you and Cade for saving his kinsman's life; surely he made you
welcome at the Hall, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Surely, he did nothing of the kind," grunted Mount, puffing
his pipe. "Sir John sent word to the guard that we had best find
quarters in Johnstown taverns and not set the hounds barking in
his kennels."</p>

<p>It was like a blow in the face to me. Jack saw it and laughed.</p>

<p>"It's not your fault," he said; "show me two eggs and I'll name
two birds, but I won't swear they'll fight alike. If he's your
kin, it's to be borne, lad, and that's all there is to it."</p>

<p>I set my teeth and swallowed my shame.</p>

<p>"So we went to Rideup's old camp," he continued; "a fair inn
where a man may drink to whom he pleases and no questions asked
nor any yokel to bawl 'God save the King!' or turn your ale sour
with Tory whining. And there I lay and&mdash;tippled, lad. I'll not
deny it, no! Like a fish in sweet water my gills did open and
shut while the ale flowed into me, day and night perdu.</p>

<p>"Cade never drank. God! how that man changed&mdash;since he saw your
sweet Mistress Warren there on the hillock at Roanoke Plain! Mad,
lad, quite mad. But such a dear, good comrade&mdash;I &mdash;I can
scarce speak o' him but I wink with tears."</p>

<p>The great fellow dug one fist into his eyes, and then the other,
replacing his pipe in his mouth with an unmistakable snivel.</p>

<p>"Quite mad, Mr. Cardigan. He thought he saw his little daughter
in Miss Warren, without offence to any one in all the world and
least of all to you, and he waited all day to see her come out
to the guard-house and give the news of your sick-bed to your
Lieutenant Duncan. So one day, when you were surely out of danger
and ready to fatten, comes Cade to the tavern and bids me good-bye,
talking wildly of his lost daughter, and I, Heaven help me, lay
abed with my head like a top all humming for the ale I'd had,
and thinking nothing of what he said save that his madness grew
apace.</p>

<p>"And that night he went away while I slept in my cups. When he
came not I hunted the town for him as I had never hunted trail
in all my life before. And I warrant you I left no stone unturned
in that same town. I was half-crazy; I could not think he'd left
me there of his own free will. Many a fight I had with the soldiers,
many a bruise and broken head I left behind me ere I shook my
moccasins free o' dust in Johnstown streets. They'll tell you,
and that fat, purple-pitted councillor &mdash;Bullock, I mean&mdash;why,
he would have me jailed for a matter of damaging his Tory constable.
So I gave him a fright on the highway and left your Tryon County
for a quieter one. That's all, lad."</p>

<p>What he had told me of Cade Renard troubled me. If Felicity had
been strangely lost to her own family, and had been restored,
doubtless she was now happy and full of wonder for the dear, amazing
chance that had brought to her those honoured parents she had
so long deemed to be with God. Yet she must be shy and over-sensitive
also, having been brought up to believe she had no nearer kin
than Sir Peter Warren. And now that he, after all, was no kin
to her, nor she to us, if a mad forest-runner like Cade Renard
should come to vex her with his luny fancies, it might hurt her
or seem like reproach and mockery for her new parents.</p>

<p>"Do you think Cade followed Miss Warren to Boston?" I asked.</p>

<p>"My journey is to find that out," he said. "Ah, lad, a noble
mind was wrecked in Renard's head. <em>I</em> know&mdash;others know
nothing. What fate sent him like a wild thing to the forests,
I only know, as you know, nothing but what he has told us both.
If his madness has waxed so fiercely since he saw Miss Warren,
it may be a sign that the end is near. I do not know. I miss him,
and I must look for him while I can move these clumsy feet of
mine."</p>

<p>My candle was burning very low now. Mount laid his pipe in the
candle-pan, rose, shook himself, and said good-night.</p>

<p>"Good-night," I said, and sat down to light another candle. This
done, I did undress me, and so would have been in bed had I not
chanced to open the book he left me, thinking to glance it over
and forget it.</p>

<p>But sunrise found me poring over its pages, while the candle,
a pool o' wax, hardened in the candle-stick beside me.</p>
