<p>The keen eyes, instead of looking at the crest of the rocky ridge
on his right, were now centred on the ground, where they detected
a small dark speck swiftly approaching the horseman. At the first
glance, the object suggested a cannon-ball rolling with great
speed toward the pony, that was now standing still, with head
erect, ears thrown forward, and the appearance of perplexed interest
in the thing, whatever it might be.</p>

<p>For a minute Warren Starr was unable to guess the meaning of
the singular sight. Whatever its nature, it was evident that it
was aiming to reach the rider with the least possible delay. The
latter drew his Winchester around in front, so as to be ready
to receive it, his first thought being that it was some Sioux
stratagem designed to do him ill.</p>

<p>But while he gazed, he discovered its identity; it was a dog,
running as if its very life were at stake. The next instant young
Starr perceived something protruding from the front part of its
body, resembling the ornamental feather in an Indian's head-dress.</p>

<p>"It is an arrow!" he exclaimed. "The poor creature is badly wounded,
and is striving to reach me before he dies. By gracious, it's
Bruno!" he added, as a closer approach enabled him to identify
the creature. "He brings me some message."</p>

<p>Bruno was his favorite hound, that had accompanied him on many
a hunting excursion, and whom he loved scarcely less than Jack,
his pony.</p>

<p>It was indeed a race with death on the part of the faithful animal.
While yet a number of rods distant, he staggered, faltered, then
gathering his energies pressed on with the last strength he could
summon, and with a low moan rolled languidly on his side, and
looking upward with a human expression to his young master, said
by his action: "I have done the best I could for you, and I am
content."</p>

<p>Young Starr was out of the saddle like a flash, and ran forward
to him. Stooping down, he placed one arm under the head of the
noble dog, and, leaning over, touched his lips to the velvety
forehead.</p>

<p>"My poor Bruno, they have killed you!" he murmured, with tears
in his eyes. "I would give an arm to save you, but it is too late."</p>

<p>He saw that the head of the arrow was sunken deep into the neck,
and the dark coat was splashed with crimson. To attempt to withdraw
the missile was useless. It could only deepen the agony of the
animal without relieving him in the least. He was doomed and dying
before he sank to the ground.</p>

<p>Bruno turned his beautiful eyes upward to his master, emitted
a low moan, gave a slight quiver and gasp, and was dead. No martyr
ever did his duty more heroically.</p>

<p>For a few moments Warren Starr yielded to his grief. He remained
with the exquisitely formed head resting on his arm, while the
tears fell from his eyes on the form that could never respond
again to his caresses. Then he gently withdrew his arm and suffered
the head to rest on the ground.</p>

<p>"Your last act was for those you love," he murmured; "you gave
your life for us, and no man could do more. No one shall take
from me the faith that we shall be happy together beyond the grave.
Good-by, my true and faithful friend."</p>

<p>Young Starr was too experienced a scout, despite his youth, to
forget in his grief the full significance of the sad incident.
The hound had travelled the long distance from the ranch to this
point for the purpose of bringing him a message. He had been discovered
while on the road, and fired upon by the Indians, who were so
near that they used bows and arrows to prevent the young master
taking the alarm. Many missiles were doubtless sent after the
animal, and one was fated to bring him down, though not until
he had accomplished his errand.</p>

<p>Warren knew where to look for the message. He unstrapped the
collar, with its silver plate&mdash;which he would have done under
any circumstance to keep as a remembrance of his voiceless friend&mdash;and
there, carefully folded and secure under the band, was a piece
of paper, containing considerable writing in lead-pencil:</p>

<p>
<em>DEAR WARREN</em>:

</p>
<p>
Don't come to the ranch. It is sure death to undertake it. A party<br/>
of twenty and more bucks are near us. They have killed or stampeded<br/>
our cattle, and will attack us this evening if we remain, which we<br/>
shall not do. Tim discovered them this afternoon, and learned<br/>
enough to make sure of their intention. We shall mount our horses<br/>
and start for Fort Meade. We dare not use the regular trail, along<br/>
which I suppose you are making your way, but must be guided by<br/>
circumstances. I think we shall move to the westward, taking the<br/>
most direct route to the post, but are likely to be forced into a<br/>
long detour, which renders it impossible for me to give you any<br/>
direction by which we can meet each other.

</p>
<p>
I know that your impulse will be to try to join us before we reach<br/>
the fort, but it is my earnest wish that you shall not attempt it.<br/>
Turn about at once, while you have time, and retrace your steps. If<br/>
a day or two shall pass without our coming in, perhaps it may be<br/>
well to ask the colonel to send out a squad of cavalry to help us,<br/>
for it is idle to fancy we are not in great peril. It is my prayer<br/>
that Bruno shall intercept you in time to prevent any mishap. I<br/>
have instructed him precisely what he is expected to do, and he not<br/>
only fully understands, but, as you well know, will do it if it be<br/>
possible.

</p>
<p>
<em>YOUR FATHER</em>.

</p>

<p>"You were right," said the youth gently, looking down once more
on the inanimate form. "Bruno did his duty, and he deserves a
monument for having done it so well."</p>

<p>All this time the pony stood some feet away, motionless, and
apparently a deeply interested witness of the singular scene.</p>

<p>He was too well trained to leave his master, who never resorted
to the precaution of securing him by his halter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile night was closing in. The gloom was overspreading the
prairie so that the ridge, which had been such a cause for solicitude
to the youth, was now dimly discernible. In a few minutes it would
be swallowed up in the coming darkness.</p>

<p>Resolutely forcing his sadness aside, Warren knelt down and pressed
his ear to the ground. If horsemen were approaching he could detect
it through the sense of hearing.</p>

<p>Then he climbed once more into the saddle and faced the ridge,
debating with himself what was the right course to pursue. His
father had said in unmistakable language that he wished him to
return to Fort Meade. Warren was a dutiful son, but he could not
persuade himself that that was the best thing to do. To follow
his parent's wishes would require him to look after his own safety,
and to forget those whose lives were dearer to him than his own.
To return to the fort, and secure the aid that he knew would be
cheerfully given, would take a day or two, during which the crisis
must come and pass with his people. Two days at the most would
settle the question whether they were to escape or fall victims
to the ferocity of the Sioux.</p>

<p>"I can't do it," he said, compressing his lips and shaking his
head. "I have never played the coward, and I'm not going to begin
when my folks are concerned. My first duty is to find out where
father, mother, and Dot are, and then do all I can for their safety."</p>

<p>It was not difficult to reach this conclusion, for which no one
will deny him credit; but it was altogether a difficult and formidable
task for him to decide what next to do.</p>

<p>Had his friends been following the regular trail to the fort
his course would have been simple, since he had only to continue
on until he met them; but his father had notified him that not
only would he not take that route, but he could not say which
one he would adopt. He inclined to think he would turn to the
westward, leaving the path on his left, but the question, as he
said, must be settled by circumstances.</p>

<p>Something cold touched his hand. It was a snowflake, and he knew
that in a short time the ground would be wrapped in a mantle of
white. Once more he glanced in the direction of the elevation,
now invisible in the gathering darkness. On the utmost height
a point of light appeared, shining for a moment with the steady
radiance of a fixed star.</p>

<p>"The bucks are there," concluded Warren; "they saw me from a
long way, and must wonder why I am delayed&mdash;ah, sure enough!"</p>

<p>All at once the gleaming light began circling about, faster and
faster, until it looked like a wheel of fire. Then it reversed,
whirling as swiftly in the opposite direction, then up and down,
then from side to side, and finally, whiff! it vanished.</p>

<p>A grim smile lit the face of the youth, who turned his gaze toward
the more distant ridge on his left for the answer, but if it was
made, the state of the atmosphere prevented his seeing it. Once
he fancied he caught the glimpse of something resembling a fire-fly,
but it was only for an instant, and was not observed again.</p>

<p>It was easy to read the meaning of that which first showed itself.
A party of Indians that had evidently been watching his coming,
while yet a long way off, now telegraphed his arrival to their
confederates on the more distant elevation, together with the
fact that the white man had ceased his approach and might not
come any nearer.</p>

<p>It was reasonable to believe that these same red men would not
remain idle while the object of their wrath turned quietly about
and retraced his steps.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes were used in considering the question, but
the time had not yet expired, when, to Warren's astonishment,
he heard the sound of firing ahead. Probably eight or ten shots
were discharged at quick but irregular intervals, and then all
once more became still.</p>

<p>A pang of apprehension passed through him at the fear that his
friends, after all, might have attempted to reach the fort by
the trail, and had become involved in a fight with the Sioux.
Be that as it may, the fact was impressed on him that he was doing
an imprudent thing by remaining in the path along which the warriors
were liable to burst at any moment. He turned Jack to the left
and rode fully a hundred yards before again drawing rein. It was
not necessary to go this far to place himself beyond sight of
the path, but he wished to take no unnecessary chances.</p>

<p>By this time the snowflakes were falling fast, and it was impossible
to see objects more than twenty feet distant. Warren checked his
pony, holding him with his nose toward the trail, and listened.</p>

<p>Again the intelligent animal elevated his head, pricked his ears,
and emitted an almost noiseless neigh, as was his habit when he
discovered the approach of strangers. His rider could discern
nothing through the gloom, and resorted to the resource tried
before, which is a common one among hunters and warriors. Descending
from the saddle, he brushed aside the snow from a small spot on
the ground and pressed his ear against the earth.</p>

<p>This time he <em>did</em> hear something. A horse was approaching
over the trail on a swift gallop, and it took but a brief while
for the youth to learn that he was coming from the direction of
the ridge. Furthermore, there was but the single horseman; or,
if there were others, they were so far off that no thought need
be given to them.</p>

<p>Remounting his pony, Warren held him facing the path, and prepared
for any emergency likely to arise. He was well aware that if the
stranger kept to the trail he would be invisible in the gloom,
but he was now so near that from his seat young Starr plainly
caught the sound of his horse's hoofs, growing more distinct every
moment.</p>

<p>Whoever it was that was advancing, it was evident he was doing
so at what might be called a leisurely pace, though it was quite
rapid. The horse was on an easy canter, such as his species can
maintain for hours without fatigue.</p>

<p>The youth was sitting in this posture, with never a thought of
what was coming, when to his amazement he caught the outlines
of the man and his steed passing at right angles to the course
he had been following himself.</p>

<p>"He is off the trail!" was the alarming fact which caused Warren
to make ready to fire, for the truth was apparent that if he saw
the stranger, the latter had the same opportunity of seeing him.</p>

<p>To his surprise Jack uttered a neigh at the critical moment when
the other was directly opposite. A collision now seemed certain,
but the other kept straight on, and quickly passed from sight.</p>

<p>Not until he had been several minutes beyond hearing did the
startling thought come to Warren Starr:</p>

<p>"That was a white man, and not an Indian."</p>
