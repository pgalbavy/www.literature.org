<P>
ISABEL looked down at the letter in her hand--considered it in
silence--and turned to Moody. "I feel tempted to open it
already," she said.
<P>
"After giving your promise?" Moody gently remonstrated.
<P>
Isabel met that objection with a woman's logic.
<P>
"Does a promise matter?" she asked, "when one gives it to a
dirty, disreputable, presuming old wretch like Mr. Sharon? It's a
wonder to me that you trust such a creature. _I_ wouldn't!"
<P>
"I doubted him just as you do," Moody answered, "when I first saw
him in company with Mr. Troy. But there was something in the
advice he gave us at that first consultation which altered my
opinion of him for the better. I dislike his appearance and his
manners as much as you do--I may even say I felt ashamed of
bringing such a person to see you. And yet I can't think that I
have acted unwisely in employing Mr. Sharon."
<P>
Isabel listened absently. She had something more to say, and she
was considering how she should say it. "May I ask you a bold
question?" she began.
<P>
"Any question you like."
<P>
"Have you--" she hesitated and looked embarrassed. "Have you paid
Mr. Sharon much money?" she resumed, suddenly rallying her
courage. Instead of answering, Moody suggested that it was time
to think of returning to Miss Pink's villa. "Your aunt may be
getting anxious about you." he said.
<P>
Isabel led the way out of the farmhouse in silence. She reverted
to Mr. Sharon and the money, however, as they returned by the
path across the fields.
<P>
"I am sure you will not be offended with me," she said gently,
"if I own that I am uneasy about the expense. I am allowing you
to use your purse as if it was mine--and I have hardly any
savings of my own."
<P>
Moody entreated her not to speak of it. "How can I put my money
to a better use than in serving your interests?" he asked. "My
one object in life is to relieve you of your present anxieties. I
shall be the happiest man living if you only owe a moment's
happiness to my exertions!"
<P>
Isabel took his hand, and looked at him with grateful tears in
her eyes.
<P>
"How good you are to me, Mr. Moody!" she said. "I wish I could
tell you how deeply I feel your kindness."
<P>
"You can do it easily," he answered, with a smile. "Call me
'Robert' --don't call me 'Mr. Moody.' "
<P>
She took his arm with a sudden familiarity that charmed him. "If
you had been my brother I should have called you 'Robert,' " she
said; "and no brother could have been more devoted to me than you
are."
<P>
He looked eagerly at her bright face turned up to his. "May I
never hope to be something nearer and dearer to you than a
brother?" he asked timidly.
<P>
She hung her head and said nothing. Moody's memory recalled
Sharon's coarse reference to her "sweetheart." She had blushed
when he put the question? What had she done when Moody put _his_
question? Her face answered for her--she had turned pale; she was
looking more serious than usual. Ignorant as he was of the ways
of women, his instinct told him that this was a bad sign. Surely
her rising color would have confessed it, if time and gratitude
together were teaching her to love him? He sighed as the
inevitable conclusion forced itself on his mind.
<P>
"I hope I have not offended you?" he said sadly.
<P>
"Oh, no."
<P>
"I wish I had not spoken. Pray don't think that I am serving you
with any selfish motive."
<P>
"I don't think that, Robert. I never could think it of _you_."
<P>
He was not quite satisfied yet. "Even if you were to marry some
other man," he went on earnestly, "it would make no difference in
what I am trying to do for you. No matter what I might suffer, I
should still go on--for your sake."
<P>
"Why do you talk so?" she burst out passionately. "No other man
has such a claim as you to my gratitude and regard. How can you
let such thoughts come to you? I have done nothing in secret. I
have no friends who are not known to you. Be satisfied with that,
Robert--and let us drop the subject."
<P>
"Never to take it up again?" he asked, with the infatuated
pertinacity of a man clinging to his last hope.
<P>
At other times and under other circumstances, Isabel might have
answered him sharply. She spoke with perfect gentleness now.
<P>
"Not for the present," she said. "I don't know my own heart. Give
me time."
<P>
His gratitude caught at those words, as the drowning man is said
to catch at the proverbial straw. He lifted her hand, and
suddenly and fondly pressed his lips on it. She showed no
confusion. Was she sorry for him, poor wretch!--and was that all?
<P>
They walked on, arm-in-arm, in silence.
<P>
Crossing the last field, they entered again on the high road
leading to the row of villas in which Miss Pink lived. The minds
of both were preoccupied. Neither of them noticed a gentleman
approaching on horseback, followed by a mounted groom. He was
advancing slowly, at the walking-pace of his horse, and he only
observed the two foot-passengers when he was close to them.
<P>
"Miss Isabel!"
<P>
She started, looked up, and discovered--Alfred Hardyman.
<P>
He was dressed in a perfectly-made travelling suit of light
brown, with a peaked felt hat of a darker shade of the same
color, which, in a picturesque sense, greatly improved his
personal appearance. His pleasure at discovering Isabel gave the
animation to his features which they wanted on ordinary
occasions. He sat his horse, a superb hunter, easily and
gracefully. His light amber-colored gloves fitted him perfectly.
His obedient servant, on another magnificent horse, waited behind
him. He looked the impersonation of rank and breeding--of wealth
and prosperity. What a contrast, in a woman's eyes, to the shy,
pale, melancholy man, in the ill-fitting black clothes, with the
wandering, uneasy glances, who stood beneath him, and felt, and
showed that he felt, his inferior position keenly! In spite of
herself, the treacherous blush flew over Isabel's face, in
Moody's presence, and with Moody's eyes distrustfully watching
her.
<P>
"This is a piece of good fortune that I hardly hoped for," said
Hardyman, his cool, quiet, dreary way of speaking quickened as
usual, in Isabel's presence. "I only got back from France this
morning, and I called on Lady Lydiard in the hope of seeing you.
She was not at home--and you were in the country--and the
servants didn't know the address. I could get nothing out of
them, except that you were on a visit to a relation." He looked
at Moody while he was speaking. "Haven't I seen you before?" he
said, carelessly. "Yes; at Lady Lydiard's. You're her steward,
are you not? How d'ye do?" Moody, with h is eyes on the ground,
answered silently by a bow. Hardyman, perfectly indifferent
whether Lady Lydiard's steward spoke or not, turned on his saddle
and looked admiringly at Isabel. "I begin to think I am a lucky
man at last," he went on with a smile. "I was jogging along to my
farm, and despairing of ever seeing Miss Isabel again--and Miss
Isabel herself meets me at the roadside! I wonder whether you are
as glad to see me as I am to see you? You won't tell me--eh? May
I ask you something else? Are you staying in our neighborhood?"
<P>
There was no alternative before Isabel but to answer this last
question. Hardyman had met her out walking, and had no doubt
drawn the inevitable inference--although he was too polite to say
so in plain words.
<P>
"Yes, sir," she answered, shyly, "I am staying in this
neighborhood."
<P>
"And who is your relation?" Hardyman proceeded, in his easy,
matter-of-course way. "Lady Lydiard told me, when I had the
pleasure of meeting you at her house, that you had an aunt living
in the country. I have a good memory, Miss Isabel, for anything
that I hear about You! It's your aunt, isn't it? Yes? I know
everybody about hew. What is your aunt's name?"
<P>
Isabel, still resting her hand on Robert's arm, felt it tremble a
little as Hardyman made this last inquiry. If she had been
speaking to one of her equals she would have known how to dispose
of the question without directly answering it. But what could she
say to the magnificent gentleman on the stately horse? He had
only to send his servant into the village to ask who the young
lady from London was staying with, and the answer, in a dozen
mouths at least, would direct him to her aunt. She cast one
appealing look at Moody and pronounced the distinguished name of
Miss Pink.
<P>
"Miss Pink?" Hardyman repeated. "Surely I know Miss Pink?" (He
had not the faintest remembrances of her.) "Where did I meet her
last?" (He ran over in his memory the different local festivals
at which strangers had been introduced to him.) "Was it at the
archery meeting? or at the grammar-school when the prizes were
given? No? It must have been at the flower show, then, surely?"
<P>
It _had_ been at the flower show. Isabel had heard it from Miss
Pink fifty times at least, and was obliged to admit it now.
<P>
"I am quite ashamed of never having called," Hardyman proceeded.
"The fact is, I have so much to do. I am a bad one at paying
visits. Are you on your way home? Let me follow you and make my
apologies personally to Miss Pink."
<P>
Moody looked at Isabel. It was only a momentary glance, but she
perfectly understood it.
<P>
"I am afraid, sir, my aunt cannot have the honor of seeing you
to-day," she said.
<P>
Hardyman was all compliance. He smiled and patted his horse's
neck. "To-morrow, then," he said. "My compliments, and I will
call in the afternoon. Let me see: Miss Pink lives at--?" He
waited, as if he expected Isabel to assist his treacherous memory
once more. She hesitated again. Hardyman looked round at his
groom. The groom could find out the address, even if he did not
happen to know it already. Besides, there was the little row of
houses visible at the further end of the road. Isabel pointed to
the villas, as a necessary concession to good manners, before the
groom could anticipate her. "My aunt lives there, sir; at the
house called The Lawn."
<P>
"Ah! to be sure!" said Hardyman. "I oughtn't to have wanted
reminding; but I have so many things to think of at the farm. And
I am afraid I must be getting old--my memory isn't as good as it
was. I am so glad to have seen you, Miss Isabel. You and your
aunt must come and look at my horses. Do you like horses? Are you
fond of riding? I have a quiet roan mare that is used to carrying
ladies; she would be just the thing for you. Did I beg you to
give my best compliments to your aunt? Yes? How well you are
looking! our air here agrees with you. I hope I haven't kept you
standing too long? I didn't think of it in the pleasure of
meeting you. Good-by, Miss Isabel; good-by, till to-morrow!"
<P>
He took off his hat to Isabel, nodded to Moody, and pursued his
way to the farm.
<P>
Isabel looked at her companion. His eyes were still on the
ground. Pale, silent, motionless, he waited by her like a dog,
until she gave the signal of walking on again towards the house.
<P>
"You are not angry with me for speaking to Mr. Hardyman?" she
asked, anxiously.
<P>
He lifted his head it the sound of her voice. "Angry with you, my
dear! why should I be angry?"
<P>
"You seem so changed, Robert, since we met Mr. Hardyman. I
couldn't help speaking to him--could I?"
<P>
"Certainly not."
<P>
They moved on towards the villa. Isabel was still uneasy. There
was something in Moody's silent submission to all that she said
and all that she did which pained and humiliated her. "You're not
jealous?" she said, smiling timidly.
<P>
He tried to speak lightly on his side. "I have no time to be
jealous while I have your affairs to look after," he answered.
<P>
She pressed his arm tenderly. "Never fear, Robert, that new
friends will make me forget the best and dearest friend who is
now at my side." She paused, and looked up at him with a
compassionate fondness that was very pretty to see. "I can keep
out of the way to-morrow, when Mr. Hardyman calls," she said. "It
is my aunt he is coming to see--not me."
<P>
It was generously meant. But while her mind was only occupied
with the present time, Moody's mind was looking into the future.
He was learning the hard lesson of self-sacrifice already. "Do
what you think is right," he said quietly; "don't think of me."
<P>
They reached the gate of the villa. He held out his hand to say
good-by.
<P>
"Won't you come in?" she asked. "Do come in!"
<P>
"Not now, my dear. I must get back to London as soon as I can.
There is some more work to be done for you, and the sooner I do
it the better."
<P>
She heard his excuse without heeding it.
<P>
"You are not like yourself, Robert," she said. "Why is it? What
are you thinking of?"
<P>
He was thinking of the bright blush that overspread her face when
Hardyman first spoke to her; he was thinking of the invitation to
her to see the stud-farm, and to ride the roan mare; he was
thinking of the utterly powerless position in which he stood
towards Isabel and towards the highly-born gentleman who admired
her. But he kept his doubts and fears to himself. "The train
won't wait for me," he said, and held out his hand once more.
<P>
She was not only perplexed; she was really distressed. "Don't
take leave of me in that cold way!" she pleaded. Her eyes dropped
before his, and her lips trembled a little. "Give me a kiss,
Robert, at parting." She said those bold words softly and sadly,
out of the depth of her pity for him. He started; his face
brightened suddenly; his sinking hope rose again. In another
moment the change came; in another moment he understood her. As
he touched her cheek with his lips, he turned pale again. "Don't
quite forget me," he said, in low, faltering tones--and left her.
<P>
Miss Pink met Isabel in the hall. Refreshed by unbroken repose,
the ex-schoolmistress was in the happiest frame of mind for the
reception of her niece's news.
<P>
Informed that Moody had travelled to South Morden to personally
report the progress of the inquiries, Miss Pink highly approved
of him as a substitute for Mr. Troy. "Mr. Moody, as a banker's
son, is a gentleman by birth," she remarked; "he has
condescended, in becoming Lady Lydiard's steward. What I saw of
him, when he came here with you, prepossessed me in his favor. He
has my confidence, Isabel, as well as yours--he is in every
respect a superior person to Mr. Troy. Did you meet any friends,
my dear, when you were out walking?"
<P>
The answer to this question produced a species of transformation
in Miss Pink. The rapturous rank-worship of her nation feasted,
so to speak, on Hardyman's message. She looked taller and younger
than usual--she was all smiles and sweetness. "At last, Isabel,
you have seen birth and breeding under their right aspect," she
said. "In the society of Lady Lydiard, you cannot possibly have
formed correct ideas of the English aristocracy. Observe Mr.
Hardyman when he does me the honor to call to-morrow--and you
will see the difference."
<P>
"Mr. Hardyman is your visitor, aunt--not mine. I was going to ask
you to let me remain upstairs in my room."
<P>
Miss Pink was unaffectedly shocked. "This is what you learn at
Lady Lydiard's!" she observed. "No, Isabel, your absence would be
a breach of good manners--I cannot possibly permit it. You will
be present to receive our distinguished friend with me. And mind
this!" added Miss Pink, in her most impressive manner, "If Mr.
Hardyman should by any chance ask why you have left Lady Lydiard,
not one word about those disgraceful circumstances which connect
you with the loss of the banknote! I should sink into the earth
if the smallest hint of what has really happened should reach Mr.
Hardyman's ears. My child, I stand towards you in the place of
your lamented mother; I have the right to command your silence on
this horrible subject, and I do imperatively command it."
<P>
In these words foolish Miss Pink sowed the seed for the harvest
of trouble that was soon to come.
