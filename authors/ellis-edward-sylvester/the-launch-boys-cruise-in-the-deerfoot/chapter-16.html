<p>"All you have to do is to get off at Sawyer Island, our next
landing, and walk back to this inlet."</p>

<p>"Can we go by land?" asked Alvin.</p>

<p>"No trouble. There are two or three bridges to cross and you
may have a little tramping to do at the end of your journey, but
it is easy."</p>

<p>"How far is it?"</p>

<p>"Something like three miles&mdash;perhaps a little more."</p>

<p>"That's nothing for us; we shan't mind it."</p>

<p>"It will carry you close to darkness, but that need make no difference.
The sky has cleared somewhat, but I don't believe you will have
any moonlight."</p>

<p>"That may be an advantage; at any rate let us hope so."</p>

<p>Sawyer Island, possibly a tenth as large as Barter, had been
in sight for some time, and the steamer speedily drew up beside
the rather rickety landing. It happened that no passengers and
only a few boxes of freight were taken aboard. Only three persons
left the boat&mdash;the two youths and the gentleman in a gray suit,
who seemed to spend most of his time in reading the Lewiston <em>Journal</em>.
This fact led Alvin and Chester to look at him with some interest.
He carried a small handbag, and appeared to be confused after
stepping ashore. He looked about for a minute or two and then
addressed the agent, an elderly man with a yellow tuft of whiskers
on his chin, no coat or waistcoat, a pair of trousers whose tops
were tucked in his boots, and a single suspender which made the
garments hang lopsided in a seemingly uncomfortable manner.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, friend, but isn't this the Isle of Springs?"</p>

<p>"Not much," replied the agent, with a grin that displayed two
rows of big yellow teeth. "This is Sawyer Island."</p>

<p>"My gracious! you don't say so!" exclaimed the new arrival in
no little astonishment. "How is that?"</p>

<p>"It's 'cause it happens to be so; can't you read?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by such a question?"</p>

<p>"There are the words painted on the front of that shanty in big
enough letters to read as fur as you can see 'em."</p>

<p>The man glared at them.</p>

<p>"Was there ever such stupidity? If I signalled the steamer do
you think she would come back and take me up?"</p>

<p>"I rayther think not, but you might try it."</p>

<p>And he did try it. Snatching off his hat he swung it over his
head and shouted at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>"Hold on there! You've left me behind! Come back!"</p>

<p>Several deck hands on the boat must have seen the frantic passenger,
who ran to the edge of the wharf, and added his handbag to the
circlings, while he kept up his shoutings. Alvin and Chester,
as much amused as the agent, fancied they could see the grins
on the faces of several of the men on the steamer. One of them
waggishly crooked a forefinger as an invitation for him to come
aboard, but none the less the boat steamed straight on to the
Isle of Springs.</p>

<p>"You might swim, stranger," suggested the agent.</p>

<p>Ignoring the sarcasm, the other asked:</p>

<p>"Can't I hire a boat to take me across?"</p>

<p>"No diffikilty if you've got money."</p>

<p>By this time the youths felt that they had had enough of the
scene, and turned to follow the road nearly to the other side
of the island, where it joined the one leading to Hodgdon Island
and then extended across that to the bridge connection with Barter.
They had made so careful a study of the map that they had no fear
of going wrong. They might not have been in such haste, had not
the afternoon been drawing to a close and night certain to be
near when they should reach their destination.</p>

<p>The day was comparatively cool, for be it remembered that while
we are smothering with summer heat in States farther south, there
is little of it on the coast of Maine, except occasionally during
the middle of the day.</p>

<p>Something more than half a mile brought the youths to the first
turn, when they went due north to the skeleton-like bridge which
joins the two islands that have been named. They had walked so
briskly that upon reaching the farther end they paused for a brief
breathing spell. Naturally they looked about them&mdash;across the
comparatively narrow strait to Hodgdon Island, to the right toward
the mainland, and westward in the direction of the Sheepscot River.
Leaning against the railing, they next gazed back over the bridge
which they had just trodden. At the end was a man resting like
themselves and in the same attitude.</p>

<p>"It's odd that he is the first person we have seen since we started,"
remarked Alvin. "Since we didn't meet him he must be going the
same way as ourselves."</p>

<p>"Neither of us is doing much going just now," said Chester. "Have
you thought, Alvin, that we haven't a pistol between us?"</p>

<p>"What of it?"</p>

<p>"We may need it before we are through with this business."</p>

<p>"I remember father telling me that when he was a young man he
visited Texas and at Austin had a long talk with Ben Thomson."</p>

<p>"Who was Ben Thomson?" asked the wondering Chester.</p>

<p>"One of the greatest desperadoes that that State ever produced.
He looked like a dandified young clerk or preacher, but it was
said of him that in all his career he never missed the man at
whom he fired. The governor found him a pleasant fellow to talk
with and they became quite chummy. When asked his advice about
carrying a revolver, Ben told him never to do it&mdash;at least while
in Texas. 'If you do,' said Ben, 'it will be the death of you
as sure as you are now alive. You can't draw half as quick as
the bad men whom you are likely to run against, and the fact that
you are carrying a gun will bring the other's acquittal in any
court where the case may be tried. But if you are unarmed, no
one will molest you, for only the meanest coward will attack an
unarmed man.' Now, what I think is, that we are safer without
a revolver than with one. Neither of us is an expert and we should
have no show with these post office robbers if we got into a fight
where guns were used."</p>

<p>Chester was not satisfied with this view of the situation.</p>

<p>"From what I have heard, such persons don't wait to find out
whether another is armed before firing upon him, and in spite
of what you say, I wish I had a loaded Smith and Wesson, or a
Colt in my hip pocket."</p>

<p>"Well, you haven't nor have I. The governor has no patience with
this fashion among boys of carrying deadly weapons. The temptation
to use them when there is no need is too great."</p>

<p>Chester shook his head in dissent, and as they resumed their
walk discussed the near future, for it was prudent to do so. After
they had crossed the second bridge at the northern end of Hodgdon
Island, he said:</p>

<p>"It can't be much farther to that inlet where we may or may not
find the <em>Deerfoot</em>. It is time we made up our minds what
to do. Suppose we come upon your boat with the thieves in charge,
shall we tell them they have been very naughty and must go away
and let us have the property without making any fuss?"</p>

<p>Alvin laughed.</p>

<p>"Maybe that's as good a plan as any. I believe I can convince
them that the wisest thing for them to do is to turn the boat
over to us and clear out."</p>

<p>"If they are desperate enough to rob post offices and steal a
motor launch, they are not the ones to give it up for the asking.
There!" exclaimed Chester stopping short, "we forgot something."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"We meant to have telegrams sent out to different points from
Boothbay Harbor, asking lots of persons to keep a lookout for
the <em>Deerfoot</em>."</p>

<p>"What's the need of that when we have found her?"</p>

<p>"It isn't certain we have found her, but it can't be helped now."</p>

<p>They resumed their walk, and in due time trod the soil of Barter
Island, by crossing another long wooden bridge. They had met on
the way a rickety wagon, a carriage and one automobile, but no
person on foot. A mile or so farther they came upon a hamlet,
where it seemed prudent to ask a few questions. Night was so near
that it was important that they should make no mistake in their
course. They learned that from this cluster of houses a single
highway led to the western coast of Barter Island. Barely a half
mile beyond the terminus of this road was the inlet upon which
they had centered their hopes. Mr. Richards had told them that
they would have to tramp this distance, but would probably find
a path which would make the task easy. Although minute knowledge
was necessary to enable one to speak definitely, yet Mr. Richards
reminded them that the fact of there being dwellings at varying
distances all along the coast proved that there must be means
of communication between them.</p>

<p>The boys knew they were within a half mile of the inlet when
they paused more to consult than to rest. The road was lined on
both sides by a vigorous growth of fir. To the rear it reached
several hundred yards nearly straight, but curved sharply a little
way off in front. By accident, Chester's face was turned toward
the road behind them. The two had not spoken a dozen words when
Chester remarked without any excitement:</p>

<p>"I wonder who it is that's coming this way; probably some countryman
or fisherman." Alvin looked back.</p>

<p>"I don't see anyone."</p>

<p>"He dodged to one side among the trees when he saw us."</p>

<p>"What made him do that?"</p>

<p>"I wish I knew."</p>
