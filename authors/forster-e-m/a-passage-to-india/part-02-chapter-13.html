<p>These hills look romantic in certain lights and at suitable
distances, and seen of an evening from the upper verandah of the
club they caused Miss Quested to say conversationally to Miss Derek
that she should like to have gone, that Dr. Aziz at Mr. Fielding’s
had said he would arrange something, and that Indians seem rather
forgetful. She was overheard by the servant who offered them
vermouths. This servant understood English. And he was not exactly
a spy, but he kept his ears open, and Mahmoud Ali did not exactly
bribe him, but did encourage him to come and squat with his own
servants, and would happen to stroll their way when he was there.
As the story travelled, it accreted emotion and Aziz learnt with
horror that the ladies were deeply offended with him, and had
expected an invitation daily. He thought his facile remark had been
forgotten. Endowed with two memories, a temporary and a permanent,
he had hitherto relegated the caves to the former. Now he
transferred them once for all, and pushed the matter through. They
were to be a stupendous replica of the tea party. He began by
securing Fielding and old Godbole, and then commissioned Fielding
to approach Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested when they were alone—by
this device Ronny, their official protector, could be circumvented.
Fielding didn’t like the job much; he was busy, caves bored him,
he foresaw friction and expense, but he would not refuse the first
favour his friend had asked from him, and did as required. The
ladies accepted. It was a little inconvenient in the present press
of their engagements, still, they hoped to manage it after
consulting Mr. Heaslop. Consulted, Ronny raised no objection,
provided Fielding undertook full responsibility for their comfort.
He was not enthusiastic about the picnic, but, then, no more were
the ladies—no one was enthusiastic, yet it took place.
</p>
<p>Aziz was terribly worried. It was not a long expedition—a train
left Chandrapore just before dawn, another would bring them back
for tiffin—but he was only a little official still, and feared to
acquit himself dishonourably. He had to ask Major Callendar for
half a day’s leave, and be refused because of his recent malingering;
despair; renewed approach of Major Callendar through Fielding, and
contemptuous snarling permission. He had to borrow cutlery from
Mahmoud Ali without inviting him. Then there was the question of
alcohol; Mr. Fielding, and perhaps the ladies, were drinkers, so
must he provide whisky-sodas and ports? There was the problem of
transport from the wayside station of Marabar to the caves. There
was the problem of Professor Godbole and his food, and of Professor
Godbole and other people’s food—two problems, not one problem. The
Professor was not a very strict Hindu—he would take tea, fruit,
soda-water and sweets, whoever cooked them, and vegetables and rice
if cooked by a Brahman; but not meat, not cakes lest they contained
eggs, and he would not allow anyone else to eat beef: a slice of
beef upon a distant plate would wreck his happiness. Other people
might eat mutton, they might eat ham. But over ham Aziz’ own
religion raised its voice: he did not fancy other people eating
ham. Trouble after trouble encountered him, because he had
challenged the spirit of the Indian earth, which tries to keep men
in compartments.
</p><p>At last the moment arrived.
</p><p>His friends thought him most unwise to mix himself up with English
ladies, and warned him to take every precaution against
unpunctuality. Consequently he spent the previous night at the
station. The servants were huddled on the platform, enjoined not
to stray. He himself walked up and down with old Mohammed Latif,
who was to act as major-domo. He felt insecure and also unreal. A
car drove up, and he hoped Fielding would get out of it, to lend
him solidity. But it contained Mrs. Moore, Miss Quested, and their
Goanese servant. He rushed to meet them, suddenly happy. “But
you’ve come, after all. Oh how very very kind of you!” he cried.
“This is the happiest moment in all my life.”
</p><p>The ladies were civil. It was not the happiest moment in their
lives, still, they looked forward to enjoying themselves as soon
as the bother of the early start was over. They had not seen him
since the expedition was arranged, and they thanked him adequately.
</p><p>“You don’t require tickets—please stop your servant. There are no
tickets on the Marabar branch line; it is its peculiarity. You come
to the carriage and rest till Mr. Fielding joins us. Did you know
you are to travel purdah? Will you like that?”
</p><p>They replied that they should like it. The train had come in, and
a crowd of dependents were swarming over the seats of the carriage
like monkeys. Aziz had borrowed servants from his friends, as well
as bringing his own three, and quarrels over precedence were
resulting. The ladies’ servant stood apart, with a sneering
expression on his face. They had hired him while they were still
globe-trotters, at Bombay. In a hotel or among smart people he was
excellent, but as soon as they consorted with anyone whom he
thought second-rate he left them to their disgrace.
</p><p>The night was still dark, but had acquired the temporary look that
indicates its end. Perched on the roof of a shed, the station-master’s
hens began to dream of kites instead of owls. Lamps were put out,
in order to save the trouble of putting them out later; the smell
of tobacco and the sound of spitting arose from third-class
passengers in dark corners; heads were unshrouded, teeth cleaned
on the twigs of a tree. So convinced was a junior official that
another sun would rise, that he rang a bell with enthusiasm. This
upset the servants. They shrieked that the train was starting, and
ran to both ends of it to intercede. Much had still to enter the
purdah carriage—a box bound with brass, a melon wearing a fez, a
towel containing guavas, a step-ladder and a gun. The guests played
up all right. They had no race-consciousness—Mrs. Moore was too
old, Miss Quested too new—and they behaved to Aziz as to any young
man who had been kind to them in the country. This moved him
deeply. He had expected them to arrive with Mr. Fielding, instead
of which they trusted themselves to be with him a few moments
alone.
</p><p>“Send back your servant,” he suggested. “He is unnecessary. Then
we shall all be Moslems together.”
</p><p>“And he is such a horrible servant. Antony, you can go; we don’t
want you,” said the girl impatiently.
</p><p>“Master told me to come.”
</p><p>“Mistress tells you to go.”
</p><p>“Master says, keep near the ladies all the morning.”
</p><p>“Well, your ladies won’t have you.” She turned to the host. “Do
get rid of him, Dr. Aziz!”
</p><p>“Mohammed Latif!” he called.
</p><p>The poor relative exchanged fezzes with the melon, and peeped out
of the window of the railway carriage, whose confusion he was
superintending.
</p><p>“Here is my cousin, Mr. Mohammed Latif. Oh no, don’t shake hands.
He is an Indian of the old-fashioned sort, he prefers to salaam.
There, I told you so. Mohammed Latif, how beautifully you salaam.
See, he hasn’t understood; he knows no English.”
</p><p>“You spick lie,” said the old man gently.
</p><p>“I spick a lie! Oh, jolly good. Isn’t he a funny old man? We will
have great jokes with him later. He does all sorts of little
things. He is not nearly as stupid as you think, and awfully poor.
It’s lucky ours is a large family.” He flung an arm round the
grubby neck. “But you get inside, make yourselves at home; yes,
you lie down.” The celebrated Oriental confusion appeared at last
to be at an end. “Excuse me, now I must meet our other two guests!”
</p><p>He was getting nervous again, for it was ten minutes to the time.
Still, Fielding was an Englishman, and they never do miss trains,
and Godbole was a Hindu and did not count, and, soothed by this
logic, he grew calmer as the hour of departure approached. Mohammed
Latif had bribed Antony not to come. They walked up and down the
platform, talking usefully. They agreed that they had overdone the
servants, and must leave two or three behind at Marabar station.
And Aziz explained that he might be playing one or two practical
jokes at the caves—not out of unkindness, but to make the guests
laugh. The old man assented with slight sideway motions of the
head: he was always willing to be ridiculed, and he bade Aziz not
spare him. Elated by his importance, he began an indecent anecdote.
</p><p>“Tell me another time, brother, when I have more leisure, for now,
as I have already explained, we have to give pleasure to non-Moslems.
Three will be Europeans, one a Hindu, which must not be forgotten.
Every attention must be paid to Professor Godbole, lest he feel
that he is inferior to my other guests.”
</p><p>“I will discuss philosophy with him.”
</p><p>“That will be kind of you; but the servants are even more important.
We must not convey an impression of disorganization. It can be
done, and I expect you to do it . . .”
</p><p>A shriek from the purdah carriage. The train had started.
</p><p>“Merciful God!” cried Mohammed Latif. He flung himself at the
train, and leapt on to the footboard of a carriage. Aziz did
likewise. It was an easy feat, for a branch-line train is slow to
assume special airs. “We’re monkeys, don’t worry,” he called,
hanging on to a bar and laughing. Then he howled, “Mr. Fielding!
Mr. Fielding!”
</p><p>There were Fielding and old Godbole, held up at the level-crossing.
Appalling catastrophe! The gates had been closed earlier than
usual. They leapt from their tonga; they gesticulated, but what
was the good. So near and yet so far! As the train joggled past
over the points, there was time for agonized words.
</p><p>“Bad, bad, you have destroyed me.”
</p><p>“Godbole’s pujah did it,” cried the Englishman.
</p><p>The Brahman lowered his eyes, ashamed of religion. For it was so:
he had miscalculated the length of a prayer.
</p><p>“Jump on, I must have you,” screamed Aziz, beside himself.
</p><p>“Right, give a hand.”
</p><p>“He’s not to, he’ll kill himself,” Mrs. Moore protested. He jumped,
he failed, missed his friend’s hand, and fell back on to the line.
The train rumbled past. He scrambled on to his feet, and bawled
after them, “I’m all right, you’re all right, don’t worry,” and
then they passed beyond range of his voice.
</p><p>“Mrs. Moore, Miss Quested, our expedition is a ruin.” He swung
himself along the footboard, almost in tears.
</p><p>“Get in, get in; you’ll kill yourself as well as Mr. Fielding. I
see no ruin.”
</p><p>“How is that? Oh, explain to me!” he said piteously, like a child.
</p><p>“We shall be all Moslems together now, as you promised.”
</p><p>She was perfect as always, his dear Mrs. Moore. All the love for
her he had felt at the mosque welled up again, the fresher for
forgetfulness. There was nothing he would not do for her. He would
die to make her happy.
</p><p>“Get in, Dr. Aziz, you make us giddy,” the other lady called. “If
they’re so foolish as to miss the train, that’s their loss, not
ours.”
</p><p>“I am to blame. I am the host.”
</p><p>“Nonsense, go to your carriage. We’re going to have a delightful
time without them.”
</p><p>Not perfect like Mrs. Moore, but very sincere and kind. Wonderful
ladies, both of them, and for one precious morning his guests. He
felt important and competent. Fielding was a loss personally, being
a friend, increasingly dear, yet if Fielding had come, he himself
would have remained in leading-strings. “Indians are incapable of
responsibility,” said the officials, and Hamidullah sometimes said
so too. He would show those pessimists that they were wrong.
Smiling proudly, he glanced outward at the country, which was still
invisible except as a dark movement in the darkness; then upwards
at the sky, where the stars of the sprawling Scorpion had begun to
pale. Then he dived through a window into a second-class carriage.
</p><p>“Mohammed Latif, by the way, what is in these caves, brother? Why
are we all going to see them?”
</p><p>Such a question was beyond the poor relative’s scope. He could only
reply that God and the local villagers knew, and that the latter
would gladly act as guides.
