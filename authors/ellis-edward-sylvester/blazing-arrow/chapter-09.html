<p>It is singular how, in the most critical moments, certain thoughts
will obtrude themselves. While Wharton Edwards was peering over
the ravine and wondering whither Blazing Arrow had vanished, a
sudden suspicion caused him to raise his rifle and examine its
lock.</p>

<p>There was not a grain of powder in the pan and no charge in the
barrel. All the time that it had been in the hands of the Shawanoe
and himself it was as useless as a stick. It seemed incredible
that such should have been the fact, and yet here was the evidence
before his own eyes.</p>

<p>What was equally apparent and more astonishing was that Blazing
Arrow must have been unsuspicious of the truth. The youth had
not reloaded the weapon after firing the last time, and it was,
therefore, empty when he flung it across the ravine preparatory
to making his leap. It had been picked up by the runner, who failed,
in the excitement, to notice the oversight, taking it for granted
that it was ready for use. In the rush of the pursuit he had no
chance of examining it, and when he recovered his senses the gun
was in the hands of its owner.</p>

<p>But had the Shawanoe known the truth, when the lad stood within
a few paces defying him, his pretended weakness would have gone
in a flash, and, bounding to his feet, he would have leaped upon
his conqueror like a panther.</p>

<p>"That's the strangest thing I ever knew," exclaimed Wharton,
with a shudder at his inexplicable escape; "I can't understand
how he and I missed seeing it."</p>

<p>When it is remembered that the fact of an old-fashioned flintlock
being unloaded is perceptible at a glance, the feature of the
mistake is the more remarkable.</p>

<p>The discovery threw the youth into something of a panic. He felt
as if the venomous old man was about to assail him from among
the trees, and, with a quick glance around, made desperate haste
to reload the gun. Not until the ball was rammed down the barrel
and the powder was in the pan did he breathe freely.</p>

<p>"There!" he exclaimed, drawing a sigh of relief, "when I make
that blunder again I deserve to be shot, but the laugh is on Blazing
Arrow more than on me."</p>

<p>Now that he had a trusty weapon in his possession, and the Shawanoe
had none, the situation of the latter was like that of a wild
beast and a marksman. Could the beast leap unawares upon the marksman
he could overcome him, but the latter had only to maintain his
watchfulness.</p>

<p>Had Blazing Arrow rushed toward the lad after he had found his
gun was empty, and before he reloaded it, Wharton's only resource
would have been to take again to his heels; for, active and athletic
as he was, he could not possibly be a match for the powerful,
full-grown warrior, and it would have been foolhardy on his part
to take any such risk.</p>

<p>The disappearance of the Shawanoe during the brief absence of
Wharton was proof that the wily wretch was shamming. His fall
had given him a severe shock, but no bones were broken; and had
the youth heeded the request to help him to rise he would have
snatched him off his feet in a twinkling and had him at his mercy.</p>

<p>Whither had he gone? The dread that he might be stealing among
the trees in the effort to surprise him caused young Edwards to
make a hasty withdrawal from the wood to the open plain which
had been the scene of the severest race of his life.</p>

<p>When he stood clear of the trees, and beyond reach of any sudden
surprise, he breathed freely for the first time.</p>

<p>"Now let him come, if he wants to. I can outrun him anyway, but
I don't run any more races," added Wharton, glancing down at his
gun.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe, who was doubtless glaring at him from some point
of concealment, must have relied upon cunning to outwit his victim.</p>

<p>"I wonder what sort of yarn he will tell his people when he goes
back?" mused Wharton. "How will he account for his failure to
capture me, and what explanation will he give for the loss of
my gun? I suppose he will say he concluded to shoot me, and broke
it over my head and flung it away. But if I come out of this trouble
they will learn the truth some day."</p>

<p>Not forgetting to be on his guard against his foe, the lad walked
slowly across the clearing, taking the back trail. He was considering
the best thing to do. But for Larry Murphy, he would have made
all haste in the opposite direction. The block-house was almost
twenty miles away, and this flurry had delayed the couple so long
that there was no time to spare. Wharton's parents would become
anxious and set out to meet the boys. If they should become involved
with these Indians, direful consequences were likely to follow.</p>

<p>But Wharton could not desert his comrade. He was a mile or two
away, near the main party of warriors, and Providence alone could
prevent his falling into their hands. Larry would naturally suppose
that his friend was not far from him, and it would be just like
the fellow to run into the worst sort of peril in the hope of
doing him service.</p>

<p>"I must get back to him as soon as I can. If he could only know
how fortunate I have been it would be easy for him to steal around
the whole party and join me here. Then we could do some fast travelling,
and be at the block-house before sunrise to-morrow."</p>

<p>Since, however, such a state of affairs was out of the question,
Wharton had only to face matters as they were.</p>

<p>One ground for hope cheered him. The sultry summer afternoon
was drawing to a close, and night was at hand. He could manoeuvre
in the darkness much better than when the sun was shining. He
and the Irish lad had a system of calls and signals by which they
communicated when within hearing distance of each other. He could
fall back on this when darkness fell.</p>

<p>With his controlling wish there was but one thing for him to
do; that was to make his way with the utmost care to the region
of the falls, where he had parted from Larry. If his comrade had
been wise enough to keep out of the hands of the Shawanoes he
was hopeful of opening communication with him. A few more hours
must decide the question.</p>

<p>He increased his pace. When he reached the wood on the opposite
side of the plain it was twilight. He walked rapidly, as though
in a hurry, but after going far enough to be beyond sight he came
stealthily back and looked toward the point where he had reloaded
his gun. As he did so he caught the outlines of a figure in the
dim light steadily approaching, and he knew it was Blazing Arrow,
the Shawanoe.</p>
