<p>Peace closed the magazine with a reluctant sigh. "That," she
said with decided emphasis on the pronoun, "is a good story. If
all <em>orthers</em> wrote like that, 'twould make int'resting
reading."</p>

<p>"What was it about?" asked Allee, looking up from a gorgeous
splash of water-colors which she was pleased to call a painting.</p>

<p>"About a girl named Angelica Regina, who started an endless chain
of letters to help the Ladies' Aid of her uncle's church c'lect
scraps for silk quilts."</p>

<p>"Did the ladies ask her to?"</p>

<p>"Mercy, no! They didn't have an idea that she'd done such a thing,
and they kept wondering where in the world all those scraps were
coming from. Fin'ly it got so bad that the Post Office man was
real mad and the husbands of the Ladies' Aid got mad, and the
ladies themselves got mad and wouldn't take any more bundles that
came through the mail. 'Twasn't till then that anyone knew 'bout
the endless chain of letters. But at last one lady s'spected Angelica
Regina had done the whole thing, and she made her own up to it."</p>

<p>"What is an endless chain of letters? I can't see how she worked
it."</p>

<p>"Why, don't you 'member the letter Hope got last Christmas asking
her to write five more just like it and send them to friends of
hers?"</p>

<p>"Well, but that's only five letters."</p>

<p>"Yes, 'twould be if it stopped there, but each of those five
people had to write five letters more and give them to <em>their</em>
friends. Five times five is twenty-five, and then those twenty-five
would write five letters. Don't you see how it would keep growing
till there would be hundreds and hundreds of letters written?"</p>

<p>Allee nodded solemnly, and Peace fell into a brown study. Presently
she announced decidedly, "I b'lieve I'll do it. I like the scheme."</p>

<p>"Do what? What scheme?" inquired Allee, somewhat absently, as
she critically surveyed her brilliant splotch of color, and wondered
if she had added enough red to her sunset.</p>

<p>"I'll start an endless chain myself."</p>

<p>"What do <em>you</em> want silk scraps for?" Allee's brush fell
unheeded from her hand, and the blue eyes shot an amazed glance
up at the figure in the wheel-chair.</p>

<p>"I don't want any silk scraps, but I can ask for something else,
can't I?"</p>

<p>"What shall you choose?" Allee was now alive with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Well, &mdash;I don't really know&mdash;just yet," Peace was obliged
to confess. "It wouldn't be right to ask 'em each for a dime,
like Hope's letter did, to <em>endower</em> a hospital bed, 'cause
I haven't got the bed, and anyway I don't need money. Grandpa's
got enough for us all. Now if we'd just known of this plan in
Parker, p'raps we could have paid off our mortgage without any
trouble."</p>

<p>"But then Grandpa wouldn't have found us, and we prob'ly would
still be living in the little brown house on that farm," responded
Allee, with a frown.</p>

<p>"That's so. I hadn't thought of that. Well, it can't be money
that I'll ask for, and I don't want silk scraps. Just now I can't
think of a thing I want real bad which Grandpa can't get for me,&mdash;'nless
it is buttons."</p>

<p>"Buttons!" repeated Allee, wondering if Peace had lost her senses
altogether. "What do you want buttons for? What kind of buttons?
Ain't your clothes got enough buttons on 'em now? Grandma&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh!" Peace cautioned, for in her surprise Allee had unconsciously
raised her voice almost to a yell. "I don't mean that kind of
buttons. I mean fancy ones just for a c'lection."</p>

<p>"But what good will a c'lection of <em>buttons</em> be?" demanded
Allee, more puzzled than before. "What can you use 'em for?"</p>

<p>"What can you use any c'lection for?" sarcastically retorted
Peace, exasperated at the little sister's stupidity. "What does
Henderson Meadows use his c'lection of stamps for? Just to brag
about and see how many more kinds he can get than the other boys."</p>

<p>"But &mdash;I never heard of such a thing as a c'lection of <em>buttons</em>,"
persisted Allee, privately worried for fear Peace was going crazy.
"No one that I know has got one."</p>

<p>"They will have as soon as I get mine started," the other girl
stoutly maintained. "You wait and see."</p>

<p>Allee shook her head doubtfully and slowly reached out her hand
for her gorgeous sunset which strongly resembled a rainbow in
convulsions.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to like the plan," suggested Peace, more than
ever determined to make the venture, just to prove to this skeptical
creature that she knew what she was talking about.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't think&mdash;it will work," replied truthful Allee.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll show you. Miss Edith said when she was a girl it
was a fad one winter to see who could get the biggest and prettiest
string of buttons, and when I was telling Grandma she laughed
and said they had the same thing a-going when she was a girl."</p>

<p>"But I don't see any sense to it," protested the younger sister,
still unconvinced.</p>

<p>"I never saw a c'lection yet that had any <em>sense</em> to it,
when it comes to that," Peace reluctantly admitted. "What <em>sense</em>
is there in saving up a lot of dead bugs like Cherry's been doing
all summer, or a bunch of horrid, nasty, dirty old pipes, like
Len Abbott was so proud of; or even all those <em>queeriosities</em>
that Judge Abbott kept in his library and said was worth so much
money! I ain't a-going to do it for the <em>sense</em> there is
in it, but it'll be awful lonesome for me when you girls go back
to school this fall, 'specially as the doctor says I mustn't have
a teacher of my own yet, and I can't do any real studying all
by myself." Privately, Peace was much pleased with this verdict,
but she thought it unnecessary to say so. "That's why I thought
it would be a good plan to get something like this started which
would help fill up the time while you and Cherry were shut up
in school, and Grandma was too busy to pay attention to me."</p>

<p>Allee's antagonism and skepticism vanished as if by magic. She
had opposed this beautiful plan which would mean so much to her
crippled sister! In deepest contrition she enthusiastically proposed,
"Let's write the letter now and send it off so's your answers
will begin coming in as soon as they can. I guess I didn't 'xactly
see what you meant at first. I think it'll be a nice plan."</p>

<p>"All right," Peace replied, quick to take advantage of favorable
circumstances. "You get the paper and ink. I've used mine all
up out here. And say, s'posing we keep this endless chain plan
a secret among our two selves. You can have half the buttons that
come in; but if Cherry should know, she would prob'ly want a share,
too."</p>

<p>"Maybe 'twould be better," Allee agreed, as she ran away to the
house for writing materials.</p>

<p>Then began the task of composing a letter which should cover
their wants; but so many obstacles presented themselves to the
inexperienced writers, that the afternoon had waned before a satisfactory
epistle had resulted.</p>

<p>"There," sighed Peace at length, "I guess that will do. It is
short enough so's it won't take anyone long to make five copies,
and it's long enough so's no one can be mistaken about what we
mean. I wish I knew whether Hope kept the one she got. Maybe we
could have gone by that and made a better letter of ours. This
one in the magazine didn't help very much 'cause it talks about
the Ladies' Aid, and we couldn't use that, for everybody would
know a Ladies' Aid would want something besides buttons in their
work. Do you think ours will do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's perfectly elegant," the younger child replied, lovingly
fingering the inky page of tipsy letters which she had just finished.
"Now who are you going to send them to?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of that all the while we were writing, and
I've already got a list of more'n five."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's Lorene Meadows for a starter. She lives in Chicago
and is acquainted with slews of kids which we don't know. Then
there's Mrs. Grinnell in Parker, and Hec Abbott and Tessie and
Effie and Jessie and Miss Dunbar and Annette Fisher and Mrs. Bainbridge
and Mrs. Hartman and oh&mdash;all the Parker folks."</p>

<p>"Then s'posing we write more'n five to begin with."</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that. There's no reason why we shouldn't.
Let's make it ten,&mdash;that's all the stamps I've got."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Both girls set to work laboriously scribbling the ten copies
of their chain letter, then sealed and addressed them, and Allee
dropped them into the mail box on the corner just as the dinner
bell pealed out its summons to the dining-room.</p>

<p>School began the next Monday. The following day the first link
in the endless chain was received from Lorene, who enclosed twelve
handsome buttons and asked full particulars about the button collection,
as she desired to start one for herself, and could Peace send
her twelve buttons in exchange for hers? This was an unforeseen
development, but Peace was so delighted with this first dozen
that she set Allee to hunting up stray buttons about the house
with which to satisfy the demands of any other youthful collectors.
On Wednesday two more answers were received, one from Mrs. Grinnell,
containing forty of the oddest looking buttons the girls had ever
seen; and one from a stranger in Chicago, probably a friend of
Lorene's, for she, too, asked for buttons in return.</p>

<p>Peace sighed, divided the contents of the two packages with an
impartial hand, and remarked, "It's lucky Mrs. Grinnell don't
want forty in exchange. We had only thirty-six to begin with,
and Lorene's twelve and this girl's eight leaves us only sixteen,
s'posing we get many more answers asking for some."</p>

<p>Fortunately for her peace of mind, however, only one other letter
made such a request, but a new dilemma arose. Packages began to
arrive with insufficient postage, and the crippled girl's pocket
money vanished with alarming rapidity. The letter carrier always
delivered the daily budget of mail to the little maid under the
trees when the weather permitted of her being at her post, and
it chanced that for a fortnight after the answers to her endless
chain began pouring in, she received her own mail, so no one but
Allee knew her secret, and there was no one but Allee to help
her out with her heavy postage bills.</p>

<p>"I never s'posed anyone would send out packages without enough
stamps on 'em," she complained to her loyal supporter one night,
after an unusually heavy mail and a correspondingly heavy drain
on her pocketbook. "And the trouble is, the letters that have
the most money to pay on them hold the ugliest buttons. I spent
twelve cents for stamps today. That's the worst yet. Yesterday
it was ten, and seven the day before. There won't be much of my
monthly dollar left if it keeps on this way. The postman got sassy
this morning and asked me if I'd started a&mdash;a correspondence school,
or if I was having a birthday shower every day. I'm tired of the
sight of buttons!"</p>

<p>"Already?" cried Allee. "Why, I think they are fine. If your
dollar is all spent before the month is up, you can use mine.
I ought to pay half the stampage anyway, as long as I get half
the buttons. All the girls at school are wild to know where we
get so many, but I won't tell. There's eight hundred on your string
and seven hundred and fifty on mine."</p>

<p>"But I divided 'em even&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know you did, but you see, I traded some, and Dolly Thomas
cried 'cause she had only twenty buttons on her string, so I gave
her a few of mine."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish we had some way to make the chain end," sighed
Peace disconsolately. "I've got as big a c'lection as I want now
and still they keep a-coming. That's just the way those silk scraps
did to the Ladies' Aid in the story. O, dear, don't I get into
the worst messes! I wouldn't mind if they'd pay their own stamps,
but I want my money for Christmas, and if this keeps up I'll have
to break into my bank. I thought it would be such fun to get mail
every day, but the very sight of the postman now makes me sick."</p>

<p>"We might tell Grandpa. He'd know what to do," suggested Allee,
seeing that Peace was really heartily tired of this deluge of
buttons.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I hate to do that. He'd think we were little sillies
and I guess we are."</p>

<p>"'Twas your plan," Allee briefly informed her, for she did not
care to be called a "silly" by anyone.</p>

<p>"Of course it was," Peace hastily acknowledged. "And I'm tired
of it. Maybe&mdash;don't you think Miss Edith could tell us what to
do?"</p>

<p>"I b'lieve she could. Ask her tomorrow. She'll be sure to pass,
even if she doesn't have time to stop awhile. O, see who's coming!"</p>

<p>"Elspeth!" cried Peace, almost bouncing out of her chair in her
eagerness to greet the dear friend whose face she had not seen
for many weeks.</p>

<p>"My little girlies!" The woman's sweet face bent over the eager
one among the pillows and lingered there. It was the first time
she had seen the crippled child since the doctors had pronounced
her case hopeless, and she had feared that her presence might
recall to Peace's mind the great misfortune, and bring on a deluge
of tears. But Peace was thinking of other things than wheel-chairs.
This was the first time she had seen her Elspeth since the Angel
Baby had slipped away to its Maker, and she glanced apprehensively
into the tender blue eyes above her, expecting to find them dim
with tears of grief for the little one she had lost. Instead,
they were smiling serenely. She had locked her sorrow deep down
in her heart, and only God and her good St. John knew what a heavy
ache throbbed in her breast.</p>

<p>So the brown eyes smiled bravely back, and after a moment the
eager voice asked reproachfully, "Didn't you bring the b&mdash;the
children? I haven't seen Baby Elspeth yet, and she is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two months old tomorrow," proudly answered the mother. "Yes,
we brought her. We call her Bessie to avoid confusion of names.
St. John has her now, but he happened to meet our postman on the
street back there and stopped to tell him about some mail that
he doesn't want delivered any longer."</p>

<p>"What kind of mail?" Peace breathlessly demanded, suddenly remembering
her endless chain of letters.</p>

<p>"O, some cheap magazines that keep coming. He wrote the publishers
two or three times to discontinue them, but it didn't do any good,
so now he is telling the postman not to bring them any more."</p>

<p>"Is that all you have to do?" The brown eyes were glowing with
eagerness.</p>

<p>"Yes. Refuse to accept them when the postman brings them and
they will soon stop coming."</p>

<p>"Will it work with packages?"</p>

<p>"With anything, I guess."</p>

<p>"What happens to the things you refuse?"</p>

<p>"O, some of them are returned to the sender, some go to the dead-letter
office, and others are just destroyed, I guess."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Peace had received all the information she needed, and
as St. John now appeared at the gate with Glen in tow and Baby
Bessie in his arms, she turned her attention to her guests, who,
as a special surprise for the invalid, had been invited to stay
for dinner.</p>

<p>The next day, however, when the postman made his appearance with
his arms bulging with packages, and a grin of amusement stretching
his mouth from ear to ear, he was astounded to hear the little
lady in the wheel-chair say crisply, "Take 'em all back. I won't
receive another one you bring me. I s'pose there is postage to
pay on most of 'em, too, ain't there?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen cents," he acknowledged.</p>

<p>"Well, this is the time you don't get your fifteen cents," she
announced calmly but with decision.</p>

<p>"But I can't deliver these packages until that is paid."</p>

<p>"Goody! I'm tired of the sight of them. The very looks of you
coming up the walk gives me a pain. Don't bring me another single
package. Take them back to the&mdash;the letter undertaker&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The what?" His eyes were twinkling, and he had hard work to
keep his twitching lips from breaking into an audible chuckle.</p>

<p>"The place you send mail when it ain't wanted by the person it's
supposed to go to. I've had all I care to do with chain letters.
I really didn't think they were <em>endless</em> or I never would
have started mine. We've got buttons enough to start a department
store already."</p>

<p>The light of understanding broke over the postman's rugged features.
"So it was a chain letter, was it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you don't want any more packages?"</p>

<p>"I won't <em>accept</em> any more." She bobbed her head emphatically
and set all the short curls to dancing.</p>

<p>"All right, Miss Peace. I'll see that you aren't bothered with
any more packages."</p>

<p>Peace heaved a great sigh of relief, and turned energetically
back to her basket weaving, which had been sadly neglected of
late. The parcels actually did cease coming, and the two conspirators
hugged themselves with delight that it had not been necessary
to tell their secret so no one knew what sillies they were. By
common consent they barred chain letters as a topic of conversation,
and had almost forgotten the hateful packages when one morning
Peace received a letter from Miss Truman, still a teacher in the
Parker School, saying that she had just mailed a large box addressed
to the little invalid, and hoped that Peace would enjoy its contents.
The girl was wild with anticipation, but the parcel did not put
in appearance that afternoon, nor the next day, nor the next.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it has gone astray," said Grandpa Campbell when
the third morning passed without it coming.</p>

<p>"And won't I ever get it?" asked Peace disconsolately.</p>

<p>"Such things sometimes happen, though Parker is such a short
distance from here that it seems almost impossible for it to have
been lost. I will call at the Post Office and inquire. Perhaps
for some reason it is stalled there."</p>

<p>That afternoon he appeared with the coveted parcel in his hand
and a mystified look in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You got it?" shrieked Peace in ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Yes, I got it, but if the Postmaster had not been a very good
friend of mine, you would never have seen it."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Peace was genuinely amazed. "What right had the Postmaster
to my package? Did he want to keep it?"</p>

<p>"He tells me that you issued orders two weeks or more ago not
to deliver any more packages to your address."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;oh, that was buttons! I didn't mean this kind of packages."</p>

<p>"Buttons!" the President looked even more puzzled.</p>

<p>"O, dear," sighed Peace unhappily. "Now I've got to tell what
a silly-pate I've been." So she poured out the tale of the endless
chain to the astonished man, ending with the characteristic remark,
"And I told the letter-carrier to send all the rest of the button
packages to the letter graveyard at Washington, but I s'posed
of course he'd bring me packages like this."</p>

<p>"He has no way of distinguishing between them, my dear," the
President gravely informed her, trying hard to keep his face straight.
"You ordered <em>all</em> parcels addressed to you stopped. You
refused to accept them, and there will be no more delivered to
you."</p>

<p>"<em>Never?</em>" gasped Peace.</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;not for months and months and months. I don't know exactly
how we can get the matter fixed up now."</p>

<p>"And will they keep all my <em>Christmas</em> packages, too?"</p>

<p>"If they come addressed to you."</p>

<p>"Where's my pencil and postcards?" She began a wild, scrambling
search, through the drawers of the table which always stood beside
her chair.</p>

<p>"What do you want of them?" the man inquired with considerable
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Why, I've got to write everyone I know and tell 'em if they
want to send me anything for Christmas or my birthday, or any
other time, to address it on the outside to Allee," she retorted,
scribbling away energetically.</p>
