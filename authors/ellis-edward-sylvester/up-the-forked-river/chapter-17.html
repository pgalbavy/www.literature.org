<p>The cheek of the American blanched, and she looked earnestly
at her friend, as if she did not take in the full meaning of her
words. She spoke in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Tell me what you mean."</p>

<p>The other rose from her chair, walked across the room to the
closed door, and turned the big key in the massive lock. Then
she lifted the ponderous bar and dropped it into place.</p>

<p>"It may not be necessary," she said, as she came back, sat down
and took the hand which she had released; "for though some of
the servants may be in the next room, or in the hall outside,
none can hear what we say. It will do no harm, however, to be
certain. If you could have your wish you would be in Zalapata
tonight?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly I should."</p>

<p>"Because the Major is there, but if he chanced to be away, your
situation would be no better than at Atlamalco."</p>

<p>"I am certain it would be a thousand-fold better."</p>

<p>"I am afraid, dear friend from the North, that I see some things
clearer than you; General Bambos is just as much infatuated with
your loveliness as General Yozarro."</p>

<p>"But he has a wife and family!" was the horrified exclamation
of Miss Starland.</p>

<p>"That makes not the slightest difference to him."</p>

<p>An expression of unutterable scorn darkened the face of the American.</p>

<p>"Impossible as it seems, Manuela, I must believe you. How can
you live here?" she asked with impulsive disgust; "you cannot
trust <em>any</em> man in this country."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Warrenia, they are not all alike; I certainly know
<em>one</em> who is different from the two we have been talking
about."</p>

<p>And the dark countenance became delightfully darker, and was
aglow with the radiance of perfect love and trust.</p>

<p>"I am glad to assure you I believe every word you say; I forgot
Captain Ramon Ortega, the brave officer and faultless gentleman,
whose greatest good fortune is to come when he wins you."</p>

<p>"And his good fortune will be no greater than mine; but, Warrenia,
to leave the most winsome of subjects for the most hateful, you
will be safer at Zalapata with Major Jack, but neither of you
will be secure until you are on the yacht and beyond reach of
General Bambos, as well as of General Yozarro. I could almost
advise you to wait here, and yet something whispers it will not
do."</p>

<p>"But how am I to leave? It will not do to attempt the journey
alone to Zalapata, and what way is there of sending word thither?"</p>

<p>"Why shall we not have our ponies brought up and ride direct
to the capital? They are here already, with proper saddles. We
can start tomorrow after breaking fast, and we should reach the
capital by nightfall."</p>

<p>"Do you know the route?"</p>

<p>"As well as the walks around the old Seminary, where we spent
the happiest days of our lives; I have gone over it many times
in my girlhood and have done so since coming home."</p>

<p>"Neither of us carries any firearms and we must face danger."</p>

<p>"I was never in any danger, though I suppose there must be more
or less of it. I shouldn't like to meet a jaguar, tiger cat or
zaratu, but we might do so without any harm coming to us."</p>

<p>"What of the serpents?"</p>

<p>"The big ones are near the streams and in the marshy country;
we have a few coral snakes with their black heads and ringed bodies,
but we are as safe from them without as with firearms. This part
of the world is not so much infested as others. If I have no hesitation
in making the venture should you feel any?"</p>

<p>"I do not; shall we take an escort?"</p>

<p>"It would seem we ought to do so, but I believe it best to have
none."</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>"They would be soldiers of General Yozarro."</p>

<p>The significance of these words was not lost upon the other,
who hastened to say:</p>

<p>"Let us go alone."</p>

<p>They sat communing until the night was far advanced. Their plans
for the morrow may be summarized in what has been stated. Both
believed that no special risk would be run in venturing upon a
journey of something more than twenty miles by daylight, without
firearms or escort. As a rule, strangers had little to fear in
passing through any section of either republic, and there were
several native huts along the trail, where the Señorita had obtained
refreshment and secured lodging on some of the journeys that were
begun too late in the day to be completed before nightfall. Although
she was always in the company of others, it was not on account
of any misgiving or fear on her part.</p>

<p>Very rarely or never was a wheeled vehicle seen either in Zalapata
or Atlamalco, and the connecting roads were naturally no more
than simple trails; but all of these were so clearly marked that
there was no cause for even a stranger losing his way. While the
bifurcation of the river made the water communication between
the republics more convenient, many preferred the overland journey.
The ride through the craggy mountains, whose width may be roughly
given as less than half a dozen miles, was romantic and easy enough
when made on the back of a horse.</p>

<p>The strange, disturbing situation in which Miss Starland found
herself kept her awake long after the gentle breathing of her
friend at her side told her she was unconscious. The conditions
were so singular and so alarming that at times she was mystified
and doubted the wisdom of the course they had decided upon. She
could not believe that the path was as free from danger as the
Señorita supposed. None the less, she was resolved to make the
venture. There was one comforting feature about it all: if they
were followed and brought back under some pretext by the soldiers
of General Yozarro, no unpleasant consequences would result therefrom
to them. The man would be ready with some plausible justification
of his course, but would be as effusive in his courtesy as ever.
Finally the sorely troubled one slept.</p>

<p>Neither awoke until the sunlight streamed through the narrow
windows, and then the two were roused by the knocking on the outer
door, and the call of Juanita that she was waiting with their
food. She was admitted and the meal on the broad silver tray was
set on the stand in the middle of the apartment. Nothing could
have been more appetizing, in that smothering climate, consisting
as it did wholly of fruit, and delicious cocoa, including prepared
rice, mandioc and cassava, the last being the most popular food
in that part of the world.</p>

<p>Juanita having left the meal, courtesied, called down the blessings
of the saints upon the visitors, and, assuring them that it would
be her happiness to come whenever wanted and to act the part of
slave all her life to them, went away, and once more our friends
were alone. The Señorita did not fasten the door, for there was
no call to do so, and in due time, the two drew up their chairs
and partook of the food with the zest of youth and health. There
was abundance for both and they fully enjoyed it. By and by, Juanita
returned and removed the remains of the repast.</p>

<p>Miss Starland walked to each of the narrow windows in turn and
gazed out over the surrounding country. One of the openings gave
a view of the Rio Rubio, as it wound to the eastward, until its
reunion and onward flow to the Atlantic. She descried a catboat
leaning far over and skimming up stream toward Atlamalco, and
a canoe, in which were two natives, was observed, as one of the
occupants swung his paddle like an American Indian and drove the
tiny craft toward the northern shore. But as her vision roved
up and down the river, she failed to see that for which she longed
above everything else. The yacht which had brought her to this
part of the world was still absent. In neither direction could
she catch a glimpse of Atlamalco or Zalapata. The other window
opened to the south, or toward the mountains, where the view had
no interest for her.</p>

<p>As she had done before, she remarked upon the massiveness of
the walls and the straightness of the window openings.</p>

<p>"They are so narrow that we could not force ourselves through."</p>

<p>"Our old buccaneer friend must have had them made thus on purpose.
Suppose some of those who hated him&mdash;which means all the others&mdash;should
have become strong enough to clamber up the walls on the outside,&mdash;was
it not well to make it impossible for them to enter the Castle?"</p>

<p>The matter, however, was of slight interest to our friends and
they hurried their preparations for the journey. The Señorita
donned her hat and led the way down the steps to the outside.
To both it looked as if the number of guards had been increased
during the night, for more than a dozen were in sight, without
regarding those who had lain down to rest. The young women were
saluted by all as they appeared, and the soldiers whom they recognized
as their escort of the night before, came forward to learn their
wishes.</p>

<p>"Carlos, the ponies that brought us here are still with you?"</p>

<p>"They are, Señorita."</p>

<p>"Have them saddled and brought out; we are to ride to Zalapata
today, and wish to make an early start."</p>

<p>The man removed his hat, bowed and spoke with the utmost respect:</p>

<p>"I am grieved not to hasten to comply with your commands; but
we have orders from General Yozarro that the Señoritas are to
remain here till he comes, which will be in a few hours, I think.
It fills my heart with sorrow, but as a soldier, the Señorita
knows that no choice is left to me."</p>

<p>And this time, he made two obesiances,&mdash;one for each of the dumfounded
young women.</p>
