<p>Although Mike Murphy rarely got the worst of it in a bout at
repartee, he had the true sporting instinct and liked the winner
because of his victory. It took a bright person to beat him, but
it did happen now and then, and he enjoyed a clash of wits with
one who proved his master, though in the long run the youth generally
came out ahead.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the girl in the post office at Beartown snapped
out the remark just printed, he was roused to admiration. He threw
back his head and the store rang with his infectious laughter.</p>

<p>"Begorra! ye were too much for me that time. If ye'll not think
me impudent, I beg the privilege of shaking hands wid ye."</p>

<p>The merry sprite, laughing almost as heartily as he, though with
less noise, reached a dainty hand across the counter and he grasped
it. From behind the rack at the front of the store, the gentle
mother beamed with a smile. She had heard and understood it all.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Nora, you were rude to the gentleman," she said
in her silvery voice.</p>

<p>"Not a bit!" was the hearty response of Mike. "I got it that
time where the chicken got the axe&mdash;which the same is in the neck.
It was a fair hit and I desarved more, though no one could give
it to me."</p>

<p>It may be said that this little incident fixed Mike in the favor
of mother and daughter. It was hard to resist the rollicking good
nature of the Irish youth, who was equally impressed by the gentle
goodness of the mother and the sprightly wit of the daughter.
He now called a halt with his nonsense and gave a true account
of the situation. His two companions were the sons of wealthy
parents and one of them owned a beautiful motor launch which broke
down while descending the river from Wiscasset. He had left the
two trying to tinker it in shape, but had doubts of their success.
In case they failed, it would be very pleasing to them if they
could get supper and lodging in Beartown. Would the good woman
advise them where to apply?</p>

<p>She replied that she would be glad to meet their wants, though
they would be disappointed with the poor meals and lodging, for
she knew they must be accustomed to much better. This was the
invitation for which Mike was angling and he promptly accepted,
assuring the woman that it was a fine piece of good fortune which
more than repaid them for the disabling of their engine.</p>

<p>"They may repair it and go home," suggested Nora.</p>

<p>"That will make no difference, for I sha'n't return to them till
night comes and then they'll have no ch'ice."</p>

<p>"They may not wait for you," said Nora.</p>

<p>"Little fear of their laving widout me, so nothing will be done
till I arrive, as Brian O'Lynn said when he was walking forth
to be hanged."</p>

<p>With no other purpose in mind than to force his friends to stay
over night in the village, Mike Murphy loitered. When the mother
and daughter were not engaged with customers he entertained them
by his quaint remarks, which kept the smile on their faces. He
had seated himself, on the invitation of Nora, in a chair at the
rear of the store, where he was in no one's way and where he could
make use of his eyes. Thus it came about that he observed several
interesting facts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Friestone and Nora made up the whole force of the store,
which did a considerable trade in groceries and articles such
as a village community needs. Furthermore, the abundant and excellent
stock showed that the owner was not only enterprising but understood
her business. The other store in Beartown hardly rose to the dignity
of a rival.</p>

<p>It may as well be said at this point that her husband, who had
been dead six years, went through the whole war for the Union
and was badly wounded several times. President Grant personally
complimented Captain Friestone for his bravery in battle, and
when he became President appointed him as postmaster at Beartown.
He suffered so grievously from his old wounds that the small post
office and his pension were all that saved him and his young wife
from actual want. He took up storekeeping in a small way, gradually
branching out until he had established a flourishing business,
whereupon he did an almost unheard of thing. As soon as he knew
his future was secure, he notified the government that he would
no longer accept a pension and he stuck to the resolution.</p>

<p>The veteran was retained in office by the successors of President
Grant until his death, when the appointment was given to his widow,
not a member of the community asking for a change. The income
was meagre, but the widow had become accustomed to the duties,
having performed them during the last years of her husband's life,
and she liked the work. The store paid so well that it more than
met the wants of the two.</p>

<p>When the cheering thousands welcomed the soldiers returning from
the war, a proud father held his little girl on his shoulder and
she waved her hand joyously to the bronzed heroes some of whom
were still little more than boys. One laughing soldier snatched
away the child and kissed her. He was Captain Friestone and the
girl was Bessie Elton. The acquaintance thus begun ripened until
the time arrived for her to put on long dresses, and by and by
she became the happy bride of the officer, and never a shadow
darkened their hearthstone until Death called and took away the
brave husband and father.</p>

<p>Mike noticed that a massive safe stood behind the counter in
a corner at the rear of the store. The ponderous door was open,
for mother and daughter had frequent cause to use the repository.
Within the steel structure all the stamps, government funds and
daily cash receipts were deposited at the close of the day's business.
The value of these was slight, but the safe contained a great
deal more. While Nora was lighting the five kerosene lamps, suspended
on brackets at favorable points in the store, a middle aged and
somewhat corpulent man bustled in, nodded to the widow and handed
her a large sealed envelope. Mike heard him say, "Twenty-five
hundred," and she replied "Very well." It was evident that he
had brought in that amount of money and left if for security with
her. On the back of the envelope&mdash;though of course the youth did
not see this&mdash;was written in a large, round hand, "C. Jasper,
$2500."</p>

<p>The widow walked to the rear of the store, drew out one of the
small central drawers of the safe and placed the big envelope
in it, still leaving the heavy door open, though the little drawer
was locked with a tiny key.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, a second man, thin, nervous and alert, stepped
through the door, glanced sharply around and passed a similar
envelope to the woman. On the back of it was written, "G. H. Kupfer&mdash;$1250."</p>

<p>"You will please give me a receipt," he said in his brisk fashion.
The reply was gentle:</p>

<p>"I cannot do that."</p>

<p>"Why not? It's simple business."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kupfer, because you have more faith in my safe than in your
small one, you bring your money to me. I have not asked it; I
should rather not have it, and I do it only to accommodate you,
besides which I charge you nothing. If burglars should break in
and steal your money, I cannot be responsible. Do I make that
clear to you?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Friestone, I have no fear of that sort; I only ask
that you give me a receipt merely as a matter of record and to
save you possible annoyance. Suppose anything should happen to
me&mdash;such as my death&mdash;my folks would be put to great trouble to
get this money."</p>

<p>"That cannot possibly occur, for your name and the amount are
written on the sealed envelope; I know every member of your family,
and in the event you speak of I should hand it personally to some
one of them. On no other condition will I take your money for
safe keeping. Follow your own pleasure."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," replied the caller, with a nervous laugh, "have it
as you please. I have left money with you before and haven't suffered.
But say&#11834;"</p>

<p>As the keen eyes flitted around the store, he saw Mike Murphy
sitting under one of the lamps and looking as if he was not listening
to their conversation. Mr. Kupfer leaned over the counter and
lowered his voice:</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"A young gentleman."</p>

<p>"I don't like his looks."</p>

<p>"Then I advise you not to look at him," was the reply.</p>

<p>"How long is he going to hang round the store?"</p>

<p>"Just so long as it suits his pleasure to do so. He and two of
his friends are going to take supper and stay overnight with us."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about the two?"</p>

<p>"I have never seen them, and I never saw this young gentleman
till this afternoon."</p>

<p>The caller turned his face and scanned Mike more closely. The
youth, who was boiling with anger, tried to look as if unaware
of the insulting action.</p>

<p>"Please hand that package back," said Mr. Kupfer, with a compression
of his thin lips.</p>

<p>Without a word, the widow passed the envelope to the man, who
whisked through the open door, fairly leaping off the porch to
the dusty path.</p>

<p>Who shall describe the emotions of Mike Murphy during these exasperating
moments? He recalled the experience of Alvin and Chester, as they
related it to him, when they were arrested as post office robbers
some days before, and now something similar in essence had come
to him. But what could he do? He would have liked to pummel the
one who had insulted him, but that was impracticable, inasmuch
as he had not addressed any words to the youth.</p>

<p>While he was fuming and glaring at the door through which the
man had disappeared, Mike heard a soft chuckle behind him. He
whisked his head around and saw Nora standing beside the safe
just back of him, stuffing her handkerchief in her mouth and with
her face almost as crimson as his own.</p>

<p>"If I may be so bowld I should like to know what ye are laughing
at," said Mike, who could feel no resentment toward the merry
young miss.</p>

<p>"We both heard what he said," she replied as soon as she could
command her voice.</p>

<p>"Being I faal like a firecracker that has jest been teched off,
I suspict I caught his loving remarks consarning mesilf."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me something truly&mdash;upon your word of honor&mdash;take
your dying oath?"</p>

<p>"That I will, ye may depind upon the same."</p>

<p>"Are you a real post office robber?"</p>
