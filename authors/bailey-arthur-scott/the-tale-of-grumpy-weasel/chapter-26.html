<p>Grumpy Weasel wondered how Peter Mink was going to get Mr. Snowy Owl out
of Pleasant Valley. He had never dreamed that Peter could do it. But as
he thought the matter over he remembered that Peter was a good deal
bigger than himself.
</p>
<p>"If I were Peter Mink's size I would give Mr. Snowy Owl the worst
punishing he ever had!" Grumpy exclaimed under his breath. "So maybe
Peter can do as he claims, after all."
</p><p>"Very well!" Grumpy Weasel told Peter Mink. "This is a bargain. I'll
help you out of the trap. And you'll rid Pleasant Valley of Mr. Snowy
Owl by April Fool's Day."
</p><p>"Agreed!" Peter Mink cried. "And now, how are you going to set me free?"
</p><p>"I'm going to bite your leg off," Grumpy Weasel said cheerfully.
</p><p>"Oh, no! You're not going to do that!" Peter Mink howled. "I don't want
you to do that!"
</p><p>"I made a bargain with you," Grumpy Weasel reminded him, "and I intend
to carry out my part of it."
</p><p>"Stop a moment," Peter Mink cried. For Grumpy Weasel, with his back
arched like a cat's, and his white whiskers twitching, had already taken
a step towards him. "If you bite off my leg I'd never be able to get rid
of Mr. Snowy Owl."
</p><p>That brought Grumpy Weasel up short. He thought deeply for a moment;
and then he exclaimed: "I have it! You must bite off your own leg!"
</p><p>But Peter Mink proved a hard one to please.
</p><p>"You don't understand!" he said. "If I lose a leg I know I never could
get Mr. Snowy Owl out of the valley."
</p><p>At that Grumpy Weasel lost his temper completely. With a cry of rage he
sprang at his cousin, Peter Mink, prisoner though he was. And Grumpy
would have buried his white teeth in him except for just one thing. As
he leaped forward Peter Mink leaped backward. And in that moment Peter
freed himself. He had been caught only by the merest tip of a toe,
anyhow. And now he crouched with his back against the bank of the brook,
facing Grumpy Weasel with mouth wide open. His meekness had dropped off
him like an old coat. And Grumpy Weasel knew better than to get within
his reach. In fact he turned polite himself, all at once.
</p><p>"There!" he said. "I got you out of the trap, as I had planned to all
the time. I knew that if I could make you jump you'd pull your foot
loose."
</p><p>Well, Peter Mink hardly believed that. But he thought there was no use
of saying so.
</p><p>He was glad enough to escape Farmer Green's hired man's trap without
having a dispute over the way it happened.
</p><p>"I hope you'll keep your promise," Grumpy told Peter Mink. "If Mr. Snowy
Owl doesn't leave these parts by April Fool's Day I won't like it very
well. You know you agreed to get him away from here by that time."
</p><p>"Oh! He'll be gone by then," said Peter Mink lightly. "He always leaves
at the end of the winter, because he spends his summers in the Far
North."
</p><p>When he heard that, Grumpy Weasel was angry as anything.
</p><p>"Then Mr. Owl is likely to be back here next fall," he said quickly.
</p><p>"I dare say," Peter Mink admitted carelessly.
</p><p>Grumpy Weasel backed cautiously away before he said another word. But
when he had whisked into a great willow that leaned over Broad Brook he
told his cousin what he thought about him.
</p><p>As for Peter Mink--he was nursing his injured paw (in his mouth!) and he
said never a word.
