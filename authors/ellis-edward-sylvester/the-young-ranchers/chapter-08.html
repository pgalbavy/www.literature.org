<p>Warren Starr was terrified for the moment by the peril of his
companion. While running toward him he saw the grizzly rise partly
on his haunches to seize Tim, who was within his grasp, but at
that instant the brute toppled over, and with one or two struggles
was dead.</p>

<p>It was an exciting moment, but a singular discovery came to young
Starr&mdash;the shot that slew the bear was fired neither by himself
nor Tim!</p>

<p>Without waiting to investigate, he dashed to where his panting
friend was looking down at the fallen monster, as if uncertain
what to do.</p>

<p>"Gracious, Tim!" called Warren, as he came up, "that was the
closest call you ever had."</p>

<p>"It's qu'ar," replied the other, "that after we had pumped about
a ton of lead into him without hurting the spalpeen, he should
dhrop down from a single shot."</p>

<p>"That's because it was aimed right."</p>

<p>"But ye had no bitter chance than meself, nor what ye also was
given a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>"But it was not I, Tim, who fired the last shot."</p>

<p>"What are ye talking about?" demanded the other. "I had no chance
to shoot me rifle, and who ilse could have done the same?"</p>

<p>"But I tell you I did not fire; I was about to do so, when someone
else saved me the trouble; I am sure I couldn't have done any
better than I did before."</p>

<p>"Thin who was the mon?"</p>

<p>The question naturally caused the couple to look around in quest
of the unknown friend.</p>

<p>They saw him at the first glance.</p>

<p>"There he is! Look at him!" whispered Tim Brophy.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred yards away stood an Indian warrior, calmly
watching them. He had mounted a bowlder, so that his figure was
brought out in clear relief. He was in Indian costume, most of
it being hidden by a heavy blanket gathered around the shoulders,
but the leggings and moccasons showed beneath, and the head was
ornamented with stained eagle-feathers. The noticeable fact about
him, however, was that his black hair was short, and the feathers
were fixed in a sort of band, which clasped the forehead. The
rather pleasing face was fantastically daubed with paint, and
he held a fine rifle in his right hand, the other being concealed
under his blanket.</p>

<p>His action, or rather want of action, was striking. The bowlder
which supported him was no more stationary than he. He gazed fixedly
at the youths, but made no signs and uttered no word.</p>

<p>"Begorra, but he's a shtrange gintleman," muttered Tim. "I wonder
if he's posin' for his picter."</p>

<p>"His firing of the gun proves that he is a friend," said Warren;
"so we have nothing to fear from him."</p>

<p>"If that's the case why doesn't he come forward and interdooce
himself? whisht now!"</p>

<p>What did the Irishman do but pucker up his mouth, whistle, and
beckon to the Indian to approach. The latter, however, did not
move a muscle.</p>

<p>"Helloa!" called Warren; "we thank you for your kindness; won't
you come forward and join us?"</p>

<p>This appeal was as fruitless as the other.</p>

<p>"If the copper gintleman won't come to us I'm going to him."</p>

<p>It was just like Tim to start forward to carry out his intention,
though a sense of delicacy restrained his companion from joining
him. The Indian, however, nipped the little scheme in the bud.</p>

<p>The Irishman had taken only two or three steps, when the Sioux,
as he evidently was, turned about, leaped lightly down from the
bowlder, and vanished.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged!" exclaimed the disappointed Tim, stopping
short; "ye may be a good rifle shot, but be the same token ye
are not fond of selict company," and with a laugh he walked back
to his friend, whose face was so grave as to attract the notice
of the Irishman.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Warren?"</p>

<p>"Do you know who that Indian is?"</p>

<p>"I niver have saan him before."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have, many a time; he's been at our house within the
past few weeks."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Starcus."</p>

<p>"Git out!"</p>

<p>"I'm not mistaken," insisted young Starr, compressing his lips
and shaking his head. "He's painted and dressed like his people,
but his short hair made me suspicious, and when he turned to jump
down from the bowlder, he made a movement that fixed his identity
beyond all doubt."</p>

<p>"Wal, ye're so sartin about it that I can't help belaving ye;
but if it was Starcus, why did he act that way? Why didn't he
spake, and why didn't he coom forward and shake hands wid us?"</p>

<p>"That's what troubles me; it wasn't like him. It makes me believe
he has joined the hostiles."</p>

<p>"But if that is the case why did he interfere whin the grizzly
was about to chaw me up?"</p>

<p>"His whole action was strange, but I explain it this way: He
was prowling through this place, probably to help the bucks that
are now on the warpath, when he heard our guns, made his way forward,
and seeing the bear about to pounce upon you, he fired with the
wish to save you. Your danger caused him to feel friendly toward
us; for otherwise, instead of killing the bear he would have shot
you and me."</p>

<p>"Maybe he fired at me instead of the bear," suggested Tim, "and
it was a chance shot that saved meself."</p>

<p>"That cannot be, for he is too good a marksman to make such a
miss. I have fired at a target with him and never saw a better
shot than he. Then, too, when he found he missed, he could have
turned his Winchester on us in turn and brought us both down."</p>

<p>"And ye think after his doing us that kindness, he became an
inimy agin?"</p>

<p>"He has caught the craze that is setting his people wild, and
though you didn't recognize him yesterday among that party of
bucks near the house, I believe he was either there or was one
of the horsemen that stampeded the cattle. He is with them body
and soul. His last shot was given through impulse. Of course he
knew us both, and acted from a generous motive. He may have stood
there debating with himself whether to continue that friendship,
when your advance scattered all his good resolutions to the winds.
He has gone off to join the others, and when we meet again he
will be our bitter foe, eager to serve us both as he served the
grizzly. Let us not deceive ourselves about that."</p>

<p>"There's one thing that looks well," remarked Tim a moment later;
"if Starcus is wid the ither spalpeens, they haven't found your
fayther and mither, for they're not in this part of the counthry."</p>

<p>"That gives me relief," said Warren, with a glowing face; "the
folks must be many miles away, and these people are off their
track altogether. Father will waste no time, but push on. This
snow is not deep enough to bother them, and they ought to be safely
within Fort Meade by nightfall."</p>

<p>"But what about us?" asked Tim significantly.</p>

<p>"This isn't our right latitude. We must pull out as quickly as
we can. Our ponies are fresh, and can travel as fast as any of
the Indian ones. We haven't far to go to reach the open country,
and then we'll head for the fort, unless we conclude to hunt for
the folks before reaching there. In the meantime, Tim, I'm hungry
enough to eat my shoes."</p>

<p>"I'm wid ye there."</p>

<p>"We shall have to wait here long enough to cook a steak from
that bear. He seems to be in fine condition, and will give us
a good meal."</p>

<p>"There!" laughed the Irishman; "I knowed I had forgot something.
Your mither give me a good, big lunch for us both whin I was laving
yesterday, and it is in the residence beyant, onless yer pony
ate up the same whin we warn't watching him."</p>

<p>"Little fear of that," replied the pleased Warren. "It is hardly
the sort of food that he fancies. Come on; let's have a good meal,
and then we'll be off."</p>
