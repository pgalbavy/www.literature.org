<p>William's period of peculiar sensitiveness dated from that evening,
and Jane, in particular, caused him a great deal of anxiety. In
fact, he began to feel that Jane was a mortification which his
parents might have spared him, with no loss to themselves or to
the world. Not having shown that consideration for anybody, they
might at least have been less spinelessly indulgent of her. William's
bitter conviction was that he had never seen a child so starved
of discipline or so lost to etiquette as Jane.</p>

<p>For one thing, her passion for bread-and-butter, covered with
apple sauce and powdered sugar, was getting to be a serious matter.
Secretly, William was not yet so changed by love as to be wholly
indifferent to this refection himself, but his consumption of
it was private, whereas Jane had formed the habit of eating it
in exposed places&mdash;such as the front yard or the sidewalk. At
no hour of the day was it advisable for a relative to approach
the neighborhood in fastidious company, unless prepared to acknowledge
kinship with a spindly young person either eating bread-and-butter
and apple sauce and powdered sugar, or all too visibly just having
eaten bread-and-butter and apple sauce and powdered sugar. Moreover,
there were times when Jane had worse things than apple sauce to
answer for, as William made clear to his mother in an oration
as hot as the July noon sun which looked down upon it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter was pleasantly engaged with a sprinkling-can and
some small flower-beds in the shady back yard, and Jane, having
returned from various sidewalk excursions, stood close by as a
spectator, her hands replenished with the favorite food and her
chin rising and falling in gentle motions, little prophecies of
the slight distensions which passed down her slender throat with
slow, rhythmic regularity. Upon this calm scene came William,
plunging round a corner of the house, furious yet plaintive.</p>

<p>"You've got to do something about that child!" he began. "I <em>CAN
</em>not stand it!"</p>

<p>Jane looked at him dumbly, not ceasing, how ever, to eat; while
Mrs. Baxter thoughtfully continued her sprinkling.</p>

<p>"You've been gone all morning, Willie," she said. "I thought
your father mentioned at breakfast that he expected you to put
in at least four hours a day on your mathematics and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's neither here nor there," William returned, vehemently.
"I just want to say this: if you don't do something about Jane,
I will! Just look at her! <em>LOOK </em>at her, I ask you! That's
just the way she looked half an hour ago, out on the public sidewalk
in front of the house, when I came by here with Miss <em>PRATT!
</em>That was pleasant, wasn't it? To be walking with a lady on
the public street and meet a member of my family looking like
that! Oh, <em>LOVELY</em>!"</p>

<p>In the anguish of this recollection his voice cracked, and though
his eyes were dry his gestures wept for him. Plainly, he was about
to reach the most lamentable portion of his narrative. "And then
she <em>HOLLERED </em>at me! She hollered, 'Oh, <em>WILL&mdash;EE!</em>'"
Here he gave an imitation of Jane's voice, so damnatory that Jane
ceased to eat for several moments and drew herself up with a kind
of dignity. "She hollered, 'Oh, <em>WILL&mdash;EE</em>' at me!"
he stormed. "Anybody would think I was about six years old! She
hollered, 'Oh, Will&mdash;ee,' and she rubbed her stomach and slushed
apple sauce all over her face, and she kept hollering, 'Will&mdash;ee!'
with her mouth full. 'Will&mdash;ee, look! Good! Bread-and-butter and
apple sauce and sugar! I bet you wish <em>YOU </em>had some, Will&mdash;ee!'"</p>

<p>"You did eat some, the other day," said Jane. "You ate a whole
lot. You eat it every chance you get!"</p>

<p>"You hush up!" he shouted, and returned to his description of
the outrage. "She kept <em>FOLLOWING </em>us! She followed us,
hollering, '<em>WILL&mdash;EE!</em>' till it's a wonder we didn't
go deaf! And just look at her! I don't see how you can stand it
to have her going around like that and people knowing it's your
child! Why, she hasn't got enough ON!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter laughed. "Oh, for this very hot weather, I really
don't think people notice or care much about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Notice'!" he wailed. "I guess Miss <em>PRATT </em>noticed!
Hot weather's no excuse for&mdash;for outright obesity!" (As Jane was
thin, it is probable that William had mistaken the meaning of
this word.) "Why, half o' what she <em>HAS </em>got on has come
unfastened&mdash;especially that frightful thing hanging around her
leg&mdash;and look at her back, I just beg you! I ask you to look at
her back. You can see her spinal cord!"</p>

<p>"Column," Mrs. Baxter corrected. "Spinal column, Willie."</p>

<p>"What do <em>I</em> care which it is?" he fumed. "People aren't
supposed to go around with it <em>EXPOSED, </em>whichever it is!
And with apple sauce on their ears!"</p>

<p>"There is not!" Jane protested, and at the moment when she spoke
she was right. Naturally, however, she lifted her hands to the
accused ears, and the unfortunate result was to justify William's
statement.</p>

<p>"<em>LOOK!" </em>he cried. "I just ask you to look! Think of
it: that's the sight I have to meet when I'm out walking with
Miss <em>PRATT! </em>She asked me who it was, and I wish you'd
seen her face. She wanted to know who 'that curious child' was,
and I'm glad you didn't hear the way she said it. 'Who IS that
curious child?' she said, and I had to tell her it was my sister.
I had to tell Miss <em>PRATT </em>it was my only <em>SISTER</em>!"</p>

<p>"Willie, who is Miss Pratt?" asked Mrs. Baxter, mildly. "I don't
think I've ever heard of&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jane had returned to an admirable imperturbability, but she chose
this moment to interrupt her mother, and her own eating, with
remarks delivered in a tone void of emphasis or expression.</p>

<p>"Willie's mashed on her," she said, casually. "And she wears
false side-curls. One almost came off."</p>

<p>At this unspeakable desecration William's face was that of a
high priest stricken at the altar.</p>

<p>"She's visitin' Miss May Parcher," added the deadly Jane. "But
the Parchers are awful tired of her. They wish she'd go home,
but they don't like to tell her so."</p>

<p>One after another these insults from the canaille fell upon the
ears of William. That slanders so atrocious could soil the universal
air seemed unthinkable.</p>

<p>He became icily calm.</p>

<p>"<em>NOW </em>if you don't punish her," he said, deliberately,
"it's because you have lost your sense of duty!"</p>

<p>Having uttered these terrible words, he turned upon his heel
and marched toward the house. His mother called after him:</p>

<p>"Wait, Willie. Jane doesn't mean to hurt your feelings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My feelings!" he cried, the iciness of his demeanor giving way
under the strain of emotion. "You stand there and allow her to
speak as she did of one of the&mdash;one of the&mdash;" For a moment William
appeared to be at a loss, and the fact is that it always has been
a difficult matter to describe <em>THE </em>bright, ineffable
divinity of the world to one's mother, especially in the presence
of an inimical third party of tender years. "One of the&mdash;" he
said; "one of the&mdash;the noblest&mdash;one of the noblest&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again he paused.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jane didn't mean anything," said Mrs. Baxter. "And if you
think Miss Pratt is so nice, I'll ask May Parcher to bring her
to tea with us some day. If it's too hot, we'll have iced tea,
and you can ask Johnnie Watson, if you like. Don't get so upset
about things, Willie!"</p>

<p>"'Upset'!" he echoed, appealing to heaven against this word.
"'Upset'!"  And he entered the house in a manner most dramatic.</p>

<p>"What made you say that?" Mrs. Baxter asked, turning curiously
to Jane when William had disappeared. "Where did you hear any
such things?"</p>

<p>"I was there," Jane replied, gently eating on and on. William
could come and William could go, but Jane's alimentary canal went
on forever.</p>

<p>"You were where, Jane?"</p>

<p>"At the Parchers'."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see."</p>

<p>"Yesterday afternoon," said Jane, "when Miss Parcher had the
Sunday-school class for lemonade and cookies."</p>

<p>"Did you hear Miss Parcher say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No'm," said Jane. "I ate too many cookies, I guess, maybe. Anyways,
Miss Parcher said I better lay down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>LIE </em>down, Jane."</p>

<p>"Yes'm. On the sofa in the liberry, an' Mrs. Parcher an' Mr.
Parcher came in there an' sat down, after while, an' it was kind
of dark, an' they didn't hardly notice me, or I guess they thought
I was asleep, maybe. Anyways, they didn't talk loud, but Mr. Parcher
would sort of grunt an' ack cross. He said he just wished he knew
when he was goin' to have a home again. Then Mrs. Parcher said
May <em>HAD </em>to ask her Sunday-school class, but he said he
never meant the Sunday-school class. He said since Miss Pratt
came to visit, there wasn't anywhere he could go, because Willie
Baxter an' Johnnie Watson an' Joe Bullitt an' all the other ones
like that were there all the time, an' it made him just sick at
the stummick, an' he did wish there was some way to find out when
she was goin' home, because he couldn't stand much more talk about
love. He said Willie an' Johnnie Watson an' Joe Bullitt an' Miss
Pratt were always arguin' somep'm about love, an' he said Willie
was the worst. Mamma, he said he didn't like the rest of it, but
he said he guessed he could stand it if it wasn't for Willie.
An' he said the reason they were all so in love of Miss Pratt
was because she talks baby-talk, an' he said he couldn't stand
much more baby-talk. Mamma, she has the loveliest little white
dog, an' Mr. Parcher doesn't like it. He said he couldn't go anywhere
around the place without steppin' on the dog or Willie Baxter.
An' he said he couldn't sit on his own porch any more; he said
he couldn't sit even in the liberry but he had to hear baby-talk
goin' on SOMEwheres an' then either Willie Baxter or Joe Bullitt
or somebody or another arguin' about love. Mamma, he said" &mdash;Jane
became impressive&mdash;"he said, mamma, he said he didn't mind the
Sunday-school class, but he couldn't stand those dam boys!"</p>

<p>"Jane!" Mrs. Baxter cried, "you <em>MUSTN'T </em>say such things!"</p>

<p>"I didn't, mamma. Mr. Parcher said it. He said he couldn't stand
those da&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>JANE! </em>No matter what he said, you mustn't repeat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I'm not. I only said Mr. <em>PARCHER </em>said he couldn't
stand those d&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter cut the argument short by imprisoning Jane's mouth
with a firm hand. Jane continued to swallow quietly until released.
Then she said:</p>

<p>"But, mamma, how can I tell you what he said unless I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" Mrs. Baxter commanded. "You must never, never again use
such a terrible and wicked word."</p>

<p>"I won't, mamma," Jane said, meekly. Then she brightened. "Oh,
<em>I</em> know! I'll say 'word' instead. Won't that be all right?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Parcher said he couldn't stand those word boys. That
sounds all right, doesn't it, mamma?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter hesitated, but she was inclined to hear as complete
as possible a report of Mr. and Mrs. Parcher's conversation, since
it seemed to concern William so nearly; and she well knew that
Jane had her own way of telling things&mdash;or else they remained
untold.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I suppose so," Mrs. Baxter said, again.</p>

<p>"Well, they kind of talked along," Jane continued, much pleased;&mdash;"an'
Mr. Parcher said when he was young he wasn't any such a&mdash;such
a word fool as these young word fools were. He said in all his
born days Willie Baxter was the wordest fool he ever saw!"</p>

<p>Willie Baxter's mother flushed a little. "That was very unjust
and very wrong of Mr. Parcher," she said, primly.</p>

<p>"Oh no, mamma!" Jane protested. "Mrs. Parcher thought so, too."</p>

<p>"Did she, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Only she didn't say word or wordest or anything like that,"
Jane explained. "She said it was because Miss Pratt had coaxed
him to be so in love of her, an' Mr. Parcher said he didn't care
whose fault it was, Willie was a&mdash;a word calf an' so were all
the rest of 'em, Mr. Parcher said. An' he said he couldn't stand
it any more. Mr. Parcher said that a whole lot of times, mamma.
He said he guess' pretty soon he'd haf to be in the lunatic asylum
if Miss Pratt stayed a few more days with her word little dog
an' her word Willie Baxter an' all the other word calfs. Mrs.
Parcher said he oughtn't to say 'word,' mamma. She said, 'Hush,
hush!' to him, mamma. He talked like this, mamma: he said, 'I'll
be word if I stand it!' An' he kept gettin' crosser, an' he said,
'Word! Word! <em>WORD! WOR</em>&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"There!" Mrs. Baxter interrupted, sharply. "That will do, Jane!
We'll talk about something else now, I think."</p>

<p>Jane looked hurt; she was taking great pleasure in this confidential
interview, and gladly would have continued to quote the harried
Mr. Parcher at great length. Still, she was not entirely uncontent:
she must have had some perception that her performance merely
as a notable bit of reportorial art&mdash;did not wholly lack style,
even if her attire did. Yet, brilliant as Jane's work was, Mrs.
Baxter felt no astonishment; several times ere this Jane had demonstrated
a remarkable faculty for the retention of details concerning William.
And running hand in hand with a really superb curiosity, this
powerful memory was making Jane an even greater factor in William's
life than he suspected.</p>

<p>During the glamors of early love, if there be a creature more
deadly than the little brother of a budding woman, that creature
is the little sister of a budding man. The little brother at least
tells in the open all he knows, often at full power of his lungs,
and even that may be avoided, since he is wax in the hands of
bribery; but the little sister is more apt to save her knowledge
for use upon a terrible occasion; and, no matter what bribes she
may accept, she is certain to tell her mother everything. All
in all, a young lover should arrange, if possible, to be the only
child of elderly parents; otherwise his mother and sister are
sure to know a great deal more about him than he knows that they
know.</p>

<p>This was what made Jane's eyes so disturbing to William during
lunch that day. She ate quietly and competently, but all the while
he was conscious of her solemn and inscrutable gaze fixed upon
him; and she spoke not once. She could not have rendered herself
more annoying, especially as William was trying to treat her with
silent scorn, for nothing is more irksome to the muscles of the
face than silent scorn, when there is no means of showing it except
by the expression. On the other hand, Jane's inscrutability gave
her no discomfort whatever. In fact, inscrutability is about the
most comfortable expression that a person can wear, though the
truth is that just now Jane was not really inscrutable at all.</p>

<p>She was merely looking at William and thinking of Mr. Parcher.</p>
