<P>
Mr. Sinclair, or as he preferred to be called, Professor Sinclair, waved a
white kid glove in the direction of the dancing hall.
<P>
"This way, ladies and gentlemen!" he announced. "A beautiful valse just about
to commence. Tickets, if you please! Ah! Glad to see you, Miss Cullingham!
You'll find--a friend of yours inside!"
<P>
There was a good deal of giggling as the girls came out from the little
dressing room and joined their waiting escorts, who stood in a line against
the wall, mostly struggling with refractory gloves. Mr. Sinclair, proprietor
of the West Islington Dancing Academy, and host of these little
gatherings--for a consideration of eighteenpence--did his best, by a running
fire of conversation, to set everyone at their ease. He wore a somewhat rusty
frock coat, black trousers, a white dress waistcoat, and a red tie. Evening
dress was not DE RIGUEUR! The money at the door, and that everyone should
behave as ladies and gentlemen, were the only things insisted upon.
<P>
Mr. Sinclair's best smile and most correct bow was suddenly in evidence.
<P>
"Mademoiselle Violet!" he exclaimed to a lady who came in alone, "we are
enchanted. We feared that you had deserted us. There is a young gentleman
inside who is going to be made very happy. One shilling change, thank you.
Won't you step into the cloak room?"
<P>
The lady shook her head.
<P>
"If you don't mind, Mr. Sinclair," she said, "I would rather keep my hat and
veil on. I can only stay for a few minutes. Is Mr. Richardson here, do you
know? Ah! I can see him."
<P>
She stepped past the Professor into the little dancing hall. A young lady was
pounding upon a piano, a boy at her side was playing the violin. A few couples
were dancing, but most of the company was looking on. The evening was young,
and Mr. Sinclair, who later on officiated as M.C., had not yet made his attack
upon the general shyness. The lady known as Mademoiselle Violet paused and
looked around her. Suddenly she caught sight of a pale, anemic-looking youth,
who was standing apart from the others, lounging against the wall. She moved
rapidly towards him.
<P>
"How do you do, Mr. Richardson?" she said, holding out her hand.
<P>
He started, and a sudden rush of color streamed into his cheeks. He took her
hand awkwardly, and he was almost speechless with nervousness.
<P>
"I don't believe you're at all glad to see me!" she remarked.
<P>
"Oh! Miss Violet!" he exclaimed. He would have said more, but the words stuck
in his throat.
<P>
"Can we sit down somewhere?" she said. "I want to talk to you."
<P>
There were one or two chairs placed behind a red drugget curtain, where
adventurous spirits led their partners later in the evening. They found a
place there, and the young man recovered his power of speech.
<P>
"Not glad to see you!" he exclaimed almost vehemently. "Why, what else do you
suppose I come here for every Thursday evening? I never dance; they all make
game of me because they know I come here on the chance of seeing you again.
I'm a fool! I know that! You just amuse yourself here with me, and then you go
away, back to your friends--and forget! And I hang about round here, like the
silly ass that I am!"
<P>
"My dear--George!"
<P>
The young man blushed at the sound of his Christian name. He was mollified
despite himself.
<P>
"I suppose it's got to be the same thing all over again," he declared
resignedly. "You'll talk to me and let me be near you--and make a fool of me
all round; and then you'll go away, and heaven knows when I'll see you again.
You won't let me take you home, and won't tell me where you live, or who your
friends are. You do treat me precious badly, Miss Violet."
<P>
"This time," she said quietly, "it will not be the same. I have something
quite serious to say to you."
<P>
"Something serious--you? Go on!" he exclaimed in excitement.
<P>
"Have you found another place yet?"
<P>
"No. I haven't really tried. I have a little money saved, and I could get one
tomorrow if--"
<P>
She stopped him with a smiling gesture.
<P>
"I don't mean that--yet," she said. "I wanted to know whether it would be
possible for you to go away for a little time, if someone paid all your
expenses."
<P>
"To go away!" he repeated blankly. "What for?"
<P>
Mademoiselle Violet leaned a little nearer to him.
<P>
"My mistress asked me yesterday," she said, "if I knew anyone who could be
trusted who would go away, at a moment's notice, on an errand for her."
<P>
"Your mistress," he repeated. "You really are a lady's maid, then, are you?"
<P>
"Of course!" she answered impatiently. "Haven't I told you so before? Now what
do you say? Will you go?"
<P>
"I dunno," he answered thoughtfully. "If it had been for you, I don't know
that I'd have minded. I ain't fond of traveling."
<P>
"It is for me," she interrupted hastily. "If I can find her anyone who will do
what she wants, she will make my fortune. She has promised. And then--"
<P>
"Well, and then?"
<P>
Mademoiselle Violet looked at him thoughtfully.
<P>
"I should not make any promises," she said demurely, "but things would
certainly be different."
<P>
The young man's blood was stirred. Mademoiselle Violet stood to him for the
whole wonderful world of romance, into which he had peered dimly from behind
the counter of an Islington emporium. Her low voice--so strange to his ears
after the shrill chatter of the young ladies of his acquaintance--the mystery
of her coming and going, all went to give color to the single dream of his
unimaginative life. Apart from her, he was a somewhat vulgar, entirely
commonplace young man, of saving habits, and with some aptitude for business,
in a small way. He had been well on his way to becoming a small but successful
shopkeeper, thereby realizing the only ideals which had yet presented
themselves to him, when Madame Violet had unconsciously intervened. Of what
might become of him now he had no clear conception of himself.
<P>
"I'll go!" he declared.
<P>
Mademoiselle Violet's eyes flashed behind her veil. Her fingers touched his
for a moment.
<P>
"It is a long way," she said.
<P>
"I don't care," he answered valiantly.
<P>
"To--America!"
<P>
"America!" he gasped. "But--is this a joke, Miss Violet?"
<P>
She shook her head.
<P>
"Of course not!" America is not a great journey."
<P>
"But it will cost--"
<P>
She laughed softly.
<P>
"My mistress is very rich," she said. "The cost does not matter at all. You
will have all the money you can spend--and more."
<P>
He felt himself short of breath, and bereft of words.
<P>
"Gee whiz!" he murmured.
<P>
They sat there in silence for a few moments. A promenading couple put their
heads behind the screen, and withdrew with the sound of feminine giggling.
Outside, the piano was being thumped to the tune of a popular polka.
<P>
"But what have I go to do?" he asked.
<P>
"To watch a man who will go out by the same steamer as you," she answered.
"Write to London, tell me what he does, how he spends his time, whether he is
ill or well. You must stay at the same hotel in New York, and try and find out
what his business is there. Remember, we want to know, my mistress and I,
everything that he does."
<P>
"Who is he?" he asked. "A friend of your mistress?"
<P>
"No!" she answered shortly, "an enemy. A cruel enemy--the cruelest enemy a
woman could have!"
<P>
The subdued passion of her tone thrilled him. He felt himself bewildered--in
touch with strange things. She leaned a little closer towards him, and that
mysterious perfume, which was one of her many fascinations, dazed him with its
sweetness.
<P>
"If you could send home word," she whispered, "that he was ill, that anything
had happened to him, that he was not likely to return--our fortunes would be
made--yours and mine."
<P>
"Stop!" he muttered. "You--phew! It's hot here!"
<P>
He wiped the perspiration recklessly from his forehead with a red silk
handkerchief.
<P>
"What made you come to me?" he asked. "I don't even know the name of your
mistress."
<P>
"And you must not ask it," she declared quietly. "It is better for you not to
know. I came to you because you were a man, and I knew that I could trust
you."
<P>
Her flattery sank into his soul. No one else had ever called him a man. He
felt himself capable of great things. To think that, but for the coming of
this wonderful Mademoiselle Violet, he might even now have been furnishing a
small shop on the outskirts of Islington, with collars and ties and gloves
designed to attract the youth of that populous neighborhood!
<P>
"When do I start?" he asked with a coolness which surprised himself.
<P>
She drew a heavy packet from the recesses of the muff she carried.
<P>
"All the particulars are here," she said. "The name of the steamer, the name
of the man, and money. You will be told where to get more in New York, if you
need it."
<P>
He took it from her mechanically. She rose to her feet.
<P>
"You will remember," she said, looking into his eyes.
<P>
"I ain't likely to forget anything you've said tonight," he answered honestly.
"But look here! Let me take you home--just this once! Give me something to
think about."
<P>
She shook her head.
<P>
"I will give you something to hope for," she whispered. "You must not come a
yard with me. When you come back it will, perhaps--be different."
<P>
He remained behind the partition, gripping the packet tightly. Mademoiselle
Violet took a hasty adieu of Mr. Sinclair, and descended to the street. She
walked for a few yards, and then turned sharply to the left. A hansom, into
which she stepped at once, was waiting there. She wrapped herself hastily in a
long fur coat which lay upon the seat, and thrust her hand through the trap
door.
<P>
"St. Martin's Schoolroom!" she told the cabman.
<P>
Apparently Mademoiselle Violet combined a taste for philanthropy with her
penchant for Islington dancing halls. She entered the little schoolroom and
made her way to the platform, dispensing many smiles and nods amongst the
audience of the concert, which was momentarily interrupted for her benefit.
She was escorted on to the platform by a young and earnest-looking clergyman,
and given a chair in the center of the little group who were gathered there.
And after the conclusion of the song, the clergyman expressed his
gratification to the audience that a lady with so many calls upon her time,
such high social duties, should yet find time to show her deep interest in
their welfare by this most kind visit. After which, he ventured to call upon
Lady Barrington to say a few words.
