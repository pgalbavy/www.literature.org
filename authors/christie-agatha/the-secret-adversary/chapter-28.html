<p>"<em>THAT </em>was a mighty good toast, Jane," said Mr. Hersheimmer,
as he and his cousin were being driven back in the Rolls-Royce
to the <em>Ritz</em>.</p>

<p>"The one to the joint venture?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;the one to you. There isn’t another girl in the world who
could have carried it through as you did. You were just wonderful!"</p>

<p>Jane shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don’t feel wonderful. At heart I’m just tired and lonesome&mdash;and
longing for my own country."</p>

<p>"That brings me to something I wanted to say. I heard the Ambassador
telling you his wife hoped you would come to them at the Embassy
right away. That’s good enough, but I’ve got another plan. Jane
&mdash;I want you to marry me! Don’t get scared and say no at
once. You can’t love me right away, of course, that’s impossible.
But I’ve loved you from the very moment I set eyes on your photo&mdash;and
now I’ve seen you I’m simply crazy about you! If you’ll only marry
me, I won’t worry you any&mdash;you shall take your own time. Maybe
you’ll never come to love me, and if that’s the case I’ll manage
to set you free. But I want the right to look after you, and take
care of you."</p>

<p>"That’s what I want," said the girl wistfully. "Some one who’ll
be good to me. Oh, you don’t know how lonesome I feel!"</p>

<p>"Sure thing I do. Then I guess that’s all fixed up, and I’ll
see the archbishop about a special license to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, Julius!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don’t want to hustle you any, Jane, but there’s no sense
in waiting about. Don’t be scared &mdash;I shan’t expect you to
love me all at once."</p>

<p>But a small hand was slipped into his.</p>

<p>"I love you now, Julius," said Jane Finn. "I loved you that first
moment in the car when the bullet grazed your cheek...."</p>

<p>Five minutes later Jane murmured softly:</p>

<p>"I don’t know London very well, Julius, but is it such a very
long way from the <em>Savoy</em> to the <em>Ritz?</em>"</p>

<p>"It depends how you go," explained Julius unblushingly. "We’re
going by way of Regent’s Park!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Julius&mdash;what will the chauffeur think?"</p>

<p>"At the wages I pay him, he knows better than to do any independent
thinking. Why, Jane, the only reason I had the supper at the <em>Savoy</em>
was so that I could drive you home. I didn’t see how I was ever
going to get hold of you alone. You and Tuppence have been sticking
together like Siamese twins. I guess another day of it would have
driven me and Beresford stark staring mad!"</p>

<p>"Oh. Is he&#11834;?"</p>

<p>"Of course he is. Head over ears."</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Jane thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"From all the things Tuppence didn’t say!"</p>

<p>"There you have me beat," said Mr. Hersheimmer. But Jane only
laughed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Young Adventurers were sitting bolt upright,
very stiff and ill at ease, in a taxi which, with a singular lack
of originality, was also returning to the <em>Ritz</em> via Regent’s
Park.</p>

<p>A terrible constraint seemed to have settled down between them.
Without quite knowing what had happened, everything seemed changed.
They were tongue-tied&mdash;paralysed. All the old <em>camaraderie</em>
was gone.</p>

<p>Tuppence could think of nothing to say.</p>

<p>Tommy was equally afflicted.</p>

<p>They sat very straight and forbore to look at each other.</p>

<p>At last Tuppence made a desperate effort.</p>

<p>"Rather fun, wasn’t it?"</p>

<p>"Rather."</p>

<p>Another silence.</p>

<p>"I like Julius," essayed Tuppence again.</p>

<p>Tommy was suddenly galvanized into life.</p>

<p>"You’re not going to marry him, do you hear?" he said dictatorially.
"I forbid it."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Tuppence meekly.</p>

<p>"Absolutely, you understand."</p>

<p>"He doesn’t want to marry me&mdash;he really only asked me out of
kindness."</p>

<p>"That’s not very likely," scoffed Tommy.</p>

<p>"It’s quite true. He’s head over ears in love with Jane. I expect
he’s proposing to her now."</p>

<p>"She’ll do for him very nicely," said Tommy condescendingly.</p>

<p>"Don’t you think she’s the most lovely creature you’ve ever seen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say."</p>

<p>"But I suppose you prefer sterling worth," said Tuppence demurely.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>oh, dash it all, Tuppence, you know!"</p>

<p>"I like your uncle, Tommy," said Tuppence, hastily creating a
diversion. "By the way, what are you going to do, accept Mr. Carter’s
offer of a Government job, or accept Julius’s invitation and take
a richly remunerated post in America on his ranch?"</p>

<p>"I shall stick to the old ship, I think, though it’s awfully
good of Hersheimmer. But I feel you’d be more at home in London."</p>

<p>"I don’t see where I come in."</p>

<p>"I do," said Tommy positively.</p>

<p>Tuppence stole a glance at him sideways.</p>

<p>"There’s the money, too," she observed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"What money?"</p>

<p>"We’re going to get a cheque each. Mr. Carter told me so."</p>

<p>"Did you ask how much?" inquired Tommy sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tuppence triumphantly. "But I shan’t tell you."</p>

<p>"Tuppence, you are the limit!"</p>

<p>"It has been fun, hasn’t it, Tommy? I do hope we shall have lots
more adventures."</p>

<p>"You’re insatiable, Tuppence. I’ve had quite enough adventures
for the present."</p>

<p>"Well, shopping is almost as good," said Tuppence dreamily. "Think
of buying old furniture, and bright carpets, and futurist silk
curtains, and a polished dining-table, and a divan with lots of
cushions."</p>

<p>"Hold hard," said Tommy. "What’s all this for?"</p>

<p>"Possibly a house&mdash;but I think a flat."</p>

<p>"Whose flat?"</p>

<p>"You think I mind saying it, but I don’t in the least! <em>Ours</em>,
so there!"</p>

<p>"You darling!" cried Tommy, his arms tightly round her. "I was
determined to make you say it. I owe you something for the relentless
way you’ve squashed me whenever I’ve tried to be sentimental."</p>

<p>Tuppence raised her face to his. The taxi proceeded on its course
round the north side of Regent’s Park.</p>

<p>"You haven’t really proposed now," pointed out Tuppence. "Not
what our grandmothers would call a proposal. But after listening
to a rotten one like Julius’s, I’m inclined to let you off."</p>

<p>"You won’t be able to get out of marrying me, so don’t you think
it."</p>

<p>"What fun it will be," responded Tuppence. "Marriage is called
all sorts of things, a haven, and a refuge, and a crowning glory,
and a state of bondage, and lots more. But do you know what I
think it is?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"A sport!"</p>

<p>"And a damned good sport too," said Tommy.</p>
