<p>Sam, Penrod, Herman, and Verman withdrew in considerable state
from non-paying view, and, repairing to the hay-loft, declared
the exhibition open to the public. Oral proclamation was made
by Sam, and then the loitering multitude was enticed by the seductive
strains of a band; the two partners performing upon combs and
paper, Herman and Verman upon tin pans with sticks.</p>

<p>The effect was immediate. Visitors appeared upon the stairway
and sought admission. Herman and Verman took position among the
exhibits, near the wall; Sam stood at the entrance, officiating
as barker and ticket-seller; while Penrod, with debonair suavity,
acted as curator, master of ceremonies, and lecturer. He greeted
the first to enter with a courtly bow. They consisted of Miss
Rennsdale and her nursery governess, and they paid spot cash for
their admission.</p>

<p>"Walk in, lay-deeze, walk right in&mdash;pray do not obstruck the
passageway," said Penrod, in a remarkable voice. "Pray be seated;
there is room for each and all."</p>

<p>Miss Rennsdale and governess were followed by Mr. Georgie Bassett
and baby sister (which proves the perfection of Georgie's character)
and six or seven other neighbourhood children&mdash;a most satisfactory
audience, although, subsequent to Miss Rennsdale and governess,
admission was wholly by pin.</p>

<p>"<em>GEN-</em>til-mun and <em>LAY-</em>deeze," shouted Penrod,
"I will first call your at-tain-shon to our genuine South American
dog, part alligator!" He pointed to the dachshund, and added,
in his ordinary tone, "That's him."  Straightway reassuming the
character of showman, he bellowed: "<em>NEXT, </em>you see Duke,
the genuine, full-blooded Indian dog from the far Western Plains
and Rocky Mountains. <em>NEXT, </em>the trained Michigan rats,
captured way up there, and trained to jump and run all around
the box at the&mdash;at the&mdash;at the slightest <em>PRE-</em>text!" He
paused, partly to take breath and partly to enjoy his own surprised
discovery that this phrase was in his vocabulary.</p>

<p>"At the slightest <em>PRE-</em>text!" he repeated, and continued,
suiting the action to the word: "I will now hammer upon the box
and each and all may see these genuine full-blooded Michigan rats
perform at the slightest <em>PRE-</em>text! There! (That's all
they do now, but I and Sam are goin' to train 'em lots more before
this afternoon.) <em>GEN-</em>til-mun and <em>LAY-</em>deeze I
will kindly now call your at-tain-shon to Sherman, the wild animal
from Africa, costing the lives of the wild trapper and many of
his companions. <em>NEXT, </em>let me kindly interodoos Herman
and Verman. Their father got mad and stuck his pitchfork right
inside of another man, exactly as promised upon the advertisements
outside the big tent, and got put in jail. Look at them well,
gen-til-mun and lay-deeze, there is no extra charge, and <em>RE-MEM-BUR
</em>you are each and all now looking at two wild, tattooed men
which the father of is in jail. Point, Herman. Each and all will
have a chance to see. Point to sumpthing else, Herman. This is
the only genuine one-fingered tattooed wild man. Last on the programme,
gen-til-mun and lay-deeze, we have Verman, the savage tattooed
wild boy, that can't speak only his native foreign languages.
Talk some, Verman."</p>

<p>Verman obliged and made an instantaneous hit. He was encored
rapturously, again and again; and, thrilling with the unique pleasure
of being appreciated and misunderstood at the same time, would
have talked all day but too gladly. Sam Williams, however, with
a true showman's foresight, whispered to Penrod, who rang down
on the monologue.</p>

<p>"<em>GEN-</em>til-mun and <em>LAY-</em>deeze, this closes our
pufformance. Pray pass out quietly and with as little jostling
as possible. As soon as you are all out there's goin' to be a
new pufformance, and each and all are welcome at the same and
simple price of admission. Pray pass out quietly and with as little
jostling as possible. <em>RE-MEM-BUR </em>the price is only one
cent, the tenth part of a dime, or twenty pins, no bent ones taken.
Pray pass out quietly and with as little jostling as possible.
The Schofield and Williams Military Band will play before each
pufformance, and each and all are welcome for the same and simple
price of admission. Pray pass out quietly and with as little jostling
as possible."</p>

<p>Forthwith, the Schofield and Williams Military Band began a second
overture, in which something vaguely like a tune was at times
distinguishable; and all of the first audience returned, most
of them having occupied the interval in hasty excursions for more
pins; Miss Rennsdale and governess, however, again paying coin
of the Republic and receiving deference and the best seats accordingly.
And when a third performance found all of the same inveterate
patrons once more crowding the auditorium, and seven recruits
added, the pleasurable excitement of the partners in their venture
will be understood by any one who has seen a metropolitan manager
strolling about the foyer of his theatre some evening during the
earlier stages of an assured "phenomenal run."</p>

<p>From the first, there was no question which feature of the entertainment
was the attraction extraordinary: Verman &mdash;Verman, the savage
tattooed wild boy, speaking only his native foreign languages
&mdash;Verman was a triumph! Beaming, wreathed in smiles, melodious,
incredibly fluent, he had but to open his lips and a dead hush
fell upon the audience. Breathless, they leaned forward, hanging
upon his every semi-syllable, and, when Penrod checked the flow,
burst into thunders of applause, which Verman received with happy
laughter.</p>

<p>Alas! he delayed not o'er long to display all the egregiousness
of a new star; but for a time there was no caprice of his too
eccentric to be forgiven. During Penrod's lecture upon the other
curios, the tattooed wild boy continually stamped his foot, grinned,
and gesticulated, tapping his tiny chest, and pointing to himself
as it were to say: "Wait for Me! I am the Big Show." So soon they
learn; so soon they learn! And (again alas!) this spoiled darling
of public favour, like many another, was fated to know, in good
time, the fickleness of that favour.</p>

<p>But during all the morning performances he was the idol of his
audience and looked it! The climax of his popularity came during
the fifth overture of the Schofield and Williams Military Band,
when the music was quite drowned in the agitated clamours of Miss
Rennsdale, who was endeavouring to ascend the stairs in spite
of the physical dissuasion of her governess.</p>

<p>"I <em>WON'T </em>go home to lunch!" screamed Miss Rennsdale,
her voice accompanied by a sound of ripping. "I <em>WILL </em>hear
the tattooed wild boy talk some more! It's lovely &mdash;I <em>WILL
</em>hear him talk! I <em>WILL! I WILL! I </em>want to listen
to Verman&mdash;I <em>WANT </em>to &mdash;I <em>WANT </em>to&#11834;"</p>

<p>Wailing, she was borne away&mdash;of her sex not the first to be fascinated
by obscurity, nor the last to champion its eloquence.</p>

<p>Verman was almost unendurable after this, but, like many, many
other managers, Schofield and Williams restrained their choler,
and even laughed fulsomely when their principal attraction essayed
the role of a comedian in private, and capered and squawked in
sheer, fatuous vanity.</p>

<p>The first performance of the afternoon rivalled the successes
of the morning, and although Miss Rennsdale was detained at home,
thus drying up the single source of cash income developed before
lunch, Maurice Levy appeared, escorting Marjorie Jones, and paid
coin for two admissions, dropping the money into Sam's hand with
a careless&mdash;nay, a contemptuous&mdash;gesture. At sight of Marjorie,
Penrod Schofield flushed under his new moustache (repainted since
noon) and lectured as he had never lectured before. A new grace
invested his every gesture; a new sonorousness rang in his voice;
a simple and manly pomposity marked his very walk as he passed
from curio to curio. And when he fearlessly handled the box of
rats and hammered upon it with cool insouciance, he beheld&mdash;for
the first time in his life&mdash;a purl of admiration eddying in Marjorie's
lovely eye, a certain softening of that eye. And then Verman spake
and Penrod was forgotten. Marjorie's eye rested upon him no more.</p>

<p>A heavily equipped chauffeur ascended the stairway, bearing the
message that Mrs. Levy awaited her son and his lady. Thereupon,
having devoured the last sound permitted (by the managers) to
issue from Verman, Mr. Levy and Miss Jones departed to a real
matinee at a real theatre, the limpid eyes of Marjorie looking
back softly over her shoulder&mdash;but only at the tattooed wild boy.
Nearly always it is woman who puts the irony into life.</p>

<p>After this, perhaps because of sated curiosity, perhaps on account
of a pin famine, the attendance began to languish. Only four responded
to the next call of the band; the four dwindled to three; finally
the entertainment was given for one blase auditor, and Schofield
and Williams looked depressed. Then followed an interval when
the band played in vain.</p>

<p>About three o'clock Schofield and Williams were gloomily discussing
various unpromising devices for startling the public into a renewal
of interest, when another patron unexpectedly appeared and paid
a cent for his admission. News of the Big Show and Museum of Curiosities
had at last penetrated the far, cold spaces of interstellar niceness,
for this new patron consisted of no less than Roderick Magsworth
Bitts, Junior, escaped in a white "sailor suit" from the Manor
during a period of severe maternal and tutorial preoccupation.</p>

<p>He seated himself without parley, and the pufformance was offered
for his entertainment with admirable conscientiousness. True to
the Lady Clara caste and training, Roderick's pale, fat face expressed
nothing except an impervious superiority and, as he sat, cold
and unimpressed upon the front bench, like a large, white lump,
it must be said that he made a discouraging audience "to play
to." He was not, however, unresponsive&mdash;far from it. He offered
comment very chilling to the warm grandiloquence of the orator.</p>

<p>"That's my uncle Ethelbert's dachshund," he remarked, at the
beginning of the lecture. "You better take him back if you don't
want to get arrested." And when Penrod, rather uneasily ignoring
the interruption, proceeded to the exploitation of the genuine,
full-blooded Indian dog, Duke, "Why don't you try to give that
old dog away?" asked Roderick. "You couldn't sell him."</p>

<p>"My papa would buy me a lots better 'coon than that," was the
information volunteered a little later, "only I wouldn't want
the nasty old thing."</p>

<p>Herman of the missing finger obtained no greater indulgence.
"Pooh!"  said Roderick. "We have two fox-terriers in our stables
that took prizes at the kennel show, and their tails were <em>BIT
</em>off. There's a man that always bites fox-terriers' tails
off."</p>

<p>"Oh, my gosh, what a lie!" exclaimed Sam Williams ignorantly.</p>

<p>"Go on with the show whether he likes it or not, Penrod. He's
paid his money."</p>

<p>Verman, confident in his own singular powers, chuckled openly
at the failure of the other attractions to charm the frosty visitor,
and, when his turn came, poured forth a torrent of conversation
which was straightway damned.</p>

<p>"Rotten," said Mr. Bitts languidly. "Anybody could talk like
that. <em>I</em> could do it if I wanted to."</p>

<p>Verman paused suddenly.</p>

<p>"<em>YES, </em>you could!" exclaimed Penrod, stung. "Let's hear
you do it, then."</p>

<p>"Yessir!" the other partner shouted. "Let's just hear you DO
it!"</p>

<p>"I said I could if I wanted to," responded Roderick. "I didn't
say I <em>WOULD</em>."</p>

<p>"Yay! Knows he can't!" sneered Sam.</p>

<p>"I can, too, if I try."</p>

<p>"Well, let's hear you try!"</p>

<p>So challenged, the visitor did try, but, in the absence of an
impartial jury, his effort was considered so pronounced a failure
that he was howled down, derided, and mocked with great clamours.</p>

<p>"Anyway," said Roderick, when things had quieted down, "if I
couldn't get up a better show than this I'd sell out and leave
town."</p>

<p>Not having enough presence of mind to inquire what he would sell
out, his adversaries replied with mere formless yells of scorn.</p>

<p>"I could get up a better show than this with my left hand," Roderick
asserted.</p>

<p>"Well, what would you have in your ole show?" asked Penrod, condescending
to language.</p>

<p>"That's all right, what I'd <em>HAVE. I'</em>d have enough!"</p>

<p>"You couldn't get Herman and Verman in your ole show."</p>

<p>"No, and I wouldn't want 'em, either!"</p>

<p>"Well, what <em>WOULD </em>you have?" insisted Penrod derisively.
"You'd have to have <em>SUMPTHING&mdash;</em>you couldn't be a show
yourself!"</p>

<p>"How do <em>YOU </em>know?" This was but meandering while waiting
for ideas, and evoked another yell.</p>

<p>"You think you could be a show all by yourself?" demanded Penrod.</p>

<p>"How do <em>YOU </em>know I couldn't?"</p>

<p>Two white boys and two black boys shrieked their scorn of the
boaster.</p>

<p>"I could, too!" Roderick raised his voice to a sudden howl, obtaining
a hearing.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you tell us how?"</p>

<p>"Well, <em>I</em> know <em>HOW, </em>all right," said Roderick.
"If anybody asks you, you can just tell him I know <em>HOW, </em>all
right."</p>

<p>"Why, you can't DO anything," Sam began argumentatively. "You
talk about being a show all by yourself; what could you try to
do? Show us sumpthing you can do."</p>

<p>"I didn't say I was going to DO anything," returned the badgered
one, still evading.</p>

<p>"Well, then, how'd you BE a show?" Penrod demanded. "WE got a
show here, even if Herman didn't point or Verman didn't talk.
Their father stabbed a man with a pitchfork, I guess, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"How do <em>I</em> know?"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess he's in jail, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"Well, what if their father is in jail? I didn't say he wasn't,
did I?"</p>

<p>"Well, <em>YOUR </em>father ain't in jail, is he?"</p>

<p>"Well, I never said he was, did I?"</p>

<p>"Well, then," continued Penrod, "how could you be a&#11834;" He stopped
abruptly, staring at Roderick, the birth of an idea plainly visible
in his altered expression. He had suddenly remembered his intention
to ask Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, about Rena Magsworth,
and this recollection collided in his mind with the irritation
produced by Roderick's claiming some mysterious attainment which
would warrant his setting up as a show in his single person. Penrod's
whole manner changed instantly.</p>

<p>"Roddy," he asked, almost overwhelmed by a prescience of something
vast and magnificent, "Roddy, are you any relation of Rena Magsworth?"</p>

<p>Roderick had never heard of Rena Magsworth, although a concentration
of the sentence yesterday pronounced upon her had burned, black
and horrific, upon the face of every newspaper in the country.
He was not allowed to read the journals of the day and his family's
indignation over the sacrilegious coincidence of the name had
not been expressed in his presence. But he saw that it was an
awesome name to Penrod Schofield and Samuel Williams. Even Herman
and Verman, though lacking many educational advantages on account
of a long residence in the country, were informed on the subject
of Rena Magsworth through hearsay, and they joined in the portentous
silence.</p>

<p>"Roddy," repeated Penrod, "honest, is Rena Magsworth some relation
of yours?"</p>

<p>There is no obsession more dangerous to its victims than a conviction
especially an inherited one&mdash;of superiority: this world is so
full of Missourians. And from his earliest years Roderick Magsworth
Bitts, Junior, had been trained to believe in the importance of
the Magsworth family. At every meal he absorbed a sense of Magsworth
greatness, and yet, in his infrequent meetings with persons of
his own age and sex, he was treated as negligible. Now, dimly,
he perceived that there was a Magsworth claim of some sort which
was impressive, even to boys. Magsworth blood was the essential
of all true distinction in the world, he knew. Consequently, having
been driven into a cul-de-sac, as a result of flagrant and unfounded
boasting, he was ready to take advantage of what appeared to be
a triumphal way out.</p>

<p>"Roddy," said Penrod again, with solemnity, "is Rena Magsworth
some relation of yours?"</p>

<p>"IS she, Roddy?" asked Sam, almost hoarsely.</p>

<p>"She's my aunt!" shouted Roddy.</p>

<p>Silence followed. Sam and Penrod, spellbound, gazed upon Roderick
Magsworth Bitts, Junior. So did Herman and Verman. Roddy's staggering
lie had changed the face of things utterly. No one questioned
it; no one realized that it was much too good to be true.</p>

<p>"Roddy," said Penrod, in a voice tremulous with hope, "Roddy,
will you join our show?"</p>

<p>Roddy joined.</p>

<p>Even he could see that the offer implied his being starred as
the paramount attraction of a new order of things. It was obvious
that he had swelled out suddenly, in the estimation of the other
boys, to that importance which he had been taught to believe his
native gift and natural right. The sensation was pleasant. He
had often been treated with effusion by grown-up callers and by
acquaintances of his mothers and sisters; he had heard ladies
speak of him as "charming" and "that delightful child," and little
girls had sometimes shown him deference, but until this moment
no boy had ever allowed him, for one moment, to presume even to
equality. Now, in a trice, he was not only admitted to comradeship,
but patently valued as something rare and sacred to be acclaimed
and pedestalled. In fact, the very first thing that Schofield
and Williams did was to find a box for him to stand upon.</p>

<p>The misgivings roused in Roderick's bosom by the subsequent activities
of the firm were not bothersome enough to make him forego his
prominence as Exhibit A. He was not a "quick-minded" boy, and
it was long (and much happened) before he thoroughly comprehended
the causes of his new celebrity. He had a shadowy feeling that
if the affair came to be heard of at home it might not be liked,
but, intoxicated by the glamour and bustle which surround a public
character, he made no protest. On the contrary, he entered whole-heartedly
into the preparations for the new show. Assuming, with Sam's assistance,
a blue moustache and "side-burns," he helped in the painting of
a new poster, which, supplanting the old one on the wall of the
stable facing the cross-street, screamed bloody murder at the
passers in that rather populous thoroughfare.</p>
