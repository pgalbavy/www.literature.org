<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>That meeting with Lumley scared me badly, but it also clinched
my resolution.  The most pacific fellow on earth can be gingered
into pugnacity.  I had now more than my friendship for Tommy and
my sympathy with Pitt-Heron to urge me on.  A man had tried to
bully me, and that roused all the worst stubbornness of my soul. 
I was determined to see the game through at any cost.</p>

<p>But I must have an ally if my nerves were to hold out, and my
mind turned at once to Tommy's friend Chapman.  I thought with
comfort of the bluff independence of the Labour member.  So that
night at the House I hunted him out in the smoking-room.</p>

<p>He had been having a row with the young bloods of my party that
afternoon and received me ungraciously.</p>

<p>"I'm about sick of you fellows," he growled.  (I shall not attempt
to reproduce Chapman's accent.  He spoke rich Yorkshire with a
touch of the drawl of the western dales.) "They went and spoiled
the best speech, though I say it as shouldn't, which this old
place has heard for a twelvemonth.  I've been workin' for days
at it in the Library. I was tellin' them how much more bread cost
under Protection, and the Jew Hilderstein started a laugh because
I said kilometres for kilogrammes.  It was just a slip o' the
tongue, for I had it right in my notes, and besides there furrin'
words don't matter a curse.  Then that young lord as sits for
East Claygate gets up and goes out as I was gettin' into my peroration,
and he drops his topper and knocks off old Higgins's spectacles,
and all the idiots laughed.  After that I gave it them hot and
strong, and got called to order.  And then Wattles, him as used
to be as good a socialist as me, replied for the Government and
his blamed Board and said that the Board thought this and the
Board thought that, and was damned if the Board would stir its
stumps.  Well I mind the day when I was hanging on to the Board's
coat-tails in Hyde Park to keep it from talking treason."</p>

<p>It took me a long time to get Chapman settled down and anchored
to a drink.</p>

<p>"I want you," I said, "to tell me about Routh&mdash;you know the fellow
I mean&mdash;the ex-Union-Leader."</p>

<p>At that he fairly blazed up.</p>

<p>"There you are, you Tories," he shouted, causing a pale Liberal
member on the next sofa to make a hurried exit.  "You can't fight
fair.  You hate the Unions, and you rake up any rotten old prejudice
to discredit them.  You can find out about Routh for yourself,
for I'm damned if I help you."</p>

<p>I saw I could do nothing with Chapman unless I made a clean breast
of it, so for the second time that day I told the whole story.</p>

<p>I couldn't have wished for a better audience.  He got wildly
excited before I was half through with it.  No doubt of the correctness
of my evidence ever entered his head, for, like most of his party,
he hated anarchism worse than capitalism, and the notion of a
highly capitalised, highly scientific, highly undemocratic anarchism
fairly revolted his soul.  Besides, he adored Tommy Deloraine. 
Routh, he told me, had been a young engineer of a superior type,
with a job in a big shop at Sheffield.  He had professed advanced
political views, and, although he had strictly no business to
be there, had taken a large part in Trade Union work, and was
treasurer of one big branch. Chapman had met him often at conferences
and on platforms, and had been impressed by the fertility and
ingenuity of his mind and the boldness of his purpose.  He was
the leader of the left wing of the movement, and had that gift
of half-scientific, half-philosophic jargon which is dear at all
times to the hearts of the half-baked.  A seat in Parliament had
been repeatedly offered him, but he had always declined; wisely,
Chapman thought, for he judged him the type which is more effective
behind the scenes.</p>

<p>But with all his ability he had not been popular.  "He was a
cold-blooded, sneering devil," as Chapman put it, "a sort of Parnell.
He tyrannised over his followers, and he was the rudest brute
I ever met."</p>

<p>Then followed the catastrophe, in which it became apparent that
he had speculated with the funds of his Union and had lost a large
sum. Chapman, however, was suspicious of these losses, and was
inclined to suspect that he had the money all the time in a safe
place.  A year or two earlier the Unions, greatly to the disgust
of old-fashioned folk, had been given certain extra-legal privileges,
and this man Routh had been one of the chief advocates of the
Unions' claims.  Now he had the cool effrontery to turn the tables
on them and use those very privileges to justify his action and
escape prosecution.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done.  Some of the fellows, said Chapman,
swore to wring his neck, but he did not give them the chance. 
He had disappeared from England, and was generally believed to
be living in some foreign capital.</p>

<p>"What I would give to be even with the swine!" cried my friend,
clenching and unclenching his big fist.  "But we're up against
no small thing in Josiah Routh.  There isn't a crime on earth
he'd stick at, and he's as clever as the old Devil, his master."</p>

<p>"If that's how you feel, I can trust you to back me up," I said.
"And the first thing I want you to do is to come and stay at my
flat. God knows what may happen next, and two men are better than
one.  I tell you frankly, I'm nervous, and I would like to have
you with me."</p>

<p>Chapman had no objection.  I accompanied him to his Bloomsbury
lodgings, where he packed a bag, and we returned to the Down Street
flat.  The sight of his burly figure and sagacious face was a
relief to me in the mysterious darkness where I now found myself
walking.</p>

<p>Thus begun my housekeeping with Chapman&mdash;one of the queerest
episodes in my life.  He was the best fellow in the world, but
I found that I had misjudged his character.  To see him in the
House, you would have thought him a piece of granite, with his
Yorkshire bluntness and hard, downright, north-country sense. 
He had all that somewhere inside him, but he was also as romantic
as a boy.  The new situation delighted him.  He was quite clear
that it was another case of the strife between Capital and Labour
&mdash;Tommy and I standing for Labour, though he used to refer
to Tommy in public as a "gilded popinjay," and only a month before
had described me in the House as a "viperous lackey of Capitalism." 
It was the best kind of strife, in which you had not to meet your
adversary with long-winded speeches but might any moment get a
chance to pummel him with your fists.</p>

<p>He made me ache with laughter.  The spying business used to rouse
him to fury.  I don't think he was tracked as I was, but he chose
to fancy he was, and was guilty of assault and battery on one
butcher's boy, two cabbies, and a gentleman who turned out to
be a bookmaker's assistant.  This side of him got to be an infernal
nuisance, and I had many rows with him.  Among other things, he
chose to suspect my man Waters of treachery &mdash;Waters, who
was the son of a gardener at home, and hadn't wits enough to put
up an umbrella when it rained.</p>

<p>"You're not taking this business rightly," he maintained one
night. "What's the good of waiting for these devils to down you? 
Let's go out and down them."  And he announced his intention,
from which no words of mine could dissuade him, of keeping watch
on Mr. Andrew Lumley at the Albany.</p>

<p>His resolution led to a complete disregard of his Parliamentary
duties.  Deputations of constituents waited for him in vain. 
Of course he never got a sight of Lumley.  All that happened was
that he was very nearly given in charge more than once for molesting
peaceable citizens in the neighbourhood of Piccadilly and Regent
Street.</p>

<p>One night, on my way home from the Temple, I saw in the bills
of the evening papers the announcement of the arrest of a Labour
Member.  It was Chapman, sure enough.  At first, I feared that
he had got himself into serious trouble, and was much relieved
to find him in the flat in a state of blazing anger.  It seemed
that he had found somebody whom he thought was Lumley, for he
only knew him from my descriptions.  The man was in a shop in
Jermyn Street, with a car waiting outside, and Chapman had&mdash;politely,
as he swore&mdash;asked the chauffeur his master's name.  The chauffeur
had replied abusively, upon which Chapman had hauled him from
the driver's seat and shaken him till his teeth rattled.  The
owner came out, and Chapman was arrested and taken off to the
nearest police-court.  He had been compelled to apologise and
had been fined five pounds and costs.</p>

<p>By the mercy of Heaven, the chauffeur's master was a money-lender
of evil repute, so the affair did Chapman no harm.  But I was
forced to talk to him seriously.  I knew it was no use explaining
that for him to spy on the Power-House was like an elephant stalking
a gazelle. The only way was to appeal to his incurable romanticism.</p>

<p>"Don't you see," I told him, "that you are playing Lumley's game? 
He will trap you sooner or later into some escapade which will
land you in jail, and where will I be then?  That is what he and
his friends are out for.  We have got to meet cunning with cunning,
and lie low till we get our chance."</p>

<p>He allowed himself to be convinced, and handed over to me the
pistol he had bought, which had been the terror of my life.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, "I'll keep quiet.  But you promise to let
me into the big scrap when it comes off."</p>

<p>I promised.  Chapman's notion of the grand finale was a Homeric
combat in which he would get his fill of fisticuffs.</p>

<p>He was an anxiety, but all the same he was an enormous comfort. 
His imperturbable cheerfulness and his racy talk were the tonics
I wanted.  He had plenty of wisdom, too.  My nerves were getting
bad those days, and, whereas I had rarely touched the things before,
I now found myself smoking cigarettes from morning till night. 
I am pretty abstemious, as you know, but I discovered, to my horror,
that I was drinking far too many whiskeys-and-sodas.  Chapman
knocked me off all that and got me back to a pipe and a modest
nightcap.</p>

<p>He did more, for he undertook to put me in training.  His notion
was that we should win in the end by superior muscles.  He was
a square, thick-set fellow, who had been a good middle-weight
boxer.  I could box a bit myself, but I improved mightily under
his tuition.  We got some gloves, and used to hammer each other
for half an hour every morning.  Then might have been seen the
shameful spectacle of a rising barrister with a swollen lip and
a black eye arguing in court, and proceeding of an evening to
his country's legislature, where he was confronted from the opposite
benches by the sight of a Leader of the People in the same vulgar
condition.</p>

<p>In those days I wanted all the relief I could get, for it was
a beastly time.  I knew I was in grave danger, so I made my will
and went through the other doleful performances consequent on
the expectation of a speedy decease.  You see, I had nothing to
grip on, no clear job to tackle, only to wait on the off-chance,
with an atmosphere of suspicion thickening around me.  The spying
went on&mdash;there was no mistake about that&mdash;but I soon ceased to
mind it, though I did my best to give my watchers little satisfaction. 
There was a hint of bullying about the spying.  It is disconcerting
at night to have a man bump against you and look you greedily
in the face.</p>

<p>I did not go again to Scotland Yard, but one night I ran across
Macgillivray in the club.</p>

<p>He had something of profound interest to tell me.  I had asked
about the phrase, the "Power-House."  Well, he had come across
it in the letter of a German friend, a private letter, in which
the writer gave the results of his inquiries into a curious affair
which a year before had excited Europe.</p>

<p>I have forgotten the details, but it had something to do with
the Slav States of Austria and an Italian Students' Union, and
it threatened at one time to be dangerous.  Macgillivray's correspondent
said that in some documents which were seized he found constant
allusion to a thing called the <em>Krafthaus</em>, evidently the
headquarters-staff of the plot.  And this same word, <em>Krafthaus</em>,
had appeared elsewhere&mdash;in a sonnet of a poet-anarchist who shot
himself in the slums of Antwerp, in the last ravings of more than
one criminal, in the extraordinary testament of Professor <em>M&#11834;,
</em>of Jena, who, at the age of thirty-seven, took his life after
writing a strange, mystical message to his fellow citizens.</p>

<p>Macgillivray's correspondent concluded by saying that, in his
opinion, if this <em>Krafthaus</em> could be found, the key would
be discovered to the most dangerous secret organisation in the
world. He added that he had some reason to believe that the motive
power of the concern was English.</p>

<p>"Macgillivray," I said, "you have known me for some time, and
I fancy you think me a sober and discreet person.  Well, I believe
I am on the edge of discovering the secret of your <em>Krafthaus</em>. 
I want you to promise me that if in the next week I send you an
urgent message you will act on it, however fantastic it seems. 
I can't tell you more.  I ask you to take me on trust, and believe
that for anything I do I have tremendous reasons."</p>

<p>He knit his shaggy grey eyebrows and looked curiously at me. 
"Yes, I'll go bail for your sanity.  It's a good deal to promise,
but if you make an appeal to me I will see that it is met."</p>

<p>Next day I had news from Felix.  Tuke and the man called Saronov
had been identified.  If you are making inquiries about anybody
it is fairly easy to find those who are seeking for the same person,
and the Russian police, in tracking Tommy and Pitt-Heron, had
easily come on the two gentlemen who were following the same trail. 
The two had gone by Samarkand, evidently intending to strike into
the hills by a shorter route than the main road from Bokhara. 
The frontier posts had been warned, and the stalkers had become
the stalked.</p>

<p>That was one solid achievement, at any rate.  I had saved Pitt-Heron
from the worst danger, for first I had sent him Tommy, and now
I had put the police on guard against his enemies.  I had not
the slightest doubt that enemies they were.  Charles knew too
much, and Tuke was the man appointed to reason with him, to bring
him back, if possible; or, if not&#11834;  As Chapman had said, the
ex-Union leader was not the man to stick at trifles.</p>

<p>It was a broiling June, the London season was at its height,
and I had never been so busy in the Courts before.  But that crowded
and garish world was little more than a dream to me.  I went through
my daily tasks, dined out, went to the play, had consultations,
talked to my fellows, but all the while I had the feeling that
I was watching somebody else perform the same functions.  I believe
I did my work well, and I know I was twice complimented by the
Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>But my real interests were far away.  Always I saw two men in
the hot glens of the Oxus, with the fine dust of the <em>loess</em>
rising in yellow clouds behind them.  One of these men had a drawn
and anxious face, and both rode hard.  They passed by the closes
of apricot and cherry and the green, watered gardens, and soon
the Oxus ceased to flow wide among rushes and water-lilies and
became a turbid hill-stream. By-and-by the roadside changed, and
the horses of the travellers trod on mountain turf, crushing the
irises and marigolds and thyme.  I could feel the free air blowing
from the roof of the world, and see far ahead the snowy saddle
of the pass which led to India.</p>

<p>Far behind the riders I saw two others, and they chose a different
way, now over waterless plateaux, now in rugged <em>nullahs</em>. 
They rode the faster and their route was the shorter.  Sooner
or later they must catch up the first riders, and I knew, though
how I could not tell, that death would attend the meeting.</p>

<p>I, and only I, sitting in London, four thousand miles away, could
prevent disaster.  The dream haunted me at night, and often, walking
in the Strand or sitting at a dinner-table, I have found my eyes
fixed clearly on the shining upland with the thin white mountains
at the back of it, and the four dots, which were men, hurrying
fast on their business.</p>

<p>One night I met Lumley.  It was at a big political dinner given
by the chief of my party in the House of Lords&mdash;fifty or sixty
guests, and a blaze of stars and decorations.  I sat near the
bottom of the table, and he was near the top, sitting between
a famous General and an ex-Viceroy of India.  I asked my right-hand
neighbour who he was, but he could not tell me.  The same question
to my left-hand neighbour brought an answer:</p>

<p>"It is old Lumley.  Have you never met him?  He doesn't go out
much, but he gives a man's dinner now and then which are the best
in London.  No.  He's not a politician, though he favours our
side, and I expect has given a lot to our funds.  I can't think
why they don't make him a Peer.  He's enormously rich and very
generous, and the most learned old fellow in Britain.  My Chief"&mdash;my
neighbour was an Under-Secretary&mdash;"knows him, and told me once
that if you wanted any out-of-the-way bit of knowledge you could
get it by asking Lumley.  I expect he pulls the strings more than
anybody living.  But he scarcely ever goes out, and it's a feather
in our host's cap to have got him to-night.  You never see his
name in the papers, either.  He probably pays the Press to keep
him out, like some of those millionaire fellows in America."</p>

<p>I watched him through dinner.  He was the centre of the talk
at his end of the table.  I could see the blue ribbon bulging
out on Lord Morecambe's breast as he leaned forward to question
him.  He was wearing some foreign orders, including the Legion
of Honour, and I could hear in the pause of conversation echoes
of his soft, rich voice.  I could see him beaming through his
glasses on his neighbours, and now and then he would take them
off and look mildly at a speaker.  I wondered why nobody realised,
as I did, what was in his light wild eyes.</p>

<p>The dinner, I believe, was excellent and the company was good,
but down at my end I could eat little, and I did not want to talk. 
Here in this pleasant room, with servants moving softly about
and a mellow light on the silver from the shaded candles, I felt
the man was buttressed and defended beyond my reach.  A kind of
despairing hatred gripped me when I looked his way.  For I was
always conscious of that other picture&mdash;the Asian desert, Pitt-Heron's
hunted face, and the grim figure of Tuke on his trail.  That,
and the great secret wheels of what was too inhuman to be called
crime moving throughout the globe under this man's hand.</p>

<p>There was a party afterwards, but I did not stay.  No more did
Lumley, and for a second I brushed against him in the hall at
the foot of the big staircase.</p>

<p>He smiled on me affectionately.</p>

<p>"Have you been dining here?  I did not notice you."</p>

<p>"You had better things to think of," I said.  "By the way, you
gave me good advice some weeks ago.  It may interest you to hear
that I have taken it."</p>

<p>"I am so glad," he said softly.  "You are a very discreet young
man."</p>

<p>But his eyes told me that he knew I lied.</p>
