<p>Sweetly the Sabbath bells sounded in the ear of Blair Robertson.
What a joy it was to be once more at home, once more in his native
land. How delightful the thought that prayer had already gone
up from many family altars, and already Christ's little ones were
gathering to be taught of him and sing his praise. To dwell among
the ungodly is indeed a bitter trial. The society of the unprincipled
had been to Blair like a dark cloud overshadowing his pathway;
and it was a new delight to him to be once more among the people
of God. What a blessing it seemed to him to be a dweller in the
land of light and liberty, where the free worshippers might pray
and praise without let or hinderance from ungodly men.</p>

<p>Full of such glad thoughts, he walked towards the church so endeared
to him by many hallowed associations. His mother was at his side,
and his kind townsmen on every hand were giving him their cordial
greeting, while the little children looked at him with curious
wonder, as the brave boy whom even their fathers "delighted to
honor."</p>

<p>Once in the house of God, all other thoughts were hushed in the
mind of Blair, by the remembrance of the presence into which he
was now ushered. It was a joy to him to join in heartfelt prayer,
and praise with so many true children of God, and to stand among
his brethren who like him could say from the heart, "I believe
in the Lord Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>A deep, strong voice near him made the young worshipper aware
of the presence of Derry Duck in the solemn assembly, joining
with his whole heart in the hymn of praise. Ah, men might heap
honor upon the young patriot, and applaud his courage in the hour
of danger, and welcome was their cordial tribute; but their loudest
acclamations had not power to wake in the soul of Blair Robertson
such deep, grateful joy as the sight of that ransomed sailor,
brought home to the Father's house.</p>

<p>Every word of the service had its meaning to Derry Duck. He confessed
anew the sins of his burdened heart, and accepted once more the
free forgiveness found in Christ Jesus. He called on God as his
Father, and seemed to be professing before men and angels the
faith for which he was willing to die.</p>

<p>The clergyman gave forth the simple notice, "A person desires
to return thanks for a safe return from sea." All eyes were suddenly
bent upon Blair with loving pride. Very deep and true was the
thanksgiving of the Fairport congregation for the return of their
brave deliverer; but who shall tell what passed in the mother's
heart, or in that of her rejoicing son?</p>
