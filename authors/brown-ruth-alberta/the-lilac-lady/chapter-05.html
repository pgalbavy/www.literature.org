<p>Having a naturally light-hearted, merry disposition, Peace did
not find it hard work to "smile and talk," but it was hard, very
hard, to restrain her generous impulses to give away everything
she possessed to those less fortunate than herself, and it soon
became a familiar sight to see her fly excitedly into the house
straight to the study where the busy President spent many hours
each day, exclaiming breathlessly as she ran, "Oh, grandpa, there
is a little beggar at the door in perfect rags and tatters! Just
come and look if she doesn't need some clothes. And she is so
cold and pinched up with being empty. Gussie has fed her, but
can't I give her some things to wear? I've more than I need, truly!"</p>

<p>Then the good man with a patient sigh would leave his work to
investigate the case, spending many minutes of his precious time
in satisfying himself as to whether or not Peace's newly found
beggar was genuine and really in need of relief,&mdash;for this small
maid's thirst for discovering vagabonds seemed insatiable, and
the string of tramps which haunted the President's doorstep led
poor Gussie a strenuous life for a time. But relief came from
an unexpected source at length.</p>

<p>Late one dull spring afternoon, as Gail sat with her chum, Frances
Sherrar, in the cosy window-seat of the reception-hall, studying
the next day's Latin lesson, a shadow fell across the page. Looking
up in surprise, for neither girl had heard the sound of approaching
footsteps, they beheld on the piazza the bent, shriveled, ragged
form of what appeared to be a tiny, deformed, old woman. An ancient,
faded shawl, patched and darned until it had almost lost its identity,
enveloped her from head to foot, and she looked more like an Indian
squaw than like a civilized white being. Her head and hands shook
ceaselessly as with the palsy, and the way she tottered about
made one fearful every minute last she fall.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Gail in quick sympathy, "what a feeble old creature!
It is a shame she has to beg her living. Where is my purse?"</p>

<p>"Are you going to give her money?" asked Frances in surprise.</p>

<p>"Doesn't she look as if she needed it?"</p>

<p>"She is a fake. I've seen her ever since I can remember&mdash;always
just like this. She wouldn't dare beg in town, but we are so far
out&mdash;well, if you are really determined to do it, here's a quarter."</p>

<p>Gail took the proffered coin, added a shining dollar to it, and
stepping to the door where the palsied beggar stood mumbling and
whining a pitiful hard luck tale, she pressed the silver into
the leathery, claw-like hand, smiled a sympathetic smile and bade
the old woman a God-speed.</p>

<p>Frances stayed for dinner that evening, and as the family gathered
around the table for this, the merriest hour of the whole day,
the President suddenly clapped his hand against his pockets, searched
rapidly through them, and finally brought forth a crumpled sheet
of paper, daubed with many ink blots and tipsy hieroglyphics,
which read, "No more beggars, tramps and vagabuns allowed on these
promises. We have already given away enuf to keep a army. There
are two dogs and two men in this family&mdash;so bewair!"</p>

<p>Even the presence of Peace, the author, did not prevent an explosion
of delighted shrieks from the little company, but the child merely
fixed her brown eyes, somber with reproof, upon the perfectly
grave face of the Doctor of Laws, and demanded, "Now, grandpa,
what made you take it down?"</p>

<p>"I didn't, child," he defended. "It had blown down, I think,
and lodged about the door-knob. I thought it was a hand-bill,
and rescued it as I came in."</p>

<p>"Where had you put it?" asked Cherry, grinning superciliously
at the distorted characters on the soiled paper.</p>

<p>"On the side of the house by the front door," she confessed.
"That's where I put that one."</p>

<p>"That one! Are there more?" laughed Frances, whose affection
for this original bit of femininity had only increased with the
months of their acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Of course! There had to be one for each door, 'cause the beggars
don't all go the back way, and to be sure everyone saw the tag,
I stuck one on the corner of the barn nearest the road, and another
on each gate. That surely ought' to be enough, oughtn't it?"</p>

<p>"I should think so," Mrs. Campbell agreed, making a wry face
at thought of the queer-looking signs scattered so liberally about
the property "How did you come to make them?"</p>

<p>"'Cause of that beggar at the front door this afternoon," Allee
volunteered unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"What beggar?" asked the President with interest, while Gail
and Frances exchanged knowing glances.</p>

<p>"A teenty, crooked, old woman came to the house while grandma
was out this afternoon," Peace began. "She looked as if she might
be a witch or old Grandmother, Tipsy-toe &mdash;I never did like
that game&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We thought she <em>was</em> a witch," again Allee spoke up,
unmindful of the frown on her older sister's face; "and we hid."</p>

<p>"But we watched her," Peace continued hastily, "and saw Gail
give her some money. She did look awful forlorny and squizzled
up as if she never had enough to eat to make any meat on her bones,
and she nearly tumbled over, trying to kiss Gail's hand 'cause
she gave her some money. So after she was gone, we ran down to
the gate to watch her, and what do you think? Just as she turned
the corner, there was a cop&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A what, Peace?"</p>

<p>"I mean a p'liceman, coming along with his club swinging around
his hand, and when the beggar woman saw him, she straightened
up as stiff and starchy as anybody could be, and hustled off down
the street 'most as quick as I can walk. She was a&mdash;a fraud, and
Gail got cheated just like I did when I gave that hole-y shoed
girl on the hill my shoes." Here Frances shot a look of triumph
at discomfited Gail. "So I made up my mind that grandpa is right&mdash;they
are all frauds."</p>

<p>"Why, Peace, child, I never said that in the world," the President
disclaimed, surprised out of his usual serenity by her words.</p>

<p>"That's so,&mdash;you said only half were frauds. Well, I guess it's
the fraud half that come here to beg of us. Gussie is tired of
feeding them, Jud's getting ugly, and if they keep on coming I'm
'fraid they'll really eat grandpa out of house and home. Jud says
they will. There were seven tramps last week, and already we have
had two this week, and one beggar. So I made these signs and stuck
them up where everybody'd see them and know they meant business,
w'thout Jud's having to turn the dogs loose or get his shotgun
like he said he ought to. He told me that all hoboes have some
way of letting other hoboes know where they can get a square meal,
and that's why we have so many. He says they never used to bother
so until I came here to tow them along by coaxing Gussie to feed
'em. I thought I was being good to 'em. S'posing we had sent grandpa
away when he came tramping around to our house in Parker &mdash;Faith
wanted to&mdash;where would we be now? Still grubbing in Parker trying
to get enough to eat, 'most likely; or maybe in the poorhouse,
for 'twas grandpa who paid the mortgage on the farm. I guess I
must wait till I'm grown way up to have any missionary sense."</p>

<p>She spoke so dejectedly and her face looked so pathetic and utterly
discouraged that no one had the heart to laugh, but a sudden feeling
of restraint fell upon the group. Even the President had no words
in which to answer the poor, disheartened little missionary.</p>

<p>"Do you belong to Miss Smiley's Gleaners?" It was Frances who
spoke, and though the words themselves signified little, her tone
of voice was like an electric thrill, and the faces of the whole
company turned expectantly toward her as she waited for Peace's
answer.</p>

<p>"No, not yet. Evelyn has been after us ever since we came here
to join them, but something has always kept us away from the meetings
each month, so we haven't been 'lected yet. Evelyn says they don't
do much but have a good time, anyway, though it is a missionary
society. That's about all our Sunshine Club in Parker ever did,
too, 'xcept make comfort powders for the sick and <em>mained</em>
in the hospital."</p>

<p>"Evelyn is right about what the Gleaners used to be, but since
her aunt has taken up the work, they are doing lots of real missionary
work. Why, since Christmas they have raised enough money to take
care of two orphans in India for a year. Edith Smiley is such
a beautiful girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ain't she, though!" Peace burst out with customary impetuosity.
"I've wanted her for my Sunday School teacher ever since we began
to go to South Avenue Church, but she's got a class of <em>boys</em>."</p>

<p>"And don't they adore her!"</p>

<p>"No more'n I would."</p>

<p>"It is easier to get teachers for girls' classes; and besides,
Miss Edith has had these boys from the time she started to teach.
She certainly has her hands full with her Sunday School class,
the Gleaners Missionary Band and the Young People's Society, for
she is our president this term. There is no lag about her. She
is always planning something beautiful for somebody. <em>Everyone</em>
loves her. When Victor was in the hospital the time he was hurt
by the runaway, Miss Edith took him flowers several times; and
the nurse told us that she visits the children's ward twice a
month regularly and takes them fruit or flowers or scrap-books
or something nice. They always know when to expect her, and she
never disappoints them."</p>

<p>"She certainly knows how to make sunshine for those around her,"
said Mrs. Campbell warmly. "I am so pleased to think she could
take charge of the Gleaners. We ladies were really afraid the
society must die. Miss Hilliker had neither strength, time nor
talent to do justice to the work; but, poor soul, she did try
so hard, and she did give the children a good time, whether or
not they ever accomplished anything else."</p>

<p>"I am glad Miss Smiley has taken the Gleaners, too," said Peace
meditatively. "Me and Allee 'xpect to join at next meeting. I
guess maybe Cherry and Hope will, too, though I haven't asked
them yet."</p>

<p>"I think you have headed them in the right direction, Frances,"
whispered the President in grateful tones, when at last the dinner
was ended and the chattering group were filing out of the dining-room.
"I was beginning to wonder what in the world to do with our little
Peace, but I think perhaps Miss Smiley will help solve the problem
for us."</p>

<p>"I know she will," Frances replied confidently. "I can understand
how discouraged poor Peace must feel. I've been there myself,
only instead of giving away my own things as she does, I gave
away other people's belongings. I can never forget the seance
I had with mother the day I handed over father's best, go-to-meeting
overcoat to a dirty, evil-looking tramp, and gave away Victor's
velocipede to the ash-man's little boy. I came to the conclusion
that the whole world was just a sham and all men&mdash;yes, and women&mdash;were
liars. Mrs. Smiley came to my rescue, and what missionary spirit
there is left in me is due to her good work and untiring efforts.
Edith is a second edition of her mother."</p>

<p>"And I think Frances must be second cousin at heart," said the
Doctor, gently pressing her hand.</p>

<p>"I don't deserve such praise," she protested, blushing with pleasure
at his compliment. "I have only tried to make the most of the
best in me, remembering the little verse we had for a motto:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'No robin but may thrill some heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His dawnlight gladness voicing.<br/>
God gives us all some small sweet way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To set the world rejoicing.'

</p>
</div>
<p>"We were only children when we took that as our class motto,
but we have kept it all these years, and I know there is not one
of the girls who considers it childish sentiment even yet."</p>

<p>"That is why I am particularly thankful for your words at the
table tonight. I want my girls to meet and mingle with and be
influenced by such people as Miss Edith and her mother&mdash;and Miss
Frances!"</p>

<p>"I shall work hard to keep the reputation you have given me,"
she laughed gayly, flitting away to join Gail in the Grove, as
the pink and green and brown room was called; but she was secretly
much touched and helped by the President's words, and rejoiced
openly when a few days later the four younger Greenfield girls
really did join the Gleaners Missionary Band and became active
workers in that field.</p>

<p>"It is kind of a queer missionary society," Peace reported after
one of the meetings. "Sometimes we don't say hardly a word about
heathen or poor ministers on the frontier all the time we are
at the church. We talk about how we can help each other and our
families and folks who live close by us. Miss Edith says first
and foremost a good missionary must be cheerful and sunshiny.
Our motto is "Scatter Sunshine," and our song is the prettiest
music I ever heard. She says it isn't the music that counts, it's
the words, but just s'posing we sang:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'In a world where sorrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever will be known,<br/>
Where are found the needy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sad and lone;<br/>
How much joy and comfort<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can all bestow,<br/>
If you scatter sunshine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere you go.'

</p>
</div>
<p>to the tune of 'Go tell Aunt Rhody,' it wouldn't cheer <em>me</em>
up very much. "Would it you?"</p>

<p>"No," laughed Mrs. Campbell, who chanced to be her confidante
on this particular occasion, "I don't think it would; but on the
other hand, meaningless words would not cheer anyone, either,
no matter how pretty the tune. Is that not so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I s'pose it is. I guess it takes both together to do the
work. This week our verse is:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'Can I help another<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By some word or deed?<br/>
Can I scatter blessings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er a soul's sore need?<br/>
If I can, then let me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, within today,<br/>
Help the one who needs me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On a little way.'

</p>
</div>
<p>"The next time we tell if we remembered the verse and worked
it."</p>

<p>"Worked it?" Mrs. Campbell was not yet accustomed to Peace's
queer speeches, and often did not understand her meaning.</p>

<p>"Yes. Miss Edith says just helping Gussie carry the dishes away
nights, or buttoning Marie's dress when she is cross and in a
hurry, or getting grandpa's slippers ready for him when he comes
home from the University all cold and tired, or holding that squirmy
yarn for you when you knit those ugly shawls, or talking nice
to Jud when he makes me mad, is being a missionary. She says it
is the little, everyday things that count; for some of us may
never get a chance to do anything real big and splendid, and if
we wait all our lives for such a time to come along, we will be
just wasting our talents. But all of us have hundreds of little
things each day to do, and if we do them cheerfully and sweetly,
we are being sunshine missionaries and are making others happier
all the time. She says Abr'am Lincoln's greatest wish was to have
it said of him when he died that he had always tried to pull up
a thistle and plant a flower wherever he got a chance. Thistles
mean hard feelings and mean acts, and the flowers are kind words
and deeds."</p>

<p>"Miss Edith has found the key to true happiness," murmured Mrs.
Campbell, glancing out of the window at a tall, slender, gray-eyed
young lady hurrying down the street, surrounded by a bevy of bright-faced,
adoring boys and girls.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's another Saint Elspeth, isn't she? How nice it is
to have her here as long as I can't have my dear Mrs. Strong!
And do you know, grandma, she and Mrs. Strong were chums when
they went to college? Isn't that queer?"</p>

<p>"How did you happen to find that out?"</p>

<p>"'Cause on my list of missionary doings this week I had 'not
getting mad when Gray chawed up St. Elspeth's letter 'fore I had
read it more'n three times.' And she asked me who Saint Elspeth
was."</p>

<p>"Do you make out a list of missionary doings each week?" asked
Mrs. Campbell, amused at Peace's version of the occurrence, for
the child had been so angry at the destruction of the letter from
this beloved friend that she had seized a heavy club and rushed
at the cowering pup as if bent on crushing its skull. Before the
blow descended, however, she dropped her weapon, bounced into
a nearby chair, and glared wrathfully at poor Gray until he shrank
from her almost as if she had struck him. Then suddenly the anger
died from her eyes, and clutching the surprised animal about the
neck she fell to petting him energetically, exclaiming in pitying
tones, "Poor Gray, I don't s'pose you know how near I came to
knocking your head off any more'n you know how much I wanted that
letter you've just swallowed, but I'm sorry just the same. Shake
hands and be friends!"</p>

<p>Peace, not understanding the smile that crept over the gentle
face of the dear old lady, hastened to explain, "We write them
so's folks won't laugh. We don't mean to laugh at each other,
but sometimes children do say the funniest things. There is Bernice
Platte for one. She can't say anything the way she wants to, and
it makes her feel bad when we giggle. So Miss Edith took to having
us write our lists. I don't care how much they laugh at me, I
get so much of that at home that I am used to it, but some folks
ain't brought up that way and I s'pose it hurts."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell caught her breath sharply. It had never occurred
to her before that Peace was sensitive, but the gusty sigh with
which these words were spoken told her companion much, and slipping
her arm about the little figure crouched at her side, the woman
said gently, "Would you mind telling grandma some of the bits
of sunshine you have been scattering this week?"</p>

<p>The wistful round face brightened quickly. "Would you care to
hear?"</p>

<p>"I should love to, dearie."</p>

<p>"I didn't <em>make</em> much sunshine, I guess, 'nless 'twas
here at home where folks know me, but I tried. You know Hope has
been taking flowers to one of her teachers at High School, and
the other day Miss Pope told her that she gave them all to her
brother who is lame and can't walk, and he spends all his days
drawing and painting the pretty things he sees. Well, there is
a teacher in our school who looks awful turned-down at the mouth,
and kind of sour like, and last week Minnie Herbert told me that
it was 'cause the woman had lost her brother in a wreck. So I
thought maybe she'd like some flowers, and I took her some. I
didn't know her name, but she was sitting in the hall to keep
order during recess time, and I carried the bouquet right up to
her and laid them in her lap. I 'xpected to see her smile, but
instead, she picked them up and looked kind of red as she asked
me what made me bring them to her. I meant to tell her I was sorry
she looked so lonely and sad, but what I really said was 'homely
and bad.' I don't see why it is I always twist things up so, but
that made her mad and I couldn't explain it so's she would take
the flowers again, and I had to give them to one of the girls
whose mother has <em>delirious tremors</em>."</p>

<p>"Oh, Peace, you have made a mistake."</p>

<p>"What is it, then?"</p>

<p>"I presume the poor woman is delirious with a fever of some sort."</p>

<p>"<em>Tryfoid</em>," supplied Peace. "Stella told teacher so.
That same day on my way home from school I saw a little girl lugging
a heavy pail, and the handle kept cutting her hands, so she had
to set it down every few steps and change to the other side. When
I asked her to let me help, she gave me hold, and we carried the
bucket down the alley to a chicken-coop, where it had to be dumped,
'cause it was slops for the hens. There was a big box there to
stand on, and I lifted the pail to the top of the fence and emptied
it, but the woman which owns the chickens was right under where
the stuff fell, and she didn't like it a bit, and scolded us both
good.</p>

<p>"Then there was Birdie Holden who wanted a bite of my apple,
and when I turned it around to give her a good chance at it, she
bit straight into a worm, and said I did it on purpose, though
I never knew the worm was there any more'n she did.</p>

<p>"But the worst of all was the day teacher sent me to the office
for thumb tacks to fasten up our drawings around the room. She
told me to see how quick I could get back, but she never counted
on the principal's not being there, which she wasn't. So I had
to wait. Then all at once I saw a big sign on the wall which said
if Miss Lisk wasn't in and folks were in a hurry, to ring the
bell twice.</p>

<p>"I was in a <em>big</em> hurry for I had waited so long already
that I thought sure Miss Allen would be after me in a minute to
see if I was making the tacks; so I grabbed the cord and jerked
the bell hard twice, and then twice again, and then twice the
third time. I 'xpected she'd come a-running at that, but what
do you think, grandma? Everyone in that schoolhouse just got up
and hustled out of doors as fast as they could march. We never
used to have fire drill in Parker and I hadn't heard of such a
thing here, either, so I was dreadfully s'prised to find what
my gong-ringing had done. Maybe Miss Lisk wasn't mad for a minute,
when she saw me hanging out of the window yelling to know what
was the matter, 'cause I was in a hurry for my thumb-tacks! But
afterwards she laughed like anything and said the children made
record time in getting out, 'cause no one, not even she herself,
knew whether it was just a fire drill or whether the janitor had
rung the gong on account of the school's really being burned up."</p>

<p>No one could blame the good dame for smiling at the vivid pictures
Peace had painted of her missionary efforts, but Mrs. Campbell
knew how sore the little heart must be over these seeming failures,
so she pressed the nestling head closer to her shoulder and said
comfortingly, "But think of all the smiles you have won from the
washerwoman. When I paid her last night, she showed me the big
bunch of flowers you had cut from your hyacinths and lilies in
the conservatory, and told me how eagerly her poor, sick little
girl watched for her home-coming the days she washed here, knowing
that you would never forget to send her something. And Jud was
telling your grandpa only this morning how the ash-man's horse
always whinnies when the team stops in the alley, because you
never fail to be there with a lump of sugar or a handful of oats.
Mrs. Dodds says it is a real pleasure to make dresses for you,
just to hear you praise her work. I was in the kitchen this morning
when the grocer brought our order, and after he was gone, Gussie
showed me a sack of candy he had slipped in for you, because you
are so kind to his little girl at school. I don't need Jud's words
to tell me how the horses and other animals on the place love
you. And why? Because you love them and never hurt them."</p>

<p>"But, grandma," interrupted Peace, her eyes wide with amazement
at this recital; "you don't call those things scattering sunshine,
do you?"</p>

<p>"What would you call it, dear?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but &mdash;I didn't do those things on purpose, grandma.
They&mdash;they just did themselves. I like to see Mrs. O'Flaherty's
eyes shine and hear her say, 'May the saints in Hivin bliss ye,
darlint,' when I give her anything for Maggie; and the ash-man's
horse doesn't get enough to eat&mdash;really, it is 'most starved,
I guess; and Mrs. Dodds does look so tickled when I say anything
she makes is pretty. They <em>are</em> pretty, too. And the grocer's
little girl is so scared if anyone speaks to her that a lot of
the bigger girls got to teasing her dreadfully and I couldn't
help lighting into them and telling them they ought to be ashamed
of themselves; and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is what <em>I</em> call scattering sunshine, dear. It is
these little acts of ours which count, these acts done unconsciously,
without any thought of others seeing, done simply because our
hearts are so full of love and sympathy that they bubble over
without our knowing it, and others are made happy because of our
unselfishness."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," said Peace thoughtfully; "'cause when
folks are watching and I want to be 'specially sweet and nice
and helpful, I just make a dreadful bungle of it, and everyone
laughs. It's the things we do without thinking that make folks
happiest. That is what Saint Elspeth used to tell me. Some way
I could understand her better than Miss Edith, I guess; but maybe
it was 'cause I knew her better. When do you s'pose we can go
to see her, grandma? Saint Elspeth, I mean. It has been such a
long time since&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She wants you next week, you and Allee."</p>

<p>It was the President who spoke, and with a startled cry, Peace
leaped up to find him in the doorway behind them. "Why, Grandpa
Campbell, how did you sneak in here so softly? I never heard you
at all, you came so catty. Did you hear what we were talking about?"</p>

<p>"Not much of it. I arrived just in time to catch your remarks
about Mrs. Strong, and as I happen to have a note in my pocket
this minute from your Saint John, I spoke right out without thinking.
I was intending to make you and grandma jump a little."</p>

<p>"You made me jump a lot," she retorted, throwing her arms about
him and giving him a rapturous hug. "Did you really mean that
Mrs. Strong wants me next week? That is our spring vacation here
in Martindale."</p>

<p>"Yes, so the letter said. You see, the Strongs are living in
Martindale now, too."</p>

<p>"Grandpa! You're fooling!"</p>

<p>"Not this time. I have known for a whole month that there was
some prospect of their coming to the city, but I waited until
I was sure before saying anything, because I knew you girls would
be disappointed if they did not get the place."</p>

<p>"What place? How did it happen? What will Parker do without him?
Will he live near us? Can we see them often? Where did you get
the note?"</p>

<p>"One question at a time, please," he cried laughingly. "Mr. Strong
dropped in at the University a minute this afternoon. He has been
called to fill the vacancy at Hill Street Church, and has accepted,
but as his pastorate is about three miles from this part of the
city, he will not live very close to us. However, it will be possible
for you to see each other more frequently than if they had remained
at Parker. They moved yesterday into the new parsonage, and Mrs.
Strong wants to borrow our two youngest next week to help her
with the baby while they are getting settled. Do you want to go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can hardly wait! Can we really stay the whole week?"</p>

<p>"You ungrateful little vagabond!" he thundered in pretended anger.
"You want to leave your old grandpa for a whole week, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she giggled. "A change would do us both good. Besides,
we live with you all the time, and I don't get a chance to see
Saint Elspeth and Glen very often&mdash;but I'd lots rather have my
<em>home</em> with you, though I do like to go visiting once in
a while, same as you do."</p>

<p>"Teaser! Well, if grandma thinks it wise, you and Allee may go
next week to visit your patron saints &mdash;What is the matter,
Dora? Doesn't the plan please you?"</p>

<p>For grandma looked unusually grave and thoughtful, but at his
question she merely answered, "Peace may accept if she wishes,
but unless Allee's cold is much better by Monday, I don't think
it best for her to go. I kept her home from school today."</p>

<p>For a moment the brown-haired child stood silent and hesitating
on one foot in the middle of the floor. It would be hard to be
separated from this golden-haired sister for a whole week, but&mdash;it
had been <em>such</em> a long time since she had seen these other
precious friends; and anyway, Elspeth needed someone to help her.
Besides, Allee might be well enough to go by Monday, or perhaps
she could come later in the week. It would be wisest to accept
the invitation at once, so with a little hop of decision, she
announced serenely, "Tell Saint John I'll come, and prob'ly Allee
will, too. Her colds don't usu'ly last long, and she'll be all
right by Monday."</p>
