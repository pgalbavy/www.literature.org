<p>Nicholas Ribsam proceeded to show Master Herbert Watrous what
he meant to do about it.</p>

<p>Paying no heed to the formidable attitude of the city youth,
Nick rushed straight upon him, and embracing him about the waist
so as to pinion his arms, he threw him flat upon the ground with
great emphasis. Then, while Herbert lay on his face, vainly struggling
to rise, Nick sat down heavily on his back. Although he could
have used his fists with great effect, Nick declined to do so;
but, rising some six or eight inches, he sat down on him again,
and then repeated the performance very fast, bounding up and down
as a man is sometimes seen to do when a horse is trotting; descending
each time on the back of Herbert with such vigor that the breath
was almost forced from his body.</p>

<p>"Let me up!" shouted the victim, in a jerky, spasmodic manner,
as the words were helped out; "that ain't the right way to fight:
that isn't fair."</p>

<p>"It suits me better as nefer vas," replied the grinning Nick,
banging himself down on the back of the struggling Herbert, until
the latter began to cry and ask the boys to pull Nick off.</p>

<p>No one interfered, however, and when the conqueror thought he
had flattened out the city youth to that extent that he would
never acquire any plumpness again, he rose from his seat and allowed
Herbert to climb upon his feet.</p>

<p>Never was a boy more completely cowed than was this vaunting
youth, on whom all the others had looked with such admiration
and awe. He meekly picked up his hat, brushed off the dirt, and
looking reproachfully at Nick said:</p>

<p>"Do you know you broke two of my ribs?"</p>

<p>"I dinks I brokes dem <em>all</em>: dat's what I meant to do;
I will try him agin."</p>

<p>"No, you won't!" exclaimed Herbert, darting off in a run too
rapid for the short legs of Nick to equal.</p>

<p>Nick Ribsam had conquered a peace, and from that time forth he
suffered no persecution at school. Master Herbert soon after went
back to his city home, wondering how it was that a small, dumpy
lad, four years younger than he, was able to vanquish him so completely
when all the science was on the side of the elder youth.</p>

<p>Young as was Nick Ribsam, there was not a boy in the school who
dared attempt to play the bully over him. The display he had given
of his prowess won the respect of all.</p>

<p>Besides this he proved to be an unusually bright scholar. He
dropped his faulty accent with astonishing rapidity, and gained
knowledge with great facility. His teacher liked him, as did all
the boys and girls, and when he was occasionally absent he was
missed more than half a dozen other lads would have been.</p>

<p>The next year Nick brought his sister Nellie to school. He came
down the road, holding her fat little hand in his, while her bright
eyes peered out from under her plain but odd-looking hat in a
timid way, which showed at the same time how great her confidence
was in her big brother.</p>

<p>Nellie looked as much like Nick as a sister can look like a brother.
There were the same ruddy cheeks, bright eyes, sturdy health,
and cleanly appearance. Her gingham pantalettes came a little
nearer the tops of her shoes, perhaps than was necessary, but
the dress, with the waist directly under the arms, would have
been considered in the height of fashion in late years.</p>

<p>One daring lad ventured to laugh at Nellie, and ask her whether
she had on her father's or mother's shoes, but when Nick heard
of it he told the boy that he would "sit down" on any one that
said anything wrong to Nellie. Nothing of the kind was ever hinted
to the girl again. No one wished to be "sat down" on by the Pennsylvania
Hollander who banged the breath so utterly from the body of the
city youth who had aroused his wrath.</p>

<p>The common sense, sturdy frame, sound health, and mental strength
of the parents were inherited in as marked a degree by the daughter
Nellie as by Nick. She showed a quickness of perception greater
than that of her brother; but, as is generally the case, the boy
was more profound and far-reaching in his thoughts.</p>

<p>After Nick had done his chores in the evening and Nellie was
through helping her mother, Gustav, the father, was accustomed
to light his long-handled pipe, and, as he slowly puffed it while
sitting in his chair by the hearth, he looked across to his boy,
who sat with his slate and pencil in hand, preparing for the morrow.
Carefully watching the studious lad for a few minutes, he generally
asked a series of questions:</p>

<p>"Nicholas, did you knowed your lessons to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you know efery one dot you knowed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir,&mdash;every one," answered Nick respectfully, with a quiet
smile over his father's odd questions and sentences. The old gentleman
could never correct or improve his accent, while Nick, at the
age of ten, spoke so accurately that his looks were all that showed
he was the child of German parents.</p>

<p>"Did nopody gif you helps on der lessons?"</p>

<p>"Nobody at all."</p>

<p>"Dot is right; did you help anypodies?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir,&mdash;three or four of the girls and some of the boys asked
me to give them a lift&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gif dem <em>vat</em>?"</p>

<p>"A lift&mdash;that is, I helped them."</p>

<p>"Dot ish all right, but don't let me hears dot nopody vos efer
helping <em>you</em>; if I does&mdash;"</p>

<p>And taking his pipe from his mouth, Mr. Ribsam shook his head
in a way which threatened dreadful things.</p>

<p>Then the old gentleman would continue smoking a while longer,
and more than likely, just as Nick was in the midst of some intricate
problem, he would suddenly pronounce his name. The boy would look
up instantly, all attention.</p>

<p>"Hef you been into any fights mit nopodies to-day?"</p>

<p>"I have not, sir; I have not had any trouble like that for a
long while."</p>

<p>"Dot is right&mdash;dot is right; but, Nick, if you does get into
such bad tings as fightin', don't ax nopodies to help you; <em>takes
care mit yorself!</em>"</p>

<p>The lad modestly answered that he did not remember when he had
failed to take care of himself under such circumstances, and the
father resumed his pipe and brown study.</p>

<p>The honest German may not have been right in every point of his
creed, but in the main he was correct, his purpose being to implant
in his children a sturdy self-reliance. They could not hope to
get along at all times without leaning upon others, but that boy
who never forgets that God has given him a mind, a body, certain
faculties and infinite powers, with the intention that he should
cultivate and use them to the highest point, is the one who is
sure to win in the great battle of life.</p>

<p>Then, too, every person is liable to be overtaken by some great
emergency which calls out all the capacities of his nature, and
it is then that false teaching and training prove fatal, while
he who has learned to develop the divine capacities within him
comes off more than conqueror.</p>
