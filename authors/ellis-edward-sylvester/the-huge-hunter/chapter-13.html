<p><em>NOT </em>a second was to be lost. The next moment the boy
had run across the intervening space and pulled open the furnace
door of the steam man. He saw a few embers yet smoldering in the
bottom, enough to rekindle the wood. Dashing in a lot from the
wagon, he saw it begin blazing up. He pulled the valve wide open,
so that there might not be a moment's delay in starting, and held
the water in the boiler at a proper level. The smoke immediately
began issuing from the pipe or hat, and the hopes of the boy rose
correspondingly.</p>

<p>The great danger was that the Indians would return before he
could start. He kept glancing behind him, and it was with a heart
beating with despair that he heard several whoops, and saw at
the same instant a number of red-skins coming toward him.</p>

<p>The boy gave a jolt to the wagon, which communicated to the steam
man, and it instantly started, at quite a moderate gait, but rapidly
increased to its old-fashioned run.</p>

<p>It was just in the nick of time, for two minutes later the savages
would have been upon him. As it was, when they saw the giant moving
off they paused for a moment in amazement.</p>

<p>But their previous acquaintance with the apparatus had robbed
it of all its supernatural attributes, and their halt lasted but
a few seconds. The next moment they understood that there was
some human agency about it, and uttering their blood-curdling
yells, they started in full pursuit. But by this time the steam
gentleman was getting down to his regular pace, and was striding
over the prairie like a dromedary. For a time the Indians gained,
then the intervening distance became stationary, and then he began
pulling steadily away from them.</p>

<p>Still the savages maintained the chase until satisfied of its
hopelessness, when they gave it up and sullenly withdrew in the
direction of the mountains.</p>

<p>The young fellow, in his triumph, could not avoid rising in the
wagon, shouting and waving his hat defiantly at his baffled pursuers.
The daring act came near costing his life, for it was instantly
followed by the discharge of several guns, and the singing of
the bullets about his ears caused him to duck back into his seat
as suddenly as he had risen from it.</p>

<p>The afternoon was now quite well advanced, and besides feeling
hungry, Johnny Brainerd was anxious to get back to camp.</p>

<p>The intervening distance was rapidly passed, and the sun was
just setting as he slacked up within a short distance of Wolf
Ravine.</p>

<p>For some unaccountable reason, the nearer he approached 'camp,'
as it was called, a feeling akin to fear came over him. It was
a presentiment of coming evil, which he found it impossible either
to shake off or to define, and that was why he halted some distance
away.</p>

<p>From where he stood it was impossible to see his two friends
at work, but at that time of day he knew they were accustomed
to stop work and come out upon the prairie for the purpose of
enjoying the cool breeze of evening. At the same time, when such
constant danger threatened, they were accustomed to have one of
their number, either all or a part of the time, on the ground
above, where the approach of enemies could be detected.</p>

<p>The absence of anything like a sentinel increased the boy's apprehensions,
and when he had waited some fifteen minutes without seeing anything
of his friends he became painfully uneasy.</p>

<p>'What if they had been killed? What if they were prisoners? What
if a hundred Indians were at that moment in the possession of
Wolf Ravine?</p>

<p>Such and similar were the questions which the affrighted boy
asked himself, and which, with all his shrewdness, he was unable
to answer.</p>

<p>In the hope of attracting attention he set up a shrieking with
the whistle, which sounded so loud on the still evening air that
it must have gone miles away over the level prairie.</p>

<p>There being no response to this he kept it up for some time,
but it still failed, and all this confirmed him in the belief
that 'something was up.'</p>

<p>What that particular something was it was impossible to say,
so long as he sat in the wagon, and for five minutes he endeavored
to decide whether it was best to get out and make a reconnoissance
on his own hook or remain where, in case of danger, he could seek
safety in flight.</p>

<p>As the day wore rapidly away, and he still failed to see or hear
anything of his friends, he finally concluded to get out and make
an examination of the ravine.</p>

<p>Accordingly he sprung lightly to the ground, but had scarcely
alighted when a peculiar signal, something resembling a tremulous
whistle, reached his ear, and he instantly clambered back again,
fully satisfied that the whistle was intended as a signal, and
that it concerned him, although whether from friend or foe he
could only conjecture.</p>

<p>However, his alarm was such that he moved a hundred yards or
so further away from the ravine, where there was less likelihood
of being surprised by any sudden rush upon the part of the thieving
red-skins.</p>

<p>From this standpoint he carefully scanned what could be seen
of the ravine. It descended quite gradually from the edge of the
bank, so that he gained a partial view of the rocks and bowlders
upon the opposite side. Some of the trees growing in the narrow
valley rose to such a height that one-half or two-thirds of them
were exposed to view.</p>

<p>It was while the boy was gazing at these that he detected a peculiar
movement in one of the limbs, which instantly arrested his attention.</p>

<p>A moment showed him that the peculiar waving motion was made
by human agency, and he strained his eyes in the hope of detecting
the cause of the curious movement.</p>

<p>The gathering darkness made his vision quite uncertain; but he
either saw, or fancied he saw, a dark object among the limbs which
resembled the form of Baldy Bicknell, the trapper.</p>

<p>Johnny Brainerd would have given almost anything in the world
could he have understood what it all meant.</p>

<p>But the vary fact of these singular demonstrations was prima
facie evidence of the most unquestionable kind; and, after a moment's
consultation with himself, he began moving away, just as the sharp
crack of several rifles notified him of the fearful peril which
he had escaped. </p>
