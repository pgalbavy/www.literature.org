<p>Mike Murphy, even in the flurry of the moment, could not forget
his innate courtesy. He handed back the old hat to the puzzled
clerk and bowed.</p>

<p>"I thank ye very much for yer kindness, and now, lads, come wid
me."</p>

<p>He hurried out of the door, the two following closely.</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do?" asked Alvin.</p>

<p>"Folly the chap and finish the shindy I started wid him," replied
the Irish lad, staring in the direction taken by the couple. "Ye
can luk on and kaap back the man, so that I'll git fair play wid
the ither."</p>

<p>"You are not on the Southport road, Mike," warned Alvin, "and
you will be arrested before you can land a blow and probably locked
up."</p>

<p>"It'll be worth it," replied the other, scenting the battle like
a war horse. "Bad luck to it! where is the spalpeen?"</p>

<p>The three were looking keenly up the street, but, brief as was
the interval, the couple had vanished.</p>

<p>There are a number of lesser streets which lead inland at right
angles to the main avenue of Boothbay Harbor, and almost as many
that are mere alleys on the other side, through which one may
pass to the different wharves. It will be seen, therefore, that
there was nothing strange in the disappearance of the strangers
in whom our friends were so much interested.</p>

<p>"They can't have gone fur," exclaimed the impatient Mike, hesitating
for the moment as to what was best to do, and feeling the value
of every passing minute and fearing lest the opportunity be lost.</p>

<p>"They must have come in a boat," suggested Chester, "and have
turned down one of the by-streets to the water. But what is the
purpose of chasing them?"</p>

<p>"So we may catch 'em," was the reply of Mike, who feeling there
was a possibility that they might have turned the other way, addressed
Chester:</p>

<p>"Cross to the ither side of the main street and hurry by the
corners, looking up aich as ye do so; if they've turned that way,
they're still in sight."</p>

<p>There was sense in the plan. Chester ran across the avenue and
walked rapidly, glancing up each opening as he came to it. He
meant merely to keep the couple in sight until he could learn
something more of them. At the same time he was wise enough to
avoid drawing attention to himself. He passed well beyond the
hotel without catching sight of the man and boy and finally stopped,
convinced that it was useless to go farther.</p>

<p>Alvin Landon was of the same mind with him. As matters stood,
nothing was to be gained by accusing the youth of assault and
attempted robbery, for no proof could be brought forward. Moreover,
his companion at that time was absent, the man now with him having
been seen for the first time by Alvin and Mike a few minutes before.</p>

<p>"It will be well to learn something of the two," the Captain
thought to himself, "but it will be a mistake to make them suspect
us, as they are sure to do if they find we are dogging them. As
for Mike pitching in and starting another fight, it will be the
height of folly. I won't allow it."</p>

<p>The two were walking side by side and going so fast that several
persons looked curiously at them.</p>

<p>"Take it easy," advised Alvin.</p>

<p>"The same is what I'll do whin I comes up wid the spalpeen, that
stole me hat where I'd flung it in the road."</p>

<p>"Keep cool and if you get sight of them, don't go nearer, but
watch&#11834;"</p>

<p>"There they be now!" exclaimed Mike at the first glance down
one of the alleys on their left, and, before Alvin could check
him, he dashed off at his best speed. His progress might have
been satisfactory, but when half way down the hill some one pushed
the front of a wheelbarrow through a door and across the way.
Its appearance was so unexpected and close that Mike could not
check himself nor had he time in which to gather for the leap
that would clear it. He struck the obstacle fairly and went over,
landing on his hands and knees, while the barrow in turn toppled
upon him. The urchin who had caused the mischief turned and fled
in a panic, before the indignant Mike could chastise him.</p>

<p>Alvin rested his hand against the nearest building and laughed
until he could hardly save himself from falling. Resuming his
uncertain walk he called:</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, Mike?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied the lad, rubbing his shins and screwing up
his face with the smart of the bumps he had received; "as me second
cousin said whin he fell from the steeple, I've only broke both
legs, one arm and bent me head out of shape&mdash;nothin' worth the
mintion. I come nigh forgettin' my arrant."</p>

<p>And unmindful of the hurts, which were trifling, he dashed down
the slope, arriving a minute later at the wharf, where a dozen
men and several boys were loading or unloading craft, or boarding
or coming ashore from some boat. Although Mike would not admit
it, he had fixed his suspicion upon a man who when he turned his
face proved to be fully fifty years old, while his companion was
a lusty colored youth. He glanced here and there and at all the
craft in sight. Possibly his eyes rested upon the right one, but
he saw neither of the persons whom he sought, and faced about
as Alvin joined him.</p>

<p>"They have give us the slip&mdash;bad cess to 'em, for I make nothing
of the spalpeens among them in sight."</p>

<p>The two scanned all the craft that suggested ownership by the
strangers, but it was in vain. Then they made their way along
the wharves to where they had left the <em>Deerfoot</em>. Chester
was awaiting them and shook his head as they approached. Alvin
paid the man who had looked after the boat in his absence, and
after casting off and starting the motor, the three headed for
Christmas Cove, where the Captain said they would have dinner,
though they would arrive before the regular hour for that meal.
Progress was so easy that conversation kept up with the Captain
while he held the steering wheel.</p>

<p>"I suspect from what we saw awhile ago that the fellows whom
Mike and I met last night belong to a gang. One of them is a man
and there may be others."</p>

<p>"It is lucky the younger did not recognize either of you," said
Chester. "Do you think he would do so if you met face to face?"</p>

<p>"There is no reason why he should not, for Mike identified him
with only a passing glance. You must remember that the sky was
clear and the moon bright."</p>

<p>"It's mesilf that belaves we imprissed ourselves upon their memory,"
said Mike so gravely that the others knew he meant the words as
a jest. Alvin was silent for a moment and then turned his head,
for the wheel required little attention.</p>

<p>"Mike, you acknowledge me as Captain and that my mate must obey
orders?"</p>

<p>The remark was a question. The youth rose promptly to his feet
and touched his forefinger to the front of his cap.</p>

<p>"I await yer orders, Captain."</p>

<p>"If we meet that fellow whose name we believe to be 'Noxon' you
must not show that you have any suspicion of his identity, nor
must you make any move against him without first consulting me."</p>

<p>Mike looked at the second mate.</p>

<p>"Isn't that enough to timpt one to mootiny? I obsarve that Mr.
Noxon's right eye was of a bootiful black and blue color and the
ither should be painted to match the same. It was him that was
the thaif who stole me hat."</p>

<p>"Didn't you take <em>his</em> cap?"</p>

<p>"It was a fair prize of war&mdash;there's a moighty difference, as
the lawyer said whin he larned it was the ither man's ox that
was gored. But as I flung my tile away and he come back to git
his own, I sha'n't lay it up agin him."</p>

<p>As the <em>Deerfoot</em> sped northeast again, the sharp cutwater
splitting the wavelets to the tune of the big motor's humming,
and following the main line of the Maine coast, the boys saw the
small, low-lying Ram Island and its light on their right, with
Linekin Neck on the left, and Inner Heron Island showing in front.
Gliding between this and the ledges known as the Thread of Life,
they speedily rounded to at the wharf at Christmas Cove. As elsewhere,
there were yachts, sailboats and various kinds of craft at anchor
or secured to the floats. To one of the latter the three friends
made the launch fast and passed over the pier and by the hall
where entertainments and religious services are held. The water
so far north as Maine is as a rule too cold for popular bathing.
At Christmas Cove this difficulty is overcome by a goodly sized
pool into which the salt water is admitted at high tide, when
the gates are closed and it is held until the time comes for changing
it.</p>

<p>The opportunity was too good to be lost, and the youngsters each
rented a suit and a bath house, from which they emerged and plunged
delightedly into the pool. It will be remembered that Mike Murphy
could not swim a stroke, but the pond is prepared for such persons,
and all he had to do was to keep away from the corner near the
gates, which is the only place where the water is beyond one's
depth. Alvin and Chester were fine swimmers and dived and frolicked
until they were sated. They tried to teach the rudiments of swimming
to their comrade, but he made no progress and they had to give
over the attempt for the time.</p>

<p>It was but a short climb to the Hollywood Inn, where the genial
Landlord Thorpe gave them welcome and they wrote their names in
the ledger. Then they walked out on the rear porch to admire the
romantic scenery, while awaiting the dinner hour. On one side
was the placid Cove, making up from the Damariscotta River and
dotted with pleasure craft; on the other, John's Bay and the broad
Atlantic. Pointing toward the historical Pemaquid Point, on the
opposite side of the Bay, Alvin said to his companions:</p>

<p>"All looks calm and peaceful now, but how different it was on
that September day in 1813!"</p>

<p>They turned inquiringly toward him.</p>

<p>"Right off yonder the American brig <em>Enterprise</em> of fourteen
guns, commanded by Captain Burrows, fought the British <em>Boxer</em>,
also of fourteen guns. It was a desperate battle in which both
captains were killed and the British vessel captured. The prize
was taken into Portland harbor, and the two commanders lie buried
side by side in the city."</p>
