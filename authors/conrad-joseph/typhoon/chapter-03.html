<p>Jukes was as ready a man as any half-dozen young mates that may
be caught by casting a net upon the waters; and though he had
been somewhat taken aback by the startling viciousness of the
first squall, he had pulled himself together on the instant, had
called out the hands and had rushed them along to secure such
openings about the deck as had not been already battened down
earlier in the evening. Shouting in his fresh, stentorian voice,
"Jump, boys, and bear a hand!" he led in the work, telling himself
the while that he had "just expected this."</p>

<p>But at the same time he was growing aware that this was rather
more than he had expected. From the first stir of the air felt
on his cheek the gale seemed to take upon itself the accumulated
impetus of an avalanche. Heavy sprays enveloped the Nan-Shan from
stem to stern, and instantly in the midst of her regular rolling
she began to jerk and plunge as though she had gone mad with fright.</p>

<p>Jukes thought, "This is no joke." While he was exchanging explanatory
yells with his captain, a sudden lowering of the darkness came
upon the night, falling before their vision like something palpable.
It was as if the masked lights of the world had been turned down.
Jukes was uncritically glad to have his captain at hand. It relieved
him as though that man had, by simply coming on deck, taken most
of the gale's weight upon his shoulders. Such is the prestige,
the privilege, and the burden of command.</p>

<p>Captain MacWhirr could expect no relief of that sort from any
one on earth. Such is the loneliness of command. He was trying
to see, with that watchful manner of a seaman who stares into
the wind's eye as if into the eye of an adversary, to penetrate
the hidden intention and guess the aim and force of the thrust.
The strong wind swept at him out of a vast obscurity; he felt
under his feet the uneasiness of his ship, and he could not even
discern the shadow of her shape. He wished it were not so; and
very still he waited, feeling stricken by a blind man's helplessness.</p>

<p>To be silent was natural to him, dark or shine. Jukes, at his
elbow, made himself heard yelling cheerily in the gusts, "We must
have got the worst of it at once, sir." A faint burst of lightning
quivered all round, as if flashed into a cavern&mdash;into a black
and secret chamber of the sea, with a floor of foaming crests.</p>

<p>It unveiled for a sinister, fluttering moment a ragged mass of
clouds hanging low, the lurch of the long outlines of the ship,
the black figures of men caught on the bridge, heads forward,
as if petrified in the act of butting. The darkness palpitated
down upon all this, and then the real thing came at last.</p>

<p>It was something formidable and swift, like the sudden smashing
of a vial of wrath. It seemed to explode all round the ship with
an overpowering concussion and a rush of great waters, as if an
immense dam had been blown up to windward. In an instant the men
lost touch of each other. This is the disintegrating power of
a great wind: it isolates one from one's kind. An earthquake,
a landslip, an avalanche, overtake a man incidentally, as it were&mdash;without
passion. A furious gale attacks him like a personal enemy, tries
to grasp his limbs, fastens upon his mind, seeks to rout his very
spirit out of him.</p>

<p>Jukes was driven away from his commander. He fancied himself
whirled a great distance through the air. Everything disappeared&mdash;even,
for a moment, his power of thinking; but his hand had found one
of the rail-stanchions. His distress was by no means alleviated
by an inclination to disbelieve the reality of this experience.
Though young, he had seen some bad weather, and had never doubted
his ability to imagine the worst; but this was so much beyond
his powers of fancy that it appeared incompatible with the existence
of any ship whatever. He would have been incredulous about himself
in the same way, perhaps, had he not been so harassed by the necessity
of exerting a wrestling effort against a force trying to tear
him away from his hold. Moreover, the conviction of not being
utterly destroyed returned to him through the sensations of being
half-drowned, bestially shaken, and partly choked.</p>

<p>It seemed to him he remained there precariously alone with the
stanchion for a long, long time. The rain poured on him, flowed,
drove in sheets. He breathed in gasps; and sometimes the water
he swallowed was fresh and sometimes it was salt. For the most
part he kept his eyes shut tight, as if suspecting his sight might
be destroyed in the immense flurry of the elements. When he ventured
to blink hastily, he derived some moral support from the green
gleam of the starboard light shining feebly upon the flight of
rain and sprays. He was actually looking at it when its ray fell
upon the uprearing sea which put it out. He saw the head of the
wave topple over, adding the mite of its crash to the tremendous
uproar raging around him, and almost at the same instant the stanchion
was wrenched away from his embracing arms. After a crushing thump
on his back he found himself suddenly afloat and borne upwards.
His first irresistible notion was that the whole China Sea had
climbed on the bridge. Then, more sanely, he concluded himself
gone overboard. All the time he was being tossed, flung, and rolled
in great volumes of water, he kept on repeating mentally, with
the utmost precipitation, the words: "My God! My God! My God!
My God!"</p>

<p>All at once, in a revolt of misery and despair, he formed the
crazy resolution to get out of that. And he began to thresh about
with his arms and legs. But as soon as he commenced his wretched
struggles he discovered that he had become somehow mixed up with
a face, an oilskin coat, somebody's boots. He clawed ferociously
all these things in turn, lost them, found them again, lost them
once more, and finally was himself caught in the firm clasp of
a pair of stout arms. He returned the embrace closely round a
thick solid body. He had found his captain.</p>

<p>They tumbled over and over, tightening their hug. Suddenly the
water let them down with a brutal bang; and, stranded against
the side of the wheelhouse, out of breath and bruised, they were
left to stagger up in the wind and hold on where they could.</p>

<p>Jukes came out of it rather horrified, as though he had escaped
some unparalleled outrage directed at his feelings. It weakened
his faith in himself. He started shouting aimlessly to the man
he could feel near him in that fiendish blackness, "Is it you,
sir? Is it you, sir?" till his temples seemed ready to burst.
And he heard in answer a voice, as if crying far away, as if screaming
to him fretfully from a very great distance, the one word "Yes!"
Other seas swept again over the bridge. He received them defencelessly
right over his bare head, with both his hands engaged in holding.</p>

<p>The motion of the ship was extravagant. Her lurches had an appalling
helplessness: she pitched as if taking a header into a void, and
seemed to find a wall to hit every time. When she rolled she fell
on her side headlong, and she would be righted back by such a
demolishing blow that Jukes felt her reeling as a clubbed man
reels before he collapses. The gale howled and scuffled about
gigantically in the darkness, as though the entire world were
one black gully. At certain moments the air streamed against the
ship as if sucked through a tunnel with a concentrated solid force
of impact that seemed to lift her clean out of the water and keep
her up for an instant with only a quiver running through her from
end to end. And then she would begin her tumbling again as if
dropped back into a boiling cauldron. Jukes tried hard to compose
his mind and judge things coolly.</p>

<p>The sea, flattened down in the heavier gusts, would uprise and
overwhelm both ends of the Nan-Shan in snowy rushes of foam, expanding
wide, beyond both rails, into the night. And on this dazzling
sheet, spread under the blackness of the clouds and emitting a
bluish glow, Captain MacWhirr could catch a desolate glimpse of
a few tiny specks black as ebony, the tops of the hatches, the
battened companions, the heads of the covered winches, the foot
of a mast. This was all he could see of his ship. Her middle structure,
covered by the bridge which bore him, his mate, the closed wheelhouse
where a man was steering shut up with the fear of being swept
overboard together with the whole thing in one great crash&mdash;her
middle structure was like a half-tide rock awash upon a coast.
It was like an outlying rock with the water boiling up, streaming
over, pouring off, beating round&mdash;like a rock in the surf to which
shipwrecked people cling before they let go&mdash;only it rose, it
sank, it rolled continuously, without respite and rest, like a
rock that should have miraculously struck adrift from a coast
and gone wallowing upon the sea.</p>

<p>The Nan-Shan was being looted by the storm with a senseless,
destructive fury: trysails torn out of the extra gaskets, double-lashed
awnings blown away, bridge swept clean, weather-cloths burst,
rails twisted, light-screens smashed&mdash;and two of the boats had
gone already. They had gone unheard and unseen, melting, as it
were, in the shock and smother of the wave. It was only later,
when upon the white flash of another high sea hurling itself amidships,
Jukes had a vision of two pairs of davits leaping black and empty
out of the solid blackness, with one overhauled fall flying and
an iron-bound block capering in the air, that he became aware
of what had happened within about three yards of his back.</p>

<p>He poked his head forward, groping for the ear of his commander.
His lips touched it&mdash;big, fleshy, very wet. He cried in an agitated
tone, "Our boats are going now, sir."</p>

<p>And again he heard that voice, forced and ringing feebly, but
with a penetrating effect of quietness in the enormous discord
of noises, as if sent out from some remote spot of peace beyond
the black wastes of the gale; again he heard a man's voice&mdash;the
frail and indomitable sound that can be made to carry an infinity
of thought, resolution and purpose, that shall be pronouncing
confident words on the last day, when heavens fall, and justice
is done&mdash;again he heard it, and it was crying to him, as if from
very, very far&mdash;"All right."</p>

<p>He thought he had not managed to make himself understood. "Our
boats &mdash;I say boats&mdash;the boats, sir! Two gone!"</p>

<p>The same voice, within a foot of him and yet so remote, yelled
sensibly, "Can't be helped."</p>

<p>Captain MacWhirr had never turned his face, but Jukes caught
some more words on the wind.</p>

<p>"What can&mdash;expect&mdash;when hammering through&mdash;such &mdash;Bound
to leave&mdash;something behind&mdash;stands to reason."</p>

<p>Watchfully Jukes listened for more. No more came. This was all
Captain MacWhirr had to say; and Jukes could picture to himself
rather than see the broad squat back before him. An impenetrable
obscurity pressed down upon the ghostly glimmers of the sea. A
dull conviction seized upon Jukes that there was nothing to be
done.</p>

<p>If the steering-gear did not give way, if the immense volumes
of water did not burst the deck in or smash one of the hatches,
if the engines did not give up, if way could be kept on the ship
against this terrific wind, and she did not bury herself in one
of these awful seas, of whose white crests alone, topping high
above her bows, he could now and then get a sickening glimpse&mdash;then
there was a chance of her coming out of it. Something within him
seemed to turn over, bringing uppermost the feeling that the Nan-Shan
was lost.</p>

<p>"She's done for," he said to himself, with a surprising mental
agitation, as though he had discovered an unexpected meaning in
this thought. One of these things was bound to happen. Nothing
could be prevented now, and nothing could be remedied. The men
on board did not count, and the ship could not last. This weather
was too impossible.</p>

<p>Jukes felt an arm thrown heavily over his shoulders; and to this
overture he responded with great intelligence by catching hold
of his captain round the waist.</p>

<p>They stood clasped thus in the blind night, bracing each other
against the wind, cheek to cheek and lip to ear, in the manner
of two hulks lashed stem to stern together.</p>

<p>And Jukes heard the voice of his commander hardly any louder
than before, but nearer, as though, starting to march athwart
the prodigious rush of the hurricane, it had approached him, bearing
that strange effect of quietness like the serene glow of a halo.</p>

<p>"D'ye know where the hands got to?" it asked, vigorous and evanescent
at the same time, overcoming the strength of the wind, and swept
away from Jukes instantly.</p>

<p>Jukes didn't know. They were all on the bridge when the real
force of the hurricane struck the ship. He had no idea where they
had crawled to. Under the circumstances they were nowhere, for
all the use that could be made of them. Somehow the Captain's
wish to know distressed Jukes.</p>

<p>"Want the hands, sir?" he cried, apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Ought to know," asserted Captain MacWhirr. "Hold hard."</p>

<p>They held hard. An outburst of unchained fury, a vicious rush
of the wind absolutely steadied the ship; she rocked only, quick
and light like a child's cradle, for a terrific moment of suspense,
while the whole atmosphere, as it seemed, streamed furiously past
her, roaring away from the tenebrous earth.</p>

<p>It suffocated them, and with eyes shut they tightened their grasp.
What from the magnitude of the shock might have been a column
of water running upright in the dark, butted against the ship,
broke short, and fell on her bridge, crushingly, from on high,
with a dead burying weight.</p>

<p>A flying fragment of that collapse, a mere splash, enveloped
them in one swirl from their feet over their heads, filling violently
their ears, mouths and nostrils with salt water. It knocked out
their legs, wrenched in haste at their arms, seethed away swiftly
under their chins; and opening their eyes, they saw the piled-up
masses of foam dashing to and fro amongst what looked like the
fragments of a ship. She had given way as if driven straight in.
Their panting hearts yielded, too, before the tremendous blow;
and all at once she sprang up again to her desperate plunging,
as if trying to scramble out from under the ruins.</p>

<p>The seas in the dark seemed to rush from all sides to keep her
back where she might perish. There was hate in the way she was
handled, and a ferocity in the blows that fell. She was like a
living creature thrown to the rage of a mob: hustled terribly,
struck at, borne up, flung down, leaped upon. Captain MacWhirr
and Jukes kept hold of each other, deafened by the noise, gagged
by the wind; and the great physical tumult beating about their
bodies, brought, like an unbridled display of passion, a profound
trouble to their souls. One of those wild and appalling shrieks
that are heard at times passing mysteriously overhead in the steady
roar of a hurricane, swooped, as if borne on wings, upon the ship,
and Jukes tried to outscream it.</p>

<p>"Will she live through this?"</p>

<p>The cry was wrenched out of his breast. It was as unintentional
as the birth of a thought in the head, and he heard nothing of
it himself. It all became extinct at once&mdash;thought, intention,
effort&mdash;and of his cry the inaudible vibration added to the tempest
waves of the air.</p>

<p>He expected nothing from it. Nothing at all. For indeed what
answer could be made? But after a while he heard with amazement
the frail and resisting voice in his ear, the dwarf sound, unconquered
in the giant tumult.</p>

<p>"She may!"</p>

<p>It was a dull yell, more difficult to seize than a whisper. And
presently the voice returned again, half submerged in the vast
crashes, like a ship battling against the waves of an ocean.</p>

<p>"Let's hope so!" it cried&mdash;small, lonely and unmoved, a stranger
to the visions of hope or fear; and it flickered into disconnected
words: "Ship. . . . . This. . . . Never &mdash;Anyhow . . . for
the best." Jukes gave it up.</p>

<p>Then, as if it had come suddenly upon the one thing fit to withstand
the power of a storm, it seemed to gain force and firmness for
the last broken shouts:</p>

<p>"Keep on hammering . . . builders . . . good men. . . . . And
chance it . . . engines. . . . Rout . . . good man."</p>

<p>Captain MacWhirr removed his arm from Jukes' shoulders, and thereby
ceased to exist for his mate, so dark it was; Jukes, after a tense
stiffening of every muscle, would let himself go limp all over.
The gnawing of profound discomfort existed side by side with an
incredible disposition to somnolence, as though he had been buffeted
and worried into drowsiness. The wind would get hold of his head
and try to shake it off his shoulders; his clothes, full of water,
were as heavy as lead, cold and dripping like an armour of melting
ice: he shivered&mdash;it lasted a long time; and with his hands closed
hard on his hold, he was letting himself sink slowly into the
depths of bodily misery. His mind became concentrated upon himself
in an aimless, idle way, and when something pushed lightly at
the back of his knees he nearly, as the saying is, jumped out
of his skin.</p>

<p>In the start forward he bumped the back of Captain MacWhirr,
who didn't move; and then a hand gripped his thigh. A lull had
come, a menacing lull of the wind, the holding of a stormy breath&mdash;and
he felt himself pawed all over. It was the boatswain. Jukes recognized
these hands, so thick and enormous that they seemed to belong
to some new species of man.</p>

<p>The boatswain had arrived on the bridge, crawling on all fours
against the wind, and had found the chief mate's legs with the
top of his head. Immediately he crouched and began to explore
Jukes' person upwards with prudent, apologetic touches, as became
an inferior.</p>

<p>He was an ill-favoured, undersized, gruff sailor of fifty, coarsely
hairy, short-legged, long-armed, resembling an elderly ape. His
strength was immense; and in his great lumpy paws, bulging like
brown boxing-gloves on the end of furry forearms, the heaviest
objects were handled like playthings. Apart from the grizzled
pelt on his chest, the menacing demeanour and the hoarse voice,
he had none of the classical attributes of his rating. His good
nature almost amounted to imbecility: the men did what they liked
with him, and he had not an ounce of initiative in his character,
which was easy-going and talkative. For these reasons Jukes disliked
him; but Captain MacWhirr, to Jukes' scornful disgust, seemed
to regard him as a first-rate petty officer.</p>

<p>He pulled himself up by Jukes' coat, taking that liberty with
the greatest moderation, and only so far as it was forced upon
him by the hurricane.</p>

<p>"What is it, boss'n, what is it?" yelled Jukes, impatiently.
What could that fraud of a boss'n want on the bridge? The typhoon
had got on Jukes' nerves. The husky bellowings of the other, though
unintelligible, seemed to suggest a state of lively satisfaction.</p>

<p>There could be no mistake. The old fool was pleased with something.</p>

<p>The boatswain's other hand had found some other body, for in
a changed tone he began to inquire: "Is it you, sir? Is it you,
sir?" The wind strangled his howls.</p>

<p>"Yes!" cried Captain MacWhirr.</p>
