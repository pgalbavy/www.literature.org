<P>Aramis was generally temperate; but on this occasion, while
taking every care of his constitution, he did ample justice
to Baisemeaux's breakfast, which, in all respects, was most
excellent. The latter, on his side, was animated with the
wildest gayety; the sight of the five thousand pistoles,
which he glanced at from time to time, seemed to open his
heart. Every now and then he looked at Aramis with an
expression of the deepest gratitude; while the latter,
leaning back in his chair, took a few sips of wine from his
glass, with the air of a connoisseur. &quot;Let me never hear any
ill words against the fare of the Bastile,&quot; said he, half
closing his eyes; &quot;happy are the prisoners who can get only
half a bottle of such Burgundy every day.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All those at fifteen francs drink it,&quot; said Baisemeaux. &quot;It
is very old Volnay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Does that poor student, Seldon, drink such good wine?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, no!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I thought I heard you say he was boarded at fifteen
francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He! no, indeed; a man who makes districts  -  distichs, I
mean  -  at fifteen francs! No, no! it is his neighbor who is
at fifteen francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Which neighbor?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The other, second Bertaudiere.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Excuse me, my dear governor; but you speak a language which
requires quite an apprenticeship to understand.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very true,&quot; said the governor. &quot;Allow me to explain: second
Bertaudiere is the person who occupies the second floor of
the tower of the Bertaudiere.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So that Bertaudiere is the name of one of the towers of the
Bastile? The fact is, I think I recollect hearing that each
tower has a name of its own. Whereabouts is the one you are
speaking of?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Look,&quot; said Baisemeaux, going to the window. &quot;It is that
tower to the left  - -the second one.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is the prisoner at fifteen francs there?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Since when?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Seven or eight years, nearly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean by nearly? Do you not know the dates more
precisely?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It was not in my time, M. d'Herblay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I should have thought that Louviere or Tremblay would
have told you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The secrets of the Bastile are never handed over with the
keys of the governorship.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed! Then the cause of his imprisonment is a mystery  - 
a state secret.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh no! I do not suppose it is a state secret, but a secret
 -  like everything else that happens at the Bastile.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;why do you speak more freely of Seldon
than of second Bertaudiere?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because, in my opinion, the crime of the man who writes a
distich is not so great as that of the man who resembles
 -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes, I understand you. Still, do not the turnkeys talk
with your prisoners?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The prisoners, I suppose, tell them they are not guilty?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They are always telling them that; it is a matter of
course; the same song over and over again.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But does not the resemblance you were speaking about just
now strike the turnkeys?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My dear M. d'Herblay, it is only for men attached to the
court, as you are, to take trouble about such matters.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're right, you're right, my dear M. Baisemeaux. Let me
give you another taste of this Volnay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not a taste merely, a full glass; fill yours too.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nay, nay! You are a musketeer still, to the very tips of
your fingers, while I have become a bishop. A taste for me;
a glass for yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As you please.&quot; And Aramis and the governor nodded to each
other, as they drank their wine. &quot;But,&quot; said Aramis, looking
with fixed attention at the ruby-colored wine he had raised
to the level of his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy it with
all his senses at the same moment, &quot;but what you might call
a resemblance, another would not, perhaps, take any notice
of.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Most certainly he would, though, if it were any one who
knew the person he resembles.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I really think, dear M. Baisemeaux, that it can be nothing
more than a resemblance of your own creation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Upon my honor, it is not so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stay,&quot; continued Aramis, &quot;I have seen many persons very
like the one we are speaking of; but, out of respect, no one
ever said anything about it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very likely; because there is resemblance and resemblance.
This is a striking one, and, if you were to see him, you
would admit it to be so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If I were to see him, indeed,&quot; said Aramis, in an
indifferent tone; &quot;but in all probability I never shall.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because if I were even to put my foot inside one of those
horrible dungeons, I should fancy I was buried there
forever.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no; the cells are very good places to live in.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I really do not, and cannot believe it, and that is a
fact.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pray do not speak ill of second Bertaudiere. It is really a
good room, very nicely furnished and carpeted. The young
fellow has by no means been unhappy there; the best lodging
the Bastile affords has been his. There is a chance for
you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nay, nay,&quot; said Aramis, coldly; &quot;you will never make me
believe there are any good rooms in the Bastile; and, as for
your carpets, they exist only in your imagination. I should
find nothing but spiders, rats, and perhaps toads, too.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Toads?&quot; cried Baisemeaux.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, in the dungeons.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! I don't say there are not toads in the dungeons,&quot;
replied Baisemeaux. &quot;But  -  will you be convinced by your
own eyes?&quot; he continued, with a sudden impulse.</P>
<P>&quot;No, certainly not.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not even to satisfy yourself of the resemblance which you
deny, as you do the carpets?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Some spectral-looking person, a mere shadow; an unhappy,
dying man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing of the kind  -  as brisk and vigorous a young fellow
as ever lived.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Melancholy and ill-tempered, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not at all; very gay and lively.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nonsense; you are joking.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Will you follow me?&quot; said Baisemeaux.</P>
<P>&quot;What for?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To go the round of the Bastile.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will then see for yourself  -  see with your own eyes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But the regulations?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never mind them. To-day my major has leave of absence; the
lieutenant is visiting the post on the bastions; we are sole
masters of the situation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no, my dear governor; why, the very idea of the sound
of the bolts makes me shudder. You will only have to forget
me in second or fourth Bertaudiere, and then  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are refusing an opportunity that may never present
itself again. Do you know that, to obtain the favor I
propose to you gratis, some of the princes of the blood have
offered me as much as fifty thousand francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Really! he must be worth seeing, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Forbidden fruit, my lord, forbidden fruit. You who belong
to the church ought to know that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, if I had any curiosity, it would be to see the poor
author of the distich.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, we will see him, too; but if I were at all
curious, it would be about the beautiful carpeted room and
its lodger.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Furniture is very commonplace; and a face with no
expression in it offers little or no interest.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But a boarder at fifteen francs is always interesting.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;By the by, I forgot to ask you about that. Why fifteen
francs for him, and only three francs for poor Seldon?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The distinction made in that instance was a truly noble
act, and one which displayed the king's goodness of heart to
great advantage.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The king's, you say.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The cardinal's, I mean. `This unhappy man,' said M.
Mazarin, `is destined to remain in prison forever.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, it seems that his crime is a lasting one, and,
consequently, his punishment ought to be so, too.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Lasting?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No doubt of it, unless he is fortunate enough to catch the
small-pox, and even that is difficult, for we never get any
impure air here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing can be more ingenious than your train of reasoning,
my dear M. de Baisemeaux. Do you, however, mean to say that
this unfortunate man must suffer without interruption or
termination?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I did not say he was to suffer, my lord, a fifteen-franc
boarder does not suffer.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He suffers imprisonment, at all events.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No doubt; there is no help for that, but this suffering is
sweetened for him. You must admit that this young fellow was
not born to eat all the good things he does eat; for
instance, such things as we have on the table now; this
pasty that has not been touched, these crawfish from the
River Marne, of which we have hardly taken any, and which
are almost as large as lobsters; all these things will at
once be taken to second Bertaudiere, with a bottle of that
Volnay which you think so excellent. After you have seen it
you will believe it, I hope.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, my dear governor, certainly; but all this time you are
thinking only of your very happy fifteen-franc prisoner, and
you forget poor Seldon, my protege.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, out of consideration for you, it shall be a gala day
for him; he shall have some biscuits and preserves with this
small bottle of port.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are a good-hearted fellow; I have said so already, and
I repeat it, my dear Baisemeaux.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, let us set off, then,&quot; said the governor, a little
bewildered, partly from the wine he had drunk, and partly
from Aramis's praises.</P>
<P>&quot;Do not forget that I only go to oblige you,&quot; said the
prelate.</P>
<P>&quot;Very well; but you will thank me when you get there.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us go, then.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wait until I have summoned the jailer,&quot; said Baisemeaux, as
he struck the bell twice, at which summons a man appeared.
&quot;I am going to visit the towers,&quot; said the governor. &quot;No
guards, no drums, no noise at all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If I were not to leave my cloak here,&quot; said Aramis,
pretending to be alarmed; &quot;I should really think I was going
to prison on my own account.&quot;</P>
<P>The jailer preceded the governor, Aramis walking on his
right hand; some of the soldiers who happened to be in the
courtyard drew themselves up in line, as stiff as posts, as
the governor passed along. Baisemeaux led the way down
several steps which conducted to a sort of esplanade; thence
they arrived at the draw-bridge, where the sentinels on duty
received the governor with the proper honors. The governor
turned toward Aramis, and, speaking in such a tone that the
sentinels could not lose a word, he observed,  -  &quot;I hope you
have a good memory, monsieur?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why?&quot; inquired Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;On account of your plans and your measurements, for you
know that no one is allowed, not architects even, to enter
where the prisoners are, with paper, pens or pencil.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good,&quot; said Aramis to himself, &quot;it seems I am an architect,
then. It sounds like one of D'Artagnan's jokes, who
perceived in me the engineer of Belle-Isle.&quot; Then he added
aloud: &quot;Be easy on that score, monsieur; in our profession,
a mere glance and a good memory are quite sufficient.&quot;</P>
<P>Baisemeaux did not change countenance, and the soldiers took
Aramis for what he seemed to be. &quot;Very well; we will first
visit la Bertaudiere, &quot;said Baisemeaux, still intending the
sentinels to hear him. Then, turning to the jailer, he
added: &quot;You will take the opportunity of carrying to No. 2
the few dainties I pointed out.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Dear M. de Baisemeaux,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;you are always
forgetting No. 3.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So I am,&quot; said the governor; and upon that, they began to
ascend. The number of bolts, gratings, and locks for this
single courtyard would have sufficed for the safety of an
entire city. Aramis was neither an imaginative nor a
sensitive man; he had been somewhat of a poet in his youth,
but his heart was hard and indifferent, as the heart of
every man of fifty-five years of age is, who has been
frequently and passionately attached to women in his
lifetime, or rather who has been passionately loved by them.
But when he placed his foot upon the worn stone steps, along
which so many unhappy wretches had passed, when he felt
himself impregnated, as it were, with the atmosphere of
those gloomy dungeons, moistened with tears, there could be
but little doubt he was overcome by his feelings, for his
head was bowed and his eyes became dim, as he followed
Baisemeaux without a syllable.</P></div>
