<p>Edward Cossey drove from the Castle in a far from happy frame of mind.
To begin with, the Squire and his condescending way of doing business
irritated him very much, so much that once or twice in the course of the
conversation he was within an ace of breaking the whole thing off,
and only restrained himself with difficulty from doing so. As it
was, notwithstanding all the sacrifices and money risks which he was
undergoing to take up these mortgages, and they were very considerable
even to a man of his great prospects, he felt that he had been placed in
the position of a person who receives a favour rather than of a person
who grants one. Moreover there was an assumption of superiority about
the old man, a visible recognition of the gulf which used to be fixed
between the gentleman of family and the man of business who has grown
rich by trading in money and money's worth, which was the more galling
because it was founded on actual fact, and Edward Cossey knew it. All
his foibles and oddities notwithstanding, it would have been impossible
for any person of discernment to entertain a comparison between the
half-ruined Squire and the young banker, who would shortly be worth
between half a million and a million sterling. The former was a
representative, though a somewhat erratic one, of all that is best in
the old type of Englishmen of gentle blood, which is now so rapidly
vanishing, and of the class to which to a large extent this country owes
her greatness. His very eccentricities were wandering lights that showed
unsuspected heights and depths in his character--love of country and his
country's honour, respect for the religion of his fathers, loyalty of
mind and valour for the right. Had he lived in other times, like some
of the old Boisseys and de la Molles, who were at Honham before him, he
would probably have died in the Crusades or at Cressy, or perhaps more
uselessly, for his King at Marston Moor, or like that last but one
of the true de la Molles, kneeling in the courtyard of his Castle
and defying his enemies to wring his secret from him. Now few such
opportunities are left to men of his stamp, and they are, perhaps as a
consequence, dying out of an age which is unsuited to them, and indeed
to most strong growths of individual character. It would be much easier
to deal with a gentleman like the Squire of this history if we could
only reach down one of those suits of armour from the walls of his
vestibule, and put it on his back, and take that long two-handled sword
which last flashed on Flodden Field from its resting-place beneath the
clock, and at the end see him die as a loyal knight should do in the
forefront of his retainers, with the old war cry of "<u>a Delamol--a
Delamol</u>" upon his lips. As it is, he is an aristocratic anachronism,
an entity unfitted to deal with the elements of our advanced and in some
ways emasculated age. His body should have been where his heart was--in
the past. What chance have such as he against the Quests of this polite
era of political economy and penny papers?
</p><p>No wonder that Edward Cossey felt his inferiority to this symbol and
type of the things that no more are, yes even in the shadow of his
thirty thousand pounds. For here we have a different breed. Goldsmiths
two centuries ago, then bankers from generation to generation, money
bees seeking for wealth and counting it and hiving it from decade to
decade, till at last gold became to them what honour is to the nobler
stock--the pervading principle, and the clink of the guinea and the
rustling of the bank note stirred their blood as the clank of armed men
and the sound of the flapping banner with its three golden hawks flaming
in the sun, was wont to set the hearts of the race of Boissey, of
Dofferleigh and of de la Molle, beating to that tune to which England
marched on to win the world.
</p><p>It is a foolish and vain thing to scoff at business and those who do it
in the market places, and to shout out the old war cries of our fathers,
in the face of a generation which sings the song of capital, or groans
in heavy labour beneath the banners of their copyrighted trade marks;
and besides, who would buy our books (also copyrighted except in
America) if we did? Let us rather rise up and clothe ourselves, and put
a tall hat upon our heads and do homage to the new Democracy.
</p><p>And yet in the depths of our hearts and the quiet of our chambers let
us sometimes cry to the old days, and the old men, and the old ways of
thought, let us cry "<u>Ave atque vale</u>,--Hail and farewell." Our fathers'
armour hangs above the door, their portraits decorate the wall, and
their fierce and half-tamed hearts moulder beneath the stones of yonder
church. Hail and farewell to you, our fathers! Perchance a man might
have had worse company than he met with at your boards, and even have
found it not more hard to die beneath your sword-cuts than to be gently
cozened to the grave by duly qualified practitioners at two guineas a
visit.
</p><p>And the upshot of all this is that the Squire was not altogether wrong
when he declared in the silence of <u>his</u> chamber that Edward Cossey was
not quite a gentleman. He showed it when he allowed himself to be guided
by the arts of Mr. Quest into the adoption of the idea of obtaining a
lien upon Ida, to be enforced if convenient. He showed it again, and
what is more he committed a huge mistake, when tempted thereto by the
opportunity of the moment, he made a conditional bargain with the said
Ida, whereby she was placed in pledge for a sum of thirty thousand
pounds, well knowing that her honour would be equal to the test, and
that if convenient to him she would be ready to pay the debt. He made
a huge mistake, for had he been quite a gentleman, he would have known
that he could not have adopted a worse road to the affections of a lady.
Had he been content to advance the money and then by-and-bye, though
even that would not have been gentlemanlike, have gently let transpire
what he had done at great personal expense and inconvenience, her
imagination might have been touched and her gratitude would certainly
have been excited. But the idea of bargaining, the idea of purchase,
which after what had passed could never be put aside, would of necessity
be fatal to any hope of tender feeling. Shylock might get his bond,
but of his own act he had debarred himself from the possibility of ever
getting more.
</p><p>Now Edward Cossey was not lacking in that afterglow of refinement
which is left by a course of public school and university education. No
education can make a gentleman of a man who is not a gentleman at heart,
for whether his station in life be that of a ploughboy or an Earl, the
gentleman, like the poet, is born and not made. But it can and does if
he be of an observant nature, give him a certain insight into the habits
of thought and probable course of action of the members of that class
to which he outwardly, and by repute, belongs. Such an insight Edward
Cossey possessed, and at the present moment its possession was troubling
him very much. His trading instincts, the desire bred in him to get
something for his money, had led him to make the bargain, but now that
it was done his better judgment rose up against it. For the truth may as
well be told at once, although he would as yet scarcely acknowledge it
to himself, Edward Cossey was already violently enamoured of Ida. He was
by nature a passionate man, and as it chanced she had proved the magnet
with power to draw his passion. But as the reader is aware, there
existed another complication in his life for which he was not perhaps
entirely responsible. When still quite a youth in mind, he had suddenly
found himself the object of the love of a beautiful and enthralling
woman, and had after a more or less severe struggle yielded to the
temptation, as, out of a book, many young men would have done. Now to be
the object of the violent affection of such a woman as Belle Quest is
no doubt very flattering and even charming for a while. But if that
affection is not returned in kind, if in short the gentleman does not
love the lady quite as warmly as she loves him, then in course of
time the charm is apt to vanish and even the flattery to cease to give
pleasure. Also, when as in the present case the connection is wrong in
itself and universally condemned by society, the affection which can
still triumph and endure on both sides must be of a very strong and
lasting order. Even an unprincipled man dislikes the acting of one long
lie such as an intimacy of the sort necessarily involves, and if the man
happens to be rather weak than unprincipled, the dislike is apt to turn
to loathing, some portion of which will certainly be reflected on to the
partner of his ill-doing.
</p><p>These are general principles, but the case of Edward Cossey offered no
exception to them, indeed it illustrated them well. He had never been
in love with Mrs. Quest; to begin with she had shown herself too much
in love with him to necessitate any display of emotion on his part. Her
violent and unreasoning passion wearied and alarmed him, he never knew
what she would do next and was kept in a continual condition of anxiety
and irritation as to what the morrow might bring forth. Too sure of
her unaltering attachment to have any pretext for jealousy, he found it
exceedingly irksome to be obliged to avoid giving cause for it on his
side, which, however, he dreaded doing lest he should thereby bring
about some overwhelming catastrophe. Mrs. Quest was, as he well knew,
not a woman who would pause to consider consequences if once her
passionate jealousy were really aroused. It was even doubtful if the
certainty of her own ruin would check her. Her love was everything to
her, it was her life, the thing she lived for, and rather than tamely
lose it, it seemed extremely probable to Edward Cossey that she would
not hesitate to face shame, or even death. Indeed it was through this
great passion of hers, and through it only, that he could hope to
influence her. If he could persuade her to release him, by pointing
out that a continuance of the intrigue must involve him in ruin of some
sort, all might yet go well with him. If not his future was a dark one.
</p><p>This was the state of affairs before he became attached to Ida de la
Molle, after which the horizon grew blacker than ever. At first he tried
to get out of the difficulty by avoiding Ida, but it did not answer.
She exercised an irresistible attraction over him. Her calm and stately
presence was to him what the sight of mountain snows is to one scorched
by continual heat. He was weary of passionate outbursts, tears, agonies,
alarms, presentiments, and all the paraphernalia of secret love. It
appeared to him, looking up at the beautiful snow, that if once he could
reach it life would be all sweetness and light, that there would be
no more thirst, no more fear, and no more forced marches through those
ill-odoured quagmires of deceit. The more he allowed his imagination
to dwell upon the picture, the fiercer grew his longing to possess it.
Also, he knew well enough that to marry a woman like Ida de la Molle
would be the greatest blessing that could happen to him, for she would
of necessity lift him up above himself. She had little money it was
true, but that was a very minor matter to him, and she had birth and
breeding and beauty, and a presence which commands homage. And so it
came to pass that he fell deeply and yet more deeply in love with Ida,
and that as he did so his connection with Mrs. Quest (although we have
seen him but yesterday offering in a passing fit of tenderness and
remorse to run away with her) became more and more irksome to him.
And now, as he drove leisurely back to Boisingham, he felt that he had
imperilled all his hopes by a rash indulgence in his trading instincts.
</p><p>Presently the road took a turn and a sight was revealed that did not
tend to improve his already irritable mood. Just here the roadway was
bordered by a deep bank covered with trees which sloped down to the
valley of the Ell, at this time of the year looking its loveliest in
the soft autumn lights. And here, seated on a bank of turf beneath the
shadow of a yellowing chestnut tree, in such position as to get a view
of the green valley and flashing river where cattle red and white stood
chewing the still luxuriant aftermath, was none other than Ida herself,
and what was more, Ida accompanied by Colonel Quaritch. They were seated
on campstools, and in front of each of them was an easel. Clearly they
were painting together, for as Edward gazed, the Colonel rose, came up
close behind his companion's stool made a ring of his thumb and first
finger, gazed critically through it at the lady's performance, then
sadly shook his head and made some remark. Thereupon Ida turned round
and began an animated discussion.
</p><p>"Hang me," said Edward to himself, "if she has not taken up with that
confounded old military frump. Painting together! Ah, I know what that
means. Well, I should have thought that if there was one man more
than another whom she would have disliked, it would have been that
battered-looking Colonel."
</p><p>He pulled up his horse and reflected for a moment, then handing the
reins to his servant, jumped out, and climbing through a gap in the
fence walked up to the tree. So engrossed were they in their argument,
that they neither saw nor heard him.
</p><p>"It's nonsense, Colonel Quaritch, perfect nonsense, if you will forgive
me for telling you so," Ida was saying with warmth. "It is all very well
for you to complain that my trees are a blur, and the castle nothing
but a splotch, but I am looking at the water, and if I am looking at the
water, it is quite impossible that I should see the trees and the cows
otherwise than I have rendered them on the canvas. True art is to paint
what the painter sees and as he sees it."
</p><p>Colonel Quaritch shook his head and sighed.
</p><p>"The cant of the impressionist school," he said sadly; "on the contrary,
the business of the artist is to paint what he knows to be there," and
he gazed complacently at his own canvas, which had the appearance of a
spirited drawing of a fortified place, or of the contents of a child's
Noah's ark, so stiff, so solid, so formidable were its outlines, trees
and animals.
</p><p>Ida shrugged her shoulders, laughed merrily, and turned round to find
herself face to face with Edward Cossey. She started back, and her
expression hardened--then she stretched out her hand and said, "How do
you do?" in her very coldest tones.
</p><p>"How do you do, Miss de la Molle?" he said, assuming as unconcerned an
air as he could, and bowing stiffly to Harold Quaritch, who returned the
bow and went back to his canvas, which was placed a few paces off.
</p><p>"I saw you painting," went on Edward Cossey in a low tone, "so I thought
I would come and tell you that I have settled the matter with Mr. de la
Molle."
</p><p>"Oh, indeed," answered Ida, hitting viciously at a wasp with her paint
brush. "Well, I hope that you will find the investment a satisfactory
one. And now, if you please, do not let us talk any more about money,
because I am quite tired of the subject." Then raising her voice she
went on, "Come here, Colonel Quaritch, and Mr. Cossey shall judge
between us," and she pointed to her picture.
</p><p>Edward glanced at the Colonel with no amiable air. "I know nothing
about art," he said, "and I am afraid that I must be getting on.
Good-morning," and taking off his hat to Ida, he turned and went.
</p><p>"Umph," said the Colonel, looking after him with a quizzical expression,
"that gentleman seems rather short in his temper. Wants knocking about
the world a bit, I should say. But I beg your pardon, I suppose that he
is a friend of yours, Miss de la Molle?"
</p><p>"He is an acquaintance of mine," answered Ida with emphasis.
