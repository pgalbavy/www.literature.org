<p>At about nine o’clock at night, on every alternate Wednesday,
Miss Mary Datchet made the same resolve, that she would never
again lend her rooms for any purposes whatsoever. Being, as they
were, rather large and conveniently situated in a street mostly
dedicated to offices off the Strand, people who wished to meet,
either for purposes of enjoyment, or to discuss art, or to reform
the State, had a way of suggesting that Mary had better be asked
to lend them her rooms. She always met the request with the same
frown of well-simulated annoyance, which presently dissolved in
a kind of half-humorous, half-surly shrug, as of a large dog tormented
by children who shakes his ears. She would lend her room, but
only on condition that all the arrangements were made by her.
This fortnightly meeting of a society for the free discussion
of everything entailed a great deal of moving, and pulling, and
ranging of furniture against the wall, and placing of breakable
and precious things in safe places. Miss Datchet was quite capable
of lifting a kitchen table on her back, if need were, for although
well-proportioned and dressed becomingly, she had the appearance
of unusual strength and determination.</p>

<p>She was some twenty-five years of age, but looked older because
she earned, or intended to earn, her own living, and had already
lost the look of the irresponsible spectator, and taken on that
of the private in the army of workers. Her gestures seemed to
have a certain purpose, the muscles round eyes and lips were set
rather firmly, as though the senses had undergone some discipline,
and were held ready for a call on them. She had contracted two
faint lines between her eyebrows, not from anxiety but from thought,
and it was quite evident that all the feminine instincts of pleasing,
soothing, and charming were crossed by others in no way peculiar
to her sex. For the rest she was brown-eyed, a little clumsy in
movement, and suggested country birth and a descent from respectable
hard-working ancestors, who had been men of faith and integrity
rather than doubters or fanatics.</p>

<p>At the end of a fairly hard day’s work it was certainly something
of an effort to clear one’s room, to pull the mattress off one’s
bed, and lay it on the floor, to fill a pitcher with cold coffee,
and to sweep a long table clear for plates and cups and saucers,
with pyramids of little pink biscuits between them; but when these
alterations were effected, Mary felt a lightness of spirit come
to her, as if she had put off the stout stuff of her working hours
and slipped over her entire being some vesture of thin, bright
silk. She knelt before the fire and looked out into the room.
The light fell softly, but with clear radiance, through shades
of yellow and blue paper, and the room, which was set with one
or two sofas resembling grassy mounds in their lack of shape,
looked unusually large and quiet. Mary was led to think of the
heights of a Sussex down, and the swelling green circle of some
camp of ancient warriors. The moonlight would be falling there
so peacefully now, and she could fancy the rough pathway of silver
upon the wrinkled skin of the sea.</p>

<p>"And here we are," she said, half aloud, half satirically, yet
with evident pride, "talking about art."</p>

<p>She pulled a basket containing balls of differently colored wools
and a pair of stockings which needed darning towards her, and
began to set her fingers to work; while her mind, reflecting the
lassitude of her body, went on perversely, conjuring up visions
of solitude and quiet, and she pictured herself laying aside her
knitting and walking out on to the down, and hearing nothing but
the sheep cropping the grass close to the roots, while the shadows
of the little trees moved very slightly this way and that in the
moonlight, as the breeze went through them. But she was perfectly
conscious of her present situation, and derived some pleasure
from the reflection that she could rejoice equally in solitude,
and in the presence of the many very different people who were
now making their way, by divers paths, across London to the spot
where she was sitting.</p>

<p>As she ran her needle in and out of the wool, she thought of
the various stages in her own life which made her present position
seem the culmination of successive miracles. She thought of her
clerical father in his country parsonage, and of her mother’s
death, and of her own determination to obtain education, and of
her college life, which had merged, not so very long ago, in the
wonderful maze of London, which still seemed to her, in spite
of her constitutional level-headedness, like a vast electric light,
casting radiance upon the myriads of men and women who crowded
round it. And here she was at the very center of it all, that
center which was constantly in the minds of people in remote Canadian
forests and on the plains of India, when their thoughts turned
to England. The nine mellow strokes, by which she was now apprised
of the hour, were a message from the great clock at Westminster
itself. As the last of them died away, there was a firm knocking
on her own door, and she rose and opened it. She returned to the
room, with a look of steady pleasure in her eyes, and she was
talking to Ralph Denham, who followed her.</p>

<p>"Alone?" he said, as if he were pleasantly surprised by that
fact.</p>

<p>"I am sometimes alone," she replied.</p>

<p>"But you expect a great many people," he added, looking round
him. "It’s like a room on the stage. Who is it to-night?"</p>

<p>"William Rodney, upon the Elizabethan use of metaphor. I expect
a good solid paper, with plenty of quotations from the classics."</p>

<p>Ralph warmed his hands at the fire, which was flapping bravely
in the grate, while Mary took up her stocking again.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are the only woman in London who darns her own
stockings," he observed.</p>

<p>"I’m only one of a great many thousands really," she replied,
"though I must admit that I was thinking myself very remarkable
when you came in. And now that you’re here I don’t think myself
remarkable at all. How horrid of you! But I’m afraid you’re much
more remarkable than I am. You’ve done much more than I’ve done."</p>

<p>"If that’s your standard, you’ve nothing to be proud of," said
Ralph grimly.</p>

<p>"Well, I must reflect with Emerson that it’s being and not doing
that matters," she continued.</p>

<p>"Emerson?" Ralph exclaimed, with derision. "You don’t mean to
say you read Emerson?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it wasn’t Emerson; but why shouldn’t I read Emerson?"
she asked, with a tinge of anxiety.</p>

<p>"There’s no reason that I know of. It’s the combination that’s
odd&mdash;books and stockings. The combination is very odd." But it
seemed to recommend itself to him. Mary gave a little laugh, expressive
of happiness, and the particular stitches that she was now putting
into her work appeared to her to be done with singular grace and
felicity. She held out the stocking and looked at it approvingly.</p>

<p>"You always say that," she said. "I assure you it’s a common
‘combination,’ as you call it, in the houses of the clergy. The
only thing that’s odd about me is that I enjoy them both &mdash;Emerson
and the stocking."</p>

<p>A knock was heard, and Ralph exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Damn those people! I wish they weren’t coming!"</p>

<p>"It’s only Mr. Turner, on the floor below," said Mary, and she
felt grateful to Mr. Turner for having alarmed Ralph, and for
having given a false alarm.</p>

<p>"Will there be a crowd?" Ralph asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>"There’ll be the Morrises and the Crashaws, and Dick Osborne,
and Septimus, and all that set. Katharine Hilbery is coming, by
the way, so William Rodney told me."</p>

<p>"Katharine Hilbery!" Ralph exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You know her?" Mary asked, with some surprise.</p>

<p>"I went to a tea-party at her house."</p>

<p>Mary pressed him to tell her all about it, and Ralph was not
at all unwilling to exhibit proofs of the extent of his knowledge.
He described the scene with certain additions and exaggerations
which interested Mary very much.</p>

<p>"But, in spite of what you say, I do admire her," she said. "I’ve
only seen her once or twice, but she seems to me to be what one
calls a ‘personality.’"</p>

<p>"I didn’t mean to abuse her. I only felt that she wasn’t very
sympathetic to me."</p>

<p>"They say she’s going to marry that queer creature Rodney."</p>

<p>"Marry Rodney? Then she must be more deluded than I thought her."</p>

<p>"Now that’s my door, all right," Mary exclaimed, carefully putting
her wools away, as a succession of knocks reverberated unnecessarily,
accompanied by a sound of people stamping their feet and laughing.
A moment later the room was full of young men and women, who came
in with a peculiar look of expectation, exclaimed "Oh!" when they
saw Denham, and then stood still, gaping rather foolishly.</p>

<p>The room very soon contained between twenty and thirty people,
who found seats for the most part upon the floor, occupying the
mattresses, and hunching themselves together into triangular shapes.
They were all young and some of them seemed to make a protest
by their hair and dress, and something somber and truculent in
the expression of their faces, against the more normal type, who
would have passed unnoticed in an omnibus or an underground railway.
It was notable that the talk was confined to groups, and was,
at first, entirely spasmodic in character, and muttered in undertones
as if the speakers were suspicious of their fellow-guests.</p>

<p>Katharine Hilbery came in rather late, and took up a position
on the floor, with her back against the wall. She looked round
quickly, recognized about half a dozen people, to whom she nodded,
but failed to see Ralph, or, if so, had already forgotten to attach
any name to him. But in a second these heterogeneous elements
were all united by the voice of Mr. Rodney, who suddenly strode
up to the table, and began very rapidly in high-strained tones:</p>

<p>"In undertaking to speak of the Elizabethan use of metaphor in
poetry&mdash;"</p>

<p>All the different heads swung slightly or steadied themselves
into a position in which they could gaze straight at the speaker’s
face, and the same rather solemn expression was visible on all
of them. But, at the same time, even the faces that were most
exposed to view, and therefore most tautly under control, disclosed
a sudden impulsive tremor which, unless directly checked, would
have developed into an outburst of laughter. The first sight of
Mr. Rodney was irresistibly ludicrous. He was very red in the
face, whether from the cool November night or nervousness, and
every movement, from the way he wrung his hands to the way he
jerked his head to right and left, as though a vision drew him
now to the door, now to the window, bespoke his horrible discomfort
under the stare of so many eyes. He was scrupulously well dressed,
and a pearl in the center of his tie seemed to give him a touch
of aristocratic opulence. But the rather prominent eyes and the
impulsive stammering manner, which seemed to indicate a torrent
of ideas intermittently pressing for utterance and always checked
in their course by a clutch of nervousness, drew no pity, as in
the case of a more imposing personage, but a desire to laugh,
which was, however, entirely lacking in malice. Mr. Rodney was
evidently so painfully conscious of the oddity of his appearance,
and his very redness and the starts to which his body was liable
gave such proof of his own discomfort, that there was something
endearing in this ridiculous susceptibility, although most people
would probably have echoed Denham’s private exclamation, "Fancy
marrying a creature like that!"</p>

<p>His paper was carefully written out, but in spite of this precaution
Mr. Rodney managed to turn over two sheets instead of one, to
choose the wrong sentence where two were written together, and
to discover his own handwriting suddenly illegible. When he found
himself possessed of a coherent passage, he shook it at his audience
almost aggressively, and then fumbled for another. After a distressing
search a fresh discovery would be made, and produced in the same
way, until, by means of repeated attacks, he had stirred his audience
to a degree of animation quite remarkable in these gatherings.
Whether they were stirred by his enthusiasm for poetry or by the
contortions which a human being was going through for their benefit,
it would be hard to say. At length Mr. Rodney sat down impulsively
in the middle of a sentence, and, after a pause of bewilderment,
the audience expressed its relief at being able to laugh aloud
in a decided outburst of applause.</p>

<p>Mr. Rodney acknowledged this with a wild glance round him, and,
instead of waiting to answer questions, he jumped up, thrust himself
through the seated bodies into the corner where Katharine was
sitting, and exclaimed, very audibly:</p>

<p>"Well, Katharine, I hope I’ve made a big enough fool of myself
even for you! It was terrible! terrible! terrible!"</p>

<p>"Hush! You must answer their questions," Katharine whispered,
desiring, at all costs, to keep him quiet. Oddly enough, when
the speaker was no longer in front of them, there seemed to be
much that was suggestive in what he had said. At any rate, a pale-faced
young man with sad eyes was already on his feet, delivering an
accurately worded speech with perfect composure. William Rodney
listened with a curious lifting of his upper lip, although his
face was still quivering slightly with emotion.</p>

<p>"Idiot!" he whispered. "He’s misunderstood every word I said!"</p>

<p>"Well then, answer him," Katharine whispered back.</p>

<p>"No, I shan’t! They’d only laugh at me. Why did I let you persuade
me that these sort of people care for literature?" he continued.</p>

<p>There was much to be said both for and against Mr. Rodney’s paper.
It had been crammed with assertions that such-and-such passages,
taken liberally from English, French, and Italian, are the supreme
pearls of literature. Further, he was fond of using metaphors
which, compounded in the study, were apt to sound either cramped
or out of place as he delivered them in fragments. Literature
was a fresh garland of spring flowers, he said, in which yew-berries
and the purple nightshade mingled with the various tints of the
anemone; and somehow or other this garland encircled marble brows.
He had read very badly some very beautiful quotations. But through
his manner and his confusion of language there had emerged some
passion of feeling which, as he spoke, formed in the majority
of the audience a little picture or an idea which each now was
eager to give expression to. Most of the people there proposed
to spend their lives in the practice either of writing or painting,
and merely by looking at them it could be seen that, as they listened
to Mr. Purvis first, and then to Mr. Greenhalgh, they were seeing
something done by these gentlemen to a possession which they thought
to be their own. One person after another rose, and, as with an
ill-balanced axe, attempted to hew out his conception of art a
little more clearly, and sat down with the feeling that, for some
reason which he could not grasp, his strokes had gone awry. As
they sat down they turned almost invariably to the person sitting
next them, and rectified and continued what they had just said
in public. Before long, therefore, the groups on the mattresses
and the groups on the chairs were all in communication with each
other, and Mary Datchet, who had begun to darn stockings again,
stooped down and remarked to Ralph:</p>

<p>"That was what I call a first-rate paper."</p>

<p>Both of them instinctively turned their eyes in the direction
of the reader of the paper. He was lying back against the wall,
with his eyes apparently shut, and his chin sunk upon his collar.
Katharine was turning over the pages of his manuscript as if she
were looking for some passage that had particularly struck her,
and had a difficulty in finding it.</p>

<p>"Let’s go and tell him how much we liked it," said Mary, thus
suggesting an action which Ralph was anxious to take, though without
her he would have been too proud to do it, for he suspected that
he had more interest in Katharine than she had in him.</p>

<p>"That was a very interesting paper," Mary began, without any
shyness, seating herself on the floor opposite to Rodney and Katharine.
"Will you lend me the manuscript to read in peace?"</p>

<p>Rodney, who had opened his eyes on their approach, regarded her
for a moment in suspicious silence.</p>

<p>"Do you say that merely to disguise the fact of my ridiculous
failure?"  he asked.</p>

<p>Katharine looked up from her reading with a smile.</p>

<p>"He says he doesn’t mind what we think of him," she remarked.
"He says we don’t care a rap for art of any kind."</p>

<p>"I asked her to pity me, and she teases me!" Rodney exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I don’t intend to pity you, Mr. Rodney," Mary remarked, kindly,
but firmly. "When a paper’s a failure, nobody says anything, whereas
now, just listen to them!"</p>

<p>The sound, which filled the room, with its hurry of short syllables,
its sudden pauses, and its sudden attacks, might be compared to
some animal hubbub, frantic and inarticulate.</p>

<p>"D’you think that’s all about my paper?" Rodney inquired, after
a moment’s attention, with a distinct brightening of expression.</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Mary. "It was a very suggestive paper."</p>

<p>She turned to Denham for confirmation, and he corroborated her.</p>

<p>"It’s the ten minutes after a paper is read that proves whether
it’s been a success or not," he said. "If I were you, Rodney,
I should be very pleased with myself."</p>

<p>This commendation seemed to comfort Mr. Rodney completely, and
he began to bethink him of all the passages in his paper which
deserved to be called "suggestive."</p>

<p>"Did you agree at all, Denham, with what I said about Shakespeare’s
later use of imagery? I’m afraid I didn’t altogether make my meaning
plain."</p>

<p>Here he gathered himself together, and by means of a series of
frog-like jerks, succeeded in bringing himself close to Denham.</p>

<p>Denham answered him with the brevity which is the result of having
another sentence in the mind to be addressed to another person.
He wished to say to Katharine: "Did you remember to get that picture
glazed before your aunt came to dinner?" but, besides having to
answer Rodney, he was not sure that the remark, with its assertion
of intimacy, would not strike Katharine as impertinent. She was
listening to what some one in another group was saying. Rodney,
meanwhile, was talking about the Elizabethan dramatists.</p>

<p>He was a curious-looking man since, upon first sight, especially
if he chanced to be talking with animation, he appeared, in some
way, ridiculous; but, next moment, in repose, his face, with its
large nose, thin cheeks and lips expressing the utmost sensibility,
somehow recalled a Roman head bound with laurel, cut upon a circle
of semi-transparent reddish stone. It had dignity and character.
By profession a clerk in a Government office, he was one of those
martyred spirits to whom literature is at once a source of divine
joy and of almost intolerable irritation. Not content to rest
in their love of it, they must attempt to practise it themselves,
and they are generally endowed with very little facility in composition.
They condemn whatever they produce. Moreover, the violence of
their feelings is such that they seldom meet with adequate sympathy,
and being rendered very sensitive by their cultivated perceptions,
suffer constant slights both to their own persons and to the thing
they worship. But Rodney could never resist making trial of the
sympathies of any one who seemed favorably disposed, and Denham’s
praise had stimulated his very susceptible vanity.</p>

<p>"You remember the passage just before the death of the Duchess?"
he continued, edging still closer to Denham, and adjusting his
elbow and knee in an incredibly angular combination. Here, Katharine,
who had been cut off by these maneuvers from all communication
with the outer world, rose, and seated herself upon the window-sill,
where she was joined by Mary Datchet. The two young women could
thus survey the whole party. Denham looked after them, and made
as if he were tearing handfuls of grass up by the roots from the
carpet. But as it fell in accurately with his conception of life
that all one’s desires were bound to be frustrated, he concentrated
his mind upon literature, and determined, philosophically, to
get what he could out of that.</p>

<p>Katharine was pleasantly excited. A variety of courses was open
to her. She knew several people slightly, and at any moment one
of them might rise from the floor and come and speak to her; on
the other hand, she might select somebody for herself, or she
might strike into Rodney’s discourse, to which she was intermittently
attentive. She was conscious of Mary’s body beside her, but, at
the same time, the consciousness of being both of them women made
it unnecessary to speak to her. But Mary, feeling, as she had
said, that Katharine was a "personality," wished so much to speak
to her that in a few moments she did.</p>

<p>"They’re exactly like a flock of sheep, aren’t they?" she said,
referring to the noise that rose from the scattered bodies beneath
her.</p>

<p>Katharine turned and smiled.</p>

<p>"I wonder what they’re making such a noise about?" she said.</p>

<p>"The Elizabethans, I suppose."</p>

<p>"No, I don’t think it’s got anything to do with the Elizabethans.
There! Didn’t you hear them say, ‘Insurance Bill’?"</p>

<p>"I wonder why men always talk about politics?" Mary speculated.
"I suppose, if we had votes, we should, too."</p>

<p>"I dare say we should. And you spend your life in getting us
votes, don’t you?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Mary, stoutly. "From ten to six every day I’m at
it."</p>

<p>Katharine looked at Ralph Denham, who was now pounding his way
through the metaphysics of metaphor with Rodney, and was reminded
of his talk that Sunday afternoon. She connected him vaguely with
Mary.</p>

<p>"I suppose you’re one of the people who think we should all have
professions," she said, rather distantly, as if feeling her way
among the phantoms of an unknown world.</p>

<p>"Oh dear no," said Mary at once.</p>

<p>"Well, I think I do," Katharine continued, with half a sigh.
"You will always be able to say that you’ve done something, whereas,
in a crowd like this, I feel rather melancholy."</p>

<p>"In a crowd? Why in a crowd?" Mary asked, deepening the two lines
between her eyes, and hoisting herself nearer to Katharine upon
the window-sill.</p>

<p>"Don’t you see how many different things these people care about?
And I want to beat them down &mdash;I only mean," she corrected
herself, "that I want to assert myself, and it’s difficult, if
one hasn’t a profession."</p>

<p>Mary smiled, thinking that to beat people down was a process
that should present no difficulty to Miss Katharine Hilbery. They
knew each other so slightly that the beginning of intimacy, which
Katharine seemed to initiate by talking about herself, had something
solemn in it, and they were silent, as if to decide whether to
proceed or not. They tested the ground.</p>

<p>"Ah, but I want to trample upon their prostrate bodies!" Katharine
announced, a moment later, with a laugh, as if at the train of
thought which had led her to this conclusion.</p>

<p>"One doesn’t necessarily trample upon people’s bodies because
one runs an office," Mary remarked.</p>

<p>"No. Perhaps not," Katharine replied. The conversation lapsed,
and Mary saw Katharine looking out into the room rather moodily
with closed lips, the desire to talk about herself or to initiate
a friendship having, apparently, left her. Mary was struck by
her capacity for being thus easily silent, and occupied with her
own thoughts. It was a habit that spoke of loneliness and a mind
thinking for itself. When Katharine remained silent Mary was slightly
embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Yes, they’re very like sheep," she repeated, foolishly.</p>

<p>"And yet they are very clever&mdash;at least," Katharine added, "I
suppose they have all read Webster."</p>

<p>"Surely you don’t think that a proof of cleverness? I’ve read
Webster, I’ve read Ben Jonson, but I don’t think myself clever&mdash;not
exactly, at least."</p>

<p>"I think you must be very clever," Katharine observed.</p>

<p>"Why? Because I run an office?"</p>

<p>"I wasn’t thinking of that. I was thinking how you live alone
in this room, and have parties."</p>

<p>Mary reflected for a second.</p>

<p>"It means, chiefly, a power of being disagreeable to one’s own
family, I think. I have that, perhaps. I didn’t want to live at
home, and I told my father. He didn’t like it.... But then I have
a sister, and you haven’t, have you?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven’t any sisters."</p>

<p>"You are writing a life of your grandfather?" Mary pursued.</p>

<p>Katharine seemed instantly to be confronted by some familiar
thought from which she wished to escape. She replied, "Yes, I
am helping my mother," in such a way that Mary felt herself baffled,
and put back again into the position in which she had been at
the beginning of their talk. It seemed to her that Katharine possessed
a curious power of drawing near and receding, which sent alternate
emotions through her far more quickly than was usual, and kept
her in a condition of curious alertness. Desiring to classify
her, Mary bethought her of the convenient term "egoist."</p>

<p>"She’s an egoist," she said to herself, and stored that word
up to give to Ralph one day when, as it would certainly fall out,
they were discussing Miss Hilbery.</p>

<p>"Heavens, what a mess there’ll be to-morrow morning!" Katharine
exclaimed. "I hope you don’t sleep in this room, Miss Datchet?"</p>

<p>Mary laughed.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" Katharine demanded.</p>

<p>"I won’t tell you."</p>

<p>"Let me guess. You were laughing because you thought I’d changed
the conversation?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Because you think&mdash;" She paused.</p>

<p>"If you want to know, I was laughing at the way you said Miss
Datchet."</p>

<p>"Mary, then. Mary, Mary, Mary."</p>

<p>So saying, Katharine drew back the curtain in order, perhaps,
to conceal the momentary flush of pleasure which is caused by
coming perceptibly nearer to another person.</p>

<p>"Mary Datchet," said Mary. "It’s not such an imposing name as
Katharine Hilbery, I’m afraid."</p>

<p>They both looked out of the window, first up at the hard silver
moon, stationary among a hurry of little grey-blue clouds, and
then down upon the roofs of London, with all their upright chimneys,
and then below them at the empty moonlit pavement of the street,
upon which the joint of each paving-stone was clearly marked out.
Mary then saw Katharine raise her eyes again to the moon, with
a contemplative look in them, as though she were setting that
moon against the moon of other nights, held in memory. Some one
in the room behind them made a joke about star-gazing, which destroyed
their pleasure in it, and they looked back into the room again.</p>

<p>Ralph had been watching for this moment, and he instantly produced
his sentence.</p>

<p>"I wonder, Miss Hilbery, whether you remembered to get that picture
glazed?" His voice showed that the question was one that had been
prepared.</p>

<p>"Oh, you idiot!" Mary exclaimed, very nearly aloud, with a sense
that Ralph had said something very stupid. So, after three lessons
in Latin grammar, one might correct a fellow student, whose knowledge
did not embrace the ablative of "mensa."</p>

<p>"Picture&mdash;what picture?" Katharine asked. "Oh, at home, you mean&mdash;that
Sunday afternoon. Was it the day Mr. Fortescue came? Yes, I think
I remembered it."</p>

<p>The three of them stood for a moment awkwardly silent, and then
Mary left them in order to see that the great pitcher of coffee
was properly handled, for beneath all her education she preserved
the anxieties of one who owns china.</p>

<p>Ralph could think of nothing further to say; but could one have
stripped off his mask of flesh, one would have seen that his will-power
was rigidly set upon a single object&mdash;that Miss Hilbery should
obey him. He wished her to stay there until, by some measures
not yet apparent to him, he had conquered her interest. These
states of mind transmit themselves very often without the use
of language, and it was evident to Katharine that this young man
had fixed his mind upon her. She instantly recalled her first
impressions of him, and saw herself again proffering family relics.
She reverted to the state of mind in which he had left her that
Sunday afternoon. She supposed that he judged her very severely.
She argued naturally that, if this were the case, the burden of
the conversation should rest with him. But she submitted so far
as to stand perfectly still, her eyes upon the opposite wall,
and her lips very nearly closed, though the desire to laugh stirred
them slightly.</p>

<p>"You know the names of the stars, I suppose?" Denham remarked,
and from the tone of his voice one might have thought that he
grudged Katharine the knowledge he attributed to her.</p>

<p>She kept her voice steady with some difficulty.</p>

<p>"I know how to find the Pole star if I’m lost."</p>

<p>"I don’t suppose that often happens to you."</p>

<p>"No. Nothing interesting ever happens to me," she said.</p>

<p>"I think you make a system of saying disagreeable things, Miss
Hilbery,"  he broke out, again going further than he meant to.
"I suppose it’s one of the characteristics of your class. They
never talk seriously to their inferiors."</p>

<p>Whether it was that they were meeting on neutral ground to-night,
or whether the carelessness of an old grey coat that Denham wore
gave an ease to his bearing that he lacked in conventional dress,
Katharine certainly felt no impulse to consider him outside the
particular set in which she lived.</p>

<p>"In what sense are you my inferior?" she asked, looking at him
gravely, as though honestly searching for his meaning. The look
gave him great pleasure. For the first time he felt himself on
perfectly equal terms with a woman whom he wished to think well
of him, although he could not have explained why her opinion of
him mattered one way or another. Perhaps, after all, he only wanted
to have something of her to take home to think about. But he was
not destined to profit by his advantage.</p>

<p>"I don’t think I understand what you mean," Katharine repeated,
and then she was obliged to stop and answer some one who wished
to know whether she would buy a ticket for an opera from them,
at a reduction. Indeed, the temper of the meeting was now unfavorable
to separate conversation; it had become rather debauched and hilarious,
and people who scarcely knew each other were making use of Christian
names with apparent cordiality, and had reached that kind of gay
tolerance and general friendliness which human beings in England
only attain after sitting together for three hours or so, and
the first cold blast in the air of the street freezes them into
isolation once more. Cloaks were being flung round the shoulders,
hats swiftly pinned to the head; and Denham had the mortification
of seeing Katharine helped to prepare herself by the ridiculous
Rodney. It was not the convention of the meeting to say good-bye,
or necessarily even to nod to the person with whom one was talking;
but, nevertheless, Denham was disappointed by the completeness
with which Katharine parted from him, without any attempt to finish
her sentence. She left with Rodney.</p>
