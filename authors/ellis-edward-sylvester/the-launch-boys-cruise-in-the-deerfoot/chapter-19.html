<p>Having convinced themselves that the man in gray was near at
hand, the next question Alvin and Chester asked themselves was
whether he knew of <em>their</em> proximity. It would seem not,
for they had moved with the silence of shadows, and spoken in
the most guarded of undertones. Moreover, it was not to be supposed
that he would smoke a cigar, knowing the liability of betraying
himself, just as he had done. Further, there was the danger of
the glowing end catching the eye of anyone in the vicinity. The
youths peered here and there in the obscurity in quest of a tiny
torch, but failed to see it.</p>

<p>While speculating over the situation an unexpected shift took
place. Chester laid his hand on the arm of his comrade and whispered:</p>

<p>"Look out on the water!"</p>

<p>A point of light glowed like a tiny star from a spot directly
opposite, but quite a way from shore. It was of a neutral or yellow
color, and the reflection of the rays showed a few feet from where
it shone above the surface. The gleaming speck, however, was too
small to tell anything more.</p>

<p>"I believe that's on the <em>Deerfoot</em>!" whispered Chester.</p>

<p>"It may be, but it's on the other side of the inlet; we shall
not learn anything more while standing here."</p>

<p>A new problem was thus presented. They could stay where they
were until daylight told them the truth, go back to Uncle Ben's
house and sleep in a comfortable bed, or pick their way through
the wood and darkness to the other side of the water. After a
few minutes' consultation they decided to follow the last course.</p>

<p>Once nigh enough to the launch to touch it with outstretched
hand they would have no trouble in identifying it, no matter how
profound the gloom. While each youth saw the imprudence of the
action, he was impelled by the dread that the thieves would give
them the slip, and be almost beyond tracing within the following
few hours. If they had run into this place for shelter, there
was no guessing how long they would stay.</p>

<p>The task before the lads was formidable. They did not know the
width of the inlet around whose head they must thread their course
in order to reach the point where the <em>Deerfoot</em> or possibly
some other motor boat was lying. The distance might be brief or
prove too great to be traversed during the night. None the less
they decided to try it.</p>

<p>The star still shone a little above the silent surface which
was as smooth as a mirror. The light did not seem to be far off&mdash;a
fact which led our young friends to believe they would not have
to walk far to reach their destination.</p>

<p>The immediate cause for misgiving was the man with the cigar.
The most careful snuffing failed to tell the direction from which
the vapor floated, and not a breath of air stirred the stillness.
Whether the youths moving eastward would be going toward or from
him could not be guessed. They could only trust to providence.</p>

<p>"The slightest sound will give us away," said Alvin as he took
the lead. "Keep so near that you can touch me with your hand;
I'll feel every inch of the way."</p>

<p>It should not be long before they would be far enough from the
man in gray to move with more freedom. The plan was to make a
circuit around the head of the inlet and come back to the spot
where the <em>Deerfoot</em> nestled under the wooded bank. How
long it would require to complete this semi-circle remained to
be seen.</p>

<p>When twenty minutes had gone by and they had progressed several
rods, Alvin paused and said in his guarded undertone:</p>

<p>"I don't smell the cigar; do you?"</p>

<p>Chester called his nose into action and replied:</p>

<p>"I don't detect any odor."</p>

<p>"That means we have got away from him."</p>

<p>"Or that he has finished his cigar and thrown away the stump.
Push on."</p>

<p>To avoid mishap, they kept several yards from the water. The
task was so hard that it would have been impossible but for the
help given by the moon. The sky had cleared considerably, so that
the dim light shone at brief intervals upon the water. Another
blessing was appreciated by the venturesome youths. The pine woods
were free from briers and undergrowth, the ground being soft,
spongy and dry under their feet, because of the cones and spines
which had accumulated for many and many a year. Still again, the
inlet had no tributaries&mdash;at any rate the boys did not come upon
any, so they were not troubled in that respect. It was simply
a cove whose sole supply of water came from the broad Sheepscot.</p>

<p>Such being the favoring conditions, Alvin and Chester made better
progress than either expected when setting out. Now and then Alvin
led the way to the water's edge in quest of the beacon which had
served them so well thus far. It still gleamed with a calm, unwinking
clearness like the point of an incandescent light.</p>

<p>A gratifying discovery came sooner than the youths expected&mdash;they
were turning the head of the inlet and coming back on the other
side from the shore first reached. If all went well they ought
to arrive at the right spot within the next half hour. They ran
against an unimportant difficulty, however. A vigorous growth
of underbrush clogged their progress, but having left the mysterious
stranger behind, they felt no need of further care with their
footsteps.</p>

<p>It was yet comparatively early in the night when they completed
the broad half circle and came opposite the point of their first
arrival. The occasional clearing of the moon had been of much
help, and they had every reason to be satisfied with their progress.
But before coming to a pause, they were puzzled by a discovery
for which at first they could not account.</p>

<p>The gleaming point that had served as a guide was nowhere near
them. It seemed like an ignis fatuus that recedes as the traveller
tries to approach it. So far as the lads could judge they were
no closer to the light than before.</p>

<p>"That's the queerest thing I ever saw," said Alvin, as he and
his companion stood on the edge of the wood. "I thought we should
run right against the boat, and now there is no chance of doing
so."</p>

<p>"It must have crossed to the other shore while we were passing
round the head of the inlet," suggested Chester, as much perplexed
as his chum.</p>

<p>"Then we shall have to turn back."</p>

<p>"And have it give us the slip again. That can't be the explanation,
Alvin; we should have heard the engine in the stillness. Ah! I
have it! The <em>Deerfoot</em> is not near either bank, but anchored
in the middle of the cove or beside a small island."</p>

<p>This obviously was the explanation, but it did not improve the
situation, so far as the searchers were concerned. With the partial
illumination given now and then by the moon they could not catch
the faintest outlines of the boat. It might have been a dozen
miles away.</p>

<p>"It looks as if we were up against it," remarked Alvin, with
a sigh. "We shall have to wait until daylight and may as well
go back to Uncle Ben's."</p>

<p>Chester was silent for a minute or two. He was turning over a
project in his mind.</p>

<p>"The boat can't be far off," he said. "What do you say to my
taking off my clothing and swimming out to it?"</p>

<p>The proposal struck Alvin dumb at first. His friend added:</p>

<p>"It will be easy; it won't take me long to go there and back."</p>

<p>"Suppose you are seen?"</p>

<p>"I have no fear of that; they won't be expecting anything of
the kind and I shall learn something worth while."</p>

<p>"I won't agree to it," replied Alvin decisively; "it may look
simple to you, but there is more danger than you suspect. No,
give it up. It is <em>my</em> boat and if anyone chose to risk
his life to recover it he should be myself, and I'll be hanged
if <em>I'll</em> try it."</p>

<p>"All right; you are the Captain and I am only second mate, but
it grieves me to have you turn down my proposition. Sh! you heard
that?"</p>

<p>From the direction of the launch came the sound of a sneeze.
In the profound stillness there was no mistaking the nature of
the noise.</p>

<p>"I wonder if our friend is catching cold," was the whimsical
remark of Chester; "it sounds that way," he added as the person,
whoever he was, sneezed a second, third and fourth time in quick
succession and then rested.</p>

<p>"Suppose I call to him to be careful," suggested Chester.</p>

<p>"Do so if you choose, but it strikes me that we are the ones
who need to be careful."</p>

<p>"Hello! the light is gone."</p>

<p>Such was the fact. Not the slightest illumination pierced the
gloom that was now on every hand.</p>

<p>"I guess they have gone to bed," remarked Chester, "and that
is what we might as well do. The weather is so mild that we can
sleep on the soft carpet in the woods without risk; it's a long
walk to Uncle Ben's and we want to be on hand at the first peep
of day."</p>

<p>"I can't say that I fancy spending the night out of doors."</p>

<p>"It will be easy to start a fire."</p>

<p>"And have it seen by those on the boat."</p>

<p>"We can go so far back that there will be no danger of that."</p>

<p>"What about breakfast?"</p>

<p>"We can reach Uncle Ben's in time for that."</p>

<p>"I have been suspecting, Chester, for the last hour that we have
been making fools of ourselves and now I haven't any doubt of
it."</p>

<p>"I hadn't from the first. Hist! do you hear that?"</p>
