<P>
That September was a month of golden mists and purple
hazes at Four Winds Harbor--a month of sun-steeped days
and of nights that were swimming in moonlight, or
pulsating with stars.  No storm marred it, no rough
wind blew.  Anne and Gilbert put their nest in order,
rambled on the shores, sailed on the harbor, drove
about Four Winds and the Glen, or through the ferny,
sequestered roads of the woods around the harbor head;
in short, had such a honeymoon as any lovers in the
world might have envied them.
<P>
"If life were to stop short just now it would still
have been richly worth while, just for the sake of
these past four weeks, wouldn't it?" said Anne.  "I
don't suppose we will ever have four such perfect weeks
again--but we've HAD them.  Everything--wind, weather,
folks, house of dreams--has conspired to make our
honeymoon delightful.  There hasn't even been a rainy
day since we came here."
<P>
"And we haven't quarrelled once," teased Gilbert.
<P>
"Well, `that's a pleasure all the greater for being
deferred,'" quoted Anne.  "I'm so glad we decided to
spend our honeymoon here.  Our memories of it will
always belong here, in our house of dreams, instead of
being scattered about in strange places."
<P>
There was a certain tang of romance and adventure in
the atmosphere of their new home which Anne had never
found in Avonlea.  There, although she had lived in
sight of the sea, it had not entered intimately into
her life.  In Four Winds it surrounded her and called
to her constantly.  From every window of her new home
she saw some varying aspect of it.  Its haunting murmur
was ever in her ears.  Vessels sailed up the harbor
every day to the wharf at the Glen, or sailed out
again through the sunset, bound for ports that might be
half way round the globe.  Fishing boats went
white-winged down the channel in the mornings, and
returned laden in the evenings.  Sailors and
fisher-folk travelled the red, winding harbor roads,
light-hearted and content.  There was always a certain
sense of things going to happen--of adventures and
farings-forth.  The ways of Four Winds were less staid
and settled and grooved than those of Avonlea; winds of
change blew over them; the sea called ever to the
dwellers on shore, and even those who might not answer
its call felt the thrill and unrest and mystery and
possibilities of it.
<P>
"I understand now why some men must go to sea," said
Anne.  "That desire which comes to us all at times--`to
sail beyond the bourne of sunset'--must be very
imperious when it is born in you.  I don't wonder
Captain Jim ran away because of it.  I never see a ship
sailing out of the channel, or a gull soaring over the
sand-bar, without wishing I were on board the ship or
had wings, not like a dove `to fly away and be at
rest,' but like a gull, to sweep out into the very
heart of a storm."
<P>
"You'll stay right here with me, Anne-girl," said
Gilbert lazily.  "I won't have you flying away from me
into the hearts of storms."
<P>
They were sitting on their red sand-stone doorstep in
the late afternoon.  Great tranquillities were all
about them in land and sea and sky.  Silvery gulls were
soaring over them.  The horizons were laced with long
trails of frail, pinkish clouds.  The hushed air was
threaded with a murmurous refrain of minstrel winds and
waves.  Pale asters were blowing in the sere and misty
meadows between them and the harbor.
<P>
"Doctors who have to be up all night waiting on sick
folk don't feel very adventurous, I suppose," Anne
said indulgently.  "If you had had a good sleep last
night, Gilbert, you'd be as ready as I am for a flight
of imagination."
<P>
"I did good work last night, Anne," said Gilbert
quietly.  "Under God, I saved a life.  This is the
first time I could ever really claim that.  In other
cases I may have helped; but, Anne, if I had not stayed
at Allonby's last night and fought death hand to hand,
that woman would have died before morning.  I tried an
experiment that was certainly never tried in Four Winds
before.  I doubt if it was ever tried anywhere before
outside of a hospital.  It was a new thing in Kingsport
hospital last winter.  I could never have dared try it
here if I had not been absolutely certain that there
was no other chance.  I risked it--and it succeeded. 
As a result, a good wife and mother is saved for long
years of happiness and usefulness.  As I drove home
this morning, while the sun was rising over the harbor,
I thanked God that I had chosen the profession I did. 
I had fought a good fight and won--think of it, Anne,
WON, against the Great Destroyer.  It's what I dreamed
of doing long ago when we talked together of what we
wanted to do in life.  That dream of mine came true
this morning."
<P>
"Was that the only one of your dreams that has come
true?" asked Anne, who knew perfectly well what the
substance of his answer would be, but wanted to hear it
again.
<P>
"YOU know, Anne-girl," said Gilbert, smiling into her
eyes.  At that moment there were certainly two
perfectly happy people sitting on the doorstep of a
little white house on the Four Winds Harbor shore.
<P>
Presently Gilbert said, with a change of tone, "Do I or
do I not see a full-rigged ship sailing up our lane?"
<P>
Anne looked and sprang up.
<P>
"That must be either Miss Cornelia Bryant or Mrs. Moore
coming to call," she said.
<P>
"I'm going into the office, and if it is Miss Cornelia
I warn you that I'll eavesdrop," said Gilbert.  "From
all I've heard regarding Miss Cornelia I conclude that
her conversation will not be dull, to say the least."
<P>
"It may be Mrs. Moore."
<P>
"I don't think Mrs. Moore is built on those lines.  I
saw her working in her garden the other day, and,
though I was too far away to see clearly, I thought she
was rather slender.  She doesn't seem very socially
inclined when she has never called on you yet, although
she's your nearest neighbor."
<P>
"She can't be like Mrs. Lynde, after all, or curiosity
would have brought her," said Anne.  "This caller is,
I think, Miss Cornelia."
<P>
Miss Cornelia it was; moreover, Miss Cornelia had not
come to make any brief and fashionable wedding call. 
She had her work under her arm in a substantial parcel,
and when Anne asked her to stay she promptly took off
her capacious sun-hat, which had been held on her head,
despite irreverent September breezes, by a tight
elastic band under her hard little knob of fair hair. 
No hat pins for Miss Cornelia, an it please ye! 
Elastic bands had been good enough for her mother and
they were good enough for HER.  She had a fresh, round,
pink-and-white face, and jolly brown eyes.  She did not
look in the least like the traditional old maid, and
there was something in her expression which won Anne
instantly.  With her old instinctive quickness to
discern kindred spirits she knew she was going to like
Miss Cornelia, in spite of uncertain oddities of
opinion, and certain oddities of attire.
<P>
Nobody but Miss Cornelia would have come to make a call
arrayed in a striped blue-and-white apron and a wrapper
of chocolate print, with a design of huge, pink roses
scattered over it.  And nobody but Miss Cornelia could
have looked dignified and suitably garbed in it.  Had
Miss Cornelia been entering a palace to call on a
prince's bride, she would have been just as dignified
and just as wholly mistress of the situation.  She
would have trailed her rose-spattered flounce over the
marble floors just as unconcernedly, and she would have
proceeded just as calmly to disabuse the mind of the
princess of any idea that the possession of a mere man,
be he prince or peasant, was anything to brag of.
<P>
"I've brought my work, Mrs. Blythe, dearie," she
remarked, unrolling some dainty material.  "I'm in a
hurry to get this done, and there isn't any time to
lose."
<P>
Anne looked in some surprise at the white garment
spread over Miss Cornelia's ample lap.  It was
certainly a baby's dress, and it was most beautifully
made, with tiny frills and tucks.  Miss Cornelia
adjusted her glasses and fell to embroidering with
exquisite stitches.
<P>
"This is for Mrs. Fred Proctor up at the Glen," she
announced.  "She's expecting her eighth baby any day
now, and not a stitch has she ready for it.  The other
seven have wore out all she made for the first, and
she's never had time or strength or spirit to make any
more.  That woman is a martyr, Mrs. Blythe, believe ME. 
When she married Fred Proctor _I_ knew how it would
turn out.  He was one of your wicked, fascinating men. 
After he got married he left off being fascinating and
just kept on being wicked.  He drinks and he neglects
his family.  Isn't that like a man?  I don't know how
Mrs. Proctor would ever keep her children decently
clothed if her neighbors didn't help her out."
<P>
As Anne was afterwards to learn, Miss Cornelia was the
only neighbor who troubled herself much about the
decency of the young Proctors.
<P>
"When I heard this eighth baby was coming I decided to
make some things for it," Miss Cornelia went on. 
"This is the last and I want to finish it today."
<P>
"It's certainly very pretty," said Anne.  "I'll get my
sewing and we'll have a little thimble party of two. 
You are a beautiful sewer, Miss Bryant."
<P>
"Yes, I'm the best sewer in these parts," said Miss
Cornelia in a matter-of-fact tone.  "I ought to be! 
Lord, I've done more of it than if I'd had a hundred
children of my own, believe ME!  I s'pose I'm a fool,
to be putting hand embroidery on this dress for an
eighth baby.  But, Lord, Mrs. Blythe, dearie, it isn't
to blame for being the eighth, and I kind of wished it
to have one real pretty dress, just as if it WAS
wanted.  Nobody's wanting the poor mite--so I put some
extra fuss on its little things just on that account."
<P>
"Any baby might be proud of that dress," said Anne,
feeling still more strongly that she was going to like
Miss Cornelia.
<P>
"I s'pose you've been thinking I was never coming to
call on you," resumed Miss Cornelia.  "But this is
harvest month, you know, and I've been busy--and a lot
of extra hands hanging round, eating more'n they work,
just like the men.  I'd have come yesterday, but I went
to Mrs. Roderick MacAllister's funeral.  At first I
thought my head was aching so badly I couldn't enjoy
myself if I did go.  But she was a hundred years old,
and I'd always promised myself that I'd go to her
funeral."
<P>
"Was it a successful function?" asked Anne, noticing
that the office door was ajar.
<P>
"What's that?  Oh, yes, it was a tremendous funeral. 
She had a very large connection.  There was over one
hundred and twenty carriages in the procession.  There
was one or two funny things happened.  I thought that
die I would to see old Joe Bradshaw, who is an infidel
and never darkens the door of a church, singing `Safe
in the Arms of Jesus' with great gusto and fervor.  He
glories in singing-- that's why he never misses a
funeral.  Poor Mrs. Bradshaw didn't look much like
singing--all wore out slaving.  Old Joe starts out once
in a while to buy her a present and brings home some
new kind of farm machinery.  Isn't that like a man? 
But what else would you expect of a man who never goes
to church, even a Methodist one?  I was real thankful
to see you and the young Doctor in the Presbyterian
church your first Sunday.  No doctor for me who isn't a
Presbyterian."
<P>
"We were in the Methodist church last Sunday evening,"
said Anne wickedly.
<P>
"Oh, I s'pose Dr. Blythe has to go to the Methodist
church once in a while or he wouldn't get the Methodist
practice."
<P>
"We liked the sermon very much," declared Anne boldly. 
"And I thought the Methodist minster's prayer was one
of the most beautiful I ever heard."
<P>
"Oh, I've no doubt he can pray.  I never heard anyone
make more beautiful prayers than old Simon Bentley, who
was always drunk, or hoping to be, and the drunker he
was the better he prayed."
<P>
"The Methodist minister is very fine looking," said
Anne, for the benefit of the office door.
<P>
"Yes, he's quite ornamental," agreed Miss Cornelia. 
"Oh, and VERY ladylike.  And he thinks that every girl
who looks at him falls in love with him--as if a
Methodist minister, wandering about like any Jew, was
such a prize!  If you and the young doctor take MY
advice, you won't have much to do with the Methodists. 
My motto is--if you ARE a Presbyterian, BE a
Presbyterian."
<P>
"Don't you think that Methodists go to heaven as well
as Presbyterians?" asked Anne smilelessly.
<P>
"That isn't for US to decide.  It's in higher hands
than ours," said Miss Cornelia solemnly.  "But I ain't
going to associate with them on earth whatever I may
have to do in heaven.  THIS Methodist minister isn't
married.  The last one they had was, and his wife was
the silliest, flightiest little thing I ever saw.  I
told her husband once that he should have waited till
she was grown up before he married her.  He said he
wanted to have the training of her.  Wasn't that like a
man?"
<P>
"It's rather hard to decide just when people ARE grown
up," laughed Anne.
<P>
"That's a true word, dearie.  Some are grown up when
they're born, and others ain't grown up when they're
eighty, believe ME. That same Mrs. Roderick I was
speaking of never grew up.  She was as foolish when she
was a hundred as when she was ten."
<P>
"Perhaps that was why she lived so long," suggested
Anne.
<P>
"Maybe 'twas.  _I_'d rather live fifty sensible years
than a hundred foolish ones."
<P>
"But just think what a dull world it would be if
everyone was sensible," pleaded Anne.
<P>
Miss Cornelia disdained any skirmish of flippant
epigram.
<P>
"Mrs. Roderick was a Milgrave, and the Milgraves never
had much sense.  Her nephew, Ebenezer Milgrave, used to
be insane for years.  He believed he was dead and used
to rage at his wife because she wouldn't bury him. 
_I_'d a-done it."
<P>
Miss Cornelia looked so grimly determined that Anne
could almost see her with a spade in her hand.
<P>
"Don't you know ANY good husbands, Miss Bryant?"
<P>
"Oh, yes, lots of them--over yonder," said Miss
Cornelia, waving her hand through the open window
towards the little graveyard of the church across the
harbor.
<P>
"But living--going about in the flesh?" persisted
Anne.
<P>
"Oh, there's a few, just to show that with God all
things are possible," acknowledged Miss Cornelia
reluctantly.  "I don't deny that an odd man here and
there, if he's caught young and trained up proper, and
if his mother has spanked him well beforehand, may turn
out a decent being.  YOUR husband, now, isn't so bad,
as men go, from all I hear.  I s'pose"--Miss Cornelia
looked sharply at Anne over her glasses--"you think
there's nobody like him in the world."
<P>
"There isn't," said Anne promptly.
<P>
"Ah, well, I heard another bride say that once,"
sighed Miss Cornelia.  "Jennie Dean thought when she
married that there wasn't anybody like HER husband in
the world.  And she was right--there wasn't!  And a
good thing, too, believe ME!  He led her an awful
life--and he was courting his second wife while Jennie
was dying.
<P>
Wasn't that like a man?  However, I hope YOUR
confidence will be better justified, dearie.  The young
doctor is taking real well.  I was afraid at first he
mightn't, for folks hereabouts have always thought old
Doctor Dave the only doctor in the world.  Doctor Dave
hadn't much tact, to be sure--he was always talking of
ropes in houses where someone had hanged himself.  But
folks forgot their hurt feelings when they had a pain
in their stomachs.  If he'd been a minister instead of
a doctor they'd never have forgiven him.  Soul-ache
doesn't worry folks near as much as stomach-ache. 
Seeing as we're both Presbyterians and no Methodists
around, will you tell me your candid opinion of OUR
minister?"
<P>
"Why--really--I--well," hesitated Anne.
<P>
Miss Cornelia nodded.
<P>
"Exactly.  I agree with you, dearie.  We made a mistake
when we called HIM.  His face just looks like one of
those long, narrow stones in the graveyard, doesn't it? 
`Sacred to the memory' ought to be written on his
forehead.  I shall never forget the first sermon he
preached after he came.  It was on the subject of
everyone doing what they were best fitted for--a very
good subject, of course; but such illustrations as he
used!  He said, `If you had a cow and an apple tree,
and if you tied the apple tree in your stable and
planted the cow in your orchard, with her legs up, how
much milk would you get from the apple tree, or how
many apples from the cow?'  Did you ever hear the like
in your born days, dearie?  I was so thankful there
were no Methodists there that day--they'd never have
been done hooting over it.  But what I dislike most in
him is his habit of agreeing with everybody, no matter
what is said.  If you said to him, `You're a
scoundrel,' he'd say, with that smooth smile of his,
`Yes, that's so.'  A minister should have more
backbone.  The long and the short of it is, I consider
him a reverend jackass.  But, of course, this is just
between you and me.  When there are Methodists in
hearing I praise him to the skies.  Some folks think
his wife dresses too gay, but _I_ say when she has to
live with a face like that she needs something to cheer
her up.  You'll never hear ME condemning a woman for
her dress.  I'm only too thankful when her husband
isn't too mean and miserly to allow it.  Not that I
bother much with dress myself.  Women just dress to
please the men, and I'd never stoop to THAT.  I have
had a real placid, comfortable life, dearie, and it's
just because I never cared a cent what the men
thought."
<P>
"Why do you hate the men so, Miss Bryant?"
<P>
"Lord, dearie, I don't hate them.  They aren't worth
it.  I just sort of despise them.  I think I'll like
YOUR husband if he keeps on as he has begun.  But apart
from him about the only men in the world I've much use
for are the old doctor and Captain Jim."
<P>
"Captain Jim is certainly splendid," agreed Anne
cordially.
<P>
"Captain Jim is a good man, but he's kind of vexing in
one way.  You CAN'T make him mad.  I've tried for
twenty years and he just keeps on being placid.  It
does sort of rile me.  And I s'pose the woman he
should have married got a man who went into tantrums
twice a day."
<P>
"Who was she?"
<P>
"Oh, I don't know, dearie.  I never remember of Captain
Jim making up to anybody.  He was edging on old as far
as my memory goes.  He's seventy-six, you know.  I
never heard any reason for his staying a bachelor, but
there must be one, believe ME.  He sailed all his life
till five years ago, and there's no corner of the earth
he hasn't poked his nose into.  He and Elizabeth
Russell were great cronies, all their lives, but they
never had any notion of sweet-hearting.  Elizabeth
never married, though she had plenty of chances.  She
was a great beauty when she was young.  The year the
Prince of Wales came to the Island she was visiting her
uncle in Charlottetown and he was a Government
official, and so she got invited to the great ball. 
She was the prettiest girl there, and the Prince danced
with her, and all the other women he didn't dance with
were furious about it, because their social standing
was higher than hers and they said he shouldn't have
passed them over.  Elizabeth was always very proud of
that dance.  Mean folks said that was why she never
married--she couldn't put up with an ordinary man after
dancing with a prince.  But that wasn't so.  She told
me the reason once--it was because she had such a
temper that she was afraid she couldn't live peaceably
with any man.  She HAD an awful temper--she used to
have to go upstairs and bite pieces out of her bureau
to keep it down by times.  But I told her that wasn't
any reason for not marrying if she wanted to.  There's
no reason why we should let the men have a monopoly of
temper, is there, Mrs. Blythe, dearie?"
<P>
"I've a bit of temper myself," sighed Anne.
<P>
"It's well you have, dearie.  You won't be half so
likely to be trodden on, believe ME!  My, how that
golden glow of yours is blooming!  Your garden looks
fine.  Poor Elizabeth always took such care of it."
<P>
"I love it," said Anne.  "I'm glad it's so full of
old-fashioned flowers.  Speaking of gardening, we want
to get a man to dig up that little lot beyond the fir
grove and set it out with strawberry plants for us. 
Gilbert is so busy he will never get time for it this
fall.  Do you know anyone we can get?"
<P>
"Well, Henry Hammond up at the Glen goes out doing jobs
like that.  He'll do, maybe.  He's always a heap more
interested in his wages than in his work, just like a
man, and he's so slow in the uptake that he stands
still for five minutes before it dawns on him that he's
stopped.  His father threw a stump at him when he was
small.
<P>
Nice gentle missile, wasn't it?  So like a man! 
Course, the boy never got over it.  But he's the only
one I can recommend at all.  He painted my house for me
last spring.  It looks real nice now, don't you
think?"
<P>
Anne was saved by the clock striking five.
<P>
"Lord, is it that late?" exclaimed Miss Cornelia. 
"How time does slip by when you're enjoying yourself! 
Well, I must betake myself home."
<P>
"No, indeed!  You are going to stay and have tea with
us," said Anne eagerly.
<P>
"Are you asking me because you think you ought to, or
because you really want to?" demanded Miss Cornelia.
<P>
"Because I really want to."
<P>
"Then I'll stay.  YOU belong to the race that knows
Joseph."
<P>
"I know we are going to be friends," said Anne, with
the smile that only they of the household of faith ever
saw.
<P>
"Yes, we are, dearie.  Thank goodness, we can choose
our friends.  We have to take our relatives as they
are, and be thankful if there are no penitentiary birds
among them.  Not that I've many-- none nearer than
second cousins.  I'm a kind of lonely soul, Mrs.
Blythe."
<P>
There was a wistful note in Miss Cornelia's voice.
<P>
"I wish you would call me Anne," exclaimed Anne
impulsively.  "It would seem more HOMEY.  Everyone in
Four Winds, except my husband, calls me Mrs. Blythe,
and it makes me feel like a stranger.  Do you know that
your name is very near being the one I yearned after
when I was a child.  I hated `Anne' and I called myself
`Cordelia' in imagination."
<P>
"I like Anne.  It was my mother's name.  Old-fashioned
names are the best and sweetest in my opinion.  If
you're going to get tea you might send the young doctor
to talk to me.  He's been lying on the sofa in that
office ever since I came, laughing fit to kill over
what I've been saying."
<P>
"How did you know?" cried Anne, too aghast at this
instance of Miss Cornelia's uncanny prescience to make
a polite denial.
<P>
"I saw him sitting beside you when I came up the lane,
and I know men's tricks," retorted Miss Cornelia. 
"There, I've finished my little dress, dearie, and the
eighth baby can come as soon as it pleases."
