<p>During the remainder of the evening, Miss Belinda was a prey to
wretchedness and despair. When she raised her eyes to her hostess, she
met with a glance full of icy significance; when she looked across the
tea-table, she saw Octavia seated next to Mr. Francis Barold,
monopolizing his attention, and apparently in the very best possible
spirits. It only made matters worse, that Mr. Francis Barold seemed to
find her remarks worthy of his attention. He drank very little tea, and
now and then appeared much interested and amused. In fact, he found Miss
Octavia even more entertaining than he had found her during their
journey. She did not hesitate at all to tell him that she was delighted
to see him again at this particular juncture.
</p><p>"You don't know how glad I was to see you come in," she said.
</p><p>She met his rather startled glance with the most open candor as she
spoke.
</p><p>"It is very civil of you to say so," he said; "but you can hardly expect
me to believe it, you know. It is too good to be true."
</p><p>"I thought it was too good to be true when the door opened," she answered
cheerfully. "I should have been glad to see <u>anybody</u>, almost"--
</p><p>"Well, that," he interposed, "isn't quite so civil."
</p><p>"It is not quite so civil to"--
</p><p>But there she checked herself, and asked him a question with the most
<u>naive</u> seriousness.
</p><p>"Are you a great friend of Lady Theobald's?" she said.
</p><p>"No," he answered. "I am a relative."
</p><p>"That's worse," she remarked.
</p><p>"It is," he replied. "Very much worse."
</p><p>"I asked you," she proceeded, with an entrancing little smile of
irreverent approval, "because I was going to say that my last speech was
not quite so civil to Lady Theobald."
</p><p>"That is perfectly true," he responded. "It wasn't civil to her at all."
</p><p>He was passing his time very comfortably, and was really surprised to
feel that he was more interested in these simple audacities than he had
been in any conversation for some time. Perhaps it was because his
companion was so wonderfully pretty, but it is not unlikely that there
were also other reasons. She looked him straight in the eyes, she
comported herself after the manner of a young lady who was enjoying
herself, and yet he felt vaguely that she might have enjoyed herself
quite as much with Burmistone, and that it was probable that she would
not think a second time of him, or of what she said to him.
</p><p>After tea, when they returned to the drawing-room, the opportunities
afforded for conversation were not numerous. The piano was opened, and
one after another of the young ladies were invited to exhibit their
prowess. Upon its musical education Slowbridge prided itself. "Few
towns," Miss Pilcher frequently remarked, "could be congratulated upon
the possession of <u>such</u> talent and <u>such</u> cultivation." The Misses
Egerton played a duet, the Misses Loftus sang, Miss Abercrombie
"executed" a sonata with such effect as to melt Miss Pilcher to tears;
and still Octavia had not been called upon. There might have been a
reason for this, or there might not; but the moment arrived, at length,
when Lady Theobald moved toward Miss Belinda with evidently fell intent.
</p><p>"Perhaps," she said, "perhaps your niece, Miss Octavia, will favor us."
</p><p>Miss Belinda replied in a deprecatory and uncertain murmur.
</p><p>"I--am not sure. I really don't know. Perhaps--Octavia, my dear."
</p><p>Octavia raised a smiling face.
</p><p>"I don't play," she said. "I never learned."
</p><p>"You do not play!" exclaimed Lady Theobald. "You do not play at all!"
</p><p>"No," answered Octavia. "Not a note. And I think I am rather glad of it;
because, if I tried, I should be sure to do it worse than other people. I
would rather," with unimpaired cheerfulness, "let some one else do it."
</p><p>There were a few seconds of dead silence. A dozen people seated around
her had heard. Miss Pilcher shuddered; Miss Belinda looked down; Mr.
Francis Barold preserved an entirely unmoved countenance, the general
impression being that he was very much shocked, and concealed his disgust
with an effort.
</p><p>"My dear," said Lady Theobald, with an air of much condescension and some
grave pity, "I should advise you to try to learn. I can assure you that
you would find it a great source of pleasure."
</p><p>"If you could assure me that my friends would find it a great source of
pleasure, I might begin," answered the mistaken young person, still
cheerfully; "but I am afraid they wouldn't."
</p><p>It seemed that fate had marked her for disgrace. In half an hour from
that time she capped the climax of her indiscretions.
</p><p>The evening being warm, the French windows had been left open; and, in
passing one of them, she stopped a moment to look out at the brightly
moonlit grounds.
</p><p>Barold, who was with her, paused too.
</p><p>"Looks rather nice, doesn't it?" he said.
</p><p>"Yes," she replied. "Suppose we go out on the terrace."
</p><p>He laughed in an amused fashion she did not understand.
</p><p>"Suppose we do," he said. "By Jove, that's a good idea!"
</p><p>He laughed as he followed her.
</p><p>"What amuses you so?" she inquired.
</p><p>"Oh!" he replied, "I am merely thinking of Lady Theobald."
</p><p>"Well," she commented, "I think it's rather disrespectful in you to
laugh. Isn't it a lovely night? I didn't think you had such moonlight
nights in England. What a night for a drive!"
</p><p>"Is that one of the things you do in America--drive by moonlight?"
</p><p>"Yes. Do you mean to say you don't do it in England?"
</p><p>"Not often. Is it young ladies who drive by moonlight in America?"
</p><p>"Well, you don't suppose they go alone, do you?" quite ironically. "Of
course they have some one with them."
</p><p>"Ah! Their papas?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Their mammas?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Their governesses, their uncles, their aunts?"
</p><p>"No," with a little smile.
</p><p>He smiled also.
</p><p>"That is another good idea," he said. "You have a great many nice ideas
in America."
</p><p>She was silent a moment or so, swinging her fan slowly to and fro by its
ribbon, and appearing to reflect.
</p><p>"Does that mean," she said at length, "that it wouldn't be considered
proper in England?"
</p><p>"I hope you won't hold me responsible for English fallacies," was his
sole answer.
</p><p>"I don't hold anybody responsible for them," she returned with some
spirit. "I don't care one thing about them."
</p><p>"That is fortunate," he commented. "I am happy to say I don't, either. I
take the liberty of pleasing myself. I find it pays best."
</p><p>"Perhaps," she said, returning to the charge, "perhaps Lady Theobald will
think <u>this</u> is improper."
</p><p>He put his hand up, and stroked his mustache lightly, without replying.
</p><p>"But it is <u>not</u>," she added emphatically: "it is _not!_"
</p><p>"No," he admitted, with a touch of irony, "it is not!"
</p><p>"Are <u>you</u> any the worse for it?" she demanded.
</p><p>"Well, really, I think not--as yet," he replied.
</p><p>"Then we won't go in," she said, the smile returning to her lips again.
