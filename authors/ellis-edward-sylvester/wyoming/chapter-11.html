<p>It caused Lieutenant Godfrey the deepest chagrin to reflect that,
after his remarkable escapes of the day, he had been taken prisoner
in this fashion.</p>

<p>He was in a crouching posture, watching the scene in front, when
several Seneca warriors returning to camp discovered him, and
before he could make an effective resistance, he was borne to
the ground, disarmed, and made prisoner.</p>

<p>But chagrin was quickly lost in alarm, for there could be no
doubt of the intentions of Queen Esther respecting all her captives.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the youth that his first misgiving was
concerning his father, who was but such a short distance behind
him, and he expected every minute to see the hapless man brought
in as his companion.</p>

<p>But as time passed, Fred gained hope for him, and, recalling
his pledge, believed he would keep beyond danger.</p>

<p>Katharine Montour bent her gaze upon the youth, as he came in
front of her escorted by several warriors, and then she broke
into a chuckling laugh.</p>

<p>This extraordinary creature was once quite popular with civilized
people, and she spoke English as well as the Seneca tongue.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha," she added, "you're another Yankee, ain't you?"</p>

<p>Fred had no wish to deny the charge, but he thought best to hold
his peace. If she were disposed to enter into a fair argument,
he could maintain his own with her; but the relative situation
of the two was that of the wolf and lamb in the fable, and, no
matter what line he might take, or how skillfully he might try
to conciliate her, she would only work herself into a still more
furious passion.</p>

<p>He therefore did wisely in not making any reply, but with his
hand at his side, and with a stolid, drooping, half-vacant gaze
like that of the other prisoners, he looked mutely at her.</p>

<p>The attractive appearance of the young lieutenant, and his manly
bearing when first brought before her, may have suggested to Queen
Esther that a prisoner of more consideration than usual was at
her disposal.</p>

<p>Her exultation, therefore, was the greater, because she would
gain this additional means of ministering to her thirst for vengeance.</p>

<p>"You Yankee officer?" she asked, peering into his handsome face.</p>

<p>"I am a lieutenant in the Continental army," answered Fred.</p>

<p>"<em>All</em> the captains were killed," was the truthful declaration
of the queen, "and more of you Yankees shall be killed; do you
see these here?" she asked, making a sweep with her hand toward
the captives. "All of them shall die by my hands&mdash;yes, by <em>my</em>
hands. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>Fred heard, but he did not think it wise to take the negative
of the question, and he continued to hold his peace.</p>

<p>While the Indians were looking on with that apparent indifference
which the race can so well assume under the most trying circumstances,
Queen Esther suddenly whipped out from the folds of her gaudy
dress a scalp, which she flourished in front of the prisoners.
Then, with many execrations, she began a weird song and dance
up and down in front of them.</p>

<p>This shocking scene lasted but a few minutes, when other Indians
came in with more prisoners, among whom Fred recognized several
acquaintances. They looked sorrowfully at each other, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>The lieutenant counted, and saw there were precisely eighteen,
besides himself. It must have been that Queen Esther had stopped
in this piece of woods, and, calling in a number of her Senecas,
had sent them out to bring in all the captives they could.</p>

<p>She had now secured enough to satisfy her, and she started up
the river with them.</p>

<p>The hapless ones walked in a straggling group together, while
the Indians were on either hand in front, and the Queen at the
rear, as if she wished to contemplate and enjoy the treat in prospect.</p>

<p>Whither they were going, Fred could only guess, but he was certain
that it was to some spot where torture would be inflicted on the
patriots.</p>

<p>The mixed company had progressed something like an eighth of
a mile, when a sudden confusion occurred in the ranks, and those
who looked around caught sight of a man dashing through the undergrowth
with the speed of a frightened deer.</p>

<p>Queen Esther recognized the figure as that of the young lieutenant,
and, with a shriek of rage, hurled her tomahawk, missing him only
by a hair's breadth.</p>

<p>At the same moment she called upon her warriors to recapture
him, and they dashed off with all speed, not needing the incentive
of her command.</p>

<p>It may be said that in such daring breaks for life as that of
Fred Godfrey, everything depends on the start. He made such a
tremendous bound that he was several rods distant before his foes
really understood what had taken place.</p>

<p>Another piece of extremely good fortune lay in the fact that
the woods where this was done were quite dense, and in the approaching
twilight the start gained by the fugitive actually placed him
beyond their sight.</p>

<p>This by no means insured his escape, for his pursuers were too
close on his heels, but it gave him an advantage, the importance
of which cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>Fred, as you have been told, was fleet of foot, and he now did
his utmost, but he could not hope to outrun those who were so
close.</p>

<p>He had gone a short distance only, when he turned to the right,
and threw himself down beside a fallen tree which lay across his
path, and he was not a moment too soon.</p>

<p>The next instant, two warriors bounded over the log and vanished
in the wood. As they were sure to suspect the trick that had been
played, Fred did not stay where he was. He knew the Senecas would
speedily return, and he could not elude such a search as they
would be sure to make.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "The next instant, two warriors bounded over the
log."]</p>

<p>Crawling away from the friendly log, he hurried silently off
in a crouching posture, and soon reached a point where he felt
quite safe from detection, though he did not throw his caution
aside.</p>

<p>As soon as he felt himself master of his movements he made his
way back to the point where he had separated from his father;
but, although he cautiously signaled to him, he received no response,
and he concluded that he was still in hiding somewhere in the
neighborhood, and was afraid to answer the calls, if, indeed,
he heard them; or he had managed to cross the Susquehanna, and
was searching for the rest of his family.</p>

<p>In either case it was a great relief to find he had not fallen
into the hands of Queen Esther, who was certain to be doubly savage,
now that she had lost the prisoner whom she valued the most.</p>

<p>"If those captives would only made a break," said Fred, to himself,
"some would get off; but, as it is, they are like dumb brutes
led to the slaughter, and all will perish miserably &mdash;Heaven
help them!"</p>
