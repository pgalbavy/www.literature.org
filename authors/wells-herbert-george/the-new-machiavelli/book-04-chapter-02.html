To any one who did not know of that glowing secret between Isabel 
and myself, I might well have appeared at that time the most 
successful and enviable of men.  I had recovered rapidly from an 
uncongenial start in political life; I had become a considerable 
force through the BLUE WEEKLY, and was shaping an increasingly 
influential body of opinion; I had re-entered Parliament with quite 
dramatic distinction, and in spite of a certain faltering on the 
part of the orthodox Conservatives towards the bolder elements in 
our propaganda, I had loyal and unenvious associates who were making 
me a power in the party.  People were coming to our group, 
understandings were developing.  It was clear we should play a 
prominent part in the next general election, and that, given a 
Conservative victory, I should be assured of office.  The world 
opened out to me brightly and invitingly.  Great schemes took shape 
in my mind, always more concrete, always more practicable; the years 
ahead seemed falling into order, shining with the credible promise 
of immense achievement.
<P>
And at the heart of it all, unseen and unsuspected, was the secret 
of my relations with Isabel--like a seed that germinates and 
thrusts, thrusts relentlessly.
<P>
From the onset of the Handitch contest onward, my meetings with her 
had been more and more pervaded by the discussion of our situation.  
It had innumerable aspects.  It was very present to us that we 
wanted to be together as much as possible--we were beginning to long 
very much for actual living together in the same house, so that one 
could come as it were carelessly--unawares--upon the other, busy 
perhaps about some trivial thing.  We wanted to feel each other in 
the daily atmosphere.  Preceding our imperatively sterile passion, 
you must remember, outside it, altogether greater than it so far as 
our individual lives were concerned, there had grown and still grew 
an enormous affection and intellectual sympathy between us.  We 
brought all our impressions and all our ideas to each other, to see 
them in each other's light.  It is hard to convey that quality of 
intellectual unison to any one who has not experienced it.  I 
thought more and more in terms of conversation with Isabel; her 
possible comments upon things would flash into my mind, oh!--with 
the very sound of her voice.
<P>
I remember, too, the odd effect of seeing her in the distance going 
about Handitch, like any stranger canvasser; the queer emotion of 
her approach along the street, the greeting as she passed.  The 
morning of the polling she vanished from the constituency.  I saw 
her for an instant in the passage behind our Committee rooms.
<P>
"Going?" said I.
<P>
She nodded.
<P>
"Stay it out.  I want you to see the fun.  I remember--the other 
time."
<P>
She didn't answer for a moment or so, and stood with face averted.
<P>
"It's Margaret's show," she said abruptly.  "If I see her smiling 
there like a queen by your side--!  She did--last time.  I 
remember."  She caught at a sob and dashed her hand across her face 
impatiently.  "Jealous fool, mean and petty, jealous fool! . . .  
Good luck, old man, to you!  You're going to win.  But I don't want 
to see the end of it all the same. . . ."
<P>
"Good-bye!" said I, clasping her hand as some supporter appeared in 
the passage. . . .
<P>
I came back to London victorious, and a little flushed and coarse 
with victory; and so soon as I could break away I went to Isabel's 
flat and found her white and worn, with the stain of secret weeping 
about her eyes.  I came into the room to her and shut the door.
<P>
"You said I'd win," I said, and held out my arms.
<P>
She hugged me closely for a moment.
<P>
"My dear," I whispered, "it's nothing--without you--nothing!"
<P>
We didn't speak for some seconds.  Then she slipped from my hold.  
"Look!" she said, smiling like winter sunshine.  "I've had in all 
the morning papers--the pile of them, and you--resounding."
<P>
"It's more than I dared hope."
<P>
"Or I."
<P>
She stood for a moment still smiling bravely, and then she was 
sobbing in my arms.  "The bigger you are--the more you show," she 
said--" the more we are parted.  I know, I know--"
<P>
I held her close to me, making no answer.
<P>
Presently she became still.  "Oh, well," she said, and wiped her 
eyes and sat down on the little sofa by the fire; and I sat down 
beside her.
<P>
"I didn't know all there was in love," she said, staring at the 
coals, "when we went love-making."
<P>
I put my arm behind her and took a handful of her dear soft hair in 
my hand and kissed it.
<P>
"You've done a great thing this time," she said.  "Handitch will 
make you."
<P>
"It opens big chances," I said.  "But why are you weeping, dear 
one?"
<P>
"Envy," she said, "and love."
<P>
"You're not lonely?"
<P>
"I've plenty to do--and lots of people."
<P>
"Well?"
<P>
"I want you."
<P>
"You've got me."
<P>
She put her arm about me and kissed me.  "I want you," she said, 
"just as if I had nothing of you.  You don't understand--how a woman 
wants a man.  I thought once if I just gave myself to you it would 
be enough.  It was nothing--it was just a step across the threshold.  
My dear, every moment you are away I ache for you--ache!  I want to 
be about when it isn't love-making or talk.  I want to be doing 
things for you, and watching you when you're not thinking of me.  
All those safe, careless, intimate things.  And something else--" 
She stopped.  "Dear, I don't want to bother you.  I just want you to 
know I love you. . . ."
<P>
She caught my head in her hands and kissed it, then stood up 
abruptly.
<P>
I looked up at her, a little perplexed.
<P>
"Dear heart," said I, "isn't this enough?  You're my councillor, my 
colleague, my right hand, the secret soul of my life--"
<P>
"And I want to darn your socks," she said, smiling back at me.
<P>
"You're insatiable."
<P>
She smiled "No," she said.  "I'm not insatiable, Master.  But I'm a 
woman in love.  And I'm finding out what I want, and what is 
necessary to me--and what I can't have.  That's all."
<P>
"We get a lot."
<P>
"We want a lot.  You and I are greedy people for the things we like, 
Master.  It's very evident we've got nearly all we can ever have of 
one another--and I'm not satisfied."
<P>
"What more is there?
<P>
"For you--very little.  I wonder.  For me--every thing.  Yes--
everything.  You didn't mean it, Master; you didn't know any more 
than I did when I began, but love between a man and a woman is 
sometimes very one-sided.  Fearfully one-sided!  That's all. . . ."
<P>
"Don't YOU ever want children?" she said abruptly.
<P>
"I suppose I do."
<P>
"You don't!"
<P>
"I haven't thought of them."
<P>
"A man doesn't, perhaps.  But I have. . . .  I want them--like 
hunger.  YOUR children, and home with you.  Really, continually you!  
That's the trouble. . . .  I can't have 'em, Master, and I can't 
have you."
<P>
She was crying, and through her tears she laughed.
<P>
"I'm going to make a scene," she said, "and get this over.  I'm so 
discontented and miserable; I've got to tell you.  It would come 
between us if I didn't.  I'm in love with you, with everything--with 
all my brains.  I'll pull through all right.  I'll be good, Master, 
never you fear.  But to-day I'm crying out with all my being.  This 
election--You're going up; you're going on.  In these papers--you're 
a great big fact.  It's suddenly come home to me.  At the back of my 
mind I've always had the idea I was going to have you somehow 
presently for myself--I mean to have you to go long tramps with, to 
keep house for, to get meals for, to watch for of an evening.  It's 
a sort of habitual background to my thought of you.  And it's 
nonsense--utter nonsense!"  She stopped.  She was crying and 
choking.  "And the child, you know--the child!"
<P>
I was troubled beyond measure, but Handitch and its intimations were 
clear and strong.
<P>
"We can't have that," I said.
<P>
"No," she said, "we can't have that."
<P>
"We've got our own things to do."
<P>
"YOUR things," she said.
<P>
"Aren't they yours too?"
<P>
"Because of you," she said.
<P>
"Aren't they your very own things?"
<P>
"Women don't have that sort of very own thing.  Indeed, it's true!  
And think!  You've been down there preaching the goodness of 
children, telling them the only good thing in a state is happy, 
hopeful children, working to free mothers and children--"
<P>
"And we give our own children to do it?" I said.
<P>
"Yes," she said.  "And sometimes I think it's too much to give--too 
much altogether. . . .  Children get into a woman's brain--when she 
mustn't have them, especially when she must never hope for them.  
Think of the child we might have now!--the little creature with 
soft, tender skin, and little hands and little feet!  At times it 
haunts me.  It comes and says, Why wasn't I given life?  I can hear 
it in the night. . . .  The world is full of such little ghosts, 
dear lover--little things that asked for life and were refused.  
They clamour to me.  It's like a little fist beating at my heart.  
Love children, beautiful children.  Little cold hands that tear at 
my heart!  Oh, my heart and my lord!"  She was holding my arm with 
both her hands and weeping against it, and now she drew herself to 
my shoulder and wept and sobbed in my embrace.  "I shall never sit 
with your child on my knee and you beside me-never, and I am a woman 
and your lover! . . ."
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
But the profound impossibility of our relation was now becoming more 
and more apparent to us.  We found ourselves seeking justification, 
clinging passionately to a situation that was coldly, pitilessly, 
impossible and fated.  We wanted quite intensely to live together 
and have a child, but also we wanted very many other things that 
were incompatible with these desires.  It was extraordinarily 
difficult to weigh our political and intellectual ambitions against 
those intimate wishes.  The weights kept altering according as one 
found oneself grasping this valued thing or that.  It wasn't as if 
we could throw everything aside for our love, and have that as we 
wanted it.  Love such as we bore one another isn't altogether, or 
even chiefly, a thing in itself--it is for the most part a value set 
upon things.  Our love was interwoven with all our other interests; 
to go out of the world and live in isolation seemed to us like 
killing the best parts of each other; we loved the sight of each 
other engaged finely and characteristically, we knew each other best 
as activities.  We had no delusions about material facts; we didn't 
want each other alive or dead, we wanted each other fully alive.  We 
wanted to do big things together, and for us to take each other 
openly and desperately would leave us nothing in the world to do.  
We wanted children indeed passionately, but children with every 
helpful chance in the world, and children born in scandal would be 
handicapped at every turn.  We wanted to share a home, and not a 
solitude.
<P>
And when we were at this stage of realisation, began the intimations 
that we were found out, and that scandal was afoot against us. . . .
<P>
I heard of it first from Esmeer, who deliberately mentioned it, with 
that steady grey eye of his watching me, as an instance of the 
preposterous falsehoods people will circulate.  It came to Isabel 
almost simultaneously through a married college friend, who made it 
her business to demand either confirmation or denial.  It filled us 
both with consternation.  In the surprise of the moment Isabel 
admitted her secret, and her friend went off "reserving her freedom 
of action."
<P>
Discovery broke out in every direction.  Friends with grave faces 
and an atmosphere of infinite tact invaded us both.  Other friends 
ceased to invade either of us.  It was manifest we had become--we 
knew not how--a private scandal, a subject for duologues, an 
amazement, a perplexity, a vivid interest.  In a few brief weeks it 
seemed London passed from absolute unsuspiciousness to a chattering 
exaggeration of its knowledge of our relations.
<P>
It was just the most inappropriate time for that disclosure.  The 
long smouldering antagonism to my endowment of motherhood ideas had 
flared up into an active campaign in the EXPURGATOR, and it would be 
altogether disastrous to us if I should be convicted of any personal 
irregularity.  It was just because of the manifest and challenging 
respectability of my position that I had been able to carry the 
thing as far as I had done.  Now suddenly my fortunes had sprung a 
leak, and scandal was pouring in. . . .  It chanced, too, that a 
wave of moral intolerance was sweeping through London, one of those 
waves in which the bitterness of the consciously just finds an ally 
in the panic of the undiscovered.  A certain Father Blodgett had 
been preaching against social corruption with extraordinary force, 
and had roused the Church of England people to a kind of competition 
in denunciation.  The old methods of the Anti-Socialist campaign had 
been renewed, and had offered far too wide a scope and too tempting 
an opportunity for private animosity, to be restricted to the 
private affairs of the Socialists.  I had intimations of an 
extensive circulation of "private and confidential" letters. . . .
<P>
I think there can be nothing else in life quite like the unnerving 
realisation that rumour and scandal are afoot about one.  Abruptly 
one's confidence in the solidity of the universe disappears.  One 
walks silenced through a world that one feels to be full of 
inaudible accusations.  One cannot challenge the assault, get it out 
into the open, separate truth and falsehood.  It slinks from you, 
turns aside its face.  Old acquaintances suddenly evaded me, made 
extraordinary excuses; men who had presumed on the verge of my world 
and pestered me with an intrusive enterprise, now took the bold step 
of flat repudiation.  I became doubtful about the return of a nod, 
retracted all those tentacles of easy civility that I had hitherto 
spread to the world.  I still grow warm with amazed indignation when 
I recall that Edward Crampton, meeting me full on the steps of the 
Climax Club, cut me dead.  "By God!" I cried, and came near catching 
him by the throat and wringing out of him what of all good deeds and 
bad, could hearten him, a younger man than I and empty beyond 
comparison, to dare to play the judge to me.  And then I had an open 
slight from Mrs. Millingham, whom I had counted on as one counts 
upon the sunrise.  I had not expected things of that sort; they were 
disconcerting beyond measure; it was as if the world were giving way 
beneath my feet, as though something failed in the essential 
confidence of life, as though a hand of wet ice had touched my 
heart.  Similar things were happening to Isabel.  Yet we went on 
working, visiting, meeting, trying to ignore this gathering of 
implacable forces against us.
<P>
For a time I was perplexed beyond measure to account for this 
campaign.  Then I got a clue.  The centre of diffusion was the 
Bailey household.  The Baileys had never forgiven me my abandonment 
of the young Liberal group they had done so much to inspire and 
organise; their dinner-table had long been a scene of hostile 
depreciation of the BLUE WEEKLY and all its allies; week after week 
Altiora proclaimed that I was "doing nothing," and found other 
causes for our bye-election triumphs; I counted Chambers Street a 
dangerous place for me.  Yet, nevertheless, I was astonished to find 
them using a private scandal against me.  They did.  I think 
Handitch had filled up the measure of their bitterness, for I had 
not only abandoned them, but I was succeeding beyond even their 
power of misrepresentation.  Always I had been a wasp in their 
spider's web, difficult to claim as a tool, uncritical, 
antagonistic.  I admired their work and devotion enormously, but I 
had never concealed my contempt for a certain childish vanity they 
displayed, and for the frequent puerility of their political 
intrigues.  I suppose contempt galls more than injuries, and anyhow 
they had me now.  They had me.  Bailey, I found, was warning fathers 
of girls against me as a "reckless libertine," and Altiora, flushed, 
roguish, and dishevelled, was sitting on her fender curb after 
dinner, and pledging little parties of five or six women at a time 
with infinite gusto not to let the matter go further.  Our cell was 
open to the world, and a bleak, distressful daylight streaming in.
<P>
I had a gleam of a more intimate motive in Altiora from the reports 
that came to me.  Isabel had been doing a series of five or six 
articles in the POLITICAL REVIEW in support of our campaign, the 
POLITICAL REVIEW which had hitherto been loyally Baileyite.  Quite 
her best writing up to the present, at any rate, is in those papers, 
and no doubt Altiora had had not only to read her in those invaded 
columns, but listen to her praises in the mouths of the tactless 
influential.  Altiora, like so many people who rely on gesture and 
vocal insistence in conversation, writes a poor and slovenly prose 
and handles an argument badly; Isabel has her University training 
behind her and wrote from the first with the stark power of a clear-
headed man.  "Now we know," said Altiora, with just a gleam of 
malice showing through her brightness, "now we know who helps with 
the writing!"
<P>
She revealed astonishing knowledge.
<P>
For a time I couldn't for the life of me discover her sources.  I 
had, indeed, a desperate intention of challenging her, and then I 
bethought me of a youngster named Curmain, who had been my 
supplemental typist and secretary for a time, and whom I had sent on 
to her before the days of our breach.  "Of course!" said I, 
"Curmain!"  He was a tall, drooping, sidelong youth with sandy hair, 
a little forward head, and a long thin neck.  He stole stamps, and, 
I suspected, rifled my private letter drawer, and I found him one 
day on a turn of the stairs looking guilty and ruffled with a pretty 
Irish housemaid of Margaret's manifestly in a state of hot 
indignation.  I saw nothing, but I felt everything in the air 
between them.  I hate this pestering of servants, but at the same 
time I didn't want Curmain wiped out of existence, so I had packed 
him off without unnecessary discussion to Altiora.  He was quick and 
cheap anyhow, and I thought her general austerity ought to redeem 
him if anything could; the Chambers Street housemaid wasn't for any 
man's kissing and showed it, and the stamps and private letters were 
looked after with an efficiency altogether surpassing mine.  And 
Altiora, I've no doubt left now whatever, pumped this young 
undesirable about me, and scenting a story, had him to dinner alone 
one evening to get to the bottom of the matter.  She got quite to 
the bottom of it,--it must have been a queer duologue.  She read 
Isabel's careless, intimate letters to me, so to speak, by this 
proxy, and she wasn't ashamed to use this information in the service 
of the bitterness that had sprung up in her since our political 
breach.  It was essentially a personal bitterness; it helped no 
public purpose of theirs to get rid of me.  My downfall in any 
public sense was sheer waste,--the loss of a man.  She knew she was 
behaving badly, and so, when it came to remonstrance, she behaved 
worse.  She'd got names and dates and places; the efficiency of her 
information was irresistible.  And she set to work at it 
marvellously.  Never before, in all her pursuit of efficient ideals, 
had Altiora achieved such levels of efficiency.  I wrote a protest 
that was perhaps ill-advised and angry, I went to her and tried to 
stop her.  She wouldn't listen, she wouldn't think, she denied and 
lied, she behaved like a naughty child of six years old which has 
made up its mind to be hurtful.  It wasn't only, I think, that she 
couldn't bear our political and social influence; she also--I 
realised at that interview couldn't bear our loving.  It seemed to 
her the sickliest thing,--a thing quite unendurable.  While such 
things were, the virtue had gone out of her world.
<P>
I've the vividest memory of that call of mine.  She'd just come in 
and taken off her hat, and she was grey and dishevelled and tired, 
and in a business-like dress of black and crimson that didn't suit 
her and was muddy about the skirts; she'd a cold in her head and 
sniffed penetratingly, she avoided my eye as she talked and 
interrupted everything I had to say; she kept stabbing fiercely at 
the cushions of her sofa with a long hat-pin and pretending she was 
overwhelmed with grief at the DEBACLE she was deliberately 
organising.
<P>
"Then part," she cried, "part.  If you don't want a smashing up,--
part!  You two have got to be parted.  You've got never to see each 
other ever, never to speak."  There was a zest in her voice.  "We're 
not circulating stories," she denied.  "No!  And Curmain never told 
us anything--Curmain is an EXCELLENT young man; oh! a quite 
excellent young man.  You misjudged him altogether." . . .
<P>
I was equally unsuccessful with Bailey.  I caught the little wretch 
in the League Club, and he wriggled and lied.  He wouldn't say where 
he had got his facts, he wouldn't admit he had told any one.  When I 
gave him the names of two men who had come to me astonished and 
incredulous, he attempted absurdly to make me think they had told 
HIM.  He did his horrible little best to suggest that honest old 
Quackett, who had just left England for the Cape, was the real 
scandalmonger.  That struck me as mean, even for Bailey.  I've still 
the odd vivid impression of his fluting voice, excusing the 
inexcusable, his big, shifty face evading me, his perspiration-
beaded forehead, the shrugging shoulders, and the would-be 
exculpatory gestures--Houndsditch gestures--of his enormous ugly 
hands.
<P>
"I can assure you, my dear fellow," he said; "I can assure you we've 
done everything to shield you--everything." . . .
<P>
<P>

<P>
Isabel came after dinner one evening and talked in the office.  She 
made a white-robed, dusky figure against the deep blues of my big 
window.  I sat at my desk and tore a quill pen to pieces as I 
talked.
<P>
"The Baileys don't intend to let this drop," I said.  "They mean 
that every one in London is to know about it."
<P>
"I know."
<P>
"Well!" I said.
<P>
"Dear heart," said Isabel, facing it, "it's no good waiting for 
things to overtake us; we're at the parting of the ways."
<P>
"What are we to do?"
<P>
"They won't let us go on."
<P>
"Damn them!"
<P>
"They are ORGANISING scandal."
<P>
"It's no good waiting for things to overtake us," I echoed; "they 
have overtaken us."  I turned on her.  "What do you want to do?"
<P>
"Everything," she said.  "Keep you and have our work.  Aren't we 
Mates?"
<P>
"We can't."
<P>
"And we can't!"
<P>
"I've got to tell Margaret," I said.
<P>
"Margaret!"
<P>
"I can't bear the idea of any one else getting in front with it.  
I've been wincing about Margaret secretly--"
<P>
"I know.  You'll have to tell her--and make your peace with her."
<P>
She leant back against the bookcases under the window.
<P>
"We've had some good times, Master;" she said, with a sigh in her 
voice.
<P>
And then for a long time we stared at one another in silence.
<P>
"We haven't much time left," she said.
<P>
"Shall we bolt?" I said.
<P>
"And leave all this?" she asked, with her eyes going round the room.  
"And that?"  And her head indicated Westminster.  "No!"
<P>
I said no more of bolting.
<P>
"We've got to screw ourselves up to surrender," she said.
<P>
"Something."
<P>
"A lot."
<P>
"Master," she said, "it isn't all sex and stuff between us?"
<P>
"No!"
<P>
"I can't give up the work.  Our work's my life."
<P>
We came upon another long pause.
<P>
"No one will believe we've ceased to be lovers--if we simply do," 
she said.
<P>
"We shouldn't."
<P>
"We've got to do something more parting than that."
<P>
I nodded, and again we paused.  She was coming to something.
<P>
"I could marry Shoesmith," she said abruptly.
<P>
"But--" I objected.
<P>
"He knows.  It wasn't fair.  I told him."
<P>
"Oh, that explains," I said.  "There's been a kind of sulkiness--
But--you told him?"
<P>
She nodded.  "He's rather badly hurt," she said.  "He's been a good 
friend to me.  He's curiously loyal.  But something, something he 
said one day--forced me to let him know. . . .  That's been the 
beastliness of all this secrecy.  That's the beastliness of all 
secrecy.  You have to spring surprises on people.  But he keeps on.  
He's steadfast.  He'd already suspected.  He wants me very badly to 
marry him. . . ."
<P>
"But you don't want to marry him?"
<P>
"I'm forced to think of it."
<P>
"But does he want to marry you at that?  Take you as a present from 
the world at large?--against your will and desire? . . .  I don't 
understand him."
<P>
"He cares for me."
<P>
"How?"
<P>
"He thinks this is a fearful mess for me.  He wants to pull it 
straight."
<P>
We sat for a time in silence, with imaginations that obstinately 
refused to take up the realities of this proposition.
<P>
"I don't want you to marry Shoesmith," I said at last.
<P>
"Don't you like him?"
<P>
"Not as your husband."
<P>
"He's a very clever and sturdy person--and very generous and devoted 
to me."
<P>
"And me?"
<P>
"You can't expect that.  He thinks you are wonderful--and, 
naturally, that you ought not to have started this."
<P>
"I've a curious dislike to any one thinking that but myself.  I'm 
quite ready to think it myself."
<P>
"He'd let us be friends--and meet."
<P>
"Let us be friends!" I cried, after a long pause.  "You and me!"
<P>
"He wants me to be engaged soon.  Then, he says, he can go round 
fighting these rumours, defending us both--and force a quarrel on 
the Baileys."
<P>
"I don't understand him," I said, and added, "I don't understand 
you."
<P>
I was staring at her face.  It seemed white and set in the dimness.
<P>
"Do you really mean this, Isabel?" I asked.
<P>
"What else is there to do, my dear?--what else is there to do at 
all?  I've been thinking day and night.  You can't go away with me.  
You can't smash yourself suddenly in the sight of all men.  I'd 
rather die than that should happen.  Look what you are becoming in 
the country!  Look at all you've built up!--me helping.  I wouldn't 
let you do it if you could.  I wouldn't let you--if it were only for 
Margaret's sake.  THIS . . . closes the scandal, closes everything."
<P>
"It closes all our life together," I cried.
<P>
She was silent.
<P>
"It never ought to have begun," I said.
<P>
She winced.  Then abruptly she was on her knees before me, with her 
hands upon my shoulder and her eyes meeting mine.
<P>
"My dear," she said very earnestly, "don't misunderstand me!  Don't 
think I'm retreating from the things we've done!  Our love is the 
best thing I could ever have had from life.  Nothing can ever equal 
it; nothing could ever equal the beauty and delight you and I have 
had together.  Never!  You have loved me; you do love me. . . .
<P>
No one could ever know how to love you as I have loved you; no one 
could ever love me as you have loved me, my king.  And it's just 
because it's been so splendid, dear; it's just because I'd die 
rather than have a tithe of all this wiped out of my life again--for 
it's made me, it's all I am--dear, it's years since I began loving 
you--it's just because of its goodness that I want not to end in 
wreckage now, not to end in the smashing up of all the big things I 
understand in you and love in you. . . .
<P>
"What is there for us if we keep on and go away?" she went on.  "All 
the big interests in our lives will vanish--everything.  We shall 
become specialised people--people overshadowed by a situation.  We 
shall be an elopement, a romance--all our breadth and meaning gone!  
People will always think of it first when they think of us; all our 
work and aims will be warped by it and subordinated to it.  Is it 
good enough, dear?  Just to specialise. . . .  I think of you.  
We've got a case, a passionate case, the best of cases, but do we 
want to spend all our lives defending it and justifying it?  And 
there's that other life.  I know now you care for Margaret--you care 
more than you think you do.  You have said fine things of her.  I've 
watched you about her.  Little things have dropped from you.  She's 
given her life for you; she's nothing without you.  You feel that to 
your marrow all the time you are thinking about these things.  Oh, 
I'm not jealous, dear.  I love you for loving her.  I love you in 
relation to her.  But there it is, an added weight against us, 
another thing worth saving."
<P>
Presently, I remember, she sat back on her heels and looked up into 
my face.  "We've done wrong--and parting's paying.  It's time to 
pay.  We needn't have paid, if we'd kept to the track. . . .  You 
and I, Master, we've got to be men."
<P>
"Yes," I said; "we've got to be men."
<P>
<P>
<P>
4
<P>
<P>
I was driven to tell Margaret about our situation by my intolerable 
dread that otherwise the thing might come to her through some stupid 
and clumsy informant.  She might even meet Altiora, and have it from 
her.
<P>
I can still recall the feeling of sitting at my desk that night in 
that large study of mine in Radnor Square, waiting for Margaret to 
come home.  It was oddly like the feeling of a dentist's reception-
room; only it was for me to do the dentistry with clumsy, cruel 
hands.  I had left the door open so that she would come in to me.
<P>
I heard her silken rustle on the stairs at last, and then she was in 
the doorway.  "May I come in?" she said.
<P>
"Do," I said, and turned round to her.
<P>
"Working?" she said.
<P>
"Hard," I answered.  "Where have YOU been?"
<P>
"At the Vallerys'.  Mr. Evesham was talking about you.  They were 
all talking.  I don't think everybody knew who I was.  Just Mrs. 
Mumble I'd been to them.  Lord Wardenham doesn't like you."
<P>
"He doesn't."
<P>
"But they all feel you're rather big, anyhow.  Then I went on to 
Park Lane to hear a new pianist and some other music at Eva's."
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Then I looked in at the Brabants' for some midnight tea before I 
came on here.  They'd got some writers--and Grant was there."
<P>
"You HAVE been flying round. . . ."
<P>
There was a little pause between us.
<P>
I looked at her pretty, unsuspecting face, and at the slender grace 
of her golden-robed body.  What gulfs there were between us!  
"You've been amused," I said.
<P>
"It's been amusing.  You've been at the House?"
<P>
"The Medical Education Bill kept me." . . .
<P>
After all, why should I tell her?  She'd got to a way of living that 
fulfilled her requirements.  Perhaps she'd never hear.  But all that 
day and the day before I'd been making up my mind to do the thing.
<P>
"I want to tell you something," I said.  "I wish you'd sit down for 
a moment or so." . . .
<P>
Once I had begun, it seemed to me I had to go through with it.
<P>
Something in the quality of my voice gave her an intimation of 
unusual gravity.  She looked at me steadily for a moment and sat 
down slowly in my armchair.
<P>
"What is it?" she said.
<P>
I went on awkwardly.  "I've got to tell you--something 
extraordinarily distressing," I said.
<P>
She was manifestly altogether unaware.
<P>
"There seems to be a good deal of scandal abroad--I've only recently 
heard of it--about myself--and Isabel."
<P>
"Isabel!"
<P>
I nodded.
<P>
"What do they say?" she asked.
<P>
It was difficult, I found, to speak.
<P>
"They say she's my mistress."
<P>
"Oh!  How abominable!"
<P>
She spoke with the most natural indignation.  Our eyes met.
<P>
"We've been great friends," I said.
<P>
"Yes.  And to make THAT of it.  My poor dear!  But how can they?"  
She paused and looked at me.  It's so incredible.  How can any one 
believe it?  I couldn't."
<P>
She stopped, with her distressed eyes regarding me.  Her expression 
changed to dread.  There was a tense stillness for a second, 
perhaps.
<P>
I turned my face towards the desk, and took up and dropped a handful 
of paper fasteners.
<P>
"Margaret," I said, " I'm afraid you'll have to believe it."
<P>
<P>
<P>
5
<P>
<P>
Margaret sat very still.  When I looked at her again, her face was 
very white, and her distressed eyes scrutinised me.  Her lips 
quivered as she spoke.  "You really mean--THAT?" she said.
<P>
I nodded.
<P>
"I never dreamt."
<P>
"I never meant you to dream."
<P>
"And that is why--we've been apart?"
<P>
I thought.  "I suppose it is."
<P>
"Why have you told me now?"
<P>
"Those rumours.  I didn't want any one else to tell you."
<P>
"Or else it wouldn't have mattered?"
<P>
"No."
<P>
She turned her eyes from me to the fire.  Then for a moment she 
looked about the room she had made for me, and then quite silently, 
with a childish quivering of her lips, with a sort of dismayed 
distress upon her face, she was weeping.  She sat weeping in her 
dress of cloth of gold, with her bare slender arms dropped limp over 
the arms of her chair, and her eyes averted from me, making no 
effort to stay or staunch her tears.  "I am sorry, Margaret," I 
said.  "I was in love. . . .  I did not understand. . . ."
<P>
Presently she asked: "What are you going to do?"
<P>
"You see, Margaret, now it's come to be your affair--I want to know 
what you--what you want."
<P>
"You want to leave me?"
<P>
"If you want me to, I must."
<P>
"Leave Parliament--leave all the things you are doing,--all this 
fine movement of yours?"
<P>
"No." I spoke sullenly.  "I don't want to leave anything.  I want to 
stay on.  I've told you, because I think we--Isabel and I, I mean--
have got to drive through a storm of scandal anyhow.  I don't know 
how far things may go, how much people may feel, and I can't, I 
can't have you unconscious, unarmed, open to any revelation--"
<P>
She made no answer.
<P>
"When the thing began--I knew it was stupid but I thought it was a 
thing that wouldn't change, wouldn't be anything but itself, 
wouldn't unfold--consequences. . . .  People have got hold of these 
vague rumours. . . .  Directly it reached any one else but--but us 
two--I saw it had to come to you."
<P>
I stopped.  I had that distressful feeling I have always had with 
Margaret, of not being altogether sure she heard, of being doubtful 
if she understood.  I perceived that once again I had struck at her 
and shattered a thousand unsubstantial pinnacles.  And I couldn't 
get at her, to help her, or touch her mind!  I stood up, and at my 
movement she moved.  She produced a dainty little handkerchief, and 
made an effort to wipe her face with it, and held it to her eyes.  
"Oh, my Husband!" she sobbed.
<P>
"What do you mean to do?" she said, with her voice muffled by her 
handkerchief.
<P>
"We're going to end it," I said.
<P>
Something gripped me tormentingly as I said that.  I drew a chair 
beside her and sat down.  "You and I, Margaret, have been partners," 
I began.  "We've built up this life of ours together; I couldn't 
have done it without you.  We've made a position, created a work--"
<P>
She shook her head.  "You," she said.
<P>
"You helping.  I don't want to shatter it--if you don't want it 
shattered.  I can't leave my work.  I can't leave you.  I want you 
to have--all that you have ever had.  I've never meant to rob you.  
I've made an immense and tragic blunder.  You don't know how things 
took us, how different they seemed!  My character and accident have 
conspired--We'll pay--in ourselves, not in our public service."
<P>
I halted again.  Margaret remained very still.
<P>
"I want you to understand that the thing is at an end.  It is 
definitely at an end.  We--we talked--yesterday.  We mean to end it 
altogether." I clenched my hands.  "She's--she's going to marry 
Arnold Shoesmith."
<P>
I wasn't looking now at Margaret any more, but I heard the rustle of 
her movement as she turned on me.
<P>
"It's all right," I said, clinging to my explanation.  "We're doing 
nothing shabby.  He knows.  He will.  It's all as right--as things 
can be now.  We're not cheating any one, Margaret.  We're doing 
things straight--now.  Of course, you know. . . .  We shall--we 
shall have to make sacrifices.  Give things up pretty completely.  
Very completely. . . .  We shall have not to see each other for a 
time, you know.  Perhaps not a long time.  Two or three years.  Or 
write--or just any of that sort of thing ever--"
<P>
Some subconscious barrier gave way in me.  I found myself crying 
uncontrollably--as I have never cried since I was a little child.  I 
was amazed and horrified at myself.  And wonderfully, Margaret was 
on her knees beside me, with her arms about me, mingling her weeping 
with mine.  "Oh, my Husband!" she cried, my poor Husband!  Does it 
hurt you so?  I would do anything!  Oh, the fool I am!  Dear, I love 
you.  I love you over and away and above all these jealous little 
things!"
<P>
She drew down my head to her as a mother might draw down the head of 
a son.  She caressed me, weeping bitterly with me.  "Oh! my dear," 
she sobbed, "my dear!  I've never seen you cry!  I've never seen you 
cry.  Ever!  I didn't know you could.  Oh! my dear!  Can't you have 
her, my dear, if you want her?  I can't bear it!  Let me help you, 
dear.  Oh! my Husband!  My Man!  I can't bear to have you cry!"  For 
a time she held me in silence.
<P>
"I've thought this might happen, I dreamt it might happen.  You two, 
I mean.  It was dreaming put it into my head.  When I've seen you 
together, so glad with each other. . . .  Oh!  Husband mine, believe 
me! believe me!  I'm stupid, I'm cold, I'm only beginning to realise 
how stupid and cold, but all I want in all the world is to give my 
life to you." . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
"We can't part in a room," said Isabel.
<P>
"We'll have one last talk together," I said, and planned that we 
should meet for a half a day between Dover and Walmer and talk 
ourselves out.  I still recall that day very well, recall even the 
curious exaltation of grief that made our mental atmosphere 
distinctive and memorable.  We had seen so much of one another, had 
become so intimate, that we talked of parting even as we parted with 
a sense of incredible remoteness.  We went together up over the 
cliffs, and to a place where they fall towards the sea, past the 
white, quaint-lanterned lighthouses of the South Foreland.  There, 
in a kind of niche below the crest, we sat talking.  It was a 
spacious day, serenely blue and warm, and on the wrinkled water 
remotely below a black tender and six hooded submarines came 
presently, and engaged in mysterious manoeuvers.  Shrieking gulls 
and chattering jackdaws circled over us and below us, and dived and 
swooped; and a skerry of weedy, fallen chalk appeared, and gradually 
disappeared again, as the tide fell and rose.
<P>
We talked and thought that afternoon on every aspect of our 
relations.  It seems to me now we talked so wide and far that 
scarcely an issue in the life between man and woman can arise that 
we did not at least touch upon.  Lying there at Isabel's feet, I 
have become for myself a symbol of all this world-wide problem 
between duty and conscious, passionate love the world has still to 
solve.  Because it isn't solved; there's a wrong in it either way. . 
. .  The sky, the wide horizon, seemed to lift us out of ourselves 
until we were something representative and general.  She was 
womanhood become articulate, talking to her lover.
<P>
"I ought," I said, "never to have loved you."
<P>
"It wasn't a thing planned," she said.
<P>
"I ought never to have let our talk slip to that, never to have 
turned back from America."
<P>
"I'm glad we did it," she said.  "Don't think I repent."
<P>
I looked at her.
<P>
"I will never repent," she said.  "Never!" as though she clung to 
her life in saying it.
<P>
I remember we talked for a long time of divorce.  It seemed to us 
then, and it seems to us still, that it ought to have been possible 
for Margaret to divorce me, and for me to marry without the 
scandalous and ugly publicity, the taint and ostracism that follow 
such a readjustment.  We went on to the whole perplexing riddle of 
marriage.  We criticised the current code, how muddled and 
conventionalised it had become, how modified by subterfuges and 
concealments and new necessities, and the increasing freedom of 
women.  "It's all like Bromstead when the building came," I said; 
for I had often talked to her of that early impression of purpose 
dissolving again into chaotic forces.  "There is no clear right in 
the world any more.  The world is Byzantine.  The justest man to-day 
must practise a tainted goodness."
<P>
These questions need discussion--a magnificent frankness of 
discussion--if any standards are again to establish an effective 
hold upon educated people.  Discretions, as I have said already, 
will never hold any one worth holding--longer than they held us.  
Against every "shalt not" there must be a "why not" plainly put,--
the "why not" largest and plainest, the law deduced from its 
purpose.  "You and I, Isabel," I said, "have always been a little 
disregardful of duty, partly at least because the idea of duty comes 
to us so ill-clad.  Oh! I know there's an extravagant insubordinate 
strain in us, but that wasn't all.  I wish humbugs would leave duty 
alone.  I wish all duty wasn't covered with slime.  That's where the 
real mischief comes in.  Passion can always contrive to clothe 
itself in beauty, strips itself splendid.  That carried us.  But for 
all its mean associations there is this duty. . . .
<P>
"Don't we come rather late to it?"
<P>
"Not so late that it won't be atrociously hard to do."
<P>
"It's queer to think of now," said Isabel.  "Who could believe we 
did all we have done honestly?  Well, in a manner honestly.  Who 
could believe we thought this might be hidden?  Who could trace it 
all step by step from the time when we found that a certain boldness 
in our talk was pleasing?  We talked of love. . . .  Master, there's 
not much for us to do in the way of Apologia that any one will 
credit.  And yet if it were possible to tell the very heart of our 
story. . . .
<P>
"Does Margaret really want to go on with you?" she asked--"shield 
you--knowing of . . . THIS?"
<P>
"I'm certain.  I don't understand--just as I don't understand 
Shoesmith, but she does.  These people walk on solid ground which is 
just thin air to us.  They've got something we haven't got.  
Assurances?  I wonder." . . .
<P>
Then it was, or later, we talked of Shoesmith, and what her life 
might be with him.
<P>
"He's good," she said; "he's kindly.  He's everything but magic.  
He's the very image of the decent, sober, honourable life.  You 
can't say a thing against him or I--except that something--something 
in his imagination, something in the tone of his voice--fails for 
me.  Why don't I love him?--he's a better man than you!  Why don't 
you?  IS he a better man than you?  He's usage, he's honour, he's 
the right thing, he's the breed and the tradition,--a gentleman.  
You're your erring, incalculable self.  I suppose we women will 
trust this sort and love your sort to the very end of time. . . ."
<P>
We lay side by side and nibbled at grass stalks as we talked.  It 
seemed enormously unreasonable to us that two people who had come to 
the pitch of easy and confident affection and happiness that held 
between us should be obliged to part and shun one another, or murder 
half the substance of their lives.  We felt ourselves crushed and 
beaten by an indiscriminating machine which destroys happiness in 
the service of jealousy.  "The mass of people don't feel these 
things in quite the same manner as we feel them," she said.  "Is it 
because they're different in grain, or educated out of some 
primitive instinct?"
<P>
"It's because we've explored love a little, and they know no more 
than the gateway," I said.  "Lust and then jealousy; their simple 
conception--and we have gone past all that and wandered hand in 
hand. . . ."
<P>
I remember that for a time we watched two of that larger sort of 
gull, whose wings are brownish-white, circle and hover against the 
blue.  And then we lay and looked at a band of water mirror clear 
far out to sea, and wondered why the breeze that rippled all the 
rest should leave it so serene.
<P>
"And in this State of ours," I resumed.
<P>
"Eh!" said Isabel, rolling over into a sitting posture and looking 
out at the horizon.  "Let's talk no more of things we can never see.  
Talk to me of the work you are doing and all we shall do--after we 
have parted.  We've said too little of that.  We've had our red 
life, and it's over.  Thank Heaven!--though we stole it!  Talk about 
your work, dear, and the things we'll go on doing--just as though we 
were still together.  We'll still be together in a sense--through 
all these things we have in common."
<P>
And so we talked of politics and our outlook.  We were interested to 
the pitch of self-forgetfulness.  We weighed persons and forces, 
discussed the probabilities of the next general election, the steady 
drift of public opinion in the north and west away from Liberalism 
towards us.  It was very manifest that in spite of Wardenham and the 
EXPURGATOR, we should come into the new Government strongly.  The 
party had no one else, all the young men were formally or informally 
with us; Esmeer would have office, Lord Tarvrille, I . . . and very 
probably there would be something for Shoesmith.  "And for my own 
part," I said, "I count on backing on the Liberal side.  For the 
last two years we've been forcing competition in constructive 
legislation between the parties.  The Liberals have not been long in 
following up our Endowment of Motherhood lead.  They'll have to give 
votes and lip service anyhow.  Half the readers of the BLUE WEEKLY, 
they say, are Liberals. . . .
<P>
"I remember talking about things of this sort with old Willersley," 
I said, "ever so many years ago.  It was some place near Locarno, 
and we looked down the lake that shone weltering--just as now we 
look over the sea.  And then we dreamt in an indistinct featureless 
way of all that you and I are doing now."
<P>
"I!" said Isabel, and laughed.
<P>
"Well, of some such thing," I said, and remained for awhile silent, 
thinking of Locarno.
<P>
I recalled once more the largeness, the release from small personal 
things that I had felt in my youth; statecraft became real and 
wonderful again with the memory, the gigantic handling of gigantic 
problems.  I began to talk out my thoughts, sitting up beside her, 
as I could never talk of them to any one but Isabel; began to 
recover again the purpose that lay under all my political ambitions 
and adjustments and anticipations.  I saw the State, splendid and 
wide as I had seen it in that first travel of mine, but now it was 
no mere distant prospect of spires and pinnacles, but populous with 
fine-trained, bold-thinking, bold-doing people.  It was as if I had 
forgotten for a long time and now remembered with amazement.
<P>
At first, I told her, I had been altogether at a loss how I could do 
anything to battle against the aimless muddle of our world; I had 
wanted a clue--until she had come into my life questioning, 
suggesting, unconsciously illuminating.  "But I have done nothing," 
she protested.  I declared she had done everything in growing to 
education under my eyes, in reflecting again upon all the processes 
that had made myself, so that instead of abstractions and blue-books 
and bills and devices, I had realised the world of mankind as a 
crowd needing before all things fine women and men.  We'd spoilt 
ourselves in learning that, but anyhow we had our lesson.  Before 
her I was in a nineteenth-century darkness, dealing with the nation 
as if it were a crowd of selfish men, forgetful of women and 
children and that shy wild thing in the hearts of men, love, which 
must be drawn upon as it has never been drawn upon before, if the 
State is to live.  I saw now how it is possible to bring the loose 
factors of a great realm together, to create a mind of literature 
and thought in it, and the expression of a purpose to make it self-
conscious and fine.  I had it all clear before me, so that at a 
score of points I could presently begin.  The BLUE WEEKLY was a 
centre of force.  Already we had given Imperialism a criticism, and 
leavened half the press from our columns.  Our movement consolidated 
and spread.  We should presently come into power.  Everything moved 
towards our hands.  We should be able to get at the schools, the 
services, the universities, the church; enormously increase the 
endowment of research, and organise what was sorely wanted, a 
criticism of research; contrive a closer contact between the press 
and creative intellectual life; foster literature, clarify, 
strengthen the public consciousness, develop social organisation and 
a sense of the State.  Men were coming to us every day, brilliant 
young peers like Lord Dentonhill, writers like Carnot and Cresswell.  
It filled me with pride to win such men.  "We stand for so much more 
than we seem to stand for," I said.  I opened my heart to her, so 
freely that I hesitate to open my heart even to the reader, telling 
of projects and ambitions I cherished, of my consciousness of great 
powers and widening opportunities. . . .
<P>
Isabel watched me as I talked.
<P>
She too, I think, had forgotten these things for a while.  For it is 
curious and I think a very significant thing that since we had 
become lovers, we had talked very little of the broader things that 
had once so strongly gripped our imaginations.
<P>
"It's good," I said, "to talk like this to you, to get back to youth 
and great ambitions with you.  There have been times lately when 
politics has seemed the pettiest game played with mean tools for 
mean ends--and none the less so that the happiness of three hundred 
million people might be touched by our follies.  I talk to no one 
else like this. . . .  And now I think of parting, I think but of 
how much more I might have talked to you." . . .
<P>
Things drew to an end at last, but after we had spoken of a thousand 
things.
<P>
"We've talked away our last half day," I said, staring over my 
shoulder at the blazing sunset sky behind us.  "Dear, it's been the 
last day of our lives for us. . . .  It doesn't seem like the last 
day of our lives.  Or any day."
<P>
"I wonder how it will feel?" said Isabel.
<P>
"It will be very strange at first--not to be able to tell you 
things."
<P>
"I've a superstition that after--after we've parted--if ever I go 
into my room and talk, you'll hear.  You'll be--somewhere."
<P>
"I shall be in the world--yes."
<P>
"I don't feel as though these days ahead were real.  Here we are, 
here we remain."
<P>
"Yes, I feel that.  As though you and I were two immortals, who 
didn't live in time and space at all, who never met, who couldn't 
part, and here we lie on Olympus.  And those two poor creatures who 
did meet, poor little Richard Remington and Isabel Rivers, who met 
and loved too much and had to part, they part and go their ways, and 
we lie here and watch them, you and I.  She'll cry, poor dear."
<P>
"She'll cry.  She's crying now!"
<P>
"Poor little beasts!  I think he'll cry too.  He winces.  He could--
for tuppence.  I didn't know he had lachrymal glands at all until a 
little while ago.  I suppose all love is hysterical--and a little 
foolish.  Poor mites!  Silly little pitiful creatures!  How we have 
blundered!  Think how we must look to God!  Well, we'll pity them, 
and then we'll inspire him to stiffen up again--and do as we've 
determined he shall do.  We'll see it through,--we who lie here on 
the cliff.  They'll be mean at times, and horrid at times; we know 
them!  Do you see her, a poor little fine lady in a great house,--
she sometimes goes to her room and writes."
<P>
"She writes for his BLUE WEEKLY still."
<P>
"Yes.  Sometimes--I hope.  And he's there in the office with a bit 
of her copy in his hand."
<P>
"Is it as good as if she still talked it over with him before she 
wrote it?  Is it?"
<P>
"Better, I think.  Let's play it's better--anyhow.  It may be that 
talking over was rather mixed with love-making.  After all, love-
making is joy rather than magic.  Don't let's pretend about that 
even. . . .  Let's go on watching him.  (I don't see why her writing 
shouldn't be better.  Indeed I don't.) See!  There he goes down 
along the Embankment to Westminster just like a real man, for all 
that he's smaller than a grain of dust.  What is running round 
inside that speck of a head of his?  Look at him going past the 
Policemen, specks too--selected large ones from the country.  I 
think he's going to dinner with the Speaker--some old thing like 
that.  Is his face harder or commoner or stronger?--I can't quite 
see. . . .  And now he's up and speaking in the House.  Hope he'll 
hold on to the thread.  He'll have to plan his speeches to the very 
end of his days--and learn the headings."
<P>
"Isn't she up in the women's gallery to hear him?"
<P>
"No.  Unless it's by accident."
<P>
"She's there," she said.
<P>
"Well, by accident it happens.  Not too many accidents, Isabel.  
Never any more adventures for us, dear, now.  No! . . .  They play 
the game, you know.  They've begun late, but now they've got to.  
You see it's not so very hard for them since you and I, my dear, are 
here always, always faithfully here on this warm cliff of love 
accomplished, watching and helping them under high heaven.  It isn't 
so VERY hard.  Rather good in some ways.  Some people HAVE to be 
broken a little.  Can you see Altiora down there, by any chance?"
<P>
"She's too little to be seen," she said.
<P>
"Can you see the sins they once committed?"
<P>
"I can only see you here beside me, dear--for ever.  For all my 
life, dear, till I die.  Was that--the sin?" . . .
<P>
I took her to the station, and after she had gone I was to drive to 
Dover, and cross to Calais by the night boat.  I couldn't, I felt, 
return to London.  We walked over the crest and down to the little 
station of Martin Mill side by side, talking at first in broken 
fragments, for the most part of unimportant things.
<P>
"None of this," she said abruptly, "seems in the slightest degree 
real to me.  I've got no sense of things ending."
<P>
"We're parting," I said.
<P>
"We're parting--as people part in a play.  It's distressing.  But I 
don't feel as though you and I were really never to see each other 
again for years.  Do you?"
<P>
I thought.  "No," I said.
<P>
"After we've parted I shall look to talk it over with you."
<P>
"So shall I."
<P>
"That's absurd."
<P>
"Absurd."
<P>
"I feel as if you'd always he there, just about where you are now.  
Invisible perhaps, but there.  We've spent so much of our lives 
joggling elbows." . . .
<P>
"Yes.  Yes.  I don't in the least realise it.  I suppose I shall 
begin to when the train goes out of the station.  Are we wanting in 
imagination, Isabel?"
<P>
"I don't know.  We've always assumed it was the other way about."
<P>
"Even when the train goes out of the station--!  I've seen you into 
so many trains."
<P>
"I shall go on thinking of things to say to you--things to put in 
your letters.  For years to come.  How can I ever stop thinking in 
that way now?  We've got into each other's brains."
<P>
"It isn't real," I said; "nothing is real.  The world's no more than 
a fantastic dream.  Why are we parting, Isabel?"
<P>
"I don't know.  It seems now supremely silly.  I suppose we have to.  
Can't we meet?--don't you think we shall meet even in dreams?"
<P>
"We'll meet a thousand times in dreams," I said.
<P>
"I wish we could dream at the same time," said Isabel. . . .  "Dream 
walks.  I can't believe, dear, I shall never have a walk with you 
again."
<P>
"If I'd stayed six months in America," I said, "we might have walked 
long walks and talked long talks for all our lives."
<P>
"Not in a world of Baileys," said Isabel.  "And anyhow--"
<P>
She stopped short.  I looked interrogation.
<P>
"We've loved," she said.
<P>
I took her ticket, saw to her luggage, and stood by the door of the 
compartment.  "Good-bye," I said a little stiffly, conscious of the 
people upon the platform.  She bent above me, white and dusky, 
looking at me very steadfastly.
<P>
"Come here," she whispered.  "Never mind the porters.  What can they 
know?  Just one time more--I must."
<P>
She rested her hand against the door of the carriage and bent down 
upon me, and put her cold, moist lips to mine.
