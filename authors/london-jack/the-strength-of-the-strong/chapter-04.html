It was Silas Bannerman who finally ran down that scientific wizard
and arch-enemy of mankind, Emil Gluck.  Gluck's confession, before
he went to the electric chair, threw much light upon the series of
mysterious events, many apparently unrelated, that so perturbed the
world between the years 1933 and 1941.  It was not until that
remarkable document was made public that the world dreamed of there
being any connection between the assassination of the King and
Queen of Portugal and the murders of the New York City police
officers.  While the deeds of Emil Gluck were all that was
abominable, we cannot but feel, to a certain extent, pity for the
unfortunate, malformed, and maltreated genius.  This side of his
story has never been told before, and from his confession and from
the great mass of evidence and the documents and records of the
time we are able to construct a fairly accurate portrait of him,
and to discern the factors and pressures that moulded him into the
human monster he became and that drove him onward and downward
along the fearful path he trod.
<P>
Emil Gluck was born in Syracuse, New York, in 1895.  His father,
Josephus Gluck, was a special policeman and night watchman, who, in
the year 1900, died suddenly of pneumonia.  The mother, a pretty,
fragile creature, who, before her marriage, had been a milliner,
grieved herself to death over the loss of her husband.  This
sensitiveness of the mother was the heritage that in the boy became
morbid and horrible.
<P>
In 1901, the boy, Emil, then six years of age, went to live with
his aunt, Mrs. Ann Bartell.  She was his mother's sister, but in
her breast was no kindly feeling for the sensitive, shrinking boy.
Ann Bartell was a vain, shallow, and heartless woman.  Also, she
was cursed with poverty and burdened with a husband who was a lazy,
erratic ne'er-do-well.  Young Emil Gluck was not wanted, and Ann
Bartell could be trusted to impress this fact sufficiently upon
him.  As an illustration of the treatment he received in that
early, formative period, the following instance is given.
<P>
When he had been living in the Bartell home a little more than a
year, he broke his leg.  He sustained the injury through playing on
the forbidden roof - as all boys have done and will continue to do
to the end of time.  The leg was broken in two places between the
knee and thigh.  Emil, helped by his frightened playmates, managed
to drag himself to the front sidewalk, where he fainted.  The
children of the neighbourhood were afraid of the hard-featured
shrew who presided over the Bartell house; but, summoning their
resolution, they rang the bell and told Ann Bartell of the
accident.  She did not even look at the little lad who lay stricken
on the sidewalk, but slammed the door and went back to her wash-
tub.  The time passed.  A drizzle came on, and Emil Gluck, out of
his faint, lay sobbing in the rain.  The leg should have been set
immediately.  As it was, the inflammation rose rapidly and made a
nasty case of it.  At the end of two hours, the indignant women of
the neighbourhood protested to Ann Bartell.  This time she came out
and looked at the lad.  Also she kicked him in the side as he lay
helpless at her feet, and she hysterically disowned him.  He was
not her child, she said, and recommended that the ambulance be
called to take him to the city receiving hospital.  Then she went
back into the house.
<P>
It was a woman, Elizabeth Shepstone, who came along, learned the
situation, and had the boy placed on a shutter.  It was she who
called the doctor, and who, brushing aside Ann Bartell, had the boy
carried into the house.  When the doctor arrived, Ann Bartell
promptly warned him that she would not pay him for his services.
For two months the little Emil lay in bed, the first month on his
back without once being turned over; and he lay neglected and
alone, save for the occasional visits of the unremunerated and
over-worked physician.  He had no toys, nothing with which to
beguile the long and tedious hours.  No kind word was spoken to
him, no soothing hand laid upon his brow, no single touch or act of
loving tenderness - naught but the reproaches and harshness of Ann
Bartell, and the continually reiterated information that he was not
wanted.  And it can well be understood, in such environment, how
there was generated in the lonely, neglected boy much of the
bitterness and hostility for his kind that later was to express
itself in deeds so frightful as to terrify the world.
<P>
It would seem strange that, from the hands of Ann Bartell, Emil
Gluck should have received a college education; but the explanation
is simple.  Her ne'er-do-well husband, deserting her, made a strike
in the Nevada goldfields, and returned to her a many-times
millionaire.  Ann Bartell hated the boy, and immediately she sent
him to the Farristown Academy, a hundred miles away.  Shy and
sensitive, a lonely and misunderstood little soul, he was more
lonely than ever at Farristown.  He never came home, at vacation,
and holidays, as the other boys did.  Instead, he wandered about
the deserted buildings and grounds, befriended and misunderstood by
the servants and gardeners, reading much, it is remembered,
spending his days in the fields or before the fire-place with his
nose poked always in the pages of some book.  It was at this time
that he over-used his eyes and was compelled to take up the wearing
of glasses, which same were so prominent in the photographs of him
published in the newspapers in 1941.
<P>
He was a remarkable student.  Application such as his would have
taken him far; but he did not need application.  A glance at a text
meant mastery for him.  The result was that he did an immense
amount of collateral reading and acquired more in half a year than
did the average student in half-a-dozen years.  In 1909, barely
fourteen years of age, he was ready - "more than ready" the
headmaster of the academy said - to enter Yale or Harvard.  His
juvenility prevented him from entering those universities, and so,
in 1909, we find him a freshman at historic Bowdoin College.  In
1913 he graduated with highest honours, and immediately afterward
followed Professor Bradlough to Berkeley, California.  The one
friend that Emil Gluck discovered in all his life was Professor
Bradlough.  The latter's weak lungs had led him to exchange Maine
for California, the removal being facilitated by the offer of a
professorship in the State University.  Throughout the year 1914,
Emil Gluck resided in Berkeley and took special scientific courses.
Toward the end of that year two deaths changed his prospects and
his relations with life.  The death of Professor Bradlough took
from him the one friend he was ever to know, and the death of Ann
Bartell left him penniless.  Hating the unfortunate lad to the
last, she cut him off with one hundred dollars.
<P>
The following year, at twenty years of age, Emil Gluck was enrolled
as an instructor of chemistry in the University of California.
Here the years passed quietly; he faithfully performed the drudgery
that brought him his salary, and, a student always, he took half-a-
dozen degrees.  He was, among other things, a Doctor of Sociology,
of Philosophy, and of Science, though he was known to the world, in
later days, only as Professor Gluck.
<P>
He was twenty-seven years old when he first sprang into prominence
in the newspapers through the publication of his book, SEX AND
PROGRESS.  The book remains to-day a milestone in the history and
philosophy of marriage.  It is a heavy tome of over seven hundred
pages, painfully careful and accurate, and startlingly original.
It was a book for scientists, and not one calculated to make a
stir.  But Gluck, in the last chapter, using barely three lines for
it, mentioned the hypothetical desirability of trial marriages.  At
once the newspapers seized these three lines, "played them up
yellow," as the slang was in those days, and set the whole world
laughing at Emil Gluck, the bespectacled young professor of twenty-
seven.  Photographers snapped him, he was besieged by reporters,
women's clubs throughout the land passed resolutions condemning him
and his immoral theories; and on the floor of the California
Assembly, while discussing the state appropriation to the
University, a motion demanding the expulsion of Gluck was made
under threat of withholding the appropriation - of course, none of
his persecutors had read the book; the twisted newspaper version of
only three lines of it was enough for them.  Here began Emil
Gluck's hatred for newspaper men.  By them his serious and
intrinsically valuable work of six years had been made a laughing-
stock and a notoriety.  To his dying day, and to their everlasting
regret, he never forgave them.
<P>
It was the newspapers that were responsible for the next disaster
that befell him.  For the five years following the publication of
his book he had remained silent, and silence for a lonely man is
not good.  One can conjecture sympathetically the awful solitude of
Emil Gluck in that populous University; for he was without friends
and without sympathy.  His only recourse was books, and he went on
reading and studying enormously.  But in 1927 he accepted an
invitation to appear before the Human Interest Society of
Emeryville.  He did not trust himself to speak, and as we write we
have before us a copy of his learned paper.  It is sober,
scholarly, and scientific, and, it must also be added,
conservative.  But in one place he dealt with, and I quote his
words, "the industrial and social revolution that is taking place
in society."  A reporter present seized upon the word "revolution,"
divorced it from the text, and wrote a garbled account that made
Emil Gluck appear an anarchist.  At once, "Professor Gluck,
anarchist," flamed over the wires and was appropriately "featured"
in all the newspapers in the land.
<P>
He had attempted to reply to the previous newspaper attack, but now
he remained silent.  Bitterness had already corroded his soul.  The
University faculty appealed to him to defend himself, but he
sullenly declined, even refusing to enter in defence a copy of his
paper to save himself from expulsion.  He refused to resign, and
was discharged from the University faculty.  It must be added that
political pressure had been put upon the University Regents and the
President.
<P>
Persecuted, maligned, and misunderstood, the forlorn and lonely man
made no attempt at retaliation.  All his life he had been sinned
against, and all his life he had sinned against no one.  But his
cup of bitterness was not yet full to overflowing.  Having lost his
position, and being without any income, he had to find work.  His
first place was at the Union Iron Works, in San Francisco, where he
proved a most able draughtsman.  It was here that he obtained his
firsthand knowledge of battleships and their construction.  But the
reporters discovered him and featured him in his new vocation.  He
immediately resigned and found another place; but after the
reporters had driven him away from half-a-dozen positions, he
steeled himself to brazen out the newspaper persecution.  This
occurred when he started his electroplating establishment - in
Oakland, on Telegraph Avenue.  It was a small shop, employing three
men and two boys.  Gluck himself worked long hours.  Night after
night, as Policeman Carew testified on the stand, he did not leave
the shop till one and two in the morning.  It was during this
period that he perfected the improved ignition device for gas-
engines, the royalties from which ultimately made him wealthy.
<P>
He started his electroplating establishment early in the spring of
1928, and it was in the same year that he formed the disastrous
love attachment for Irene Tackley.  Now it is not to be imagined
that an extraordinary creature such as Emil Gluck could be any
other than an extraordinary lover.  In addition to his genius, his
loneliness, and his morbidness, it must be taken into consideration
that he knew nothing about women.  Whatever tides of desire flooded
his being, he was unschooled in the conventional expression of
them; while his excessive timidity was bound to make his love-
making unusual.  Irene Tackley was a rather pretty young woman, but
shallow and light-headed.  At the time she worked in a small candy
store across the street from Gluck's shop.  He used to come in and
drink ice-cream sodas and lemon-squashes, and stare at her.  It
seems the girl did not care for him, and merely played with him.
He was "queer," she said; and at another time she called him a
crank when describing how he sat at the counter and peered at her
through his spectacles, blushing and stammering when she took
notice of him, and often leaving the shop in precipitate confusion.
<P>
Gluck made her the most amazing presents - a silver tea-service, a
diamond ring, a set of furs, opera-glasses, a ponderous HISTORY OF
THE WORLD in many volumes, and a motor-cycle all silver-plated in
his own shop.  Enters now the girl's lover, putting his foot down,
showing great anger, compelling her to return Gluck's strange
assortment of presents.  This man, William Sherbourne, was a gross
and stolid creature, a heavy-jawed man of the working class who had
become a successful building-contractor in a small way.  Gluck did
not understand.  He tried to get an explanation, attempting to
speak with the girl when she went home from work in the evening.
She complained to Sherbourne, and one night he gave Gluck a
beating.  It was a very severe beating, for it is on the records of
the Red Cross Emergency Hospital that Gluck was treated there that
night and was unable to leave the hospital for a week.
<P>
Still Gluck did not understand.  He continued to seek an
explanation from the girl.  In fear of Sherbourne, he applied to
the Chief of Police for permission to carry a revolver, which
permission was refused, the newspapers as usual playing it up
sensationally.  Then came the murder of Irene Tackley, six days
before her contemplated marriage with Sherbourne.  It was on a
Saturday night.  She had worked late in the candy store, departing
after eleven o'clock with her week's wages in her purse.  She rode
on a San Pablo Avenue surface car to Thirty-fourth Street, where
she alighted and started to walk the three blocks to her home.
That was the last seen of her alive.  Next morning she was found,
strangled, in a vacant lot.
<P>
Emil Gluck was immediately arrested.  Nothing that he could do
could save him.  He was convicted, not merely on circumstantial
evidence, but on evidence "cooked up" by the Oakland police.  There
is no discussion but that a large portion of the evidence was
manufactured.  The testimony of Captain Shehan was the sheerest
perjury, it being proved long afterward that on the night in
question he had not only not been in the vicinity of the murder,
but that he had been out of the city in a resort on the San Leandro
Road.  The unfortunate Gluck received life imprisonment in San
Quentin, while the newspapers and the public held that it was a
miscarriage of justice - that the death penalty should have been
visited upon him.
<P>
Gluck entered San Quentin prison on April 17, 1929.  He was then
thirty-four years of age.  And for three years and a half, much of
the time in solitary confinement, he was left to meditate upon the
injustice of man.  It was during that period that his bitterness
corroded home and he became a hater of all his kind.  Three other
things he did during the same period:  he wrote his famous
treatise, HUMAN MORALS, his remarkable brochure, THE CRIMINAL SANE,
and he worked out his awful and monstrous scheme of revenge.  It
was an episode that had occurred in his electroplating
establishment that suggested to him his unique weapon of revenge.
As stated in his confession, he worked every detail out
theoretically during his imprisonment, and was able, on his
release, immediately to embark on his career of vengeance.
<P>
His release was sensational.  Also it was miserably and criminally
delayed by the soulless legal red tape then in vogue.  On the night
of February 1, 1932, Tim Haswell, a hold-up man, was shot during an
attempted robbery by a citizen of Piedmont Heights.  Tim Haswell
lingered three days, during which time he not only confessed to the
murder of Irene Tackley, but furnished conclusive proofs of the
same.  Bert Danniker, a convict dying of consumption in Folsom
Prison, was implicated as accessory, and his confession followed.
It is inconceivable to us of to-day - the bungling, dilatory
processes of justice a generation ago.  Emil Gluck was proved in
February to be an innocent man, yet he was not released until the
following October.  For eight months, a greatly wronged man, he was
compelled to undergo his unmerited punishment.  This was not
conducive to sweetness and light, and we can well imagine how he
ate his soul with bitterness during those dreary eight months.
<P>
He came back to the world in the fall of 1932, as usual a "feature"
topic in all the newspapers.  The papers, instead of expressing
heartfelt regret, continued their old sensational persecution.  One
paper did more - the SAN FRANCISCO INTELLIGENCER.  John Hartwell,
its editor, elaborated an ingenious theory that got around the
confessions of the two criminals and went to show that Gluck was
responsible, after all, for the murder of Irene Tackley.  Hartwell
died.  And Sherbourne died too, while Policeman Phillipps was shot
in the leg and discharged from the Oakland police force.
<P>
The murder of Hartwell was long a mystery.  He was alone in his
editorial office at the time.  The reports of the revolver were
heard by the office boy, who rushed in to find Hartwell expiring in
his chair.  What puzzled the police was the fact, not merely that
he had been shot with his own revolver, but that the revolver had
been exploded in the drawer of his desk.  The bullets had torn
through the front of the drawer and entered his body.  The police
scouted the theory of suicide, murder was dismissed as absurd, and
the blame was thrown upon the Eureka Smokeless Cartridge Company.
Spontaneous explosion was the police explanation, and the chemists
of the cartridge company were well bullied at the inquest.  But
what the police did not know was that across the street, in the
Mercer Building, Room 633, rented by Emil Gluck, had been occupied
by Emil Gluck at the very moment Hartwell's revolver so
mysteriously exploded.
<P>
At the time, no connection was made between Hartwell's death and
the death of William Sherbourne.  Sherbourne had continued to live
in the home he had built for Irene Tackley, and one morning in
January, 1933, he was found dead.  Suicide was the verdict of the
coroner's inquest, for he had been shot by his own revolver.  The
curious thing that happened that night was the shooting of
Policeman Phillipps on the sidewalk in front of Sherbourne's house.
The policeman crawled to a police telephone on the corner and rang
up for an ambulance.  He claimed that some one had shot him from
behind in the leg.  The leg in question was so badly shattered by
three '38 calibre bullets that amputation was necessary.  But when
the police discovered that the damage had been done by his own
revolver, a great laugh went up, and he was charged with having
been drunk.  In spite of his denial of having touched a drop, and
of his persistent assertion that the revolver had been in his hip
pocket and that he had not laid a finger to it, he was discharged
from the force.  Emil Gluck's confession, six years later, cleared
the unfortunate policeman of disgrace, and he is alive to-day and
in good health, the recipient of a handsome pension from the city.
<P>
Emil Gluck, having disposed of his immediate enemies, now sought a
wider field, though his enmity for newspaper men and for the police
remained always active.  The royalties on his ignition device for
gasolene-engines had mounted up while he lay in prison, and year by
year the earning power of his invention increased.  He was
independent, able to travel wherever he willed over the earth and
to glut his monstrous appetite for revenge.  He had become a
monomaniac and an anarchist - not a philosophic anarchist, merely,
but a violent anarchist.  Perhaps the word is misused, and he is
better described as a nihilist, or an annihilist.  It is known that
he affiliated with none of the groups of terrorists.  He operated
wholly alone, but he created a thousandfold more terror and
achieved a thousandfold more destruction than all the terrorist
groups added together.
<P>
He signalized his departure from California by blowing up Fort
Mason.  In his confession he spoke of it as a little experiment -
he was merely trying his hand.  For eight years he wandered over
the earth, a mysterious terror, destroying property to the tune of
hundreds of millions of dollars, and destroying countless lives.
One good result of his awful deeds was the destruction he wrought
among the terrorists themselves.  Every time he did anything the
terrorists in the vicinity were gathered in by the police dragnet,
and many of them were executed.  Seventeen were executed at Rome
alone, following the assassination of the Italian King.
<P>
Perhaps the most world-amazing achievement of his was the
assassination of the King and Queen of Portugal.  It was their
wedding day.  All possible precautions had been taken against the
terrorists, and the way from the cathedral, through Lisbon's
streets, was double-banked with troops, while a squad of two
hundred mounted troopers surrounded the carriage.  Suddenly the
amazing thing happened.  The automatic rifles of the troopers began
to go off, as well as the rifles, in the immediate vicinity, of the
double-banked infantry.  In the excitement the muzzles of the
exploding rifles were turned in all directions.  The slaughter was
terrible - horses, troops, spectators, and the King and Queen, were
riddled with bullets.  To complicate the affair, in different parts
of the crowd behind the foot-soldiers, two terrorists had bombs
explode on their persons.  These bombs they had intended to throw
if they got the opportunity.  But who was to know this?  The
frightful havoc wrought by the bursting bombs but added to the
confusion; it was considered part of the general attack.
<P>
One puzzling thing that could not be explained away was the conduct
of the troopers with their exploding rifles.  It seemed impossible
that they should be in the plot, yet there were the hundreds their
flying bullets had slain, including the King and Queen.  On the
other hand, more baffling than ever was the fact that seventy per
cent. of the troopers themselves had been killed or wounded.  Some
explained this on the ground that the loyal foot-soldiers,
witnessing the attack on the royal carriage, had opened fire on the
traitors.  Yet not one bit of evidence to verify this could be
drawn from the survivors, though many were put to the torture.
They contended stubbornly that they had not discharged their rifles
at all, but that their rifles had discharged themselves.  They were
laughed at by the chemists, who held that, while it was just barely
probable that a single cartridge, charged with the new smokeless
powder, might spontaneously explode, it was beyond all probability
and possibility for all the cartridges in a given area, so charged,
spontaneously to explode.  And so, in the end, no explanation of
the amazing occurrence was reached.  The general opinion of the
rest of the world was that the whole affair was a blind panic of
the feverish Latins, precipitated, it was true, by the bursting of
two terrorist bombs; and in this connection was recalled the
laughable encounter of long years before between the Russian fleet
and the English fishing boats.
<P>
And Emil Gluck chuckled and went his way.  He knew.  But how was
the world to know?  He had stumbled upon the secret in his old
electroplating shop on Telegraph Avenue in the city of Oakland.  It
happened, at that time, that a wireless telegraph station was
established by the Thurston Power Company close to his shop.  In a
short time his electroplating vat was put out of order.  The vat-
wiring had many bad joints, and, on investigation, Gluck discovered
minute welds at the joints in the wiring.  These, by lowering the
resistance, had caused an excessive current to pass through the
solution, "boiling" it and spoiling the work.  But what had caused
the welds? was the question in Gluck's mind.  His reasoning was
simple.  Before the establishment of the wireless station, the vat
had worked well.  Not until after the establishment of the wireless
station had the vat been ruined.  Therefore the wireless station
had been the cause.  But how?  He quickly answered the question.
If an electric discharge was capable of operating a coherer across
three thousand miles of ocean, then, certainly, the electric
discharges from the wireless station four hundred feet away could
produce coherer effects on the bad joints in the vat-wiring.
<P>
Gluck thought no more about it at the time.  He merely re-wired his
vat and went on electroplating.  But afterwards, in prison, he
remembered the incident, and like a flash there came into his mind
the full significance of it.  He saw in it the silent, secret
weapon with which to revenge himself on the world.  His great
discovery, which died with him, was control over the direction and
scope of the electric discharge.  At the time, this was the
unsolved problem of wireless telegraphy - as it still is to-day -
but Emil Gluck, in his prison cell, mastered it.  And, when he was
released, he applied it.  It was fairly simple, given the directing
power that was his, to introduce a spark into the powder-magazines
of a fort, a battleship, or a revolver.  And not alone could he
thus explode powder at a distance, but he could ignite
conflagrations.  The great Boston fire was started by him - quite
by accident, however, as he stated in his confession, adding that
it was a pleasing accident and that he had never had any reason to
regret it.
<P>
It was Emil Gluck that caused the terrible German-American War,
with the loss of 800,000 lives and the consumption of almost
incalculable treasure.  It will be remembered that in 1939, because
of the Pickard incident, strained relations existed between the two
countries.  Germany, though aggrieved, was not anxious for war,
and, as a peace token, sent the Crown Prince and seven battleships
on a friendly visit to the United States.  On the night of February
15, the seven warships lay at anchor in the Hudson opposite New
York City.  And on that night Emil Gluck, alone, with all his
apparatus on board, was out in a launch.  This launch, it was
afterwards proved, was bought by him from the Ross Turner Company,
while much of the apparatus he used that night had been purchased
from the Columbia Electric Works.  But this was not known at the
time.  All that w\as known was that the seven battleships blew up,
one after another, at regular four-minute intervals.  Ninety per
cent. of the crews and officers, along with the Crown Prince,
perished.  Many years before, the American battleship Maine had
been blown up in the harbour of Havana, and war with Spain had
immediately followed - though there has always existed a reasonable
doubt as to whether the explosion was due to conspiracy or
accident.  But accident could not explain the blowing up of the
seven battleships on the Hudson at four-minute intervals.  Germany
believed that it had been done by a submarine, and immediately
declared war.  It was six months after Gluck's confession that she
returned the Philippines and Hawaii to the United States.
<P>
In the meanwhile Emil Gluck, the malevolent wizard and arch-hater,
travelled his whirlwind path of destruction.  He left no traces.
Scientifically thorough, he always cleaned up after himself.  His
method was to rent a room or a house, and secretly to install his
apparatus - which apparatus, by the way, he so perfected and
simplified that it occupied little space.  After he had
accomplished his purpose he carefully removed the apparatus.  He
bade fair to live out a long life of horrible crime.
<P>
The epidemic of shooting of New York City policemen was a
remarkable affair.  It became one of the horror mysteries of the
time.  In two short weeks over a hundred policemen were shot in the
legs by their own revolvers.  Inspector Jones did not solve the
mystery, but it was his idea that finally outwitted Gluck.  On his
recommendation the policemen ceased carrying revolvers, and no more
accidental shootings occurred.
<P>
It was in the early spring of 1940 that Gluck destroyed the Mare
Island navy-yard.  From a room in Vallejo he sent his electric
discharges across the Vallejo Straits to Mare Island.  He first
played his flashes on the battleship Maryland.  She lay at the dock
of one of the mine-magazines.  On her forward deck, on a huge
temporary platform of timbers, were disposed over a hundred mines.
These mines were for the defence of the Golden Gate.  Any one of
these mines was capable of destroying a dozen battleships, and
there were over a hundred mines.  The destruction was terrific, but
it was only Gluck's overture.  He played his flashes down the Mare
Island shore, blowing up five torpedo boats, the torpedo station,
and the great magazine at the eastern end of the island.  Returning
westward again, and scooping in occasional isolated magazines on
the high ground back from the shore, he blew up three cruisers and
the battleships Oregon, Delaware, New Hampshire, and Florida - the
latter had just gone into dry-dock, and the magnificent dry-dock
was destroyed along with her.
<P>
It was a frightful catastrophe, and a shiver of horror passed
through the land.  But it was nothing to what was to follow.  In
the late fall of that year Emil Gluck made a clean sweep of the
Atlantic seaboard from Maine to Florida.  Nothing escaped.  Forts,
mines, coast defences of all sorts, torpedo stations, magazines -
everything went up.  Three months afterward, in midwinter, he smote
the north shore of the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Greece in
the same stupefying manner.  A wail went up from the nations.  It
was clear that human agency was behind all this destruction, and it
was equally clear, through Emil Gluck's impartiality, that the
destruction was not the work of any particular nation.  One thing
was patent, namely, that whoever was the human behind it all, that
human was a menace to the world.  No nation was safe.  There was no
defence against this unknown and all-powerful foe.  Warfare was
futile - nay, not merely futile but itself the very essence of the
peril.  For a twelve-month the manufacture of powder ceased, and
all soldiers and sailors were withdrawn from all fortifications and
war vessels.  And even a world-disarmament was seriously considered
at the Convention of the Powers, held at The Hague at that time.
<P>
And then Silas Bannerman, a secret service agent of the United
States, leaped into world-fame by arresting Emil Gluck.  At first
Bannerman was laughed at, but he had prepared his case well, and in
a few weeks the most sceptical were convinced of Emil Gluck's
guilt.  The one thing, however, that Silas Bannerman never
succeeded in explaining, even to his own satisfaction, was how
first he came to connect Gluck with the atrocious crimes.  It is
true, Bannerman was in Vallejo, on secret government business, at
the time of the destruction of Mare Island; and it is true that on
the streets of Vallejo Emil Gluck was pointed out to him as a queer
crank; but no impression was made at the time.  It was not until
afterward, when on a vacation in the Rocky Mountains and when
reading the first published reports of the destruction along the
Atlantic Coast, that suddenly Bannerman thought of Emil Gluck.  And
on the instant there flashed into his mind the connection between
Gluck and the destruction.  It was only an hypothesis, but it was
sufficient.  The great thing was the conception of the hypothesis,
in itself an act of unconscious cerebration - a thing as
unaccountable as the flashing, for instance, into Newton's mind of
the principle of gravitation.
<P>
The rest was easy.  Where was Gluck at the time of the destruction
along the Atlantic sea-board? was the question that formed in
Bannerman's mind.  By his own request he was put upon the case.  In
no time he ascertained that Gluck had himself been up and down the
Atlantic Coast in the late fall of 1940.  Also he ascertained that
Gluck had been in New York City during the epidemic of the shooting
of police officers.  Where was Gluck now? was Bannerman's next
query.  And, as if in answer, came the wholesale destruction along
the Mediterranean.  Gluck had sailed for Europe a month before -
Bannerman knew that.  It was not necessary for Bannerman to go to
Europe.  By means of cable messages and the co-operation of the
European secret services, he traced Gluck's course along the
Mediterranean and found that in every instance it coincided with
the blowing up of coast defences and ships.  Also, he learned that
Gluck had just sailed on the Green Star liner Plutonic for the
United States.
<P>
The case was complete in Bannerman's mind, though in the interval
of waiting he worked up the details.  In this he was ably assisted
by George Brown, an operator employed by the Wood's System of
Wireless Telegraphy.  When the Plutonic arrived off Sandy Hook she
was boarded by Bannerman from a Government tug, and Emil Gluck was
made a prisoner.  The trial and the confession followed.  In the
confession Gluck professed regret only for one thing, namely, that
he had taken his time.  As he said, had he dreamed that he was ever
to be discovered he would have worked more rapidly and accomplished
a thousand times the destruction he did.  His secret died with him,
though it is now known that the French Government managed to get
access to him and offered him a billion francs for his invention
wherewith he was able to direct and closely to confine electric
discharges.  "What!" was Gluck's reply - "to sell to you that which
would enable you to enslave and maltreat suffering Humanity?"  And
though the war departments of the nations have continued to
experiment in their secret laboratories, they have so far failed to
light upon the slightest trace of the secret.  Emil Gluck was
executed on December 4, 1941, and so died, at the age of forty-six,
one of the world's most unfortunate geniuses, a man of tremendous
intellect, but whose mighty powers, instead of making toward good,
were so twisted and warped that he became the most amazing of
criminals.
