<p><em>FIVE</em></p>

<p>I had gone out into the blackness of the night with a firmer
step, with a new assurance. I had had my interview, the thing
was definitely settled; the first thing in my life that had ever
been definitely settled; and I felt I must tell Lea before I slept.
Lea had helped me a good deal in the old days&mdash;he had helped everybody,
for that matter. You would probably find traces of Lea's influence
in the beginnings of every writer of about my decade; of everybody
who ever did anything decent, and of some who never got beyond
the stage of burgeoning decently. He had given me the material
help that a publisher's reader could give, until his professional
reputation was endangered, and he had given me the more valuable
help that so few can give. I had grown ashamed of this one-sided
friendship. It was, indeed, partly because of that that I had
taken to the wilds&mdash;to a hut near a wood, and all the rest of
what now seemed youthful foolishness. I had desired to live alone,
not to be helped any more, until I could make <em>some</em> return.
As a natural result I had lost nearly all my friends and found
myself standing there as naked as on the day I was born.</p>

<p>All around me stretched an immense town&mdash;an immense blackness.
People&mdash;thousands of people hurried past me, had errands, had
aims, had others to talk to, to trifle with. But I had nobody.
This immense city, this immense blackness, had no interiors for
me. There were house fronts, staring windows, closed doors, but
nothing within; no rooms, no hollow places. The houses meant nothing
to me, nothing more than the solid earth. Lea remained the only
one the thought of whom was not like the reconsideration of an
ancient, a musty pair of gloves.</p>

<p>He lived just anywhere. Being a publisher's reader, he had to
report upon the probable commercial value of the manuscripts that
unknown authors sent to his employer, and I suppose he had a settled
plan of life, of the sort that brought him within the radius of
a given spot at apparently irregular, but probably ordered, intervals.
It seemed to be no more than a piece of good luck that let me
find him that night in a little room in one of the by-ways of
Bloomsbury. He was sprawling angularly on a cane lounge, surrounded
by whole rubbish heaps of manuscript, a grey scrawl in a foam
of soiled paper. He peered up at me as I stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he said, "what's brought you here? Have a manuscript?"
He waved an abstracted hand round him. "You'll find a chair somewhere."
A claret bottle stood on the floor beside him. He took it by the
neck and passed it to me.</p>

<p>He bent his head again and continued his reading. I displaced
three bulky folio sheaves of typewritten matter from a chair and
seated myself behind him. He continued to read.</p>

<p>"I hadn't seen these rooms before," I said, for want of something
to say.</p>

<p>The room was not so much scantily as arbitrarily furnished. It
contained a big mahogany sideboard; a common deal table, an extraordinary
kind of folding wash-hand-stand; a deal bookshelf, the cane lounge,
and three unrelated chairs. There were three framed Dutch prints
on the marble mantel-shelf; striped curtains before the windows.
A square, cheap looking-glass, with a razor above it, hung between
them. And on the floor, on the chairs, on the sideboard, on the
unmade bed, the profusion of manuscripts.</p>

<p>He scribbled something on a blue paper and began to roll a cigarette.
He took off his glasses, rubbed them, and closed his eyes tightly.</p>

<p>"Well, and how's Sussex?" he asked.</p>

<p>I felt a sudden attack of what, essentially, was nostalgia. The
fact that I was really leaving an old course of life, was actually
and finally breaking with it, became vividly apparent. Lea, you
see, stood for what was best in the mode of thought that I was
casting aside. He stood for the aspiration. The brooding, the
moodiness; all the childish qualities, were my own importations.
I was a little ashamed to tell him, that&mdash;that I was going to
live, in fact. Some of the glory of it had gone, as if one of
two candles I had been reading by had flickered out. But I told
him, after a fashion, that I had got a job at last.</p>

<p>"Oh, I congratulate you," he said.</p>

<p>"You see," I began to combat the objections he had not had time
to utter, "even for my work it will be a good thing &mdash;I wasn't
seeing enough of life to be able to...."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not," he answered&mdash;"it'll be a good thing. You
must have been having a pretty bad time."</p>

<p>It struck me as abominably unfair. I hadn't taken up with the
<em>Hour</em> because I was tired of having a bad time, but for
other reasons: because I had felt my soul being crushed within
me.</p>

<p>"You're mistaken," I said. And I explained. He answered, "Yes,
yes," but I fancied that he was adding to himself&mdash;"They all say
that." I grew more angry. Lea's opinion formed, to some extent,
the background of my life. For many years I had been writing quite
as much to satisfy him as to satisfy myself, and his coldness
chilled me. He thought that my heart was not in my work, and I
did not want Lea to think that of me. I tried to explain as much
to him&mdash;but it was difficult, and he gave me no help.</p>

<p>I knew there had been others that he had fostered, only to see
them, in the end, drift into the back-wash. And now he thought
I was going too....</p>

<p>"Here," he said, suddenly breaking away from the subject, "look
at that."</p>

<p>He threw a heavy, ribbon-bound mass of matter into my lap, and
recommenced writing his report upon its saleability as a book.
He was of opinion that it was too delicately good to attract his
employer's class of readers. I began to read it to get rid of
my thoughts. The heavy black handwriting of the manuscript sticks
in my mind's eye. It must have been good, but probably not so
good as I then thought it &mdash;I have entirely forgotten all
about it; otherwise, I remember that we argued afterward: I for
its publication; he against. I was thinking of the wretched author
whose fate hung in the balance. He became a pathetic possibility,
hidden in the heart of the white paper that bore pen-markings
of a kind too good to be marketable. There was something appalling
in Lea's careless&mdash;"Oh, it's too good!" He was used to it, but
as for me, in arguing that man's case I suddenly became aware
that I was pleading my own&mdash;pleading the case of my better work.
Everything that Lea said of this work, of this man, applied to
my work; and to myself. "There's no market for that sort of thing,
no public; this book's been all round the trade. I've had it before.
The man will never come to the front. He'll take to inn-keeping,
and that will finish him off." That's what he said, and he seemed
to be speaking of me. Some one was knocking at the door of the
room&mdash;tentative knocks of rather flabby knuckles. It was one of
those sounds that one does not notice immediately. The man might
have been knocking for ten minutes. It happened to be Lea's employer,
the publisher of my first book. He opened the door at last, and
came in rather peremptorily. He had the air of having worked himself
into a temper&mdash;of being intellectually rather afraid of Lea, but
of being, for this occasion, determined to assert himself.</p>

<p>The introduction to myself &mdash;I had never met him&mdash;which
took place after he had hastily brought out half a sentence or
so, had the effect of putting him out of his stride, but, after
having remotely acknowledged the possibility of my existence,
he began again.</p>

<p>The matter was one of some delicacy. I myself should have hesitated
to broach it before a third party, even one so negligible as myself.
But Mr. Polehampton apparently did not. He had to catch the last
post.</p>

<p>Lea, it appeared, had advised him to publish a manuscript by
a man called Howden&mdash;a moderately known writer....</p>

<p>"But I am disturbed to find, Mr. Lea, that is, my daughter tells
me that the manuscript is not ... is not at all the thing....
In fact, it's quite&mdash;and&mdash;eh ... I suppose it's too late to draw
back?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's altogether too late for <em>that</em>" Lea said, nonchalantly.
"Besides, Howden's theories always sell."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course, of course," Mr. Polehampton interjected,
hastily, "but don't you think now ... I mean, taking into consideration
the damage it may do our reputation ... that we ought to ask Mr.
Howden to accept, say fifty pounds less than...."</p>

<p>"I should think it's an excellent idea," Lea said. Mr. Polehampton
glanced at him suspiciously, then turned to me.</p>

<p>"You see," he began to explain, "one has to be <em>so</em> careful
about these things."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can quite understand," I answered. There was something
so na√Øve in the man's point of view that I had felt my heart go
out to him. And he had taught me at last how it is that the godly
grow fat at the expense of the unrighteous. Mr. Polehampton, however,
was not fat. He was even rather thin, and his peaked grey hair,
though it was actually well brushed, looked as if it ought not
to have been. He had even an anxious expression. People said he
speculated in some stock or other, and I should say they were
right.</p>

<p>"I ... eh ... believe I published your first book ... I lost
money by it, but I can assure you that I bear no grudge&mdash;almost
a hundred pounds. I bear no grudge...."</p>

<p>The man was an original. He had no idea that I might feel insulted;
indeed, he really wanted to be pleasant, and condescending, and
forgiving. I didn't feel insulted. He was too big for his clothes,
gave that impression at least, and he wore black kid gloves. Moreover,
his eyes never left the cornice of the room. I saw him rather
often after that night, but never without his gloves and never
with his eyes lowered.</p>

<p>"And ... eh ..." he asked, "what are you doing now, Mr. Granger?"</p>

<p>Lea told him Fox had taken me up; that I was going to go. I suddenly
remembered it was said of Fox that everyone he took up did "go."
The fact was obviously patent to Mr. Polehampton. He unbent with
remarkable suddenness; it reminded me of the abrupt closing of
a stiff umbrella. He became distinctly and crudely cordial&mdash;hoped
that we should work together again; once more reminded me that
he had published my first book (the words had a different savour
now), and was enchanted to discover that we were neighbours in
Sussex. My cottage was within four miles of his villa, and we
were members of the same golf club.</p>

<p>"We must have a game&mdash;several games," he said. He struck me as
the sort of man to find a difficulty in getting anyone to play
with him.</p>

<p>After that he went away. As I had said, I did not dislike him&mdash;he
was pathetic; but his tone of mind, his sudden change of front,
unnerved me. It proved so absolutely that I was "going to go,"
and I did not want to go&mdash;in that sense. The thing is a little
difficult to explain, I wanted to take the job because I wanted
to have money&mdash;for a little time, for a year or so, but if I once
began to go, the temptation would be strong to keep on going,
and I was by no means sure that I should be able to resist the
temptation. So many others had failed. What if I wrote to Fox,
and resigned?... Lea was deep in a manuscript once more.</p>

<p>"Shall I throw it up?" I asked suddenly. I wanted the thing settled.</p>

<p>"Oh, go on with it, by all means go on with it," Lea answered.</p>

<p>"And ...?" I postulated.</p>

<p>"Take your chance of the rest," he supplied; "you've had a pretty
bad time."</p>

<p>"I suppose," I reflected, "if I haven't got the strength of mind
to get out of it in time, I'm not up to much."</p>

<p>"There's that, too," he commented, "the game may not be worth
the candle." I was silent. "You must take your chance when you
get it," he added.</p>

<p>He had resumed his reading, but he looked up again when I gave
way, as I did after a moment's thought.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, "it will probably be all right. You do
your best. It's a good thing ... might even do you good."</p>

<p>In that way the thing went through. As I was leaving the room,
the idea occurred to me, "By the way, you don't know anything
of a clique: the Dimensionists&mdash;<em>Fourth</em> Dimensionists?"</p>

<p>"Never heard of them," he negatived. "What's their specialty?"</p>

<p>"They're going to inherit the earth," I answered.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish them joy," he closed.</p>

<p>"You don't happen to be one yourself? I believe it's a sort of
secret society." He wasn't listening. I went out quietly.</p>

<p>The night effects of that particular neighbourhood have always
affected me dismally. That night they upset me, upset me in much
the same way, acting on much the same nerves as the valley in
which I had walked with that puzzling girl. I remembered that
she had said she stood for the future, that she was a symbol of
my own decay&mdash;the whole silly farrago, in fact. I reasoned with
myself&mdash;that I was tired, out of trim, and so on, that I was in
a fit state to be at the mercy of any nightmare. I plunged into
Southampton Row. There was safety in the contact with the crowd,
in jostling, in being jostled.</p>
