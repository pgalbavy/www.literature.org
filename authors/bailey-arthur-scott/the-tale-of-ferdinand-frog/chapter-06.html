<p>In spite of all Ferdinand Frog's teasing, Tired Tim Beaver refused to
explain how he happened to know Mr. Frog's secret.
</p>
<p>To tell the truth, he had <u>guessed</u> the reason why Mr. Frog did not
attend the Cedar Swamp singing-parties. But he hoped that Ferdinand Frog
would think that some of the musical Frog family had been talking to
him. And he even hinted to Mr. Frog that maybe it would be possible to
get him an invitation to the singing-parties.
</p><p>"Do you think you could do that?" Ferdinand Frog asked him with, great
eagerness.
</p><p>"I <u>might</u> be able to; but it wouldn't be an easy matter," Tired Tim
replied. "And I'd expect you to do something for me, if I went to so
much trouble on your account."
</p><p>"I'll do <u>anything</u> for you, in return for an invitation to the Cedar
Swamp singing-parties," Ferdinand Frog declared.
</p><p>"Very well!" Tired Tim told him. "I'll go right over to the swamp now.
And when I tell 'em a few things, I know they'll want you to join 'em."
</p><p>Ferdinand Frog felt so gay that he stood on his head and waved his feet
in the air.
</p><p>"Let's meet here to-morrow night," he suggested.
</p><p>But Tired Tim objected to that plan.
</p><p>"You would be hanging about this place--and singing--for four-and-twenty
hours," he grumbled. "It will be a great deal better if we meet on the
edge of the swamp."
</p><p>"Just as you wish!" Ferdinand Frog exclaimed. "And since you're going to
Cedar Swamp, I'll hop along with you, to keep you company."
</p><p>"You forget----" said Tired Tim Beaver----"you forget that you haven't
been invited yet."
</p><p>"Have you?" Mr. Frog inquired.
</p><p>"Certainly!" said Tired Tim. And grinning over his shoulder, he swam
away.
</p><p>Mr. Frog watched his friend from the shore.
</p><p>"He can't fool me," he muttered. "Tired Tim <u>invited himself</u>. And I've
been stupid not to do likewise."
</p><p>On the following night Ferdinand Frog went to the edge of Cedar Swamp,
where he waited somewhat impatiently on a log until Tired Tim Beaver
joined him.
</p><p>"Well!" Mr. Frog cried. "I'm glad to see you and I hope you've brought
my invitation."
</p><p>But Tired Tim wouldn't say yes or no.
</p><p>"If I succeed in getting you into the Cedar Swamp singing-parties will
you promise me that you won't sing any more around the lake, or near our
pond, either?" he demanded.
</p><p>Ferdinand Frog gave his solemn promise.
</p><p>"Very well, then!" Tired Tim said. "Go along over to the swamp. They're
expecting you."
</p><p>When he heard the good news Ferdinand Frog was so delighted that he
leaped into the air and kicked his heels together.
</p><p>And then forgetting his solemn promise, he began to bellow at the top of
his voice:
</p><pre>
        "To Cedar Swamp I'll haste away;
           Though first I'll sing a song.
         My voice I must not waste to-day,
           So I'll not keep you long.
         I simply want to let you know
           I'm much obliged, before I go."</pre>
<p>"Don't mention it!" said Tired Tim.
</p><p>"Don't interrupt me, please!" said Ferdinand Frog. "I haven't finished
thanking you yet. That's only the first verse."
</p><p>"How many more are there?" Tired Tim inquired with a yawn.
</p><p>"Ninety-nine!" Mr. Frog answered. And he was somewhat surprised--and
puzzled--when Tired Tim left him suddenly and plunged into the
underbrush.
