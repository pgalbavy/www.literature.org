<p>A grand debate at the general assembly of the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>,
and how it was determined.  The learning of the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>. 
Their buildings. Their manner of burials.  The defectiveness of
their language.</p>

<p>One of these grand assemblies was held in my time, about three
months before my departure, whither my master went as the representative
of our district.  In this council was resumed their old debate,
and indeed the only debate that ever happened in their country;
whereof my master, after his return, give me a very particular
account.</p>

<p>The question to be debated was, "whether the <em>Yahoos</em>
should be exterminated from the face of the earth?"  One of the
members for the affirmative offered several arguments of great
strength and weight, alleging, "that as the <em>Yahoos</em> were
the most filthy, noisome, and deformed animals which nature ever
produced, so they were the most restive and indocible, mischievous
and malicious; they would privately suck the teats of the <em>Houyhnhnmsâ€™</em>
cows, kill and devour their cats, trample down their oats and
grass, if they were not continually watched, and commit a thousand
other extravagancies."  He took notice of a general tradition,
"that <em>Yahoos</em> had not been always in their country; but
that many ages ago, two of these brutes appeared together upon
a mountain; whether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted
mud and slime, or from the ooze and froth of the sea, was never
known; that these <em>Yahoos</em> engendered, and their brood,
in a short time, grew so numerous as to overrun and infest the
whole nation; that the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>, to get rid of this
evil, made a general hunting, and at last enclosed the whole herd;
and destroying the elder, every <em>Houyhnhnm</em> kept two young
ones in a kennel, and brought them to such a degree of tameness,
as an animal, so savage by nature, can be capable of acquiring,
using them for draught and carriage; that there seemed to be much
truth in this tradition, and that those creatures could not be
<em>yinhniamshy</em> (or <em>aborigines</em> of the land), because
of the violent hatred the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>, as well as all
other animals, bore them, which, although their evil disposition
sufficiently deserved, could never have arrived at so high a degree
if they had been <em>aborigines</em>, or else they would have
long since been rooted out; that the inhabitants, taking a fancy
to use the service of the <em>Yahoos</em>, had, very imprudently,
neglected to cultivate the breed of asses, which are a comely
animal, easily kept, more tame and orderly, without any offensive
smell, strong enough for labour, although they yield to the other
in agility of body, and if their braying be no agreeable sound,
it is far preferable to the horrible howlings of the <em>Yahoos</em>."</p>

<p>Several others declared their sentiments to the same purpose,
when my master proposed an expedient to the assembly, whereof
he had indeed borrowed the hint from me.  "He approved of the
tradition mentioned by the honourable member who spoke before,
and affirmed, that the two <em>Yahoos</em> said to be seen first
among them, had been driven thither over the sea; that coming
to land, and being forsaken by their companions, they retired
to the mountains, and degenerating by degrees, became in process
of time much more savage than those of their own species in the
country whence these two originals came.  The reason of this assertion
was, that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful <em>Yahoo</em>
(meaning myself) which most of them had heard of, and many of
them had seen.  He then related to them how he first found me;
that my body was all covered with an artificial composure of the
skins and hairs of other animals; that I spoke in a language of
my own, and had thoroughly learned theirs; that I had related
to him the accidents which brought me thither; that when he saw
me without my covering, I was an exact <em>Yahoo</em> in every
part, only of a whiter colour, less hairy, and with shorter claws. 
He added, how I had endeavoured to persuade him, that in my own
and other countries, the <em>Yahoos</em> acted as the governing,
rational animal, and held the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> in servitude;
that he observed in me all the qualities of a <em>Yahoo</em>,
only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason, which,
however, was in a degree as far inferior to the <em>Houyhnhnm</em>
race, as the <em>Yahoos</em> of their country were to me; that,
among other things, I mentioned a custom we had of castrating
<em>Houyhnhnms</em> when they were young, in order to render them
tame; that the operation was easy and safe; that it was no shame
to learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is taught by the ant,
and building by the swallow (for so I translate the word <em>lyhannh</em>,
although it be a much larger fowl); that this invention might
be practised upon the younger <em>Yahoos</em> here, which besides
rendering them tractable and fitter for use, would in an age put
an end to the whole species, without destroying life; that in
the mean time the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> should be exhorted to cultivate
the breed of asses, which, as they are in all respects more valuable
brutes, so they have this advantage, to be fit for service at
five years old, which the others are not till twelve."</p>

<p>This was all my master thought fit to tell me, at that time,
of what passed in the grand council.  But he was pleased to conceal
one particular, which related personally to myself, whereof I
soon felt the unhappy effect, as the reader will know in its proper
place, and whence I date all the succeeding misfortunes of my
life.</p>

<p>The <em>Houyhnhnms</em> have no letters, and consequently their
knowledge is all traditional.  But there happening few events
of any moment among a people so well united, naturally disposed
to every virtue, wholly governed by reason, and cut off from all
commerce with other nations, the historical part is easily preserved
without burdening their memories.  I have already observed that
they are subject to no diseases, and therefore can have no need
of physicians.  However, they have excellent medicines, composed
of herbs, to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern or
frog of the foot, by sharp stones, as well as other maims and
hurts in the several parts of the body.</p>

<p>They calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and moon,
but use no subdivisions into weeks.  They are well enough acquainted
with the motions of those two luminaries, and understand the nature
of eclipses; and this is the utmost progress of their astronomy.</p>

<p>In poetry, they must be allowed to excel all other mortals; wherein
the justness of their similes, and the minuteness as well as exactness
of their descriptions, are indeed inimitable.  Their verses abound
very much in both of these, and usually contain either some exalted
notions of friendship and benevolence or the praises of those
who were victors in races and other bodily exercises.  Their buildings,
although very rude and simple, are not inconvenient, but well
contrived to defend them from all injuries of cold and heat. 
They have a kind of tree, which at forty years old loosens in
the root, and falls with the first storm: it grows very straight,
and being pointed like stakes with a sharp stone (for the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>
know not the use of iron), they stick them erect in the ground,
about ten inches asunder, and then weave in oat straw, or sometimes
wattles, between them.  The roof is made after the same manner,
and so are the doors.</p>

<p>The <em>Houyhnhnms</em> use the hollow part, between the pastern
and the hoof of their fore-foot, as we do our hands, and this
with greater dexterity than I could at first imagine.  I have
seen a white mare of our family thread a needle (which I lent
her on purpose) with that joint.  They milk their cows, reap their
oats, and do all the work which requires hands, in the same manner. 
They have a kind of hard flints, which, by grinding against other
stones, they form into instruments, that serve instead of wedges,
axes, and hammers.  With tools made of these flints, they likewise
cut their hay, and reap their oats, which there grow naturally
in several fields; the <em>Yahoos</em> draw home the sheaves in
carriages, and the servants tread them in certain covered huts
to get out the grain, which is kept in stores.  They make a rude
kind of earthen and wooden vessels, and bake the former in the
sun.</p>

<p>If they can avoid casualties, they die only of old age, and are
buried in the obscurest places that can be found, their friends
and relations expressing neither joy nor grief at their departure;
nor does the dying person discover the least regret that he is
leaving the world, any more than if he were upon returning home
from a visit to one of his neighbours.  I remember my master having
once made an appointment with a friend and his family to come
to his house, upon some affair of importance: on the day fixed,
the mistress and her two children came very late; she made two
excuses, first for her husband, who, as she said, happened that
very morning to <em>shnuwnh</em>.  The word is strongly expressive
in their language, but not easily rendered into English; it signifies,
"to retire to his first mother."  Her excuse for not coming sooner,
was, that her husband dying late in the morning, she was a good
while consulting her servants about a convenient place where his
body should be laid; and I observed, she behaved herself at our
house as cheerfully as the rest.  She died about three months
after.</p>

<p>They live generally to seventy, or seventy-five years, very seldom
to fourscore.  Some weeks before their death, they feel a gradual
decay; but without pain.  During this time they are much visited
by their friends, because they cannot go abroad with their usual
ease and satisfaction. However, about ten days before their death,
which they seldom fail in computing, they return the visits that
have been made them by those who are nearest in the neighbourhood,
being carried in a convenient sledge drawn by <em>Yahoos</em>;
which vehicle they use, not only upon this occasion, but when
they grow old, upon long journeys, or when they are lamed by any
accident: and therefore when the dying <em>Houyhnhnms</em> return
those visits, they take a solemn leave of their friends, as if
they were going to some remote part of the country, where they
designed to pass the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>I know not whether it may be worth observing, that the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>
have no word in their language to express any thing that is evil,
except what they borrow from the deformities or ill qualities
of the <em>Yahoos</em>.  Thus they denote the folly of a servant,
an omission of a child, a stone that cuts their feet, a continuance
of foul or unseasonable weather, and the like, by adding to each
the epithet of <em>Yahoo</em>.  For instance, <em>hhnm Yahoo</em>;
<em>whnaholm Yahoo</em>, <em>ynlhmndwihlma Yahoo</em>, and an
ill-contrived house <em>ynholmhnmrohlnw Yahoo</em>.</p>

<p>I could, with great pleasure, enlarge further upon the manners
and virtues of this excellent people; but intending in a short
time to publish a volume by itself, expressly upon that subject,
I refer the reader thither; and, in the mean time, proceed to
relate my own sad catastrophe.</p>
