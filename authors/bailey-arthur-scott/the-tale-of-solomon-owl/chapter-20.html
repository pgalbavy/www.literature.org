<p>In the woods there was hardly one of Solomon Owl’s neighbors that couldn’t
point out the big hemlock tree where he lived. And mischievous fellows
like Reddy Woodpecker sometimes annoyed Solomon a good deal by rapping
loudly on his door. When he thrust his head angrily out of his house and
blinked in the sunlight, his tormentors would skip away and laugh. They
laughed because they knew that they had awakened Solomon Owl. And they
dodged out of his reach because he was always ill-tempered when anybody
disturbed his rest in the daytime.
</p>
<p>Solomon Owl did not mind so <u>very</u> much so long as that trick was not
played on him too often. But after a time it became one of Reddy
Woodpecker’s favorite sports. Not only once, but several times a day did
he go to the hemlock grove to hammer upon Solomon’s hollow tree. And each
time that he brought Solomon Owl to his door Reddy Woodpecker laughed more
loudly than ever before.
</p><p>Once Solomon forgot to take off his nightcap (though he wore it in the
daytime, it really was a nightcap). And Reddy Woodpecker was so amused
that he shouted at the top of his lungs.
</p><p>“What’s the joke?” asked Solomon Owl in his deep, rumbling voice. He tried
to look very severe. But it is hard to look any way except funny with a
nightcap on one’s head.
</p><p>As luck had it, Jasper Jay came hurrying up just then. He had heard Reddy
Woodpecker’s laughter. And if there was a joke he wanted to enjoy it, too.
</p><p>Jasper Jay, alighting in a small hemlock near Reddy Woodpecker, asked the
same question that Solomon Owl had just put to his rude caller.
</p><p>“What’s the joke?” inquired Jasper Jay.
</p><p>Reddy could not speak. He was rocking back and forth upon a limb, choking
and gasping for breath. But he managed to point to the big tree where
Solomon Owl lived.
</p><p>And when Jasper looked, and saw Solomon’s great, round, pale, questioning
face, all tied up in a red nightcap, he began to scream.
</p><p>They were no ordinary screams—those shrieks of Jasper Jay’s. That
blue-coated rascal was the noisiest of all the feathered folk in Pleasant
Valley. And now he fairly made the woods echo with his hoarse cries.
</p><p>“This is the funniest sight I’ve ever seen!” Jasper Jay said at last, to
nobody in particular. “I declare, there’s a pair of them!”
</p><p>At that, Reddy Woodpecker suddenly stopped laughing.
</p><p>“A pair of what?” he asked.
</p><p>“A pair of red-heads, of course!” Jasper Jay replied. “You’ve a red
cap—and so has he!” Jasper pointed at Solomon Owl (a very rude thing to
do!).
</p><p>Then two things happened all at once. Solomon Owl snatched off his red
night-cap—which he had quite forgotten. And Reddy Woodpecker dashed at
Jasper Jay. He couldn’t pull off <u>his</u> red cap, for it grew right on his
head.
</p><p>“So that’s what you’re laughing at, is it?” he cried angrily. And then
nobody laughed any more—that is, nobody but Solomon Owl.
</p><p>Solomon was so pleased by the fight that followed between Jasper Jay and
Reddy Woodpecker that his deep, rumbling laughter could be heard for half
an hour—even if it <u>was</u> midday. “_Wha-wha! Whoo-ah!_” The sound reached
the ears of Farmer Green, who was just crossing a neighboring field, on
his way home to dinner.
</p><p>“Well, well!” he exclaimed. “I wonder what’s happened to that old owl!
Something must have tickled him—for I never heard an owl laugh in broad
daylight before.”
