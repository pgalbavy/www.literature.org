<P>
HARDYMAN went on to the cottage. He found Isabel in some
agitation. And there, by her side, with his tail wagging slowly,
and his eye on Hardyman in expectation of a possible kick--there
was the lost Tommie!
<P>
"Has Lady Lydiard gone?" Isabel asked eagerly.
<P>
"Yes," said Hardyman. "Where did you find the dog?"
<P>
As events had ordered it, the dog had found Isabel, under these
circumstances.
<P>
The appearance of Lady Lydiard's card in the smoking-room had
been an alarming event for Lady Lydiard's adopted daughter. She
was guiltily conscious of not having answered her Ladyship's
note, inclosed in Miss Pink's letter, and of not having taken her
Ladyship's advice in regulating her conduct towards Hardyman. As
he rose to leave the room and receive his visitor in the grounds,
Isabel begged him to say nothing of her presence at the farm,
unless Lady Lydiard exhibited a forgiving turn of mind by asking
to see her. Left by herself in the smoking-room, she suddenly
heard a bark in the passage which had a familiar sound in her
ears. She opened the door--and in rushed Tommie, with one of his
shrieks of delight! Curiosity had taken him into the house. He
had heard the voices in the smoking-room; had recognized Isabel's
voice; and had waited, with his customary cunning and his
customary distrust of strangers, until Hardyman was out of the
way. Isabel kissed and caressed him, and then drove him out again
to the lawn, fearing that Lady Lydiard might return to look for
him. Going back to the smoking-room, she stood at the window
watching for Hardyman's return. When the servants came to look
for the dog, she could only tell them that she had last seen him
in the grounds, not far from the cottage. The useless search
being abandoned, and the carriage having left the gate, who
should crawl out from the back of a cupboard in which some empty
hampers were placed but Tommie himself! How he had contrived to
get back to the smoking-room (unless she had omitted to
completely close the door on her return) it was impossible to
say. But there he was, determined this time to stay with Isabel,
and keeping in his hiding place until he heard the movement of
the carriage-wheels, which informed him that his lawful mistress
had left the cottage! Isabel had at once called Hardyman, on the
chance that the carriage might yet be stopped. It was already out
of sight, and nobody knew which of two roads it had taken, both
leading to London. In this emergency, Isabel could only look at
Hardyman and ask what was to be done.
<P>
"I can't spare a servant till after the party," he answered. "The
dog must be tied up in the stables."
<P>
Isabel shook her head. Tommie was not accustomed to be tied up.
He would make a disturbance, and he would be beaten by the
grooms. "I will take care of him," she said. "He won't leave me."
<P>
"There's something else to think of besides the dog," Hardyman
rejoined irritably. "Look at these letters!" He pulled them out
of his pocket as he spoke. "Here are no less than seven men, all
calling themselves my friends, who accepted my invitation, and
who write to excuse themselves on the very day of the party. Do
you know why? They're all afraid of my father--I forgot to tell
you he's a Cabinet Minister as well as a Lord. Cowards and cads.
They have heard he isn't coming and they think to curry favor
with the great man by stopping away. Come along, Isabel! Let's
take their names off the luncheon table. Not a man of them shall
ever darken my doors again!"
<P>
"I am to blame for what has happened," Isabel answered sadly. "I
am estranging you from your friends. There is still time, Alfred,
to alter your mind and let me go."
<P>
He put his arm round her with rough fondness. "I would sacrifice
every friend I have in the world rather than lose you. Come
along!"
<P>
They left the cottage. At the entrance to the tent, Hardyman
noticed the dog at Isabel's heels, and vented his ill-temper, as
usual with male humanity, on the nearest unoffending creature
that he could find. "Be off, you mongrel brute!" he shouted. The
tail of Tommie relaxed from its customary tight curve over the
small of his back; and the legs of Tommie (with his tail between
them) took him at full gallop to the friendly shelter of the
cupboard in the smoking-room. It was one of those trifling
circumstances which women notice seriously. Isabel said nothing;
she only thought to herself, "I wish he had shown his temper when
I first knew him!"
<P>
They entered the tent.
<P>
"I'll read the names," said Hardyman, "and you find the cards and
tear them up. Stop! I'll keep the cards. You're just the sort of
woman my father likes. He'll be reconciled to me when he sees
you, after we are married. If one of those men ever asks him for
a place, I'll take care, if it's years hence, to put an obstacle
in his way! Here; take my pencil, and make a mark on the cards to
remind me; the same mark I set against a horse in my book when I
don't like him--a cross, inclosed in a circle." He produced his
pocketbook. His hands trembled with anger as he gave the pencil
to Isabel and laid the book on the table. He had just read the
name of the first false friend, and Isabel had just found the
card, when a servant appeared with a message. "Mrs. Drumblade has
arrived, sir, and wishes to see you on a matter of the greatest
importance."
<P>
Hardyman left the tent, not very willingly. "Wait here," he said
to Isabel; "I'll be back directly."
<P>
She was standing near her own place at the table. Moody had left
one end of the jeweler's case visible above the napkin, to
attract her attention. In a minute more the bracelet and note
were in her hands. She dropped on her chair, overwhelmed by the
conflicting emotions that rose in her at
 the sight of the bracelet, at the reading of the note. Her head
drooped, and the tears filled her eyes. "Are all women as blind
as I have been to what is good and noble in the men who love
them?" she wondered, sadly. "Better as it is," she thought, with
a bitter sigh; "I am not worthy of him."
<P>
As she took up the pencil to write her answer to Moody on the
back of her dinner-card, the servant appeared again at the door
of the tent.
<P>
"My master wants you at the cottage, miss, immediately."
<P>
Isabel rose, putting the bracelet and the note in the
silver-mounted leather pocket (a present from Hardyman) which
hung at her belt. In the hurry of passing round the table to get
out, she never noticed that her dress touched Hardyman's
pocketbook, placed close to the edge, and threw it down on the
grass below. The book fell into one of the heat cracks which Lady
Lydiard had noticed as evidence of the neglected condition of the
cottage lawn.
<P>
"You ought to hear the pleasant news my sister has just brought
me," said Hardyman, when Isabel joined him in the parlor. "Mrs.
Drumblade has been told, on the best authority, that my mother is
not coming to the party."
<P>
"There must be some reason, of course, dear Isabel," added Mrs.
Drumblade. "Have you any idea of what it can be? I haven't seen
my mother myself; and all my inquiries have failed to find it
out."
<P>
She looked searchingly at Isabel as she spoke. The mask of
sympathy on her face was admirably worn. Nobody who possessed
only a superficial acquaintance with Mrs. Drumblade's character
would have suspected how thoroughly she was enjoying in secret
the position of embarrassment in which her news had placed her
brother. Instinctively doubting whether Mrs. Drumblade's friendly
behavior was quite as sincere as it appeared to be, Isabel
answered that she was a stranger to Lady Rotherfield, and was
therefore quite at a loss to explain the cause of her ladyship's
absence. As she spoke, the guests began to arrive in quick
succession, and the subject was dropped as a matter of course.
<P>
It was not a merry party. Hardyman's approaching marriage had
been made the topic of much malicious gossip, and Isabel's
character had, as usual in such cases, become the object of all
the false reports that scandal could invent. Lady Rotherfield's
absence confirmed the general conviction that Hardyman was
disgracing himself. The men were all more or less uneasy. The
women resented the discovery that Isabel was--personally
speaking, at least--beyond the reach of hostile criticism. Her
beauty was viewed as a downright offense; her refined and modest
manners were set down as perfect acting; "really disgusting, my
dear, in so young a girl." General Drumblade, a large and mouldy
veteran, in a state of chronic astonishment (after his own
matrimonial experience) at Hardyman's folly in marrying at all,
diffused a wide circle of gloom, wherever he went and whatever he
did. His accomplished wife, forcing her high spirits on
everybody's attention with a sort of kittenish playfulness,
intensified the depressing effect of the general dullness by all
the force of the strongest contrast. After waiting half an hour
for his mother, and waiting in vain, Hardyman led the way to the
tent in despair. "The sooner I fill their stomachs and get rid of
them," he thought savagely, "the better I shall be pleased!"
<P>
The luncheon was attacked by the company with a certain silent
ferocity, which the waiters noticed as remarkable, even in their
large experience. The men drank deeply, but with wonderfully
little effect in raising their spirits; the women, with the
exception of amiable Mrs. Drumblade, kept Isabel deliberately out
of the conversation that went on among them. General Drumblade,
sitting next to her in one of the places of honor, discoursed to
Isabel privately on "my brother-in-law Hardyman's infernal
temper." A young marquis, on her other side--a mere lad, chosen
to make the necessary speech in acknowledgment of his superior
rank--rose, in a state of nervous trepidation, to propose
Isabel's health as the chosen bride of their host. Pale and
trembling, conscious of having forgotten the words which he had
learnt beforehand, this unhappy young nobleman began: "Ladies and
gentlemen, I haven't an idea--" He stopped, put his hand to his
head, stared wildly, and sat down again; having contrived to
state his own case with masterly brevity and perfect truth, in a
speech of seven words.
<P>
While the dismay, in some cases, and the amusement in others, was
still at its height, Hardyman's valet made his appearance, and,
approaching his master, said in a whisper, "Could I speak to you,
sit, for a moment outside?"
<P>
"What the devil do you want?" Hardyman asked irritably. "Is that
a letter in your hand? Give it to me."
<P>
The valet was a Frenchman. In other words, he had a sense of what
was due to himself. His master had forgotten this. He gave up the
letter with a certain dignity of manner, and left the tent.
Hardyman opened the letter. He turned pale as he read it;
crumpled it in his hand, and threw it down on the table. "By
G--d! it's a lie!" he exclaimed furiously.
<P>
The guests rose in confusion. Mrs. Drumblade, finding the letter
within her reach, coolly possessed herself of it; recognized her
mother's handwriting; and read these lines:
<P>
"I have only now succeeded in persuading your father to let me
write to you. For God's sake, break off your marriage at any
sacrifice. Your father has heard, on unanswerable authority, that
Miss Isabel Miller left her situation in Lady Lydiard's house on
suspicion of theft."
<P>
While his sister was reading this letter, Hardyman had made his
way to Isabel's chair. "I must speak to you, directly," he
whispered. "Come away with me!" He turned, as he took her arm,
and looked at the table. "Where is my letter?" he asked. Mrs.
Drumblade handed it to him, dexterously crumpled up again as she
had found it. "No bad news, dear Alfred, I hope?" she said, in
her most affectionate manner. Hardyman snatched the letter from
her, without answering, and led Isabel out of the tent.
<P>
"Read that!" he said, when they were alone. "And tell me at once
whether it's true or false."
<P>
Isabel read the letter. For a moment the shock of the discovery
held her speechless. She recovered herself, and returned the
letter.
<P>
"It is true," she answered.
<P>
Hardyman staggered back as if she had shot him.
<P>
"True that you are guilty?" he asked.
<P>
"No; I am innocent. Everybody who knows me believes in my
innocence. It is true the appearances were against me. They are
against me still." Having said this, she waited, quietly and
firmly, for his next words.
<P>
He passed his hand over his forehead with a sigh of relief. "It's
bad enough as it is," he said, speaking quietly on his side. "But
the remedy for it is plain enough. Come back to the tent."
<P>
She never moved. "Why?" she asked.
<P>
"Do you suppose I don't believe in your innocence too?" he
answered. "The one way of setting you right with the world now is
for me to make you my wife, in spite of the appearances that
point to you. I'm too fond of you, Isabel, to give you up. Come
back with me, and I will announce our marriage to my friends."
<P>
She took his hand, and kissed it. "It is generous and good of
you," she said; "but it must not be."
<P>
He took a step nearer to her. "What do you mean?" he asked.
<P>
"It was against my will," she pursued, "that my aunt concealed
the truth from you. I did wrong to consent to it, I will do wrong
no more. Your mother is right, Alfred. After what has happened, I
am not fit to be your wife until my innocence is proved. It is
not proved yet."
<P>
The angry color began to rise in his face once more. "Take care,"
he said; "I am not in a humor to be trifled with."
<P>
"I am not trifling with you," she answered, in low, sad tones.
<P>
"You really mean what you say?"
<P>
"I mean it."
<P>
"Don't be obstinate, Isabel. Take time to consider."
<P>
"You are very kind, Alfred. My duty is plain to me. I will marry
you--if you still wish it--when my good name is restored to me.
Not before."
<P>
He laid one hand on her arm, and pointed with the other to the
guests in the distance, all leaving the tent on the way to their
carriages.
<P>
"You r good name will be restored to you," he said, "on the day
when I make you my wife. The worst enemy you have cannot
associate _my_ name with a suspicion of theft. Remember that and
think a little before you decide. You see those people there. If
you don't change your mind by the time they have got to the
cottage, it's good-by between us, and good-by forever. I refuse
to wait for you; I refuse to accept a conditional engagement.
Wait, and think. They're walking slowly; you have got some
minutes more."
<P>
He still held her arm, watching the guests as they gradually
receded from view. It was not until they had all collected in a
group outside the cottage door that he spoke himself, or that he
permitted Isabel to speak again.
<P>
"Now," he said, "you have had your time to get cool. Will you
take my arm, and join those people with me? or will you say
good-by forever?"
<P>
"Forgive me, Alfred!" she began, gently. "I cannot consent, in
justice to you, to shelter myself behind your name. It is the
name of your family; and they have a right to expect that you
will not degrade it--"
<P>
"I want a plain answer," he interposed sternly. "Which is it?
Yes, or No?"
<P>
She looked at him with sad compassionate eyes. Her voice was firm
as she answered him in one word as he had desired. The word was--
"No."
<P>
Without speaking to her, without even looking at her, he turned
and walked back to the cottage.
<P>
Making his way silently through the group of visitors--every one
of whom had been informed of what had happened by his
sister--with his head down and his lips fast closed, he entered
the parlor and rang the bell which communicated with his
foreman's rooms at the stables.
<P>
"You know that I am going abroad on business?" he said, when the
man appeared.
<P>
"Yes, sir."
<P>
"I am going to-day--going by the night train to Dover. Order the
horse to be put to instantly in the dogcart. Is there anything
wanted before I am off?"
<P>
The inexorable necessities of business asserted their claims
through the obedient medium of the foreman. Chafing at the delay,
Hardyman was obliged to sit at his desk, signing checks and
passing accounts, with the dogcart waiting in the stable yard.
<P>
A knock at the door startled him in the middle of his work. "Come
in," he called out sharply.
<P>
He looked up, expecting to see one of the guests or one of the
servants. It was Moody who entered the room. Hardyman laid down
his pen, and fixed his eyes sternly on the man who had dared to
interrupt him.
<P>
"What the devil do _you_ want?" he asked.
<P>
"I have seen Miss Isabel, and spoken with her," Moody replied.
"Mr. Hardyman, I believe it is in your power to set this matter
right. For the young lady's sake, sir, you must not leave England
without doing it."
<P>
Hardyman turned to his foreman. "Is this fellow mad or drunk?" he
asked.
<P>
Moody proceeded as calmly and as resolutely as if those words had
not been spoken. "I apologize for my intrusion, sir. I will
trouble you with no explanations. I will only ask one question.
Have you a memorandum of the number of that five-hundred pound
note you paid away in France?"
<P>
Hardyman lost all control over himself.
<P>
"You scoundrel!" he cried, "have you been prying into my private
affairs? Is it _your_ business to know what I did in France?"
<P>
"Is it _your_ vengeance on a woman to refuse to tell her the
number of a bank-note?" Moody rejoined, firmly.
<P>
That answer forced its way, through Hardyman's anger, to
Hardyman's sense of honor. He rose and advanced to Moody. For a
moment the two men faced each other in silence. "You're a bold
fellow," said Hardyman, with a sudden change from anger to irony.
"I'll do the lady justice. I'll look at my pocketbook."
<P>
He put his hand into the breast-pocket of his coat; he searched
his other pockets; he turned over the objects on his
writing-table. The book was gone.
<P>
Moody watched him with a feeling of despair. "Oh! Mr. Hardyman,
don't say you have lost your pocketbook!"
<P>
He sat down again at his desk, with sullen submission to the new
disaster. "All I can say is you're at liberty to look for it," he
replied. "I must have dropped it somewhere." He turned
impatiently to the foreman, "Now then! What is the next check
wanted? I shall go mad if I wait in this damned place much
longer!"
<P>
Moody left him, and found his way to the servants' offices. "Mr.
Hardyman has lost his pocketbook," he said. "Look for it, indoors
and out--on the lawn, and in the tent. Ten pounds reward for the
man who finds it!"
<P>
Servants and waiters instantly dispersed, eager for the promised
reward. The men who pursued the search outside the cottage
divided their forces. Some of them examined the lawn and the
flower-beds. Others went straight to the empty tent. These last
were too completely absorbed in pursuing the object in view to
notice that they disturbed a dog, eating a stolen lunch of his
own from the morsels left on the plates. The dog slunk away under
the canvas when the men came in, waited in hiding until they had
gone, then returned to the tent, and went on with his luncheon.
<P>
Moody hastened back to the part of the grounds (close to the
shrubbery) in which Isabel was waiting his return.
<P>
She looked at him, while he was telling her of his interview with
Hardyman, with an expression in her eyes which he had never seen
in them before--an expression which set his heart beating wildly,
and made him break off in his narrative before he had reached the
end.
<P>
"I understand," she said quietly, as he stopped in confusion.
"You have made one more sacrifice to my welfare. Robert! I
believe you are the noblest man that ever breathed the breath of
life!"
<P>
His eyes sank before hers; he blushed like a boy. "I have done
nothing for you yet," he said. "Don't despair of the future, if
the pocketbook should not be found. I know who the man is who
received the bank note; and I have only to find him to decide the
question whether it _is_ the stolen note or not."
<P>
She smiled sadly as his enthusiasm. "Are you going back to Mr.
Sharon to help you?" she asked. "That trick he played me has
destroyed _my_ belief in him. He no more knows than I do who the
thief really is."
<P>
"You are mistaken, Isabel. He knows--and I know." He stopped
there, and made a sign to her to be silent. One of the servants
was approaching them.
<P>
"Is the pocketbook found?" Moody asked.
<P>
"No, sir."
<P>
"Has Mr. Hardyman left the cottage?"
<P>
"He has just gone, sir. Have you any further instructions to give
us?"
<P>
"No. There is my address in London, if the pocketbook should be
found."
<P>
The man took the card that was handed to him and retired. Moody
offered his arm to Isabel. "I am at your service," he said, "when
you wish to return to your aunt."
<P>
They had advanced nearly as far as the tent, on their way out of
the grounds, when they were met by a gentleman walking towards
them from the cottage. He was a stranger to Isabel. Moody
immediately recognized him as Mr. Felix Sweetsir.
<P>
"Ha! our good Moody!" cried Felix. "Enviable man! you look
younger than ever." He took off his hat to Isabel; his bright
restless eyes suddenly became quiet as they rested on her. "Have
I the honor of addressing the future Mrs. Hardyman? May I offer
my best congratulations? What has become of our friend Alfred?"
<P>
Moody answered for Isabel. "If you will make inquiries at the
cottage, sir," he said, "you will find that you are mistaken, to
say the least of it, in addressing your questions to this young
lady."
<P>
Felix took off his hat again--with the most becoming appearance
of surprise and distress.
<P>
"Something wrong, I fear?" he said, addressing Isabel. "I am,
indeed, ashamed if I have ignorantly given you a moment's pain.
Pray accept my most sincere apologies. I have only this instant
arrived; my health would not allow me to be present at the
luncheon. Permit me to express the earnest hope that matters may
be set right to the satisfaction of all parties. Good-afternoon!"
<P>
He bowed with elaborate courtesy, and turned back to the cottage.
<P>
"Who is that?" Isabel asked.
<P>
"Lady Lydiard's nephew, Mr. Felix Sweetsir," Moody answered, with
a sudden sternness of tone, and a sudden coldness of manner,
which surprised Isabel.
<P>
"You don't like him?" she said.
<P>
As she spoke, Fe lix stopped to give audience to one of the
grooms, who had apparently been sent with a message to him. He
turned so that his face was once more visible to Isabel. Moody
pressed her hand significantly as it rested on his arm.
<P>
"Look well at that man," he whispered. "It's time to warn you.
Mr. Felix Sweetsir is the worst enemy you have!"
<P>
Isabel heard him in speechless astonishment. He went on in tones
that trembled with suppressed emotion.
<P>
"You doubt if Sharon knows the thief. You doubt if I know the
thief. Isabel! as certainly as the heaven is above us, there
stands the wretch who stole the bank-note!"
<P>
She drew her hand out of his arm with a cry of terror. She looked
at him as if she doubted whether he was in his right mind.
<P>
He took her hand, and waited a moment trying to compose himself.
<P>
"Listen to me," he said. "At the first consultation I had with
Sharon he gave this advice to Mr. Troy and to me. He said,
'Suspect the very last person on whom suspicion could possibly
fall.' Those words, taken with the questions he had asked before
he pronounced his opinion, struck through me as if he had struck
me with a knife. I instantly suspected Lady Lydiard's nephew.
Wait! From that time to this I have said nothing of my suspicion
to any living soul. I knew in my own heart that it took its rise
in the inveterate dislike that I have always felt for Mr.
Sweetsir, and I distrusted it accordingly. But I went back to
Sharon, for all that, and put the case into his hands. His
investigations informed me that Mr. Sweetsir owed 'debts of
honor' (as gentlemen call them), incurred through lost bets, to a
large number of persons, and among them a bet of five hundred
pounds lost to Mr. Hardyman. Further inquiries showed that Mr.
Hardyman had taken the lead in declaring that he would post Mr.
Sweetsir as a defaulter, and have him turned out of his clubs,
and turned out of the betting-ring. Ruin stared him in the face
if he failed to pay his debt to Mr. Hardyman on the last day left
to him--the day after the note was lost. On that very morning,
Lady Lydiard, speaking to me of her nephew's visit to her, said,
'If I had given him an opportunity of speaking, Felix would have
borrowed money of me; I saw it in his face.' One moment more,
Isabel. I am not only certain that Mr. Sweetsir took the
five-hundred pound note out of the open letter, I am firmly
persuaded that he is the man who told Lord Rotherfield of the
circumstances under which you left Lady Lydiard's house. Your
marriage to Mr. Hardyman might have put you in a position to
detect the theft. You, not I, might, in that case, have
discovered from your husband that the stolen note was the note
with which Mr. Sweetsir paid his debt. He came here, you may
depend on it, to make sure that he had succeeded in destroying
your prospects. A more depraved villain at heart than that man
never swung from a gallows!"
<P>
He checked himself at those words. The shock of the disclosure,
the passion and vehemence with which he spoke, overwhelmed
Isabel. She trembled like a frightened child.
<P>
While he was still trying to soothe and reassure her, a low
whining made itself heard at her feet. They looked down, and saw
Tommie. Finding himself noticed at last, he expressed his sense
of relief by a bark. Something dropped out of his mouth. As Moody
stooped to pick it up, the dog ran to Isabel and pushed his head
against her feet, as his way was when he expected to have the
handkerchief thrown over him, preparatory to one of those games
at hide-and-seek which have been already mentioned. Isabel put
out her hand to caress him, when she was stopped by a cry from
Moody. It was _his_ turn to tremble now. His voice faltered as he
said the words, "The dog has found the pocketbook!"
<P>
He opened the book with shaking hands. A betting-book was bound
up in it, with the customary calendar. He turned to the date of
the day after the robbery.
<P>
There was the entry: "Felix Sweetsir. Paid 500 pounds. Note
numbered, N 8, 70564; dated 15th May, 1875."
<P>
Moody took from his waistcoat pocket his own memorandum of the
number of the lost bank-note. "Read it Isabel," he said. "I won't
trust my memory."
<P>
She read it. The number and date of the note entered in the
pocketbook exactly corresponded with the number and date of the
note that Lady Lydiard had placed in her letter.
<P>
Moody handed the pocketbook to Isabel. "There is the proof of
your innocence," he said, "thanks to the dog! Will you write and
tell Mr. Hardyman what has happened?" he asked, with his head
down and his eyes on the ground.
<P>
She answered him, with the bright color suddenly flowing over her
face.
<P>
"_You_ shall write to him," she said, "when the time comes."
<P>
"What time?" he asked.
<P>
She threw her arms round his neck, and hid her face on his bosom.
<P>
"The time," she whispered, "when I am your wife."
<P>
A low growl from Tommie reminded them that he too had some claim
to be noticed.
<P>
Isabel dropped on her knees, and saluted her old playfellow with
the heartiest kisses she had ever given him since the day when
their acquaintance began. "You darling!" she said, as she put him
down again, "what can I do to reward you?"
<P>
Tommie rolled over on his back--more slowly than usual, in
consequence of his luncheon in the tent. He elevated his four
paws in the air and looked lazily at Isabel out of his bright
brown eyes. If ever a dog's look spoke yet, Tommie's look said,
"I have eaten too much; rub my stomach."
<P>
<P>
POSTSCRIPT.
<P>
Persons of a speculative turn of mind are informed that the
following document is for sale, and are requested to mention what
sum they will give for it.
<P>
"IOU, Lady Lydiard, five hundred pounds (L500), Felix Sweetsir."
<P>
Her Ladyship became possessed of this pecuniary remittance under
circumstances which surround it with a halo of romantic interest.
It was the last communication she was destined to receive from
her accomplished nephew. There was a Note attached to it, which
cannot fail to enhance its value in the estimation of all
right-minded persons who assist the circulation of paper money.
<P>
The lines that follow are strictly confidential:
<P>
"Note.--Our excellent Moody informs me, my dear aunt, that you
have decided (against his advice) on 'refusing to prosecute.' I
have not the slightest idea of what he means; but I am very much
obliged to him, nevertheless, for reminding me of a circumstance
which is of some interest to yourself personally.
<P>
"I am on the point of retiring to the Continent in search of
health. One generally forgets something important when one starts
on a journey. Before Moody called, I had entirely forgotten to
mention that I had the pleasure of borrowing five hundred pounds
of you some little time since.
<P>
"On the occasion to which I refer, your language and manner
suggested that you would not lend me the money if I asked for it.
Obviously, the only course left was to take it without asking. I
took it while Moody was gone to get some curacoa; and I returned
to the picture-gallery in time to receive that delicious liqueur
from the footman's hands.
<P>
"You will naturally ask why I found it necessary to supply myself
(if I may borrow an expression from the language of State
finance) with this 'forced loan.' I was actuated by motives which
I think do me honor. My position at the time was critical in the
extreme. My credit with the money-lenders was at an end; my
friends had all turned their backs on me. I must either take the
money or disgrace my family. If there is a man living who is
sincerely attached to his family, I am that man. I took the
money.
<P>
"Conceive your position as my aunt (I say nothing of myself), if
I had adopted the other alternative. Turned out of the Jockey
Club, turned out of Tattersalls', turned out of the betting-ring;
in short, posted publicly as a defaulter before the noblest
institution in England, the Turf--and all for want of five
hundred pounds to stop the mouth of the greatest brute I know of,
Alfred Hardyman! Let me not harrow your feelings (and mine) by
dwelling on it. Dear and admirable woman! To you belongs the
honor of saving the credit of the family; I can claim nothing but
the inferior merit of having offered you the opportunity.
<P>
"My IOU, it is needless to say, accompanies these lines. Can I do
anything for you abroad?-- F. S."
<P>
<P>
To this it is only necessary to add (first) that Moody was
perfectly right in believing F. S. to be the person who informed
Hardyman's father of Isabel's position when she left Lady
Lydiard's house; and (secondly) that Felix did really forward Mr.
Troy's narrative of the theft to the French police, altering
nothing in it but the number of the lost bank-note.
<P>
<P>
What is there left to write about? Nothing is left--but to say
good-by (very sorrowfully on the writer's part) to the Persons of
the Story.
<P>
Good-by to Miss Pink--who will regret to her dying day that
Isabel's answer to Hardyman was No.
<P>
Good-by to Lady Lydiard--who differs with Miss Pink, and would
have regretted it, to _her_ dying day, if the answer had been
Yes.
<P>
Good-by to Moody and Isabel--whose history has closed with the
closing of the clergyman's book on their wedding-day.
<P>
Good-by to Hardyman--who has sold his farm and his horses, and
has begun a new life among the famous fast trotters of America.
<P>
Good-by to Old Sharon--who, a martyr to his promise, brushed his
hair and washed his face in honor of Moody's marriage; and
catching a severe cold as the necessary consequence, declared, in
the intervals of sneezing, that he would "never do it again."
<P>
And last, not least, good-by to Tommie? No. The writer gave
Tommie his dinner not half an hour since, and is too fond of him
to say good-by.
<P>
<P>
