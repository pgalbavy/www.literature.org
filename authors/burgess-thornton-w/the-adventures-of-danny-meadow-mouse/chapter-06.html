<p>"<em>THERE </em>he goes!" cried old Granny Fox. "Don’t let him
sit still again!"</p>

<p>"I hear him!" shouted Reddy Fox, and plunged down into the snow
just as Granny Fox had done a minute before. But he didn’t catch
anything, and when he had blown the snow out of his nose and wiped
it out of his eyes, he saw Granny Fox dive into the snow with
no better luck.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Granny Fox, "as long as we keep him running,
we can hear him, and some one of these times we’ll catch him.
Pretty soon he’ll get too tired to be so spry, and when he is—"
Granny didn’t finish, but licked her chops and smacked her lips.
Reddy Fox grinned, then licked his chops and smacked his lips.
Then once more they took turns diving into the snow.</p>

<p>And down underneath in the little tunnels he had made, Danny
Meadow Mouse was running for his life. He was getting tired, just
as old Granny Fox had said he would. He was almost out of breath.
He was sore and one leg smarted, for in one of her jumps old Granny
Fox had so nearly caught him that her claws had torn his pants
and scratched him.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! If only I had time to think!" panted Danny
Meadow Mouse, and then he squealed in still greater fright as
Reddy Fox crashed down into his tunnel right at his very heels.
"I’ve got to get somewhere! I’ve got to get somewhere where they
can’t get at me!" he sobbed. And right that very instant he remembered
the old fence-post!</p>

<p>The old fence-post lay on the ground and was hollow. Fastened
to it were long wires with sharp cruel barbs. Danny had made a
tunnel over to that old fence-post the very first day after the
snow came, for in that hollow in the old post he had a secret
store of seeds. Why hadn’t he thought of it before? It must have
been because he was too frightened to think. But he remembered
now, and he dodged into the tunnel that led to the old fence-post,
running faster than ever, for though his heart was in his mouth
from fear, in his heart was hope, and hope is a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>Now old Granny Fox knew all about that old fence-post and she
remembered all about those barbed wires fastened to it. Although
they were covered with snow she knew just about where they lay,
and just before she reached them she stopped plunging down into
the snow. Reddy Fox knew about those wires, too, but he was so
excited that he forgot all about them.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried old Granny Fox sharply.</p>

<p>But Reddy Fox didn’t hear, or if he heard he didn’t heed. His
sharp ears could hear Danny Meadow Mouse running almost underneath
him. Granny Fox could stop if she wanted to, but he was going
to have Danny Meadow Mouse for his breakfast! Down into the snow
he plunged as hard as ever he could.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Wow! Wow! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>That wasn’t the voice of Danny Meadow Mouse. Oh, my, no! It was
the voice of Reddy Fox. Yes, Sir, it was the voice of Reddy Fox.
He had landed with one of his black paws right on one of those
sharp wire barbs, and it did hurt dreadfully.</p>

<p>"I never did know a young Fox who could get into so much trouble
as you can!" snapped old Granny Fox, as Reddy hobbled along on
three legs behind her, across the snow-covered Green Meadows.
"It serves you right for forgetting!"</p>

<p>"Yes’m," said Reddy meekly.</p>

<p>And safe in the hollow of the old fence-post, Danny Meadow Mouse
was dressing the scratch on his leg made by the claws of old Granny
Fox.</p>
