<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>One afternoon in early spring, Jack Carleton, a sturdy youth
of seventeen years, was following a clearly-marked trail, leading
through the western part of Kentucky toward the Mississippi river.
For many a mile he followed the evenly spaced tracks made by a
horse on a walk, the double impressions being a trifle more than
three feet apart.</p>

<p>"Helloa!" exclaimed, Jack, when he looked at the earth again
and observed that the tracks had taken a new form, with nearly
eight feet between them.  "Otto has forced the colt to a trot. 
He must be in a hurry, or he thinks I am fond of traveling."</p>

<p>Thus far the lusty young Kentuckian felt no misgiving, but within
fifty yards the trail underwent the startling change&mdash;the footprints
being separated by more than three yards now.</p>

<p>"My gracious," muttered the boy, coming to a full stop, "something
is wrong: Otto would not have put the horse on a dead run if he
hadn't been scared."</p>

<p>Jack Carleton proved his training by the keenness and quickness
with which he surveyed his surroundings.  The woods were on every
hand, but they were open and free from undergrowth, so that he
gained an extensive view.</p>

<p>As he advanced with vigorous steps along the winding path, his
eyes sometimes rested on the pendulous branches of the majestic
elm, a small purple flower here and there still clinging to the
limbs and resisting the budding leaves striving to force it aside;
the massive oak and its twisted, iron limbs; the pinnated leaves
of the hickory, whose solid trunk, when gashed by the axe, was
of snowy whiteness; the pale green spikes and tiny flowers of
the chestnut; the sycamore, whose spreading limbs found themselves
crowded even in the most open spaces, with an occasional wild
cherry or tulip, and now and then a pine, whose resinous breath
brooded like a perennial balm over the vast solitude.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton was arrayed in the coarse, serviceable garb of
the border: heavy calf-skin shoes, thick trousers, leggings and
coat, the latter short and clasped at the waist by a girdle, also
of woolen and similar to that of the modern ulster.  The cap was
of the same material and, like the other garments, had been fashioned
and put together by the deft hands of the mother in Kentucky.
Powder-horn and bullet-pouch were suspended by strings passing
over alternate sides of the neck and a fine flint-lock rifle,
the inseparable companion of the Western youth, rested on the
right shoulder, the hand grasping it near the stock.</p>

<p>Jack's hasty survey failed to reveal any cause for fear, and
he resumed his pursuit, as it may be termed.  The quick glances
he cast on the ground in front showed, in every instance, that
the horse he was following was fleeing at the same headlong pace. 
His rider had spurred him to a dead run, at which gait he had
shot underneath the limbs of the trees at great risk to himself
as well as to his rider.</p>

<p>The trail was broad, for loaded horses had passed in both directions,
and wild animals availed themselves of it more than once in making
their pilgrimages to the Mississippi, or in migrating from one
part of the country to the other.</p>

<p>But there were no footprints that had been made within the past
few days, with the single exception noted&mdash;that of the horse which
had abruptly broken into a full run.</p>

<p>The balmy afternoon was drawing to a close, and Jack began to
believe the chances were against overtaking his friend and companion,
young Otto Relstaub.</p>

<p>"If he has kept this up very long, he must be far beyond my reach,
unless he has turned about and taken the back trail."</p>

<p>Glancing at the sky as seen through the branches overhead, the
youth observed that it was clear, the deep blue flecked here and
there by patches of snowy clouds, resting motionless in the crystalline
air.</p>

<p>Comparatively young as was Jack, he had been thoroughly trained
in woodcraft.  When beyond sight of the cabins of the straggling
settlement, where he made his home, he was as watchful and alert
as Daniel Boone or Simon Kenton himself.  His penetrating gray
eyes not only scanned the sinuous path, stretching in front, but
darted from side to side, and were frequently turned behind him. 
He knew that if danger threatened it was as likely to come from
one point as another.</p>

<p>He could not avoid one conclusion: the peril which had impelled
the young German's horse to such a burst of speed must have been
in the form dreaded above all others&mdash;that of the wild Indians
who at that day roamed through the vast wilderness of the West
and hovered along the frontier, eager to use the torch, the rifle,
or the tomahawk, whenever and wherever the way opened.</p>

<p>The probability that such was the cause of the horseman's haste
threw the young Kentuckian at once on his mettle.  Inasmuch as
he was putting forth every effort to rejoin his companion, there
was good reason for fearing a collision with the red men.  He
had been in several desperate affrays with them, and, like a sensible
person, he spared no exertion to escape all such encounters.</p>

<p>"If they will let me alone I will not disturb them," was the
principle which not only he, but many of the bravest frontiersmen
followed daring the eventful early days of the West.</p>

<p>The youth now dropped into the loping trot of the American Indian&mdash;a
gait which, as in the case of the dusky warrior himself, he was
able to maintain hour after hour, without fatigue.  The sharp
glances thrown in every direction were not long in making a discovery,
though not of the nature anticipated.</p>

<p>A short distance in front a white oak, whose trunk was fully
two feet in diameter, grew beside the trail which he was following. 
Its shaggy limbs twisted their way across the path and among the
branches on the other side.  The exuberant leaves offered such
inviting concealment to man and animal that the youth subjected
them to the keenest scrutiny.</p>

<p>His trot dropped to a slow walk, and he instinctively glanced
at the lock of his gun to make sure it was ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>Something was moving among the branches of the forest monarch,
but Jack knew it was not an Indian.  No warrior would climb into
a tree to wait for his prey, when, he could secure better concealment
on the ground, where he would not be compelled to yield the use
of his legs, which play such an important part in the maneuverings
of the red man.</p>

<p>The lad caught several glimpses of the strange animal, and, when
within a few rods, identified it.</p>

<p>"It's a painter," he said to himself, with a faint smile, resuming
his slow advance and giving a sigh of relief; "I don't know whether
it is worth while to give him a shot or not."</p>

<p>The name "painter," so common among American hunters, is a corruption
of "panther," which is itself an incorrect application, the genuine
panther being found only in Africa and India.  In South America
the corresponding animal is the jaguar, and in North America the
cougar or catamount, and sometimes the American lion.</p>

<p>Jack Carlton did not hold the brute in special fear, though he
knew that when wounded or impelled by hunger he was a dangerous
foe. During an unusually cold day, only a few months before, one
of them had made an open attack on him, inflicting some severe
scratches and tearing most of his clothes to shreds.</p>

<p>It would have been one of the easiest things in the world for
the young Kentuckian to settle the whole question by leaving the
trail and making a detour that would take him safely by the treacherous
beast, which, as a rule, is afraid to assault a person.  The lad
was certain that at that season of the year it would not leave
the tree to attack him.</p>

<p>But if he took such a course, it would be a confession of timidity
on his part against which, his nature and training rebelled.</p>

<p>"No," Said he, after brief hesitation, "I won't leave the path
for all the painters this side of the Mississippi.  It may not
be wise for me to fire my gun just now and I won't do it, if he
behaves himself, but I don't mean to put up with any nonsense."</p>

<p>He brought his weapon in front, raised the hammer and closely
watched the animal above, while the quadruped was equally intent
in observing him.  It was a curious sight&mdash;the two scrutinizing
each other with such defiant distrust.</p>

<p>The cougar was crouching on a broad limb, just far enough from
the trunk of the oak to be directly over the trail.  He was extended
full length, and, as partly seen through the leaves, offered the
best target possible for the marksman below.</p>

<p>But Jack preferred not to fire his gun, for the reason that the
report was likely to be heard by more dangerous enemies.  His
purpose was to refrain from doing so, unless forced to shoot in
self defense, and his pride would not permit him to deviate a
hair's-breadth from the path in order to escape the necessity
of shooting.</p>

<p>He walked with the deliberate, noiseless tread of an Indian,
looking steadily upward at the eyes which assumed a curious, phosphorescent
glare, that scintillated with a greenish light, as the relative
position of the enemies changed.</p>

<p>The lad passed under the limbs staring unflinchingly aloft. 
When exactly beneath, the cougar was hidden for an instant from
sight, but, recognizing the changing conditions, he quickly lifted
his head to the right, and the lad again saw the greenish glare,
the white teeth, and blood red mouth.  He traced the outlines
of the sinewy body close along the limb, and through which he
could have driven a bullet with fatal certainty.  The "painter,"
whose scream is often mistaken for the cry of a human being, uttered
an occasional snarling growl as he looked down on the lad.  His
attitude and manner seemed to say: "I've got my eye on you, young
man!  Walk very straight or you will find yourself in trouble."</p>

<p>The probability that a cougar is gathering his muscles on a limb
with the intention of bounding down on one's shoulders, is enough
to make the bravest man uneasy.  Jack Carleton did feel a creeping
chill, but the same pride which prevented him deviating a hair's-breadth
from the trail, would not allow him to increase or retard his
gait.</p>

<p>"If you think you can make me run, old fellow," he muttered,
with his gaze still fixed on the beast, "you are mistaken.  We
don't meet wild animals in Kentucky that are able to drive us
out of the woods. You needn't fancy, either, that I am in any
hurry to walk away from you."</p>

<p>And, to show the contempt in which he held the beast, the youth
at that moment came to a full stop, turned about and faced him.</p>
