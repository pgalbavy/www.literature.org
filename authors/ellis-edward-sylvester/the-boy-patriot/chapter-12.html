<p>"I've broken my jack-knife," said the yellow-headed, yellow-faced
tar who rejoiced in the nickname of Brimstone. The speech was
accompanied by an oath that chilled the very soul of Blair Robertson;
but it was the morning after the watch which had so changed his
views towards his wild associates, and he at once seized the opportunity
to begin his new line of conduct.</p>

<p>Blair had a large many-bladed Sheffield knife, which had been
a present to his father from an English captain. For several years
it was hoarded as a special treasure, and then on a Christmas-day
found its way into the pocket of the only son. Blair knew the
worth and temper of every blade, and its fit and appointed use.
Not a boy in Fairport had such a knife, as had been acknowledged
on all hands. He had besides often thought of it as no bad weapon
in case of an attack from any of the fighting crew of the Molly.
"To stick a man," was in their estimation no uncommon occurrence,
judging from the tales of their adventures, which they delighted
to tell.</p>

<p>"Take my knife, wont you? It is a first-rate one," said Blair,
handing over his treasure as freely as if the sacrifice had cost
him no effort.</p>

<p>Brimstone opened his round cat-like eyes in surprise; and then
dropping the knife into the depths of his pocket, said, "Green,
green! You expected to make a trade with me, I suppose. You can't
come it. I never swap."</p>

<p>"I meant to make you a present of it. You seemed so put out about
your knife's breaking," said Blair pleasantly. "A fellow does
hate to break his knife. An English captain gave that to my father
five years ago. It has six blades."</p>

<p>Brimstone took the knife out of his pocket and examined it slowly,
opening blade after blade with the air of a connoisseur.</p>

<p>"I say, youngster, it's a first-rate article. You meant a swap,
now; own up. What did you mean to ask me for it, if I'd been in
the humor?"</p>

<p>"There is only one thing I should like to ask of you," began
Blair.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! I knew you meant a swap," said Brimstone. "There's no
harm in making a clean breast of it."</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you not to swear those horrible oaths. I tremble
lest God, whose great name you blaspheme, should smite you dead
with those curses on your lips," said Blair earnestly.</p>

<p>Brimstone had the long blade of the knife open. He gave an angry
thrust at Blair, which the lad skilfully avoided, but without
a shadow of fear in his fine face. "None of that talk," exclaimed
Brimstone. "We say <em>what</em> we please and <em>when</em> we
please on board the Molly. Mum's the right word for you. We want
no parson just out of petticoats here."</p>

<p>Blair walked quietly away. His precious knife was gone, and he
had perhaps but irritated and made more unfriendly one of the
very men whom he so longed to influence for good. He had left
himself without any defensive weapon among men who reckoned human
life as of trifling value. Yet Blair was not discouraged. He had
made a beginning; and though roughly received, it was an effort
put forth in a Christian spirit, and could not be lost. With a
petition in his heart for the rough sailor he had just quitted,
Blair went to a quiet part of the ship to write a few lines to
his mother. It seemed to him it would be a comfort to fancy himself
in communication with her, though the letter might never fall
under her dear eyes. Yet that was not impossible. There were letters
waiting already on board, until they could be sent by some homeward-bound
craft. The little mail-bag might find a timely and trusty bearer.</p>

<p>Blair had nearly filled the sheet before him, unconscious of
any observers. The vessel lay becalmed, scarcely moving on the
quiet waters, and the men had been stretched lazily about, or
leisurely mending sails, or washing their clothing in true sailors'
fashion. Drawn on by Brimstone's beckoning finger, a group had
silently gathered round Blair, ready for any wild frolic at the
boy's expense which their summoner might have in his unscrupulous
brain.</p>

<p>Just as Blair put the signature to his letter, the paper was
snatched from his hand by some one from behind.</p>

<p>"Now hear, worshipful shipmates," said Brimstone, making as if
he would read the letter aloud.</p>

<p>"You don't know your alphabet," said Derry Duck contemptuously.
"I am the scholard for you; but I choose to let the writer do
his own reading. Here, Mum, let us have the benefit of your long-tailed
letter in plain English, stops put in all right."</p>

<p>Blair's eyes flashed for a moment, but the next he put out his
hand for the letter, and said pleasantly, "Do you really want
to know how a Yankee boy writes home to his mother? Well, then,
I'll read every word out, just as it is written."</p>

<p>[Illustration:]</p>

<p>The tones of Blair's voice were clear and firm as he read as
follows:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>DEAR MOTHER<br/>
&</em>mdash;I always thought I loved you, but I never half knew<br/>
what you were to me before. I think of you by day, and dream of you<br/>
by night."

</p>
</div>
<p>"I should think he was writing to his sweetheart," said Brimstone
with a coarse laugh.</p>

<p>"Silence," shouted Derry Duck in a tone of command. "Go on, boy."</p>

<p>Blair resumed. "I am on board the 'Molly,' Captain Knox, an American
privateer, safe and sound, in full health and fair spirits, thanks
to the good God who has watched over me. It would be a long story
to tell you how I came here; that I will reserve till we meet.
When the British commander found he could not <em>make</em> me
pilot him into Fairport, he put for the open sea, and there we
took the gale. A real tear-away it was, and raked the old ship
well-nigh clean from stem to stern; but they rigged her up again,
and had her skimming the seas like a duck before two days were
over. I had to leave Hal Hutchings on board of her; they claimed
him for an English subject. It was like losing my eyes to part
with him.</p>

<p>"I never thought to see such danger as has fallen to my lot since
I kissed you good-by, dear mother; but my heart has never failed
me. God has sustained me in every hour of trial, and I trust him
for all that is before me, be it danger or temptation or death.
He is all-powerful. In his strength I shall come off conqueror.
He spread this smiling sky above me. He measured these limitless
waters in the hollow of his hand. He can, he will, keep me from
all evil; and if death shall be my portion, he will take me, all
unworthy as I am, to his kingdom of glory, for the sake of our
crucified Redeemer."</p>

<p>Blair Robertson had the rare gifts of voice and manner which
ever exercise an influence more powerful than force of argument
or elegance of style. What he said went home to the hearts of
his hearers. As he uttered the deep feelings of his soul, his
rude listeners were awed into silence. He paused, and there was
a moment of deathlike stillness.</p>

<p>It was interrupted by Brimstone, who uttered an oath in coarse
bravado, as he exclaimed that he for one would hear no more such
stuff, fit only for milk-sop landlubbers and silly women.</p>

<p>"Read no more, my boy," said Deny Duck soberly. "You cast your
pearls before swine."</p>

<p>Blair turned a quick look upon the mate as he said, "You then
know something of Scripture, and can make a right use of it. I
believe I have found a friend."</p>

<p>"You have, you have," said Derry Duck, grasping the offered hand
of the stripling in a gripe that would have made him wince with
pain but for the bounding joy of his heart.</p>

<p>Derry Duck was called away at that moment by a summons from the
captain, and Blair, unmolested, closed his letter and dropped
it in the mail-bag. Prayer for the mate of the Molly was in the
heart of Blair, even as his hands were busy with the melting wax,
or loosing the rude entrance to the post-office on the sea.</p>
