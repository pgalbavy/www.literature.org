I must now tell you what had become of Button-Bright
since he wandered away in the morning and got lost. This
small boy, as perhaps you have discovered, was almost as
destitute of nerves as the Scarecrow. Nothing ever
astonished him much; nothing ever worried him or made him
unhappy. Good fortune or bad fortune he accepted with a
quiet smile, never complaining, whatever happened. This
was one reason why Button-Bright was a favorite with all
who knew him -- and perhaps it was the reason why he so
often got into difficulties, or found himself lost.
<P>
To-day, as he wandered here and there, over hill and
down dale, he missed Trot and Cap'n Bill, of whom he was
fond, but nevertheless he was not unhappy. The birds sang
merrily and the wildflowers were beautiful and the breeze
had a fragrance of new-mown hay
<P>
"The only bad thing about this country is its King," he
reflected; "but the country isn't to blame for that."
<P>
A prairie-dog stuck its round head out of a mound of
earth and looked at the boy with bright eyes.
<P>
"Walk around my house, please," it said, "and then you
won't harm it or disturb the babies."
<P>
"All right," answered Button-Bright, and took care not
to step on the mound. He went on, whistling merrily,
until a petulant voice cried:
<P>
"Oh, stop it! Please stop that noise. It gets on my
nerves."
<P>
Button-Bright saw an old gray owl sitting in the crotch
of a tree, and he replied with a laugh: "All right, old
Fussy," and stopped whistling until he had passed out of
the owl's hearing. At noon he came to a farmhouse where
an aged couple lived. They gave him a good dinner and
treated him kindly, but the man was deaf and the woman
was dumb, so they could answer no questions to guide him
on the way to Pon's house. When he left them he was just
as much lost as he had been before.
<P>
Every grove of trees he saw from a distance he visited,
for he remembered that the King's castle was near a grove
of trees and Pon's hut was near the King's castle; but
always he met with disappointment. Finally, passing
through one of these groves, he came out into the open
and found himself face to face with the Ork.
<P>
"Hello!" said Button-Bright. "Where did you come from?"
<P>
"From Orkland," was the reply. "I've found my own
country, at last, and it is not far from here, either. I
would have come back to you sooner, to see how you are
getting along, had not my family and friends welcomed my
return so royally that a great celebration was held in my
honor. So I couldn't very well leave Orkland again until
the excitement was over."
<P>
"Can you find your way back home again?" asked the boy.
<P>
"Yes, easily; for now I know exactly where it is. But
where are Trot and Cap'n Bill?"
<P>
Button-Bright related to the Ork their adventures since
it had left them in Jinxland, telling of Trot's fear that
the King had done something wicked to Cap'n Bill, and of
Pon's love for Gloria, and how Trot and Button-Bright had
been turned out of the King's castle. That was all the
news that the boy had, but it made the Ork anxious for
the safety of his friends.
<P>
"We must go to them at once, for they may need us," he
said.
<P>
"I don't know where to go," confessed Button-Bright.
"I'm lost."
<P>
"Well, I can take you back to the hut of the gardener's
boy," promised the Ork, "for when I fly high in the air I
can look down and easily spy the King's castle. That was
how I happened to spy you, just entering the grove; so I
flew down and waited until you came out."
<P>
"How can you carry me?" asked the boy.
<P>
"You'll have to sit straddle my shoulders and put your
arms around my neck. Do you think you can keep from
falling off?"
<P>
"I'll try," said Button-Bright. So the Ork squatted
down and the boy took his seat and held on tight. Then
the skinny creature's tail began whirling and up they
went, far above all the tree-tops.
<P>
After the Ork had circled around once or twice, its
sharp eyes located the towers of the castle and away it
flew, straight toward the place. As it hovered in the
air, near by the castle, Button-Bright pointed out Pon's
hut, so they landed just before it and Trot came running
out to greet them.
<P>
Gloria was introduced to the Ork, who was surprised
to find Cap'n Bill transformed into a grasshopper.
<P>
"How do you like it?" asked the creature.
<P>
"Why, it worries me good deal," answered Cap'n Bill,
perched upon Trot's shoulder. "I'm always afraid o' bein'
stepped on, and I don't like the flavor of grass an'
can't seem to get used to it. It's my nature to eat
grass, you know, but I begin to suspect it's an acquired
taste."
<P>
"Can you give molasses?" asked the Ork.
<P>
"I guess I'm not that kind of a grasshopper," replied
Cap'n Bill. "But I can't say what I might do if I was
squeezed -- which I hope I won't be."
<P>
"Well," said the Ork, "it's a great pity, and I'd like
to meet that cruel King and his Wicked Witch and punish
them both severely. You're awfully small, Cap'n Bill, but
I think I would recognize you anywhere by your wooden
leg."
<P>
Then the Ork and Button-Bright were told all about
Gloria's frozen heart and how the Scarecrow had come from
the Land of Oz to help them. The Ork seemed rather
disturbed when it learned that the Scarecrow had gone
alone to conquer King Krewl.
<P>
"I'm afraid he'll make a fizzle of it," said the skinny
creature, "and there's no telling what that terrible King
might do to the poor Scarecrow, who seems like a very
interesting person. So I believe I'll take a hand in this
conquest myself."
<P>
"How?" asked Trot.
<P>
"Wait and see," was the reply. "But, first of all, I
must fly home again -- back to my own country -- so if
you'll forgive my leaving you so soon, I'll be off at
once. Stand away from my tail, please, so that the wind
from it, when it revolves, won't knock you over."
<P>
They gave the creature plenty of room and away it went
like a flash and soon disappeared in the sky.
<P>
"I wonder," said Button-Bright, looking solemnly after
the Ork, "whether he'll ever come back again."
<P>
"Of course he will!" returned Trot. "The Ork's a pretty
good fellow, and we can depend on him. An' mark my words,
Button-Bright, whenever our Ork does come back, there's
one cruel King in Jinxland that'll wish he hadn't."
