<p>A few paces after the second turn brought the American to the
palace of President Yozarro,&mdash;a long, low, bamboo structure, standing
on slightly rising ground, where it could catch what little air
sometimes caressed the town at this time of day. The largest apartment
at the rear was the cabinet or council room of the Dictator and
President, since the open windows on that side were sure to receive
the cool breath of the mountains when it stole through the open
windows.</p>

<p>The American officer was fortunate in the time of his call. In
the long hall he met two men in uniform, well advanced in years
and stooping in an unmilitary way, whom he recognized as the leading
officers and counsellors of President Yozarro. It was manifest
that they had been holding a conference. The Major saluted them
as he passed down the hall to where a guard stood outside the
door, musket in hand.</p>

<p>"Will you say to his Excellency that Major Starland desires to
speak with him?" asked our friend in excellent Spanish. The Major
did not send in his card, for, truth to tell, he had none printed
in the language of the country, and he knew the other possessed
no knowledge of English.</p>

<p>The guard tapped on the door and disappeared for a minute. When
he came back, he held the door open and nodded to the visitor.
Major Starland, hat in hand, passed within with brisk, military
step, saluted and awaited the pleasure of the President of the
Atlamalcan Republic.</p>

<p>The latter was seated behind a large desk at the farther side
of the room, smoking a cigarette and facing the visitor. He was
of short stature and lacked the protuberant rotundity of President
Bambos. Like him his mustache was of glossy blackness and was
waxed to needle-like points, but the hair of General Yozarro was
cropped and there was a white sprinkling about the temples and
behind the ears. This, with the crows' feet and wrinkles, showed
that he was fully ten years the senior of his brother President.
He was in European dress, his coat, waistcoat and trousers being
of spotless white duck, his linen irreproachable, his feet inclosed
in patent leathers, and a diamond of eight or ten carats scintillated
in his snowy shirt front. He had been heard to boast that this
remarkable gem had been taken from the mountains of his own province.</p>

<p>The moment his glittering black eyes rested upon the trim figure
of the American he rose and gracefully waved him to a seat on
his right. Thanking him for his courtesy, Major Starland walked
briskly thither, sat down, crossed his legs, cleared his throat
and expressed his pleasure at seeing his distinguished friend
looking so well. President Yozarro returned the compliment in
the flowery language of his country, and asked the caller to do
him the great honor of telling him in what way he could serve
him. He assured him that it would be the joy of his heart, if
his humble aid would be accepted by one whom he held in such warm
friendship and lofty esteem.</p>

<p>While thus overwhelming his caller, President Yozarro snatched
up his cigarette box from his desk and held it out to the American,
who accepted the courtesy with thanks, lighted the wisp of fragrant
tobacco to which, as we know, he was unaccustomed, and sat back
at ease.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, I come from President Bambos."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to welcome you, and how is my esteemed brother?"</p>

<p>"Never better; when he told me of a slight misunderstanding,
I volunteered to lay the matter before you, knowing how willing
you would be to listen patiently, and aware too of your deep sense
of justice."</p>

<p>"You do me honor, my good friend," replied President Yozarro,
bowing and smiling so broadly that his white teeth gleamed through
his mustache. "I am eager as always to right any wrong and to
correct any misunderstanding."</p>

<p>"Three days ago when your excellent gunboat was at target practice,
on the Rio Rubio, one of the shots injured the dwelling of a citizen
of Zalapata."</p>

<p>"It grieves me to learn that," replied the President, as if the
episode was wholly new to him; "I am impatient to do what I can
to repair the carelessness of my gunner: will it please you to
have him shot, as a warning to others to be more careful?"</p>

<p>"By no means; the payment of the slight sum&mdash;only forty-two <em>pesos</em>&mdash;with
an expression of regret, will more than satisfy President Bambos."</p>

<p>"I shall hasten to comply with so moderate and just a demand:
will you be good enough to convey this statement to my esteemed
brother?"</p>

<p>Considering the moderate sum involved, it would seem that President
Yozarro might well have closed the incident by passing over the
amount to the ambassador, but, since he made no offer to do so,
the ambassador could not in common courtesy remind him of it.
The Atlamalcan Republic had its own methods and red tape ruled
there as elsewhere.</p>

<p>"I am sure that President Bambos could ask nothing more, and
I shall take pleasure in repeating your gracious words to him."</p>

<p>President Yozarro bowed, smiled, muttered "<em>Gracias</em>,"
and lit another cigarette.</p>

<p>"I beg your Excellency that I may have the privilege of a few
words with my sister, Miss Starland, who came ashore from my yacht
last week to visit her friend Señorita Estacardo, and whom it
has not been my pleasure to see since then."</p>

<p>"My good friend makes another request which it shall be my delight
to grant," replied President Yozarro, with his bland smile, as
he crossed his shapely legs, leaned back and blew the puffs of
his cigarette toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>Major Starland felt that he was getting on swimmingly. He had
already decided to hand over to President Bambos the amount of
the damages for the injury to the property of one of his citizens,
quite content to place it to his personal account of profit and
loss. Uneasy over the prolonged absence of Miss Starland, he would
quickly arrange matters with her during the impending interview.</p>

<p>"I have a pleasant surprise for you," said the President, after
his caller had expressed his acknowledgments; "the Señorita made
known so warm a wish to see her brother that I hastened to take
her, as she and I supposed, to him."</p>

<p>"I do not understand your Excellency."</p>

<p>"She is now at Zalapata, whither she went in our gunboat."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Last night; we must have met on the way, for you could scarcely
have made the voyage between the capitals since sunrise."</p>

<p>This remark explained that night trip of the <em>General Yozarro</em>,
whose going the Major had seen and whose returning he had heard.</p>

<p>"Yes," added his host; "she had but to make known her wish, when
she and her friend Señorita Manuela, my niece, became my guests
on my gunboat, and were landed at Zalapata last evening, where
she will be disappointed to find you absent, though your meeting
will be deferred but a short time."</p>

<p>With many acknowledgments, Major Starland bade President Yozarro
good bye, passed out into the hall and hurried down the street
to the wharf, where Captain Guzman was placidly awaiting him.
The same drowsiness that he had noted on his arrival, brooded
over everything, and no time was lost in casting off and heading
down the river.</p>

<p>But during the absence of the American, the Captain had had a
visitor, who did not step ashore, but helped in getting the boat
under way, and showed by his action, that he meant to remain with
them, if they did not object thereto.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Starland, at the first opportunity to speak
privately to his friend.</p>

<p>"Martella, a deserter from President Yozarro."</p>

<p>"That won't do, Captain; I cannot permit him to go with us."</p>

<p>"Not so, Major; he is more valuable than you think; he will tell
you something you ought to know."</p>
