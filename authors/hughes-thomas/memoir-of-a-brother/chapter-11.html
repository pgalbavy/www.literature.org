<p>On looking through the preceding pages, I have been struck with
one special shortcoming. I am painfully conscious how poor and
shallow the picture here attempted will be, in any case, to those
who knew my brother best. Nevertheless, those for whom it was
undertaken will, I trust, be able to get from it some clearer
idea of the outer life of their father and uncle, but of that
which underlies the outer life they will learn almost nothing.
And yet how utterly inadequate must be any knowledge of a human
being which does not get beneath this surface! How difficult to
do so to any good purpose! For that "inner," or "eternal," or
"religious" life (call it which you will, they all mean the same
thing) is so entirely a matter between each human soul and God,
is at best so feebly and imperfectly expressed by the outer life.
But, difficult as it may be, the attempt must be made; for I find
that I cannot finish my task with a good conscience without making
it.</p>

<p>There is not one of you, however young, but must be living two
lives—and the sooner you come to recognize the fact clearly, the
better for you—the one life in the outward material world, in
contact with the things which you can see, and taste, and handle,
which are always changing and passing away: the other in the invisible,
in contact with the unseen; with that which does not change or
pass away—which is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. The
former life you must share with others, with your family, your
schoolfellows and friends, with everyone you meet in business
or pleasure. The latter you must live alone, in the solitude of
your own inmost being, if you can find no Spirit there communing
with yours—in the presence of, and in communion with, the Father
of your spirit, if you are willing to recognize that presence.
The one life will no doubt always be the visible expression of
the other; just as the body is the garment in which the real man
is clothed for his sojourn in time. But the expression is often
little more than a shadow, unsatisfying, misleading. One of our
greatest English poets has written—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"The one remains, the many change and pass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven’s light for ever shines, earth’s shadows fly.<br/>
Time, like a dome of many coloured glass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stains the bright radiance of eternity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until death tramples it to fragments."

</p>
</div>
<p>And so you and I are living now under the dome of many-coloured
glass, and shall live as long as we remain in these bodies, a
temporal and an eternal life—"the next world," which too many
of our teachers speak of as a place which we shall first enter
after death, being in fact "next" only in the truest sense of
the word; namely, that it is "nearest" to us now. The dome of
time can do nothing more (if we even allow it to do that) than
partially to conceal from us the light which is always there,
beneath, around, above us.</p>

<p>"The outer life of the devout man," it has been well said, "should
be thoroughly attractive to others. He would be simple, honest,
straightforward, unpretending, gentle, kindly;—his conversation
cheerful and sensible: he would be ready to share in all blameless
mirth, indulgent to all save sin." And tried by this test, the
best we have at command, my brother was essentially a devout man.</p>

<p>The last thirty years, the years of his manhood, have been a
period of great restlessness and activity, chiefly of a superficial
kind, in matters pertaining specially to religion. The Established
Church, of which he was a member, from conviction as well as by
inheritance, has been passing through a crisis which has often
threatened her existence; faction after faction, as they saw their
chance, rising up and striving in the hope of casting out those
whose opinions or practices they disliked. Against all such attempts
my brother always protested whenever he had an opportunity, and
discouraged all those with whom he had any influence from taking
any part in them.</p>

<p>"I have no patience," for instance, he writes at one of these
crises, "with —— for mixing himself up with Church politics. I
believe you know what I think about them, namely, that both parties
are right in some things and wrong in others, and that the truth
lies between the two. I hope I shall always be able to express
my dissent from both without calling names or imputing motives,
and when I hear others doing so, I am always inclined, like yourself,
to defend the absent. I was very sorry to hear that —— has given
up his parish. I cannot understand his excessive attachment to
what is, after all, only the outside of religion; but he is so
good a man, so hard-working, so self-denying, that one feels what
a great loss he must be."</p>

<p>Outside the Church the same religious unrest has had several
noteworthy results, perhaps the most remarkable of these being
a negative one: I mean, the aggressive attitude and movement of
what is popularly known as scientific thought. Amongst its leaders
have been, and are, some of the best, as well as the ablest, men
of our time, who have had, as they deserved to have, a very striking
influence. But the tone of scientific men towards religion has
been uniformly impatient or contemptuous, not seldom petulant.
"Why go on troubling yourselves and mankind about that of which
you can know nothing?" they have said. "This ‘eternal’ or ‘inner’
life of which you prate is wholly beyond your ken. We can prove
to you that much of your so-called theology rests on unsound premises.
Be content to work and learn with us in the material world, of
which alone you can get to know anything certain." That challenge
has shaken the foundations of much which called itself faith in
our day. I never could discover that my brother was ever seriously
troubled by it. Dissertations on the Mosaic cosmogony, theories
of the origin of species, speculations on the antiquity of man,
and the like, interested, but never seemed to rouse in him any
of the alarm or anger which they have excited in so many good
Christians. Granting all that they tend to prove, they deal only
with the outward garment, with the visible universe, and the life
which must be lived in it, leaving the inner and real life of
mankind quite untouched.</p>

<p>He was, however, neither so tolerant of, nor I think so fair
to, the stirring of thought within the Church, which has resulted
in criticisms supposed to be destructive of much that was held
sacred in the last generation. His keen sense of loyalty was offended
by anything which looked like an attack coming from within the
ranks, and so he shared the feeling so widely, and I think wrongly,
entertained by English Churchmen, that the right of free thought
and free speech on the most sacred subjects should be incompatible
with holding office in the Church.</p>

<p>As to his own convictions on such subjects, he was extremely
reserved, owing to a tendency which he believed he had detected
in himself to religious melancholy, which he treated simply as
a disease. But no one who knew him at all could ever doubt that
a genuine and deep religious faith was the basis of his character,
and those who knew him best testify unanimously to its ever increasing
power. "I don’t know if you were ever told," his sister writes,
"of the singular desire dying people had that George should be
with them. You know how reserved he was, and he would always think
that people would prefer some one who talked more to them, but
I think it was his great gentleness and strength which made the
dying feel him such a comfort. He never volunteered; but when
sent for, as was often the case, always went to them, and read
and prayed constantly with them as long as they lived. There was
one poor young man who died of consumption, and George was constantly
with him to the last. The father was a very disreputable character,
and George seldom saw him. But some time after the young man’s
death, the father met George in the fields, and threw himself
on his knees to bless him for his love for his dead son. George
came home much shocked that the man should have knelt to him.
One old man, whom he used to go to for weeks and weeks during
his long last illness, really adored him, and, when George was
away for a short time, prayed that he might live till he saw him
again. And George was back before he died."</p>

<p>Of this old man, he writes himself to his mother:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"My old friend died on Saturday morning. I mean Tom Pearse, for<br/>
fifty years an honest labourer in this parish. I am very sorry<br/>
that (as he died in the short hours) I could not be with him at<br/>
the last, but very glad that he died before I left Offley. So<br/>
was he. He prayed every day to die, not that he suffered, but<br/>
he had such a strong faith that death would be much better. He<br/>
said to me almost the last time I saw him, ‘I thought, sir, I<br/>
should have been home before this.’ And when he was taken worse<br/>
at last, he asked the nurse, ‘Am I going home?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘I’m so<br/>
glad,’ he answered, and died soon after. What an euthanasia!<br/>
All good people call death going home. ‘Let me die the death of<br/>
the righteous, and my last end be like his.’"

</p>
</div>
<p>Intercourse of the most sacred and intimate kind with the old,
and dying, and suffering of another station in life is, however,
far easier to a man of reserved temper than it is with the young
and healthy. The most difficult class to reach in country villages,
as in our great towns, is that which is entering life, not that
which is thinking of quitting it. You may get young men together
for cricket or football, or even for readings, or in a club, and
attain in the process a certain familiarity with them, useful
enough in its way, but not approaching the kind of intimacy which
should exist between people passing their lives in the same small
community. The effort to do anything more with a class just emancipated
from control, full of strength and health, and as a rule suspicious
of advances from those in a rank above their own, must always
be an exceedingly difficult one to make for such a man as my brother,
and is rarely successful. He made it, and succeeded. During all
the winter months, on every Sunday evening the young men and the
elder boys of the village were invited to his house, and quite
a number of them used to come regularly. They were received by
him and his wife. First he would read a passage of Scripture,
and explain and comment on it, and afterwards he or his wife read
to them some amusing book. He used to speak with the greatest
delight of the pleasure which these meetings seemed to give, and
of their excellent effect on his own relations with the young
men and boys who frequented them. When the time for separating
came, they used all to say the Apostles’ Creed, the Lord’s Prayer,
and the following short prayer, which he wrote[14] for the purpose:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"O Lord God, Thou knowest all things. Thou seest us by night<br/>
as well as by day. We pray Thee, for Christ’s sake, forgive<br/>
us whatever we have done wrong this day. May we be sorry for<br/>
our sins, and believe in Jesus Christ, who died for sinners.<br/>
May the Holy Spirit make us holy. Take care of us this night,<br/>
whilst we are asleep. Bless our fathers and mothers, brothers<br/>
and sisters, and all our relations and friends, and do them<br/>
good, for Christ’s sake. Help us to be good as long as we live,<br/>
and when we die, may we go to heaven and be happy for ever,<br/>
because Christ died for us. Amen."

</p>
</div>
<p>[14] Since this was printed I have heard that the prayer was
not written by him, but only adapted for the use of the boys from
a collection of some Church Society.</p>

<p>If I were to write a volume, I could throw no clearer light on
the inner life of my brother than shines out of this short, simple
prayer, written for village boys, and repeated with them week
by week. Nor is there any other picture of him that I would rather
leave on your minds than this. When I think of the help and strength
which he has been to me and many more, the noble lines on All
Saints’ Day, of the poet I have already quoted in this memoir,
seem to be haunting me, and with them I will end.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"Such lived not in the past alone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But thread to-day the unheeding street,<br/>
And stairs to sin and sorrow known<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing to the welcome of their feet.

</p>
<p>
"The den they enter glows a shrine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The grimy sash an oriel burns,<br/>
Their cup of water warms like wine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their speech is filled from heavenly urns.

</p>
<p>
"Around their brows to me appears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An aureole traced in tenderest light,<br/>
The rainbow gleam of smiles thro’ tears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In dying eyes by them made bright,

</p>
<p>
"Of souls who shivered on the edge<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that chill ford, repassed no more,<br/>
And in their mercy felt the pledge<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweetness of the farther shore."
