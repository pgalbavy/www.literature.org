<p>Scene—Chimneys, 11 <em>A.M. </em>Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Johnson, the police constable, with his coat off, digging.</p>

<p>Something in the nature of a funeral feeling seems to be in the
air. The friends and relations stand round the grave that Johnson
is digging.</p>

<p>George Lomax has the air of the principal beneficiary under the
will of the deceased. Superintendent Battle, with his immovable
face, seems pleased that the funeral arrangements have gone so
nicely. As the undertaker, it reflects credit upon him. Lord Caterham
has that solemn and shocked look which Englishmen assume when
a religious ceremony is in progress.</p>

<p>Mr. Fish does not fit into the picture so well. He is not sufficiently
grave.</p>

<p>Johnson bends to his task. Suddenly he straightens up. A little
stir of excitement passes round.</p>

<p>"That’ll do, sonny," says Mr. Fish. "We shall do nicely now."</p>

<p>One perceives at once that he is really the family physician.</p>

<p>Johnson retires. Mr. Fish, with due solemnity, stoops over the
excavation. The surgeon is about to operate.</p>

<p>He brings out a small canvas package. With much ceremony he hands
it to Superintendent Battle. The latter, in his turn, hands it
to George Lomax. The etiquette of the situation has now been fully
complied with.</p>

<p>George Lomax unwraps the package, slits up the oil-silk inside
it, burrows into further wrapping. For a moment he holds something
on the palm of his hand—then quickly shrouds it once more in cotton
wool.</p>

<p>He clears his throat.</p>

<p>"At this auspicious minute," he begins, with the clear delivery
of the practised speaker.</p>

<p>Lord Caterham beats a precipitate retreat. On the terrace he
finds his daughter.</p>

<p>"Bundle, is that car of yours in order?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"Then take me up to town in it immediately. I’m going abroad
at once—to-day."</p>

<p>"But, father——"</p>

<p>"Don’t argue with me, Bundle. George Lomax told me when he arrived
this morning that he was anxious to have a few words with me privately
on a matter of the utmost delicacy. He added that the King of
Timbuctoo was arriving in London shortly. I won’t go through it
again, Bundle, do you hear? Not for fifty George Lomaxes! If Chimneys
is so valuable to the nation, let the nation buy it. Otherwise
I shall sell it to a syndicate and they can turn it into an hotel."</p>

<p>"Where is Codders now?"</p>

<p>Bundle is rising to the situation.</p>

<p>"At the present minute," replied Lord Caterham, looking at his
watch, "he is good for at least fifteen minutes about the Empire."</p>

<p>Another picture.</p>

<p>Mr. Bill Eversleigh, not invited to be present at the graveside
ceremony, at the telephone.</p>

<p>"No, really, I mean it.... I say, don’t be huffy.... Well, you
will have supper to-night anyway?... No, I haven’t. I’ve been
kept to it with my nose at the grindstone. You’ve no idea what
Codders is like.... I say, Dolly, you know jolly well what I think
about you.... You know I’ve never cared for anyone but you....
Yes, I’ll come to the show first. How does the old wheeze go?
‘And the little girl tries, Hooks and Eyes’...."</p>

<p>Unearthly sounds. Mr. Eversleigh trying to hum the refrain in
question.</p>

<p>And now George’s peroration draws to a close.</p>

<p>... "the lasting peace and prosperity of the British Empire!"</p>

<p>"I guess," said Mr. Hiram Fish <em>sotto voce</em> to himself
and the world at large, "that this has been a great little old
week."</p>
