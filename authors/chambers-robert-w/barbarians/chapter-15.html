<p>Sticky Smith and Kid Glenn remained a week at Sainte Lesse, then
left with the negroes for Calais to help bring up another cargo
of mules, the arrival of which was daily expected.</p>

<p>A peloton of the Train-des-Equipages and three Remount troopers
arrived at Sainte Lesse to take over the corral. John Burley remained
to explain and interpret the American mule to these perplexed
troopers.</p>

<p>Morning, noon, and night he went clanking down to the corral,
his cartridge belt and holster swinging at his hip. But sometimes
he had a little leisure.</p>

<p>Sainte Lesse knew him as a mighty eater and as a lusty drinker
of good red wine; as a mighty and garrulous talker, too, he became
known, ready to accost anybody in the quiet and subdued old town
and explode into French at the slightest encouragement.</p>

<p>But Burley had only women and children and old men on whom to
practice his earnest and voluble French, for everybody else was
at the front.</p>

<p>Children adored him&mdash;adored his big, silver spurs, his cartridge
belt and pistol, the metal mule decorating his tunic collar, his
six feet two of height, his quick smile, the even white teeth
and grayish eyes of this American muleteer, who always had a stick
of barley sugar to give them or an amazing trick to perform for
them with a handkerchief or coin that vanished under their very
noses at the magic snap of his finger.</p>

<p>Old men gossiped willingly with him; women liked him and their
rare smiles in the war-sobered town of Sainte Lesse were often
for him as he sauntered along the quiet street, clanking, swaggering,
affable, ready for conversation with anybody, and always ready
for the small, confident hands that unceremoniously clasped his
when he passed by where children played.</p>

<p>As for Maryette Courtray, called Carillonnette, she mounted the
bell-tower once every hour, from six in the morning until nine
o’clock in the evening, to play the passing of Time toward that
eternity into which it is always and ceaselessly moving.</p>

<p>After nine o’clock Carillonnette set the drum and wound it; and
through the dark hours of the night the bells played mechanically
every hour for a few moments before Bayard struck.</p>

<p>Between these duties the girl managed the old inn, to which,
since the war, nobody came any more&mdash;and with these occupations
her life was full&mdash;sufficiently full, perhaps, without the advent
of John Burley.</p>

<p>They met with enough frequency for her, if not for him. Their
encounters took place between her duties aloft at the keyboard
under the successive tiers of bells and his intervals of prowling
among his mules.</p>

<p>Sometimes he found her sewing in the parlour&mdash;she could have
gone to her own room, of course; sometimes he encountered her
in the corridor, in the street, in the walled garden behind the
inn, where with basket and pan she gathered vegetables in season.</p>

<p>There was a stone seat out there, built against the southern
wall, and in the shadowed coolness of it she sometimes shelled
peas.</p>

<p>During such an hour of liberty from the bell-tower he found the
dark-eyed little mistress of the bells sorting various vegetables
and singing under her breath to herself the carillon music of
Josef Denyn.</p>

<p>"Tray chick, mademoiselle," he said, with a cheerful self-assertion,
to hide the embarrassment which always assailed him when he encountered
her.</p>

<p>"You know, Monsieur Burley, you should not say ’<em>très chic</em>’
to me," she said, shaking her pretty head. "It sounds a little
familiar and a little common."</p>

<p>"Oh," he exclaimed, very red. "I thought it was the thing to
say."</p>

<p>She smiled, continuing to shell the peas, then, with her sensitive
and slightly flushed face still lowered, she looked at him out
of her dark blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," she said, "young men say ’<em>très chic</em>.’ It
depend on when and how one says it."</p>

<p>"Are there times when it is all right for me to say it?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so.... How are your mules today?"</p>

<p>"The same," he said, "&mdash;ready to bite or kick or eat their heads
off. The Remount took two hundred this morning."</p>

<p>"I saw them pass," said the girl. "I thought perhaps you also
might be departing."</p>

<p>"Without coming to say good-bye&mdash;to <em>you</em>!" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Oh, conventions must be disregarded in time of war," she returned
carelessly, continuing to shell peas. "I really thought I saw
you riding away with the mules."</p>

<p>"That man," said Burley, much hurt, "was a bow-legged driver
of the Train-des-Equipages. I don’t think he resembles me."</p>

<p>As she made no comment and expressed no contrition for her mistake,
he gazed about him at the sunny garden with a depressed expression.
However, this changed presently to a bright and hopeful one.</p>

<p>"Vooz ate tray, tray belle, mademoiselle!" he asserted cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Monsieur!" Vexed perhaps as much at her own quick blush as his
abrupt eulogy, she bit her lip and looked at him with an ominously
level gaze. Then, suddenly, she smiled.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Burley, one does <em>not</em> so express one’s self
without reason, without apropos, without&mdash;without encouragement&#11834;"</p>

<p>She blushed again, vividly. Under her wide straw hat her delicate,
sensitive face and dark blue eyes were beautiful enough to inspire
eulogy in any young man.</p>

<p>"Pardon," he said, confused by her reprimand and her loveliness.
"I shall hereafter only <em>think</em> you are pretty, mademoiselle&mdash;mais
je ne le dirais ploo."</p>

<p>"That would be perhaps more&mdash;<em>comme il faut</em>, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Ploo!" he repeated with emphasis. "Ploo jamais! Je vous jure&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Merci</em>; it is not perhaps necessary to swear quite so
solemnly, monsieur."</p>

<p>She raised her eyes from the pan, moving her small, sun-tanned
hand through the heaps of green peas, filling her palm with them
and idly letting them run through her slim fingers.</p>

<p>"L’amour," he said with an effort&mdash;"how funny it is&mdash;isn’t it,
mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it," she replied with decision, and rose
with her pan of peas.</p>

<p>"Are you going, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have I offended you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He trailed after her down the garden path between rows of blue
larkspurs and hollyhocks&mdash;just at her dainty heels, because the
brick walk was too narrow for both of them.</p>

<p>"Ploo," he repeated appealingly.</p>

<p>Over her shoulder she said with disdain:</p>

<p>"It is not a topic for conversation among the young, monsieur&mdash;what
you call <em>l’amour</em>." And she entered the kitchen, where
he had not the effrontery to follow her.</p>

<p>That evening, toward sunset, returning from the corral, he heard,
high in the blue sky above him, her bell-music drifting; and involuntarily
uncovering, he stood with bared head looking upward while the
celestial melody lasted.</p>

<p>And that evening, too, being the fête of Alincourt, a tiny neighbouring
village across the river, the bell-mistress went up into the tower
after dinner and played for an hour for the little neighbour hamlet
across the river Lesse.</p>

<p>All the people who remained in Sainte Lesse and in Alincourt
brought out their chairs and their knitting in the calm, fragrant
evening air and remained silent, sadly enraptured while the unseen
player at her keyboard aloft in the belfry above set her carillon
music adrift under the summer stars&mdash;golden harmonies that seemed
born in the heavens from which they floated; clear, exquisitely
sweet miracles of melody filling the world of darkness with magic
messages of hope.</p>

<p>Those widowed or childless among her listeners for miles around
in the darkness wept quiet tears, less bitter and less hopeless
for the divine promise of the sky music which filled the night
as subtly as the scent of flowers saturates the dusk.</p>

<p>Burley, listening down by the corral, leaned against a post,
one powerful hand across his eyes, his cap clasped in the other,
and in his heart the birth of things ineffable.</p>

<p>For an hour the carillon played. Then old Bayard struck ten times.
And Burley thought of the trenches and wondered whether the mellow
thunder of the great bell was audible out there that night.</p>
