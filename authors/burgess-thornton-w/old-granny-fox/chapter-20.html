No one ever is so smart that some one else<br/>
may not prove to be smarter still.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

</p>
</div>
<p>Listen and you shall hear all about three rogues. Two were in
red and were Granny and Reddy Fox. And one was in gray and was
Old Man Coyote. They were the slyest, smartest rogues on all the
Green Meadows or in all the Green Forest. All three had started
out to steal the same dinner, but the funny part is they didn't
intend to steal it from the same person. And still funnier is
it that one of them didn't even know where that dinner was or
what kind of a dinner it would be.</p>

<p>True to his resolve to know what Granny and Reddy Fox were getting
to eat, and where they were getting it, Old Man Coyote hid where
he could see what was going on about Farmer Brown's, for it was
there he felt sure that Granny and Reddy were getting food. He
had waited only a little while when along came Granny and Reddy
Fox past the place where Old Man Coyote was hiding. They didn't
see him. Of course not. He took care that they should have no
chance. But anyway, they were not thinking of him. Their thoughts
were all of that dinner they intended to have, and the smart trick
by which they would get it.</p>

<p>So with their thoughts all on that dinner they slipped up behind
the barn and prepared to work the trick which had been so successful
before. Old Man Coyote crept after them. He saw Reddy Fox lie
down where he could peep around the corner of the barn to watch
Bowser the Hound and to see that no one else was about. He saw
Granny leave Reddy there and hurry away. Old Man Coyote's wits
worked fast.</p>

<p>"I can't be in two places at once," thought he, "so I can't watch
both Granny and Reddy. As I can watch but one, which one shall
it be? Granny, of course. Granny is the smartest of the two, and
whatever they are up to, she is at the bottom of it. Granny is
the one to follow."</p>

<p>So, like a gray shadow, crafty Old Man Coyote stole after Granny
Fox and saw her hide behind the corner of the shed at the end
of which was the little house of Bowser the Hound. He crept as
near as he dared and then lay flat down behind a little bunch
of dead grass close to the shed. For some time nothing happened,
and Old Man Coyote was puzzled. Every once in a while Granny Fox
would look behind and all about to be sure that no danger was
near, but she didn't see Old Man Coyote. After what seemed to
him a long time, he heard a door open on the other side of the
shed. It was Mrs. Brown carrying Bowser's dinner out to him. Of
course, Old Man Coyote didn't know this. He knew by the sounds
that some one had come out of the house, and it made him nervous.
He didn't like being so close to Farmer Brown's house in broad
daylight. But he kept his eyes on Granny Fox, and he saw her ears
prick up in a way that he knew meant that those sounds were just
what she had been waiting for.</p>

<p>"If she isn't afraid, I don't need to be," thought he craftily.
After a few minutes he heard a door close and knew that whoever
had come out had gone back into the house. Almost at once Bowser
the Hound began to yelp and whine. Swiftly Granny Fox disappeared
around the corner of the shed. Just as swiftly Old Man Coyote
ran forward and peeped around the corner. There was Bowser the
Hound tugging at his chain, and just beyond his reach was Reddy
Fox, grinning in the most provoking manner. And there was Granny
Fox, backing and dragging after her Bowser's dinner. In a flash
Old Man Coyote understood the plan, and he almost chuckled aloud
at the cleverness of it. Then he hastily backed behind the shed
and waited. In a minute Granny Fox appeared, dragging Bowser's
dinner. She was so intent on getting that dinner that she almost
backed into Old Man Coyote without suspecting that he was anywhere
about.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Granny. You needn't bother about it any longer; I'll
take it now," growled Old Man Coyote in Granny's ear.</p>

<p>Granny let go of that dinner as if it burned her tongue, and
with a frightened little yelp leaped to one side. A minute later
Reddy came racing around from behind the barn eager for his share.
What he saw was Old Man Coyote bolting down that twice-stolen
dinner while Granny Fox fairly danced with rage.</p>
