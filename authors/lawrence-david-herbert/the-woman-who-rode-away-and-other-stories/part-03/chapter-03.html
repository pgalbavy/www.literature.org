<p>The end of February was suddenly very hot.  Almond blossom was
falling like pink snow, in the touch of the smallest breeze.  The
mauve, silky little anemones were out, the asphodels tall in bud,
and the sea was corn-flower blue.</p>

<p>Juliet had ceased to care about anything.  Now, most of the day,
she and the child were naked in the sun, and it was all she wanted.
Sometimes she went down to the sea to bathe: often she wandered in
the gullies where the sun shone in, and she was out of sight.
Sometimes she saw a peasant with an ass, and he saw her.  But she
went so simply and quietly with her child; and the fame of the
sun's healing power, for the soul as well as for the body, had
already spread among the people; so that there was no excitement.</p>

<p>The child and she were now both tanned with a rosy-golden tan, all
over.  &quot;I am another being,&quot; she said to herself, as she looked at
her red-gold breasts and thighs.</p>

<p>The child, too, was another creature, with a peculiar, quiet, sun-
darkened absorption.  Now he played by himself in silence, and she
need hardly notice him.  He seemed no longer to notice when he was
alone.</p>

<p>There was not a breeze, and the sea was ultramarine.  She sat by
the great silver paw of the cypress tree, drowsed in the sun, but
her breasts alert, full of sap.  She was becoming aware of an
activity rousing in her, an activity which would bring another self
awake in her.  She still did not want to be aware.  The new rousing
would mean a new contact, and this she did not want.  She knew well
enough the vast cold apparatus of civilisation, and what contact
with it meant; and how difficult it was to evade.</p>

<p>The child had gone a few yards down the rocky path, round the great
sprawling of a cactus.  She had seen him, a real gold-brown infant
of the winds, with burnt gold hair and red cheeks, collecting the
speckled pitcher-flowers and laying them in rows.  He could balance
now, and was quick for his own emergencies, like an absorbed young
animal playing.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard him speaking:  Look, Mummy!  Mummy look!  A note
in his bird-like voice made her lean forward sharply.</p>

<p>Her heart stood still.  He was looking over his naked little
shoulder at her, and pointing with a loose little hand at a snake
which had reared itself up a yard away from him, and was opening
its mouth so that its forked, soft tongue flickered black like a
shadow, uttering a short hiss.</p>

<p>&quot;Look!  Mummy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, darling, it's a snake!&quot; came the slow deep voice.  He looked
at her, his wide blue eyes uncertain whether to be afraid or not.
Some stillness of the sun in her reassured him.</p>

<p>&quot;Snake!&quot; he chirped.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, darling!  Don't touch it, it can bite.&quot;</p>

<p>The snake had sunk down, and was reaching away from the coils in
which it had been basking asleep, and slowly easing its long, gold-
brown body into the rocks, with slow curves.  The boy turned and
watched it in silence.  Then he said:</p>

<p>&quot;Snake going!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!  Let it go.  It likes to be alone.&quot;</p>

<p>He still watched the slow, easing length as the creature drew
itself apathetic out of sight.</p>

<p>&quot;Snake gone back,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it is gone back.  Come to Mummy a moment.&quot;</p>

<p>He came and sat with his plump, naked little body on her naked lap,
and she smoothed his burnt, bright hair.  She said nothing, feeling
that everything was past.  The curious careless power of the sun
filled her, filled the whole place like a charm, and the snake was
part of the place, along with her and the child.</p>

<p>Another day, in the dry stone wall of one of the olive terraces,
she saw a black snake horizontally creeping.</p>

<p>&quot;Marinina,&quot; she said, &quot;I saw a black snake.  Are they harmful?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, the black snakes, no!  But the yellow ones, yes!  If the
yellow ones bite you, you die.  But they frighten me, they frighten
me, even the black ones, when I see one.&quot;</p>

<p>Juliet still went to the cypress tree with the child.  But she
always looked carefully round, before she sat down, examining
everywhere the child might go.  Then she would lie and turn to the
sun again, her tanned, pear-shaped breasts pointing up.  She would
take no thought for the morrow.  She refused to think outside the
garden, and she could not write letters.  She would tell the nurse
to write.  So she lay in the sun, but not for long, for it was
getting strong, fierce.  And in spite of herself, the bud that had
been tight and deep immersed in the innermost gloom of her, was
rearing, rearing and straightening its curved stem, to open its
dark tips and show a gleam of rose.  Her womb was coming open wide
with rosy ecstasy, like a lotus flower.</p>
