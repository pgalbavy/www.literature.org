<p>Actuated by his resolution to learn the real meaning of the signal
fire seen on the crest of the ridge, Warren Starr pushed on in
the face of the fact that every rod in the way of advance increased
his own peril. Studying the contour of the country, and carefully
making his calculations, he was able to tell when he drew near
the scene of his stirring encounter with the war party of Sioux.
Deeming it unsafe to ride farther, he drew his pony aside, and,
dismounting, led him among the rocks and trees, until he was beyond
sight of anyone passing over the open country. He did not forget
that a plain trail was left, which would serve as an unerring
guide to those hostiles who might come upon it, but that was one
of the risks of the undertaking which could not be avoided.</p>

<p>"Now, Jack, my boy, I want you to stay right here till I come
back again," he said, in parting from the animal. "You have been
faithful and have served me well, and I can depend upon you, for
you are sure to do the best you can."</p>

<p>There could be no doubt on that point, and without any more delay
he left the creature and began toiling up the ascent, his Winchester
firmly in his grasp, and as alert as ever for the sudden appearance
of his enemies.</p>

<p>An astounding surprise was at hand.</p>

<p>He had penetrated but a short distance from his starting point
when he became aware that someone else was in the vicinity. He
caught only a flitting glimpse of a person, who, descrying him
at the same instant, whisked behind a bowlder for protection.
Warren was equally prompt, and the two dodged out of each other's
sight in a twinkling.</p>

<p>"If there is only one Indian," reflected the young rancher, "I
ought to be able to take care of myself&mdash;great Heavens!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was caused by the sight of Tim Brophy, who stepped
from behind the shelter and walked toward him.</p>

<p>Young Starr was astounded, and believed for a minute that his
friend had been put forward as a decoy, and that his captors were
immediately behind him. But that dread was removed the next moment
by the appearance of the young Irishman, who, advancing jauntily,
called out in his cheery voice:</p>

<p>"It's all roight, me boy! None of the spalpeens are here, and
it's mesilf that would like to shake ye by the hand."</p>

<p>That the two warmly grasped hands and greeted each other need
not be stated. Even then Warren could only murmur:</p>

<p>"Why, Tim, this is the greatest surprise of my life! Where in
the name of the seven wonders did you come from? and how came
you to give them the slip?"</p>

<p>"It was that which helped me out," replied the other, holding
up his clenched fist; "it b'ats all other wippons whin ye git
into a tight corner."</p>

<p>Not until the fellow had told his story could the other comprehend
the amazing truth. Then he saw how a marvellous combination of
circumstances had helped him, and how cleverly the quick-witted
youth had turned them to account.</p>

<p>"I must shake hands with you again," responded the delighted
Warren. "I never knew of anything more remarkable."</p>

<p>"Ye didn't think ye could give me any hilp," chuckled Tim, "but
ye did it all the same."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Haven't I told ye that the little circus ye opened out on the
plain drew away all the spalpeens but the single one lift to look
after me? And don't ye understand that ye made things so interesting
that he forgot me until I reminded him I was there by giving him
a welt under the ear that he won't forgit in a dog's age?"</p>

<p>"I see; but I never dreamed of any such result as that."</p>

<p>"Nor did I, but it came all the same, and sarved me as will as
if ye had fixed up the whole business."</p>

<p>Noticing the strange weapon in his hand Warren referred to it,
and then received the whole story.</p>

<p>"Well, it beats anything I ever heard of. Jack isn't far off,
and we can use him as we did before."</p>

<p>"And may I ask what ye are doing here so close to the spalpeens,
whin ye ought to be miles away?"</p>

<p>"I set out to learn whether that fire whose smoke we saw was
started by father or not. I didn't think so when you and I were
talking it over, but can't rid myself of the suspicion till I
find out for myself."</p>

<p>Tim nodded his head, and said:</p>

<p>"Yis; it was Mr. Starr that did it."</p>

<p>"How can you know that?"</p>

<p>"I've been there, and found out," was the surprising reply.</p>

<p>"Where are he and mother now?"</p>

<p>"Can't say; I'm looking for them. Whin I give the spalpeens the
slip I did the best travelling I knew how, and without thinking
of anything but getting away as quick as I could I coom right
onto the spot where the fire had been burning. It hadn't gone
out yit, but it was so nearly so that it give no smoke. Looking
around it did not take me long to l'arn that two horses had been
there&#11834;"</p>

<p>"They had three with them, as you told me."</p>

<p>"But they have only two now. I wouldn't have been sartin of the
matter if I hadn't seen the print of yer mother's small shoe in
the snow, and while I was looking I obsarved that of Dot, no bigger
than Cinderella hersilf might have made."</p>

<p>Warren was profoundly interested, and tears dimmed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Was there no man with father?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't see any footprints except his."</p>

<p>"Then it has been as you said: Plummer was killed by the Sioux.
But surely you noticed the direction they took?"</p>

<p>"I did that same, and was following their trail whin I cotched
sight of yersilf among the trees, and coom nigh shooting ye before
asking for an inthrodooction."</p>

<p>"Then they have passed nigh this spot?" asked the startled son.</p>

<p>Tim partly turned and pointed behind him.</p>

<p>"Right beyant is the thracks made by thimsilves and their animals,
for the ground won't admit of their riding."</p>

<p>"I wish it were otherwise," remarked Warren thoughtfully, "for
I have had the hope that they might be so near the fort as to
be safe. They are not, but we ought to join them quite soon. But,
Tim," added his friend, as if alarmed by a new fear, "the Sioux
must have learned of your flight long ago, and are now on your
trail."</p>

<p>"I must say that I'm forced to agree wid ye," was the reply of
the Irishman, spoken as though the question was of trifling import.</p>

<p>"It won't do for us to stay here. They are liable to appear at
any moment," and the alarmed youth glanced apprehensively around,
as if he expected to see the whole party of hostiles burst through
upon them.</p>

<p>"Jack is strong enough to carry us a long way," he added, "and
since he is close at hand I can lead him out on the open plain,
where we shall gain such a good start that there will be little
chance of their overtaking us."</p>

<p>"No doubt ye are corrict."</p>

<p>"Then let's do it without throwing away another moment."</p>

<p>He turned hurriedly to carry out his own purpose, when his comrade
laid his hand on his arm and detained him.</p>

<p>"I think, Warry," he said, in a low voice, "that ye've forgot
one matter&mdash;yer fayther, mither, and Dot."</p>

<p>"Gracious! how came I to do that? Here I set out to hunt for
them, and when they were as good as found I turn my back upon
them, and think only of my own safety."</p>

<p>"Ye are excoosable, since ye have been upsit by the thrifling
occurrences that have been going on this day."</p>

<p>"Take me to the spot where you left their trail," added Warren,
with unusual excitement, "and we'll never leave it until we join
them; we shall escape or die together."</p>

<p>The youths moved like those who knew that the question of life
and death must be settled within a few minutes.</p>
