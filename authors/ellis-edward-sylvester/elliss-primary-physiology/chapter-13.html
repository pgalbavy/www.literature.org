<p>There can be no good health without pure air. Always have it
if possible. Before you lie down to sleep at night, make sure
your windows are lowered at the top and slightly raised at the
bottom, so that the room is well ventilated. If the bed has enough
covering, you will sleep much better if the air is fresh and cool.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>It is a good practice to spend a few minutes early in the morning,
in drawing into the lungs all the air they can possibly hold.
Then breathe out slowly, by keeping the lips almost closed. While
doing so, rapidly thump the chest and ribs with the flat sides
of your fists. This will expand your lungs and prevent the congestion
or settling of blood among many of the organs, besides strengthening
and toning up the system.</p>

<em>PROPER USE OF CLOTHING</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Your parents furnish you with warm, comfortable clothing, but
much depends on you whether it shall help preserve your health.
Children often catch cold and more serious diseases by carelessness
about their dress. Be careful that all your garments sit well
and are not loose enough to annoy you, nor tight enough to cause
discomfort.</p>

<p>Boys should lay off their overcoats and overshoes, girls their
wraps and overshoes when they enter a warm room. Always put them
on before going out in the cold or wet. Neglect in following this
rule has often caused pneumonia and death.</p>

<p>
<em>DAMP CLOTHING</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>If the clothing, shoes or stockings become wet, they should be
changed at the earliest moment. If there is no chance to make
such change, keep in motion until the garments can be replaced
by others. If the moisture has reached the skin, it should be
rubbed with a rough towel until dry and warm.</p>

<p>
<em>DANGERS TO HEALTH</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Before summer sets in, children are often tempted to sit or lie
on the damp earth. This is hurtful and never should be done, even
in warm weather.</p>

<p>When heated from exercise, boys love to throw aside their outer
clothing, so as to "cool off." This is dangerous; better to feel
uncomfortable for a little while until your body resumes its natural
temperature.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>COLD OR DRAFT</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Never sit in a cold room or a draft. It is sure to injure you
and may cause death. If you feel chilly, warm yourself by vigorous
exercise.</p>

<p>Always obey the promptings of nature. Failure to do so poisons
the blood, causes serious disease, and frequently destroys life
itself.</p>

<p>  Show the necessity of pure air. What precaution should be taken  
before lying down to sleep? What of drafts? What are necessary
to   sleep well?</p>

<p>  What is a good practice for each morning? What will this do?</p>

<p>  What depends upon you? What results from carelessness in these  
respects? Of what ought you to be careful?</p>

<p>  What use should be made of overcoats, wraps, and overshoes?
What has   resulted from neglect to follow this rule?</p>

<p>  What is the proper course, when the clothing, shoes or stockings  
become wet?</p>

<p>  What are children often tempted to do in the spring of the
year? Is   it a safe thing to do at any time?</p>

<p>  What is said about "cooling off?"</p>

<p>  What about sitting in a cold room or draft?</p>

<p>  What other advice is given? </p>
