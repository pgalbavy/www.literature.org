<p>That evening, at about half-past seven o'clock, dinner being
over and Mr. and Mrs. Baxter (parents of William) seated in the
library, Mrs. Baxter said:</p>

<p>"I think it's about time for you to go and dress for your Emerson
Club meeting, papa, if you intend to go."</p>

<p>"Do I have to dress?" Mr. Baxter asked, plaintively.</p>

<p>"I think nearly all the men do, don't they?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"But I'm getting old enough not to have to, don't you think,
mamma?" he urged, appealingly. "When a man's my age&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" she said. "Your figure is exactly like William's.
It's the figure that really shows age first, and yours hasn't
begun to." And she added, briskly, "Go along like a good boy and
get it ever!"</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter rose submissively and went upstairs to do as he was
bid. But, after fifteen or twenty minutes, during which his footsteps
had been audible in various parts of the house, he called down
over the banisters:</p>

<p>"I can't find 'em."</p>

<p>"Can't find what?"</p>

<p>"My evening clothes. They aren't anywhere in the house."</p>

<p>"Where did you put them the last time you wore them?" she called.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I haven't had 'em on since last spring."</p>

<p>"All right; I'll come," she said, putting her sewing upon the
table and rising. "Men never can find anything," she observed,
additionally, as she ascended the stairs. "Especially their own
things!"</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, as she was obliged to admit a little
later, women were not more efficacious than the duller sex. Search
high, search low, no trace of Mr. Baxter's evening clothes were
to be found. "Perhaps William could find them," said Mrs. Baxter,
a final confession of helplessness.</p>

<p>But William was no more to be found than the missing apparel.
William, in fact, after spending some time in the lower back hall,
listening to the quest above, had just gone out through the kitchen
door. And after some ensuing futile efforts, Mr. Baxter was forced
to proceed to his club in the accoutrements of business.</p>

<p>He walked slowly, enjoying the full moon, which sailed up a river
in the sky&mdash;the open space between the trees that lined the street&mdash;and
as he passed the house of Mr. Parcher he noted the fine white
shape of a masculine evening bosom gleaming in the moonlight on
the porch. A dainty figure in white sat beside it, and there was
another white figure present, though this one was so small that
Mr. Baxter did not see it at all. It was the figure of a tiny
doglet, and it reposed upon the black masculine knees that belonged
to the evening bosom.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter heard a dulcet voice.</p>

<p>"He IS indifferink, isn't he, sweetest Flopit? Seriously, though,
Mr. Watson was telling me about you to-day. He says you're the
most indifferent man he knows. He says you don't care two minutes
whether a girl lives or dies. Isn't he a mean ole wicked sing,
p'eshus Flopit!"</p>

<p>The reply was inaudible, and Mr. Baxter passed on, having recognized
nothing of his own.</p>

<p>"These <em>YOUNG </em>fellows don't have any trouble finding
their dress-suits, I guess," he murmured. "Not on a night like
this!"</p>

<p>... Thus William, after a hard day, came to the gates of his
romance, entering those portals of the moon in triumph. At one
stroke his dashing raiment gave him high superiority over Johnnie
Watson and other rivals who might loom. But if he had known to
what undoing this great coup exposed him, it is probable that
Mr. Baxter would have appeared at the Emerson Club, that night,
in evening clothes.</p>
