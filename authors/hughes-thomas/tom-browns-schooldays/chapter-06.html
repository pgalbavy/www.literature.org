<blockquote>&quot;Some food we had.&quot; - Shakespeare.<br>
[Greek text] - Theocr. Id.</blockquote>
<P>As the boys scattered away from the ground, and East, leaning on
Tom's arm, and limping along, was beginning to consider what
luxury they should go and buy for tea to celebrate that glorious
victory, the two Brookes came striding by.  Old Brooke caught
sight of East, and stopped; put his hand kindly on his shoulder,
and said, &quot;Bravo, youngster; you played famously.  Not much the
matter, I hope?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, nothing at all,&quot; said East - &quot; only a little twist from
that charge.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, mind and get all right for next Saturday.&quot;  And the
leader passed on, leaving East better for those few words than
all the opodeldoc in England would have made him, and Tom ready
to give one of his ears for as much notice.  Ah! light words of
those whom we love and honour, what a power ye are, and how
carelessly wielded by those who can use you!  Surely for these
things also God will ask an account.</P>
<P>&quot;Tea's directly after locking-up, you see,&quot; said East, hobbling
along as fast as he could, &quot;so you come along down to Sally
Harrowell's; that's our School-house tuck-shop.  She bakes such
stunning murphies, we'll have a penn'orth each for tea.  Come
along, or they'll all be gone.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom's new purse and money burnt in his pocket; he wondered, as
they toddled through the quadrangle and along the street,
whether East would be insulted if he suggested further
extravagance, as he had not sufficient faith in a pennyworth of
potatoes. At last he blurted out, -</P>
<P>&quot;I say, East, can't we get something else besides potatoes?
I've got lots of money, you know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bless us, yes; I forgot,&quot; said East, &quot;you've only just come.
You see all my tin's been gone this twelve weeks - it hardly
ever lasts beyond the first fortnight; and our allowances were
all stopped this morning for broken windows, so I haven't got a
penny.  I've got a tick at Sally's, of course; but then I hate
running it high, you see, towards the end of the half, 'cause
one has to shell out for it all directly one comes back, and
that's a bore.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom didn't understand much of this talk, but seized on the fact
that East had no money, and was denying himself some little pet
luxury in consequence.  &quot;Well, what shall I buy?&quot; said he, &quot;I'm
uncommon hungry.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I say,&quot; said East, stopping to look at him and rest his leg,
&quot;you're a trump, Brown.  I'll do the same by you next half.
Let's have a pound of sausages then.  That's the best grub for
tea I know of.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Tom, as pleased as possible; &quot;where do they
sell them?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, over here, just opposite.&quot;  And they crossed the street and
walked into the cleanest little front room of a small house,
half parlour, half shop, and bought a pound of most particular
sausages, East talking pleasantly to Mrs. Porter while she put
them in paper, and Tom doing the paying part.</P>
<P>From Porter's they adjourned to Sally Harrowell's, where they
found a lot of School-house boys waiting for the roast potatoes,
and relating their own exploits in the day's match at the top of
their voices.  The street opened at once into Sally's kitchen, a
low brick-floored room, with large recess for fire, and chimney-
corner seats.  Poor little Sally, the most good-natured and
much-enduring of womankind, was bustling about, with a napkin in
her hand, from her own oven to those of the neighbours' cottages
up the yard at the back of the house.  Stumps, her husband, a
short, easy-going shoemaker, with a beery, humorous eye and
ponderous calves, who lived mostly on his wife's earnings, stood
in a corner of the room, exchanging shots of the roughest
description of repartee with every boy in turn.  &quot;Stumps, you
lout, you've had too much beer again to-day.&quot;  &quot;'Twasn't of your
paying for, then.&quot;  &quot;Stumps's calves are running down into his
ankles; they want to get to grass.&quot;  &quot;Better be doing that than
gone altogether like yours,&quot; etc.  Very poor stuff it was, but
it served to make time pass; and every now and then Sally
arrived in the middle with a smoking tin of potatoes, which was
cleared off in a few seconds, each boy as he seized his lot
running off to the house with &quot;Put me down two-penn'orth,
Sally;&quot; &quot;Put down three-penn'orth between me and Davis,&quot; etc.
How she ever kept the accounts so straight as she did, in her
head and on her slate, was a perfect wonder.</P>
<P>East and Tom got served at last, and started back for the
School-house, just as the locking-up bell began to ring, East on
the way recounting the life and adventures of Stumps, who was a
character.  Amongst his other small avocations, he was the hind
carrier of a sedan-chair, the last of its race, in which the
Rugby ladies still went out to tea, and in which, when he was
fairly harnessed and carrying a load, it was the delight of
small and mischievous boys to follow him and whip his calves.
This was too much for the temper even of Stumps, and he would
pursue his tormentors in a vindictive and apoplectic manner when
released, but was easily pacified by twopence to buy beer with.</P>
<P>The lower-school boys of the School-house, some fifteen in
number, had tea in the lower-fifth school, and were presided
over by the old verger or head-porter.  Each boy had a quarter
of a loaf of bread and pat of butter, and as much tea as he
pleased; and there was scarcely one who didn't add to this some
further luxury, such as baked potatoes, a herring, sprats, or
something of the sort.  But few at this period of the half-year
could live up to a pound of Porter's sausages, and East was in
great magnificence upon the strength of theirs.  He had produced
a toasting-fork from his study, and set Tom to toast the
sausages, while he mounted guard over their butter and potatoes.
&quot;'Cause,&quot; as he explained, &quot;you're a new boy, and they'll play
you some trick and get our butter; but you can toast just as
well as I.&quot;  So Tom, in the midst of three or four more urchins
similarly employed, toasted his face and the sausages at the
same time before the huge fire, till the latter cracked; when
East from his watch-tower shouted that they were done, and then
the feast proceeded, and the festive cups of tea were filled and
emptied, and Tom imparted of the sausages in small bits to many
neighbours, and thought he had never tasted such good potatoes
or seen such jolly boys.  They on their parts waived all
ceremony, and pegged away at the sausages and potatoes, and
remembering Tom's performance in goal, voted East's new crony a
brick.  After tea, and while the things were being cleared away,
they gathered round the fire, and the talk on the match still
went on; and those who had them to show pulled up their trousers
and showed the hacks they had received in the good cause.</P>
<P>They were soon, however, all turned out of the school; and East
conducted Tom up to his bedroom, that he might get on clean
things, and wash himself before singing.</P>
<P>&quot;What's singing?&quot; said Tom, taking his head out of his basin,
where he had been plunging it in cold water.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, you are jolly green,&quot; answered his friend, from a
neighbouring basin.  &quot;Why, the last six Saturdays of every half
we sing of course; and this is the first of them.  No first
lesson to do, you know, and lie in bed to-morrow morning.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But who sings?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, everybody, of course; you'll see soon enough.  We begin
directly after supper, and sing till bed-time.  It ain't such
good fun now, though, as in the summer half; 'cause then we sing
in the little fives court, under the library, you know.  We take
out tables, and the big boys sit round and drink beer - double
allowance on Saturday nights; and we cut about the quadrangle
between the songs, and it looks like a lot of robbers in a cave.
And the louts come and pound at the great gates, and we pound
back again, and shout at them.  But this half we only sing in
the hall.  Come along down to my study.&quot;</P>
<P>Their principal employment in the study was to clear out East's
table; removing the drawers and ornaments and tablecloth; for he
lived in the bottom passage, and his table was in requisition
for the singing.</P>
<P>Supper came in due course at seven o'clock, consisting of bread
and cheese and beer, which was all saved for the singing; and
directly afterwards the fags went to work to prepare the hall.
The School-house hall, as has been said, is a great long high
room, with two large fires on one side, and two large iron-bound
tables, one running down the middle, and the other along the
wall opposite the fireplaces.  Around the upper fire the fags
placed the tables in the form of a horse-shoe, and upon them the
jugs with the Saturday night's allowance of beer.  Then the big
boys used to drop in and take their seats, bringing with them
bottled beer and song books; for although they all knew the
songs by heart, it was the thing to have an old manuscript book
descended from some departed hero, in which they were all
carefully written out.</P>
<P>The sixth-form boys had not yet appeared; so, to fill up the
gap, an interesting and time-honoured ceremony was gone through.
Each new boy was placed on the table in turn, and made to sing a
solo, under the penalty of drinking a large mug of salt and
water if he resisted or broke down.  However, the new boys all
sing like nightingales to-night, and the salt water is not in
requisition - Tom, as his part, performing the old west-country
song of &quot;The Leather Bottel&quot; with considerable applause.  And at
the half-hour down come the sixth and fifth form boys, and take
their places at the tables, which are filled up by the next
biggest boys, the rest, for whom there is no room at the table,
standing round outside.</P>
<P>The glasses and mugs are filled, and then the fugleman strikes
up the old sea-song,</P>
<blockquote>&quot;A wet sheet and a flowing sea,<br>
And a wind that follows fast,&quot; etc.,</blockquote>
<P>which is the invariable first song in the School-house; and all
the seventy voices join in, not mindful of harmony, but bent on
noise, which they attain decidedly, but the general effect isn't
bad.  And then follow &quot;The British Grenadiers,&quot; &quot;Billy Taylor,&quot;
&quot;The Siege of Seringapatam,&quot; &quot;Three Jolly Postboys,&quot; and other
vociferous songs in rapid succession, including &quot;The Chesapeake
and Shannon,&quot; a song lately introduced in honour of old Brooke;
and when they come to the words,</P>
<blockquote>&quot;Brave Broke he waved his sword, crying, Now, my lads, aboard,
And we'll stop their playing Yankee-doodle-dandy oh!&quot;</blockquote>
<P>you expect the roof to come down.  The sixth and fifth know that
&quot;brave Broke&quot; of the Shannon was no sort of relation to our old
Brooke.  The fourth form are uncertain in their belief, but for
the most part hold that old Brooke was a midshipman then on
board his uncle's ship.  And the lower school never doubt for a
moment that it was our old Brooke who led the boarders, in what
capacity they care not a straw.  During the pauses the bottled-
beer corks fly rapidly, and the talk is fast and merry, and the
big boys - at least all of them who have a fellow-feeling for
dry throats - hand their mugs over their shoulders to be emptied
by the small ones who stand round behind.</P>
<P>Then Warner, the head of the house, gets up and wants to speak;
but he can't, for every boy knows what's coming.  And the big
boys who sit at the tables pound them and cheer; and the small
boys who stand behind pound one another, and cheer, and rush
about the hall cheering.  Then silence being made, Warner
reminds them of the old School-house custom of drinking the
healths, on the first night of singing, of those who are going
to leave at the end of the half.  &quot;He sees that they know what
he is going to say already&quot; (loud cheers), &quot;and so won't keep
them, but only ask them to treat the toast as it deserves.  It
is the head of the eleven, the head of big-side football, their
leader on this glorious day - Pater Brooke!&quot;</P>
<P>And away goes the pounding and cheering again, becoming
deafening when old Brooke gets on his legs; till, a table having
broken down, and a gallon or so of beer been upset, and all
throats getting dry, silence ensues, and the hero speaks,
leaning his hands on the table, and bending a little forwards.
No action, no tricks of oratory - plain, strong, and straight,
like his play.</P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen of the School-house!  I am very proud of the way in
which you have received my name, and I wish I could say all I
should like in return.  But I know I shan't.  However, I'll do
the best I can to say what seems to me ought to be said by a
fellow who's just going to leave, and who has spent a good slice
of his life here.  Eight years it is, and eight such years as I
can never hope to have again.  So now I hope you'll all listen
to me&quot; (loud cheers of &quot;That we will&quot;), &quot;for I'm going to talk
seriously.  You're bound to listen to me for what's the use of
calling me 'pater,' and all that, if you don't mind what I say?
And I'm going to talk seriously, because I feel so.  It's a
jolly time, too, getting to the end of the half, and a goal
kicked by us first day&quot; (tremendous applause), &quot;after one of the
hardest and fiercest day's play I can remember in eight years.&quot;
(Frantic shoutings.)  &quot;The School played splendidly, too, I will
say, and kept it up to the last.  That last charge of theirs
would have carried away a house.  I never thought to see
anything again of old Crab there, except little pieces, when I
saw him tumbled over by it.&quot;  (Laughter and shouting, and great
slapping on the back of Jones by the boys nearest him.)  &quot;Well,
but we beat 'em.&quot;  (Cheers.)  &quot;Ay, but why did we beat 'em?
Answer me that.&quot;  (Shouts of &quot;Your play.&quot;)  &quot;Nonsense!  'Twasn't
the wind and kick-off either - that wouldn't do it.  'Twasn't
because we've half a dozen of the best players in the school, as
we have.  I wouldn't change Warner, and Hedge, and Crab, and the
young un, for any six on their side.&quot;  (Violent cheers.)  &quot;But
half a dozen fellows can't keep it up for two hours against two
hundred.  Why is it, then?  I'll tell you what I think.  It's
because we've more reliance on one another, more of a house
feeling, more fellowship than the School can have.  Each of us
knows and can depend on his next-hand man better.  That's why we
beat 'em to-day.  We've union, they've division - there's the
secret.&quot;  (Cheers.)  &quot;But how's this to be kept up?  How's it to
be improved?  That's the question.  For I take it we're all in
earnest about beating the School, whatever else we care about.
I know I'd sooner win two School-house matches running than get
the Balliol scholarship any day.&quot;  (Frantic cheers.)</P>
<P>&quot;Now, I'm as proud of the house as any one.  I believe it's the
best house in the school, out and out.&quot;  (Cheers.)  &quot;But it's a
long way from what I want to see it.  First, there's a deal of
bullying going on.  I know it well.  I don't pry about and
interfere; that only makes it more underhand, and encourages the
small boys to come to us with their fingers in their eyes
telling tales, and so we should be worse off than ever.  It's
very little kindness for the sixth to meddle generally - you
youngsters mind that.  You'll be all the better football players
for learning to stand it, and to take your own parts, and fight
it through.  But depend on it, there's nothing breaks up a house
like bullying.  Bullies are cowards, and one coward makes many;
so good-bye to the School-house match if bullying gets ahead
here.&quot;  (Loud applause from the small boys, who look meaningly
at Flashman and other boys at the tables.)  &quot;Then there's
fuddling about in the public-house, and drinking bad spirits,
and punch, and such rot-gut stuff.  That won't make good drop-
kicks or chargers of you, take my word for it.  You get plenty
of good beer here, and that's enough for you; and drinking isn't
fine or manly, whatever some of you may think of it.</P>
<P>&quot;One other thing I must have a word about.  A lot of you think
and say, for I've heard you, 'There's this new Doctor hasn't
been here so long as some of us, and he's changing all the old
customs.  Rugby, and the Schoolhouse especially, are going to
the dogs.  Stand up for the good old ways, and down with the
Doctor!'  Now I'm as fond of old Rugby customs and ways as any
of you, and I've been here longer than any of you, and I'll give
you a word of advice in time, for I shouldn't like to see any of
you getting sacked.  'Down with the Doctor's' easier said than
done.  You'll find him pretty tight on his perch, I take it, and
an awkwardish customer to handle in that line.  Besides now,
what customs has he put down?  There was the good old custom of
taking the linchpins out of the farmers' and bagmen's gigs at
the fairs, and a cowardly, blackguard custom it was.  We all
know what came of it, and no wonder the Doctor objected to it.
But come now, any of you, name a custom that he has put down.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The hounds,&quot; calls out a fifth-form boy, clad in a green
cutaway with brass buttons and cord trousers, the leader of the
sporting interest, and reputed a great rider and keen hand
generally.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, we had six or seven mangy harriers and beagles belonging
to the house, I'll allow, and had had them for years, and that
the Doctor put them down.  But what good ever came of them?
Only rows with all the keepers for ten miles round; and big-side
hare-and-hounds is better fun ten times over.  What else?&quot;</P>
<P>No answer.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I won't go on.  Think it over for yourselves.  You'll
find, I believe, that he don't meddle with any one that's worth
keeping.  And mind now, I say again, look out for squalls if you
will go your own way, and that way ain't the Doctor's, for it'll
lead to grief.  You all know that I'm not the fellow to back a
master through thick and thin.  If I saw him stopping football,
or cricket, or bathing, or sparring, I'd be as ready as any
fellow to stand up about it.  But he don't; he encourages them.
Didn't you see him out to-day for half an hour watching us?&quot;
(loud cheers for the Doctor); &quot;and he's a strong, true man, and
a wise one too, and a public-school man too&quot; (cheers), &quot;and so
let's stick to him, and talk no more rot, and drink his health
as the head of the house.&quot;  (Loud cheers.)  &quot;And now I've done
blowing up, and very glad I am to have done.  But it's a solemn
thing to be thinking of leaving a place which one has lived in
and loved for eight years; and if one can say a word for the
good of the old house at such a time, why, it should be said,
whether bitter or sweet.  If I hadn't been proud of the house
and you - ay, no one knows how proud - I shouldn't be blowing
you up.  And now let's get to singing.  But before I sit down I
must give you a toast to be drunk with three-times-three and all
the honours.  It's a toast which I hope every one of us,
wherever he may go hereafter, will never fail to drink when he
thinks of the brave, bright days of his boyhood.  It's a toast
which should bind us all together, and to those who've gone
before and who'll come after us here.  It is the dear old
School-house - the best house of the best school in England!&quot;</P>
<P>My dear boys, old and young, you who have belonged, or do
belong, to other schools and other houses, don't begin throwing
my poor little book about the room, and abusing me and it, and
vowing you'll read no more when you get to this point.  I allow
you've provocation for it.  But come now - would you, any of
you, give a fig for a fellow who didn't believe in and stand up
for his own house and his own school?  You know you wouldn't.
Then don't object to me cracking up the old School house, Rugby.
Haven't I a right to do it, when I'm taking all the trouble of
writing this true history for all of your benefits?  If you
ain't satisfied, go and write the history of your own houses in
your own times, and say all you know for your own schools and
houses, provided it's true, and I'll read it without abusing
you.</P>
<P>The last few words hit the audience in their weakest place.
They had been not altogether enthusiastic at several parts of
old Brooke's speech; but &quot;the best house of the best school in
England&quot; was too much for them all, and carried even the
sporting and drinking interests off their legs into rapturous
applause, and (it is to be hoped} resolutions to lead a new life
and remember old Brooke's words - which, however, they didn't
altogether do, as will appear hereafter.</P>
<P>But it required all old Brooke's popularity to carry down parts
of his speech - especially that relating to the Doctor.  For
there are no such bigoted holders by established forms and
customs, be they never so foolish or meaningless, as English
school-boys - at least, as the school-boys of our generation.
We magnified into heroes every boy who had left, and looked upon
him with awe and reverence when he revisited the place a year or
so afterwards, on his way to or from Oxford or Cambridge; and
happy was the boy who remembered him, and sure of an audience as
he expounded what he used to do and say, though it were sad
enough stuff to make angels, not to say head-masters, weep.</P>
<P>We looked upon every trumpery little custom and habit which had
obtained in the School as though it had been a law of the Medes
and Persians, and regarded the infringement or variation of it
as a sort of sacrilege.  And the Doctor, than whom no man or boy
had a stronger liking for old school customs which were good and
sensible, had, as has already been hinted, come into most
decided collision with several which were neither the one nor
the other.  And as old Brooke had said, when he came into
collision with boys or customs, there was nothing for them but
to give in or take themselves off; because what he said had to
be done, and no mistake about it.  And this was beginning to be
pretty clearly understood.  The boys felt that there was a
strong man over them, who would have things his own way, and
hadn't yet learnt that he was a wise and loving man also.  His
personal character and influence had not had time to make itself
felt, except by a very few of the bigger boys with whom he came
more directly into contact; and he was looked upon with great
fear and dislike by the great majority even of his own house.
For he had found School and School-house in a state of monstrous
license and misrule, and was still employed in the necessary but
unpopular work of setting up order with a strong hand.</P>
<P>However, as has been said, old Brooke triumphed, and the boys
cheered him and then the Doctor.  And then more songs came, and
the healths of the other boys about to leave, who each made a
speech, one flowery, another maudlin, a third prosy, and so on,
which are not necessary to be here recorded.</P>
<P>Half-past nine struck in the middle of the performance of &quot;Auld
Lang Syne,&quot; a most obstreperous proceeding, during which there
was an immense amount of standing with one foot on the table,
knocking mugs together and shaking hands, without which
accompaniments it seems impossible for the youths of Britain to
take part in that famous old song.  The under-porter of the
School-house entered during the performance, bearing five or six
long wooden candlesticks with lighted dips in them, which he
proceeded to stick into their holes in such part of the great
tables as he could get at; and then stood outside the ring till
the end of the song, when he was hailed with shouts.</P>
<P>&quot;Bill you old muff, the half-hour hasn't struck.&quot;  &quot;Here, Bill,
drink some cocktail.&quot;  &quot;Sing us a song, old boy.&quot;  &quot;Don't you
wish you may get the table?&quot;  Bill drank the proffered cocktail
not unwillingly, and putting down the empty glass, remonstrated.
&quot;Now gentlemen, there's only ten minutes to prayers, and we must
get the hall straight.&quot;</P>
<P>Shouts of &quot;No, no!&quot; and a violent effort to strike up &quot;Billy
Taylor&quot; for the third time.  Bill looked appealingly to old
Brooke, who got up and stopped the noise.  &quot;Now then, lend a
hand, you youngsters, and get the tables back; clear away the
jugs and glasses.  Bill's right.  Open the windows, Warner.&quot;
The boy addressed, who sat by the long ropes, proceeded to pull
up the great windows, and let in a clear, fresh rush of night
air, which made the candles flicker and gutter, and the fires
roar.  The circle broke up, each collaring his own jug, glass,
and song-book; Bill pounced on the big table, and began to
rattle it away to its place outside the buttery door.  The
lower-passage boys carried off their small tables, aided by
their friends; while above all, standing on the great hall-
table, a knot of untiring sons of harmony made night doleful by
a prolonged performance of &quot;God Save the King.&quot;  His Majesty
King William the Fourth then reigned over us, a monarch
deservedly popular amongst the boys addicted to melody, to whom
he was chiefly known from the beginning of that excellent if
slightly vulgar song in which they much delighted,&mdash;</P>
<blockquote>&quot;Come, neighbours all, both great and small,<br>
Perform your duties here,<br>
And loudly sing, 'Live Billy, our king,'<br>
For bating the tax upon beer.&quot;</blockquote>
<P>Others of the more learned in songs also celebrated his praises
in a sort of ballad, which I take to have been written by some
Irish loyalist.  I have forgotten all but the chorus, which ran,&mdash;</P>
<blockquote>&quot;God save our good King William, be his name for ever blest;<br>
He's the father of all his people, and the guardian of all the
rest.&quot;</blockquote>
<P>In troth we were loyal subjects in those days, in a rough way.
I trust that our successors make as much of her present Majesty,
and, having regard to the greater refinement of the times, have
adopted or written other songs equally hearty, but more
civilized, in her honour.</P>
<P>Then the quarter to ten struck, and the prayer-bell rang.  The
sixth and fifth form boys ranged themselves in their school
order along the wall, on either side of the great fires, the
middle-fifth and upper-school boys round the long table in the
middle of the hall, and the lower-school boys round the upper
part of the second long table, which ran down the side of the
hall farthest from the fires.  Here Tom found himself at the
bottom of all, in a state of mind and body not at all fit for
prayers, as he thought; and so tried hard to make himself
serious, but couldn't, for the life of him, do anything but
repeat in his head the choruses of some of the songs, and stare
at all the boys opposite, wondering at the brilliancy of their
waistcoats, and speculating what sort of fellows they were.  The
steps of the head-porter are heard on the stairs, and a light
gleams at the door.  &quot;Hush!&quot; from the fifth-form boys who stand
there, and then in strides the Doctor, cap on head, book in one
hand, and gathering up his gown in the other.  He walks up the
middle, and takes his post by Warner, who begins calling over
the names.  The Doctor takes no notice of anything, but quietly
turns over his book and finds the place, and then stands, cap in
hand and finger in book, looking straight before his nose.  He
knows better than any one when to look, and when to see nothing.
To-night is singing night, and there's been lots of noise and no
harm done - nothing but beer drunk, and nobody the worse for it,
though some of them do look hot and excited.  So the Doctor sees
nothing, but fascinates Tom in a horrible manner as he stands
there, and reads out the psalm, in that deep, ringing, searching
voice of his.  Prayers are over, and Tom still stares open-
mouthed after the Doctor's retiring figure, when he feels a pull
at his sleeve, and turning round, sees East.</P>
<P>&quot;I say, were you ever tossed in a blanket?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; said Tom; &quot;why?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;'Cause there'll be tossing to-night, most likely, before the
sixth come up to bed.  So if you funk, you just come along and
hide, or else they'll catch you and toss you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Were you ever tossed?  Does it hurt?&quot; inquired Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh yes, bless you, a dozen times,&quot; said East, as he hobbled
along by Tom's side upstairs.  &quot;It don't hurt unless you fall on
the floor.  But most fellows don't like it.&quot;</P>
<P>They stopped at the fireplace in the top passage, where were a
crowd of small boys whispering together, and evidently unwilling
to go up into the bedrooms.  In a minute, however, a study door
opened, and a sixth-form boy came out, and off they all scuttled
up the stairs, and then noiselessly dispersed to their different
rooms.  Tom's heart beat rather quick as he and East reached
their room, but he had made up his mind.  &quot;I shan't hide, East,&quot;
said he.</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, old fellow,&quot; replied East, evidently pleased; &quot;no
more shall I.  They'll be here for us directly.&quot;</P>
<P>The room was a great big one, with a dozen beds in it, but not a
boy that Tom could see except East and himself. East pulled off
his coat and waistcoat, and then sat on the bottom of his bed
whistling and pulling off his boots.  Tom followed his example.</P>
<P>A noise and steps are heard in the passage, the door opens, and
in rush four or five great fifth-form boys, headed by Flashman
in his glory.</P>
<P>Tom and East slept in the farther corner of the room, and were
not seen at first.</P>
<P>&quot; Gone to ground, eh?&quot; roared Flashman.  &quot;Push 'em out then,
boys; look under the beds.&quot;  And he pulled up the little white
curtain of the one nearest him.  &quot;Who-o-op!&quot; he roared, pulling
away at the leg of a small boy, who held on tight to the leg of
the bed, and sang out lustily for mercy.</P>
<P>&quot;Here, lend a hand, one of you, and help me pull out this young
howling brute.  - Hold your tongue, sir, or I'll kill you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, please, Flashman, please, Walker, don't toss me!  I'll fag
for you - I'll do anything - only don't toss me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You be hanged,&quot; said Flashman, lugging the wretched boy along;
&quot;'twon't hurt you, - you ! - Come along, boys; here he is.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I say, Flashey,&quot; sang out another of the big boys; &quot;drop that;
you heard what old Pater Brooke said to-night.  I'll be hanged
if we'll toss any one against their will.  No more bullying.
Let him go, I say.&quot;</P>
<P>Flashman, with an oath and a kick, released his prey, who rushed
headlong under his bed again, for fear they should change their
minds, and crept along underneath the other beds, till he got
under that of the sixth-form boy, which he knew they daren't
disturb.</P>
<P>&quot;There's plenty of youngsters don't care about it,&quot; said Walker.
&quot;Here, here's Scud East - you'll be tossed, won't you, young
un?&quot;  Scud was East's nickname, or Black, as we called it,
gained by his fleetness of foot.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said East, &quot;if you like, only mind my foot.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And here's another who didn't hide.  - Hullo! new boy; what's
your name, sir?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Brown.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Whitey Brown, you don't mind being tossed?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; said Tom, setting his teeth.</P>
<P>&quot;Come along then, boys,&quot; sang out Walker; and away they all
went, carrying along Tom and East, to the intense relief of four
or five other small boys, who crept out from under the beds and
behind them.</P>
<P>&quot;What a trump Scud is!&quot; said one.  &quot;They won't come back here
now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And that new boy, too; he must be a good-plucked one.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! wait till he has been tossed on to the floor; see how he'll
like it then!&quot;</P>
<P>Meantime the procession went down the passage to Number 7, the
largest room, and the scene of the tossing, in the middle of
which was a great open space.  Here they joined other parties of
the bigger boys, each with a captive or two, some willing to be
tossed, some sullen, and some frightened to death.  At Walker's
suggestion all who were afraid were let off, in honour of Pater
Brooke's speech.</P>
<P>Then a dozen big boys seized hold of a blanket, dragged from one
of the beds.  &quot;In with Scud; quick! there's no time to lose.&quot;
East was chucked into the blanket.  &quot;Once, twice, thrice, and
away!&quot;  Up he went like a shuttlecock, but not quite up to the
ceiling.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, boys, with a will,&quot; cried Walker; &quot;once, twice, thrice,
and away!&quot;  This time he went clean up, and kept himself from
touching the ceiling with his hand, and so again a third time,
when he was turned out, and up went another boy.  And then came
Tom's turn.  He lay quite still, by East's advice, and didn't
dislike the &quot;once, twice, thrice;&quot; but the &quot;away&quot; wasn't so
pleasant.  They were in good wind now, and sent him slap up to
the ceiling first time, against which his knees came rather
sharply.  But the moment's pause before descending was the rub - 
the feeling of utter helplessness and of leaving his whole
inside behind him sticking to the ceiling.  Tom was very near
shouting to be set down when he found himself back in the
blanket, but thought of East, and didn't; and so took his three
tosses without a kick or a cry, and was called a young trump for
his pains.</P>
<P>He and East, having earned it, stood now looking on.  No
catastrophe happened, as all the captives were cool hands, and
didn't struggle.  This didn't suit Flashman.  What your real
bully likes in tossing is when the boys kick and struggle, or
hold on to one side of the blanket, and so get pitched bodily on
to the floor; it's no fun to him when no one is hurt or
frightened.</P>
<P>&quot;Let's toss two of them together, Walker,&quot; suggested he.</P>
<P>&quot;What a cursed bully you are, Flashey!&quot; rejoined the other.  &quot;Up
with another one.&quot;</P>
<P>And so now two boys were tossed together, the peculiar hardship
of which is, that it's too much for human nature to lie still
then and share troubles; and so the wretched pair of small boys
struggle in the air which shall fall a-top in the descent, to
the no small risk of both falling out of the blanket, and the
huge delight of brutes like Flashman.</P>
<P>But now there's a cry that the prepostor of the room is coming;
so the tossing stops, and all scatter to their different rooms;
and Tom is left to turn in, with the first day's experience of a
public school to meditate upon.</P>
