<p>Brinton Kingsland was in the saddle again on the instant, and
his pony dashed down the arroya at full speed.</p>

<p>"Wolf Ear has hurried back to tell the rest that he has seen
us, and they will be here in a few minutes," was the belief that
lent wings to his speed.</p>

<p>It was a comparatively short ride to where his friends awaited
him. A minute sufficed for them to learn the alarming tidings.</p>

<p>"It won't do to delay another second; come on!"</p>

<p>The next moment the two horses followed the youth out of the
gully upon the plain.</p>

<p>"Can you stand it, father?" he asked, holding his pony back and
looking inquiringly at him.</p>

<p>"Yes, my son; don't think of me," was the brave response, as
the parent struck his animal into a gallop.</p>

<p>The mother was a capital horsewoman, and little Edith, who was
now fully awake, once more accommodated herself to her position,
so as to save all embarrassment so far as she was concerned.</p>

<p>Child-like, she wanted to ask innumerable questions, but she
was intelligent enough to understand that silence was expected
of her, and she held her peace, wondering, perplexed, and frightened.</p>

<p>The wintry afternoon was wearing to a close.  The sky maintained
its heavy leaden hue, the wind blew fitfully and was of piercing
keenness, and the occasional snow-flakes, whirling about the heads
of the fugitives, were more like hailstones than the soft downy
particles which had appeared earlier in the afternoon.  The view
was shortened in the gathering gloom, and the anxious eyes glancing
around the different points of the compass, and especially to
the rear, failed to reveal the dreaded horsemen from whom they
were fleeing.</p>

<p>The hope of the little party lay in keeping beyond sight of their
enemies until night.  With no moon and stars to guide them, the
hostiles could not keep their trail, which our friends were sure
to make as winding as possible.</p>

<p>As the night approached, their hopes increased.  Darkness was
closing in when they reached the bank of the Big Cheyenne, and,
for the first time since leaving the arroya, they drew rein.</p>

<p>"This is better than I dared expect," said the father in high
spirits, and seemingly strengthened by his sharp ride through
the cutting cold; "I can hardly understand it."</p>

<p>"I suspect that Wolf Ear made a blunder."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"He did not think we should leave the gully before night; he
went back and told the rest.  They dared not attack us where we
had some show to defend ourselves; they will not discover our
flight until it is too late."</p>

<p>While there seemed reason in this belief, it did not fully satisfy
the father.  It was not in keeping with the subtlety of the American
Indian that they should allow a party of whites to ride directly
away from them, when they were at their mercy.  Any one of the
hostiles, by climbing the side of the arroya, was sure to see
the little company of fugitives emerge therefrom, and it was inconceivable
that they should not take that simple precaution.</p>

<p>"There is something beyond all this which has not yet appeared,"
he said; "neither Wolf Ear nor his companions are fools."</p>

<p>The river swept by in the gathering darkness at their feet. 
The current was not swift, but pieces of ice lay against the shores,
and floated past in the middle of the stream.  The opposite bank
could hardly be seen in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Must we cross that?" asked Mrs. Kingsland, as the horses halted
on the margin of the icy waters.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied her husband, "and twenty miles further we must
cross the White, to say nothing of smaller streams, which may
be as deep and more difficult.  Pine Ridge lies fifty miles away,
and there's no going round any of the water."</p>

<p>"It will be the death of us to swim our horses," she said with
a shudder; "we shall freeze to death."</p>

<p>"That is not to be thought of," Brinton hastened to explain;
"while the Cheyenne has many deep places at this season, there
are others where a horse can wade across without wetting one's
stirrups."</p>

<p>"But how are we to know such fords?"</p>

<p>"By trying, and there's no better place than this; wait till
I make the attempt."</p>

<p>With commendable promptness he urged Jack forward, and the animal,
understanding what was required of him, stepped among the pieces
of ice along the bank.  He slipped on one, and Edith uttered a
cry of alarm.</p>

<p>"Look out, Brint!  You will fall into the water."</p>

<p>"Don't fret about me," he called back.</p>

<p>A few reassuring words to his pony, who hesitated and sniffed,
as if about to draw back, and he continued his cautious advance
into the stream, the others anxiously watching his progress.</p>

<p>Should the water prove deep enough to force the steed to swim,
it would never do, for that would necessitate the saturation of
the garments of all, which meant freezing to death.</p>

<p>As long as the ponies maintained a sure footing, even though
the water crept well up their sides, the riders could guard themselves
against the dreaded wetting.  Brinton, therefore, ventured into
the stream with the utmost care, his animal feeling every step
of the way.  Ten steps from the bank, and the water touched Brinton's
stirrups.  He withdrew his feet and held them out of reach.  He
was so excellent a horseman that, by the pressure of his knees,
he sat almost as firmly in the saddle as if with the support for
his feet.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Jack; slowly&mdash;slowly&mdash;slowly!"</p>

<p>Jack was sniffing, with his neck outstretched and his nose almost
on the surface of the water, The breath issued like steam through
his thin silken nostrils, and he paid no heed to a triangular
piece of jagged ice which struck his hind legs with a sharp thrust,
and then swung clear.  He knew his duty, and was doing his "level
best."</p>

<p>The rider turned his head and looked back.  The forms of his
parents on their motionless horses were dim, and growing more
indistinct in the approaching night.</p>

<p>Seeing him turn his head, his father called something in a guarded
undertone, which the son did not catch, but, believing it was
simply a request for him to be careful, he replied, "All right,"
and went on with the work in hand.</p>

<p>Several steps further and the water had not perceptibly deepened.
Brinton, indeed, was inclined to think it had slightly shallowed.</p>

<p>"We are pretty near the middle, and it begins to look as if I
had struck the right spot after all Halloa! what's up now?"</p>

<p>Jack had stopped, just as he did in the arroya, and with the
same appearance of alarm.</p>

<p>"Can it be that you have scented a deep place in front and want
to save me from a bath?"</p>

<p>Brinton Kingsland checked the light question on his lips, for
at the moment of uttering it his own vision answered the query
in a manner that fairly lifted his cap from his head.</p>

<p>A horseman was advancing through the water from the other side
of the Cheyenne.  He was several rods away, but near enough for
the youth to recognise him as an Indian warrior.  He had entered
the icy stream, as if to meet the other, who in the same glance
that identified him dimly discerned more horsemen on the bank
beyond.</p>

<p>As in the former instance, Jack had discovered the peril before
his master and halted, not through fear of a chilling bath, but
because of a tenfold greater danger stealing upon them.</p>

<p>It looked as if the hostiles, from whom they were fleeing, had
come towards the river from beyond, and were again between them
and safety.</p>

<p>If so, the question might well be asked what was meant by this
extraordinary behaviour of the red men?  Why did they not conceal
themselves until the fugitives rode directly into their arms? 
Why take this risk of sending one of their number to meet an enemy
in mid-stream, where, despite whatever advantage the savage possessed,
he could not help yielding a portion of it to his foe?</p>

<p>But it was a moment for action and not for conjecture and speculation.</p>

<p>In the same moment that Brinton recognised the horseman immediately
in his front as a foe, he observed that his pony had also halted
and the rider was in the act of bringing his weapon to his shoulder.</p>

<p>The mitten was snatched from the youth's right hand and thrust
in the pocket of his coat.  He had no time to slip the other off,
nor was it necessary, since that only supported the rifle.  He
hastily brought his Winchester to a level, and, knowing that everything
depended upon who was the quicker, he took instant aim at the
centre of the dark figure and let fly.</p>

<p>With a wild cry the Indian rolled from his pony, and disappeared
in the dark waters.  His animal, with a snort of alarm, whirled
about and dashed to shore, sending the spray flying in all directions.</p>

<p>"Quick, Jack! back with you!"</p>

<p>Brinton flung himself on the neck of his pony, who seemed to
spin about on his hind feet as he galloped furiously through the
water for the shore he had just left.  Nothing but this precaution
and the deepening gloom saved the daring youth from death.  It
required a few precious seconds for the hostiles on the other
bank to comprehend what had taken place, and when they began firing
the form of the horse and his rider were fast vanishing from sight.</p>

<p>But the bullets were whistling perilously near his friends, who
did not quite comprehend what had taken place.</p>

<p>"Move further down the bank!" called Brinton in a guarded undertone;
"quick! don't stop to ask why, but do as I say!"</p>

<p>The parents obeyed, and a minute or two was sufficient to take
them out of range.</p>

<p>"Follow them, Jack, and move lively!"</p>

<p>The pony obeyed, and he too passed beyond danger for the time.</p>

<p>The darkness was too deep for the persons on either bank to discern
the others across the stream.  The hostiles kept up their firing,
in a blind way, hoping that some of their shots might reach the
fugitives.  Brinton had lain down on the shore, so as to decrease
the danger of being struck by any of the stray bullets.  He could
tell where the others were by the flash of their guns, but deemed
it best not to fire for the present, through fear of betraying
his own position.</p>

<p>The dropping shots continued for a few minutes, and then suddenly
stopped.  It was impossible to tell in the gloom what his enemies
were doing, but he suspected the truth: they were preparing to
ford the river, with a view of bringing the combatants to close
quarters.</p>

<p>Peering intently into the night, he made out the faint outline
of a horseman feeling his way across, and did not doubt that others
were close behind him.  This must be a particularly favourable
ford, else the hostiles would try some other, if they knew of
any in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>It was necessary to check this advance, if he expected to save
the dear ones with him.  The moment, therefore, he made sure of
the object approaching, he sighted as best he could and blazed
away, instantly shifting his own position, to escape the return
shot which he knew would be quick in coming.</p>

<p>It was well he did so, for the flash and report of several rifles
and the whistling of the bullets told of the peril escaped by
a very narrow chance.</p>

<p>There was no reason to believe that his own shot had been fatal,
for there was no outcry, nor did the listening ear detect any
splash in the water, such as marked his first essays when in mid-stream;
but he had accomplished that which he sought&mdash;he had checked the
advance, which otherwise must have been fatal to him and his companions. 
The form of the horseman disappeared in the gloom.  He had returned
to the shore whence he came, and it was safe to conclude that
he would not soon repeat the attempt.</p>

<p>"What will be their next step?" was the question that presented
itself to the young defender of the ford.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that they would try to cross in the
face of the certain reception that awaited them.</p>

<p>"They know more of the Cheyenne than we do," Brinton Kingsland
thought, "and must be aware of some place where they can reach
this side without danger.  If they do succeed in coming over,
there will be trouble."</p>

<p>He dared not wait long, for nothing was to be gained, while he
ran the risk of losing everything.  Only the sound of the rushing
water, the crunching of the ice, reached his ear.  Rising to his
feet and peering into the gloom, he could discern nothing of his
foes.</p>

<p>"There's no need of my staying here," he decided, starting along
the stream in quest of his parents.</p>

<p>When he had passed a hundred yards without seeing them, he was
astonished.  Another hundred, and still they were invisible, and
the cautious signals he made remained unanswered.</p>
