<p>"Oh, look, Allee! See the elephants and lions and giraffes and
zebras on that poster. It's the cirkis as sure as I'm alive! Do
you know I've always wanted to see the cirkis, and this is the
first time I ever knew one to stop at Parker."</p>

<p>"How do you know it will stop here?" asked skeptical Allee, who
was just beginning to read, and found the long words on the billboard
too much for her to master.</p>

<p>"'Cause it says so. Parker, the eighteenth, Allee. Just think,
that's only next Saturday! Just a week from today! Isn't it lucky
it's on Saturday? Do you s'pose we can go?"</p>

<p>"I 'xpect it will take money for that just like it does for everything
else," answered the blue-eyed baby with a comically philosophical
air; "and you know Gail never has any for such things as that."</p>

<p>"Well, this is cheaper than most things, 'cause it says 'a-dults
twenty-five cents, and children fifteen cents.' The Fair cost
half a dollar for a-dults and twenty-five cents for children.
If there is a chance to go to anything cheap, we better try hard
to go, Allee, for that doesn't happen often."</p>

<p>"Maybe Gail might not like to have us go even if we could get
the money."</p>

<p>"She does have some queer notions about places, doesn't she?
At first she didn't want us to see that moving picture show at
the church, but when Brother Strong went and took us, she thought
it was all right. We'll ask about the cirkis before we tell her
that it's coming, and maybe we can find out that way whether she
would let us go."</p>

<p>"I don't think we would have to ask much, 'cause she thinks cirkises
are bad, and I don't b'lieve she would like to have us there."</p>

<p>"What makes you so sure? I never have heard her say a thing about
them."</p>

<p>"She told Hope so the time Hope wanted to see '<em>Julio and
Romiet</em>' when they studied it in school."</p>

<p>"That wasn't a cirkis, that was a theatre, Allee. That's different.
It takes painted people to play out the words in the theatre,
but at the cirkis only real animals act, and do tricks that take
brains to learn. Why, this picture shows a nelephant beating a
drum. Now, elephants live in the <em>jumbles</em> of Africa, Hope
says, and they don't have drums to beat there. Hunters go to their
houses and catch them and teach them how to drum, 'cause they
have brains enough to learn. Look at that lion with its mouth
open and that woman with her head chucked clear inside. She must
like to be licked better'n I do. It makes me shiver when Towzer
sticks his big, hot tongue on my face. Ugh! S'posing the lion
should shut his mouth and bite her head off, what do you guess
she'd do?"</p>

<p>"I guess they'd have to get another woman for the lion," answered
Allee. "I don't b'lieve those animals really do those things,
do you, Peace?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. Why, that book of natural history that Hector lent
us after he got licked for stealing the melons tells about the
way hunters train them to act in cirkises. I'd like to see them
awfully much myself."</p>

<p>"Then let's ask Gail. She <em>might</em> have a little spare
money."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think she would. We'll have to earn the money ourselves,
but I'm afraid she won't want us to go. That's what is bothering
me. I tell you what let's do. We'll earn the money first and buy
our tickets, and then I'm sure she will let us go. Shall we?"</p>

<p>"Maybe that would be the best way. But how'll we earn the money?
It's only a week from now, you said yourself, and that won't leave
us much time to do anything, 'specially as school keeps 'most
all day long. There ain't any strawberries to pick or blackberries
to sell or snow to sweep or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let's give a nentertaimnent in our barn like Hec and the boys
did last week in their carriage-shed. They charged a cent apiece,
and earned more'n a quarter, Hec told me. And I know we could
give a better entertainment than they did. You could sing and
Cherry could speak. Perhaps we could coax Hope to read to us.
She does it splendidly, though usu'ly she thinks she's too big
to play with us any longer. I am pretty sure Hec would turn summersets
for us. He has been quite respectable since that last licking
the Judge gave him. Jimmy Jones would likely play the bones for
us, too, if Hec asked him to. They don't make a pretty noise,
but it's a sight to see his hands fly. Tessie is learning the
fiddle and I know she'd be glad to show off, and so would Effie,
if we could get our organ out into the barn."</p>

<p>"And you can whistle," put in Allee, all excitement as Peace
unfolded her brilliant plan. "You sound just like the birds, and
Gail said only the other night that you did better than lots of
people who have taken lessons. But do you s'pose she will let
us have the organ? Do you s'pose she'll even let us have the barn?
It is in an awful clutter, and I don't see where we could put
the people who come."</p>

<p>"I was wondering about that myself, but it won't do any harm
to ask. There is Hec. We can find out from him right away if he
will be one of our show."</p>

<p>"Shall you tell him about the cirkis?"</p>

<p>"No, not a word. We'll have that as just a secret among our two
selves until we see how much money we can earn. See?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Don't you tell a soul!"</p>

<p>"Of course I won't!"</p>

<p>"Hector, wait a minute! We want to see you. Say, will you be
in a nentertainment me and Allee are getting up in our barn?"</p>

<p>The boy looked somewhat surprised at this request, for Peace
had been very slow in accepting his friendly advances, though
he had showered her with every possible attention ever since the
day of the double tragedy in their breakfast room, owing to certain
forceful remarks made by his irate parent. Here was an opportunity
not to be disregarded, but with a great show of indifference,
he leisurely faced the two conspirators, and lazily drawled out,
"What kind of an entertainment?"</p>

<p>"One to make a little money," Peace answered briefly.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I need it," was the very satisfactory reply.</p>

<p>"How much do you expect to make?"</p>

<p>"You said you got more'n a quarter, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yep. Twenty-eight cents."</p>

<p>"Then I think we ought to get more'n fifty cents, 'cause we mean
to have a <em>good</em> program."</p>

<p>Hector felt as if a dash of cold water had suddenly struck his
face, but he was quite accustomed to Peace's characteristics by
this time, so did not resent her implied doubtful compliment,
but asked, with somewhat more of interest in his manner, "Who's
going to be in it?"</p>

<p>"Tessie and Effie and Cherry and Allee&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Peace is to whistle," put in the small cherub with sisterly
loyalty.</p>

<p>"Aw, a girls' crowd! There ain't any boys in it."</p>

<p>"You'll make one if you will turn summersets. And we thought
you might get Jimmie to play the bones for us, and p'r'aps Lute
Dunbar might bring over his accordian. I b'lieve Mike O'Hara would
speak that Irish piece of his that makes folks laugh so much,
and maybe we could get the minister to stand on his head. He does
that elegant. Whenever I visit there, that's the first thing I
ask him for, and he nearly always does it, too."</p>

<p>"Whoop-ee!" shouted Hector, turning a handspring. "I know a <em>boy</em>
that stands on his head, and he will do it any time I ask him
to. Mr. Strong prob'ly wouldn't in front of a big crowd like you'd
have in your barn. The Sherrars are coming down from Martindale
Monday to stay a whole week with us, and Victor plays the cornet
to beat the band. He's a little bigger'n us, but he will do anything
for Cecile, and I'll get her to ask him. What'll you do for chairs
at your place?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Peace confessed. "Maybe Gail won't even let us
have the barn, but I think she will. We must give it this week,
before next Saturday, I mean, 'cause that's the time we have to
have the money&mdash;" She stopped abruptly, fearing that he would
guess her secret, but he showed no trace of suspicion, so with
freer breath she continued, "I'm going home now and see Gail.
I think Wednesday or Thursday after school would be the best time,
don't you? Then if it should rain, we would still have another
day left before Saturday. It won't take us long to get ready,
seeing we each do our part all alone."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Hector, with unusual readiness, "I think Wednesday
will be all right, and I'll get up the tickets for you."</p>

<p>"Goody! You might get them ready while I go see Gail. I'll be
right back."</p>

<p>She and Allee disappeared up the road in a cloud of dust and
Hector repaired to his home to manufacture the bits of cardboard
necessary for admission to the wonderful entertainment. It was
an hour later that Peace appeared at the Judge's door and asked
to see the young gentleman of the house, but it required no words
from her to tell him that her errand had been fruitless.</p>

<p>"She won't let you give the entertainment!" he said, the instant
he saw her woe-begone face.</p>

<p>"She doesn't care about the entertainment at all, but she won't
let us have the barn, and here I've been and asked Effie and Tessie
and Mike, and they all promised to take part. Oh, dear! I did
want that money so bad!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure Gail won't care if you give the entertainment?"
Hector stood in considerable awe of the big girls at the little
brown house, and he wanted to run no risks in the daring plan
his own brain had suddenly evolved.</p>

<p>"No, she doesn't care a single speck. She said we could give
it in the orchard, but then anyone could come and look on without
having to pay a cent, and I can't get my money at all."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can. We will give the entertainment in our carriage-shed
if you'll divide the money with me, Peace. Course if I furnish
the building I've a right to <em>part</em> of the money."</p>

<p>"But half is quite a lot," demanded the girl with some hesitation.
"See, I've <em>got</em> to make at least thirty cents for Allee
and me, and I wanted fifteen cents more for Cherry."</p>

<p>"We could have Cecile's old organ in the shed," said Hector,
ignoring her objections for the moment; "and there is a big lantern
hanging from the roof, so we could light it if it got dark before
we were through. We had better light it anyway, I guess, and draw
the curtains so no one outside can see. Then everyone who wants
to hear the program will <em>have</em> to buy a ticket. If we
get up such a swell entertainment, Peace, it is worth more'n a
cent. Let's charge two for a nickel; then if we can get fifty
people to come it will give us each quite a neat little pile out
of it. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't&mdash;think&mdash;many folks would buy at such a high
price," said Peace, doubtfully, though the picture he drew was
very alluring.</p>

<p>"Why, of course they will for such a bang-up program as we'll
give them. Mamma and Cecile and Mrs. Sherrar and Frances will
go; and Nancy and Marie, the girls. That makes six right there.
Of course we can't charge Victor anything if he takes part. I
bet Miss Truesdale would buy a ticket, too. You ask her, or get
Allee to. Allee is in her room now. The minister and his family
are coming over some night for dinner while the Sherrars are here,
and I'll get mamma to invite them Wednesday, and you tell them
to come early enough for the program. They'll be glad to. Mr.
Strong was here the day we boys had our time in the carriage shed,
and he clapped and stamped the loudest of anyone."</p>

<p>"Have you written the tickets yet?"</p>

<p>"No, just cut them."</p>

<p>"Well, that's good. We'll charge a nickel for two tickets, and
give it in your shed next Wednesday. Get to work now. I've just
thought of Montie Fry and his trick dog, and Dick Sullivan and
his mouth-organ. I am going right over and see if they will take
part."</p>

<p>She was as good as her word, and when the following Wednesday
afternoon arrived it would have been hard to tell which was the
largest, the audience in the carriage shed, or the company of
participants arranged on the platform which Leonard had built
for just such gatherings; but every one of the fifty tickets had
been sold, and late arrivals had to present cash, at the door,
where Hector presided.</p>

<p>The program, was certainly original and varied, if somewhat lengthy,
and the audience was kept in a thrill of expectation from one
number to the next, for Peace was a master hand at arranging her
numbers, and instinctively had saved the best for the last. Just
as she herself had taken her place in front of the motley gathering
to give an exhibition of her whistling, the big door swung noiselessly,
and the company from the great house arrived in a body,&mdash;the Judge's
wife and daughter, their guests, the Sherrars, and the minister
and his small family. They looked very much surprised to find
the place crowded to its utmost capacity, but were even more astonished
when, after a preliminary bar or so on the mouth-organ, Dick Sullivan
began softly to play <em>The Blue-bells of Scotland</em>, and
Peace's red lips took up the melody, whistling with beautiful
accuracy and clearness, trilling through measure after measure
with bird-like notes, following all of Dick's variations, and
adding a few of her own under the inspiration lent by the presence
of her beloved friends.</p>

<p>"Cecile," exclaimed her friend Frances, "why didn't you tell
me you had such a genius in your midst? I'd have been out here
the first one to hear the whole program. Why, she looks like an
angel, and her whistling is divine. Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Peace Greenfield," answered Cecile, almost too amazed for speech,
for this was the first time she herself had ever heard the young
whistler. "Father calls her the dearest little nuisance in town.
She is one of the most original pieces I ever saw in my life&mdash;always
into mischief, and always trying to help someone. But truly, I
had no idea she could whistle like that. Mr. Strong, what do you
think of it?"</p>

<p>"She is doing splendidly!" he whispered enthusiastically. "She
is a regular genius at it. Why, a year ago she came to me and
begged <em>me</em> to teach her."</p>

<p>"So she is a pupil of yours?" asked Mrs. Sherrar, as much enchanted
with the musician as were her young people.</p>

<p>"Not exactly. I helped her what I could, but I think most of
the credit belongs to Mike O'Hara and the birds in the woods.
He set her to imitating them; and she is an apt mimic, you will
find. Clap with all your might."</p>

<p>The very rafters rang with the applause of the enthusiastic audience,
as the small whistler took her seat among her mates on the platform,
and she was forced to give another selection, and a third. Allee
came to her aid in the fourth, and sang to a whistled accompaniment,
but the applause was more tremendous and insistent than before;
and poor, weary Peace rose to her feet for the fifth time, but
instead of pouring forth the torrent of melody they expected,
she faced the audience belligerently, and cried in exasperation,
"My pucker is tired out and my throat aches. Do you 'xpect me
to stand here all night? Victor Sherrar will play on his cornet
now and then you can go home."</p>

<p>"Mamma," whispered Frances, while her brother was rendering the
closing number of the program, "I simply must have those two tots
at my party next week. They will be a novelty and everyone is
sure to like them. Cecile thinks I can borrow them all right,
seeing that it is to be Saturday night."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see," smiled the mother indulgently, as the crowd
broke up and departed, while Peace and Hector divided the spoils
in the corner. "She surely is an interesting specimen, and it
was worth ten times the money just to hear her squelch her audience.
Where is Brother Strong?"</p>

<p>He was interviewing the brown-eyed girl, who, with her money
in hand, was about ready to follow her companions for home; and
they clustered around the little group by Hector's table just
in time to hear Peace's dismayed voice cry, "You're fooling! I
didn't believe that of <em>you</em>. Why, Mr. Strong, I read it
myself on the poster!"</p>

<p>"Where? What poster?"</p>

<p>"That big one up on the corner back of this house. Allee and
me were picking gentians when we saw it. Didn't we, Allee?"</p>

<p>"But, Peace, that was last year's sign. There hasn't been a circus
in town this summer, and there isn't going to be. It is past circus
time."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" she faltered, opening her fist and looking tragically
at the pile of nickels and dimes she held.</p>

<p>"Perfectly sure! They were to have been here last year just about
this time, but it rained pitchforks, as you children say, and
they didn't stop. That poster is ragged and faded with time. If
you don't believe me, just come up to the corner and I'll show
you the date."</p>

<p>"Oh, I b'lieve you! Ministers don't often tell lies; but I was
just thinking of this heap of money I've earned all for nothing.
Eighty cents was my share, and I thought that would take most
of our family&mdash;s'posing Gail would let us go."</p>

<p>The amused grown-ups smiled behind her back, but the preacher
understood how disappointed she was, and taking her hand sympathetically
in his, he drew her aside and whispered a few words in her ear
which brought back the sparkle to her eyes and the happy glow
to her face, as she exclaimed enthusiastically, "I'll do it! Sure!
No, I won't tell a soul. Course Gail will let me. All right! Good-bye!"</p>

<p>She was off like a shot down the road, and the pastor joined
his hostess on the way to the house, with the irrelevant remark,
"Dr. David Peak, a missionary to Africa, is to speak at our Sunday
morning service. I hope we have a large attendance, as this will
be a rare treat. It isn't often a little country church can secure
so notable a speaker. Spread the good news all you can."</p>

<p>Something in his voice made the Judge's wife say suggestively,
"He is not to be the only unusual attraction, is he?"</p>

<p>"The only one to be advertised," smiled the parson, and she understood.</p>

<p>The following Sabbath day was glorious, bright, warm, and with
the smell of fall in the air. The church was packed; pastor and
people were at their best; and an expectant hush fell over the
little audience when Mr. Strong took his seat after reading the
weekly announcements. The organ began to play softly, necks were
craned to catch a glimpse of the singer, and then a buzz of surprise
filled the room. Peace, dressed all in white, and looking like
a rosy cherub, had mounted to the organ loft where Faith was playing,
and at the proper moment, she began to whistle a beautiful bird
melody which surprised even those who had heard her the previous
Wednesday. The whole audience sat spellbound. It seemed incredible
that Peace,&mdash;little, blundering Peace, riotous, rebellious, happy-go-lucky
Peace&mdash;had such a soul of melody bottled up within her. It was
as if the songsters from the forest were suddenly let loose, and
even her own sisters were amazed at her song.</p>

<p>Mr. Strong had been wise when he chose that moment for Peace's
music, for the whole congregation was in tune for the grand missionary
plea which followed, when Dr. Peak rose to address them; and so
inspired, and uplifted was the speaker himself that he preached
as he never had done before, bringing his cause so close to the
people that they were thrilled and fired with his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Parker was a well-to-do little village, built originally for
the express purpose of permitting wealthy business men of the
city to find peaceful retreat from the noisy metropolis, where,
week in and week out, they spent the long days of labor. It had
now somewhat outgrown this reputation, but still numbered many
rich men among its inhabitants, and boasted of an unusually fine
church for such a small place, although it was not noted for its
spiritual zeal, and particularly was it lacking in its missionary
spirit. These were difficulties which the ardent young preacher,
Mr. Strong, had sought for many long months to overcome, and while
the earnest missionary from Africa was pleading the cause of the
heathen, the pastor praying with all his might for his own congregation.</p>

<p>When the wonderful sermon was finished, and Mr. Strong saw the
unusual interest in the faces before him, he determined to strike
while the iron was hot, and though that Sunday was not scheduled
for a missionary collection, he sprang to his feet and made an
urgent plea for more funds for the grand and glorious cause.</p>

<p>"Give from the depths of your heart," he urged. "Think of these
millions of people needing the Gospel. Brother Peak has come direct
from the field, he knows conditions better than anyone else can
know them. He tells us they need more missionaries. How are they
to get them? Through us in our civilized countries. We can't all
go in person, but I don't think there is a soul here this morning
but can give something to help a little. The ushers will now wait
upon you. Who will be the first to give, and what shall it be,&mdash;yourself,
time, m&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My cirkis money!" cried a shrill voice from the organ loft,
and there stood Peace, fishing coin after coin from the depths
of her pocket and dropping them over the pulpit into the missionary's
outstretched hand. "I earned it so's me and Allee and Cherry could
go to the cirkis&mdash;that is, if Gail would let us&mdash;and then, come
to find out, it was last summer, and on 'count of the rain it
never stopped at all. Next best to seeing the cirkis is hearing
what that man said about the little black babies in Africa,&mdash;that's
where the cirkis animals come from, too,&mdash;and I couldn't help
wondering how I'd feel s'posing I had to live there and be black
and eat such horrible things and be boiled in a kettle to take
the dirt off, and buy my wife for a junk of cloth and wear strings
of beads for clo'es. Here's my eighty cents, Dr. Missionary, to
buy them a little more Gospel, and when I'm grown up if there
are still heathen living in that country, I b'lieve I'll come
down and help."</p>

<p>Whether it was the missionary's sermon, Mr. Strong's plea, or
Peace's postscript that did the work, perhaps no one will ever
know, but when the ushers brought their loaded baskets to the
pulpit and the extraordinary collection was counted, it was found
that over one hundred dollars had been raised for the missionary
cause that morning in the Parker Church.</p>
