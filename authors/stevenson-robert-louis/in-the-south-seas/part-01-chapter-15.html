<p>It had chanced (as the <u>Casco</u> beat through the Bordelais Straits for
Taahauku) she approached on one board very near the land in the opposite
isle of Tauata, where houses were to be seen in a grove of tall
coco-palms.  Brother Michel pointed out the spot.  ‘I am at home now,’
said he.  ‘I believe I have a large share in these cocoa-nuts; and in
that house madame my mother lives with her two husbands!’  ‘With two
husbands?’ somebody inquired.  ‘<u>C’est ma honte</u>,’ replied the brother
drily.
</p>
<p>A word in passing on the two husbands.  I conceive the brother to have
expressed himself loosely.  It seems common enough to find a native lady
with two consorts; but these are not two husbands.  The first is still
the husband; the wife continues to be referred to by his name; and the
position of the coadjutor, or <u>pikio</u>, although quite regular, appears
undoubtedly subordinate.  We had opportunities to observe one household
of the sort.  The <u>pikio</u> was recognised; appeared openly along with the
husband when the lady was thought to be insulted, and the pair made
common cause like brothers.  At home the inequality was more apparent.
The husband sat to receive and entertain visitors; the <u>pikio</u> was
running the while to fetch cocoa-nuts like a hired servant, and I
remarked he was sent on these errands in preference even to the son.
Plainly we have here no second husband; plainly we have the tolerated
lover.  Only, in the Marquesas, instead of carrying his lady’s fan and
mantle, he must turn his hand to do the husband’s housework.
</p><p>The sight of Brother Michel’s family estate led the conversation for some
while upon the method and consequence of artificial kinship.  Our
curiosity became extremely whetted; the brother offered to have the whole
of us adopted, and some two days later we became accordingly the children
of Paaaeua, appointed chief of Atuona.  I was unable to be present at the
ceremony, which was primitively simple.  The two Mrs. Stevensons and Mr.
Osbourne, along with Paaaeua, his wife, and an adopted child of theirs,
son of a shipwrecked Austrian, sat down to an excellent island meal, of
which the principal and the only necessary dish was pig.  A concourse
watched them through the apertures of the house; but none, not even
Brother Michel, might partake; for the meal was sacramental, and either
creative or declaratory of the new relationship.  In Tahiti things are
not so strictly ordered; when Ori and I ‘made brothers,’ both our
families sat with us at table, yet only he and I, who had eaten with
intention were supposed to be affected by the ceremony.  For the adoption
of an infant I believe no formality to be required; the child is handed
over by the natural parents, and grows up to inherit the estates of the
adoptive.  Presents are doubtless exchanged, as at all junctures of
island life, social or international; but I never heard of any
banquet—the child’s presence at the daily board perhaps sufficing.  We
may find the rationale in the ancient Arabian idea that a common diet
makes a common blood, with its derivative axiom that ‘he is the father
who gives the child its morning draught.’  In the Marquesan practice, the
sense would thus be evanescent; from the Tahitian, a mere survival, it
will have entirely fled.  An interesting parallel will probably occur to
many of my readers.
</p><p>What is the nature of the obligation assumed at such a festival?  It will
vary with the characters of those engaged, and with the circumstances of
the case.  Thus it would be absurd to take too seriously our adoption at
Atuona.  On the part of Paaaeua it was an affair of social ambition; when
he agreed to receive us in his family the man had not so much as seen us,
and knew only that we were inestimably rich and travelled in a floating
palace.  We, upon our side, ate of his baked meats with no true <u>animus
affiliandi</u>, but moved by the single sentiment of curiosity.  The affair
was formal, and a matter of parade, as when in Europe sovereigns call
each other cousin.  Yet, had we stayed at Atuona, Paaaeua would have held
himself bound to establish us upon his land, and to set apart young men
for our service, and trees for our support.  I have mentioned the
Austrian.  He sailed in one of two sister ships, which left the Clyde in
coal; both rounded the Horn, and both, at several hundred miles of
distance, though close on the same point of time, took fire at sea on the
Pacific.  One was destroyed; the derelict iron frame of the second, after
long, aimless cruising, was at length recovered, refitted, and hails
to-day from San Francisco.  A boat’s crew from one of these disasters
reached, after great hardships, the isle of Hiva-oa.  Some of these men
vowed they would never again confront the chances of the sea; but alone
of them all the Austrian has been exactly true to his engagement, remains
where he landed, and designs to die where he has lived.  Now, with such a
man, falling and taking root among islanders, the processes described may
be compared to a gardener’s graft.  He passes bodily into the native
stock; ceases wholly to be alien; has entered the commune of the blood,
shares the prosperity and consideration of his new family, and is
expected to impart with the same generosity the fruits of his European
skill and knowledge.  It is this implied engagement that so frequently
offends the ingrafted white.  To snatch an immediate advantage—to get
(let us say) a station for his store—he will play upon the native custom
and become a son or a brother for the day, promising himself to cast down
the ladder by which he shall have ascended, and repudiate the kinship so
soon as it shall grow burdensome.  And he finds there are two parties to
the bargain.  Perhaps his Polynesian relative is simple, and conceived
the blood-bond literally; perhaps he is shrewd, and himself entered the
covenant with a view to gain.  And either way the store is ravaged, the
house littered with lazy natives; and the richer the man grows, the more
numerous, the more idle, and the more affectionate he finds his native
relatives.  Most men thus circumstanced contrive to buy or brutally
manage to enforce their independence; but many vegetate without hope,
strangled by parasites.
</p><p>We had no cause to blush with Brother Michel.  Our new parents were kind,
gentle, well-mannered, and generous in gifts; the wife was a most
motherly woman, the husband a man who stood justly high with his
employers.  Enough has been said to show why Moipu should be deposed; and
in Paaaeua the French had found a reputable substitute.  He went always
scrupulously dressed, and looked the picture of propriety, like a dark,
handsome, stupid, and probably religious young man hot from a European
funeral.  In character he seemed the ideal of what is known as the good
citizen.  He wore gravity like an ornament.  None could more nicely
represent the desired character as an appointed chief, the outpost of
civilisation and reform.  And yet, were the French to go and native
manners to revive, fancy beholds him crowned with old men’s beards and
crowding with the first to a man-eating festival.  But I must not seem to
be unjust to Paaaeua.  His respectability went deeper than the skin; his
sense of the becoming sometimes nerved him for unexpected rigours.
</p><p>One evening Captain Otis and Mr. Osbourne were on shore in the village.
All was agog; dancing had begun; it was plain it was to be a night of
festival, and our adventurers were overjoyed at their good fortune.  A
strong fall of rain drove them for shelter to the house of Paaaeua, where
they were made welcome, wiled into a chamber, and shut in.  Presently the
rain took off, the fun was to begin in earnest, and the young bloods of
Atuona came round the house and called to my fellow-travellers through
the interstices of the wall.  Late into the night the calls were
continued and resumed, and sometimes mingled with taunts; late into the
night the prisoners, tantalised by the noises of the festival, renewed
their efforts to escape.  But all was vain; right across the door lay
that god-fearing householder, Paaaeua, feigning sleep; and my friends had
to forego their junketing.  In this incident, so delightfully European,
we thought we could detect three strands of sentiment.  In the first
place, Paaaeua had a charge of souls: these were young men, and he judged
it right to withhold them from the primrose path.  Secondly, he was a
public character, and it was not fitting that his guests should
countenance a festival of which he disapproved.  So might some strict
clergyman at home address a worldly visitor: ‘Go to the theatre if you
like, but, by your leave, not from my house!’  Thirdly, Paaaeua was a man
jealous, and with some cause (as shall be shown) for jealousy; and the
feasters were the satellites of his immediate rival, Moipu.
</p><p>For the adoption had caused much excitement in the village; it made the
strangers popular.  Paaaeua, in his difficult posture of appointed chief,
drew strength and dignity from their alliance, and only Moipu and his
followers were malcontent.  For some reason nobody (except myself)
appears to dislike Moipu.  Captain Hart, who has been robbed and
threatened by him; Father Orens, whom he has fired at, and repeatedly
driven to the woods; my own family, and even the French officials—all
seemed smitten with an irrepressible affection for the man.  His fall had
been made soft; his son, upon his death, was to succeed Paaaeua in the
chieftaincy; and he lived, at the time of our visit, in the shoreward
part of the village in a good house, and with a strong following of young
men, his late braves and pot-hunters.  In this society, the coming of the
<u>Casco</u>, the adoption, the return feast on board, and the presents
exchanged between the whites and their new parents, were doubtless
eagerly and bitterly canvassed.  It was felt that a few years ago the
honours would have gone elsewhere.  In this unwonted business, in this
reception of some hitherto undreamed-of and outlandish potentate—some
Prester John or old Assaracus—a few years back it would have been the
part of Moipu to play the hero and the host, and his young men would have
accompanied and adorned the various celebrations as the acknowledged
leaders of society.  And now, by a malign vicissitude of fortune, Moipu
must sit in his house quite unobserved; and his young men could but look
in at the door while their rivals feasted.  Perhaps M. Grévy felt a touch
of bitterness towards his successor when he beheld him figure on the
broad stage of the centenary of eighty-nine; the visit of the <u>Casco</u>
which Moipu had missed by so few years was a more unusual occasion in
Atuona than a centenary in France; and the dethroned chief determined to
reassert himself in the public eye.
</p><p>Mr. Osbourne had gone into Atuona photographing; the population of the
village had gathered together for the occasion on the place before the
church, and Paaaeua, highly delighted with this new appearance of his
family, played the master of ceremonies.  The church had been taken, with
its jolly architect before the door; the nuns with their pupils; sundry
damsels in the ancient and singularly unbecoming robes of tapa; and
Father Orens in the midst of a group of his parishioners.  I know not
what else was in hand, when the photographer became aware of a sensation
in the crowd, and, looking around, beheld a very noble figure of a man
appear upon the margin of a thicket and stroll nonchalantly near.  The
nonchalance was visibly affected; it was plain he came there to arouse
attention, and his success was instant.  He was introduced; he was civil,
he was obliging, he was always ineffably superior and certain of himself;
a well-graced actor.  It was presently suggested that he should appear in
his war costume; he gracefully consented; and returned in that strange,
inappropriate and ill-omened array (which very well became his handsome
person) to strut in a circle of admirers, and be thenceforth the centre
of photography.  Thus had Moipu effected his introduction, as by
accident, to the white strangers, made it a favour to display his finery,
and reduced his rival to a secondary <u>rôle</u> on the theatre of the
disputed village.  Paaaeua felt the blow; and, with a spirit which we
never dreamed he could possess, asserted his priority.  It was found
impossible that day to get a photograph of Moipu alone; for whenever he
stood up before the camera his successor placed himself unbidden by his
side, and gently but firmly held to his position.  The portraits of the
pair, Jacob and Esau, standing shoulder to shoulder, one in his careful
European dress, one in his barbaric trappings, figure the past and
present of their island.  A graveyard with its humble crosses would be
the aptest symbol of the future.
</p><p>We are all impressed with the belief that Moipu had planned his campaign
from the beginning to the end.  It is certain that he lost no time in
pushing his advantage.  Mr. Osbourne was inveigled to his house; various
gifts were fished out of an old sea-chest; Father Orens was called into
service as interpreter, and Moipu formally proposed to ‘make brothers’
with Mata-Galahi—Glass-Eyes,—the not very euphonious name under which Mr.
Osbourne passed in the Marquesas.  The feast of brotherhood took place on
board the <u>Casco</u>.  Paaaeua had arrived with his family, like a plain
man; and his presents, which had been numerous, had followed one another,
at intervals through several days.  Moipu, as if to mark at every point
the opposition, came with a certain feudal pomp, attended by retainers
bearing gifts of all descriptions, from plumes of old men’s beard to
little, pious, Catholic engravings.
</p><p>I had met the man before this in the village, and detested him on sight;
there was something indescribably raffish in his looks and ways that
raised my gorge; and when man-eating was referred to, and he laughed a
low, cruel laugh, part boastful, part bashful, like one reminded of some
dashing peccadillo, my repugnance was mingled with nausea.  This is no
very human attitude, nor one at all becoming in a traveller.  And, seen
more privately, the man improved.  Something negroid in character and
face was still displeasing; but his ugly mouth became attractive when he
smiled, his figure and bearing were certainly noble, and his eyes superb.
In his appreciation of jams and pickles, in is delight in the
reverberating mirrors of the dining cabin, and consequent endless
repetition of Moipus and Mata-Galahis, he showed himself engagingly a
child.  And yet I am not sure; and what seemed childishness may have been
rather courtly art.  His manners struck me as beyond the mark; they were
refined and caressing to the point of grossness, and when I think of the
serene absent-mindedness with which he first strolled in upon our party,
and then recall him running on hands and knees along the cabin sofas,
pawing the velvet, dipping into the beds, and bleating commendatory
‘<u>mitais</u>’ with exaggerated emphasis, like some enormous over-mannered
ape, I feel the more sure that both must have been calculated.  And I
sometimes wonder next, if Moipu were quite alone in this polite
duplicity, and ask myself whether the <u>Casco</u> were quite so much admired
in the Marquesas as our visitors desired us to suppose.
</p><p>I will complete this sketch of an incurable cannibal grandee with two
incongruous traits.  His favourite morsel was the human hand, of which he
speaks to-day with an ill-favoured lustfulness.  And when he said
good-bye to Mrs. Stevenson, holding her hand, viewing her with tearful
eyes, and chanting his farewell improvisation in the falsetto of
Marquesan high society, he wrote upon her mind a sentimental impression
which I try in vain to share.
