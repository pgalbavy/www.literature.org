<p>By this time the sun had reached the rim of the horizon, and
the shadows were deepening under the trees. Deerfoot dropped further
behind the Sauk and Pawnee, the three still pushing westward,
which was opposite the course that would have been taken to reach
the camp-fire. The highly trained senses of the young Shawanoe
could hear and see nothing to show that his enemies were near
at hand.</p>

<p>Every minute now lessened the danger, for only a little more
obscurity was required to prevent the keenest eyes of an American
Indian from detecting the footprints in the forest. He concluded
that, from some cause or other, the Pawnees had given over the
pursuit.</p>

<p>So soon as Deerfoot was convinced on this point, he hastened
to overtake Hay-uta, who was walking almost on the heels of the
captive. The latter was not lacking in a certain dignity. He did
not shamble along, as though his courage had been driven from
his body. He walked erect, with head high, scarcely deigning to
bend it to avoid an occasional interfering limb. He preferred
to flank rather than stoop to such an obstruction. His carriage
was so proud indeed that it looked as if he were a conqueror,
with his two slaves walking behind him. Not once did he look about,
or act as though he suspected the presence of friend or foe.</p>

<p>This curious procession lasted until the three were nearly a
half mile from camp. By that time, night was closing in, and the
gloom was such that Deerfoot was persuaded he need give no further
thought to the Pawnee war party.</p>

<p>Hay-uta had acted the part of conductor, without much thought
as to the course they were taking. Swerving to the right, they
were soon beyond sight of the open space, and for a while the
march was through the trackless forest; but, while the red men
deviated very little from the path, the river, like all streams,
took a winding course, and, just at the moment that Deerfoot joined
the Sauk, the three debouched from the woods and (inasmuch as
the open space had dwindled to a mere ribbon) found themselves
close to the edge of the stream. There of necessity they halted.</p>

<p>The Pawnee now glanced over his shoulder and stopped, as if waiting
for some command. Receiving none he started along the stream,
but was checked by a word from Deerfoot, whose gesture explained
what he meant. The warrior paused, and folding his arms confronted
them with the same calm defiance as before.</p>

<p>There was something in his demeanor that compelled the admiration
of his captors. It proved that whatever the Pawnee might be, he
was not a coward, and it recalled to the young Shawanoe, the days
when he wandered through the forests and cane brakes of Kentucky,
like a raging cat o' mountain in his hatred of the pale-faces.
There were depths in the nature of the youth which were rarely
sounded; but now and then he caught glimpses of the possibilities
within himself which caused him to shrink back, as if from the
presence of a supernaturally evil being.</p>

<p>For the last part of the march the same thought occupied the
minds of both Deerfoot and Hay-uta: in what manner could they
win the friendship of the captive, and thus open the way to a
solution of the mystery respecting Otto Relstaub?</p>

<p>Now that the journey was over for the present, the captors consulted
together. When Deerfoot called on Hay-uta for the method that
had presented itself to him, the Sauk replied that the only thing
of which he could think was to make the Pawnee believe that he
had but a few moments to live that there was no possible escape;
and then, when that view was impressed on the prisoner, they would
present him with his liberty.</p>

<p>Such was the plan also of Deerfoot, but when Hay-uta proposed
that the Pawnee should be soused into the water and held under
the surface until on the point of drowning, the Shawanoe shook
his head.</p>

<p>Deerfoot showed a far-seeing mind in the course which he adopted,
and to which Hay-uta assented without fathoming its full purpose.
The youth felt that the circumstances were such that it was more
important for the Sauk to figure as a merciful captor than for
himself to play that part.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, it may be said, had proved his ability to take care
of himself, where it was possible for a human being to do so.
The Sauk was skillful, but in the perilous times close at hand,
he was likely to stand in greater need of a friend "at court"
than was the Shawanoe. It was this motive which actuated the latter
in what he now did.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will make ready to slay the Pawnee," said he, "and
then Hay-uta will stay his hand."</p>

<p>The Sauk nodded to signify he understood the arrangement.</p>

<p>"Let my brother wait till all is ready; let him stand still till
the Pawnee has no hope: when Deerfoot raises his tomahawk, then
shall my brother forbid."</p>

<p>There was something touching in the dignity of the Pawnee, when
he felt that no hope remained to him. He had no blanket, and all
his weapons had been removed. He stood perhaps twenty feet, or
slightly less, from Deerfoot, in plain sight, though the twilight
had given place to that of the moon, which was partly full and
shining from a sky in which were a number of drifting clouds.
He was only a step or two from the woods, which it would seem
offered a temptation too great to be resisted.</p>

<p>Doubtless some such thought entered his mind, but the Shawanoe
never turned his face, and maintained such unremitting watch,
that the captive must have felt he was shut in on every side.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had laid aside his bow and rifle and grasped his tomahawk&mdash;that
weapon which in his hands was as unerring for a short distance
as was the arrow from his bow. On the first motion of his captive
toward flight, no matter how quickly made, the tomahawk would
split the skull as if it were a rotten apple.</p>

<p>The Pawnee made no such attempt. He remained with his fine figure
drawn to its full height. The weight of his body supported mainly
on his right foot, while the left rested lightly a few inches
in front, the posture similar to that which a trained athlete
would assume when about to leap over a slight obstruction.</p>

<p>His arms were folded across his chest, his shoulders thrown back,
while his eyes were fixed on the face of his captor a short distance
away. Once or twice they flitted to the gloomy woods on his left,
as though a faint hope fluttered in his heart that his friends
would rush to his relief; but he knew that if such a thing were
possible, it would have been done long before. Night and darkness
had shut out all help from them.</p>

<p>The words between Deerfoot and Hay-uta were few, for the arrangements
were so simple that many were not required. Hay-uta stepped back,
and Deerfoot gathered himself like a marksman about to fire at
a target.</p>

<p>The slightest incident did not escape the Pawnee. He saw that
his last minute was at hand. Without changing his posture or unfolding
his arms, he leaned forward and bowed his head, so that the crown
was presented to his master, and his eyes, had they been open,
would have looked directly on the ground. But they were closed,
and his attitude was that of the devout worshipers in the congregation
who, having risen to their feet and joined in the singing, bow
their heads while the minister pronounces his benison.</p>

<p>The feet of Deerfoot were placed similarly to those of his victim,
and his tomahawk was held idly in his left hand, the blade pressing
the side of his knee. When necessary it would be raised over and
back of his shoulder like a flash of light, and sent crashing
into the brain of his victim.</p>

<p>The stillness became more impressive from a sound which blended
with, rather than broke into it; a low monotone, like the sweeping
of the wind over the strings of some rude instrument of music,
issued from the lips of the Pawnee. It became broken, but at no
time lost its distinctive character. It never rose to a high key,
and from the beginning to the end, its variation in tone was no
more than two notes of the musical scale. Had the volume been
less, it would have called to mind the crooning of the housewife
by her spinning wheel or over the cradle of the infant she was
lulling to sleep.</p>

<p>But there was a depth, and a certain sonorous resignation in
the death-song of the Pawnee, which rendered it unlike any thing
else. The Shawanoe and Sauk had heard it sung more than once,
and, accustomed as they were to the most dreadful scenes, they
were always relieved when it ended; it was too much like a despairing
refrain from the grave itself.</p>

<p>Gradually the volume of the Pawnee's death song deepened. For
a time it was as if the voice were swaying from side to side in
the struggle to free itself from some weight holding it down and
smothering it. The weight was flung off, when, throwing up his
head again, the Pawnee defiantly confronted the Shawanoe. The
unspeakably dismal monotone sounded loud and clear as a trumpet
blast borne on the wind, which, having blown at angles to the
line of sound, suddenly becomes favorable, and throws the notes
forward as if on eagles' wings.</p>

<p>The death song was ended; the Pawnee had finished his preparation
for the leap into the dark, and he calmly awaited the pleasure
of his master.</p>

<p>Instead of whirling his tomahawk aloft, Deerfoot slowly brought
it above his head, the blade making a gleaming circle, as it swung
over and finally paused, the handle so held that it pointed upward
and backward, at an angle of forty-five degrees. He seemed to
be gathering his muscles for the supreme effort, which should
extinguish life in the defiant Pawnee as quickly as if he were
smitten by a bolt from heaven. But, before the missile could leave
his hand, the Sauk uttered an exclamation, and, having laid aside
his gun, strode forward with both hands raised in protest.</p>

<p>His first two steps were rapid, and then, making a great bound,
he seized the left arm of Deerfoot with both of his hands. The
Shawanoe seemed to struggle fiercely to free himself, and his
voice sounded harsh and angry as he ordered the other to step
aside and leave him alone. But the Sauk, with no abatement of
earnestness, refused, and, for a second or two, the contest was
so desperate that the wonder was the prisoner did not make a break
for life. Possibly he did not understand the nature of the struggle
until it was over, or it may have been that, having made his preparations
for death, he was loth to change the programme.</p>

<p>But the dispute ended as quickly as it began. The Sauk triumphed,
as, judging from the size of the two, he was likely to do in such
a wrangle. The hand of Deerfoot became nerveless and dropped to
his side. He stood silent and sullen, as though he had no more
interest in the matter.</p>

<p>Using mild language again, the Pawnee was surprised when the
Sauk walked forward, and handed back the rifle, which Deerfoot
had taken from him a short time before. The prisoner hesitated
a moment as if in doubt, but the manner of Hay-uta was too plain
to be mistaken. He accepted the weapon, giving utterance to what
was probably meant as an expression of thanks.</p>

<p>Returning a few steps, the Sauk picked up the tomahawk and knife
from the ground, and advancing once more in front of the Pawnee,
presented them to him with the grace of the Crusader. His pleasure
in giving was surely equal to that of the Pawnee in receiving
them.</p>

<p>All this time Deerfoot remained like a statue of sullenness,
glowering on the two, as though he would have been pleased to
tomahawk both actors in the singular drama.</p>

<p>The Pawnee was quick to catch the purport of his friend in need.
He shoved the blade of his knife into the skin-sheath at his girdle;
he thrust the handle of his tomahawk through the same support,
but further to one side, as if to balance the other weapon. Then
he grasped his gun near the flint, and was ready for the next
step in the proceedings.</p>

<p>Placing his hand on the prisoner's shoulder, Hay-uta turned him
partly around, so that he faced up stream and in the direction
of the camp, where so many of his friends were gathered. Pushing
him gently forward, he exclaimed in an undertone and in his own
language:</p>

<p>"<em>Go!</em>"</p>

<p>The Pawnee obeyed, the same dignity marking his movement as when
he stood in the presence of death. He strode forward until he
reached the darkness of the wood, into which he seemed to blend
as if a part of the gloom itself.</p>

<p>When within the shelter, however, he laid aside his courtliness,
as it may be called, and used the utmost haste in placing himself
beyond danger.</p>

<p>Having played a part so long, he seemed to "go all to pieces",
and dashed under the limbs and among the trunks like a terrified
deer.</p>

<p>This panic, however, was soon over, and he came to an abrupt
stop when only a short distance away. Standing a second or two,
as if in deep thought, he turned, and began stealing toward the
narrow open space where he had stood a few minutes before, with
bowed head, while he chanted his death song. His movement was
noiseless, and he speedily peered from among the trees upon the
forms of the Shawanoe and Sauk, who were in the act of moving
off. They were in plain sight, and the swarthy countenance gleamed,
as, carefully muffling the sound of the hammer, he drew it back
and brought the rifle to his shoulder.</p>

<p>The distance was short and he could not mistake his aim. Though
his life had just been spared by the couple, he fairly held his
breath in his eagerness to take their lives. Could he have done
so, he would have waited till they were in range, in order that
he might bring both low.</p>

<p>But only a moment elapsed, after raising his rifle, when he pressed
the trigger.</p>

<p>The dull click of the flint was followed by a whirring flash,
as the powder vanished in a white puff, but there was no report.
Deerfoot, while carrying the weapon, had quietly withdrawn the
charge, leaving the priming, however, in the pan. He knew just
how far it is safe to trust the average American Indian.</p>
