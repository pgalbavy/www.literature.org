There was nothing to drink on the Sophie Sutherland, and we had
fifty-one days of glorious sailing, taking the southern passage in
the north-east trades to Bonin Islands.  This isolated group,
belonging to Japan, had been selected as the rendezvous of the
Canadian and American sealing fleets.  Here they filled their
water-barrels and made repairs before starting on the hundred
days' harrying of the seal-herd along the northern coasts of Japan
to Behring Sea.
<P>
Those fifty-one days of fine sailing and intense sobriety had put
me in splendid fettle.  The alcohol had been worked out of my
system, and from the moment the voyage began I had not known the
desire for a drink.  I doubt if I even thought once about a drink. 
Often, of course, the talk in the forecastle turned on drink, and
the men told of their more exciting or humorous drunks,
remembering such passages more keenly, with greater delight, than
all the other passages of their adventurous lives.
<P>
In the forecastle, the oldest man, fat and fifty, was Louis.  He
was a broken skipper.  John Barleycorn had thrown him, and he was
winding up his career where he had begun it, in the forecastle. 
His case made quite an impression on me.  John Barleycorn did
other things beside kill a man.  He hadn't killed Louis.  He had
done much worse.  He had robbed him of power and place and
comfort, crucified his pride, and condemned him to the hardship of
the common sailor that would last as long as his healthy breath
lasted, which promised to be for a long time.
<P>
We completed our run across the Pacific, lifted the volcanic
peaks, jungle-clad, of the Bonin Islands, sailed in among the
reefs to the land-locked harbour, and let our anchor rumble down
where lay a score or more of sea-gypsies like ourselves.  The
scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land. 
Aborigines, in queer outrigger canoes, and Japanese, in queerer
sampans, paddled about the bay and came aboard.  It was my first
foreign land; I had won to the other side of the world, and I
would see all I had read in the books come true.  I was wild to
get ashore.
<P>
Victor and Axel, a Swede and a Norwegian, and I planned to keep
together.  (And so well did we, that for the rest of the cruise we
were known as the "Three Sports.") Victor pointed out a pathway
that disappeared up a wild canyon, emerged on a steep bare lava
slope, and thereafter appeared and disappeared, ever climbing,
among the palms and flowers.  We would go over that path, he said,
and we agreed, and we would see beautiful scenery, and strange
native villages, and find, Heaven alone knew, what adventure at
the end.  And Axel was keen to go fishing.  The three of us agreed
to that, too.  We would get a sampan, and a couple of Japanese
fishermen who knew the fishing grounds, and we would have great
sport.  As for me, I was keen for anything.
<P>
And then, our plans made, we rowed ashore over the banks of living
coral and pulled our boat up the white beach of coral sand.  We
walked across the fringe of beach under the cocoanut-palms and
into the little town, and found several hundred riotous seamen
from all the world, drinking prodigiously, singing prodigiously,
dancing prodigiously--and all on the main street to the scandal of
a helpless handful of Japanese police.
<P>
Victor and Axel said that we'd have a drink before we started on
our long walk.  Could I decline to drink with these two chesty
shipmates? Drinking together, glass in hand, put the seal on
comradeship.  It was the way of life.  Our teetotaler owner-
captain was laughed at, and sneered at, by all of us because of
his teetotalism.  I didn't in the least want a drink, but I did
want to be a good fellow and a good comrade.  Nor did Louis' case
deter me, as I poured the biting, scorching stuff down my throat. 
John Barleycorn had thrown Louis to a nasty fall, but I was young. 
My blood ran full and red; I had a constitution of iron; and--
well, youth ever grins scornfully at the wreckage of age.
<P>
Queer, fierce, alcoholic stuff it was that we drank.  There was no
telling where or how it had been manufactured--some native
concoction most likely.  But it was hot as fire, pale as water,
and quick as death with its kick.  It had been filled into empty
"square-face" bottles which had once contained Holland gin, and
which still bore the fitting legend "Anchor Brand." It certainly
anchored us.  We never got out of the town.  We never went fishing
in the sampan.  And though we were there ten days, we never trod
that wild path along the lava cliffs and among the flowers.
<P>
We met old acquaintances from other schooners, fellows we had met
in the saloons of San Francisco before we sailed.  And each
meeting meant a drink; and there was much to talk about; and more
drinks; and songs to be sung; and pranks and antics to be
performed, until the maggots of imagination began to crawl, and it 
all seemed great and wonderful to me, these lusty hard-bitten sea-
rovers, of whom I made one, gathered in wassail on a coral strand. 
Old lines about knights at table in the great banquet halls, and
of those above the salt and below the salt, and of Vikings
feasting fresh from sea and ripe for battle, came to me; and I
knew that the old times were not dead and that we belonged to that
selfsame ancient breed.
<P>
By mid-afternoon Victor went mad with drink, and wanted to fight
everybody and everything.  I have since seen lunatics in the
violent wards of asylums that seemed to behave in no wise
different from Victor's way, save that perhaps he was more
violent.  Axel and I interfered as peacemakers, were roughed and
jostled in the mix-ups, and finally, with infinite precaution and
intoxicated cunning, succeeded in inveigling our chum down to the
boat and in rowing him aboard our schooner.
<P>
But no sooner did Victor's feet touch the deck than he began to
clean up the ship.  He had the strength of several men, and he ran
amuck with it.  I remember especially one man whom he got into the
chain-boxes but failed to damage through inability to hit him. 
The man dodged and ducked, and Victor broke all the knuckles of
both his fists against the huge links of the anchor chain.  By the
time we dragged him out of that, his madness had shifted to the
belief that he was a great swimmer, and the next moment he was
overboard and demonstrating his ability by floundering like a sick
porpoise and swallowing much salt water.
<P>
We rescued him, and by the time we got him below, undressed, and
into his bunk, we were wrecks ourselves.  But Axel and I wanted to
see more of shore, and away we went, leaving Victor snoring.  It
was curious, the judgment passed on Victor by his shipmates,
drinkers themselves.  They shook their heads disapprovingly and
muttered: "A man like that oughtn't to drink." Now Victor was the
smartest sailor and best-tempered shipmate in the forecastle.  He
was an all-round splendid type of seaman; his mates recognised his
worth, and respected him and liked him.  Yet John Barleycorn
metamorphosed him into a violent lunatic.  And that was the very
point these drinkers made.  They knew that drink--and drink with a
sailor is always excessive--made them mad, but only mildly mad. 
Violent madness was objectionable because it spoiled the fun of
others and often culminated in tragedy.  From their standpoint,
mild madness was all right.  But from the standpoint of the whole
human race, is not all madness objectionable? And is there a
greater maker of madness of all sorts than John Barleycorn?
<P>
But to return.  Ashore, snugly ensconced in a Japanese house of
entertainment, Axel and I compared bruises, and over a comfortable
drink talked of the afternoon's happenings.  We liked the
quietness of that drink and took another.  A shipmate dropped in,
several shipmates dropped in, and we had more quiet drinks. 
Finally, just as we had engaged a Japanese orchestra, and as the
first strains of the samisens and taikos were rising, through the
paper-walls came a wild howl from the street.  We recognised it. 
Still howling, disdaining doorways, with blood-shot eyes and
wildly waving muscular arms, Victor burst upon us through the
fragile walls.  The old amuck rage was on him, and he wanted
blood, anybody's blood.  The orchestra fled; so did we.  We went
through doorways, and we went through paper-walls--anything to get
away.
<P>
And after the place was half wrecked, and we had agreed to pay the
damage, leaving Victor partly subdued and showing symptoms of
lapsing into a comatose state, Axel and I wandered away in quest
of a quieter drinking-place.  The main street was a madness. 
Hundreds of sailors rollicked up and down.  Because the chief of
police with his small force was helpless, the governor of the
colony had issued orders to the captains to have all their men on
board by sunset.
<P>
What! To be treated in such fashion! As the news spread among the
schooners, they were emptied.  Everybody came ashore.  Men who had
had no intention of coming ashore climbed into the boats.  The
unfortunate governor's ukase had precipitated a general debauch
for all hands.  It was hours after sunset, and the men wanted to
see anybody try to put them on board.  They went around inviting
the authorities to try to put them on board.  In front of the
governor's house they were gathered thickest, bawling sea-songs,
circulating square faces, and dancing uproarious Virginia reels
and old-country dances.  The police, including the reserves, stood
in little forlorn groups, waiting for the command the governor was
too wise to issue.  And I thought this saturnalia was great.  It
was like the old days of the Spanish Main come back.  It was
license; it was adventure.  And I was part of it, a chesty sea-
rover along with all these other chesty sea-rovers among the paper
houses of Japan.
<P>
The governor never issued the order to clear the streets, and Axel
and I wandered on from drink to drink.  After a time, in some of
the antics, getting hazy myself, I lost him.  I drifted along,
making new acquaintances, downing more drinks, getting hazier and
hazier.  I remember, somewhere, sitting in a circle with Japanese
fishermen, Kanaka boat-steerers from our own vessels, and a young
Danish sailor fresh from cowboying in the Argentine and with a
penchant for native customs and ceremonials.  And with due and
proper and most intricate Japanese ceremonial we of the circle
drank saki, pale, mild, and lukewarm, from tiny porcelain bowls.
<P>
And, later, I remember the runaway apprentices--boys of eighteen
and twenty, of middle class English families, who had jumped their
ships and apprenticeships in various ports of the world and
drifted into the forecastles of the sealing schooners.  They were
healthy, smooth-skinned, clear-eyed, and they were young--youths
like me, learning the way of their feet in the world of men.  And
they WERE men.  No mild saki for them, but square faces illicitly
refilled with corrosive fire that flamed through their veins and
burst into conflagrations in their heads.  I remember a melting
song they sang, the refrain of which was:
<P>
<P>
   "'Tis but a little golden ring,
      I give it to thee with pride,
    Wear it for your mother's sake
      When you are on the tide."
<P>
<P>
They wept over it as they sang it, the graceless young scamps who
had all broken their mothers' prides, and I sang with them, and
wept with them, and luxuriated in the pathos and the tragedy of
it, and struggled to make glimmering inebriated generalisations on
life and romance.  And one last picture I have, standing out very
clear and bright in the midst of vagueness before and blackness
afterward.  We--the apprentices and I--are swaying and clinging to
one another under the stars.  We are singing a rollicking sea
song, all save one who sits on the ground and weeps; and we are
marking the rhythm with waving square faces.  From up and down the
street come far choruses of sea-voices similarly singing, and life
is great, and beautiful and romantic, and magnificently mad.
<P>
And next, after the blackness, I open my eyes in the early dawn to
see a Japanese woman, solicitously anxious, bending over me.  She
is the port pilot's wife and I am lying in her doorway.  I am
chilled and shivering, sick with the after-sickness of debauch. 
And I feel lightly clad.  Those rascals of runaway apprentices!
They have acquired the habit of running away.  They have run away
with my possessions.  My watch is gone.  My few dollars are gone. 
My coat is gone.  So is my belt.  And yes, my shoes.
<P>
And the foregoing is a sample of the ten days I spent in the Bonin
Islands.  Victor got over his lunacy, rejoined Axel and me, and
after that we caroused somewhat more discreetly.  And we never
climbed that lava path among the flowers.  The town and the square
faces were all we saw.
<P>
One who has been burned by fire must preach about the fire.  I
might have seen and healthily enjoyed a whole lot more of the
Bonin Islands, if I had done what I ought to have done.  But, as I
see it, it is not a matter of what one ought to do, or ought not
to do.  It is what one DOES do.  That is the everlasting,
irrefragable fact.  I did just what I did.  I did what all those
men did in the Bonin Islands.  I did what millions of men over the
world were doing at that particular point in time.  I did it
because the way led to it, because I was only a human boy, a
creature of my environment, and neither an anaemic nor a god.  I
was just human, and I was taking the path in the world that men
took--men whom I admired, if you please; full-blooded men, lusty,
breedy, chesty men, free spirits and anything but niggards in the
way they foamed life away.
<P>
And the way was open.  It was like an uncovered well in a yard
where children play.  It is small use to tell the brave little
boys toddling their way along into knowledge of life that they
mustn't play near the uncovered well.  They'll play near it.  Any
parent knows that.  And we know that a certain percentage of them,
the livest and most daring, will fall into the well.  The thing to
do--we all know it--is to cover up the well.  The case is the same
with John Barleycorn.  All the no-saying and no-preaching in the
world will fail to keep men, and youths growing into manhood, away
from John Barleycorn when John Barleycorn is everywhere
accessible, and where John Barleycorn is everywhere the
connotation of manliness, and daring, and great-spiritedness.
<P>
The only rational thing for the twentieth-century folk to do is to
cover up the well; to make the twentieth century in truth the
twentieth century, and to relegate to the nineteenth century and
all the preceding centuries the things of those centuries, the
witch-burnings, the intolerances, the fetiches, and, not least
among such barbarisms.  John Barleycorn.
