<p>His Excellency Sir Charles Greville, K. C M. G., Governor of the
Windless Islands, stood upon the veranda of Government House surveying
the new day with critical and searching eyes. Sir Charles had been
so long absolute monarch of the Windless Isles that he had assumed
unconsciously a mental attitude of suzerainty over even the glittering
waters of the Caribbean Sea, and the coral reefs under the waters,
and the rainbow skies that floated above them. But on this particular
morning not even the critical eye of the Governor could distinguish a
single flaw in the tropical landscape before him.
</p><p>The lawn at his feet ran down to meet the dazzling waters of the bay,
the blue waters of the bay ran to meet a great stretch of absinthe
green, the green joined a fairy sky of pink and gold and saffron.
Islands of coral floated on the sea of absinthe, and derelict clouds of
mother-of-pearl swung low above them, starting from nowhere and going
nowhere, but drifting beautifully, like giant soap-bubbles of light and
color. Where the lawn touched the waters of the bay the cocoanut-palms
reached their crooked lengths far up into the sunshine, and as the
sea-breeze stirred their fronds they filled the hot air with whispers
and murmurs like the fluttering of many fans. Nature smiled boldly upon
the Governor, confident in her bountiful beauty, as though she said,
“Surely you cannot but be pleased with me to-day.” And, as though in
answer, the critical and searching glance of Sir Charles relaxed.
</p><p>The crunching of the gravel and the rattle of the sentry’s musket at
salute recalled him to his high office and to the duties of the morning.
He waved his hand, and, as though it were a wand, the sentry moved
again, making his way to the kitchen-garden, and so around Government
House and back to the lawn-tennis court, maintaining in his solitary
pilgrimage the dignity of her Majesty’s representative, as well as her
Majesty’s power over the Windless Isles.
</p><p>The Governor smiled slightly, with the ease of mind of one who finds
all things good. Supreme authority, surroundings of endless beauty, the
respectful, even humble, deference of his inferiors, and never even an
occasional visit from a superior, had in four years lowered him into a
bed of ease and self-satisfaction. He was cut off from the world, and
yet of it. Each month there came, via Jamaica, the three weeks’ old copy
of The Weekly Times; he subscribed to Mudie’s Colonial Library; and
from the States he had imported an American lawn-mower, the mechanism of
which no one as yet understood. Within his own borders he had created
a healthy, orderly seaport out of what had been a sink of fever and a
refuge for all the ne’er-do-wells and fugitive revolutionists of Central
America.
</p><p>He knew, as he sat each evening on his veranda, looking across the
bay, that in the world beyond the pink and gold sunset men were still
panting, struggling, and starving; crises were rising and passing;
strikes and panics, wars and the rumors of wars, swept from continent to
continent; a plague crept through India; a filibuster with five hundred
men at his back crossed an imaginary line and stirred the world from
Cape Town to London; Emperors were crowned; the good Queen celebrated
the longest reign; and a captain of artillery imprisoned in a swampy
island in the South Atlantic caused two hemispheres to clamor for
his rescue, and lit a race war that stretched from Algiers to the
boulevards.
</p><p>And yet, at the Windless Isles, all these happenings seemed to Sir
Charles like the morning’s memory of a dream. For these things never
crossed the ring of the coral reefs; he saw them only as pictures in an
illustrated paper a month old. And he was pleased to find that this
was so. He was sufficient to himself, with his own responsibilities and
social duties and public works.
</p><p>He was a man in authority, who said to others, “Come!” and “Go!” Under
him were commissioners, and under the commissioners district inspectors
and boards of education and of highways. For the better health of the
colony he had planted trees that sucked the malaria from the air;
for its better morals he had substituted as a Sunday amusement
cricket-matches for cock-fights; and to keep it at peace he had created
a local constabulary of native negroes, and had dressed them in the
cast-off uniforms of London policemen. His handiwork was everywhere,
and his interest was all sunk in his handiwork. The days passed gorgeous
with sunshine, the nights breathed with beauty. It was an existence
of leisurely occupation, and one that promised no change, and he was
content.
</p><p>As it was Thursday, the Council met that morning, and some questions
of moment to the colony were to be brought up for consideration.
The question of the dog-tax was one which perplexed Sir Charles most
particularly. The two Councillors elected by the people and the three
appointed by the crown had disagreed as to this tax. Of the five hundred
British subjects at the seaport, all but ten were owners of dogs, and it
had occurred to Sassoon, the chemist, that a tax of half-a-crown a
year on each of these dogs would meet the expense of extending the
oyster-shell road to the new cricket-grounds. To this Snellgrove, who
held the contract for the narrow-gauge railroad, agreed; but the three
crown Councillors opposed the tax vigorously, on the ground that as
scavengers alone the dogs were a boon to the colony and should be
encouraged. The fact that each of these gentlemen owned not only one,
but several dogs of high pedigree made their position one of great
delicacy.
</p><p>There was no way by which the Governor could test the popular will
in the matter, except through his secretary, Mr. Clarges, who, at the
cricket-match between the local eleven and the officers and crew of
H. M. S. Partridge, had been informed by the other owners of several
fox-terriers that, in their opinion, the tax was a piece of “condemned
tommy-rot.” From this the Governor judged that it would not prove a
popular measure. As he paced the veranda, drawing deliberately on his
cigar, and considering to which party he should give the weight of
his final support, his thoughts were disturbed by the approach of a
stranger, who advanced along the gravel walk, guarded on either side
by one of the local constabulary. The stranger was young and of poor
appearance. His bare feet were bound in a pair of the rope sandals worn
by the natives, his clothing was of torn and soiled drill, and he fanned
his face nonchalantly with a sombrero of battered and shapeless felt.
</p><p>Sir Charles halted in his walk, and holding his cigar behind his back,
addressed himself to the sergeant.
</p><p>“A vagrant?” he asked.
</p><p>The words seemed to bear some amusing significance to the stranger, for
his face lit instantly with a sweet and charming smile, and while he
turned to hear the sergeant’s reply, he regarded him with a kindly and
affectionate interest.
</p><p>“Yes, your Excellency.”
</p><p>The Governor turned to the prisoner.
</p><p>“Do you know the law of this colony regarding vagrants?”
</p><p>“I do not,” the young man answered. His tone was politely curious, and
suggested that he would like to be further informed as to the local
peculiarities of a foreign country.
</p><p>“After two weeks’ residence,” the Governor recited, impressively, “all
able-bodied persons who will not work are put to work or deported. Have
you made any effort to find work?”
</p><p>Again the young man smiled charmingly. He shook his head and laughed.
“Oh dear no,” he said.
</p><p>The laugh struck the Governor as impertinent.
</p><p>“Then you must leave by the next mail-steamer, if you have any money to
pay your passage, or, if you have no money, you must go to work on the
roads. Have you any money?”
</p><p>“If I had, I wouldn’t--be a vagrant,” the young man answered. His voice
was low and singularly sweet. It seemed to suit the indolence of his
attitude and the lazy, inconsequent smile. “I called on our consular
agent here,” he continued, leisurely, “to write a letter home for money,
but he was disgracefully drunk, so I used his official note-paper to
write to the State Department about him, instead.”
</p><p>The Governor’s deepest interest was aroused. The American consular agent
was one of the severest trials he was forced to endure.
</p><p>“You are not a British subject, then? Ah, I see--and--er--your
representative was unable to assist you?”
</p><p>“He was drunk,” the young man repeated, placidly. “He has been drunk
ever since I have been here, particularly in the mornings.”
</p><p>He halted, as though the subject had lost interest for him, and gazed
pleasantly at the sunny bay and up at the moving palms.
</p><p>“Then,” said the Governor, as though he had not been interrupted, “as
you have no means of support, you will help support the colony until you
can earn money to leave it. That will do, sergeant.”
</p><p>The young man placed his hat upon his head and turned to move away, but
at the first step he swayed suddenly and caught at the negro’s shoulder,
clasping his other hand across his eyes. The sergeant held him by the
waist, and looked up at the Governor with some embarrassment.
</p><p>“The young gentleman has not been well, Sir Charles,” he said,
apologetically.
</p><p>The stranger straightened himself up and smiled vaguely. “I’m all
right,” he murmured. “Sun’s too hot.”
</p><p>“Sit down,” said the Governor.
</p><p>He observed the stranger more closely. He noticed now that beneath the
tan his face was delicate and finely cut, and that his yellow hair clung
closely to a well-formed head.
</p><p>“He seems faint. Has he had anything to eat?” asked the Governor.
</p><p>The sergeant grinned guiltily. “Yes, Sir Charles; we’ve been feeding him
at the barracks. It’s fever, sir.”
</p><p>Sir Charles was not unacquainted with fallen gentlemen, “beach-combers,”
 “remittance men,” and vagrants who had known better days, and there had
been something winning in this vagrant’s smile, and, moreover, he had
reported that thorn in his flesh, the consular agent, to the proper
authorities.
</p><p>He conceived an interest in a young man who, though with naked feet, did
not hesitate to correspond with his Minister of Foreign Affairs.
</p><p>“How long have you been ill?” he asked.
</p><p>The young man looked up from where he had sunk on the steps, and roused
himself with a shrug. “It doesn’t matter,” he said. “I’ve had a touch
of Chagres ever since I was on the Isthmus. I was at work there on the
railroad.”
</p><p>“Did you come here from Colon?”
</p><p>“No; I worked up the Pacific side. I was clerking with Rossner Brothers
at Amapala for a while, because I speak a little German, and then I
footed it over to Puerto Cortez and got a job with the lottery people.
They gave me twenty dollars a month gold for rolling the tickets, and
I put it all in the drawing, and won as much as ten.” He laughed, and
sitting erect, drew from his pocket a roll of thin green papers. “These
are for the next drawing,” he said. “Have some?” he added. He held
them towards the negro sergeant, who, under the eye of the Governor,
resisted, and then spread the tickets on his knee like a hand at cards.
“I stand to win a lot with these,” he said, with a cheerful sigh. “You
see, until the list’s published I’m prospectively worth twenty
thousand dollars. And,” he added, “I break stones in the sun.” He rose
unsteadily, and saluted the Governor with a nod. “Good-morning, sir,” he
said, “and thank you.”
</p><p>“Wait,” Sir Charles commanded. A new form of punishment had suggested
itself, in which justice was tempered with mercy. “Can you work one of
your American lawn-mowers?” he asked.
</p><p>The young man laughed delightedly. “I never tried,” he said, “but I’ve
seen it done.”
</p><p>“If you’ve been ill, it would be murder to put you on the shell
road.” The Governor’s dignity relaxed into a smile. “I don’t desire
international complications,” he said. “Sergeant, take this--him--to the
kitchen, and tell Corporal Mallon to give him that American lawn-mowing
machine. Possibly he may understand its mechanism. Mallon only cuts
holes in the turf with it.” And he waved his hand in dismissal, and as
the three men moved away he buried himself again in the perplexities of
the dog-tax.
</p><p>Ten minutes later the deliberations of the Council were disturbed by a
loud and persistent rattle, like the whir of a Maxim gun, which proved,
on investigation, to arise from the American lawn-mower. The vagrant was
propelling it triumphantly across the lawn, and gazing down at it with
the same fond pride with which a nursemaid leans over the perambulator
to observe her lusty and gurgling charge.
</p>
<p>The Councillors had departed, Sir Charles was thinking of breakfast, the
Maxim-like lawn-mower still irritated the silent hush of midday, when
from the waters of the inner harbor there came suddenly the sharp report
of a saluting gun and the rush of falling anchor-chains. There was
still a week to pass before the mail-steamer should arrive, and H. M. S.
Partridge had departed for Nassau. Besides these ships, no other vessel
had skirted the buoys of the bay in eight long smiling months. Mr.
Clarges, the secretary, with an effort to appear calm, and the orderly,
suffocated with the news, entered through separate doors at the same
instant.
</p><p>The secretary filed his report first. “A yacht’s just anchored in the
bay, Sir Charles,” he said.
</p><p>The orderly’s face fell. He looked aggrieved. “An American yacht,” he
corrected.
</p><p>“And much larger than the Partridge,” continued the secretary.
</p><p>The orderly took a hasty glance back over his shoulder. “She has her
launch lowered already, sir,” he said.
</p><p>Outside the whir of the lawn-mower continued undisturbed. Sir Charles
reached for his marine-glass, and the three men hurried to the veranda.
</p><p>“It looks like a man-of-war,” said Sir Charles. “No,” he added,
adjusting the binocular; “she’s a yacht. She flies the New York Yacht
Club pennant--now she’s showing the owner’s absent pennant. He must have
left in the launch. He’s coming ashore now.”
</p><p>“He seems in a bit of a hurry,” growled Mr. Clarges.
</p><p>“Those Americans always--” murmured Sir Charles from behind the
binocular. He did not quite know that he enjoyed this sudden onslaught
upon the privacy of his harbor and port.
</p><p>It was in itself annoying, and he was further annoyed to find that it
could in the least degree disturb his poise.
</p><p>The launch was growing instantly larger, like an express train
approaching a station at full speed; her flags flew out as flat as
pieces of painted tin; her bits of brass-work flashed like fire. Already
the ends of the wharves were white with groups of natives.
</p><p>“You might think he was going to ram the town,” suggested the secretary.
</p><p>“Oh, I say,” he exclaimed, in remonstrance, “he’s making in for your
private wharf.”
</p><p>The Governor was rearranging the focus of the glass with nervous
fingers. “I believe,” he said, “no--yes--upon my word, there are--there
are ladies in that launch!”
</p><p>“Ladies, sir!” The secretary threw a hasty glance at the binocular, but
it was in immediate use.
</p><p>The clatter of the lawn-mower ceased suddenly, and the relief of its
silence caused the Governor to lower his eyes. He saw the lawn-mower
lying prostrate on the grass. The vagrant had vanished.
</p><p>There was a sharp tinkle of bells, and the launch slipped up to the
wharf and halted as softly as a bicycle. A man in a yachting-suit jumped
from her, and making some laughing speech to the two women in the stern,
walked briskly across the lawn, taking a letter from his pocket as he
came. Sir Charles awaited him gravely; the occupants of the launch had
seen him, and it was too late to retreat.
</p><p>“Sir Charles Greville, I believe,” said the yachtsman. He bowed, and ran
lightly up the steps. “I am Mr. Robert Collier, from New York,” he said.
“I have a letter to you from your ambassador at Washington. If you’ll
pardon me, I’ll present it in person. I had meant to leave it, but
seeing you--” He paused, and gave the letter in his hand to Sir Charles,
who waved him towards his library.
</p><p>Sir Charles scowled at the letter through his monocle, and then shook
hands with his visitor. “I am very glad to see you, Mr. Collier,” he
said. “He says here you are preparing a book on our colonies in the West
Indies.” He tapped the letter with his monocle. “I am sure I shall be
most happy to assist you with any information in my power.”
</p><p>“Well, I am writing a book--yes,” Mr. Collier observed, doubtfully,
“but it’s a logbook. This trip I am on pleasure bent, and I also wish
to consult with you on a personal matter. However, that can wait.” He
glanced out of the windows to where the launch lay in the sun. “My wife
came ashore with me, Sir Charles,” he said, “so that in case there was
a Lady Greville, Mrs. Collier could call on her, and we could ask if you
would waive etiquette and do us the honor to dine with us to-night on
the yacht--that is, if you are not engaged.”
</p><p>Sir Charles smiled. “There is no Lady Greville,” he said, “and I
personally do not think I am engaged elsewhere.” He paused in thought,
as though to make quite sure he was not. “No,” he added, “I have no
other engagement. I will come with pleasure.”
</p><p>Sir Charles rose and clapped his hands for the orderly. “Possibly the
ladies will come up to the veranda?” he asked. “I cannot allow them to
remain at the end of my wharf.” He turned, and gave directions to the
orderly to bring limes and bottles of soda and ice, and led the way
across the lawn.
</p><p>Mrs. Collier and her friend had not explored the grounds of Government
House for over ten minutes before Sir Charles felt that many years ago
he had personally arranged their visit, that he had known them for even
a longer time, and that, now that they had finally arrived, they must
never depart.
</p><p>To them there was apparently nothing on his domain which did not thrill
with delightful interest. They were as eager as two children at a
pantomime, and as unconscious. As a rule, Sir Charles had found it
rather difficult to meet the women of his colony on a path which they
were capable of treading intelligently. In fairness to them, he
had always sought out some topic in which they could take an equal
part--something connected with the conduct of children, or the better
ventilation of the new school-house and chapel. But these new-comers did
not require him to select topics of conversation; they did not even wait
for him to finish those which he himself introduced. They flitted from
one end of the garden to the other with the eagerness of two midshipmen
on shore leave, and they found something to enjoy in what seemed to
the Governor the most commonplace of things. The Zouave uniform of the
sentry, the old Spanish cannon converted into peaceful gate-posts, the
aviary with its screaming paroquets, the botanical station, and even the
ice-machine were all objects of delight.
</p><p>On the other hand, the interior of the famous palace, which had been
sent out complete from London, and which was wont to fill the wives of
the colonials with awe or to reduce them to whispers, for some reason
failed of its effect. But they said they “loved” the large gold V. R.’s
on the back of the Councillors’ chairs, and they exclaimed aloud over
the red leather despatch-boxes and the great seal of the colony, and the
mysterious envelopes marked “On her Majesty’s service.”
</p><p>“Isn’t it too exciting, Florence?” demanded Mrs. Collier. “This is
the table where Sir Charles sits and writes letters’ on her Majesty’s
service,’ and presses these buttons, and war-ships spring up in perfect
shoals. Oh, Robert,” she sighed, “I do wish you had been a Governor!”
</p><p>The young lady called Florence stood looking down into the great
arm-chair in front of the Governor’s table.
</p><p>“May I?” she asked. She slid fearlessly in between the oak arms of the
chair and smiled about her. Afterwards Sir Charles remembered her as she
appeared at that moment with the red leather of the chair behind her,
with her gloved hands resting on the carved oak, and her head on one
side, smiling up at him. She gazed with large eyes at the blue linen
envelopes, the stiff documents in red tape, the tray of black sand, and
the goose-quill pens.
</p><p>“I am now the Countess Zika,” she announced; “no, I am Diana of the
Crossways, and I mean to discover a state secret and sell it to the
Daily Telegraph. Sir Charles,” she demanded, “if I press this electric
button is war declared anywhere, or what happens?”
</p><p>“That second button,” said Sir Charles, after deliberate scrutiny, “is
the one which communicates with the pantry.”
</p><p>The Governor would not consider their returning to the yacht for
luncheon.
</p><p>“You might decide to steam away as suddenly as you came,” he said,
gallantly, “and I cannot take that chance. This is Bachelor’s Hall, so
you must pardon my people if things do not go very smoothly.” He himself
led them to the great guest-chamber, where there had not been a guest
for many years, and he noticed, as though for the first time, that
the halls through which they passed were bare, and that the floor was
littered with unpacked boxes and gun-cases. He also observed for the
first time that maps of the colony, with the coffee-plantations and
mahogany belt marked in different inks, were not perhaps so decorative
as pictures and mirrors and family portraits. And he could have wished
that the native servants had not stared so admiringly at the guests,
nor directed each other in such aggressive whispers. On those other
occasions, when the wives of the Councillors came to the semi-annual
dinners, the native servants had seemed adequate to all that was
required of them. He recollected with a flush that in the town these
semi-annual dinners were described as banquets. He wondered if to these
visitors from the outside world it was all equally provincial.
</p><p>But their enjoyment was apparently unfeigned and generous. It was
evident that they had known each other for many years, yet they received
every remark that any of them made as though it had been pronounced by a
new and interesting acquaintance. Sir Charles found it rather difficult
to keep up with the talk across the table, they changed the subject
so rapidly, and they half spoke of so many things without waiting to
explain. He could not at once grasp the fact that people who had no
other position in the world save that of observers were speaking so
authoritatively of public men and public measures. He found, to his
delight, that for the first time in several years he was not presiding
at his own table, and that his guests seemed to feel no awe of him.
</p><p>“What’s the use of a yacht nowadays?” Collier was saying--“what’s the
use of a yacht, when you can go to sleep in a wagon-lit at the Gare du
Nord, and wake up at Vladivostok? And look at the time it saves; eleven
days to Gib, six to Port Said, and fifteen to Colombo--there you are,
only half-way around, and you’re already sixteen days behind the man in
the wagon-lit.”
</p><p>“But nobody wants to go to Vladivostok,” said Miss Cameron, “or anywhere
else in a wagon-lit. But with a yacht you can explore out-of-the-way
places, and you meet new and interesting people. We wouldn’t have met
Sir Charles if we had waited for a wagon-lit.” She bowed her head to
the Governor, and he smiled with gratitude. He had lost Mr. Collier
somewhere in the Indian Ocean, and he was glad she had brought them back
to the Windless Isles once more.
</p><p>“And again I repeat that the answer to that is, ‘Why not? said the March
Hare,’” remarked Mr. Collier, determinedly.
</p><p>The answer, as an answer, did not strike Sir Charles as a very good one.
But the ladies seemed to comprehend, for Miss Cameron said: “Did I tell
you about meeting him at Oxford just a few months before his death--at
a children’s tea-party? He was so sweet and understanding with them!
Two women tried to lionize him, and he ran away and played with the
children. I was more glad to meet him than any one I can think of. Not
as a personage, you know, but because I felt grateful to him.”
</p><p>“Yes, that way, distinctly,” said Mrs. Collier. “I should have felt that
way towards Mrs. Ewing more than any one else.”
</p><p>“I know, ‘Jackanapes,’” remarked Collier, shortly; “a brutal assault
upon the feelings, I say.”
</p><p>“Some one else said it before you, Robert,” Mrs. Collier commented,
calmly. “Perhaps Sir Charles met him at Apia.” They all turned and
looked at him. He wished he could say he had met him at Apia. He did
not quite see how they had made their way from a children’s tea party
at Oxford to the South Pacific islands, but he was anxious to join in
somewhere with a clever observation. But they never seemed to settle in
one place sufficiently long for him to recollect what he knew of it. He
hoped they would get around to the west coast of Africa in time. He had
been Governor of Sierra Leone for five years.
</p><p>His success that night at dinner on the yacht was far better. The others
seemed a little tired after the hours of sight-seeing to which he had
treated them, and they were content to listen. In the absence of Mr.
Clarges, who knew them word by word, he felt free to tell his three
stories of life at Sierra Leone. He took his time in the telling, and
could congratulate himself that his efforts had never been more keenly
appreciated. He felt that he was holding his own.
</p><p>The night was still and warm, and while the men lingered below at the
table, the two women mounted to the deck and watched the lights of
the town as they vanished one by one and left the moon in unchallenged
possession of the harbor. For a long time Miss Cameron stood silent,
looking out across the bay at the shore and the hills beyond. A fish
splashed near them, and the sound of oars rose from the mist that
floated above the water, until they were muffled in the distance. The
palms along the shore glistened like silver, and overhead the Southern
Cross shone white against a sky of purple. The silence deepened and
continued for so long a time that Mrs. Collier felt its significance,
and waited for the girl to end it.
</p><p>Miss Cameron raised her eyes to the stars and frowned. “I am not
surprised that he is content to stay here,” she said. “Are you? It is so
beautiful, so wonderfully beautiful.”
</p><p>For a moment Mrs. Collier made no answer. “Two years is a long time,
Florence,” she said; “and he is all I have; he is not only my only
brother, he is the only living soul who is related to me. That makes
it harder.”
</p><p>The girl seemed to find some implied reproach in the speech, for she
turned and looked at her friend closely. “Do you feel it is my fault,
Alice?” she asked.
</p><p>The older woman shook her head. “How could it be your fault?” she
answered. “If you couldn’t love him enough to marry him, you couldn’t,
that’s all. But that is no reason why he should have hidden himself from
all of us. Even if he could not stand being near you, caring as he did,
he need not have treated me so. We have done all we can do, and Robert
has been more than fine about it. He and his agents have written to
every consul and business house in Central America, and I don’t believe
there is a city that he hasn’t visited. He has sent him money and
letters to every bank and to every post-office--”
</p><p>The girl raised her head quickly.
</p><p>“--but he never calls for either,” Mrs. Collier continued, “for I know
that if he had read my letters he would have come home.”
</p><p>The girl lifted her head as though she were about to speak, and then
turned and walked slowly away. After a few moments she returned, and
stood, with her hands resting on the rail, looking down into the water.
“I wrote him two letters,” she said. In the silence of the night her
voice was unusually clear and distinct. “I--you make me wonder--if they
ever reached him.”
</p><p>Mrs. Collier, with her eyes fixed upon the girl, rose slowly from her
chair and came towards her. She reached out her hand and touched Miss
Cameron on the arm.
</p><p>“Florence,” she said, in a whisper, “have you--”
</p><p>The girl raised her head slowly, and lowered it again. “Yes,” she
answered; “I told him to come back--to come back to me. Alice,” she
cried, “I--I begged him to come back!” She tossed her hands apart and
again walked rapidly away, leaving the older woman standing motionless.
</p><p>A moment later, when Sir Charles and Mr. Collier stepped out upon the
deck, they discovered the two women standing close together, two white,
ghostly figures in the moonlight, and as they advanced towards them they
saw Mrs. Collier take the girl for an instant in her arms.
</p><p>Sir Charles was asking Miss Cameron how long she thought an immigrant
should be made to work for his freehold allotment, when Mr. Collier and
his wife rose at the same moment and departed on separate errands. They
met most mysteriously in the shadow of the wheel-house.
</p><p>“What is it? Is anything wrong with Florence?” Collier asked, anxiously.
“Not homesick, is she?”
</p><p>Mrs. Collier put her hands on her husband’s shoulders and shook her
head.
</p><p>“Wrong? No, thank Heaven! it’s as right as right can be!” she cried.
“She’s written to him to come back, but he’s never answered, and so--and
now it’s all right.”
</p><p>Mr. Collier gazed blankly at his wife’s upturned face. “Well, I don’t
see that,” he remonstrated. “What’s the use of her being in love with
him now when he can’t be found? What? Why didn’t she love him two years
ago when he was where you could get at him--at her house, for instance.
He was there most of his time. She would have saved a lot of trouble.
However,” he added, energetically, “this makes it absolutely necessary
to find that young man and bring him to his senses. We’ll search this
place for the next few days, and then we’ll try the mainland again. I
think I’ll offer a reward for him, and have it printed in Spanish, and
paste it up in all the plazas. We might add a line in English, ‘She has
changed her mind.’ That would bring him home, wouldn’t it?”
</p><p>“Don’t be unfeeling, Robert,” said Mrs. Collier.
</p><p>Her husband raised his eyes appealingly, and addressed himself to the
moon. “I ask you now,” he complained, “is that fair to a man who
has spent six months on muleback trying to round up a prodigal
brother-in-law?”
</p><p>That same evening, after the ladies had gone below, Mr. Collier asked
Sir Charles to assist him in his search for his wife’s brother, and
Sir Charles heartily promised his most active co-operation. There were
several Americans at work in the interior, he said, as overseers on
the coffee-plantations. It was possible that the runaway might be among
them. It was only that morning, Sir Charles remembered, that an American
had been at work “repairing his lawn-mower,” as he considerately
expressed it. He would send for him on the morrow.
</p><p>But on the morrow the slave of the lawn-mower was reported on the list
of prisoners as “missing,” and Corporal Mallon was grieved, but refused
to consider himself responsible. Sir Charles himself had allowed the
vagrant unusual freedom, and the vagrant had taken advantage of it, and
probably escaped to the hills, or up the river to the logwood camp.
</p><p>“Telegraph a description of him to Inspector Garrett,” Sir Charles
directed, “and to the heads of all up stations. And when he returns,
bring him to me.”
</p><p>So great was his zeal that Sir Charles further offered to join Mr.
Collier in his search among the outlying plantations; but Mr. Collier
preferred to work alone. He accordingly set out at once, armed with
letters to the different district inspectors, and in his absence
delegated to Sir Charles the pleasant duty of caring for the wants of
Miss Cameron and his wife. Sir Charles regarded the latter as deserving
of all sympathy, for Mr. Collier, in his efforts to conceal the fact
from the Governor that Florence Cameron was responsible, or in any
way concerned, in the disappearance of the missing man, had been too
mysterious. Sir Charles was convinced that the fugitive had swindled his
brother-in-law and stolen his sister’s jewels.
</p><p>The days which followed were to the Governor days and nights of strange
discoveries. He recognized that the missionaries from the great outside
world had invaded his shores and disturbed his gods and temples. Their
religion of progress and activity filled him with doubt and unrest.
</p><p>“In this century,” Mr. Collier had declared, “nothing can stand still.
It’s the same with a corporation, or a country, or a man. We must either
march ahead or fall out. We can’t mark time. What?”
</p><p>“Exactly--certainly not,” Sir Charles had answered. But in his heart
he knew that he himself had been marking time under these soft tropical
skies while the world was pushing forward. The thought had not disturbed
him before. Now he felt guilty. He conceived a sudden intolerance, if
not contempt, for the little village of whitewashed houses, for the
rafts of mahogany and of logwood that bumped against the pier-heads, for
the sacks of coffee piled high like barricades under the corrugated zinc
sheds along the wharf. Each season it had been his pride to note the
increase in these exports. The development of the resources of his
colony had been a work in which he had felt that the Colonial Secretary
took an immediate interest. He had believed that he was one of the
important wheels of the machinery which moved the British Empire: and
now, in a day, he was undeceived. It was forced upon him that to the
eyes of the outside world he was only a greengrocer operating on a large
scale; he provided the British public with coffee for its breakfast,
with drugs for its stomach, and with strange woods for its
dining-room furniture and walking-sticks. He combated this ignominious
characterization of his position indignantly. The new arrivals certainly
gave him no hint that they considered him so lightly. This thought
greatly comforted him, for he felt that in some way he was summoning
to his aid all of his assets and resources to meet an expert and final
valuation. As he ranged them before him he was disturbed and happy to
find that the value he placed upon them was the value they would have
in the eyes of a young girl--not a girl of the shy, mother-obeying,
man-worshipping English type, but a girl such as Miss Cameron seemed to
be, a girl who could understand what you were trying to say before you
said it, who could take an interest in rates of exchange and preside
at a dinner table, who was charmingly feminine and clever, and who was
respectful of herself and of others. In fact, he decided, with a flush,
that Miss Cameron herself was the young girl he had in his mind.
</p><p>“Why not?” he asked.
</p><p>The question came to him in his room, the sixth night of their visit,
and he strode over to the long pier-glass and stood studying himself
critically for the first time in years. He was still a fine-looking,
well-kept man. His hair was thin, but that fact did not show; and his
waist was lost, but riding and tennis would set that right. He had means
outside of his official salary, and there was the title, such as it was.
Lady Greville the wife of the birthday knight sounded as well as Lady
Greville the marchioness. And Americans cared for these things. He
doubted whether this particular American would do so, but he was adding
up all he had to offer, and that was one of the assets. He was sure
she would not be content to remain mistress of the Windless Isles. Nor,
indeed, did he longer care to be master there, now that he had inhaled
this quick, stirring breath from the outer world. He would resign, and
return and mix with the world again. He would enter Parliament; a man
so well acquainted as himself with the Gold Coast of Africa and with
the trade of the West Indies must always be of value in the Lower House.
This value would be recognized, no doubt, and he would become at
first an Under-Secretary for the Colonies, and then, in time, Colonial
Secretary and a cabinet minister. She would like that, he thought. And
after that place had been reached, all things were possible. For years
he had not dreamed such dreams--not since he had been a clerk in the
Foreign Office. They seemed just as possible now as they had seemed real
then, and just as near. He felt it was all absolutely in his own hands.
</p><p>He descended to the dining-room with the air of a man who already felt
the cares of high responsibility upon his shoulders. His head was erect
and his chest thrown forward. He was ten years younger; his manner was
alert, assured, and gracious. As he passed through the halls he was
impatient of the familiar settings of Government House; they seemed
to him like the furnishings of a hotel where he had paid his bill, and
where his luggage was lying strapped for departure in the hallway.
</p><p>In his library he saw on his table a number of papers lying open waiting
for his signature, the dog-tax among the others. He smiled to remember
how important it had seemed to him in the past--in that past of
indolence and easy content. Now he was on fire to put this rekindled
ambition to work, to tell the woman who had lighted it that it was all
from her and for her, that without her he had existed, that now he had
begun to live.
</p><p>They had never found him so delighful{sic} as he appeared that night.
He was like a man on the eve of a holiday. He made a jest of his past
efforts; he made them see, as he now saw it for the first time, that
side of the life of the Windless Isles which was narrow and petty,
even ridiculous. He talked of big men in a big way; he criticised, and
expounded, and advanced his own theories of government and the proper
control of an empire.
</p><p>Collier, who had returned from his unsuccessful search of the
plantations, shook his head.
</p><p>“It’s a pity you are not in London now,” he said, sincerely. “They need
some one there who has been on the spot. They can’t direct the colonies
from what they know of them in Whitehall.”
</p><p>Sir Charles fingered the dinner cloth nervously, and when he spoke,
fixed his eyes anxiously upon Miss Cameron.
</p><p>“Do you know,” he said, “I have been thinking of doing that very thing,
of resigning my post here and going back, entering Parliament, and all
the rest of it.”
</p><p>His declaration met with a unanimous chorus of delight. Miss Cameron
nodded her head with eager approval.
</p><p>“Yes, if I were a man, that is where I should wish to be,” she said, “at
the heart of it. Why, whatever you say in the House of Commons is heard
all over the world the next morning.”
</p><p>Sir Charles felt the blood tingle in his pulses. He had not been so
stirred in years. Her words ran to his head like wine.
</p><p>Mr. Collier raised his glass.
</p><p>“Here’s to our next meeting,” he said, “on the terrace of the House of
Commons.”
</p><p>But Miss Cameron interrupted. “No; to the Colonial Secretary,” she
amended.
</p><p>“Oh yes,” they assented, rising, and so drank his health, smiling down
upon him with kind, friendly glances and good-will.
</p><p>“To the Colonial Secretary,” they said. Sir Charles clasped the arms
of his chair tightly with his hands; his eyes were half closed, and his
lips pressed into a grim, confident smile. He felt that a single word
from her would make all that they suggested possible. If she cared for
such things, they were hers; he had them to give; they were ready lying
at her feet. He knew that the power had always been with him, lying
dormant in his heart and brain. It had only waited for the touch of the
Princess to wake it into life.
</p><p>The American visitors were to sail for the mainland the next day, but he
had come to know them so well in the brief period of their visit that he
felt he dared speak to her that same night. At least he could give
her some word that would keep him in her mind until they met again in
London, or until she had considered her answer. He could not expect her
to answer at once. She could take much time. What else had he to do now
but to wait for her answer? It was now all that made life.
</p><p>Collier and his wife had left the veranda and had crossed the lawn
towards the water’s edge. The moonlight fell full upon them with all the
splendor of the tropics, and lit the night with a brilliant, dazzling
radiance. From where Miss Cameron sat on the veranda in the shadow, Sir
Charles could see only the white outline of her figure and the indolent
movement of her fan. Collier had left his wife and was returning slowly
towards the step. Sir Charles felt that if he meant to speak he must
speak now, and quickly. He rose and placed himself beside her in the
shadow, and the girl turned her head inquiringly and looked up at him.
</p><p>But on the instant the hush of the night was broken by a sharp
challenge, and the sound of men’s voices raised in anger; there was the
noise of a struggle on the gravel, and from the corner of the house the
two sentries came running, dragging between them a slight figure that
fought and wrestled to be free.
</p><p>Sir Charles exclaimed with indignant impatience, and turning, strode
quickly to the head of the steps.
</p><p>“What does this mean?” he demanded. “What are you doing with that man?
Why did you bring him here?”
</p><p>As the soldiers straightened to attention, their prisoner ceased to
struggle, and stood with his head bent on his chest. His sombrero was
pulled down low across his forehead.
</p><p>“He was crawling through the bushes, Sir Charles,” the soldier panted,
“watching that gentleman, sir,”--he nodded over his shoulder towards
Collier. “I challenged, and he jumped to run, and we collared him. He
resisted, Sir Charles.”
</p><p>The mind of the Governor was concerned with other matters than
trespassers.
</p><p>“Well, take him to the barracks, then,” he said. “Report to me in the
morning. That will do.”
</p><p>The prisoner wheeled eagerly, without further show of resistance, and
the soldiers closed in on him on either side. But as the three men moved
away together, their faces, which had been in shadow, were now turned
towards Mr. Collier, who was advancing leisurely, and with silent
footsteps, across the grass. He met them face to face, and as he did so
the prisoner sprang back and threw out his arms in front of him, with
the gesture of a man who entreats silence. Mr. Collier halted as though
struck to stone, and the two men confronted each other without moving.
</p><p>“Good God!” Mr. Collier whispered.
</p><p>He turned stiffly and slowly, as though in a trance, and beckoned to his
wife, who had followed him.
</p><p>“Alice!” he called. He stepped backwards towards her, and taking her
hand in one of his, drew her towards the prisoner. “Here he is!” he
said.
</p><p>They heard her cry “Henry!” with the fierceness of a call for help,
and saw her rush forward and stumble into the arms of the prisoner, and
their two heads were bent close together.
</p><p>Collier ran up the steps and explained breathlessly.
</p><p>“And now,” he gasped, in conclusion, “what’s to be done? What’s he
arrested for? Is it bailable? What?”
</p><p>“Good heavens!” exclaimed Sir Charles, miserably. “It is my fault
entirely. I assure you I had no idea. How could I? But I should have
known, I should have guessed it.” He dismissed the sentries with a
gesture. “That will do,” he said. “Return to your posts.”
</p><p>Mr. Collier laughed with relief.
</p><p>“Then it is not serious?” he asked.
</p><p>“He--he had no money, that was all,” exclaimed Sir Charles. “Serious?
Certainly not. Upon my word, I’m sorry--”
</p><p>The young man had released himself from his sister’s embrace, and was
coming towards them; and Sir Charles, eager to redeem himself, advanced
hurriedly to greet him. But the young man did not see him; he was
looking past him up the steps to where Miss Cameron stood in the shadow.
</p><p>Sir Charles hesitated and drew back. The young man stopped at the foot
of the steps, and stood with his head raised, staring up at the white
figure of the girl, who came slowly forward.
</p><p>It was forced upon Sir Charles that in spite of the fact that the young
man before them had but just then been rescued from arrest, that in
spite of his mean garments and ragged sandals, something about him--the
glamour that surrounds the prodigal, or possibly the moonlight--gave him
an air of great dignity and distinction.
</p><p>As Miss Cameron descended the stairs, Sir Charles recognized for the
first time that the young man was remarkably handsome, and he resented
it. It hurt him, as did also the prodigal’s youth and his assured
bearing. He felt a sudden sinking fear, a weakening of all his vital
forces, and he drew in his breath slowly and deeply. But no one noticed
him; they were looking at the tall figure of the prodigal, standing with
his hat at his hip and his head thrown back, holding the girl with his
eyes.
</p><p>Collier touched Sir Charles on the arm, and nodded his head towards the
library. “Come,” he whispered, “let us old people leave them together.
They’ve a good deal to say.” Sir Charles obeyed in silence, and crossing
the library to the great oak chair, seated himself and leaned wearily
on the table before him. He picked up one of the goose quills and began
separating it into little pieces. Mr. Collier was pacing up and down,
biting excitedly on the end of his cigar. “Well, this has certainly been
a great night,” he said. “And it is all due to you, Sir Charles--all due
to you. Yes, they have you to thank for it.”
</p><p>“They?” said Sir Charles. He knew that it had to come. He wanted the man
to strike quickly.
</p><p>“They? Yes--Florence Cameron and Henry,” Mr. Collier answered. “Henry
went away because she wouldn’t marry him. She didn’t care for him then,
but afterwards she cared. Now they’re reunited,--and so they’re happy;
and my wife is more than happy, and I won’t have to bother any more; and
it’s all right, and all through you.”
</p><p>“I am glad,” said Sir Charles. There was a long pause, which the men,
each deep in his own thoughts, did not notice.
</p><p>“You will be leaving now, I suppose?” Sir Charles asked. He was looking
down, examining the broken pen in his hand.
</p><p>Mr. Collier stopped in his walk and considered. “Yes, I suppose they
will want to get back,” he said. “I shall be sorry myself. And you? What
will you do?”
</p><p>Sir Charles started slightly. He had not yet thought what he would do.
His eyes wandered over the neglected work, which had accumulated on the
desk before him. Only an hour before he had thought of it as petty and
little, as something unworthy of his energy. Since that time what change
had taken place in him?
</p><p>For him everything had changed, he answered, but in him there had been
no change; and if this thing which the girl had brought into his life
had meant the best in life, it must always mean that. She had been an
inspiration; she must remain his spring of action. Was he a slave, he
asked himself, that he should rebel? Was he a boy, that he could turn
his love to aught but the best account? He must remember her not as the
woman who had crushed his spirit, but as she who had helped him, who had
lifted him up to something better and finer. He would make sacrifice in
her name; it would be in her name that he would rise to high places and
accomplish much good.
</p><p>She would not know this, but he would know.
</p><p>He rose and brushed the papers away from him with an impatient sweep of
the hand.
</p><p>“I shall follow out the plan of which I spoke at dinner,” he answered.
“I shall resign here, and return home and enter Parliament.”
</p><p>Mr. Collier laughed admiringly. “I love the way you English take your
share of public life,” he said, “the way you spend yourselves for your
country, and give your brains, your lives, everything you have--all for
the empire.”
</p><p>Through the open window Sir Charles saw Miss Cameron half hidden by the
vines of the veranda. The moonlight falling about her transformed her
into a figure which was ideal, mysterious, and elusive, like a woman in
a dream. He shook his head wearily.
</p><p>“For the empire?” he asked.
