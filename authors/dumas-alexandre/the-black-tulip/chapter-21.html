<P>The night was a happy one, and the whole of the next day 
happier still.</P>
<P>During the last few days, the prison had been heavy, dark, 
and lowering, as it were, with all its weight on the 
unfortunate captive. Its walls were black, its air chilling, 
the iron bars seemed to exclude every ray of light.</P>
<P>But when Cornelius awoke next morning, a beam of the morning 
sun was playing about those iron bars; pigeons were hovering 
about with outspread wings, whilst others were lovingly 
cooing on the roof or near the still closed window.</P>
<P>Cornelius ran to that window and opened it; it seemed to him 
as if new life, and joy, and liberty itself were entering 
with this sunbeam into his cell, which, so dreary of late, 
was now cheered and irradiated by the light of love.</P>
<P>When Gryphus, therefore, came to see his prisoner in the 
morning, he no longer found him morose and lying in bed, but 
standing at the window, and singing a little ditty.</P>
<P>&quot;Halloa!&quot; exclaimed the jailer.</P>
<P>&quot;How are you this morning?&quot; asked Cornelius.</P>
<P>Gryphus looked at him with a scowl.</P>
<P>&quot;And how is the dog, and Master Jacob, and our pretty Rosa?&quot;</P>
<P>Gryphus ground his teeth, saying.  - </P>
<P>&quot;Here is your breakfast.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, friend Cerberus,&quot; said the prisoner; &quot;you are 
just in time; I am very hungry.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! you are hungry, are you?&quot; said Gryphus.</P>
<P>&quot;And why not?&quot; asked Van Baerle.</P>
<P>&quot;The conspiracy seems to thrive,&quot; remarked Gryphus.</P>
<P>&quot;What conspiracy?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, I know what I know, Master Scholar; just be 
quiet, we shall be on our guard.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Be on your guard, friend Gryphus; be on your guard as long 
as you please; my conspiracy, as well as my person, is 
entirely at your service.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We'll see that at noon.&quot;</P>
<P>Saying this, Gryphus went out.</P>
<P>&quot;At noon?&quot; repeated Cornelius; &quot;what does that mean? Well, 
let us wait until the clock strikes twelve, and we shall 
see.&quot;</P>
<P>It was very easy for Cornelius to wait for twelve at midday, 
as he was already waiting for nine at night.</P>
<P>It struck twelve, and there were heard on the staircase not 
only the steps of Gryphus, but also those of three or four 
soldiers, who were coming up with him.</P>
<P>The door opened. Gryphus entered, led his men in, and shut 
the door after them.</P>
<P>&quot;There, now search!&quot;</P>
<P>They searched not only the pockets of Cornelius, but even 
his person; yet they found nothing.</P>
<P>They then searched the sheets, the mattress, and the straw 
mattress of his bed; and again they found nothing.</P>
<P>Now, Cornelius rejoiced that he had not taken the third 
sucker under his own care. Gryphus would have been sure to 
ferret it out in the search, and would then have treated it 
as he did the first.</P>
<P>And certainly never did prisoner look with greater 
complacency at a search made in his cell than Cornelius.</P>
<P>Gryphus retired with the pencil and the two or three leaves 
of white paper which Rosa had given to Van Baerle, this was 
the only trophy brought back from the expedition.</P>
<P>At six Gryphus came back again, but alone; Cornelius tried 
to propitiate him, but Gryphus growled, showed a large tooth 
like a tusk, which he had in the corner of his mouth, and 
went out backwards, like a man who is afraid of being 
attacked from behind.</P>
<P>Cornelius burst out laughing, to which Gryphus answered 
through the grating,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Let him laugh that wins.&quot;</P>
<P>The winner that day was Cornelius; Rosa came at nine.</P>
<P>She was without a lantern. She needed no longer a light, as 
she could now read. Moreover, the light might betray her, as 
Jacob was dogging her steps more than ever. And lastly, the 
light would have shown her blushes.</P>
<P>Of what did the young people speak that evening? Of those 
matters of which lovers speak at the house doors in France, 
or from a balcony into the street in Spain, or down from a 
terrace into a garden in the East.</P>
<P>They spoke of those things which give wings to the hours; 
they spoke of everything except the black tulip.</P>
<P>At last, when the clock struck ten, they parted as usual.</P>
<P>Cornelius was happy, as thoroughly happy as a tulip-fancier 
would be to whom one has not spoken of his tulip.</P>
<P>He found Rosa pretty, good, graceful, and charming.</P>
<P>But why did Rosa object to the tulip being spoken of?</P>
<P>This was indeed a great defect in Rosa.</P>
<P>Cornelius confessed to himself, sighing, that woman was not 
perfect.</P>
<P>Part of the night he thought of this imperfection; that is 
to say, so long as he was awake he thought of Rosa.</P>
<P>After having fallen asleep, he dreamed of her.</P>
<P>But the Rosa of his dreams was by far more perfect than the 
Rosa of real life. Not only did the Rosa of his dreams speak 
of the tulip, but also brought to him a black one in a china 
vase.</P>
<P>Cornelius then awoke, trembling with joy, and muttering,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Rosa, Rosa, I love you.&quot;</P>
<P>And as it was already day, he thought it right not to fall 
asleep again, and he continued following up the line of 
thought in which his mind was engaged when he awoke.</P>
<P>Ah! if Rosa had only conversed about the tulip, Cornelius 
would have preferred her to Queen Semiramis, to Queen 
Cleopatra, to Queen Elizabeth, to Queen Anne of Austria; 
that is to say, to the greatest or most beautiful queens 
whom the world has seen.</P>
<P>But Rosa had forbidden it under pain of not returning; Rosa 
had forbidden the least mention of the tulip for three days. 
That meant seventy-two hours given to the lover to be sure; 
but it was seventy-two hours stolen from the horticulturist.</P>
<P>There was one consolation: of the seventy-two hours during 
which Rosa would not allow the tulip to be mentioned, 
thirty-six had passed already; and the remaining thirty-six 
would pass quickly enough: eighteen with waiting for the 
evening's interview, and eighteen with rejoicing in its 
remembrance.</P>
<P>Rosa came at the same hour, and Cornelius submitted most 
heroically to the pangs which the compulsory silence 
concerning the tulip gave him.</P>
<P>His fair visitor, however, was well aware that, to command 
on the one point, people must yield on another; she 
therefore no longer drew back her hands from the grating, 
and even allowed Cornelius tenderly to kiss her beautiful 
golden tresses.</P>
<P>Poor girl! she had no idea that these playful little lovers' 
tricks were much more dangerous than speaking of the tulip 
was; but she became aware of the fact as she returned with a 
beating heart, with glowing cheeks, dry lips, and moist 
eyes.</P>
<P>And on the following evening, after the first exchange of 
salutations, she retired a step, looking at him with a 
glance, the expression of which would have rejoiced his 
heart could he but have seen it.</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;she is up.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She is up! Who? What?&quot; asked Cornelius, who did not venture 
on a belief that Rosa would, of her own accord, have 
abridged the term of his probation.</P>
<P>&quot;She? Well, my daughter, the tulip,&quot; said Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;What!&quot; cried Cornelius, &quot;you give me permission, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do,&quot; said Rosa, with the tone of an affectionate mother 
who grants a pleasure to her child.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, Rosa!&quot; said Cornelius, putting his lips to the grating 
with the hope of touching a cheek, a hand, a forehead,  -  
anything, in short.</P>
<P>He touched something much better,  -  two warm and half open 
lips.</P>
<P>Rosa uttered a slight scream.</P>
<P>Cornelius understood that he must make haste to continue the 
conversation. He guessed that this unexpected kiss had 
frightened Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;Is it growing up straight?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Straight as a rocket,&quot; said Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;How high?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At least two inches.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Rosa, take good care of it, and we shall soon see it 
grow quickly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Can I take more care of it?&quot; said she. &quot;Indeed, I think of 
nothing else but the tulip.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of nothing else, Rosa? Why, now I shall grow jealous in my 
turn.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, you know that to think of the tulip is to think of you; 
I never lose sight of it. I see it from my bed, on awaking 
it is the first object that meets my eyes, and on falling 
asleep the last on which they rest. During the day I sit and 
work by its side, for I have never left my chamber since I 
put it there.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are right Rosa, it is your dowry, you know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, and with it I may marry a young man of twenty-six or 
twenty-eight years, whom I shall be in love with.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't talk in that way, you naughty girl.&quot;</P>
<P>That evening Cornelius was one of the happiest of men. Rosa 
allowed him to press her hand in his, and to keep it as long 
as he would, besides which he might talk of his tulip as 
much as he liked.</P>
<P>From that hour every day marked some progress in the growth 
of the tulip and in the affection of the two young people.</P>
<P>At one time it was that the leaves had expanded, and at 
another that the flower itself had formed.</P>
<P>Great was the joy of Cornelius at this news, and his 
questions succeeded one another with a rapidity which gave 
proof of their importance.</P>
<P>&quot;Formed!&quot; exclaimed Cornelius, &quot;is it really formed?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is,&quot; repeated Rosa.</P>
<P>Cornelius trembled with joy, so much so that he was obliged 
to hold by the grating.</P>
<P>&quot;Good heavens!&quot; he exclaimed.</P>
<P>Then, turning again to Rosa, he continued his questions.</P>
<P>&quot;Is the oval regular? the cylinder full? and are the points 
very green?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The oval is almost one inch long, and tapers like a needle, 
the cylinder swells at the sides, and the points are ready 
to open.&quot;</P>
<P>Two days after Rosa announced that they were open.</P>
<P>&quot;Open, Rosa!&quot; cried Cornelius. &quot;Is the involucrum open? but 
then one may see and already distinguish  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>Here the prisoner paused, anxiously taking breath.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Rosa, &quot;one may already distinguish a thread 
of different colour, as thin as a hair.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And its colour?&quot; asked Cornelius, trembling.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; answered Rosa, &quot;it is very dark!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Brown?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Darker than that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Darker, my good Rosa, darker? Thank you. Dark as  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Dark as the ink with which I wrote to you.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius uttered a cry of mad joy.</P>
<P>Then, suddenly stopping and clasping his hands, he said,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Oh, there is not an angel in heaven that may be compared to 
you, Rosa!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed!&quot; said Rosa, smiling at his enthusiasm.</P>
<P>&quot;Rosa, you have worked with such ardour,  -  you have done so 
much for me! Rosa, my tulip is about to flower, and it will 
flower black! Rosa, Rosa, you are the most perfect being on 
earth!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;After the tulip, though.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! be quiet, you malicious little creature, be quiet! For 
shame! Do not spoil my pleasure. But tell me, Rosa,  -  as 
the tulip is so far advanced, it will flower in two or three 
days, at the latest?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To-morrow, or the day after.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! and I shall not see it,&quot; cried Cornelius, starting 
back, &quot;I shall not kiss it, as a wonderful work of the 
Almighty, as I kiss your hand and your cheek, Rosa, when by 
chance they are near the grating.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa drew near, not by accident, but intentionally, and 
Cornelius kissed her tenderly.</P>
<P>&quot;Faith, I shall cull it, if you wish it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, no, no, Rosa! when it is open, place it carefully in 
the shade, and immediately send a message to Haarlem, to the 
President of the Horticultural Society, that the grand black 
tulip is in flower. I know well it is far to Haarlem, but 
with money you will find a messenger. Have you any money, 
Rosa?&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa smiled.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; she said.</P>
<P>&quot;Enough?&quot; said Cornelius.</P>
<P>&quot;I have three hundred guilders.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, if you have three hundred guilders, you must not send a 
messenger, Rosa, but you must go to Haarlem yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But what in the meantime is to become of the flower?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, the flower! you must take it with you. You understand 
that you must not separate from it for an instant.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But whilst I am not separating from it, I am separating 
from you, Mynheer Cornelius.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! that's true, my sweet Rosa. Oh, my God! how wicked men 
are! What have I done to offend them, and why have they 
deprived me of my liberty? You are right, Rosa, I cannot 
live without you. Well, you will send some one to Haarlem, 
 -  that's settled; really, the matter is wonderful enough 
for the President to put himself to some trouble. He will 
come himself to Loewestein to see the tulip.&quot;</P>
<P>Then, suddenly checking himself, he said, with a faltering 
voice,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Rosa, Rosa, if after all it should not flower black!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, surely, surely, you will know to-morrow, or the day 
after.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And to wait until evening to know it, Rosa! I shall die 
with impatience. Could we not agree about a signal?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I shall do better than that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What will you do?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If it opens at night, I shall come and tell you myself. If 
it is day, I shall pass your door, and slip you a note 
either under the door, or through the grating, during the 
time between my father's first and second inspection.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Rosa, let it be so. One word of yours, announcing this 
news to me, will be a double happiness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There, ten o'clock strikes,&quot; said Rosa, &quot;I must now leave 
you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said Cornelius, &quot;go, Rosa, go!&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa withdrew, almost melancholy, for Cornelius had all but 
sent her away.</P>
<P>It is true that he did so in order that she might watch over 
his black tulip. </P></article>
