<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The Comanche must have been disgusted. He had been trying for
some time to steal the mustang of Avon Burnet, with the result
that the pony was about to steal him, unless he prevented it offhand.</p>

<p>The Indian heard the whistle from the edge of the bush, and the
instant increase of speed, on the part of the stubborn mustang,
made the meaning clear to him. He did not know but that three
or four Texans were waiting in the mesquite, and that, if he stayed
on the back of the steed a minute longer, he would be carried
directly into their arms.</p>

<p>Consequently he did not hesitate. He went off of Thunderbolt,
as if struck by a cannon ball, and, heading out on the prairie,
ran with might and main, quickly disappearing in the darkness,
and was seen no more.</p>

<p>"Ah, my own Thunderbolt!" exclaimed the delighted Avon, patting
the nose of his beast, who was as happy as he at being restored
to his young master; "I thought I would never see you again, but
here you are."</p>

<p>He sprang upon the bare back, and the pony started through the
bush for the cabin.</p>

<p>Arriving there, matters were found in a satisfactory shape. Ballyhoo
Gleeson was the only cowboy that had remained behind with Captain
Shirril. The rest had started to look after the cattle. It has
been shown that a number had been stampeded, and since all care
was necessarily withdrawn from the others, they were likely to
follow suit. Then, too, it was probable that the Comanches would
see their chance of securing some of the herd, and would make
the attempt despite the rough handling they had received.</p>

<p>Nothing could have attested more strikingly the fact that our
friends were accustomed to their wild, dangerous life, than the
manner in which they now acted. A half hour before, the little
family within the cabin considered themselves in such imminent
peril of being burned to death that they allowed young Burnet
to run the greatest risk to secure help, before it was too late.</p>

<p>But now Captain Shirril and Ballyhoo Gleeson sat before the fire,
that was burning brightly, smoking their pipes, and talking as
though the occurrence was of the most ordinary nature. The ranchman
had made sure of his supply of tobacco, and intended to ride back
to camp, after spending an hour or so within the house.</p>

<p>Everyone had eaten supper before the lively incidents opened,
and Mrs. Shirril now resumed her sitting in front of the fire,
occasionally taking part in the words of her husband and guests.
Dinah was heard muttering angrily to herself upstairs, as she
investigated the damages done by the visitor in her apartment.</p>

<p>Avon, on his return, told his uncle about his horse, explaining
that he was fortunate enough to recover Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>"You were luckier than I supposed you would be," said the captain,
as his nephew drew up his chair near them.</p>

<p>"Do you think," asked the wife, "that the Comanches will trouble
us further, husband?"</p>

<p>"There is no danger," he replied, calmly puffing his pipe; "is
there, Ballyhoo?"</p>

<p>"None at all," was the calm response.</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps that because they had suffered so severely,
they would come back to revenge themselves," ventured the little
woman, still busily plying her needle.</p>

<p>"But you see the damage was done, not by you and Dinah, though
you did your part, but by the men, and <em>them's</em> the ones
they'll go for," observed Ballyhoo.</p>

<p>"That is not the invariable rule with Indians," was the truthful
remark of Mrs. Shirril. "It makes little difference to them whether
the innocent or guilty suffer."</p>

<p>"But," said the husband, "the prime object of the redskins is
cattle, with perhaps horses thrown in. You know they have been
hanging round for a number of days, waiting for a chance before
we started north; they will make an effort to run off those stampeded
cattle to-night, and likely enough will follow us into the Indian
Nation, on the watch for a chance to gather in several hundred
hoofs."</p>

<p>"I think there's one thing that's encouraging," said Avon, addressing
all his friends; "you know how dry the roof of the house is. If
Dinah hadn't put her foot down when she did, there would have
been no cabin at this moment. The Comanches tried to fire the
sides, and failing in that, gave their attention to the roof,
where they came so near succeeding."</p>

<p>"What do you refer to as encouraging, Avon?" asked his uncle.</p>

<p>"There's a storm in the air; we are going to have a regular driving
rain, that will soak the roof until a ton of live-coals on the
top wouldn't set fire to the planking."</p>

<p>"Baby is right," said Ballyhoo, with a nod of his head; "rain
will fall within twelve hours."</p>

<p>"That <em>is</em> good news," said the wife, with a pleased look;
"I shall now see the captain and the rest of you leave without
a misgiving as concerns ourselves."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't feel frightened, Edna, if old Wygwind and his gang
of imps should come whooping down upon you?" asked the captain,
looking sideways, with an expression of admiration and love glowing
from his shaggy face.</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to say we would not be frightened, but Dinah
and I would feel secure inside, so long as there was no danger
of the building being burned. I wonder whether Wygwind led this
party."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised if he did; he's one of the worst scamps
that ever lived."</p>

<p>"You're right," assented Ballyhoo. "I believe he led this gang,
though a chap couldn't tell in the darkness. You know what a thief
he is."</p>

<p>The allusion was to the notorious Comanche Wygwind, one of the
many leaders belonging to that tribe. He was a powerful, wiry
Indian, in middle life, who had long been detested by the ranchmen
for his thievish and brutal propensities. He had stolen hundreds
of cattle, not to mention horses, and though often pursued, and
driven more than once into dangerous quarters, he had managed
in some way to pull through to the present time.</p>

<p>"If he should get inside," said the captain slyly, "and you should
get the drop on him, wife, I advise that you don't let him walk
out of the door unharmed."</p>

<p>"That depends on circumstances," quietly replied his better half;
"if he should appeal to me, and he had done no particular harm,
I could hardly refuse him. However, I don't think if he does enter
it will be through the scuttle."</p>

<p>"The next time it will be best to turn him over to the mercies
of Dinah."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it will go ill with him if I do. I heard her say
to herself, when she went upstairs after you, that, on the return
trip, she meant to fall from the round of the ladder upon him:
the result would have been frightful."</p>

<p>"Yes; that red man doesn't know all that he escaped."</p>

<p>The mutterings of Dinah were still audible overhead, and she
was seen the next minute, descending the primitive stairs.</p>

<p>The little party smiled, and the captain turned toward her.</p>

<p>"Well, Dinah, you didn't find much damage done in your room,
did you?"</p>

<p>"Humph! 'cause de warmint didn't hab time. I only wish I had
a chance to wrung his neck."</p>

<p>"No doubt you would have done it, but I think we all have cause
for gratitude that things turned out as well as they did."</p>

<p>"I guess you didn't notice dat big hole dey come nigh burning
frough de roof, did you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I saw it; it would have been much worse but for you;
I hope the fire didn't injure your shoe."</p>

<p>She turned her foot and looked at the broad sole of the heavy
shoe, as though the thought had not occurred to her before.</p>

<p>"It am scorchified a little," she said.</p>

<p>"Never mind," remarked Ballyhoo gravely; "I'll give out a contract
for a new pair for you, when we get into Kansas, and send a couple
of the boys back with them, if they don't prove too big a load."</p>

<p>"I consider such remarks as onnecessary and slightsome," replied
Dinah, with a scornful toss of her head; "I wore number 'lebens,
which am just a lady's size; I reckons you can't do much better
dan dat."</p>

<p>"If my feet keep on growing for a few years, I may get there
in time, but you shall have the shoes, Dinah, if the right size
can be bought in any of the big establishments."</p>

<p>"T'ank you," replied the African, who thought it best not to
repel the offer of her friend; "dese am gettin' wored consid'ble,
and by de time you got back, I'll need anoder pair."</p>

<p>The evening was advancing. In answer to Ballyhoo's inquiries,
Captain Shirril looked at his watch, and said that it was nearly
eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>"I must be off," remarked the tall ranchman, rising to his feet;
"we make an early start, and I don't know how the boys have made
out with the cattle; they may need my help."</p>

<p>"I may as well go with you," said Avon, looking inquiringly at
his uncle; "for there is to be no more work here."</p>

<p>"It will be just as well," replied the captain.</p>

<p>The youth took his saddle and accoutrements from the corner,
where they had been lying, and stepping outside, adjusted them
upon Thunderbolt, who whinnied with pleasure at the promise of
carrying his loved owner on his back indefinitely. The two had
become attached by their companionship on the hunt and ranch,
and the delight of the youth on recovering his mustang was beyond
expression.</p>

<p>While he was busy at this brief task, the members of the little
family kept their feet, discussing matters in which each was interested.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm ready, Ballyhoo," called Avon, in his cheery voice,
stepping quickly through the open door.</p>

<p>He placed one arm around the neck of his aunt and kissed her
affectionately, shook hands with Dinah, adding as he crossed palms
with his uncle:</p>

<p>"I expect to see you again, soon. Keep up a good heart, auntie,
while we are gone, which I don't think will be for long. Good-by,
all!"</p>

<p>He put his foot in the stirrup, swung himself into the saddle,
at the same moment that his companion did the same, and the couple
headed their animals to the northward.</p>

<p>Captain Shirril and the women remained in the door, looking forth
in the darkness, and listening until the sounds of the hoofs died
out in the distance. Then the Texan led the way inside, adjusting
the bar in place so that no one could enter without permission.</p>

<p>The extra horse which Avon had ridden to the cabin was turned
loose in the bush, to be recovered and used by the captain when
he wished to ride to the camp. Ballyhoo had removed the saddle
and bridle, which lay in the corner where Avon's had awaited him.</p>

<p>The Texan stood a minute, looking around the room, as if trying
to recall any forgotten duty, but thought of none.</p>

<p>"It is later than I suspected," said he, addressing his wife
and consulting his watch again; "and we may as well retire."</p>

<p>He lighted a common tallow candle, and with that in his hand,
led the way up the ladder, followed by the others. Fifteen minutes
later, everyone was sleeping as soundly as though the evening
had not been disturbed by any unusual incident.</p>
