<p>"Your sister," observed Dr. Bailey to Scott Seagrave, "must be
constructed of India-rubber. There's nothing whatever the matter
with her spine or with her interior. The slight trace of concussion
is disappearing; there's no injury to the skull; nothing serious
to apprehend. Her body will probably be black and blue for a week
or two; she'll doubtless prefer to remain in bed to-morrow and
next day. And that is the worst news I have to tell you."</p>

<p>He smiled at Kathleen and Duane, who stood together, listening.</p>

<p>"I told you so," said Scott, intensely relieved. "Duane got scared
and made me send that telegram. I fell out of a tree once, and
my sister's symptoms were exactly like mine."</p>

<p>Kathleen stole silently from the room; Duane passed his arm through
the doctor's and walked with him to the big, double sleigh which
was waiting. Scott followed with Dr. Goss.</p>

<p>"About this other matter," said Dr. Bailey; "I can't make it
out, Duane. I saw Jack Dysart two days ago. He was very nervous,
but physically sound. I can't believe it was suicide."</p>

<p>He unfolded the telegram which had come that morning directed
to Duane.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>Mrs. Jack Dysart's husband died this morning. Am trying to<br/>
communicate with her. Wire if you know her whereabouts.</em>"

</p>
</div>
<p>It was signed with old Mr. Dysart's name, but Dr. Bailey knew
he could never have written the telegram or even have comprehended
it.</p>

<p>The men stood grouped in the snow near the sleigh, waiting; and
presently Rosalie came out on the terrace with Kathleen and Delancy
Grandcourt. Her colour was very bad and there were heavy circles
under her eyes, but she spoke with perfect self-possession, made
her adieux quietly, kissed Kathleen twice, and suffered Grandcourt
to help her into the sleigh.</p>

<p>Then Grandcourt got in beside her, the two doctors swung aboard
in front, bells jingled, and they whirled away over the snow.</p>

<p>Kathleen, with Scott and Duane on either side of her, walked
back to the house.</p>

<p>"Well," said Scott, his voice betraying nervous reaction, "we'll
resume life where we left off when Geraldine did. Don't tell her
anything about Dysart yet. Suppose we go and cheer her up!"</p>

<p>Geraldine lay on the pillows, rather pallid under the dark masses
of hair clustering around and framing her face. She unclosed her
eyes when Kathleen opened the door for a preliminary survey, and
the others filed solemnly in.</p>

<p>"Hello," she said faintly, and smiled at Duane.</p>

<p>"How goes it, Sis?" asked her brother affectionately, shouldering
Duane aside.</p>

<p>"A little sleepy, but all right. Why on earth did you send for
Dr. Bailey? It was horribly expensive."</p>

<p>"Duane did," said her brother briefly. "He was scared blue."</p>

<p>Her eyes rested on her lover, indulgent, dreamily humorous.</p>

<p>"Such expensive habits," she murmured, "when everybody is economising.
Kathleen, dear, he needs schooling. You and Mr. Tappan ought to
take him in hand and cultiwate him good and hard!"</p>

<p>Scott, who had been wandering around his sister's room with innate
masculine curiosity concerning the mysteries of intimate femininity,
came upon a sketch of Duane's&mdash;the colour not entirely dry yet.</p>

<p>"It's Sis!" he exclaimed in unfeigned approval. "Lord, but you've
made her a good-looker, Duane. Does she really appear like that
to you?"</p>

<p>"And then some," said Duane. "Keep your fingers off it."</p>

<p>Scott admired in silence for a while, then: "You certainly are
a shark at it, Duane.... You've struck your gait all right....
I wish I had.... This Rose-beetle business doesn't promise very
well."</p>

<p>"You write most interestingly about it," said Kathleen warmly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can write.... I believe journalism would suit me."</p>

<p>"The funny column?" suggested Geraldine.</p>

<p>"Yes, or the birth, marriage, and death column. I could head
it, 'Hatched, Matched, and Snatched'&#11834;"</p>

<p>"That is perfectly horrid, Scott," protested his sister; "why
do you let him say such rowdy things, Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"I can't help it," sighed Kathleen; "I haven't the slightest
influence with him. Look at him now!"&mdash;as he laughingly passed
his arm around her and made her two-step around the room, protesting,
rosy, deliciously helpless in the arms of this tall young fellow
who held her inflexibly but with a tenderness surprising.</p>

<p>Duane smiled and seated himself on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>"You plucky little thing," he said, "were you perfectly mad to
try to block that boar in the scrub? You won't ever try such a
thing again, will you, dear?"</p>

<p>"I was so excited, Duane; I never thought there was any danger&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You didn't think whether there was or not. You didn't care."</p>

<p>She laughed, wincing under his accusing gaze.</p>

<p>"You <em>must</em> care, dear."</p>

<p>"I do," she said, serious when he became so grave. "Tell me again
exactly what happened."</p>

<p>He said: "I don't think the brute saw you; he was hard hit and
was going blind, and he side-swiped you and sent you flying into
the air among those icy rocks." He drew a long breath, managed
to smile in response to her light touch on his hand. "And that's
how it was, dear. He crashed headlong into a tree; your last shot
did it. But Miller and I thought he'd got you. We carried you
in&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> did?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes. I never was so thoroughly scared in all my life."</p>

<p>"You poor boy. Are the rifles safe? And did Miller save the head?"</p>

<p>"He did," said Duane grimly, "and your precious rifles are intact."</p>

<p>"Lean down, close," she said; "closer. There's more than the
rifles intact, dear."</p>

<p>"Not your poor bruised body!"</p>

<p>"My self-respect," she whispered, the pink colour stealing into
her cheeks. "I've won it back. Do you understand? I've gone after
my other self and got her back. I'm mistress of myself, Duane;
I'm in full control, first in command. Do you know what that means?"</p>

<p>"Does it mean&mdash;me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"When you will."</p>

<p>He leaned above her, looking down into her eyes. Their fearless
sweetness set him trembling.</p>

<p>On the floor below Kathleen, at the piano, was playing the Menuet
d'Exaudet. When she ended, Scott, cheerily busy with his infant
Rose-beetles, went about his affairs whistling the air.</p>

<p>"Our betrothal dance; do you remember?" murmured Geraldine. "Do
you love me, Duane? Tell me so; I need it."</p>

<p>"I love you," he said.</p>

<p>She lay looking at him a moment, her head cradled in her dark
hair. Then, moving slowly, and smiling at the pain it gave her,
she put both bare arms around his neck, and lifted her lips to
his.</p>

<p>It was the end of the prologue; the curtain trembled on the rise;
the story of Fate was beginning. But they had no eyes except for
each other, paid no heed save to each other.</p>

<p>And, unobserved by them, the vast curtain rose in silence, beginning
the strange drama which neither time nor death, perhaps, has power
to end.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>
