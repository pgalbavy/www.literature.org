<p>But when she asked him what it meant, on their homeward way,
he was silent. They had come a few paces from the church without
speaking, walking slowly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it meant to me," she said, as he did not
immediately reply. "Almost any music of Handel's always means
one thing above all others to me: courage! That's it. It makes
cowardice of whining seem so infinitesimal&mdash;it makes <em>MOST
</em>things in our hustling little lives seem infinitesimal."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "It seems odd, doesn't it, that people down-town
are hurrying to trains and hanging to straps in trolley-cars,
weltering every way to get home and feed and sleep so they can
get down-town to-morrow. And yet there isn't anything down there
worth getting to. They're like servants drudging to keep the house
going, and believing the drudgery itself is the great thing. They
make so much noise and fuss and dirt they forget that the house
was meant to live in. The housework has to be done, but the people
who do it have been so overpaid that they're confused and worship
the housework. They're overpaid, and yet, poor things! they haven't
anything that a chicken can't have. Of course, when the world
gets to paying its wages sensibly that will be different."</p>

<p>"Do you mean 'communism'?" she asked, and she made their slow
pace a little slower&mdash;they had only three blocks to go.</p>

<p>"Whatever the word is, I only mean that things don't look very
sensible now&mdash;especially to a man that wants to keep out of 'em
and can't! 'Communism'? Well, at least any 'decent sport' would
say it's fair for all the strong runners to start from the same
mark and give the weak ones a fair distance ahead, so that all
can run something like even on the stretch. And wouldn't it be
pleasant, really, if they could all cross the winning-line together?
Who really enjoys beating anybody&mdash;if he sees the beaten man's
face? The only way we can enjoy getting ahead of other people
nowadays is by forgetting what the other people feel. And that,"
he added, "is nothing of what the music meant to me. You see,
if I keep talking about what it didn't mean I can keep from telling
you what it did mean."</p>

<p>"Didn't it mean courage to you, too&mdash;a little?" she asked. "Triumph
and praise were in it, and somehow those things mean courage to
me."</p>

<p>"Yes, they were all there," Bibbs said. "I don't know the name
of what he played, but I shouldn't think it would matter much.
The man that makes the music must leave it to you what it can
mean to you, and the name he puts to it can't make much difference&mdash;except
to himself and people very much like him, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I suppose that's true, though I'd never thought of it like that."</p>

<p>"I imagine music must make feelings and paint pictures in the
minds of the people who hear it," Bibbs went on, musingly, "according
to their own natures as much as according to the music itself.
The musician might compose something and play it, wanting you
to think of the Holy Grail, and some people who heard it would
think of a prayer-meeting, and some would think of how good they
were themselves, and a boy might think of himself at the head
of a solemn procession, carrying a banner and riding a white horse.
And then, if there were some jubilant passages in the music, he'd
think of a circus."</p>

<p>They had reached her gate, and she set her hand upon it, but
did not open it. Bibbs felt that this was almost the kindest of
her kindnesses&mdash;not to be prompt in leaving him.</p>

<p>"After all," she said, "you didn't tell me whether you liked
it."</p>

<p>"No. I didn't need to."</p>

<p>"No, that's true, and I didn't need to ask. I knew. But you said
you were trying to keep from telling me what it did mean."</p>

<p>"I can't keep from telling it any longer," he said. "The music
meant to me&mdash;it meant the kindness of&mdash;of you."</p>

<p>"Kindness? How?"</p>

<p>"You thought I was a sort of lonely tramp&mdash;and sick&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," she said, decidedly. "I thought perhaps you'd like to hear
Dr. Kraft play. And you did."</p>

<p>"It's curious; sometimes it seemed to me that it was you who
were playing."</p>

<p>Mary laughed. "I? I strum! Piano. A little Chopin&mdash;Grieg &mdash;Chaminade.
You wouldn't listen!"</p>

<p>Bibbs drew a deep breath. "I'm frightened again," he said, in
an unsteady voice. "I'm afraid you'll think I'm pushing, but&mdash;"
He paused, and the words sank to a murmur.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you want ME to play for you!" she said. "Yes, gladly.
It will be merely absurd after what you heard this afternoon.
I play like a hundred thousand other girls, and I like it. I'm
glad when any one's willing to listen, and if you&mdash;" She stopped,
checked by a sudden recollection, and laughed ruefully. "But my
piano won't be here after to-night. I &mdash;I'm sending it away
to-morrow. I'm afraid that if you'd like me to play to you you'd
have to come this evening."</p>

<p>"You'll let me?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you care to."</p>

<p>"If I could play&mdash;" he said, wistfully, "if I could play like
that old man in the church I could thank you."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you haven't heard me play. I <em>KNOW </em>you liked
this afternoon, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bibbs. "It was the greatest happiness I've ever known."</p>

<p>It was too dark to see his face, but his voice held such plain
honesty, and he spoke with such complete unconsciousness of saying
anything especially significant, that she knew it was the truth.
For a moment she was nonplussed, then she opened the gate and
went in. "You'll come after dinner, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, not moving. "Would you mind if I stood here until
time to come in?"</p>

<p>She had reached the steps, and at that she turned, offering him
the response of laughter and a gay gesture of her muff toward
the lighted windows of the New House, as though bidding him to
run home to his dinner.</p>

<p>That night, Bibbs sat writing in his note-book.</p>

<p>  Music can come into a blank life, and fill it.  Everything
that   is beautiful is music, if you can listen.</p>

<p>  There is no gracefulness like that of a graceful woman at a
grand   piano.  There is a swimming loveliness of line that seems
to merge   with the running of the sound, and you seem, as you
watch her, to   see what you are hearing and to hear what you
are seeing.</p>

<p>  There are women who make you think of pine woods coming down
to   a sparkling sea.  The air about such a woman is bracing,
and when   she is near you, you feel strong and ambitious; you
forget that   the world doesn't like you.  You think that perhaps
you are a great   fellow, after all.  Then you come away and feel
like a boy who has   fallen in love with his Sunday-school teacher. 
You'll be whipped   for it&mdash;and ought to be.</p>

<p>  There are women who make you think of Diana, crowned with the
moon.   But they do not have the "Greek profile."  I do not believe
Helen   of Troy had a "Greek profile"; they would not have fought
about her   if her nose had been quite that long.  The Greek nose
is not the   adorable nose.  The adorable nose is about an eighth
of an inch   shorter.</p>

<p>  Much of the music of Wagner, it appears, is not suitable to
the   piano.  Wagner was a composer who could interpret into music
such   things as the primitive impulses of humanity&mdash;he could
have made a   machine-shop into music.  But not if he had to work
in it.  Wagner   was always dealing in immensities&mdash;a machine-shop
would have put a   majestic lump in so grand a gizzard as that.</p>

<p>  There is a mystery about pianos, it seems.  Sometimes they
have to   be "sent away."  That is how some people speak of the
penitentiary.   "Sent away" is a euphuism for "sent to prison." 
But pianos are not   sent to prison, and they are not sent to
the tuner&mdash;the tuner is   sent to them.  Why are pianos "sent
away"&mdash;and where?</p>

<p>  Sometimes a glorious day shines into the most ordinary and
useless   life.  Happiness and beauty come caroling out of the
air into the   gloomy house of that life as if some stray angel
just happened to   perch on the roof-tree, resting and singing. 
And the night after   such a day is lustrous and splendid with
the memory of it.  Music   and beauty and kindness&mdash;those are
the three greatest things God   can give us.  To bring them all
in one day to one who expected   nothing&mdash;ah! the heart  that
received them should be as humble as   it is thankful.  But it
is hard  to be humble when one is so rich   with new memories. 
It is impossible to be humble after a day of   glory.</p>

<p>  Yes&mdash;the adorable nose is more than an eighth of an inch shorter  
than the Greek nose.  It is a full quarter of an inch shorter.</p>

<p>  There are women who will be kinder to a sick tramp than to
a   conquering hero.  But the sick tramp had better remember that's  
what he is.  Take care, take care!  Humble's the word!</p>
