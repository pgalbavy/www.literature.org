<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Owen Davies tramped along the cliff with a light heart. The wild lashing
of the rain and the roaring of the wind did not disturb him in the
least. They were disagreeable, but he accepted them as he accepted
existence and all its vanities, without remark or mental comment. There
is a class of mind of which this is the prevailing attitude. Very
early in their span of life, those endowed with such a mind come to the
conclusion that the world is too much for them. They cannot understand
it, so they abandon the attempt, and, as a consequence, in their own
torpid way they are among the happiest and most contented of men.
Problems, on which persons of keener intelligence and more aspiring soul
fret and foam their lives away as rushing water round a rock, do not
even break the placid surface of their days. Such men slip past them.
They look out upon the stars and read of the mystery of the universe
speeding on for ever through the limitless wastes of space, and are not
astonished. In their childhood they were taught that God made the sun
and the stars to give light on the earth; that is enough for them. And
so it is with everything. Poverty and suffering; war, pestilence, and
the inequalities of fate; madness, life and death, and the spiritual
wonders that hedge in our being, are things not to be inquired into but
accepted. So they accept them as they do their dinner or a tradesman’s
circular.
</p><p>In some cases this mental state has its root in deep and simple
religious convictions, and in some it springs from a preponderance
of healthful animal instincts over the higher but more troublesome
spiritual parts. The ox chewing the cud in the fresh meadow does not
muse upon the past and future, and the gull blown like a foam-flake out
against the sunset, does not know the splendour of the sky and sea.
Even the savage is not much troubled about the scheme of things. In the
beginning he was “torn out of the reeds,” and in the end he melts into
the Unknown, and for the rest, there are beef and wives, and foes to
conquer. But then oxen and gulls are not, so far as we know, troubled
with any spiritual parts at all, and in the noble savage such things are
not cultivated. They come with civilization.
</p><p>But perhaps in the majority this condition, so necessary to the more
placid forms of happiness, is born of a conjunction of physical and
religious developments. So it was, at least, with the rich and fortunate
man whom we have seen trudging along the wind-swept cliff. By nature and
education he was of a strongly and simply religious mind, as he was in
body powerful, placid, and healthy to an exasperating degree. It may be
said that it is easy to be religious and placid on ten thousand a year,
but Owen Davies had not always enjoyed ten thousand a year and one of
the most romantic and beautiful seats in Wales. From the time he was
seventeen, when his mother’s death left him an orphan, till he reached
the age of thirty, some six years from the date of the opening of this
history, he led about as hard a life as fate could find for any man.
Some people may have heard of sugar drogers, or sailing brigs, which
trade between this country and the West Indies, carrying coal outwards
and sugar home.
</p><p>On board one of these, Owen Davies worked in various capacities for
thirteen long years. He did his drudgery well; but he made no friends,
and always remained the same shy, silent, and pious man. Then suddenly
a relation died without a will, and he found himself heir-in-law to
Bryngelly Castle and all its revenues. Owen expressed no surprise, and
to all appearance felt none. He had never seen his relation, and never
dreamed of this romantic devolution of great estates upon himself.
But he accepted the good fortune as he had accepted the ill, and said
nothing. The only people who knew him were his shipmates, and they could
scarcely be held to know him. They were acquainted with his appearance
and the sound of his voice, and his method of doing his duty. Also, they
were aware, although he never spoke of religion, that he read a chapter
of the Bible every evening, and went to church whenever they touched at
a port. But of his internal self they were in total ignorance. This
did not, however, prevent them from prophesying that Davies was a “deep
one,” who, now that he had got the cash, would “blue it” in a way which
would astonish them.
</p><p>But Davies did not “excel in azure feats.” The news of his good
fortune reached him just as the brig, on which he was going to sail as
first-mate, was taking in her cargo for the West Indies. He had signed
his contract for the voyage, and, to the utter astonishment of the
lawyer who managed the estates, he announced that he should carry it
out. In vain did the man of affairs point out to his client that with
the help of a cheque of £100 he could arrange the matter for him in
ten minutes. Mr. Davies merely replied that the property could wait,
he should go the voyage and retire afterwards. The lawyer held up his
hands, and then suddenly remembered that there are women in the West
Indies as in other parts of the world. Doubtless his queer client had an
object in this voyage. As a matter of fact, he was totally wrong. Owen
Davies had never interchanged a tender word with a woman in his life; he
was a creature of routine, and it was part of his routine to carry out
his agreements to the letter. That was all.
</p><p>As a last resource, the lawyer suggested that Mr. Davies should make a
will.
</p><p>“I do not think it necessary,” was the slow and measured answer. “The
property has come to me by chance. If I die, it may as well go to
somebody else in the same way.”
</p><p>The lawyer stared. “Very well,” he said; “it is against my advice, but
you must please yourself. Do you want any money?”
</p><p>Owen thought for a moment. “Yes,” he said, “I think I should like
to have ten pounds. They are building a theatre there, and I want to
subscribe to it.”
</p><p>The lawyer gave him the ten pounds without a word; he was struck
speechless, and in this condition he remained for some minutes after
the door had closed behind his client. Then he sprung up with a single
ejaculation, “Mad, mad! like his great uncle!”
</p><p>But Owen Davies was not in the least mad, at any rate not then; he was
only a creature of habit. In due course, his agreement fulfilled, he
sailed his brig home from the West Indies (for the captain was drowned
in a gale). Then he took a second-class ticket to Bryngelly, where he
had never been in his life before, and asked his way to the Castle. He
was told to go to the beach, and he would see it. He did so, leaving his
sea-chest behind him, and there, about two hundred paces from the land,
and built upon a solitary mountain of rock, measuring half a mile or
so round the base, he perceived a vast mediæval pile of fortified
buildings, with turrets towering three hundred feet into the air, and
edged with fire by the setting sun. He gazed on it with perplexity.
Could it be that this enormous island fortress belonged to him, and, if
so, how on earth did one get to it? For some little time he walked
up and down, wondering, too shy to go to the village for information.
Meanwhile, though he did not notice her, a well-grown girl of about
fifteen, remarkable for her great grey eyes and the promise of her
beauty, was watching his evident perplexity from a seat beneath a rock,
not without amusement. At last she rose, and, with the confidence of
bold fifteen, walked straight up to him.
</p><p>“Do you want to get the Castle, sir?” she asked in a low sweet voice,
the echoes of which Owen Davies never forgot.
</p><p>“Yes--oh, I beg your pardon,” for now for the first time he saw that he
was talking to a young lady.
</p><p>“Then I am afraid that you are too late--Mrs. Thomas will not show
people over after four o’clock. She is the housekeeper, you know.”
</p><p>“Ah, well, the fact is I did not come to see over the place. I came to
live there. I am Owen Davies, and the place was left to me.”
</p><p>Beatrice, for of course it was she, stared at him in amazement. So this
was the mysterious sailor about whom there had been so much talk in
Bryngelly.
</p><p>“Oh!” she said, with embarrassing frankness. “What an odd way to come
home. Well, it is high tide, and you will have to take a boat. I will
show you where you can get one. Old Edward will row you across for
sixpence,” and she led the way round a corner of the beach to where old
Edward sat, from early morn to dewy eve, upon the thwarts of his biggest
boat, seeking those whom he might row.
</p><p>“Edward,” said the young lady, “here is the new squire, Mr. Owen Davies,
who wants to be rowed across to the Castle.” Edward, a gnarled and
twisted specimen of the sailor tribe, with small eyes and a face that
reminded the observer of one of those quaint countenances on the handle
of a walking stick, stared at her in astonishment, and then cast a look
of suspicion on the visitor.
</p><p>“Have he got papers of identification about him, miss?” he asked in a
stage whisper.
</p><p>“I don’t know,” she answered laughing. “He says that he is Mr. Owen
Davies.”
</p><p>“Well, praps he is and praps he ain’t; anyway, it isn’t my affair, and
sixpence is sixpence.”
</p><p>All of this the unfortunate Mr. Davies overheard, and it did not add to
his equanimity.
</p><p>“Now, sir, if you please,” said Edward sternly, as he pulled the little
boat up to the edge of the breakwater. A vision of Mrs. Thomas shot into
Owen’s mind. If the boatman did not believe in him, what chance had he
with the housekeeper? He wished he had brought the lawyer down with him,
and then he wished that he was back in the sugar brig.
</p><p>“Now, sir,” said Edward still more sternly, putting down his hesitation
to an impostor’s consciousness of guilt.
</p><p>“Um!” said Owen to the young lady, “I beg your pardon. I don’t even know
your name, and I am sure I have no right to ask it, but would you mind
rowing across with me? It would be so kind of you; you might introduce
me to the housekeeper.”
</p><p>Again Beatrice laughed the merry laugh of girlhood; she was too young to
be conscious of any impropriety in the situation, and indeed there was
none. But her sense of humour told her that it was funny, and she became
possessed with a not unnatural curiosity to see the thing out.
</p><p>“Oh, very well,” she said, “I will come.”
</p><p>The boat was pushed off and very soon they reached the stone quay that
bordered the harbour of the Castle, about which a little village of
retainers had grown up. Seeing the boat arrive, some of these people
sauntered out of the cottages, and then, thinking that a visitor had
come, under the guidance of Miss Beatrice, to look at the antiquities
of the Castle, which was the show place of the neighbourhood, sauntered
back again. Then the pair began the zigzag ascent of the rock mountain,
till at last they stood beneath the mighty mass of building, which,
although it was hoary with antiquity, was by no means lacking in the
comforts of modern civilization, the water, for instance, being brought
in pipes laid beneath the sea from a mountain top two miles away on the
mainland.
</p><p>“Isn’t there a view here?” said Beatrice, pointing to the vast stretch
of land and sea. “I think, Mr. Davies, that you have the most beautiful
house in the whole world. Your great-uncle, who died a year ago, spent
more than fifty thousand pounds on repairing and refurbishing it, they
say. He built the big drawing-room there, where the stone is a little
lighter; it is fifty-five feet long. Just think, fifty thousand pounds!”
</p><p>“It is a large sum,” said Owen, in an unimaginative sort of way, while
in his heart he wondered what on earth he should do with this white
elephant of a mediæval castle, and its drawing room fifty-five feet
long.
</p><p>“He does not seem much impressed,” thought Beatrice to herself, as she
tugged away at the postern bell; “I think he must be stupid. He looks
stupid.”
</p><p>Presently the door was opened by an active-looking little old woman with
a high voice.
</p><p>“Mrs. Thomas,” thought Owen to himself; “she is even worse than I
expected.”
</p><p>“Now you must please to go away,” began the formidable housekeeper in
her shrillest key; “it is too late to show visitors over. Why, bless us,
it’s you, Miss Beatrice, with a strange man! What do you want?”
</p><p>Beatrice looked at her companion as a hint that he should explain
himself, but he said nothing.
</p><p>“This is your new squire,” she said, not without a certain pride. “I
found him wandering about the beach. He did not know how to get here, so
I brought him over.”
</p><p>“Lord, Miss Beatrice, and how do you know it’s him?” said Mrs. Thomas.
“How do you know it ain’t a housebreaker?”
</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure he cannot be,” answered Beatrice aside, “because he isn’t
clever enough.”
</p><p>Then followed a long discussion. Mrs. Thomas stoutly refused to admit
the stranger without evidence of identity, and Beatrice, embracing his
cause, as stoutly pressed his claims. As for the lawful owner, he made
occasional feeble attempts to prove that he was himself, but Mrs. Thomas
was not to be imposed upon in this way. At last they came to a dead
lock.
</p><p>“Y’d better go back to the inn, sir,” said Mrs. Thomas with scathing
sarcasm, “and come up to-morrow with proofs and your luggage.”
</p><p>“Haven’t you got any letters with you?” suggested Beatrice as a last
resource.
</p><p>As it happened Owen had a letter, one from the lawyer to himself about
the property, and mentioning Mrs. Thomas’s name as being in charge
of the Castle. He had forgotten all about it, but at this interesting
juncture it was produced and read aloud by Beatrice. Mrs. Thomas took
it, and having examined it carefully through her horn-rimmed spectacles,
was constrained to admit its authenticity.
</p><p>“I’m sure I apologise, sir,” she said with a half-doubtful courtesy
and much tact, “but one can’t be too careful with all these trampseses
about; I never should have thought from the look of you, sir, how as you
was the new squire.”
</p><p>This might be candid, but it was not flattering, and it caused Beatrice
to snigger behind her handkerchief in true school-girl fashion. However,
they entered, and were led by Mrs. Thomas with solemn pomp through
the great and little halls, the stone parlour and the oak parlour, the
library and the huge drawing-room, in which the white heads of marble
statues protruded from the bags of brown holland wherewith they were
wrapped about in a manner ghastly to behold. At length they reached a
small octagon-shaped room that, facing south, commanded a most glorious
view of sea and land. It was called the Lady’s Boudoir, and joined
another of about the same size, which in its former owner’s time had
been used as a smoking-room.
</p><p>“If you don’t mind, madam,” said the lord of all this magnificence, “I
should like to stop here, I am getting tired of walking.” And there he
stopped for many years. The rest of the Castle was shut up; he scarcely
ever visited it except occasionally to see that the rooms were properly
aired, for he was a methodical man.
</p><p>As for Beatrice, she went home, still chuckling, to receive a severe
reproof from Elizabeth for her “forwardness.” But Owen Davies never
forgot the debt of gratitude he owed her. In his heart he felt convinced
that had it not been for her, he would have fled before Mrs. Thomas and
her horn-rimmed eyeglasses, to return no more. The truth of the matter
was, however, that young as was Beatrice, he fell in love with her then
and there, only to fall deeper and deeper into that drear abyss as years
went on. He never said anything about it, he scarcely even gave a hint
of his hopeless condition, though of course Beatrice divined something
of it as soon as she came to years of discretion. But there grew up in
Owen’s silent, lonely breast a great and overmastering desire to make
this grey-eyed girl his wife. He measured time by the intervals that
elapsed between his visions of her. No period in his life was so
wretched and utterly purposeless as those two years which passed while
she was at her Training College. He was a very passive lover, as yet his
gathering passion did not urge him to extremes, and he could never make
up his mind to declare it. The box was in his hand, but he feared to
throw the dice.
</p><p>But he drew as near to her as he dared. Once he gave Beatrice a flower,
it was when she was seventeen, and awkwardly expressed a hope that she
would wear it for his sake. The words were not much and the flower was
not much, but there was a look about the man’s eyes, and a suppressed
passion and energy in his voice, which told their tale to the
keen-witted girl. After this he found that she avoided him, and bitterly
regretted his boldness. For Beatrice did not like him in that way. To
a girl of her curious stamp his wealth was nothing. She did not covet
wealth, she coveted independence, and had the sense to know that
marriage with such a man would not bring it. A cage is a cage, whether
the bars are of iron or gold. He bored her, she despised him for his
want of intelligence and enterprise. That a man with all this wealth and
endless opportunity should waste his life in such fashion was to her a
thing intolerable. She knew if she had half his chance, that she would
make her name ring from one end of Europe to the other. In short,
Beatrice held Owen as deeply in contempt as her sister Elizabeth,
studying him from another point of view, held him in reverence. And
putting aside any human predilections, Beatrice would never have married
a man whom she despised. She respected herself too much.
</p><p>Owen Davies saw all this as through a glass darkly, and in his own slow
way cast about for a means of drawing near. He discovered that Beatrice
was passionately fond of learning, and also that she had no means to
obtain the necessary books. So he threw open his library to her; it
was one of the best in Wales. He did more; he gave orders to a London
bookseller to forward him every new book of importance that appeared
in certain classes of literature, and all of these he placed at her
disposal, having first carefully cut the leaves with his own hand. This
was a bait Beatrice could not resist. She might dread or even detest Mr.
Davies, but she loved his books, and if she quarrelled with him her
well of knowledge would simply run dry, for there were no circulating
libraries at Bryngelly, and if there had been she could not have
afforded to subscribe to them. So she remained on good terms with him,
and even smiled at his futile attempts to keep pace with her studies.
Poor man, reading did not come naturally to him; he was much better at
cutting leaves. He studied the <u>Times</u> and certain religious works, that
was all. But he wrestled manfully with many a detested tome, in order to
be able to say something to Beatrice about it, and the worst of it was
that Beatrice always saw through it, and showed him that she did. It was
not kind, perhaps, but youth is cruel.
</p><p>And so the years wore on, till at length Beatrice knew that a crisis
was at hand. Even the tardiest and most retiring lover must come to the
point at last, if he is in earnest, and Owen Davies was very much in
earnest. Of late, to her dismay, he had so far come out of his shell
as to allow himself to be nominated a member of the school council. Of
course she knew that this was only to give him more opportunities of
seeing her. As a member of the council, he could visit the school of
which she was mistress as often as he chose, and indeed he soon learned
to take a lively interest in village education. About twice a week he
would come in just as the school was breaking up and offer to walk home
with her, seeking for a favourable opportunity to propose. Hitherto she
had always warded off this last event, but she knew that it must happen.
Not that she was actually afraid of the man himself; he was too much
afraid of her for that. What she did fear was the outburst of wrath
from her father and sister when they learned that she had refused Owen
Davies. It never occurred to her that Elizabeth might be playing a hand
of her own in the matter.
</p><p>From all of which it will be clear, if indeed it has not become so
already, that Beatrice Granger was a somewhat ill-regulated young woman,
born to bring trouble on herself and all connected with her. Had she
been otherwise, she would have taken her good fortune and married Owen
Davies, in which case her history need never have been written.
