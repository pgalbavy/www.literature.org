<p>"Beware!"</p>

<p>The tremulous effort and the broken, inadequate tone of the faint
cry, surprised Lingard more than the unexpected suddenness of
the warning conveyed, he did not know by whom and to whom. Besides
himself there was no one in the courtyard as far as he could see.</p>

<p>The cry was not renewed, and his watchful eyes, scanning warily
the misty solitude of Willems’ enclosure, were met everywhere
only by the stolid impassiveness of inanimate things: the big
sombre-looking tree, the shut-up, sightless house, the glistening
bamboo fences, the damp and drooping bushes further off&mdash;all these
things, that condemned to look for ever at the incomprehensible
afflictions or joys of mankind, assert in their aspect of cold
unconcern the high dignity of lifeless matter that surrounds,
incurious and unmoved, the restless mysteries of the ever-changing,
of the never-ending life.</p>

<p>Lingard, stepping aside, put the trunk of the tree between himself
and the house, then, moving cautiously round one of the projecting
buttresses, had to tread short in order to avoid scattering a
small heap of black embers upon which he came unexpectedly on
the other side. A thin, wizened, little old woman, who, standing
behind the tree, had been looking at the house, turned towards
him with a start, gazed with faded, expressionless eyes at the
intruder, then made a limping attempt to get away. She seemed,
however, to realize directly the hopelessness or the difficulty
of the undertaking, stopped, hesitated, tottered back slowly;
then, after blinking dully, fell suddenly on her knees amongst
the white ashes, and, bending over the heap of smouldering coals,
distended her sunken cheeks in a steady effort to blow up the
hidden sparks into a useful blaze. Lingard looked down on her,
but she seemed to have made up her mind that there was not enough
life left in her lean body for anything else than the discharge
of the simple domestic duty, and, apparently, she begrudged him
the least moment of attention.</p>

<p>After waiting for awhile, Lingard asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why did you call, O daughter?"</p>

<p>"I saw you enter," she croaked feebly, still grovelling with
her face near the ashes and without looking up, "and I called&mdash;the
cry of warning. It was her order. Her order," she repeated, with
a moaning sigh.</p>

<p>"And did she hear?" pursued Lingard, with gentle composure.</p>

<p>Her projecting shoulder-blades moved uneasily under the thin
stuff of the tight body jacket. She scrambled up with difficulty
to her feet, and hobbled away, muttering peevishly to herself,
towards a pile of dry brushwood heaped up against the fence.</p>

<p>Lingard, looking idly after her, heard the rattle of loose planks
that led from the ground to the door of the house. He moved his
head beyond the shelter of the tree and saw Aissa coming down
the inclined way into the courtyard. After making a few hurried
paces towards the tree, she stopped with one foot advanced in
an appearance of sudden terror, and her eyes glanced wildly right
and left. Her head was uncovered. A blue cloth wrapped her from
her head to foot in close slanting folds, with one end thrown
over her shoulder. A tress of her black hair strayed across her
bosom. Her bare arms pressed down close to her body, with hands
open and outstretched fingers; her slightly elevated shoulders
and the backward inclination of her torso gave her the aspect
of one defiant yet shrinking from a coming blow. She had closed
the door of the house behind her; and as she stood solitary in
the unnatural and threatening twilight of the murky day, with
everything unchanged around her, she appeared to Lingard as if
she had been made there, on the spot, out of the black vapours
of the sky and of the sinister gleams of feeble sunshine that
struggled, through the thickening clouds, into the colourless
desolation of the world.</p>

<p>After a short but attentive glance towards the shut-up house,
Lingard stepped out from behind the tree and advanced slowly towards
her. The sudden fixity of her&mdash;till then&mdash;restless eyes and a
slight twitch of her hands were the only signs she gave at first
of having seen him. She made a long stride forward, and putting
herself right in his path, stretched her arms across; her black
eyes opened wide, her lips parted as if in an uncertain attempt
to speak&mdash;but no sound came out to break the significant silence
of their meeting. Lingard stopped and looked at her with stern
curiosity. After a while he said composedly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me pass. I came here to talk to a man. Does he hide? Has
he sent you?"</p>

<p>She made a step nearer, her arms fell by her side, then she put
them straight out nearly touching Lingard’s breast.</p>

<p>"He knows not fear," she said, speaking low, with a forward throw
of her head, in a voice trembling but distinct. "It is my own
fear that has sent me here. He sleeps."</p>

<p>"He has slept long enough," said Lingard, in measured tones.
"I am come&mdash;and now is the time of his waking. Go and tell him
this&mdash;or else my own voice will call him up. A voice he knows
well."</p>

<p>He put her hands down firmly and again made as if to pass by
her.</p>

<p>"Do not!" she exclaimed, and fell at his feet as if she had been
cut down by a scythe. The unexpected suddenness of her movement
startled Lingard, who stepped back.</p>

<p>"What’s this?" he exclaimed in a wondering whisper&mdash;then added
in a tone of sharp command: "Stand up!"</p>

<p>She rose at once and stood looking at him, timorous and fearless;
yet with a fire of recklessness burning in her eyes that made
clear her resolve to pursue her purpose even to the death. Lingard
went on in a severe voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go out of my path. You are Omar’s daughter, and you ought to
know that when men meet in daylight women must be silent and abide
their fate."</p>

<p>"Women!" she retorted, with subdued vehemence. "Yes, I am a woman!
Your eyes see that, O Rajah Laut, but can you see my life? I also
have heard&mdash;O man of many fights &mdash;I also have heard the
voice of fire-arms; I also have felt the rain of young twigs and
of leaves cut up by bullets fall down about my head; I also know
how to look in silence at angry faces and at strong hands raised
high grasping sharp steel. I also saw men fall dead around me
without a cry of fear and of mourning; and I have watched the
sleep of weary fugitives, and looked at night shadows full of
menace and death with eyes that knew nothing but watchfulness.
And," she went on, with a mournful drop in her voice, "I have
faced the heartless sea, held on my lap the heads of those who
died raving from thirst, and from their cold hands took the paddle
and worked so that those with me did not know that one man more
was dead. I did all this. What more have you done? That was my
life. What has been yours?"</p>

<p>The matter and the manner of her speech held Lingard motionless,
attentive and approving against his will. She ceased speaking,
and from her staring black eyes with a narrow border of white
above and below, a double ray of her very soul streamed out in
a fierce desire to light up the most obscure designs of his heart.
After a long silence, which served to emphasize the meaning of
her words, she added in the whisper of bitter regret&mdash;</p>

<p>"And I have knelt at your feet! And I am afraid!"</p>

<p>"You," said Lingard deliberately, and returning her look with
an interested gaze, "you are a woman whose heart, I believe, is
great enough to fill a man’s breast: but still you are a woman,
and to you, I, Rajah Laut, have nothing to say."</p>

<p>She listened bending her head in a movement of forced attention;
and his voice sounded to her unexpected, far off, with the distant
and unearthly ring of voices that we hear in dreams, saying faintly
things startling, cruel or absurd, to which there is no possible
reply. To her he had nothing to say! She wrung her hands, glanced
over the courtyard with that eager and distracted look that sees
nothing, then looked up at the hopeless sky of livid grey and
drifting black; at the unquiet mourning of the hot and brilliant
heaven that had seen the beginning of her love, that had heard
his entreaties and her answers, that had seen his desire and her
fear; that had seen her joy, her surrender&mdash;and his defeat. Lingard
moved a little, and this slight stir near her precipitated her
disordered and shapeless thoughts into hurried words.</p>

<p>"Wait!" she exclaimed in a stifled voice, and went on disconnectedly
and rapidly&mdash;"Stay. I have heard. Men often spoke by the fires
. . . men of my people. And they said of you&mdash;the first on the
sea&mdash;they said that to men’s cries you were deaf in battle, but
after . . . No! even while you fought, your ears were open to
the voice of children and women. They said . . . that. Now I,
a woman, I . . ."</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly and stood before him with dropped eyelids
and parted lips, so still now that she seemed to have been changed
into a breathless, an unhearing, an unseeing figure, without knowledge
of fear or hope, of anger or despair. In the astounding repose
that came on her face, nothing moved but the delicate nostrils
that expanded and collapsed quickly, flutteringly, in interrupted
beats, like the wings of a snared bird.</p>

<p>"I am white," said Lingard, proudly, looking at her with a steady
gaze where simple curiosity was giving way to a pitying annoyance,
"and men you have heard, spoke only what is true over the evening
fires. My ears are open to your prayer. But listen to me before
you speak. For yourself you need not be afraid. You can come even
now with me and you shall find refuge in the household of Syed
Abdulla&mdash;who is of your own faith. And this also you must know:
nothing that you may say will change my purpose towards the man
who is sleeping&mdash;or hiding&mdash;in that house."</p>

<p>Again she gave him the look that was like a stab, not of anger
but of desire; of the intense, over-powering desire to see in,
to see through, to understand everything: every thought, emotion,
purpose; every impulse, every hesitation inside that man; inside
that white-clad foreign being who looked at her, who spoke to
her, who breathed before her like any other man, but bigger, red-faced,
white-haired and mysterious. It was the future clothed in flesh;
the to-morrow; the day after; all the days, all the years of her
life standing there before her alive and secret, with all their
good or evil shut up within the breast of that man; of that man
who could be persuaded, cajoled, entreated, perhaps touched, worried;
frightened&mdash;who knows?&mdash;if only first he could be understood!
She had seen a long time ago whither events were tending. She
had noted the contemptuous yet menacing coldness of Abdulla; she
had heard&mdash;alarmed yet unbelieving &mdash;Babalatchi’s gloomy
hints, covert allusions and veiled suggestions to abandon the
useless white man whose fate would be the price of the peace secured
by the wise and good who had no need of him any more. And he&mdash;himself!
She clung to him. There was nobody else. Nothing else. She would
try to cling to him always&mdash;all the life! And yet he was far from
her. Further every day. Every day he seemed more distant, and
she followed him patiently, hopefully, blindly, but steadily,
through all the devious wanderings of his mind. She followed as
well as she could. Yet at times&mdash;very often lately&mdash;she had felt
lost like one strayed in the thickets of tangled undergrowth of
a great forest. To her the ex-clerk of old Hudig appeared as remote,
as brilliant, as terrible, as necessary, as the sun that gives
life to these lands: the sun of unclouded skies that dazzles and
withers; the sun beneficent and wicked&mdash;the giver of light, perfume,
and pestilence. She had watched him&mdash;watched him close; fascinated
by love, fascinated by danger. He was alone now&mdash;but for her;
and she saw&mdash;she thought she saw&mdash;that he was like a man afraid
of something. Was it possible? He afraid? Of what? Was it of that
old white man who was coming&mdash;who had come? Possibly. She had
heard of that man ever since she could remember. The bravest were
afraid of him! And now what was in the mind of this old, old man
who looked so strong? What was he going to do with the light of
her life? Put it out? Take it away? Take it away for ever!&mdash;for
ever!&mdash;and leave her in darkness:&mdash;not in the stirring, whispering,
expectant night in which the hushed world awaits the return of
sunshine; but in the night without end, the night of the grave,
where nothing breathes, nothing moves, nothing thinks&mdash;the last
darkness of cold and silence without hope of another sunrise.</p>

<p>She cried&mdash;"Your purpose! You know nothing. I must . . ."</p>

<p>He interrupted&mdash;unreasonably excited, as if she had, by her look,
inoculated him with some of her own distress.</p>

<p>"I know enough."</p>

<p>She approached, and stood facing him at arm’s length, with both
her hands on his shoulders; and he, surprised by that audacity,
closed and opened his eyes two or three times, aware of some emotion
arising within him, from her words, her tone, her contact; an
emotion unknown, singular, penetrating and sad&mdash;at the close sight
of that strange woman, of that being savage and tender, strong
and delicate, fearful and resolute, that had got entangled so
fatally between their two lives&mdash;his own and that other white
man’s, the abominable scoundrel.</p>

<p>"How can you know?" she went on, in a persuasive tone that seemed
to flow out of her very heart&mdash;"how can you know? I live with
him all the days. All the nights. I look at him; I see his every
breath, every glance of his eye, every movement of his lips. I
see nothing else! What else is there? And even I do not understand.
I do not understand him!&mdash;Him! &mdash;My life! Him who to me is
so great that his presence hides the earth and the water from
my sight!"</p>

<p>Lingard stood straight, with his hands deep in the pockets of
his jacket. His eyes winked quickly, because she spoke very close
to his face. She disturbed him and he had a sense of the efforts
he was making to get hold of her meaning, while all the time he
could not help telling himself that all this was of no use.</p>

<p>She added after a pause&mdash;"There has been a time when I could
understand him. When I knew what was in his mind better than he
knew it himself. When I felt him. When I held him. . . . And now
he has escaped."</p>

<p>"Escaped? What? Gone away!" shouted Lingard.</p>

<p>"Escaped from me," she said; "left me alone. Alone. And I am
ever near him. Yet alone."</p>

<p>Her hands slipped slowly off Lingard’s shoulders and her arms
fell by her side, listless, discouraged, as if to her&mdash;to her,
the savage, violent, and ignorant creature&mdash;had been revealed
clearly in that moment the tremendous fact of our isolation, of
the loneliness impenetrable and transparent, elusive and everlasting;
of the indestructible loneliness that surrounds, envelopes, clothes
every human soul from the cradle to the grave, and, perhaps, beyond.</p>

<p>"Aye! Very well! I understand. His face is turned away from you,"
said Lingard. "Now, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"I want . . . I have looked&mdash;for help . . . everywhere . . .
against men. . . . All men . . . I do not know. First they came,
the invisible whites, and dealt death from afar . . . then he
came. He came to me who was alone and sad. He came; angry with
his brothers; great amongst his own people; angry with those I
have not seen: with the people where men have no mercy and women
have no shame. He was of them, and great amongst them. For he
was great?"</p>

<p>Lingard shook his head slightly. She frowned at him, and went
on in disordered haste&mdash;</p>

<p>"Listen. I saw him. I have lived by the side of brave men . .
. of chiefs. When he came I was the daughter of a beggar&mdash;of a
blind man without strength and hope. He spoke to me as if I had
been brighter than the sunshine&mdash;more delightful than the cool
water of the brook by which we met&mdash;more . . ." Her anxious eyes
saw some shade of expression pass on her listener’s face that
made her hold her breath for a second, and then explode into pained
fury so violent that it drove Lingard back a pace, like an unexpected
blast of wind. He lifted both his hands, incongruously paternal
in his venerable aspect, bewildered and soothing, while she stretched
her neck forward and shouted at him.</p>

<p>"I tell you I was all that to him. I know it! I saw it! . . .
There are times when even you white men speak the truth. I saw
his eyes. I felt his eyes, I tell you! I saw him tremble when
I came near&mdash;when I spoke&mdash;when I touched him. Look at me! You
have been young. Look at me. Look, Rajah Laut!"</p>

<p>She stared at Lingard with provoking fixity, then, turning her
head quickly, she sent over her shoulder a glance, full of humble
fear, at the house that stood high behind her back&mdash;dark, closed,
rickety and silent on its crooked posts.</p>

<p>Lingard’s eyes followed her look, and remained gazing expectantly
at the house. After a minute or so he muttered, glancing at her
suspiciously&mdash;</p>

<p>"If he has not heard your voice now, then he must be far away&mdash;or
dead."</p>

<p>"He is there," she whispered, a little calmed but still anxious&mdash;"he
is there. For three days he waited. Waited for you night and day.
And I waited with him. I waited, watching his face, his eyes,
his lips; listening to his words.&mdash;To the words I could not understand.
&mdash;To the words he spoke in daylight; to the words he spoke
at night in his short sleep. I listened. He spoke to himself walking
up and down here&mdash;by the river; by the bushes. And I followed.
I wanted to know&mdash;and I could not! He was tormented by things
that made him speak in the words of his own people. Speak to himself&mdash;not
to me. Not to me! What was he saying? What was he going to do?
Was he afraid of you? &mdash;Of death? What was in his heart?
. . . Fear? . . . Or anger? . . . what desire? . . . what sadness?
He spoke; spoke; many words. All the time! And I could not know!
I wanted to speak to him. He was deaf to me. I followed him everywhere,
watching for some word I could understand; but his mind was in
the land of his people&mdash;away from me. When I touched him he was
angry&mdash;so!"</p>

<p>She imitated the movement of some one shaking off roughly an
importunate hand, and looked at Lingard with tearful and unsteady
eyes.</p>

<p>After a short interval of laboured panting, as if she had been
out of breath with running or fighting, she looked down and went
on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Day after day, night after night, I lived watching him&mdash;seeing
nothing. And my heart was heavy&mdash;heavy with the presence of death
that dwelt amongst us. I could not believe. I thought he was afraid.
Afraid of you! Then I, myself, knew fear. . . . Tell me, Rajah
Laut, do you know the fear without voice&mdash;the fear of silence&mdash;the
fear that comes when there is no one near&mdash;when there is no battle,
no cries, no angry faces or armed hands anywhere? . . . The fear
from which there is no escape!"</p>

<p>She paused, fastened her eyes again on the puzzled Lingard, and
hurried on in a tone of despair&mdash;</p>

<p>"And I knew then he would not fight you! Before&mdash;many days ago
&mdash;I went away twice to make him obey my desire; to make him
strike at his own people so that he could be mine&mdash;mine! O calamity!
His hand was false as your white hearts. It struck forward, pushed
by my desire&mdash;by his desire of me. . . . It struck that strong
hand, and &mdash;O shame!&mdash;it killed nobody! Its fierce and lying
blow woke up hate without any fear. Round me all was lies. His
strength was a lie. My own people lied to me and to him. And to
meet you&mdash;you, the great!&mdash;he had no one but me? But me with my
rage, my pain, my weakness. Only me! And to me he would not even
speak. The fool!"</p>

<p>She came up close to Lingard, with the wild and stealthy aspect
of a lunatic longing to whisper out an insane secret&mdash;one of those
misshapen, heart-rending, and ludicrous secrets; one of those
thoughts that, like monsters&mdash;cruel, fantastic, and mournful,
wander about terrible and unceasing in the night of madness. Lingard
looked at her, astounded but unflinching. She spoke in his face,
very low.</p>

<p>"He is all! Everything. He is my breath, my light, my heart.
. . . Go away. . . . Forget him. . . . He has no courage and no
wisdom any more . . . and I have lost my power. . . . Go away
and forget. There are other enemies. . . . Leave him to me. He
had been a man once. . . . You are too great. Nobody can withstand
you. . . . I tried. . . . I know now . . . . I cry for mercy.
Leave him to me and go away."</p>

<p>The fragments of her supplicating sentences were as if tossed
on the crest of her sobs. Lingard, outwardly impassive, with his
eyes fixed on the house, experienced that feeling of condemnation,
deep-seated, persuasive, and masterful; that illogical impulse
of disapproval which is half disgust, half vague fear, and that
wakes up in our hearts in the presence of anything new or unusual,
of anything that is not run into the mould of our own conscience;
the accursed feeling made up of disdain, of anger, and of the
sense of superior virtue that leaves us deaf, blind, contemptuous
and stupid before anything which is not like ourselves.</p>

<p>He answered, not looking at her at first, but speaking towards
the house that fascinated him&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> go away! He wanted me to come&mdash;he himself did! .
. . <em>You</em> must go away. You do not know what you are asking
for. Listen. Go to your own people. Leave him. He is . . ."</p>

<p>He paused, looked down at her with his steady eyes; hesitated,
as if seeking an adequate expression; then snapped his fingers,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Finish."</p>

<p>She stepped back, her eyes on the ground, and pressed her temples
with both her hands, which she raised to her head in a slow and
ample movement full of unconscious tragedy. The tone of her words
was gentle and vibrating, like a loud meditation. She said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell the brook not to run to the river; tell the river not to
run to the sea. Speak loud. Speak angrily. Maybe they will obey
you. But it is in my mind that the brook will not care. The brook
that springs out of the hillside and runs to the great river.
He would not care for your words: he that cares not for the very
mountain that gave him life; he that tears the earth from which
he springs. Tears it, eats it, destroys it&mdash;to hurry faster to
the river&mdash;to the river in which he is lost for ever. . . . O
Rajah Laut! I do not care."</p>

<p>She drew close again to Lingard, approaching slowly, reluctantly,
as if pushed by an invisible hand, and added in words that seemed
to be torn out of her&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cared not for my own father. For him that died. I would have
rather . . . You do not know what I have done . . . I . . ."</p>

<p>"You shall have his life," said Lingard, hastily.</p>

<p>They stood together, crossing their glances; she suddenly appeased,
and Lingard thoughtful and uneasy under a vague sense of defeat.
And yet there was no defeat. He never intended to kill the fellow&mdash;not
after the first moment of anger, a long time ago. The days of
bitter wonder had killed anger; had left only a bitter indignation
and a bitter wish for complete justice. He felt discontented and
surprised. Unexpectedly he had come upon a human being&mdash;a woman
at that&mdash;who had made him disclose his will before its time. She
should have his life. But she must be told, she must know, that
for such men as Willems there was no favour and no grace.</p>

<p>"Understand," he said slowly, "that I leave him his life not
in mercy but in punishment."</p>

<p>She started, watched every word on his lips, and after he finished
speaking she remained still and mute in astonished immobility.
A single big drop of rain, a drop enormous, pellucid and heavy&mdash;like
a super-human tear coming straight and rapid from above, tearing
its way through the sombre sky&mdash;struck loudly the dry ground between
them in a starred splash. She wrung her hands in the bewilderment
of the new and incomprehensible fear. The anguish of her whisper
was more piercing than the shrillest cry.</p>

<p>"What punishment! Will you take him away then? Away from me?
Listen to what I have done. . . . It is I who . . ."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Lingard, who had been looking at the house.</p>

<p>"Don’t you believe her, Captain Lingard," shouted Willems from
the doorway, where he appeared with swollen eyelids and bared
breast. He stood for a while, his hands grasping the lintels on
each side of the door, and writhed about, glaring wildly, as if
he had been crucified there. Then he made a sudden rush head foremost
down the plankway that responded with hollow, short noises to
every footstep.</p>

<p>She heard him. A slight thrill passed on her face and the words
that were on her lips fell back unspoken into her benighted heart;
fell back amongst the mud, the stones&mdash;and the flowers, that are
at the bottom of every heart.</p>
