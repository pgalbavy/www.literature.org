<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>You have already learned something of the Nez Perces, who in
our times have produced one of the greatest Indian leaders of
the past century. He was Chief Joseph, who gave the United States
regulars such a brilliant campaign as to excite their admiration.
Perhaps you saw the aged chief on his visit to the East a short
time since. He was chivalrous, high-minded and a loyal friend
of the whites, and showed this when he handed his rifle to Colonel
Miles and said: "From where the sun stands in yonder heavens,
I fight the white man no more."</p>

<p>You will recall that the Nez Perces are large, fine-looking men,
of dark complexion, and that the women have attractive features.
A century ago they had a rough time of it. They were forced to
work hard during the summer and autumn in gathering salmon and
their winter supply of edible roots. In winter they hunted deer
on snow shoes, and, as spring advanced, crossed the mountains
to the headwaters of the Missouri to traffic in buffalo robes.
You will see, therefore, that they were kept unusually busy, and
red men have never shown a fondness for manual labor. But, beside
this, they had numerous fights with enemies from the west, often
losing some of their warriors and many of their horses.</p>

<p>At the time of the visit by our friends, Amokeat was principal
chief of the Nez Perces. He and Mul-tal-la the Blackfoot were
attached to each other, and the confidence of the latter in the
dusky leader was complete. Had he not been so warm in his expressions
of this faith in Amokeat, Deerfoot would never have left the stallion
Whirlwind in his care while the explorers were pressing their
way down the Columbia to tidewater.</p>

<p>As it was, the Shawanoe was troubled by misgivings from the hour
he parted company with his matchless steed. As the distance between
him and the Nez Perce village lessened, it was hard for the dusky
youth to suppress his nervousness. He was reserved, speaking only
now and then when necessary, and unconsciously hurrying his footsteps,
until the brothers were ready to drop from exhaustion. Had the
village been a mile farther off they would have been obliged to
beg for rest.</p>

<p>The arrival of the party caused less excitement than would be
supposed. The majority of the men and women were away, assisting
in the harvesting of salmon, while fully a score of the ablest
warriors were off somewhere in the mountains, either hunting or
scouting, preparatory to some movement the Nez Perces as a tribe
had in view. There were enough on hand, however, to give our friends
due attention and to welcome them back.</p>

<p>The first inquiry of Deerfoot was as to the horses. To the south
of the main village stretched an expanse of undergrowth, bushes,
succulent grass and herbage, where the animals of the tribe were
turned loose to roam at will when not needed by their owners.
The Nez Perces, with gestures and the few words that were understood
by Mul-tal-la, said the horses of their visitors would be found
at the place described. It was not far off, and Deerfoot broke
into a lope, his friends at his heels.</p>

<p>It required but a few minutes to reach the tract, which covered
a number of acres. At different points glimpses were caught of
horses cropping the grass and herbage. The first animal recognized
was Zigzag, who was so near that the moment the party debouched
into the space he raised his head, looked at them and gave a neigh
of recognition. Then he resumed his grazing, as if he felt that
he had done all the honors due from him.</p>

<p>"Yonder is Prince!" exclaimed Victor, running forward to greet
his horse, while George Shelton began searching hither and yon
for Jack. Mul-tal-la did not see Bug, and showed more interest
in Deerfoot's search than in his own animal.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe had halted on the edge of the pasturage ground,
glanced quickly over his field of vision, and then, placing a
thumb and forefinger between his teeth, he emitted a blast like
that of a steam whistle. It was a signal he had taught the stallion,
and he knew that if the horse was within a mile he would come
toward him on a full gallop. Deerfoot repeated the call twice
and then waited and looked and listened. None of the horses so
much as raised his head, and the heart of the youth became like
lead.</p>

<p>"Whirlwind is not here," he said sadly to the Blackfoot. George
and Victor hurried back, drawn by the signal whose meaning they
understood. In truth, when they left his side it had been more
for the purpose of hunting for the stallion than for their own
animals. Their hearts ached for Deerfoot, whose face was the picture
of disappointment and grief.</p>

<p>"Call to him again," suggested George.</p>

<p>"It can do no good. If he is near he would have heard Deerfoot;
he is gone."</p>

<p>"He may have wandered beyond reach of your signal," said Victor.
"You know he never felt friendly toward other horses and always
kept by himself."</p>

<p>With a weak hope that his friend was right, Deerfoot walked a
hundred yards to where an uprooted tree lay on its side, climbed
upon the trunk, and, facing the different points of the compass
in turn, whistled so shrilly that in the afternoon stillness the
sound awoke the echoes for miles in every direction. Then he stood
in the attitude of intense attention. Certain that the stallion
had not gone far of his own accord, he knew these calls would
bring him dashing to the spot, provided no person had had a hand
in his disappearance.</p>

<p>But the minutes passed without anything of this nature occurring,
and the Shawanoe sprang down from the slight elevation and came
back to where his sympathizing friends awaited him. They were
silent, for none could say aught to comfort him.</p>

<p>"We will look for Amokeat," he quietly remarked, leading the
way to the village. There the inquiries of Mul-tal-la brought
the first definite information of the missing horse. It was of
anything but a pleasant nature.</p>

<p>It has been said that about a score of Nez Perce warriors were
absent on a scouting or hunting expedition. They were under the
lead of Amokeat, who rode away on the back of Whirlwind. They
had been gone several days and were liable to return at any hour,
or they might be absent for a week or more longer.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot gained this information he was filled with indignation.
Without speaking, he turned his back upon his friends and walked
to and fro for several minutes. He was striving to gain control
of his emotions, and some time passed before he could do so. When
he succeeded he rejoined his comrades, several of the Nez Perces
gathering round and watching the four with no little curiosity.</p>

<p>"Amokeat did not ask Deerfoot that he might ride Whirlwind,"
said the Shawanoe, the flash not fully gone from his eyes, and
a slight tremulousness showing in his voice.</p>

<p>"He had no business to do so," added the impulsive Victor; "I
wonder that the horse allowed anyone to ride him except you."</p>

<p>George Shelton tried to soothe his troubled friend.</p>

<p>"I understand how you feel, Deerfoot, but it looks to me as if
it will come out all right. The Nez Perces rode off on their horses,
with Whirlwind in the lead. Why should they not come back the
same way, with Whirlwind none the worse? Amokeat did not expect
you for some time, and who can wonder that he wished to ride such
a steed?"</p>

<p>Deerfoot turned and looked in the face of the lad.</p>

<p>"Does my brother wish Deerfoot to sit down and fold his hands
and wait for days and weeks, all the time not knowing whether
Whirlwind will come back again or not? Does not my brother see
that there is not a day nor an hour to be wasted? Deerfoot would
die many times while waiting for Amokeat; he cannot do it."</p>

<p>This was another way of declaring that the young Shawanoe meant
to set out to recover his steed without an hour's unnecessary
delay. All felt in the circumstances that it was the best thing
to do. No one offered further suggestion. Mul-tal-la, who had
spoken hardly a word, now told Deerfoot he would find out all
that was to be learned of Amokeat and his party.</p>

<p>Left alone with the lads, the Shawanoe explained the plan he
had formed.</p>

<p>"Mul-tal-la will take my brothers to his home among the Blackfeet,
where they will stay until spring comes; winter is too near for
them to travel any farther toward the Ohio. Mul-tal-la will make
them welcome and they will not want for food and comforts."</p>

<p>"And what of <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"When Deerfoot meets Whirlwind, the two will join his brothers
and all will be together till the sun begins to melt the snow
on the sides of the mountains. Then they will set out for the
Ohio which they left so many months ago."</p>

<p>"Will you make this search for Whirlwind on horseback or on foot?"</p>

<p>"On foot; there is no horse that can help me. Whirlwind would
be offended if he saw me come after him on any other of these
animals. Deerfoot can travel better on foot than any other way."</p>

<p>"You wish us to take our horses with us to the Blackfoot country?"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe nodded.</p>

<p>"Take the four and keep them among the Blackfeet; they will be
needed by us when spring comes."</p>

<p>"You have plenty of bullets and powder. Is there anything of
ours that you would like?" asked Victor.</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;<em>that</em>; it may be of help to Deerfoot."</p>

<p>The dusky youth pointed to the spyglass suspended by a cord around
the neck of George Shelton. The owner instantly slipped the string
over his head.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to it and to anything else of ours."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot thanks his brothers, but there is nothing more he wishes.
He has his rifle, his powder horn, his bullet pouch, his flint
and steel and his hunting knife. Anything more would be a burden,
but his heart is warm with gratitude to his brothers."</p>

<p>At this point in the conversation, Mul-tal-la returned with news
of what he had learned by his inquiries among the Nez Perces.</p>

<p>The knowledge amounted to little. Chief Amokeat had led his warriors
northward three days before, starting just as the sun appeared.
He gave no word as to when he would come back, and none could
do anything more than guess, nor was the leader clear as to the
nature of the business on which he ventured. Perhaps he himself
did not know.</p>

<p>Still the task that Deerfoot had set himself seemed possible
of accomplishment. Knowing the point at which the party left the
village and the course taken by them, he could strike the trail,
and to keep to it would not be more difficult than many feats
he had performed amid the forests and canebrakes of Kentucky and
Ohio. He made sure that there was no mistake at the beginning.
Then he bade his friends good-bye.</p>

<p>Before doing so he talked for some minutes with Mul-tal-la. The
Blackfoot favored the course Deerfoot had laid out for himself,
though it was not unlikely that the fact that opposition was useless
may have had its weight in the conclusion reached by Mul-tal-la.
He told the Shawanoe that he would proceed straight to the Blackfoot
country, and there await the coming of his friend, who expected
like the boys to spend the winter in that northern region.</p>

<p>Deerfoot disliked "scenes" as much as did George and Victor Shelton.
The only ceremony between him and the three was the shaking of
hands and the expression of good wishes. Thus they parted. The
dusky youth made his way directly to the point where he had been
informed Amokeat and his party had left on their northward excursion,
and, without looking behind him, found the trail and began his
long journey.</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la waited for some minutes after his departure and then
gave the word for the brothers to make ready. Accordingly, the
horses were brought to the village, the saddles and bridles taken
from the lodge of the chieftain, where they had been stored, together
with the superfluous articles left behind when the explorers started
on their canoe voyage down the Columbia. To this property was
added that which had gone on the voyage. Everything was carefully
packed on the back of Zigzag, saddles and bridles were put in
place, all three mounted, waved good-bye and thanks to the Nez
Perces, most of those that remained behind having gathered to
see the visitors off. Then these in turn began the journey which
was to take them through a pass in the Rocky Mountains and into
the extensive Blackfoot country. For a time we will leave them
to themselves and give our attention to Deerfoot, who was never
more resolute of purpose than when he determined not to rejoin
his friends until he had recovered Whirlwind, or at least gained
tidings of him.</p>

<p>It may be said that the young Shawanoe was hopeful of finding
the stallion unharmed, and he had reasonable ground for such hope.
He could not help feeling displeased with the action of Amokeat,
who certainly had presumed in thus using the property of another.
Still, if no harm had befallen the steed, the Shawanoe would check
the reproof he had in mind.</p>

<p>Several facts caused Deerfoot uneasiness. The beauty and nobleness
of the stallion could not fail to excite envy wherever and by
whomever seen. His owner believed that Amokeat would steal him
if he had the chance, but it need not be explained that the circumstances
rendered that impossible. In venturing upon this raid, the Nez
Perces were sure to come in collision with hostile Indians. They
had lost warriors and horses before. Indeed, their enemies had
invaded the homes of the Nez Perces and robbed them. Suppose Amokeat
and his companions got into a fight with some of the northern
tribes. As likely as not the Nez Perces would be defeated. In
that case, Whirlwind would be first of the spoils gathered in
by the victors.</p>

<p>Suppose again the Nez Perces were victorious. The possession
of the matchless stallion must be betrayed to their enemies, who
would leave no stone unturned to capture him. There was every
reason, too, to fear that the hostiles would be successful; for
they would be in their own country and have every advantage on
their side. With all the charity that Deerfoot could feel, he
could not help condemning the Nez Perce chieftain for taking the
great risk of causing the loss of Whirlwind.</p>

<p>You need hardly be reminded that if Deerfoot found this had taken
place, he had no thought of giving up the hunt. If it was conceivable
that the steed had fallen into the hands of the Eskimos, and they
had journeyed to the Arctic circle with him, the Shawanoe would
have kept straight on until he overtook the despoilers.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe gave a fine exhibition of his consummate skill in
tracking a party of horsemen. When this party numbered a score,
more or less, it was no trouble to keep to the trail, which was
plainly marked; but had he done this his progress would have been
delayed, for he would have had to follow every turning and doubling,
which would have made the journey twice as lengthy as a straight
line.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot was hardly a mile from the Nez Perce village he
followed the footprints to the top of a ridge, where he paused
and scanned the broad, mountainous country spread out before him.
He knew the Nez Perces must have reached this point shortly after
sunrise. He noted the general direction of the trail as it descended
the slope in front, and accepted that as the course which the
horsemen intended to follow. Then he fixed upon the point where
they would be likely to make their midday halt. It was a clump
of trees and undergrowth on the shores of a small lake, whose
waters gleamed in the sun. Paying no further attention to the
trail itself, Deerfoot set out at a swift lope for the body of
water.</p>
