<p>
&quot;Uncle, I have discovered what girls are made for,&quot; said Rose, the
day after the reconciliation of Archie and the Prince.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, my dear, what is it?&quot; asked Dr. Alec, who was &quot;planking the
deck,&quot; as he called his daily promenade up and down the hall.</p>

<p>&quot;To take care of boys,&quot; answered Rose, quite beaming with
satisfaction as she spoke. &quot;Phebe laughed when I told her, and said
she thought girls had better learn to take care of themselves first.
But that's because she hasn't got seven boy-cousins as I have.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is right, nevertheless, Rosy, and so are you, for the two things
go together, and in helping seven lads you are unconsciously doing
much to improve one lass,&quot; said Dr. Alec, stopping to nod and
smile at the bright-faced figure resting on the old bamboo chair,
after a lively game of battledore and shuttlecock, in place of a run
which a storm prevented.</p>

<p>&quot;Am I? I'm glad of that; but really, uncle, I do feel as if I must take
care of the boys, for they come to me in all sorts of troubles, and
ask advice, and I like it so much. Only I don't always know what to
do, and I'm going to consult you privately and then surprise them
with my wisdom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right, my dear; what's the first worry? I see you have
something on your little mind, so come and tell uncle.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose put her arm in his, and, pacing to and fro, told him all about
Charlie, asking what she could do to keep him straight, and be a
real sister to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Could you make up your mind to go and stay with Aunt Clara a
month?&quot; asked the Doctor, when she ended.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir; but I shouldn't like it. Do you really want me to go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The best cure for Charlie is a daily dose of Rose water, or Rose
and water, or Rose and water; will you go and see that he takes it?&quot;
laughed Dr. Alec.</p>

<p>&quot;You mean that if I'm there and try to make it pleasant, he will stay
at home and keep out of mischief?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But could I make it pleasant? He would want the boys.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No danger but he'd have the boys, for they swarm after you like
bees after their queen. Haven't you found that out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Plen often says they never used to be here half so much
before I came, but I never thought I made the difference, it seemed
so natural to have them round.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Little modesty doesn't know what a magnet she is; but she will
find it out some day,&quot; and the Doctor softly stroked the cheek that
had grown rosy with pleasure at the thought of being so much
loved. &quot;Now, you see, if I move the magnet to Aunt Clara's, the
lads will go there as sure as iron to steel, and Charlie will be so
happy at home he won't care for these mischievous mates of his I
hope,&quot; added the Doctor, well knowing how hard it was to wean a
seventeen-year-old boy from his first taste of what is called &quot;seeing
life,&quot; which, alas! often ends in seeing death.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go, uncle, right away! Aunt Clara is always asking me, and
will be glad to get me. I shall have to dress and dine late, and see
lots of company, and be very fashionable, but I'll try not to let it
hurt me; and if I get in a puzzle or worried about anything I can
run to you,&quot; answered Rose, good-will conquering timidity.</p>

<p>So it was decided, and without saying much about the real reason
for this visit, Rose was transplanted to Aunt Clara's, feeling that
she had a work to do, and very eager to do it well.</p>

<p>Dr. Alec was right about the bees, for the boys did follow their
queen, and astonished Mrs. Clara by their sudden assiduity in
making calls, dropping in to dinner, and getting up evening frolics.
Charlie was a devoted host, and tried to show his gratitude by
being very kind to his &quot;little sister,&quot; for he guessed why she came,
and his heart was touched by her artless endeavours to &quot;help him
be good.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose often longed to be back in the old house with the simpler
pleasures and more useful duties of the life there; but, having
made up her mind, in spite of Phebe, that &quot;girls were made to take
care of boys,&quot; here motherly little soul found much to enjoy in the
new task she had undertaken.</p>

<p>It was a pretty sight to see the one earnest, sweet-faced girl among
the flock of tall lads, trying to understand, to help and please them
with a patient affection that worked many a small miracle
unperceived. Slang, rough manners, and careless habits were
banished or bettered by the presence of a little gentlewoman; and
all the manly virtues cropping up were encouraged by the hearty
admiration bestowed upon them by one whose good opinion all
valued more than they confessed; while Rose tried to imitate the
good qualities she praised in them, to put away her girlish vanities
and fears, to be strong and just, and frank and brave, as well as
modest, kind, and beautiful.</p>

<p>This trial worked so well that when the month was over, Mac and
Steve demanded a visit in their turn, and Rose went, feeling that
she would like to hear grim Aunt Jane say, as Aunt Clara did at
parting, &quot;I wish I could keep you all my life, dear.&quot;</p>

<p>After Mac and Steve had had their turn, Archie and Company bore
her away for some weeks; and with them she was so happy, she
felt as if she would like to stay for ever, if she could have Uncle
Alec also.</p>

<p>Of course, Aunt Myra could not be neglected, and, with secret
despair, Rose went to the &quot;Mausoleum,&quot; as the boys called her
gloomy abode. Fortunately, she was very near home, and Dr. Alec
dropped in so often that her visit was far less dismal than she
expected. Between them, they actually made Aunt Myra laugh
heartily more than once; and Rose did her so much good by letting
in the sunshine, singing about the silent house, cooking wholesome
messes, and amusing the old lady with funny little lectures on
physiology, that she forgot to take her pills and gave up &quot;Mum's
Elixir,&quot; because she slept so well, after the long walks and drives
she was beguiled into taking, that she needed no narcotic.</p>

<p>So the winter flew rapidly away, and it was May before Rose was
fairly settled again at home. They called her the &quot;Monthly Rose,&quot;
because she had spent a month with each of the aunts, and left
such pleasant memories of bloom and fragrance behind her, that
all wanted the family flower back again.</p>

<p>Dr. Alec rejoiced greatly over his recovered treasure; but as the
time drew near when his year of experiment ended, he had many a
secret fear that Rose might like to make her home for the next
twelve month with Aunt Jessie, or even Aunt Clara, for Charlie's
sake. He said nothing, but waited with much anxiety for the day
when the matter should be decided; and while he waited he did his
best to finish as far as possible the task he had begun so well.</p>

<p>Rose was very happy now, being out nearly all day enjoying the
beautiful awakening of the world, for spring came bright and early,
as if anxious to do its part. The old horse-chestnuts budded round
her windows, green things sprung up like magic in the garden
under her hands, hardy flowers bloomed as fast as they could, the
birds sang blithely overhead, and every day a chorus of pleasant
voices cried, &quot;Good morning, cousin, isn't it jolly weather?&quot;</p>

<p>No one remembered the date of the eventful conversation which
resulted in the Doctor's experiment (no one but himself at least);
so when the aunts were invited to tea one Saturday they came quite
unsuspiciously, and were all sitting together having a social chat,
when Brother Alec entered with two photographs in his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you remember that?&quot; he said, showing one to Aunt Clara, who
happened to be nearest.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, indeed; it is very like her when she came. Quite her sad,
unchildlike expression, and thin little face, with the big dark eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>The picture was passed round, and all agreed that &quot;it was very like
Rose a year ago.&quot; This point being settled, the Doctor showed the
second picture, which was received with great approbation, and
pronounced a &quot;charming likeness.&quot;</p>

<p>It certainly was, and a striking contrast to the first one, for it was a
blooming, smiling face, full of girlish spirit and health, with no
sign of melancholy, though the soft eyes were thoughtful, and the
lines about the lips betrayed a sensitive nature.</p>

<p>Dr. Alec set both photographs on the chimneypiece, and, falling
back a step or two, surveyed them with infinite satisfaction for
several minutes, then wheeled round, saying briefly, as he pointed
to the two faces</p>

<p>&quot;Time is up; how do you think my experiment has succeeded,
ladies?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bless me, so it is!&quot; cried Aunt Plenty, dropping a stitch in her
surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;Beautifully, dear,&quot; answered Aunt Peace, smiling entire approval.</p>

<p>&quot;She certainly has improved, but appearances are deceitful, and
she had no constitution to build upon,&quot; croaked Aunt Myra.</p>

<p>&quot;I am willing to allow that, as far as mere health goes, the
experiment is a success,&quot; graciously observed Aunt Jane, unable to
forget Rose's kindness to her Mac.</p>

<p>&quot;So am I; and I'll go farther, for I really do believe Alec has done
wonders for the child; she will be a beauty in two or three years,&quot;
added Aunt Clara, feeling that she could say nothing better than
that.</p>

<p>&quot;I always knew he would succeed, and I'm so glad you all allow it,
for he deserves more credit than you know, and more praise than
he will ever get,&quot; cried Aunt Jessie, clapping her hands with an
enthusiasm that caused Jamie's little red stocking to wave like a
triumphal banner in the air.</p>

<p>Dr. Alec made them a splendid bow, looking much gratified, and
then said soberly</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you; now the question is, shall I go on? for this is only the
beginning. None of you know the hindrances I've had, the mistakes
I've made, the study I've given the case, and the anxiety I've often
felt. Sister Myra is right is one thing Rose is a delicate creature,
quick to flourish in the sunshine, and as quick to droop without it.
She has no special weakness, but inherits her mother's sensitive
nature, and needs the wisest, tenderest care, to keep a very ardent
little soul from wearing out a finely organised little body. I think I
have found the right treatment, and; with you to help me, I believe
we may build up a lovely and a noble woman, who will be a pride
and comfort to us all.&quot;</p>

<p>There Dr. Alec stopped to get his breath, for he had spoken very
earnestly, and his voice got a little husky over the last words. A
gentle murmur from the aunts seemed to encourage him, and he
went on with an engaging smile, for the good man was slyly trying
to win all the ladies to vote for him when the time came.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, I don't wish to be selfish or arbitrary, because I am her
guardian, and I shall leave Rose free to choose for herself. We all
want her, and if she likes to make her home with any of you rather
than with me, she shall do so. In fact, I encouraged her visits last
winter, that she might see what we can all offer her, and judge
where she will be happiest. Is not that the fairest way? Will you
agree to abide by her choice, as I do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, we will,&quot; said all the aunts, in quite a flutter of excitement at
the prospect of having Rose for a whole year.</p>

<p>&quot;Good! she will be here directly, and then we will settle the
question for another year. A most important year, mind you, for
she has got a good start, and will blossom rapidly now if all goes
well with her. So I beg of you don't undo my work, but deal very
wisely and gently with my little girl, for if any harm come to her, I
think it would break my heart.&quot;</p>

<p>As he spoke, Dr. Alec turned his back abruptly and affected to be
examining the pictures again; but the aunts understood how dear
the child was to the solitary man who had loved her mother years
ago, and who now found his happiness in cherishing the little Rose
who was so like her. The good ladies nodded and sighed, and
telegraphed to one another that none of them would complain if
not chosen, or ever try to rob Brother Alec of his &quot;Heart's Delight,&quot;
as the boys called Rose.</p>

<p>Just then a pleasant sound of happy voices came up from the
garden, and smiles broke out on all serious faces. Dr. Alec turned
at once, saying, as he threw back his head, &quot;There she is; now for
it!&quot;</p>

<p>The cousins had been a-Maying, and soon came flocking in laden
with the spoils.</p>

<p>&quot;Here is our bonny Scotch rose with all her thorns about her,&quot; said
Dr. Alec, surveying her with unusual pride and tenderness, as she
went to show Aunt Peace her basket full of early flowers, fresh
leaves, and curious lichens.</p>

<p>&quot;Leave your clutter in the hall, boys, and sit quietly down if you
choose to stop here, for we are busy,&quot; said Aunt Plenty, shaking
her finger at the turbulent Clan, who were bubbling over with the
jollity born of spring sunshine and healthy exercise.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, we choose to stay! Wouldn't miss our Saturday high
tea for anything,&quot; said the Chief, as he restored order among his
men with a nod, a word, and an occasional shake.</p>

<p>&quot;What is up? a court-martial?&quot; asked Charlie, looking at the
assembled ladies with affected awe and real curiosity, for these
faces betrayed that some interesting business was afloat.</p>

<p>Dr. Alec explained in a few words, which he made as brief and
calm as he could; but the effect was exciting, nevertheless, for
each of the lads began at once to bribe, entice, and wheedle &quot;our
cousin&quot; to choose his home.</p>

<p>&quot;You really ought to come to us for mother's sake, as a relish, you
know, for she must be perfectly satiated with boys,&quot; began Archie,
using the strongest argument he could think of at the moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! yes,&quot; she thought, &quot;he wants me most! I've often longed to
give him something that he wished for very much, and now I can.&quot;</p>

<p>So, when, at a sudden gesture from Aunt Peace, silence fell, Rose
said slowly, with a pretty colour in her cheeks, and a beseeching
look about the room, as if asking pardon of the boys</p>

<p>&quot;It's very hard to choose when everybody is so fond of me;
therefore I think I'd better go to the one who seems to need me
most.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear, the one you love the best and will be happiest with,&quot;
said Dr. Alec quickly, as a doleful sniff from Aunt Myra, and a
murmur of &quot;My sainted Caroline,&quot; made Rose pause and look that
way.</p>

<p>&quot;Take time, cousin; don't be in a hurry to make up your mind, and
remember, 'Codlin's your friend,' &quot; added Charlie, hopeful still.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want any time! I know who I love best, who I'm happiest
with, and I choose uncle. Will he have me?&quot; cried Rose, in a tone
that produced a sympathetic thrill among the hearers, it was so full
of tender confidence and love.</p>

<p>If she really had any doubt, the look in Dr. Alec's face banished it
without a word, as he opened wide his arms, and she ran into them,
feeling that home was there.</p>

<p>No one spoke for a minute, but there were signs of emotion among
the aunts, which warned the boys to bestir themselves before the
water-works began to play. So they took hands and began to
prance about uncle and niece, singing, with sudden inspiration, the
nursery rhyme</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;Ring around a Rosy!&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Of course that put an end to all sentiment, and Rose emerged
laughing from Dr. Alec's bosom, with the mark of a waistcoat
button nicely imprinted on her left cheek. He saw it, and said with
a merry kiss that half effaced it, &quot;This is my ewe lamb, and I have
set my mark on her, so no one can steal her away.&quot;</p>

<p>That tickled the boys, and they set up a shout of</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;Uncle had a little lamb!&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>But Rose hushed the noise by slipping into the circle, and making
them dance prettily like lads and lasses round a May-pole; while
Phebe, coming in with fresh water for the flowers, began to twitter,
chirp, and coo, as if all the birds of the air had come to join in the
spring revel of the eight cousins.</p>
