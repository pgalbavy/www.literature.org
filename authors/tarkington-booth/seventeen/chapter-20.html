<p>At the farm-house where the party were to dine, Miss Pratt with
joy discovered a harmonium in the parlor, and, seating herself,
with all the girls, Flopit, and Mr. George Crooper gathered around
her, she played an accompaniment, while George, in a thin tenor
of detestable sweetness, sang "I'm Falling in Love with Some One."</p>

<p>His performance was rapturously greeted, especially by the accompanist.
"Oh, wunnerfulest Untle Georgiecums!" she cried, for that was
now the gentleman's name. "If Johnnie McCormack hear Untle Georgiecums
he go shoot umself dead &mdash;Bang!" She looked round to where
three figures hovered morosely in the rear. "Tum on, sin' chorus,
Big Bruvva Josie-Joe, Johnny Jump-up, an' Ickle Boy Baxter. All
over adain, Untle Georgiecums! Boys an' dirls all sin' chorus.
Tummence!"</p>

<p>And so the heartrending performance continued until it was stopped
by Wallace Banks, the altruistic and perspiring youth who had
charge of the subscription-list for the party, and the consequent
collection of assessments. This entitled Wallace to look haggard
and to act as master of ceremonies. He mounted a chair.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he bellowed, "I want to say&mdash;that is&mdash;ah
&mdash;I am requested to announce t that before dinner we're all
supposed to take a walk around the farm and look at things, as
this is supposed to be kind of a model farm or supposed to be
something like that. There's a Swedish lady named Anna going to
show us around. She's out in the yard waiting, so please follow
her to inspect the farm."</p>

<p>To inspect a farm was probably the least of William's desires.
He wished only to die in some quiet spot and to have Miss Pratt
told about it in words that would show her what she had thrown
away. But he followed with the others, in the wake of the Swedish
lady named Anna, and as they stood in the cavernous hollow of
the great barn he found his condition suddenly improved.</p>

<p>Miss Pratt turned to him unexpectedly and placed Flopit in his
arms. "Keep p'eshus Flopit cozy," she whispered. "Flopit love
ole friends best!"</p>

<p>William's heart leaped, while a joyous warmth spread all over
him. And though the execrable lummox immediately propelled Miss
Pratt forward&mdash;by her elbow&mdash;to hear the descriptive remarks of
the Swedish lady named Anna, William's soul remained uplifted
and entranced. She had not said "like"; she had said, "Flopit
<em>LOVE </em>ole friends best"! William pressed forward valiantly,
and placed himself as close as possible upon the right of Miss
Pratt, the lummox being upon her left. A moment later, William
wished that he had remained in the rear.</p>

<p>This was due to the unnecessary frankness of the Swedish lady
named Anna, who was briefly pointing out the efficiency of various
agricultural devices. Her attention being diverted by some effusions
of pride on the part of a passing hen, she thought fit to laugh
and say:</p>

<p>"She yust laid egg."</p>

<p>William shuddered. This grossness in the presence of Miss Pratt
was unthinkable. His mind refused to deal with so impossible a
situation; he could not accept it as a fact that such words had
actually been uttered in such a presence. And yet it was the truth;
his incredulous ears still sizzled. "She yust laid egg!" His entire
skin became flushed; his averted eyes glazed themselves with shame.</p>

<p>He was not the only person shocked by the ribaldry of the Swedish
lady named Anna. Joe Bullitt and Johnnie Watson, on the outskirts
of the group, went to Wallace Banks, drew him aside, and, with
feverish eloquence, set his responsibilities before him. It was
his duty, they urged, to have an immediate interview with this
free-spoken Anna and instruct her in the proprieties. Wallace
had been almost as horrified as they by her loose remark, but
he declined the office they proposed for him, offering, however,
to appoint them as a committee with authority in the matter&mdash;whereupon
they retorted with unreasonable indignation, demanding to know
what he took them for.</p>

<p>Unconscious of the embarrassment she had caused in these several
masculine minds, the Swedish lady named Anna led the party onward,
continuing her agricultural lecture. William walked mechanically,
his eyes averted and looking at no one. And throughout this agony
he was burningly conscious of the blasphemed presence of Miss
Pratt beside him.</p>

<p>Therefore, it was with no little surprise, when the party came
out of the barn, that William beheld Miss Pratt, not walking at
his side, but on the contrary, sitting too cozily with George
Crooper upon a fallen tree at the edge of a peach-orchard just
beyond the barn-yard. It was Miss Parcher who had been walking
beside him, for the truant couple had made their escape at the
beginning of the Swedish lady's discourse.</p>

<p>In vain William murmured to himself, "Flopit love ole friends
best."  Purple and black again descended upon his soul, for he
could not disguise from himself the damnatory fact that George
had flitted with the lady, while he, wretched William, had been
permitted to take care of the dog!</p>

<p>A spark of dignity still burned within him. He strode to the
barn-yard fence, and, leaning over it, dropped Flopit rather brusquely
at his mistress's feet. Then, without a word even without a look
&mdash;William walked haughtily away, continuing his stern progress
straight through the barn-yard gate, and thence onward until he
found himself in solitude upon the far side of a smoke-house,
where his hauteur vanished.</p>

<p>Here, in the shade of a great walnut-tree which sheltered the
little building, he gave way&mdash;not to tears, certainly, but to
faint murmurings and little heavings under impulses as ancient
as young love itself. It is to be supposed that William considered
his condition a lonely one, but if all the seventeen-year-olds
who have known such halfhours could have shown themselves to him
then, he would have fled from the mere horror of billions. Alas!
he considered his sufferings a new invention in the world, and
there was now inspired in his breast a monologue so eloquently
bitter that it might deserve some such title as A Passion Beside
the Smoke-house. During the little time that William spent in
this sequestration he passed through phases of emotion which would
have kept an older man busy for weeks and left him wrecked at
the end of them.</p>

<p>William's final mood was one of beautiful resignation with a
kick in it; that is, he nobly gave her up to George and added
irresistibly that George was a big, fat lummox! Painting pictures,
such as the billions of other young sufferers before him have
painted, William saw himself a sad, gentle old bachelor at the
family fireside, sometimes making the sacrifice of his reputation
so that <em>SHE </em>and the children might never know the truth
about George; and he gave himself the solace of a fierce scene
or two with George: "Remember, it is for them, not you&mdash;you <em>THING</em>!"</p>

<p>After this human little reaction he passed to a higher field
of romance. He would die for George and then she would bring the
little boy she had named William to the lonely headstone &mdash;Suddenly
William saw himself in his true and fitting character &mdash;Sydney
Carton! He had lately read A Tale of Two Cities, immediately re-reading
until, as he would have said, he "knew it by heart"; and even
at the time he had seen resemblances between himself and the appealing
figure of Carton. Now that the sympathy between them was perfected
by Miss Pratt's preference for another, William decided to mount
the scaffold in place of George Crooper. The scene became actual
to him, and, setting one foot upon a tin milk-pail which some
one had carelessly left beside the smoke-house, he lifted his
eyes to the pitiless blue sky and unconsciously assumed the familiar
attitude of Carton on the steps of the guillotine. He spoke aloud
those great last words:</p>

<p>"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done;
it is a far, far better rest that I go to&mdash;"</p>

<p>A whiskered head on the end of a long, corrugated red neck protruded
from the smokehouse door.</p>

<p>"What say?" it inquired, huskily.</p>

<p>"Nun-nothing!" stammered William.</p>

<p>Eyes above whiskers became fierce. "You take your feet off that
milk-bucket. Say! This here's a sanitary farm. 'Ain't you got
any more sense 'n to go an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>But William had abruptly removed his foot and departed.</p>

<p>He found the party noisily established in the farm-house at two
long tables piled with bucolic viands already being violently
depleted. Johnnie Watson had kept a chair beside himself vacant
for William. Johnnie was in no frame of mind to sit beside any
"chattering girl,"  and he had protected himself by Joe Bullitt
upon his right and the empty seat upon his left. William took
it, and gazed upon the nearer foods with a slight renewal of animation.</p>

<p>He began to eat; he continued to eat; in fact, he did well. So
did his two comrades. Not that the melancholy of these three was
dispersed&mdash;far from it! With ineffaceable gloom they ate chicken,
both white meat and dark, drumsticks, wishbones, and livers; they
ate corn-on-the-cob, many ears, and fried potatoes and green peas
and string-beans; they ate peach preserves and apricot preserves
and preserved pears; they ate biscuits with grape jelly and biscuits
with crabapple jelly; they ate apple sauce and apple butter and
apple pie. They ate pickles, both cucumber pickles and pickles
made of watermelon rind; they ate pickled tomatoes, pickled peppers,
also pickled onions. They ate lemon pie.</p>

<p>At that, they were no rivals to George Crooper, who was a real
eater. Love had not made his appetite ethereal to-day, and even
the attending Swedish lady named Anna felt some apprehension when
it came to George and the gravy, though she was accustomed to
the prodigies performed in this line by the robust hands on the
farm. George laid waste his section of the table, and from the
beginning he allowed himself scarce time to say, "I dunno why
it is." The pretty companion at his side at first gazed dumfounded;
then, with growing enthusiasm for what promised to be a really
magnificent performance, she began to utter little ejaculations
of wonder and admiration. With this music in his ears, George
outdid himself. He could not resist the temptation to be more
and more astonishing as a heroic comedian, for these humors sometimes
come upon vain people at country dinners.</p>

<p>George ate when he had eaten more than he needed; he ate long
after every one understood why he was so vast; he ate on and on
sheerly as a flourish&mdash;as a spectacle. He ate even when he himself
began to understand that there was daring in what he did, for
his was a toreador spirit so long as he could keep bright eyes
fastened upon him.</p>

<p>Finally, he ate to decide wagers made upon his gorging, though
at times during this last period his joviality deserted him. Anon
his damp brow would be troubled, and he knew moments of thoughtfulness.</p>
