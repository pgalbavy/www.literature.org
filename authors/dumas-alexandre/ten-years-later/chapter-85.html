<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

<P>The admiral, as we have seen, was determined to pay no
further attention to Buckingham's threatening glances and
fits of passion. In fact, from the moment they quitted
England, he had gradually accustomed himself to his
behavior. De Guiche had not yet in any way remarked the
animosity which appeared to influence that young nobleman
against him, but he felt, instinctively, that there could be
no sympathy between himself and the favorite of Charles II.
The queen-mother, with greater experience and calmer
judgment, perceived the exact position of affairs, and, as
she discerned its danger, was prepared to meet it, whenever
the proper moment should arrive. Quiet had been everywhere
restored, except in Buckingham's heart; he, in his
impatience, addressed himself to the princess, in a low tone
of voice: &quot;For Heaven's sake, madame, I implore you to
hasten your disembarkation. Do you not perceive how that
insolent Duke of Norfolk is killing me with his attentions
and devotions to you?&quot;</P>
<P>Henrietta heard this remark; she smiled, and without turning
her head towards him, but giving only to the tone of her
voice that inflection of gentle reproach, and languid
impertinence, which women and princesses so well know how to
assume, she murmured, &quot;I have already hinted, my lord, that
you must have taken leave of your senses.&quot;</P>
<P>Not a single detail escaped Raoul's attention; he heard both
Buckingham's entreaty and the princess's reply; he remarked
Buckingham retire, heard his deep sigh, and saw him pass his
hand across his face. He understood everything, and trembled
as he reflected on the position of affairs, and the state of
the minds of those about him. At last the admiral, with
studied delay, gave the last orders for the departure of the
boats.</P>
<P>Buckingham heard the directions given with such an
exhibition of delight that a stranger would really imagine
the young man's reason was affected. As the Duke of Norfolk
gave his commands, a large boat or barge, decked with flags,
and capable of holding about twenty rowers and fifteen
passengers, was slowly lowered from the side of the
admiral's vessel. The barge was carpeted with velvet and
decorated with coverings embroidered with the arms of
England, and with garlands of flowers; for, at that time,
ornamentation was by no means forgotten in these political
pageants. No sooner was this really royal boat afloat and
the rowers with oars uplifted, awaiting, like soldiers
presenting arms, the embarkation of the princess, than
Buckingham ran forward to the ladder in order to take his
place. His progress was, however, arrested by the queen. &quot;My
lord,&quot; she said, &quot;it is hardly becoming that you should
allow my daughter and myself to land without having
previously ascertained that our apartments are properly
prepared. I beg your lordship to be good enough to precede
us ashore, and to give directions that everything be in
proper order on our arrival.&quot;</P>
<P>This was a fresh disappointment for the duke, and, still
more so, since it was so unexpected. He hesitated, colored
violently, but could not reply. He had thought he might be
able to keep near Madame during the passage to the shore,
and, by this means, to enjoy to the very last moment the
brief period fortune still reserved for him. The order,
however, was explicit; and the admiral, who heard it given,
immediately called out, &quot;Launch the ship's gig.&quot; His
directions were executed with that celerity which
distinguishes every maneuver on board a man-of-war.</P>
<P>Buckingham, in utter hopelessness, cast a look of despair at
the princess, of supplication towards the queen, and
directed a glance full of anger towards the admiral. The
princess pretended not to notice him, while the queen turned
aside her head, and the admiral laughed outright, at the
sound of which Buckingham seemed ready to spring upon him.
The queen-mother rose, and with a tone of authority said,
&quot;Pray set off, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>The young duke hesitated, looked around him, and with a last
effort, half-choked by contending emotions, said, &quot;And you,
gentlemen, M. de Guiche and M. de Bragelonne, do not you
accompany me?&quot;</P>
<P>De Guiche bowed and said, &quot;Both M. de Bragelonne and myself
await her majesty's orders; whatever the commands she
imposes on us, we shall obey them.&quot; Saying this, he looked
towards the princess, who cast down her eyes.</P>
<P>&quot;Your grace will remember,&quot; said the queen, &quot;that M. de
Guiche is here to represent Monsieur; it is he who will do
the honors of France, as you have done those of England; his
presence cannot be dispensed with; besides, we owe him this
slight favor for the courage he displayed in venturing to
seek us in such a terrible stress of weather.&quot;</P>
<P>Buckingham opened his lips, as if he were about to speak,
but, whether thoughts or expressions failed him, not a
syllable escaped them, and turning away, as though out of
his mind, he leapt from the vessel into the boat. The
sailors were just in time to catch hold of him to steady
themselves; for his weight and the rebound had almost upset
the boat.</P>
<P>&quot;His grace cannot be in his senses,&quot; said the admiral aloud
to Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;I am uneasy on the Duke's account,&quot; replied Bragelonne.</P>
<P>While the boat was advancing towards the shore, the duke
kept his eyes immovably fixed upon the admiral's ship, like
a miser torn away from his coffers, or a mother separated
from her child, about to be led away to death. No one,
however, acknowledged his signals, his frowns, or his
pitiful gestures. In very anguish of mind, he sank down in
the boat, burying his hands in his hair, whilst the boat,
impelled by the exertions of the merry sailors, flew over
the waves. On his arrival he was in such a state of apathy,
that, had he not been received at the harbor by the
messenger whom he had directed to precede him, he would
hardly have had strength to ask his way. Having once,
however, reached the house which had been set apart for him,
he shut himself up, like Achilles in his tent. The barge
bearing the princesses quitted the admiral's vessel at the
very moment Buckingham landed. It was followed by another
boat filled with officers, courtiers, and zealous friends.
Great numbers of the inhabitants of Havre, having embarked
in fishing-cobles and boats of every description, set off to
meet the royal barge. The cannon from the forts fired
salutes, which were returned by the flagship and the two
other vessels, and the flashes from the open mouths of the
cannon floated in white fumes over the waves, and
disappeared in the clear blue sky.</P>
<P>The princess landed at the decorated quay. Bands of gay
music greeted her arrival, and accompanied her every step
she took. During the time she was passing through the center
of the town, and treading beneath her delicate feet the
richest carpets and the gayest flowers, which had been
strewn upon the ground, De Guiche and Raoul, escaping from
their English friends, hurried through the town and hastened
rapidly towards the place intended for the residence of
Madame.</P>
<P>&quot;Let us hurry forward,&quot; said Raoul to De Guiche, &quot;for if I
read Buckingham's character aright, he will create some
disturbance, when he learns the result of our deliberations
of yesterday.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never fear,&quot; said De Guiche, &quot;De Wardes is there, who is
determination itself, while Manicamp is the very
personification of artless gentleness.&quot;</P>
<P>De Guiche was not, however, the less diligent on that
account, and five minutes afterwards they were within sight
of the Hotel de Ville. The first thing which struck them was
the number of people assembled in the square. &quot;Excellent,&quot;
said De Guiche; &quot;our apartments, I see, are prepared.&quot;</P>
<P>In fact, in front of the Hotel de Ville, upon the wide open
space before it, eight tents had been raised, surmounted by
the flags of France and England united. The hotel was
surrounded by tents, as by a girdle of variegated colors;
ten pages and a dozen mounted troopers, who had been given
to the ambassadors, for an escort, mounted guard before the
tents. It had a singularly curious effect, almost fairy-like
in its appearance. These tents had been constructed during
the night-time. Fitted up, within and without, with the
richest materials that De Guiche had been able to procure in
Havre, they completely encircled the Hotel de Ville. The
only passage which led to the steps of the hotel, and which
was not inclosed by the silken barricade, was guarded by two
tents, resembling two pavilions, the doorways of both of
which opened towards the entrance. These two tents were
destined for De Guiche and Raoul; in whose absence they were
intended to be occupied, that of De Guiche by De Wardes, and
that of Raoul by Manicamp. Surrounding these two tents, and
the six others, a hundred officers, gentlemen, and pages,
dazzling in their display of silk and gold, thronged like
bees buzzing about a hive. Every one of them, their swords
by their sides, was ready to obey the slightest sign either
of De Guiche or Bragelonne, the leaders of the embassy.</P>
<P>At the very moment the two young men appeared at the end of
one of the streets leading to the square, they perceived,
crossing the square at full gallop, a young man on
horseback, whose costume was of surprising richness. He
pushed hastily through the crowd of curious lookers-on, and,
at the sight of these unexpected erections, uttered a cry of
anger and dismay. It was Buckingham, who had awakened from
his stupor, in order to adorn himself with a costume
perfectly dazzling from its beauty, and to await the arrival
of the princess and the queen-mother at the Hotel de Ville.
At the entrance to the tents, the soldiers barred his
passage, and his further progress was arrested. Buckingham,
hopelessly infuriated, raised his whip; but his arm was
seized by a couple of officers. Of the two guardians of the
tent, only one was there. De Wardes was in the interior of
the Hotel de Ville, engaged in attending to the execution of
some orders given by De Guiche. At the noise made by
Buckingham Manicamp, who was indolently reclining upon the
cushions at the doorway of one of the tents, rose with his
usual indifference, and, perceiving that the disturbance
continued, made his appearance from underneath the curtains.
&quot;What is the matter?&quot; he said, in a gentle tone of voice,
&quot;and who is it making this disturbance?&quot;</P>
<P>It so happened, that, at the moment he began to speak,
silence had just been restored, and, although his voice was
very soft and gentle in its tone, every one heard his
question. Buckingham turned round; and looked at the tall,
thin figure, and the listless expression of countenance of
his questioner. Probably the personal appearance of
Manicamp, who was dressed very plainly, did not inspire him
with much respect, for he replied disdainfully, &quot;Who may you
be, monsieur?&quot;</P>
<P>Manicamp, leaning on the arm of a gigantic trooper, as firm
as the pillar of a cathedral, replied in his usual tranquil
tone of voice,  -  &quot;And you, monsieur?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I, monsieur, am the Duke of Buckingham; I have hired all
the houses which surround the Hotel de Ville, where I have
business to transact; and as these houses are let, they
belong to me, and, as I hired them in order to preserve the
right of free access to the Hotel de Ville, you are not
justified in preventing me passing to it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But who prevents you passing, monsieur?&quot; inquired Manicamp.</P>
<P>&quot;Your sentinels.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because you wish to pass on horseback, and orders have been
given to let only persons on foot pass.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No one has any right to give orders here, except myself,&quot;
said Buckingham.</P>
<P>&quot;On what grounds?&quot; inquired Manicamp, with his soft tone.
&quot;Will you do me the favor to explain this enigma to me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because, as I have already told you, I have hired all the
houses looking on the square.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We are very well aware of that, since nothing but the
square itself has been left for us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are mistaken, monsieur; the square belongs to me, as
well as the houses in it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Forgive me, monsieur, but you are mistaken there. In our
country, we say, the highway belongs to the king, therefore
this square is his majesty's; and, consequently, as we are
the king's ambassadors, the square belongs to us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have already asked you who you are, monsieur,&quot; exclaimed
Buckingham, exasperated at the coolness of his interlocutor.</P>
<P>&quot;My name is Manicamp,&quot; replied the young man, in a voice
whose tones were as harmonious and sweet as the notes of an
AEolian harp.</P>
<P>Buckingham shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and said,
&quot;When I hired these houses which surround the Hotel de
Ville, the square was unoccupied; these barracks obstruct my
sight; I hereby order them to be removed.&quot;</P>
<P>A hoarse and angry murmur ran through the crowd of listeners
at these words. De Guiche arrived at this moment; he pushed
through the crowd which separated him from Buckingham, and,
followed by Raoul, arrived on the scene of action from one
side, just as De Wardes came up from the other. &quot;Pardon me,
my lord; but if you have any complaint to make, have the
goodness to address it to me, inasmuch as it was I who
supplied the plans for the construction of these tents.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Moreover, I would beg you to observe, monsieur, that the
term `barrack' is a highly objectionable one!&quot; added
Manicamp, graciously.</P>
<P>&quot;You were saying, monsieur  -  &quot; continued De Guiche.</P>
<P>&quot;I was saying, monsieur le comte,&quot; resumed Buckingham, in a
tone of anger more marked than ever, although in some
measure moderated by the presence of an equal, &quot;I was saying
that it is impossible these tents can remain where they
are.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Impossible!&quot; exclaimed De Guiche, &quot;and why?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because I object to them.&quot;</P>
<P>A movement of impatience escaped De Guiche, but a warning
glance from Raoul restrained him.</P>
<P>&quot;You should the less object to them, monsieur, on account of
the abuse of priority you have permitted yourself to
exercise.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Abuse!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Most assuredly. You commission a messenger, who hires in
your name the whole of the town of Havre, without
considering the members of the French court, who would be
sure to arrive here to meet Madame. Your Grace will admit
that this is hardly friendly conduct in the representative
of a friendly nation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The right of possession belongs to him who is first on the
ground.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not in France, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not in France?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because France is a country where politeness is observed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Which means!&quot; exclaimed Buckingham, in so violent a manner
that those who were present drew back, expecting an
immediate collision.</P>
<P>&quot;Which means, monsieur,&quot; replied De Guiche, now rather pale,
&quot;that I caused these tents to be raised as habitations for
myself and my friends, as a shelter for the ambassadors of
France, as the only place of refuge which your exactions
have left us in the town; and that I and those who are with
me, shall remain in them, at least, until an authority more
powerful, and more supreme, than your own shall dismiss me
from them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In other words, until we are ejected, as the lawyers say,&quot;
observed Manicamp, blandly.</P>
<P>&quot;I know an authority, monsieur, which I trust is such as you
will respect,&quot; said Buckingham, placing his hand on his
sword.</P>
<P>At this moment, and as the goddess of Discord, inflaming all
minds, was about to direct their swords against each other,
Raoul gently placed his hand on Buckingham's shoulder. &quot;One
word, my lord,&quot; he said.</P>
<P>&quot;My right, my right, first of all,&quot; exclaimed the fiery
young man.</P>
<P>&quot;It is precisely upon that point I wish to have the honor of
addressing a word to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, monsieur, but let your remarks be brief.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;One question is all I ask; you can hardly expect me to be
briefer.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Speak, monsieur, I am listening.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you, or is the Duke of Orleans, going to marry the
granddaughter of Henry IV.?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; exclaimed Buckingham, retreating a few
steps, bewildered.</P>
<P>&quot;Have the goodness to answer me,&quot; persisted Raoul,
tranquilly.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you mean to ridicule me, monsieur?&quot; inquired Buckingham.</P>
<P>&quot;Your question is a sufficient answer for me. You admit,
then, that it is not you who are going to marry the
princess?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thou know it perfectly well, monsieur, I should imagine.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I beg your pardon, but your conduct has been such as to
leave it not altogether certain.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Proceed, monsieur, what do you mean to convey?&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul approached the duke. &quot;Are you aware, my lord,&quot; he
said, lowering his voice, &quot;that your extravagances very much
resemble the excesses of jealousy? These jealous fits, with
respect to any woman, are not becoming in one who is neither
her lover nor her husband; and I am sure you will admit that
my remark applies with still greater force, when the lady in
question is a princess of the blood royal!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; exclaimed Buckingham, &quot;do you mean to insult
Madame Henrietta?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Be careful, my lord,&quot; replied Bragelonne, coldly, &quot;for it
is you who insult her. A little while since, when on board
the admiral's ship, you wearied the queen, and exhausted the
admiral's patience. I was observing, my lord; and, at first,
I concluded you were not in possession of your senses, but I
have since surmised the real significance of your madness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur!&quot; exclaimed Buckingham.</P>
<P>&quot;One moment more, for I have yet another word to add. I
trust I am the only one of my companions who has guessed
it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you aware, monsieur,&quot; said Buckingham, trembling with
mingled feelings of anger and uneasiness, &quot;are you aware
that you are holding language towards me which requires to
be checked?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Weigh your words well, my lord,&quot; said Raoul, haughtily: &quot;my
nature is not such that its vivacities need checking; whilst
you, on the contrary, are descended from a race whose
passions are suspected by all true Frenchmen; I repeat,
therefore, for the second time, be careful!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Careful of what, may I ask? Do you presume to threaten me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am the son of the Comte de la Fere, my lord, and I never
threaten, because I strike first. Therefore, understand me
well, the threat that I hold out to you is this  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>Buckingham clenched his hands, but Raoul continued, as
though he had not observed the gesture. &quot;At the very first
word, beyond the respect and deference due to her royal
highness, which you permit yourself to use towards her,  - 
be patient, my lord, for I am perfectly so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Undoubtedly. So long as Madame remained on English
territory, I held my peace; but from the very moment she
stepped on French ground, and now that we have received her
in the name of the prince, I warn you, that at the first
mark of disrespect which you, in your insane attachment,
exhibit towards the royal house of France, I shall have one
of two courses to follow;  -  either I declare, in the
presence of every one, the madness with which you are now
affected, and I get you ignominiously ordered back to
England; or if you prefer it, I will run my dagger through
your throat in the presence of all here. This second
alternative seems to me the least disagreeable, and I think
I shall hold to it.&quot;</P>
<P>Buckingham had become paler than the lace collar around his
neck. &quot;M. de Bragelonne,&quot; he said, &quot;is it, indeed, a
gentleman who is speaking to me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; only the gentleman is speaking to a madman. Get cured,
my lord, and he will hold quite another language to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, M. de Bragelonne,&quot; murmured the duke, in a voice,
half-choked, and putting his hand to his neck,  -  &quot;Do you
not see I am choking?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If your death were to take place at this moment, my lord,&quot;
replied Raoul, with unruffled composure, &quot;I should, indeed,
regard it as a great happiness, for this circumstance would
prevent all kinds of evil remarks; not alone about yourself,
but also about those illustrious persons whom your devotion
is compromising in so absurd a manner.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are right, you are right,&quot; said the young man, almost
beside himself. &quot;Yes, yes; better to die, than to suffer as
I do at this moment.&quot; And he grasped a beautiful dagger, the
handle of which was inlaid with precious stones; and which
he half drew from his breast.</P>
<P>Raoul thrust his hand aside. &quot;Be careful what you do,&quot; he
said; &quot;if you do not kill yourself, you commit a ridiculous
action; and if you were to kill yourself, you sprinkle blood
upon the nuptial robe of the princess of England.&quot;</P>
<P>Buckingham remained a minute gasping for breath; during this
interval, his lips quivered, his fingers worked
convulsively, and his eyes wandered as though in delirium.
Then suddenly, he said, &quot;M. de Bragelonne, I know nowhere a
nobler mind than yours; you are, indeed, a worthy son of the
most perfect gentleman that ever lived. Keep your tents.&quot;
And he threw his arms round Raoul's neck. All who were
present, astounded at this conduct, which was the very
reverse of what was expected, considering the violence of
the one adversary and the determination of the other, began
immediately to clap their hands, and a thousand cheers and
joyful shouts arose from all sides. De Guiche, in his turn,
embraced Buckingham somewhat against his inclination; but,
at all events, he did embrace him. This was the signal for
French and English to do the same; and they who, until that
moment, had looked at each other with restless uncertainty,
fraternized on the spot. In the meantime, the procession of
the princess arrived, and had it not been for Bragelonne,
two armies would have been engaged together in conflict, and
blood have been shed upon the flowers with which the ground
was covered. At the appearance, however, of the banners
borne at the head of the procession, complete order was
restored.</P></article>
