<p><em>PETER RABBIT </em>was in trouble. He had gotten into mischief
and now, like every one who gets into mischief, he wished that
he hadn’t. The worst of it was that he was a long way from his
home in the dear Old Briar-patch, and he didn’t know how he ever
could get back there again. Where was he? Why, in the stone wall
on one side of Farmer Brown’s young peach orchard. How Peter blessed
the old stone wall in which he had found a safe hiding-place!
Bowser had hung around nearly all night, so that Peter had not
dared to try to go home. Now it was daylight, and Peter knew it
would not be safe to put his nose outside.</p>

<p>Peter was worried, so worried that he couldn’t go to sleep as
he usually does in the daytime. So he sat hidden in the old wall
and waited and watched. By and by he saw Farmer Brown and Farmer
Brown’s boy come out into the orchard. Right away they saw the
mischief which Peter had done, and he could tell by the sound
of their voices that they were very, very angry. They went away,
but before long they were back again, and all day long Peter watched
them work putting something around each of the young peach-trees.
Peter grew so curious that he forgot all about his troubles and
how far away from home he was. He could hardly wait for night
to come so that he might see what they had been doing.</p>

<p>Just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun started to go to bed behind
the Purple Hills, Farmer Brown and his boy started back to the
house. Farmer Brown was smiling now.</p>

<p>"I guess that that will fix him!" he said.</p>

<p>"Now what does he mean by that?" thought Peter. "Who will it
fix? Can it be me? I don’t need any fixing."</p>

<p>He waited just as long as he could. When all was still, and the
moonlight had begun to make shadows of the trees on the snow,
Peter very cautiously crept out of his hiding-place. Bowser the
Hound was nowhere in sight, and everything was as quiet and peaceful
as it had been when he first came into the orchard the night before.
Peter had fully made up his mind to go straight home as fast as
his long legs would take him, but his dreadful curiosity insisted
that first he must find out what Farmer Brown and his boy had
been doing to the young peach-trees.</p>

<p>So Peter hurried over to the nearest tree. All around the trunk
of the tree, from the ground clear up higher than Peter could
reach, was wrapped wire netting. Peter couldn’t get so much as
a nibble of the delicious bark. He hadn’t intended to take any,
for he had meant to go right straight home, but now that he couldn’t
get any, he wanted some more than ever,—just a bite. Peter looked
around. Everything was quiet. He would try the next tree, and
then he would go home.</p>

<p>But the next tree was wrapped with wire. Peter hesitated, looked
around, turned to go home, thought of how good that bark had tasted
the night before, hesitated again, and then hurried over to the
third tree. It was protected just like the others. Then Peter
forgot all about going home. He wanted some of that delicious
bark, and he ran from one tree to another as fast as he could
go.</p>

<p>At last, way down at the end of the orchard, Peter found a tree
that had no wire around it. "They must have forgotten this one!"
he thought, and his eyes sparkled. All around on the snow were
a lot of little, shiny wires, but Peter didn’t notice them. All
he saw was that delicious bark on the young peach-tree. He hopped
right into the middle of the wires, and then, just as he reached
up to take the first bite of bark, he felt something tugging at
one of his hind legs.</p>
