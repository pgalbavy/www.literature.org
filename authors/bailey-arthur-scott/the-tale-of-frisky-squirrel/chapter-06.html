<p>After he escaped from the fierce red-tailed hawk you would naturally
think that Frisky Squirrel would have been glad to keep away from such
a great, strong enemy. But the very next day found Frisky searching
everywhere for that cruel, hook-nosed Mr. Hawk. He wanted more of that
fine sport that he had had the day before, dodging and twisting around
the limbs of the trees, while Mr. Hawk swooped down and tried to seize
him. There was another reason, too, why Frisky wanted to find Mr. Hawk
again--and that was because he knew that it annoyed Mr. Hawk very much
not to be able to catch him. You see, Frisky Squirrel was a great
tease.
</p>
<p>Well, as I said, Frisky hunted all through the woods for the red-tailed
hawk. But he couldn't find him. There was a good reason why--and that
was because Mr. Hawk was waiting for Frisky in the top of a tree near
Mrs. Squirrel's home. He was waiting and watching--was Mr. Hawk. When
Frisky had given up his search and was almost home he heard the smaller
birds warning one another of the danger, telling of the savage old
fellow who was half-hidden on a high branch of the tall elm. Frisky
first heard a flicker calling to a towhee; and the towhee told a robin;
and the robin told a little song sparrow that he had better keep out of
sight unless he wanted Mr. Hawk to catch him. You may be sure that the
little song sparrow was very careful after that. He gave a few <u>chips</u>,
just to do his share in warning the other forest-people to look out for
the red-tailed hawk; and then he crept into a thicket and kept just as
still as a mouse.
</p><p>When Frisky heard the news--for he knew what the birds were telling one
another--he hurried along joyfully. <u>He</u> was not afraid of Mr. Hawk.
Mr. Hawk was the very person he was looking for.
</p><p>"Hello, you old ruffian!" Frisky called, as soon as he spied Mr. Hawk.
It certainly was a very impolite thing to say, even if it <u>was</u> true.
</p><p>Mr. Hawk turned his cruel eyes upon Frisky Squirrel and then he dashed
toward him as fast as he knew how. He dropped down like lightning from
his high perch, and Frisky had to dodge quickly to escape him; but
that was part of the fun.
</p><p>Frisky Squirrel laughed as Mr. Hawk went sailing by him. And then
something happened--something Frisky was not expecting. He heard a rush
through the air, and a nervous little wren screamed to him to look
out. Frisky didn't know what the trouble was; but he gave a great leap
to one side.
</p><p>He was just in time. He had hardly left the limb to which he had been
clinging when Mr. Hawk's wife went coursing past. You see, Mr. Hawk
had made up his mind that he was going to catch Frisky Squirrel, even
if he had to bring Mrs. Hawk along to help him.
