<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The disappearance of the canoe, although singular in itself,
had nothing supernatural about it. The shrubbery, which overhung
the water on either shore, offered a secure and impenetrable hiding-place,
and a few dexterous, vigorous strokes of the paddles were all
that was needed to send it beneath their shadows. That this had
been done, was plainly evident. Yet why had it been done? What
motive was there for concealment? And why, if apprehensive of
danger, had the Indians waited till they were in its vicinity?</p>

<p>These and numerous questions, I asked myself, as I carefully
retraced my steps down-stream again. The whole proceeding was
mysterious to me. I had, doubtless, exposed myself while watching
the canoe and its occupants, and thus betrayed to an enemy our
presence in their country. What would result from this, I could
not conjecture, and determined to make everything known to the
trapper. But then I felt somewhat fearful of this. He would, doubtless,
be incensed at my imprudent thoughtlessness, which might compel
him to leave a country offering such inducements to the trapper
and fur-trade; and I argued it was not certain that I had really
been seen by the Indians in question. If they meditated hostility,
Biddon would be warned soon enough for all purposes&mdash;and so I
decided to keep my own secret for the present.</p>

<p>But the question which occupied my thoughts, almost to the exclusion
of everything else, was the identity of the female in the canoe.
What could bring a white maiden to these wild regions of the northwest?
What meant her appearance in the canoe with two savage Indian
warriors? What if she was the child which Biddon had referred
to, as being captured upon the night of the massacre? This thought
intensified the interest I already felt in her. I believed <em>she</em>
had seen me; and her silent look toward the shore had something
more than curiosity in it. I imagined there was a mute, eloquent
appeal in those dark eyes.</p>

<p>Still ruminating upon this all-absorbing theme, I reached the
tree, and, stooping upon my hands and knees, crawled within it.
The movement had well-nigh cost me my life. As my head entered,
I encountered the alarmed visages of Nat and Biddon&mdash;the latter
with his knife drawn, and just preparing to spring upon me.</p>

<p>"You liked to got rubbed out that time!" he exclaimed, replacing
his weapon. "What made you forgit the sign?"</p>

<p>"It must have been because it did not occur to me," I laughed;
"I have had no occasion to use it before, and forgot it altogether;
but I will remember it, you may be assured, in future."</p>

<p>"You’d better, for I was just going to shoot, too," added Nat,
rising to his feet, and then seating himself again.</p>

<p>"You shoot!" repeated Biddon, contemptuously, "You’re shooter
ain’t loaded!"</p>

<p>"I forgot that. I wonder if I couldn’t load it, say?" he indignantly
demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, in course, if the reds waited fur yer."</p>

<p>Nat made no reply to this, except that of instantly proceeding
to load his piece. As it was near noon, the meal was prepared&mdash;this
time from the beaver’s body. The hair was singed off from a piece,
which was then cooked in the usual manner. This, although very
palatable, was not equal to the tail of the animal, the meat being
more tough and oily.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the trapper departed for the purpose of visiting
his traps, and setting new ones. When alone with Nat, I determined
to impart to him my morning’s experience.</p>

<p>"Nat, I have seen Indians," I remarked, in a quiet tone.</p>

<p>"You hain’t!" he exclaimed, starting up from his bed of skins
with such suddenness as to break the remains of his pipe.</p>

<p>"I have; and, what is considerably more, they have seen me."</p>

<p>"I should think it was considerably more, umph! What did you
do to them? I didn’t hear you shoot. Why didn’t you tell me before?
Why didn’t you&mdash;why, it seems to me you’re very cool about it."</p>

<p>"There is no occasion for excitement at all. Just remain quiet,
and I will tell you how it all happened."</p>

<p>And thereupon I related the particulars of the incident already
known to the reader. Nat’s wonder, excitement, and apprehension
were roused to the highest pitch at the narration. Springing to
his feet, he pulled his flattened hat violently over his forehead,
and striding about a moment, demanded:</p>

<p>"Why didn’t you tell Bill? Like as not he’ll be shot and scalped
before he gets back."</p>

<p>"I did not think it best," I returned. "Biddon is not the man
to walk into danger with his eyes shut, and if there is any cause
for fear, he will discover it soon enough."</p>

<p>"Suppose he will; but ain’t it terrible?"</p>

<p>"Isn’t what terrible?"</p>

<p>"Why, that we’re surrounded by Injins, thirsting for our blood!"</p>

<p>"We are not surrounded by Indians, Nat," I returned, reprovingly.</p>

<p>"I know; but then they are all around us. It won’t do to stick
our heads out, except at night, and then, like as not, we’ll be
shot for our trouble."</p>

<p>"You are not afraid, I hope."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! not a bit; but then you know it’s rather <em>unpleasant</em>
to feel that those infarnal Blackfeet (because this is the country
of the Blackfeet Injins) are all about you, and waiting for a
chance to shoot you from behind every bush."</p>

<p>"Nat," I commenced, earnestly, "you say you are not afraid of
Indians, and yet you show it in every word, look, and action.
There is no excuse for this. I saw only two savages, and a girl,
evidently a captive; no words or actions were exchanged between
us. They disappeared very suddenly and were, more probably, frightened
at my presence. I see nothing in this to excuse the excitement
and terror you have exhibited."</p>

<p>"I wonder what that girl is?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will have to wonder a long time, as I can see
no occasion for satisfying your curiosity."</p>

<p>"Is she good looking?" asked my companion, seriously.</p>

<p>"Very! What makes you ask that question?"</p>

<p>"I declare, if I don’t marry her, just to spite Alminy, and make
Bill Hawkins mad," he exclaimed, joyously.</p>

<p>At this point I could restrain my mirth no longer; but, as I
indulged it, I was considerably surprised to feel a slight twinge
of jealousy at his words. This discovery was painful.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will meet with several formidable obstacles,
before you can accomplish that; the most difficult of which will
be to obtain an audience with the fair one herself."</p>

<p>"Don’t suppose she’d be very anxious to see me; and I wouldn’t
care if I only had my pipe and jack-knife to pass away time with."</p>

<p>"I think it would be as well not to mention this affair to Biddon."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It can do no good, and he would be displeased at the thoughtlessness
I have evidenced. I do not think there are savages enough in the
vicinity to render us fearful of our safety. The canoe, I am disposed
to believe, belongs to some tribe quite distant from here."</p>

<p>"But what are they here for?"</p>

<p>"I can only conjecture. Biddon has never seen savages in this
particular section, and these may be returning from some journey
to their tribe."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, and may be not. These plagued Injins sometimes live
in one place and sometimes in another, you know, and it may be
that a notion has just entered their heads to come and live in
these parts."</p>

<p>"There is reason in what you say, but, as I stated, if danger
threatens, Biddon will undoubtedly detect its signs himself in
time."</p>

<p>"I think he will, though I shall feel a little flustered every
time he goes out. You remember when he was after the antelope,
he walked right among the Injins, without knowing it till it was
too late to stop."</p>

<p>"He did, it is true, but how nicely he walked out again. I tell
you, Nat, that fellow has nerve equal to any emergency. What man,
when conscious of an overwhelming foe being concealed within a
few feet of him, could have repressed every sign of trepidation
or fear, as he did, and bring the antelope through the same fearful
ordeal, with the same coolness and deliberation?"</p>

<p>"That was a clever thing, I allow."</p>

<p>"Biddon told me he felt a little nervous when he saw us start
to come up to him, for, if we had reached him, it would have been
all up with us. He called out to us, though we did not hear him,
that there were more animals in the grove, and our approach would
frighten them. The impatient Indians were thus held at bay, in
the hope of being offered a better opportunity to accomplish our
ruin, until it was too late to accomplish anything save the loss
of two or three of their number. Such a man, I repeat, will scent
danger soon enough without the help of others."</p>

<p>"He will, and I hope he’ll find out who that white girl is."</p>

<p>"Nat, do you remember the account Biddon gave some time ago of
a horrible massacre, upon the sandy island near where we encamped
one night?"</p>

<p>"I don’t think there is much likelihood of my ever forgetting
it."</p>

<p>"You will also recall his account of the capture of a small child
by the savages? Now, it has occurred to me that this is that child
grown to womanhood."</p>

<p>"I <em>know</em> it is!" exclaimed Nat, joyously.</p>

<p>"It is true there is much against it. It was a great distance
from here, but as these savages wander hundreds of miles at times,
it is not improbable, upon that ground. Instances are only too
common of persons spending their lives in captivity among these
Indian tribes. She is a captive, beyond a doubt, and must long
for restoration to her home and friends. If possible, I am bound
to know more of her."</p>

<p>"So am I!" exclaimed my excitable companion.</p>

<p>"As I said, we will say nothing of this to Biddon, until he discovers
signs of Indians himself. To-morrow, we will go forth together,
and spend the day in endeavoring to gain traces of the canoe and
its inmates; and if anything is discovered which is alarming,
we will impart it to him."</p>

<p>This Nat agreed to, and shortly after we heard three raps upon
the outside of the tree&mdash;the trapper’s signal of his presence.
A moment after, he made his appearance. He was considerably elated
at his prospect for a goodly quantity of furs; had set a number
of traps; was sure of half a dozen next day; had seen no signs
of Indians, and was convinced there were none in the vicinity.
None of us passed out again that day, but remained indulging in
our pipes and conversation as usual, until a late hour.</p>

<p>The next morning the trapper proposed that I should accompany
him upon his daily round. I complied, while Nat remained behind.</p>

<p>The day was as warm and pleasant as the preceding one, and the
forest and stream as delightful. Biddon paddled slowly up the
unrippled surface, and in a short time reached the first trap;
it had not been disturbed. Still hopeful, he passed on to the
second and third and all the others. But there were no signs of
beaver in any.</p>

<p>"Shoot me, that’s quar’!" he exclaimed, thoughtfully, as he saw
the last one. "I don’t understand it; I must git out and take
a look round."</p>

<p>He sprang ashore, and minutely examined the ground around. A
few seconds sufficed. He looked up with a gleam of deep meaning,
and said:</p>

<p>"Here’s the track of a thunderin’ moccasin. The reds have found
us out."</p>

<p>He stepped into the canoe, and taking the paddle moved it carefully
back again. He touched at each trap on the way. The footprints
of a stranger were visible at each.</p>

<p>"Thar’s been a beaver taken out of that one!" he remarked, as
the last one was reached. "It’s lucky for the sneakin’ coward
that I didn’t see him. He wouldn’t ’sturbed any more gentlemen’s
traps."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it is an Indian who has been annoying you?"</p>

<p>"Wogh! Don’t you s’pose I could tell a red’s track from a grizzly’s?"</p>

<p>"But it might have been a white man&mdash;some hunter or trapper?"
I suggested.</p>

<p>"A white man wouldn’t be mean ’nough to do sich a thing, ’less
it war some of those Hudson Bay fellers. They try them tricks
sometimes, but they git come up to. I catched a feller once from
Fort Hall at mine, and the way I walked into him war a caution;
but this ar’ an Injin’s track, sure."</p>

<p>"Do you suspect there could be a number in the vicinity?"</p>

<p>"Ef there war, I’d’ve heard of ’em afore. This is some varmint,
sneakin’ round yer, and he’s got to be rubbed out afore he makes
more trouble."</p>

<p>"I fear that will be a difficult and dangerous job."</p>

<p>"Let me be for that."</p>

<p>Shortly after we reached our home, and running the canoe beneath
the bushes, entered it. We were somewhat surprised to find Nat
absent. He returned, however, in a short time, and I saw at once
by his nervous, flustered manner that something unusual had occurred.
Biddon questioned him rather closely, as he suspected something,
but Nat evaded his inquiries, and would not admit that he had
seen anything to excite alarm or apprehension.</p>

<p>"I’m goin’ out, and when I come back I’ll tell you what’s the
matter with them traps," said Biddon, seizing his rifle and departing.</p>

<p>I waited until he was beyond hearing, and then turning to my
companion, asked,</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, Nat?"</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked, in turn, with a start.</p>

<p>"Because you show plainly that something has occurred to alarm
you."</p>

<p>He remained silent a moment, and then seizing his hat, jerked
it off his head, and threw it spitefully down, where he gazed
at it a second, and exclaimed,</p>

<p>"I’m sick of this."</p>

<p>"Sick of what?"</p>

<p>"Why, of being in this fix."</p>

<p>"I don’t understand you. Please explain what you mean."</p>

<p>"I should think you ought to know."</p>

<p>"But I do not."</p>

<p>"Why, this wood is full of Injins; they’re behind every tree
and stump, and in every bush, and you can hardly step without
pitching over some painted heathen."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are exaggerating," I answered, suppressing a
smile which was struggling at the corners of my mouth.</p>

<p>"No, I ain’t. I swow there are ten thousand Injins just waiting
outside to pounce upon us."</p>

<p>"You are talking nonsense, and you know it."</p>

<p>"Well, there’s <em>one</em> Injin, for I seen him. Come now,"
he affirmed, as if the matter was now settled beyond a question.</p>

<p>"Ah! that alters the case considerably. I shouldn’t wonder at
all if there is one or a half-dozen savages in the forest."</p>

<p>"If you see <em>one</em> savage haven’t you a right to suppose
there’s a hundred more about, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Not always, Nat; I have seen three myself, yet I do not believe
there is another one in the neighborhood. But I have not heard
the particulars of this affair of which you have been speaking.
Please let me hear them."</p>

<p>"There isn’t much to tell, but there is enough to make you do
a heap of thinking. You see, after you had left, I took a notion
that I must have a morning ramble; and I thought, too, there might
be such a thing as you two running into danger and needing my
help (I should like to know what you are laughing at). So, on
the whole, there was no hesitation upon my part. Taking my rifle
out, I was soon making my way as noiselessly as possible, in a
direction from the river.</p>

<p>"I hadn’t gone more than a dozen yards before I commenced thinking
about Injins, and came nigh going back again. I wasn’t afraid
at all, you know, but then it appeared to me I might bring you
and Biddon into trouble. However, I kept on. I had gone some distance
further, when all of a sudden I heard a terrible whirr and rattle,
and jumped clean off my feet. But it was only a big owl which
I had stirred up. I was so provoked at the start he gave me, that
I should have wrung his neck had I got my hands upon him. But
I went on. Pretty soon I reached a little stream of water, and
as I jumped across, what do you suppose I saw in the sand?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I cannot tell."</p>

<p>"Nothing less than a big moccasin track. And what was more, it
hadn’t been made there a week before! I stood and looked at it
a good while, cogitating some wonderful things. At last I stooped
and went to measuring it. I was just going to rise, when I heard
a grunt right by me. I jumped up so quick&mdash;to be ready, you know&mdash;that
I floundered backward into the water. And I may be shot if there
wasn’t a big painted Injin standing not ten feet off. He didn’t
say a word, but just stood and looked at me with them awful eyes
of his. As soon as I could think, I raised my gun, took a quick
aim, and pulled the trigger; but the infernal gun snapped. I pulled
it again, but it wouldn’t go, and I just happened to think the
thing wasn’t loaded. All this time the painted imp stood grinning
at me, without saying a word, except to kinder grunt. He had a
big shining gun in one hand, and I was dreadful afraid he would
shoot it. I told him not to stir, but to stand still till I got
mine loaded, and he waited. But somehow or other, I s’pose I was
in such a hurry that things wouldn’t go right. Instead of putting
the powder in the gun-barrel, I crammed it in my pocket, and jammed
the ramrod into my shoe. I told the Injin to have patience and
I’d get it loaded in a minute. I got it fixed somehow at last
and hauled it up to my shoulder, when, no Injin was there! I looked
behind, all about me, and up into the trees but he’d been spirited
away somewhere. However, I made up my mind to shoot at the spot
where he had stood, and I up and blazed away. That is, I blazed
away without the gun going off. I believe he spirited that too."</p>

<p>"Let me examine it. Perhaps you made some blunder."</p>

<p>"No, I’m sure I didn’t."</p>

<p>I took the rifle, with a smile of certainty that I should find
something the matter with it. Sure enough the muzzle was crammed
with paper, and upon removing it, <em>a pipestem</em>, broken
in pieces, rolled out, while there was not a grain of powder in
the barrel.</p>

<p>"I declare, I forgot about the powder!" exclaimed Nat, opening
his eyes in wonder.</p>

<p>"But not about the bullet," I laughed, pointing to the fragments
of his pipe.</p>

<p>"How’d that get there?" he angrily asked.</p>

<p>"That’s the question."</p>

<p>"I didn’t put it there."</p>

<p>"Who did, then?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know, I declare."</p>

<p>Nat picked up the fragments and examined them carefully.</p>

<p>"That’s my pipe sure; and I had it in my mouth, I remember when
I started out, and missed it coming back. I didn’t put it in the
gun though."</p>

<p>"Let it pass then. Did you see no more of your Indian friend?"</p>

<p>"No; he knew enough to keep out of my way. I waited a long time
for him, and at last started home again. I kept an eye on every
suspicious object, but as I just said, seen nothing."</p>

<p>At this point I gave free vent to my pent-up mirth. Nat, much
astonished, looked wonderingly at me, seemingly at a loss to understand
the cause.</p>

<p>"I do not see what there is to laugh at," he remarked, reprovingly.
"If it’s a laughing matter to know that there are Injins all about
you, why you must laugh."</p>

<p>"Your adventure with the Indian, Nat, and the singular load in
your rifle appears to me to be a funny matter, and I trust you
will pardon me if&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Didn’t I tell you I didn’t put it in there? It was the Injin’s
work."</p>

<p>And to this day Nat cannot be made to believe that he was instrumental
in introducing the pipe into his gun.</p>

<p>After a few more unimportant remarks, the conversation ceased.
Nat’s adventure began to appear to me in a different light from
that in which I had viewed it at first. I doubted not but that
he was perfectly honest and truthful in what he said. But why,
when exposed to the will of the savage, did he escape unscathed?
Why did the latter stand fearless and harmless before him? And
what meant these strange signs, these "footprints," which were
becoming visible around us? Matters were assuming a puzzling form.
We were being environed by Indians without any evidence of hostility
upon their part. What meant it? Surely there was a meaning too
deep and hidden for us to divine as yet.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nat spoke.</p>

<p>"Don’t you remember the canoe? We were going to hunt for that
to-day!"</p>

<p>"Ah! how did I forget that? But had we not better wait till Biddon
returns?"</p>

<p>"No; let us go at once. Hark! what’s that?"</p>

<p>I held my breath, as the distant report of a rifle reached our
ears. The next instant came a sound, faint and far away yet clear
and distinct&mdash;a horrid, unearthly sound, as the cry of a being
in mortal agony!</p>
