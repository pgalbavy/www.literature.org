<p>_(Anne’s Narrative Resumed)_
</p>
<p>It was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that
the time had come for me to confide in some one. So far I had
played a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything
was changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time
a feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me.
</p><p>I sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and
considered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had
seemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no
fool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of
commanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my
hands. And it was <u>my</u> mystery! There were other reasons, too,
which I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it
inadvisable to confide in Colonel Race.
</p><p>Then I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me. I did
not delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything.
It was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it
in my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced
most of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her
with an extraordinary one! And I liked her; liked her ease of
manner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of
affectation.
</p><p>My mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She
would hardly be in bed yet.
</p><p>Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin. My
friend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell.
After some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the
information I wanted. Mrs. Blair’s cabin was No. 71. He apologized
for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all
the cabins to attend to.
</p><p>“Where is the stewardess, then?” I asked.
</p><p>“They all go off duty at ten o’clock.”
</p><p>“No—I mean the night stewardess.”
</p><p>“No stewardess on at night, miss.”
</p><p>“But—but a stewardess came the other night—about one o’clock.”
</p><p>“You must have been dreaming, miss. There’s no stewardess on duty
after ten.”
</p><p>He withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information.
Who was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the
22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity
of my unknown antagonists. Then, pulling myself together, I left
my own cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair. I knocked at the door.
</p><p>“Who’s that?” called her voice from within.
</p><p>“It’s me—Anne Beddingfeld.”
</p><p>“Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.”
</p><p>I entered. A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs.
Blair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever
seen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water
to look at it.
</p><p>“Mrs. Blair,” I said abruptly, “I want to tell you the story of my
life—that is, if it isn’t too late, and you won’t be bored.”
</p><p>“Not a bit. I always hate going to bed,” said Mrs. Blair, her face
crinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. “And I should
love to hear the story of your life. You’re a most unusual creature,
Gipsy girl. Nobody else would think of bursting in on me at 1 a.m.
to tell me the story of their life. Especially after snubbing my
natural curiosity for weeks as you have done! I’m not accustomed
to being snubbed. It’s been quite a pleasing novelty. Sit down on
the sofa and unburden your soul.”
</p><p>I told her the whole story. It took some time as I was conscientious
over all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished,
but she did not say at all what I had expected her to say. Instead
she looked at me, laughed a little and said:
</p><p>“Do you know, Anne, you’re a very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever
had qualms?”
</p><p>“Qualms?” I asked, puzzled.
</p><p>“Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically
no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange
country with all your money gone?”
</p><p>“It’s no good bothering about that until it comes. I’ve got plenty
of money still. The twenty-five pounds that Mrs. Flemming gave me
is practically intact, and then I won the sweep yesterday. That’s
another fifteen pounds. Why, I’ve got <u>lots</u> of money. Forty
pounds!”
</p><p>“Lots of money! My God!” murmured Mrs. Blair. <u>“I</u> couldn’t do it,
Anne, and I’ve plenty of pluck in my own way. I couldn’t start off
gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was
doing and where I was going.”
</p><p>“But that’s the fun of it,” I cried, thoroughly roused. “It gives
one such a splendid feeling of adventure.”
</p><p>She looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled.
</p><p>“Lucky Anne! There aren’t many people in the world who feel as you
do.”
</p><p>“Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs.
Blair?”
</p><p>“I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin
with, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so
much better. Is that agreed?”
</p><p>“I should love it, Suzanne.”
</p><p>“Good girl. Now let’s get down to business. You say that in Sir
Eustace’s secretary—not that long-faced Pagett, the other one—you
recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for
shelter?”
</p><p>I nodded.
</p><p>“That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle.
The woman was murdered in <u>his</u> house, and it’s <u>his</u> secretary
who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock. I don’t suspect
Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a
connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.”
</p><p>“Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued
thoughtfully. “What was she like?”
</p><p>“I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up—and a
stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But—yes—I did think her face
was familiar. Of course it would be if I’d seen her about the
ship.”
</p><p>“Her face seemed familiar to you,” said Suzanne. “Sure she wasn’t
a man?”
</p><p>“She was very tall,” I admitted.
</p><p>“Hum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. Pagett——Wait!”
</p><p>She caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly. She
inspected the result with her head poised on one side.
</p><p>“A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the
etceteras.” She passed the paper over to me. “Is that your
stewardess?”
</p><p>“Why, yes,” I cried. “Suzanne, how clever of you!”
</p><p>She disdained the compliment with a light gesture.
</p><p>“I’ve always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you
remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green
when we were discussing Crippen the other day?”
</p><p>“And he tried to get Cabin 17!”
</p><p>“Yes, it all fits in so far. But what does it all <u>mean?</u> What was
really meant to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the
stabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that
for a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must
have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep
it when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly
not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have
been with Pagett.”
</p><p>“That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any
time.”
</p><p>We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off
on another tack.
</p><p>“Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?”
</p><p>“That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things
being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden
there, I’m sure of it.”
</p><p>“The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the
night before?”
</p><p>I shook my head.
</p><p>“I should have seen him.”
</p><p>“Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking
for?”
</p><p>“It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a
time and a date—and they were both past by then.”
</p><p>Suzanne nodded.
</p><p>“That’s so of course. No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, have
you got it with you? I’d rather like to see it.”
</p><p>I had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I handed it over
to her. She scrutinized it, frowning.
</p><p>“There’s a dot after the 17. Why isn’t there a dot after the 1
too?”
</p><p>“There’s a space,” I pointed out.
</p><p>“Yes, there’s a space, but——”
</p><p>Suddenly she rose and peered at the paper, holding it as close
under the light as possible. There was a repressed excitement in
her manner.
</p><p>“Anne, that isn’t a dot! That’s a flaw in the paper! A flaw in the
paper, you see? So you’ve got to ignore it, and just go by the
spaces—the spaces!”
</p><p>I had risen and was standing by her. I read out the figures as I
now saw them.
</p><p>“1 71 22.”
</p><p>“You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not quite. It’s one
o’clock still, and the 22nd—but it’s Cabin 71! <u>My</u> cabin, Anne!”
</p><p>We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery
and so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had
solved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump.
</p><p>“But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?”
</p><p>Her face fell also. “No—it didn’t.”
</p><p>Another idea struck me.
</p><p>“This isn’t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you
originally booked?”
</p><p>“No, the purser changed me into it.”
</p><p>“I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one—some one
who didn’t turn up. I suppose we could find out.”
</p><p>“We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” cried Suzanne. “I know!
The purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the
name of Mrs. Grey—but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym
for the famous Madame Nadina. She’s a celebrated Russian dancer,
you know. She’s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite
mad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the
War. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive. The
purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board in a most
heart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race
told me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories
afloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn’t
prove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply
on that account. He’s told me some very interesting things. There
was a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all. In fact
the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was
thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his
identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable
organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages,
assaults, he undertook them all—and usually provided an innocent
scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have
been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they
couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the
right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this
business. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her
in this cabin. But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?”
</p><p>A light flashed upon me.
</p><p>“She meant to sail,” I said slowly.
</p><p>“Then why didn’t she?”
</p><p><u>“Because she was dead.</u> Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at
Marlow!”
</p><p>My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there
swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil.
With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of
the roll of films. A roll of films—that struck a more recent note.
Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that
thought with Mrs. Blair?
</p><p>Suddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement.
</p><p>“Your films! The ones that were passed to you through the
ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?”
</p><p>“The ones I lost?”
</p><p>“How do you know they were the same? Why would any one return them
to you that way—in the middle of the night? It’s a mad idea.
No—they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow
tin case, and something else put inside. Have you got it still?”
</p><p>“I may have used it. No, here it is. I remember I tossed it into
the rack at the side of the bunk.”
</p><p>She held it out to me.
</p><p>It was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in
for the tropics. I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did
so my heart leapt. It was noticeably heavier than it should have
been.
</p><p>With shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster
that kept it air-tight. I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull
glassy pebbles rolled onto the bed.
</p><p>“Pebbles,” I said, keenly disappointed.
</p><p>“Pebbles?” cried Suzanne.
</p><p>The ring in her voice excited me.
</p><p>“Pebbles? No, Anne, not pebbles! _Diamonds!”_
