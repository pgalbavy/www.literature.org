<P>On the 20th of August, 1672, the city of the Hague, always 
so lively, so neat, and so trim that one might believe every 
day to be Sunday, with its shady park, with its tall trees, 
spreading over its Gothic houses, with its canals like large 
mirrors, in which its steeples and its almost Eastern 
cupolas are reflected,  -  the city of the Hague, the capital 
of the Seven United Provinces, was swelling in all its 
arteries with a black and red stream of hurried, panting, 
and restless citizens, who, with their knives in their 
girdles, muskets on their shoulders, or sticks in their 
hands, were pushing on to the Buytenhof, a terrible prison, 
the grated windows of which are still shown, where, on the 
charge of attempted murder preferred against him by the 
surgeon Tyckelaer, Cornelius de Witt, the brother of the 
Grand Pensionary of Holland was confined.</P>
<P>If the history of that time, and especially that of the year 
in the middle of which our narrative commences, were not 
indissolubly connected with the two names just mentioned, 
the few explanatory pages which we are about to add might 
appear quite supererogatory; but we will, from the very 
first, apprise the reader  -  our old friend, to whom we are 
wont on the first page to promise amusement, and with whom 
we always try to keep our word as well as is in our power  -  
that this explanation is as indispensable to the right 
understanding of our story as to that of the great event 
itself on which it is based.</P>
<P>Cornelius de Witt, Ruart de Pulten, that is to say, warden 
of the dikes, ex-burgomaster of Dort, his native town, and 
member of the Assembly of the States of Holland, was 
forty-nine years of age, when the Dutch people, tired of the 
Republic such as John de Witt, the Grand Pensionary of 
Holland, understood it, at once conceived a most violent 
affection for the Stadtholderate, which had been abolished 
for ever in Holland by the &quot;Perpetual Edict&quot; forced by John 
de Witt upon the United Provinces.</P>
<P>As it rarely happens that public opinion, in its whimsical 
flights, does not identify a principle with a man, thus the 
people saw the personification of the Republic in the two 
stern figures of the brothers De Witt, those Romans of 
Holland, spurning to pander to the fancies of the mob, and 
wedding themselves with unbending fidelity to liberty 
without licentiousness, and prosperity without the waste of 
superfluity; on the other hand, the Stadtholderate recalled 
to the popular mind the grave and thoughtful image of the 
young Prince William of Orange.</P>
<P>The brothers De Witt humoured Louis XIV., whose moral 
influence was felt by the whole of Europe, and the pressure 
of whose material power Holland had been made to feel in 
that marvellous campaign on the Rhine, which, in the space 
of three months, had laid the power of the United Provinces 
prostrate.</P>
<P>Louis XIV. had long been the enemy of the Dutch, who 
insulted or ridiculed him to their hearts' content, although 
it must be said that they generally used French refugees for 
the mouthpiece of their spite. Their national pride held him 
up as the Mithridates of the Republic. The brothers De Witt, 
therefore, had to strive against a double difficulty,  -  
against the force of national antipathy, and, besides, 
against the feeling of weariness which is natural to all 
vanquished people, when they hope that a new chief will be 
able to save them from ruin and shame.</P>
<P>This new chief, quite ready to appear on the political 
stage, and to measure himself against Louis XIV., however 
gigantic the fortunes of the Grand Monarch loomed in the 
future, was William, Prince of Orange, son of William II., 
and grandson, by his mother Henrietta Stuart, of Charles I. 
of England. We have mentioned him before as the person by 
whom the people expected to see the office of Stadtholder 
restored.</P>
<P>This young man was, in 1672, twenty-two years of age. John 
de Witt, who was his tutor, had brought him up with the view 
of making him a good citizen. Loving his country better than 
he did his disciple, the master had, by the Perpetual Edict, 
extinguished the hope which the young Prince might have 
entertained of one day becoming Stadtholder. But God laughs 
at the presumption of man, who wants to raise and prostrate 
the powers on earth without consulting the King above; and 
the fickleness and caprice of the Dutch combined with the 
terror inspired by Louis XIV., in repealing the Perpetual 
Edict, and re-establishing the office of Stadtholder in 
favour of William of Orange, for whom the hand of Providence 
had traced out ulterior destinies on the hidden map of the 
future.</P>
<P>The Grand Pensionary bowed before the will of his fellow 
citizens; Cornelius de Witt, however, was more obstinate, 
and notwithstanding all the threats of death from the 
Orangist rabble, who besieged him in his house at Dort, he 
stoutly refused to sign the act by which the office of 
Stadtholder was restored. Moved by the tears and entreaties 
of his wife, he at last complied, only adding to his 
signature the two letters V. C. (Vi Coactus), notifying 
thereby that he only yielded to force.</P>
<P>It was a real miracle that on that day he escaped from the 
doom intended for him.</P>
<P>John de Witt derived no advantage from his ready compliance 
with the wishes of his fellow citizens. Only a few days 
after, an attempt was made to stab him, in which he was 
severely although not mortally wounded.</P>
<P>This by no means suited the views of the Orange faction. The 
life of the two brothers being a constant obstacle to their 
plans, they changed their tactics, and tried to obtain by 
calumny what they had not been able to effect by the aid of 
the poniard.</P>
<P>How rarely does it happen that, in the right moment, a great 
man is found to head the execution of vast and noble 
designs; and for that reason, when such a providential 
concurrence of circumstances does occur, history is prompt 
to record the name of the chosen one, and to hold him up to 
the admiration of posterity. But when Satan interposes in 
human affairs to cast a shadow upon some happy existence, or 
to overthrow a kingdom, it seldom happens that he does not 
find at his side some miserable tool, in whose ear he has 
but to whisper a word to set him at once about his task.</P>
<P>The wretched tool who was at hand to be the agent of this 
dastardly plot was one Tyckelaer whom we have already 
mentioned, a surgeon by profession.</P>
<P>He lodged an information against Cornelius de Witt, setting 
forth that the warden  -  who, as he had shown by the letters 
added to his signature, was fuming at the repeal of the 
Perpetual Edict  -  had, from hatred against William of 
Orange, hired an assassin to deliver the new Republic of its 
new Stadtholder; and he, Tyckelaer was the person thus 
chosen; but that, horrified at the bare idea of the act 
which he was asked to perpetrate, he had preferred rather to 
reveal the crime than to commit it.</P>
<P>This disclosure was, indeed, well calculated to call forth a 
furious outbreak among the Orange faction. The Attorney 
General caused, on the 16th of August, 1672, Cornelius de 
Witt to be arrested; and the noble brother of John de Witt 
had, like the vilest criminal, to undergo, in one of the 
apartments of the town prison, the preparatory degrees of 
torture, by means of which his judges expected to force from 
him the confession of his alleged plot against William of 
Orange.</P>
<P>But Cornelius was not only possessed of a great mind, but 
also of a great heart. He belonged to that race of martyrs 
who, indissolubly wedded to their political convictions as 
their ancestors were to their faith, are able to smile on 
pain: while being stretched on the rack, he recited with a 
firm voice, and scanning the lines according to measure, the 
first strophe of the &quot;Justum ac tenacem&quot; of Horace, and, 
making no confession, tired not only the strength, but even 
the fanaticism, of his executioners.</P>
<P>The judges, notwithstanding, acquitted Tyckelaer from every 
charge; at the same time sentencing Cornelius to be deposed 
from all his offices and dignities; to pay all the costs of 
the trial; and to be banished from the soil of the Republic 
for ever.</P>
<P>This judgment against not only an innocent, but also a great 
man, was indeed some gratification to the passions of the 
people, to whose interests Cornelius de Witt had always 
devoted himself: but, as we shall soon see, it was not 
enough.</P>
<P>The Athenians, who indeed have left behind them a pretty 
tolerable reputation for ingratitude, have in this respect 
to yield precedence to the Dutch. They, at least in the case 
of Aristides, contented themselves with banishing him.</P>
<P>John de Witt, at the first intimation of the charge brought 
against his brother, had resigned his office of Grand 
Pensionary. He too received a noble recompense for his 
devotedness to the best interests of his country, taking 
with him into the retirement of private life the hatred of a 
host of enemies, and the fresh scars of wounds inflicted by 
assassins, only too often the sole guerdon obtained by 
honest people, who are guilty of having worked for their 
country, and of having forgotten their own private 
interests.</P>
<P>In the meanwhile William of Orange urged on the course of 
events by every means in his power, eagerly waiting for the 
time when the people, by whom he was idolised, should have 
made of the bodies of the brothers the two steps over which 
he might ascend to the chair of Stadtholder.</P>
<P>Thus, then, on the 20th of August, 1672, as we have already 
stated in the beginning of this chapter, the whole town was 
crowding towards the Buytenhof, to witness the departure of 
Cornelius de Witt from prison, as he was going to exile; and 
to see what traces the torture of the rack had left on the 
noble frame of the man who knew his Horace so well.</P>
<P>Yet all this multitude was not crowding to the Buytenhof 
with the innocent view of merely feasting their eyes with 
the spectacle; there were many who went there to play an 
active part in it, and to take upon themselves an office 
which they conceived had been badly filled,  -  that of the 
executioner.</P>
<P>There were, indeed, others with less hostile intentions. All 
that they cared for was the spectacle, always so attractive 
to the mob, whose instinctive pride is flattered by it,  -  
the sight of greatness hurled down into the dust.</P>
<P>&quot;Has not,&quot; they would say, &quot;this Cornelius de Witt been 
locked up and broken by the rack? Shall we not see him pale, 
streaming with blood, covered with shame?&quot; And was not this 
a sweet triumph for the burghers of the Hague, whose envy 
even beat that of the common rabble; a triumph in which 
every honest citizen and townsman might be expected to 
share?</P>
<P>&quot;Moreover,&quot; hinted the Orange agitators interspersed through 
the crowd, whom they hoped to manage like a sharp-edged and 
at the same time crushing instrument,  -  &quot;moreover, will 
there not, from the Buytenhof to the gate of the town, a 
nice little opportunity present itself to throw some 
handfuls of dirt, or a few stones, at this Cornelius de 
Witt, who not only conferred the dignity of Stadtholder on 
the Prince of Orange merely vi coactus, but who also 
intended to have him assassinated?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Besides which,&quot; the fierce enemies of France chimed in, &quot;if 
the work were done well and bravely at the Hague, Cornelius 
would certainly not be allowed to go into exile, where he 
will renew his intrigues with France, and live with his big 
scoundrel of a brother, John, on the gold of the Marquis de 
Louvois.&quot;</P>
<P>Being in such a temper, people generally will run rather 
than walk; which was the reason why the inhabitants of the 
Hague were hurrying so fast towards the Buytenhof.</P>
<P>Honest Tyckelaer, with a heart full of spite and malice, and 
with no particular plan settled in his mind, was one of the 
foremost, being paraded about by the Orange party like a 
hero of probity, national honour, and Christian charity.</P>
<P>This daring miscreant detailed, with all the embellishments 
and flourishes suggested by his base mind and his ruffianly 
imagination, the attempts which he pretended Cornelius de 
Witt had made to corrupt him; the sums of money which were 
promised, and all the diabolical stratagems planned 
beforehand to smooth for him, Tyckelaer, all the 
difficulties in the path of murder.</P>
<P>And every phase of his speech, eagerly listened to by the 
populace, called forth enthusiastic cheers for the Prince of 
Orange, and groans and imprecations of blind fury against 
the brothers De Witt.</P>
<P>The mob even began to vent its rage by inveighing against 
the iniquitous judges, who had allowed such a detestable 
criminal as the villain Cornelius to get off so cheaply.</P>
<P>Some of the agitators whispered, &quot;He will be off, he will 
escape from us!&quot;</P>
<P>Others replied, &quot;A vessel is waiting for him at Schevening, 
a French craft. Tyckelaer has seen her.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Honest Tyckelaer! Hurrah for Tyckelaer!&quot; the mob cried in 
chorus.</P>
<P>&quot;And let us not forget,&quot; a voice exclaimed from the crowd, 
&quot;that at the same time with Cornelius his brother John, who 
is as rascally a traitor as himself, will likewise make his 
escape.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And the two rogues will in France make merry with our 
money, with the money for our vessels, our arsenals, and our 
dockyards, which they have sold to Louis XIV.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, don't let us allow them to depart!&quot; advised one 
of the patriots who had gained the start of the others.</P>
<P>&quot;Forward to the prison, to the prison!&quot; echoed the crowd.</P>
<P>Amid these cries, the citizens ran along faster and faster, 
cocking their muskets, brandishing their hatchets, and 
looking death and defiance in all directions.</P>
<P>No violence, however, had as yet been committed; and the 
file of horsemen who were guarding the approaches of the 
Buytenhof remained cool, unmoved, silent, much more 
threatening in their impassibility than all this crowd of 
burghers, with their cries, their agitation, and their 
threats. The men on their horses, indeed, stood like so many 
statues, under the eye of their chief, Count Tilly, the 
captain of the mounted troops of the Hague, who had his 
sword drawn, but held it with its point downwards, in a line 
with the straps of his stirrup.</P>
<P>This troop, the only defence of the prison, overawed by its 
firm attitude not only the disorderly riotous mass of the 
populace, but also the detachment of the burgher guard, 
which, being placed opposite the Buytenhof to support the 
soldiers in keeping order, gave to the rioters the example 
of seditious cries, shouting,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Hurrah for Orange! Down with the traitors!&quot;</P>
<P>The presence of Tilly and his horsemen, indeed, exercised a 
salutary check on these civic warriors; but by degrees they 
waxed more and more angry by their own shouts, and as they 
were not able to understand how any one could have courage 
without showing it by cries, they attributed the silence of 
the dragoons to pusillanimity, and advanced one step towards 
the prison, with all the turbulent mob following in their 
wake.</P>
<P>In this moment, Count Tilly rode forth towards them 
single-handed, merely lifting his sword and contracting his 
brow whilst he addressed them:  - </P>
<P>&quot;Well, gentlemen of the burgher guard, what are you 
advancing for, and what do you wish?&quot;</P>
<P>The burghers shook their muskets, repeating their cry,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Hurrah for Orange! Death to the traitors!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;'Hurrah for Orange!' all well and good!&quot; replied Tilly, 
&quot;although I certainly am more partial to happy faces than to 
gloomy ones. 'Death to the traitors!' as much of it as you 
like, as long as you show your wishes only by cries. But, as 
to putting them to death in good earnest, I am here to 
prevent that, and I shall prevent it.&quot;</P>
<P>Then, turning round to his men, he gave the word of command, 
 - </P>
<P>&quot;Soldiers, ready!&quot;</P>
<P>The troopers obeyed orders with a precision which 
immediately caused the burgher guard and the people to fall 
back, in a degree of confusion which excited the smile of 
the cavalry officer.</P>
<P>&quot;Holloa!&quot; he exclaimed, with that bantering tone which is 
peculiar to men of his profession; &quot;be easy, gentlemen, my 
soldiers will not fire a shot; but, on the other hand, you 
will not advance by one step towards the prison.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And do you know, sir, that we have muskets?&quot; roared the 
commandant of the burghers.</P>
<P>&quot;I must know it, by Jove, you have made them glitter enough 
before my eyes; but I beg you to observe also that we on our 
side have pistols, that the pistol carries admirably to a 
distance of fifty yards, and that you are only twenty-five 
from us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Death to the traitors!&quot; cried the exasperated burghers.</P>
<P>&quot;Go along with you,&quot; growled the officer, &quot;you always cry 
the same thing over again. It is very tiresome.&quot;</P>
<P>With this, he took his post at the head of his troops, 
whilst the tumult grew fiercer and fiercer about the 
Buytenhof.</P>
<P>And yet the fuming crowd did not know that, at that very 
moment when they were tracking the scent of one of their 
victims, the other, as if hurrying to meet his fate, passed, 
at a distance of not more than a hundred yards, behind the 
groups of people and the dragoons, to betake himself to the 
Buytenhof.</P>
<P>John de Witt, indeed, had alighted from his coach with his 
servant, and quietly walked across the courtyard of the 
prison.</P>
<P>Mentioning his name to the turnkey, who however knew him, he 
said,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Good morning, Gryphus; I am coming to take away my brother, 
who, as you know, is condemned to exile, and to carry him 
out of the town.&quot;</P>
<P>Whereupon the jailer, a sort of bear, trained to lock and 
unlock the gates of the prison, had greeted him and admitted 
him into the building, the doors of which were immediately 
closed again.</P>
<P>Ten yards farther on, John de Witt met a lovely young girl, 
of about seventeen or eighteen, dressed in the national 
costume of the Frisian women, who, with pretty demureness, 
dropped a curtesy to him. Chucking her under the chin, he 
said to her,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Good morning, my good and fair Rosa; how is my brother?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Mynheer John!&quot; the young girl replied, &quot;I am not afraid 
of the harm which has been done to him. That's all over 
now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But what is it you are afraid of?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am afraid of the harm which they are going to do to him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said De Witt, &quot;you mean to speak of the people 
down below, don't you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you hear them?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They are indeed in a state of great excitement; but when 
they see us perhaps they will grow calmer, as we have never 
done them anything but good.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's unfortunately no reason, except for the contrary,&quot; 
muttered the girl, as, on an imperative sign from her 
father, she withdrew.</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed, child, what you say is only too true.&quot;</P>
<P>Then, in pursuing his way, he said to himself,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Here is a damsel who very likely does not know how to read, 
who consequently has never read anything, and yet with one 
word she has just told the whole history of the world.&quot;</P>
<P>And with the same calm mien, but more melancholy than he had 
been on entering the prison, the Grand Pensionary proceeded 
towards the cell of his brother. </P></article>
