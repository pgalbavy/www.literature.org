<p>In the morning when our friends started upon their day’s march,
Haldidge, as said, fell behind in order to guard against surprise
from this direction. Although expecting as little as did Seth
any demonstration from this quarter, still he was too much of
a backwoodsman to allow himself to lose any of his usual suspicion
and watchfulness. Sometimes he would take his back trail for a
long distance, and then wander off to the right or left of it
for perhaps a mile or more. By this means, he kept a continual
watch not only upon the trail itself but upon the neighborhood
for a long distance around it, and, in case of pursuit, made so
many and conflicting tracks, that it could not but puzzle and
delay their enemies.</p>

<p>Near noon, and at the very moment that Seth paused to take a
survey of the suspicious valley-like depression, and when not
more than a furlong in the rear, Haldidge caught sight of three
Indians just ahead of him. They were sitting upon the ground,
in perfect silence, and seemingly waiting for the approach of
some one. The hunter found himself as much perplexed, as was Seth
to account for what he saw. Whether it was some stratagem to entrap
himself or not he could not tell, but before venturing farther,
he made up his mind to gain a further knowledge of their intentions.</p>

<p>Haldidge had one formidable difficulty to contend with: the wood
at this particular spot was open, and almost devoid of the protecting
undergrowth, so that it was about impossible to approach them
closer without discovering himself to them. He noticed lying a
short distance behind them a large, heavy log, apparently much
decayed. In fact this was so near them, that could he gain it,
he could overhear every thing said. He had a slight knowledge
of the Mohawk tongue&mdash;not enough to converse in it&mdash;but still
enough to understand the drift of a conversation. Accordingly
he determined to reach the spot at all hazards.</p>

<p>Haldidge desired, if possible, to communicate with Haverland
and warn him of the proximity of danger. To do this, it was necessary
to make a long <em>detour</em>, and upon further consideration
he decided not to attempt it. Lying flat upon his face, he worked
himself toward the log mentioned, keeping it between himself and
the Indians, and approaching as silently and steadily as a snake.
So cautiously and carefully was it done, that it required at least
twenty minutes to reach it, and all this time, the Indians maintained
the same unbroken silence. At length, the concealment was reached,
and the hunter noticed with pleasure that it was hollow. He lost
no time in entering it, where, coiling himself up in as small
a space as possible, he took himself to listening. As if to completely
favor him, there was a small rent in the log, through which even
the whisper of the savages could be heard, and which also admitted
a thin ray of light.</p>

<p>Here Haldidge cramped himself up and listened intently. But not
a word was exchanged between the Indians, who remained as motionless
as statues. In the course of a few minutes he heard a footfall
upon the leaves, and a second after several savages seated themselves
upon the very log in which he had concealed himself! He judged
that there were at least a half dozen. Those whom he had first
seen appeared to have risen, and, meeting the others, they had
all seated themselves upon the log together.</p>

<p>They immediately commenced conversing in so low and guttural
tones, that their deep base voices communicated their tremor to
the log. Haldidge started as he soon learned that they were conversing
about himself and the three fugitives. Of Seth they seemed to
have no knowledge. He discovered that they had lain in ambush
a short distance ahead to entrap Haverland, Graham, and Ina, and
they were debating how <em>he</em> should be disposed of. They
knew that he was acting in the capacity of scout and sentinel,
and were fearful that he might detect the ambush, or at least
escape it himself.</p>

<p>At this point, one of the Indians, probably impelled by some
whim, stooped and looked into the log. Haldidge knew from the
darkness thus occasioned, that one of them was peering in it,
and he scarcely breathed for a few seconds. But the face was removed,
and the hollow being dark within&mdash;the small rent being upon the
opposite side of the hunter&mdash;the savage felt reassured and resumed
the conversation.</p>

<p>But Haldidge was doomed to have a trial of his nerves, of which
he little dreamed. When he entered the log, it was head foremost,
so that his feet were toward the opening, and his face was in
the dim light beyond. He judged the rotten cavity extended several
feet further back; but, as there was no necessity for entering
farther, he did not attempt to explore it. It was while he lay
thus, his whole soul bent to the one act of listening, that he
was startled by the deadly warning of a rattlesnake! He comprehended
the truth in an instant. <em>There was one of these reptiles in
the log beyond him!</em></p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine a more fearful situation than the
hunter’s at this moment. He was literally environed by death;
for it was at his head, his feet, and above him, and there was
no escape below. He had just learned that his death was one of
the objects of the Indians, so that to back out into their clutches
would be nothing less than committing suicide. To remain where
he was, would be to disregard the second and last warning of the
coiled rattlesnake. What was to be done? Manifestly nothing but
to die like a man. Haldidge decided to risk the bite of the rattlesnake!</p>

<p>Despite himself, the hunter felt that the reptile was exerting
its horrible fascination over him. Its small eyes, gleaming like
tiny, yet fiery stars, seemed to emit a magnetic ray&mdash;thin, pointed
and palpable, that pierced right into his brain. There was a malignant
subtlety&mdash;an irresistible magnetism. Now the small, glittering
point of light seemed to recede, then to approach and expand,
and then to wave and undulate all around him. Sometimes that bright,
lightning-like ray would shiver and tremble, and then straighten
out with metal-like rigidity, and insinuate itself into his very
being like the invisible point of a spear.</p>

<p>There was a desire on the part of Haldidge to shake off this
influence, which wrapped him like a mantle. There was the desire,
we say, and yet there was a languid listlessness&mdash;a repugnance
to making the effort. The feeling was something similar to that
produced by a powerful opiate, when we are first recovering from
it. There was that dim consciousness&mdash;that indistinct knowledge
of the outer world&mdash;that certainty, that we can break the bond
that holds us, by one vigorous effort, and yet the same sluggish
indifference that prevents the attempt.</p>

<p>Haldidge drew his breath faintly and slowly, yielding more and
more to that fatal subtle influence. He knew he was charmed, and
yet he couldn’t help it. It was now impossible to shake off that
weight which pressed him down like an incubus. That outer world&mdash;so
to speak&mdash;had now receded, and he was in another, from which he
could not return without help beside his own. He seemed to be
moving, flitting, sinking, and rising, through the thin air, borne
upward and downward, hither and thither, on a wing of fire. The
spell was complete. That extraordinary power which instinct holds
over reason&mdash;that wonderful superiority which a reptile sometimes
shows he can exert over man, the snake now held over the hunter.</p>

<p>At this point, from some cause or other, one of the savages struck
the log a violent blow with his hatchet. Haldidge heard it. He
drew a long breath, closed his eyes, and when he reopened them,
looked down at his hands upon which his chin had been resting.</p>

<p>The charm was broken! the hunter had shaken off the fatal spell!</p>

<p>Like the knocking at the gate in Macbeth, which dispels the dark,
awful world of gloom in which the murderers have been moving and
living, and ushers in our own world, with all its hurrying tide
of human life and passions; so this blow of the Indian’s tomahawk
broke the subtle, magnetic spell of the serpent, and lifted the
heavy mantle-like influence which wrapped Haldidge in its folds.</p>

<p>He looked downward, and determined not to raise his eyes again,
for he knew the same power would again rise above him. The serpent,
seemingly conscious of its loss of influence, rattled once more,
and prepared to strike. Haldidge stirred not a muscle; in fact,
he had scarcely moved since entering the log. But the snake did
not strike. The continued, death-like stillness of the hunter,
evidently seemed to the reptile to be death itself. He coiled
and uncoiled himself several times, and then lifting his head,
crawled directly over his neck and body, and passed out of the
log! Here he was killed by the Indians.</p>

<p>Now that the hunter was himself again, he prepared for further
action. The Indians had arisen from the log and were at some distance.
He could hear the mumbling of their voices, but could not distinguish
their words. After awhile these ceased, and he heard no more.</p>

<p>Haldidge was now filled with apprehension for the others. He
had enough faith in the power and cunning of Seth to feel pretty
confident that he would neither lead any one into ambush or fall
into one himself, let it be prepared as skillfully as it might
be; but then he could know nothing of the Indians in the rear,
who might surprise Haverland and Graham at any moment.</p>

<p>The hunter at length grew so restless and uneasy that he emerged
from his hiding-place as rapidly and silently as possible. He
looked cautiously around, but no savage was in sight. Filled with
the most painful apprehensions, he hastened through the wood,
avoiding the trail of his friends, however, and finally came in
sight of them. Before making himself known he concluded to reconnoiter
the place. While doing so, he saw the head of an Indian rise slowly
above a bush, and peer over at the unconscious whites. Without
losing a moment, he raised his rifle, took a quick but sure aim,
and fired. Then calling out to Haverland and Graham, he sprang
for an instant into view.</p>

<p>"Make for cover!" he shouted; "the Indians are upon us!"</p>

<p>In an instant, every one of the whites was invisible.</p>
