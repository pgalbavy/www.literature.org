<p>"I rather think," said Jacob, taking his pipe from his mouth,
"it's in Virgil," and pushing back his chair, he went to the window.</p>

<p>The rashest drivers in the world are, certainly, the drivers
of post-office vans. Swinging down Lamb's Conduit Street, the
scarlet van rounded the corner by the pillar box in such a way
as to graze the kerb and make the little girl who was standing
on tiptoe to post a letter look up, half frightened, half curious.
She paused with her hand in the mouth of the box; then dropped
her letter and ran away. It is seldom only that we see a child
on tiptoe with pity&mdash;more often a dim discomfort, a grain of sand
in the shoe which it's scarcely worth while to remove&mdash;that's
our feeling, and so &mdash;Jacob turned to the bookcase.</p>

<p>Long ago great people lived here, and coming back from Court
past midnight stood, huddling their satin skirts, under the carved
door-posts while the footman roused himself from his mattress
on the floor, hurriedly fastened the lower buttons of his waistcoat,
and let them in. The bitter eighteenth-century rain rushed down
the kennel. Southampton Row, however, is chiefly remarkable nowadays
for the fact that you will always find a man there trying to sell
a tortoise to a tailor. "Showing off the tweed, sir; what the
gentry wants is something singular to catch the eye, sir&mdash;and
clean in their habits, sir!" So they display their tortoises.</p>

<p>At Mudie's corner in Oxford Street all the red and blue beads
had run together on the string. The motor omnibuses were locked.
Mr. Spalding going to the city looked at Mr. Charles Budgeon bound
for Shepherd's Bush. The proximity of the omnibuses gave the outside
passengers an opportunity to stare into each other's faces. Yet
few took advantage of it. Each had his own business to think of.
Each had his past shut in him like the leaves of a book known
to him by heart; and his friends could only read the title, James
Spalding, or Charles Budgeon, and the passengers going the opposite
way could read nothing at all&mdash;save "a man with a red moustache,"
"a young man in grey smoking a pipe." The October sunlight rested
upon all these men and women sitting immobile; and little Johnnie
Sturgeon took the chance to swing down the staircase, carrying
his large mysterious parcel, and so dodging a zigzag course between
the wheels he reached the pavement, started to whistle a tune
and was soon out of sight&mdash;for ever. The omnibuses jerked on,
and every single person felt relief at being a little nearer to
his journey's end, though some cajoled themselves past the immediate
engagement by promise of indulgence beyond&mdash;steak and kidney pudding,
drink or a game of dominoes in the smoky corner of a city restaurant.
Oh yes, human life is very tolerable on the top of an omnibus
in Holborn, when the policeman holds up his arm and the sun beats
on your back, and if there is such a thing as a shell secreted
by man to fit man himself here we find it, on the banks of the
Thames, where the great streets join and St. Paul's Cathedral,
like the volute on the top of the snail shell, finishes it off.
Jacob, getting off his omnibus, loitered up the steps, consulted
his watch, and finally made up his mind to go in.... Does it need
an effort? Yes. These changes of mood wear us out.</p>

<p>Dim it is, haunted by ghosts of white marble, to whom the organ
for ever chaunts. If a boot creaks, it's awful; then the order;
the discipline. The verger with his rod has life ironed out beneath
him. Sweet and holy are the angelic choristers. And for ever round
the marble shoulders, in and out of the folded fingers, go the
thin high sounds of voice and organ. For ever requiem&mdash;repose.
Tired with scrubbing the steps of the Prudential Society's office,
which she did year in year out, Mrs. Lidgett took her seat beneath
the great Duke's tomb, folded her hands, and half closed her eyes.
A magnificent place for an old woman to rest in, by the very side
of the great Duke's bones, whose victories mean nothing to her,
whose name she knows not, though she never fails to greet the
little angels opposite, as she passes out, wishing the like on
her own tomb, for the leathern curtain of the heart has flapped
wide, and out steal on tiptoe thoughts of rest, sweet melodies....
Old Spicer, jute merchant, thought nothing of the kind though.
Strangely enough he'd never been in St. Paul's these fifty years,
though his office windows looked on the churchyard. "So that's
all? Well, a gloomy old place.... Where's Nelson's tomb? No time
now&mdash;come again&mdash;a coin to leave in the box.... Rain or fine is
it? Well, if it would only make up its mind!" Idly the children
stray in&mdash;the verger dissuades them&mdash;and another and another ...
man, woman, man, woman, boy ... casting their eyes up, pursing
their lips, the same shadow brushing the same faces; the leathern
curtain of the heart flaps wide.</p>

<p>Nothing could appear more certain from the steps of St. Paul's
than that each person is miraculously provided with coat, skirt,
and boots; an income; an object. Only Jacob, carrying in his hand
Finlay's Byzantine Empire, which he had bought in Ludgate Hill,
looked a little different; for in his hand he carried a book,
which book he would at nine-thirty precisely, by his own fireside,
open and study, as no one else of all these multitudes would do.
They have no houses. The streets belong to them; the shops; the
churches; theirs the innumerable desks; the stretched office lights;
the vans are theirs, and the railway slung high above the street.
If you look closer you will see that three elderly men at a little
distance from each other run spiders along the pavement as if
the street were their parlour, and here, against the wall, a woman
stares at nothing, boot-laces extended, which she does not ask
you to buy. The posters are theirs too; and the news on them.
A town destroyed; a race won. A homeless people, circling beneath
the sky whose blue or white is held off by a ceiling cloth of
steel filings and horse dung shredded to dust.</p>

<p>There, under the green shade, with his head bent over white paper,
Mr. Sibley transferred figures to folios, and upon each desk you
observe, like provender, a bunch of papers, the day's nutriment,
slowly consumed by the industrious pen. Innumerable overcoats
of the quality prescribed hung empty all day in the corridors,
but as the clock struck six each was exactly filled, and the little
figures, split apart into trousers or moulded into a single thickness,
jerked rapidly with angular forward motion along the pavement;
then dropped into darkness. Beneath the pavement, sunk in the
earth, hollow drains lined with yellow light for ever conveyed
them this way and that, and large letters upon enamel plates represented
in the underworld the parks, squares, and circuses of the upper.
"Marble Arch &mdash;Shepherd's Bush"&mdash;to the majority the Arch
and the Bush are eternally white letters upon a blue ground. Only
at one point&mdash;it may be Acton, Holloway, Kensal Rise, Caledonian
Road&mdash;does the name mean shops where you buy things, and houses,
in one of which, down to the right, where the pollard trees grow
out of the paving stones, there is a square curtained window,
and a bedroom.</p>

<p>Long past sunset an old blind woman sat on a camp-stool with
her back to the stone wall of the Union of London and Smith's
Bank, clasping a brown mongrel tight in her arms and singing out
loud, not for coppers, no, from the depths of her gay wild heart&mdash;her
sinful, tanned heart&mdash;for the child who fetches her is the fruit
of sin, and should have been in bed, curtained, asleep, instead
of hearing in the lamplight her mother's wild song, where she
sits against the Bank, singing not for coppers, with her dog against
her breast.</p>

<p>Home they went. The grey church spires received them; the hoary
city, old, sinful, and majestic. One behind another, round or
pointed, piercing the sky or massing themselves, like sailing
ships, like granite cliffs, spires and offices, wharves and factories
crowd the bank; eternally the pilgrims trudge; barges rest in
mid stream heavy laden; as some believe, the city loves her prostitutes.</p>

<p>But few, it seems, are admitted to that degree. Of all the carriages
that leave the arch of the Opera House, not one turns eastward,
and when the little thief is caught in the empty market-place
no one in black-and-white or rose-coloured evening dress blocks
the way by pausing with a hand upon the carriage door to help
or condemn&mdash;though Lady Charles, to do her justice, sighs sadly
as she ascends her staircase, takes down Thomas a Kempis, and
does not sleep till her mind has lost itself tunnelling into the
complexity of things. "Why? Why? Why?" she sighs. On the whole
it's best to walk back from the Opera House. Fatigue is the safest
sleeping draught.</p>

<p>The autumn season was in full swing. Tristan was twitching his
rug up under his armpits twice a week; Isolde waved her scarf
in miraculous sympathy with the conductor's baton. In all parts
of the house were to be found pink faces and glittering breasts.
When a Royal hand attached to an invisible body slipped out and
withdrew the red and white bouquet reposing on the scarlet ledge,
the Queen of England seemed a name worth dying for. Beauty, in
its hothouse variety (which is none of the worst), flowered in
box after box; and though nothing was said of profound importance,
and though it is generally agreed that wit deserted beautiful
lips about the time that Walpole died&mdash;at any rate when Victoria
in her nightgown descended to meet her ministers, the lips (through
an opera glass) remained red, adorable. Bald distinguished men
with gold-headed canes strolled down the crimson avenues between
the stalls, and only broke from intercourse with the boxes when
the lights went down, and the conductor, first bowing to the Queen,
next to the bald-headed men, swept round on his feet and raised
his wand.</p>

<p>Then two thousand hearts in the semi-darkness remembered, anticipated,
travelled dark labyrinths; and Clara Durrant said farewell to
Jacob Flanders, and tasted the sweetness of death in effigy; and
Mrs. Durrant, sitting behind her in the dark of the box, sighed
her sharp sigh; and Mr. Wortley, shifting his position behind
the Italian Ambassador's wife, thought that Brangaena was a trifle
hoarse; and suspended in the gallery many feet above their heads,
Edward Whittaker surreptitiously held a torch to his miniature
score; and ... and ...</p>

<p>In short, the observer is choked with observations. Only to prevent
us from being submerged by chaos, nature and society between them
have arranged a system of classification which is simplicity itself;
stalls, boxes, amphitheatre, gallery. The moulds are filled nightly.
There is no need to distinguish details. But the difficulty remains&mdash;one
has to choose. For though I have no wish to be Queen of England
or only for a moment &mdash;I would willingly sit beside her;
I would hear the Prime Minister's gossip; the countess whisper,
and share her memories of halls and gardens; the massive fronts
of the respectable conceal after all their secret code; or why
so impermeable? And then, doffing one's own headpiece, how strange
to assume for a moment some one's&mdash;any one's&mdash;to be a man of valour
who has ruled the Empire; to refer while Brangaena sings to the
fragments of Sophocles, or see in a flash, as the shepherd pipes
his tune, bridges and aqueducts. But no&mdash;we must choose. Never
was there a harsher necessity! or one which entails greater pain,
more certain disaster; for wherever I seat myself, I die in exile:
Whittaker in his lodging-house; Lady Charles at the Manor.</p>

<p>A young man with a Wellington nose, who had occupied a seven-and-sixpenny
seat, made his way down the stone stairs when the opera ended,
as if he were still set a little apart from his fellows by the
influence of the music.</p>

<p>At midnight Jacob Flanders heard a rap on his door.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed. "You're the very man I want!" and without
more ado they discovered the lines which he had been seeking all
day; only they come not in Virgil, but in Lucretius.</p>

<p>"Yes; that should make him sit up," said Bonamy, as Jacob stopped
reading. Jacob was excited. It was the first time he had read
his essay aloud.</p>

<p>"Damned swine!" he said, rather too extravagantly; but the praise
had gone to his head. Professor Bulteel, of Leeds, had issued
an edition of Wycherley without stating that he had left out,
disembowelled, or indicated only by asterisks, several indecent
words and some indecent phrases. An outrage, Jacob said; a breach
of faith; sheer prudery; token of a lewd mind and a disgusting
nature. Aristophanes and Shakespeare were cited. Modern life was
repudiated. Great play was made with the professional title, and
Leeds as a seat of learning was laughed to scorn. And the extraordinary
thing was that these young men were perfectly right&mdash;extraordinary,
because, even as Jacob copied his pages, he knew that no one would
ever print them; and sure enough back they came from the Fortnightly,
the Contemporary, the Nineteenth Century&mdash;when Jacob threw them
into the black wooden box where he kept his mother's letters,
his old flannel trousers, and a note or two with the Cornish postmark.
The lid shut upon the truth.</p>

<p>This black wooden box, upon which his name was still legible
in white paint, stood between the long windows of the sitting-room.
The street ran beneath. No doubt the bedroom was behind. The furniture&mdash;three
wicker chairs and a gate-legged table&mdash;came from Cambridge. These
houses (Mrs. Garfit's daughter, Mrs. Whitehorn, was the landlady
of this one) were built, say, a hundred and fifty years ago. The
rooms are shapely, the ceilings high; over the doorway a rose,
or a ram's skull, is carved in the wood. The eighteenth century
has its distinction. Even the panels, painted in raspberry-coloured
paint, have their distinction....</p>

<p>"Distinction" &mdash;Mrs. Durrant said that Jacob Flanders was
"distinguished-looking." "Extremely awkward," she said, "but so
distinguished-looking." Seeing him for the first time that no
doubt is the word for him. Lying back in his chair, taking his
pipe from his lips, and saying to Bonamy: "About this opera now"
(for they had done with indecency). "This fellow Wagner" ... distinction
was one of the words to use naturally, though, from looking at
him, one would have found it difficult to say which seat in the
opera house was his, stalls, gallery, or dress circle. A writer?
He lacked self-consciousness. A painter? There was something in
the shape of his hands (he was descended on his mother's side
from a family of the greatest antiquity and deepest obscurity)
which indicated taste. Then his mouth&mdash;but surely, of all futile
occupations this of cataloguing features is the worst. One word
is sufficient. But if one cannot find it?</p>

<p>"I like Jacob Flanders," wrote Clara Durrant in her diary. "He
is so unworldly. He gives himself no airs, and one can say what
one likes to him, though he's frightening because ..." But Mr.
Letts allows little space in his shilling diaries. Clara was not
the one to encroach upon Wednesday. Humblest, most candid of women!
"No, no, no," she sighed, standing at the greenhouse door, "don't
break&mdash;don't spoil"&mdash;what? Something infinitely wonderful.</p>

<p>But then, this is only a young woman's language, one, too, who
loves, or refrains from loving. She wished the moment to continue
for ever precisely as it was that July morning. And moments don't.
Now, for instance, Jacob was telling a story about some walking
tour he'd taken, and the inn was called "The Foaming Pot," which,
considering the landlady's name ... They shouted with laughter.
The joke was indecent.</p>

<p>Then Julia Eliot said "the silent young man," and as she dined
with Prime Ministers, no doubt she meant: "If he is going to get
on in the world, he will have to find his tongue."</p>

<p>Timothy Durrant never made any comment at all.</p>

<p>The housemaid found herself very liberally rewarded.</p>

<p>Mr. Sopwith's opinion was as sentimental as Clara's, though far
more skilfully expressed.</p>

<p>Betty Flanders was romantic about Archer and tender about John;
she was unreasonably irritated by Jacob's clumsiness in the house.</p>

<p>Captain Barfoot liked him best of the boys; but as for saying
why ...</p>

<p>It seems then that men and women are equally at fault. It seems
that a profound, impartial, and absolutely just opinion of our
fellow-creatures is utterly unknown. Either we are men, or we
are women. Either we are cold, or we are sentimental. Either we
are young, or growing old. In any case life is but a procession
of shadows, and God knows why it is that we embrace them so eagerly,
and see them depart with such anguish, being shadows. And why,
if this&mdash;and much more than this is true, why are we yet surprised
in the window corner by a sudden vision that the young man in
the chair is of all things in the world the most real, the most
solid, the best known to us&mdash;why indeed? For the moment after
we know nothing about him.</p>

<p>Such is the manner of our seeing. Such the conditions of our
love.</p>

<p>("I'm twenty-two. It's nearly the end of October. Life is thoroughly
pleasant, although unfortunately there are a great number of fools
about. One must apply oneself to something or other &mdash;God
knows what. Everything is really very jolly&mdash;except getting up
in the morning and wearing a tail coat.")</p>

<p>"I say, Bonamy, what about Beethoven?"</p>

<p>("Bonamy is an amazing fellow. He knows practically everything&mdash;not
more about English literature than I do&mdash;but then he's read all
those Frenchmen.")</p>

<p>"I rather suspect you're talking rot, Bonamy. In spite of what
you say, poor old Tennyson...."</p>

<p>("The truth is one ought to have been taught French. Now, I suppose,
old Barfoot is talking to my mother. That's an odd affair to be
sure. But I can't see Bonamy down there. Damn London!") for the
market carts were lumbering down the street.</p>

<p>"What about a walk on Saturday?"</p>

<p>("What's happening on Saturday?")</p>

<p>Then, taking out his pocket-book, he assured himself that the
night of the Durrants' party came next week.</p>

<p>But though all this may very well be true&mdash;so Jacob thought and
spoke&mdash;so he crossed his legs&mdash;filled his pipe&mdash;sipped his whisky,
and once looked at his pocket-book, rumpling his hair as he did
so, there remains over something which can never be conveyed to
a second person save by Jacob himself. Moreover, part of this
is not Jacob but Richard Bonamy&mdash;the room; the market carts; the
hour; the very moment of history. Then consider the effect of
sex&mdash;how between man and woman it hangs wavy, tremulous, so that
here's a valley, there's a peak, when in truth, perhaps, all's
as flat as my hand. Even the exact words get the wrong accent
on them. But something is always impelling one to hum vibrating,
like the hawk moth, at the mouth of the cavern of mystery, endowing
Jacob Flanders with all sorts of qualities he had not at all&mdash;for
though, certainly, he sat talking to Bonamy, half of what he said
was too dull to repeat; much unintelligible (about unknown people
and Parliament); what remains is mostly a matter of guess work.
Yet over him we hang vibrating.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Captain Barfoot, knocking out his pipe on Betty Flanders's
hob, and buttoning his coat. "It doubles the work, but I don't
mind that."</p>

<p>He was now town councillor. They looked at the night, which was
the same as the London night, only a good deal more transparent.
Church bells down in the town were striking eleven o'clock. The
wind was off the sea. And all the bedroom windows were dark&mdash;the
Pages were asleep; the Garfits were asleep; the Cranches were
asleep&mdash;whereas in London at this hour they were burning Guy Fawkes
on Parliament Hill.</p>
