<p>The cat that fell from the top of the Washington monument, and
scampered off unhurt was killed by a dog at the next corner. Thus
a certain painter-man, winged with canvases and easel, might have
been seen to depart hurriedly from a poppy-sprinkled field, an
infuriated Norman stallion in close attendance, and to fly safely
over a stone wall of good height, only to turn his ankle upon
an unconsidered pebble, some ten paces farther on; the nose of
the stallion projected over the wall, snorting joy thereat. The
ankle was one which had turned aforetime; it was an old weakness:
moreover, it was mine. I was the painter-man.</p>

<p>I could count on little less than a week of idleness within the
confines of Les Trois Pigeons; and reclining among cushions in
a wicker long-chair looking out from my pavilion upon the drowsy
garden on a hot noontide, I did not much care. It was cooler indoors,
comfortable enough; the open door framed the courtyard where pigeons
were strutting on the gravel walks between flower-beds. Beyond,
and thrown deeper into the perspective by the outer frame of the
great archway, road and fields and forest fringes were revealed,
lying tremulously in the hot sunshine. The foreground gained a
human (though not lively) interest from the ample figure of our
maitre d'hotel reposing in a rustic chair which had enjoyed the
shade of an arbour about an hour earlier, when first occupied,
but now stood in the broiling sun. At times Amedee's upper eyelids
lifted as much as the sixteenth of an inch, and he made a hazy
gesture as if to wave the sun away, or, when the table-cloth upon
his left arm slid slowly earthward, he adjusted it with a petulant
jerk, without material interruption to his siesta. Meanwhile Glouglou,
rolling and smoking cigarettes in the shade of a clump of lilac,
watched with button eyes the noddings of his superior, and, at
the cost of some convulsive writhings, constrained himself to
silent laughter.</p>

<p>A heavy step crunched the gravel and I heard my name pronounced
in a deep inquiring rumble&mdash;the voice of Professor Keredec, no
less. Nor was I greatly surprised, since our meeting in the forest
had led me to expect some advances on his part toward friendliness,
or, at least, in the direction of a better acquaintance. However,
I withheld my reply for a moment to make sure I had heard aright.</p>

<p>The name was repeated.</p>

<p>"Here I am," I called, "in the pavilion, if you wish to see me."</p>

<p>"Aha! I hear you become an invalid, my dear sir." With that the
professor's great bulk loomed in the doorway against the glare
outside. "I have come to condole with you, if you allow it."</p>

<p>"To smoke with me, too, I hope," I said, not a little pleased.</p>

<p>"That I will do," he returned, and came in slowly, walking with
perceptible lameness. "The sympathy I offer is genuine: it is
not only from the heart, it is from the latissimus dorsi" he continued,
seating himself with a cavernous groan. "I am your confrere in
illness, my dear sir. I have choosed this fine weather for rheumatism
of the back."</p>

<p>"I hope it is not painful."</p>

<p>"Ha, it is so-so," he rumbled, removing his spectacles and wiping
his eyes, dazzled by the sun. "There is more of me than of most
men&mdash;more to suffer. Nature was generous to the little germs when
she made this big Keredec; she offered them room for their campaigns
of war."</p>

<p>"You'll take a cigarette?"</p>

<p>"I thank you; if you do not mind, I smoke my pipe."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a worn leather case, which he opened,
disclosing a small, browned clay bowl of the kind workmen use;
and, fitting it with a red stem, he filled it with a dark and
sinister tobacco from a pouch. "Always my pipe for me," he said,
and applied a match, inhaling the smoke as other men inhale the
light smoke of cigarettes. "Ha, it is good! It is wicked for the
insides, but it is good for the soul." And clouds wreathed his
great beard like a storm on Mont Blanc as he concluded, with gusto,
"It is my first pipe since yesterday."</p>

<p>"That is being a good smoker," I ventured sententiously; "to
whet indulgence with abstinence."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," he protested, "I am a man without even enough
virtue to be an epicure. When I am alone I am a chimney with no
hebdomadary repose; I smoke forever. It is on account of my young
friend I am temperate now."</p>

<p>"He has never smoked, your young friend?" I asked, glancing at
my visitor rather curiously, I fear.</p>

<p>"Mr. Saffren has no vices." Professor Keredec replaced his silver-rimmed
spectacles and turned them upon me with serene benevolence. "He
is in good condition, all pure, like little children&mdash;and so if
I smoke near him he chokes and has water at the eyes, though he
does not complain. Just now I take a vacation: it is his hour
for study, but I think he looks more out of the front window than
at his book. He looks very much from the window"&mdash;there was a
muttering of subterranean thunder somewhere, which I was able
to locate in the professor's torso, and took to be his expression
of a chuckle&mdash;"yes, very much, since the passing of that charming
lady some days ago."</p>

<p>"You say your young friend's name is Saffren?"</p>

<p>"Oliver Saffren." The benevolent gaze continued to rest upon
me, but a shadow like a faint anxiety darkened the Homeric brow,
and an odd notion entered my mind (without any good reason) that
Professor Keredec was wondering what I thought of the name. I
uttered some commonplace syllable of no moment, and there ensued
a pause during which the seeming shadow upon my visitor's forehead
became a reality, deepening to a look of perplexity and trouble.
Finally he said abruptly: "It is about him that I have come to
talk to you."</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad," I murmured, but he brushed the callow
formality aside with a gesture of remonstrance.</p>

<p>"Ha, my dear sir," he cried; "but you are a man of feeling! We
are both old enough to deal with more than just these little words
of the mouth! It was the way you have received my poor young gentleman's
excuses when he was so rude, which make me wish to talk with you
on such a subject; it is why I would not have you believe Mr.
Saffren and me two very suspected individuals who hide here like
two bad criminals!"</p>

<p>"No, no," I protested hastily. "The name of Professor Keredec&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The name of NO man," he thundered, interrupting, "can protect
his reputation when he is caught peeping from a curtain! Ha, my
dear sir! I know what you think. You think, 'He is a nice fine
man, that old professor, oh, very nice&mdash;only he hides behind the
curtains sometimes! Very fine man, oh, yes; only he is a spy.'
Eh? Ha, ha! That is what you have been thinking, my dear sir!"</p>

<p>"Not at all," I laughed; "I thought you might fear that <em>I</em>
was a spy."</p>

<p>"Eh?" He became sharply serious upon the instant. "What made
you think that?"</p>

<p>"I supposed you might be conducting some experiments, or perhaps
writing a book which you wished to keep from the public for a
time, and that possibly you might imagine that I was a reporter."</p>

<p>"So! And <em>THAT </em>is all," he returned, with evident relief.
"No, my dear sir, I was the spy; it is the truth; and I was spying
upon you. I confess my shame. I wish very much to know what you
were like, what kind of a man you are. And so," he concluded with
an opening of the hands, palms upward, as if to show that nothing
remained for concealment, "and so I have watched you."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The explanation is so simple: it was necessary."</p>

<p>"Because of&mdash;of Mr. Saffren?" I said slowly, and with some trepidation.</p>

<p>"Precisely." The professor exhaled a cloud of smoke. "Because
I am sensitive for him, and because in a certain way I am&mdash;how
should it be said?&mdash;perhaps it is near the truth to say, I am
his guardian."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he rejoined quickly, "but I am afraid you do not
see. I am not his guardian by the law."</p>

<p>"I had not supposed that you were," I said.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because, though he puzzled me and I do not understand his case&mdash;his
case, so to speak, I have not for a moment thought him insane."</p>

<p>"Ha, my dear sir, you are right!" exclaimed Keredec, beaming
on me, much pleased. "You are a thousand times right; he is as
sane as yourself or myself or as anybody in the whole wide world!
Ha! he is now much <em>MORE </em>sane, for his mind is not yet
confused and becobwebbed with the useless things you and I put
into ours. It is open and clear like the little children's mind.
And it is a good mind! It is only a little learning, a little
experience, that he lacks. A few months more&mdash;ha, at the greatest,
a year from now&mdash;and he will not be different any longer; he will
be like the rest of us. Only"&mdash;the professor leaned forward and
his big fist came down on the arm of his chair&mdash;"he shall be better
than the rest of us! But if strange people were to see him now,"
he continued, leaning back and dropping his voice to a more confidential
tone, "it would not do. This poor world is full of fools; there
are so many who judge quickly. If they should see him now, they
might think he is not just right in his brain; and then, as it
could happen so easily, those same people might meet him again
after a while. 'Ha,' they would say, 'there was a time when that
young man was insane. I knew him!' And so he might go through
his life with those clouds over him. Those clouds are black clouds,
they can make more harm than our old sins, and I wish to save
my friend from them. So I have brought him here to this quiet
place where nobody comes, and we can keep from meeting any foolish
people. But, my dear sir"&mdash;he leaned forward again, and spoke
emphatically&mdash;"it would be barbarous for men of intelligence to
live in the same house and go always hiding from one another!
Let us dine together this evening, if you will, and not only this
evening but every evening you are willing to share with us and
do not wish to be alone. It will be good for us. We are three
men like hermits, far out of the world, but&mdash;a thousand saints!&mdash;let
us be civilised to one another!"</p>

<p>"With all my heart," I said.</p>

<p>"Ha! I wish you to know my young man," Keredec went on. "You
will like him&mdash;no man of feeling could keep himself from liking
him&mdash;and he is your fellow-countryman. I hope you will be his
friend. He should make friends, for he needs them."</p>

<p>"I think he has a host of them," said I, "in Professor Keredec."</p>

<p>My visitor looked at me quizzically for a moment, shook his head
and sighed. "That is only one small man in a big body, that Professor
Keredec. And yet," he went on sadly, "it is all the friends that
poor boy has in this world. You will dine with us to-night?"</p>

<p>Acquiescing cheerfully, I added: "You will join me at the table
on my veranda, won't you? I can hobble that far but not much farther."</p>

<p>Before answering he cast a sidelong glance at the arrangement
of things outside the door. The screen of honeysuckle ran partly
across the front of the little porch, about half of which it concealed
from the garden and consequently from the road beyond the archway.
I saw that he took note of this before he pointed to that corner
of the veranda most closely screened by the vines and said:</p>

<p>"May the table be placed yonder?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; I often have it there, even when I am alone."</p>

<p>"Ha, that is good," he exclaimed. "It is not human for a Frenchman
to eat in the house in good weather."</p>

<p>"It is a pity," I said, "that I should have been such a bugbear."</p>

<p>This remark was thoroughly disingenuous, for, although I did
not doubt that anything he told me was perfectly true, nor that
he had made as complete a revelation as he thought consistent
with his duty toward the young man in his charge, I did not believe
that his former precautions were altogether due to my presence
at the inn.</p>

<p>And I was certain that while he might fear for his friend some
chance repute of insanity, he had greater terrors than that. As
to their nature I had no clew; nor was it my affair to be guessing;
but whatever they were, the days of security at Les Trois Pigeons
had somewhat eased Professor Keredec's mind in regard to them.
At least, his anxiety was sufficiently assuaged to risk dining
out of doors with only my screen of honeysuckle between his charge
and curious eyes. So much was evident.</p>

<p>"The reproach is deserved," he returned, after a pause. "It is
to be wished that all our bugbears might offer as pleasant a revelation,
if we had the courage, or the slyness"&mdash;he laughed&mdash;"to investigate."</p>

<p>I made a reply of similar gallantry and he got to his feet, rubbing
his back as he rose.</p>

<p>"Ha, I am old! old! Rheumatism in warm weather: that is ugly.
Now I must go to my boy and see what he can make of his Gibbon.
The poor fellow! I think he finds the decay of Rome worse than
rheumatism in summer!"</p>

<p>He replaced his pipe in its case, and promising heartily that
it should not be the last he would smoke in my company and domain,
was making slowly for the door when he paused at a sound from
the road.</p>

<p>We heard the rapid hoof-beats of a mettled horse. He crossed
our vision and the open archway: a high-stepping hackney going
well, driven by a lady in a light trap which was half full of
wild flowers. It was a quick picture, like a flash of the cinematograph,
but the pose of the lady as a driver was seen to be of a commanding
grace, and though she was not in white but in light blue, and
her plain sailor hat was certainly not trimmed with roses, I had
not the least difficulty in recognising her. At the same instant
there was a hurried clatter of foot-steps upon the stairway leading
from the gallery; the startled pigeons fluttered up from the garden-path,
betaking themselves to flight, and "that other monsieur" came
leaping across the courtyard, through the archway and into the
road.</p>

<p>"Glouglou! Look quickly!" he called loudly, in French, as he
came; "Who is that lady?"</p>

<p>Glouglou would have replied, but the words were taken out of
his mouth. Amedee awoke with a frantic start and launched himself
at the archway, carroming from its nearest corner and hurtling
onward at a speed which for once did not diminish in proportion
to his progress.</p>

<p>"That lady, monsieur?" he gasped, checking himself at the young
man's side and gazing after the trap, "that is Madame d'Armand."</p>

<p>"Madame d'Armand," Saffren repeated the name slowly. "Her name
is Madame d'Armand."</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur," said Amedee complacently; "it is an American
lady who has married a French nobleman."</p>
