<p><em>MARTHA </em>had said that Dan’s remaining away "didn’t hurt—not
exactly"; and by this she meant to give Harlan the impression
that she was less than hurt; but such a denial, thus qualified,
means in truth more than hurt. She was a "big Western woman,"
but she could be sensitive, and had her resentments and her smallnesses.
Perhaps she was not quite genuinely sorry to believe that the
old friend who neglected to bid her welcome home had begun to
look almost middle-aged and seemed to have lost something fine
that he had possessed in his youth. There were characteristic
possessions of his that he had not lost, however; he had even
acquired more of them, as she discovered one evening a few weeks
after the Sunday noon when little Henry tore her dress.</p>

<p>Mr. Shelby had come home from his office in a state of irritability,
which he made audible even before he entered the house; and from
her windows upstairs she heard him denouncing his old negro driver.
There had been a thunderstorm earlier in the afternoon, but that
was no excuse—"not a dog-gone <em>bit</em> of excuse!" Mr. Shelby
declared—for a carriage to be "all so sploshed-over with mud that
a decent man’d be ashamed to get caught dead in it!" And he seemed
to resent the fat old servitor’s wheezy explanation that the mud
was the work of a malevolent motor-car. "Cain’t go nowhur them
automob’les ain’ goin’ to git you these days! I had my carri’ge
all spick-an’-span. Automob’le come zimmin’ by jes’ as we turn
onto the avenoo. ‘Splickety-splick-splash!’ she say, an’ <em>zoosh!</em>
jes’ look at my nice clean carri’ge solid mud! No, suh, Mist’
Shelby; I had my carri’ge all wash up fresh. Nasty ole automob’le
spoil ev’ything! No, suh, I——"</p>

<p>"Gee-mun-nent-ly!" Martha heard her father exclaim. "What you
tryin’ to do? <em>Talk</em> me to death? I already heard enough
talk in my office for one day, thank you! By Cripey, you stop
that eternal gab o’ yours and get those horses into the barn and
sponge their mouths out! Hear me?"</p>

<p>He came into the house and could be heard muttering snappishly
to himself on the stairway, as he ascended to his room to "wash
his face and hands for dinner." But at the table he proved that
soap and water were ineffective, at least to remove bitterness
from a face; and he found fault with everything. The most unbearable
of his troubles finally appeared to be put upon him by the salt,
which the humidity of the weather had affected. "I s’pose this
is the way you keep house in Italy!" he said. "Nothin’ but smell
and deggeredation over there anyway—they prob’ly don’t care whether
they can get salt out o’ their saltcellars or not. But in this
country, in a decent man’s house, he’d like to see at least one
saltcellar on his table that’d <em>work</em>!"</p>

<p>"It’s apt to be like that in hot weather after a rain," Martha
returned placidly. "What went wrong at the office this afternoon,
papa?"</p>

<p>"Nothin’!" he said fiercely. "What’s my office got to do with
wet salt? Why can’t you ever learn to keep some connection between
your thoughts? Geemunently!"</p>

<p>"So you had a good day, did you, papa?"</p>

<p>"It would ’a’ been," he replied angrily, "if it hadn’t been for
a fool friend o’ yours!"</p>

<p>"Somebody I’m responsible for?" she inquired with a genial sarcasm
that exasperated him into attempted mockery—for when he was angriest
with her he would repeat something she said, and, to point the
burlesque, would speak in a tinny and whining falsetto which he
seemed to believe was a crushing imitation of his daughter’s voice.
"‘Somebody I’m responsible for?’" he squeaked, using this form
of reprisal now. "No; it ain’t somebody you’re responsible for!"
Here he fell back upon downright ferocity. "Doggone him! Somebody
<em>better</em> be responsible for him!"</p>

<p>At this Martha made a good guess. "Dan Oliphant!"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma’am! And I came within just one o’ throwin’ him out o’
my office! Stood up there and grinned at me in front o’ my own
desk and told me what I had to do! What I <em>had</em> to do!"</p>

<p>"And <em>do</em> you have to, papa?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"I only wondered——"</p>

<p>"Why, plague take him, I never saw the beat of it!" he went on,
disregarding her. "Walked right into my office and told me I had
to run my car line all the way across his Addition. Told me I
<em>had</em> to! I told him we <em>were</em> goin’ almost to the
edge of it and that’d be every last speck o’ the way we’d move
until he does the right thing."</p>

<p>"Until he does what ‘right thing,’ papa?"</p>

<p>"Until he quits bein’ a hog!" the old man returned violently.
"He seems to think the best men in this town got nothin’ on earth
to do but spend their time buildin’ up his property for him and
makin’ it more valuable, all for <em>his</em> benefit. I told
him when he was ready to act like a decent man and reorganize
his holdings with a good trust company’s advice, and issue stock,
and let somebody else <em>in</em>, we might talk to him and not
before."</p>

<p>"What did Dan say?"</p>

<p>"Said he tried to get us in at the start, and now we could go
plum <em>to</em>! Said I’d put that car line through there whether
I wanted to or not. Threatened me with a petition of his lot owners,
and said they were liable to go before the legislature and get
my charter annulled, if I didn’t do it."</p>

<p>"Was he angry, papa?"</p>

<p>"Angry? No!" Mr. Shelby vociferated. "What in continental did
<em>he</em> have to be angry about? <em>I</em> was the one that
was angry. He stood up there and laughed and bragged about what
he was goin’ to do till you’d thought he’d bust with the gas of
it! Why, Great Geemunently!—you’d thought this whole city’s got
nothin’ to do but turn in and run around doin’ what Ornaby Addition
says it’s got to! I says, ‘Yes!’ I says. ‘So from now on the tail’s
goin’ to wag the dog, is it?’ ‘I don’t know but it might,’ he
says. ‘This town’s done considerable laughin’ at me,’ he says.
‘I expect it’s about time I did some laughin’ myself,’ he says.
‘You’ll have to look out for your charter, Mr. Shelby,’ he says."</p>

<p>Martha ventured to continue her naïveté, and unfortunately carried
it too far. "And <em>will</em> you have to look out for it, papa?"
she asked gently.</p>

<p>With his thin but hard old fist he struck the table a blow that
jarred the china and jingled the silver. "Haven’t you got any
<em>sense</em>?" he shouted. "I’ll show him who he’s talkin’ to!
There’s a <em>few</em> men left in this town that’ll teach him
a little before he gets through with ’em! I’m not the only one
he thinks he can lay down the law to." He glared at her, his small
gray face flushing with his increased anger. "Are <em>you</em>
still standin’ up for him after the way he’s treated you?"</p>

<p>This took Martha’s breath, and for an instant she was at a loss.
Never before had her father seemed to notice how she was "treated"—by
anybody. "I don’t know what you—I don’t know what you mean," she
said.</p>

<p>"Don’t you?" he returned sharply, and, before the bright stare
of his angry eyes, her own troubled gaze fell. "You say you don’t
know what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Why—no. Not—not at all," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Well, <em>I</em> do!" And with a brief shot of breath between
his almost closed lips, he further expressed an emotion that remained
enigmatic to her. He rose. "Seems to me it’s about time you quit
standin’ up for him," he said; and stalked out of the room, leaving
her still at the table.</p>

<p>She sat there in an attitude of some rigidity after she had heard
him go upstairs, and she continued to sit there, though she had
finished her dinner before he departed. The conclusion she reached
in her thoughts was that there was a question she would never
ask him;—she would never ask him what he had meant by that final
remark of his. She hoped he meant only that her pride ought to
resent a neighbour’s failure to come to say he was glad to see
her at home again—but she feared her father meant more than this.
She feared he meant much more, and she so feared it that she would
never dare to ask him.</p>

<p>Yet she wondered why she wouldn’t dare. How could it ever be
"about time" for her to stop standing up for an old friend? And
when Harlan was announced to her, as she sat alone at the table,
she rose with a little sigh. She did not sigh because she was
sorry he had come; it was because she had just realized how much
more his brother was still the heart of her thoughts than was
this faithful and constant escort.</p>

<p>For she and Harlan had already fallen into a relation not uncommon
among those she had spoken of as "left-overs": a relation that
becomes a habit—a habit that in turn becomes a relation. She "went
everywhere" with him; and continued to go everywhere with him;
and so, after a while, their contemporaries, all married, never
sent an invitation to one without including the other. Then, as
time went on, and the habit continued and continued, it became
common stock in the prattle of more dashing and precipitous younger
people. When talk languished and even weather stencils failed
to cover a blank, those who felt such covering a necessity could
always fall back on this, and wonder why the two didn’t "get married
and be done with it."</p>

<p>In that manner a worn woman-of-the-world, aged twenty, complained
to Frederic Oliphant one evening at the Country Club, as he sat
with her after unsuccessfully attempting an imported dance he
found himself too old to learn. "You aren’t too old to learn it,
if you wouldn’t insist on being too polite to hold a girl as tight
as these boys do," the woman-of-the-world informed him with the
new frankness then becoming fashionable. "You aren’t as old as
your cousin Harlan. Why on earth don’t he and Miss Shelby get
married and be done with it? They’ve certainly been just the same
as engaged for almost as long as I can remember. Everybody says
they <em>must</em> be engaged—by this time! They say she used
to be in love with his brother. I don’t see how anybody could
be in love with <em>him</em>!"</p>

<p>She glanced through an archway, near by, to where Dan and his
wife and Martha and Harlan and a dozen other people were gravely
straggling out of the dining-room; all of this party having the
air of concluding a festival that had not proved too hilarious.
Dan, in particular, appeared to have thought the occasion a solemn
one. He had been placed next to Martha; and she remarked cheerfully
that it was the first time he had been so near her "in ages."
After that, however, she found little more to say to him, since
he seemed to encounter certain definite difficulties in saying
anything to her in return.</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> coming in to—to call, some evening," he stammered,
laughing uncomfortably to express his cordiality. "I’d have been
to see you—I’d have been over oftener, except——" He paused, then
concluded his ill-fated excuses hurriedly—"except I’m so busy
these days." And he glanced uneasily across the table to where
Lena sat smiling mysteriously at him.</p>

<p>Martha thought it tactful, and the part of a true friend, to
talk to Harlan, who sat next to her on the other side. </p>
