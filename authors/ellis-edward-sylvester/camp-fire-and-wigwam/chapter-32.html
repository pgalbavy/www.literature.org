<p>The youth had stopped paddling for a few minutes' rest, when
he observed that he was close upon a broad clearing which came
close to the water's edge. He had scarcely time to notice that
much when he saw several large conical objects, and before he
knew it, he was floating in front of an Indian village, numbering
some twelve or fifteen wigwams. Squaws, children, and even warriors
were lolling about very much as in the Sauk village, from which
he had fled only a short time before.</p>

<p>It fairly took away the breath of Jack. In all his fancies he
had not once thought of anything like this, or he would have avoided
running into what promised to prove a fatal trap.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" he gasped, "this is a little too much of a good
thing; it'll never do at all."</p>

<p>The settlement was on the right hand bank of the stream, which
just there had a northerly course. It was, therefore, on the shore
where the fugitive desired to land. Dipping his improvised paddle,
he drove the boat ahead with all the power he could command, and
drew a breath of partial relief, when another sweeping curve shut
him from sight.</p>

<p>It was apparent that the Indians failed to grasp the situation
in its entirety. They were accustomed to see white men hunting
and trapping in that region, and they may have felt no wish to
molest one of their number, though tempted so to do by his unprotected
situation. At any rate, they stared at the canoe without offering
to disturb its occupant. The black-eyed youngsters gaped wonderingly,
and Jack saw several point in his direction, while they doubtless
indulged in observations concerning him.</p>

<p>But it need not be said that he was frightened almost out of
his wits, and filled with self-disgust that he should have gone
blindly into a peril against which a child ought to have mounted
guard. The moment he felt he was out of sight of the redmen, who
showed far less curiosity than he expected, he sprang ashore and
shoved the canoe back into the current, which speedily carried
it out of sight. Having landed, Jack hastened among the trees
at the fastest gait possible. He was close to the village, although
beyond sight. Glancing over his shoulder he expected every minute
to see some of the dusky warriors, and to hear their whoops as
they broke in pursuit.</p>

<p>It must have been that this particular Indian village felt little
if any interest in the white youth who paddled in front of their
door, for not one of the number made a move by way of pursuit.</p>

<p>When Jack had pushed through the wilderness for a couple of miles
he formed the same conclusion, and dropped to a deliberate walk.
The face of the country was rocky and broken, and he was confident
that in many places he had left no trail at all. But, with that
conviction came two others: he not only was tired but was excessively
hungry. He had caught sight of game more than once while on the
march, as it may be called, but refrained from firing through
fear that the report of his gun would guide others who were hunting
for him. At the same time he had twice heard the discharge of
rifles at widely separated points. Probably they were fired by
Indians on the hunt, or possibly some of the trappers of that
section had not yet started on their long journey to St. Louis.
At any rate when the sun had passed the meridian and the afternoon
was well advanced, he made up his mind that he would take the
first chance to secure food, no matter in what shape it presented
itself.</p>

<p>He smiled to himself, when within the succeeding ten minutes
he caught sight of a young deer among the trees less than one
hundred feet in advance. It bounded off affrighted by the figure
of the youth, who, however, was so nigh that he brought it to
the ground without difficulty.</p>

<p>When he ran forward to dress it, he was surprised to find it
had fallen within a rod of a ravine fifty feet deep.</p>

<p>This ravine, which had evidently been a ca√±on or ancient bed
of some mountain stream, was twenty yards or more in width, the
rocky walls being covered with a mass of luxuriant, creeping vines,
through which the gray of the rocks could be seen only at widely
separated intervals. The bottom was piled up with the luxuriant
vegetable growth of a soil surcharged with richness.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton took only time enough to comprehend these points
when he set to work kindling a fire against the trunk of a tree
which grew close to the ravine. When that was fairly going, he
cut the choicest slices from his game, and it was speedily broiled
over the blaze. There was no water, so far as he knew, closer
than the creek, but he did not specially miss it. Seasoned by
his keen hunger, the venison was the very acme of deliciousness,
and he ate until he craved no more.</p>

<p>Then as he sat down on the leaves with his back to the tree opposite
the blaze, he probably felt as comfortable as one in his situation
could feel. He had pushed his strength almost to a dangerous verge,
when rest became a luxury, and as he leaned against the shaggy
bark behind him, it seemed as though he could sit thus for many
hours without wishing to stir a limb.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said to himself in a drowsy tone, "that I ought
to keep on the tramp until night, when I can crawl in behind some
log and sleep till morning. It may be that one or two of the warriors
from that last village are on my trail, but it don't look like
it, and a fellow can't tramp forever without rest. I'll stop here
for an hour or two, and then go ahead until dark. There's one
thing certain, &mdash;I've thrown Ogallah and his friends so far
off my track that they'll never be able to find it again."</p>

<p>If any conclusion could be warranted, it would seem that this
was of that nature, and yet by an extraordinary chain of circumstances
the very danger which was supposed to have ended, was the one
which came upon the fugitive.</p>

<p>As he had anticipated, the method of his flight was discovered
very early the succeeding morning, and many of the warriors and
large boys started in pursuit. The hunt was pressed with a promptness
and skill scarcely conceivable. It was inevitable that they should
be puzzled by the singular proceeding with the canoes, and the
pursuers became scattered, each intent on following out his own
theory, as is the case with a party of detectives in these later
days. The last boat was not found, but the identical youth who
had fared so ill at the hands of Jack, came upon his trail where
it left the river. His black eyes glowed with anticipated revenge,
which is one of the most blissful emotions that can stir the heart
of the American Indian.</p>

<p>The young Sauk might have brought a half dozen older warriors
around him by uttering a simple signal, but nothing could have
induced him to do so. He had his gun, knife, and tomahawk,&mdash;all
the weapons he could carry and all that were possibly needed.
He had learned long before to trail his people through the labyrinthine
forest, and in a year more he expected to go upon his first war
trail. He hated with an inextinguishable hatred the pale face
who had overthrown him in the wrestling bout and then had struck
him a blow in the face, which, figuratively speaking, compelled
him to carry his nose for several days in a sling. Ogallah had
protected the sick pale face from molestation, but now the chief
was the most eager for his death.</p>

<p>The fugitive evidently believed he was safe against all pursuit,
and it would therefore be the easier to surprise him. What greater
feat could the young Sauk perform than to follow and secretly
slay the detested lad? What a triumph it would be to return to
the village with his scalp dangling at his girdle!</p>

<p>Holding his peace (though it was hard to keep down the shout
of joy that rose to his lips), he bounded away like a bloodhound
in pursuit.</p>

<p>Despite the precautions taken by Jack Carleton, the pursuer found
little trouble in keeping to his trail, until it abruptly terminated
on the bank of the creek, where advantage had been taken of the
canoe. There he paused for a time at a loss what to do.</p>

<p>Of course he knew of the Indian village at no great distance
down stream and on the other side. Familiar as he was with the
creek, he kept on until he reached a place where it broadened
and was so shallow that he waded over without trouble. The red
men whom he visited were friendly with the offshoot of the Sauk
tribe, so that no risk was run in going among them. When he did
so, as a matter of course, he gained the very information he was
seeking; the canoe with the fugitive in it went by the village
early in the morning. The pursuer declined the offer of help and
went on alone. He was hardly outside the village when he struck
the trail again, and, knowing he was at no great distance from
the youth, he followed with a vigor and persistency that would
not be denied.</p>

<p>But during most of the time he was thus employed, Jack Carleton
was similarly engaged, and, despite the energy of the young Sauk,
the hours slipped by without bringing him a sight of the pale
face, whose scalp he meant to bring back suspended to his girdle.
The fugitive had about recovered his usual health, and he improved
the time while it was his. Had he pushed forward until nightfall
before halting for food or rest, he never would have been overtaken.</p>

<p>But the signs showed the dusky youth that he was close upon the
unsuspicious pale face, and he strode along with the care and
skill of a veteran warrior. Finally his trained senses detected
the smell of burning wood, and a moment later he caught sight
of the camp-fire of Jack Carleton. The Indian stopped, and after
some reconnoitering, concluded he could gain a better view from
the other side the camp. With incredible pains he moved around
to that side and was gratified by a success which glowed in his
swarthy countenance and through his well-knit frame.</p>

<p>He saw the pale face sitting on the ground, with his back against
a tree, his mouth open, and his eyes closed. His gun rested on
the ground beside him, and the wearied fugitive was asleep, and
as helpless as an infant.</p>

<p>The Sauk had only to raise his gun, take a quick aim, and shoot
him dead, before he awoke or learned his danger. He could leap
upon and finish him with his knife, but that would involve some
risk to himself. He decided to drive his tomahawk into the skull
of his victim, and to scalp him immediately after.</p>

<p>As the first step toward doing so, he leaned his rifle against
the nearest tree, so as to leave his arms free, and then, without
any more ado, grasped the handle of his tomahawk and poised himself
with the purpose of hurling it with resistless force and unerring
aim. He was not twenty feet distant from Jack; but while in the
very act of raising the missile above his head, his arm was struck
a side blow so violent as almost to break the bone. The tomahawk
flew from his grasp to the earth, and in a twinkling some one
caught him around the waist, lifted him clear of the ground, ran
rapidly the few paces necessary, and flung him over the rocks
into the ravine!</p>

<p>The Sauk struggled desperately to save himself, but he could
not check, though he retarded his descent. He landed with a force
that knocked the breath from him, but the abundance of vines and
vegetable growth saved his life. After a time he slowly gathered
himself together, and seeing nothing of the enemy who had handled
him so ruthlessly, he slowly climbed to his feet and began picking
his way out of the ravine.</p>

<p>He was compelled to walk a long distance before reaching a place
where he was able to clamber to the level ground above. When at
last he managed to do so, he sat down on a fallen tree to rest
and indulge in a retrospective survey.</p>

<p>His rifle and tomahawk were irrecoverably gone, and nothing would
have induced him to go back to look for them. If his right arm
was not broken, it was so injured and lamed that a long time must
elapse before he could use it, and altogether his enterprise could
only be regarded as a disastrous failure.</p>

<p>"It was an Indian that struck the tomahawk from my grasp," reflected
the victimized Sauk; "he was a terrible warrior!"</p>

<p>The youth was right in each respect, for the name of the Indian
who made such short work with him was Deerfoot the Shawanoe.</p>
