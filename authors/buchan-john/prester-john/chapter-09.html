<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I sat down on a chair and laboured to collect my thoughts. Laputa
had gone, and would return sooner or later with Henriques.  If
I was to remain alive till morning, both of them must be convinced
that I was harmless.  Laputa was probably of that opinion, but
Henriques would recognize me, and I had no wish to have that yellow
miscreant investigating my character. There was only one way out
of it &mdash;I must be incapably drunk.  There was not a drop
of liquor in the store, but I found an old whisky bottle half
full of methylated spirits.  With this I thought I might raise
an atmosphere of bad whisky, and for the rest I must trust to
my meagre gifts as an actor.</p>

<p>Supposing I escaped suspicion, Laputa and Henriques would meet
in the outhouse, and I must find some means of overhearing them. 
Here I was fairly baffled.  There was no window in the outhouse
save in the roof, and they were sure to shut and bolt the door. 
I might conceal myself among the barrels inside; but apart from
the fact that they were likely to search them before beginning
their conference, it was quite certain that they would satisfy
themselves that I was safe in the other end of the building before
going to the outhouse.</p>

<p>Suddenly I thought of the cellar which we had built below the
store. There was an entrance by a trap-door behind the counter,
and another in the outhouse.  I had forgotten the details, but
my hope was that the second was among the barrels.  I shut the
outer door, prised up the trap, and dropped into the vault, which
had been floored roughly with green bricks.  Lighting match after
match, I crawled to the other end and tried to lift the door. 
It would not stir, so I guessed that the barrels were on the top
of it.  Back to the outhouse I went, and found that sure enough
a heavy packing-case was standing on a corner.  I fixed it slightly
open, so as to let me hear, and so arranged the odds and ends
round about it that no one looking from the floor of the outhouse
would guess at its existence.  It occurred to me that the conspirators
would want seats, so I placed two cases at the edge of the heap,
that they might not be tempted to forage in the interior.</p>

<p>This done, I went back to the store and proceeded to rig myself
out for my part.  The cellar had made me pretty dirty, and I added
some new daubs to my face.  My hair had grown longish, and I ran
my hands through it till it stood up like a cockatoo's crest. 
Then I cunningly disposed the methylated spirits in the places
most likely to smell.  I burned a little on the floor, I spilt
some on the counter and on my hands, and I let it dribble over
my coat.  In five minutes I had made the room stink like a shebeen. 
I loosened the collar of my shirt, and when I looked at myself
in the cover of my watch I saw a specimen of debauchery which
would have done credit to a Saturday night's police cell.</p>

<p>By this time the sun had gone down, but I thought it better to
kindle no light.  It was the night of the full moon&mdash;for which
reason, I supposed, Laputa had selected it&mdash;and in an hour or
two the world would be lit with that ghostly radiance.  I sat
on the counter while the minutes passed, and I confess I found
the time of waiting very trying for my courage.  I had got over
my worst nervousness by having something to do, but whenever I
was idle my fears returned.  Laputa had a big night's work before
him, and must begin soon.  My vigil, I told myself, could not
be long.</p>

<p>My pony was stalled in a rough shed we had built opposite the
store.  I could hear him shaking his head and stamping the ground
above the croaking of the frogs by the Labongo. Presently it seemed
to me that another sound came from behind the store&mdash;the sound
of horses' feet and the rattle of bridles.  It was hushed for
a moment, and then I heard human voices.  The riders had tied
up their horses to a tree and were coming nearer.</p>

<p>I sprawled gracefully on the counter, the empty bottle in my
hand, and my eyes fixed anxiously on the square of the door, which
was filled with the blue glimmer of the late twilight. The square
darkened, and two men peered in.  Colin growled from below the
counter, but with one hand I held the scruff of his neck.</p>

<p>'Hullo,' I said, 'ish that my black friend?  Awfly shorry, old
man, but I've f'nish'd th' whisky.  The bo-o-ottle shempty,' and
I waved it upside down with an imbecile giggle.</p>

<p>Laputa said something which I did not catch.  Henriques laughed
an ugly laugh.</p>

<p>'We had better make certain of him,' he said.</p>

<p>The two argued for a minute, and then Laputa seemed to prevail. 
The door was shut and the key, which I had left in the lock, turned
on me.</p>

<p>I gave them five minutes to get to the outhouse and settle to
business. Then I opened the trap, got into the cellar, and crawled
to the other end.  A ray of light was coming through the partially
raised door.  By a blessed chance some old bricks had been left
behind, and of these I made a footstool, which enabled me to get
my back level with the door and look out. My laager of barrels
was intact, but through a gap I had left I could see the two men
sitting on the two cases I had provided for them.  A lantern was
set between them, and Henriques was drinking out of a metal flask.</p>

<p>He took something &mdash;I could not see what&mdash;out of his pocket,
and held it before his companion.</p>

<p>'Spoils of war,' he said.  'I let Sikitola's men draw first blood.
They needed it to screw up their courage.  Now they are as wild
as Umbooni's.</p>

<p>Laputa asked a question.</p>

<p>'It was the Dutchmen, who were out on the Koodoo Flats with their
cattle.  Man, it's no good being squeamish.  Do you think you
can talk over these surly back-veld fools?  If we had not done
it, the best of their horses would now be over the Berg to give
warning.  Besides, I tell you, Sikitola's men wanted blooding. 
I did for the old swine, Coetzee, with my own hands.  Once he
set his dogs on me, and I don't forget an injury.'</p>

<p>Laputa must have disapproved, for Henriques' voice grew high.</p>

<p>'Run the show the way you please,' he cried; 'but don't blame
me if you make a hash of it.  God, man, do you think you are going
to work a revolution on skim milk?  If I had my will, I would
go in and stick a knife in the drunken hog next door.'</p>

<p>'He is safe enough,' Laputa replied.  'I gave him the chance
of life, and he laughed at me.  He won't get far on his road home.'</p>

<p>This was pleasant hearing for me, but I scarcely thought of myself. 
I was consumed with a passion of fury against the murdering yellow
devil. With Laputa I was not angry; he was an open enemy, playing
a fair game. But my fingers itched to get at the Portugoose&mdash;that
double-dyed traitor to his race.  As I thought of my kindly old
friends, lying butchered with their kinsfolk out in the bush,
hot tears of rage came to my eyes. Perfect love casteth out fear,
the Bible says; but, to speak it reverently, so does perfect hate. 
Not for safety and a king's ransom would I have drawn back from
the game.  I prayed for one thing only, that God in His mercy
would give me the chance of settling with Henriques.</p>

<p>I fancy I missed some of the conversation, being occupied with
my own passion.  At any rate, when I next listened the two were
deep in plans. Maps were spread beside them, and Laputa's delicate
forefinger was tracing a route.  I strained my ears, but could
catch only a few names. Apparently they were to keep in the plains
till they had crossed the Klein Labongo and the Letaba.  I thought
I caught the name of the ford of the latter; it sounded like Dupree's
Drift.  After that the talk became plainer, for Laputa was explaining
in his clear voice. The force would leave the bush, ascend the
Berg by the glen of the Groot Letaba, and the first halt would
be called at a place called Inanda's Kraal, where a promontory
of the high-veld juts out behind the peaks called the Wolkberg
or Cloud Mountains.  All this was very much to the point, and
the names sunk into my memory like a die into wax.</p>

<p>'Meanwhile,' said Laputa, 'there is the gathering at Ntabakaikonjwa.[1]
It will take us three hours' hard riding to get there.'</p>

<p>Where on earth was Ntabakaikonjwa?  It must be the native name
for the Rooirand, for after all Laputa was not likely to use the
Dutch word for his own sacred place.</p>

<p>'Nothing has been forgotten.  The men are massed below the cliffs,
and the chiefs and the great indunas will enter the Place of the
Snake. The door will be guarded, and only the password will get
a man through. That word is "Immanuel," which means, "God with
us."'</p>

<p>'Well, when we get there, what happens?' Henriques asked with
a laugh. 'What kind of magic will you spring on us?'</p>

<p>There was a strong contrast between the flippant tone of the
Portugoose and the grave voice which answered him.</p>

<p>'The Keeper of the Snake will open the holy place, and bring
forth the Isetembiso sami.[2]  As the leader of my people, I will
assume the collar of Umkulunkulu in the name of our God and the
spirits of the great dead.'</p>

<p>'But you don't propose to lead the march in a necklace of rubies,'
said Henriques, with a sudden eagerness in his voice.</p>

<p>Again Laputa spoke gravely, and, as it were, abstractedly.  I
heard the voice of one whose mind was fixed on a far horizon.</p>

<p>'When I am acclaimed king, I restore the Snake to its Keeper,
and swear never to clasp it on my neck till I have led my people
to victory.'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Henriques.  'What about the purification you mentioned?'</p>

<p>I had missed this before and listened earnestly.</p>

<p>'The vows we take in the holy place bind us till we are purged
of them at Inanda's Kraal.  Till then no blood must be shed and
no flesh eaten. It was the fashion of our forefathers.'</p>

<p>'Well, I think you've taken on a pretty risky job,' Henriques
said. 'You propose to travel a hundred miles, binding yourself
not to strike a blow.  It is simply putting yourself at the mercy
of any police patrol.'</p>

<p>'There will be no patrol,' Laputa replied.  'Our march will be
as secret and as swift as death.  I have made my preparations.'</p>

<p>'But suppose you met with opposition,' the Portugoose persisted,
'would the rule hold?'</p>

<p>'If any try to stop us, we shall tie them hand and foot, and
carry them with us.  Their fate will be worse than if they had
been slain in battle.'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Henriques, whistling through his teeth.  'Well,
before we start this vow business, I think I'll go back and settle
that storekeeper.'</p>

<p>Laputa shook his head.  'Will you be serious and hear me? We
have no time to knife harmless fools.  Before we start for Ntabakaikonjwa
I must have from you the figures of the arming in the south. 
That is the one thing which remains to be settled.'</p>

<p>I am certain these figures would have been most interesting,
but I never heard them.  My feet were getting cramped with standing
on the bricks, and I inadvertently moved them.  The bricks came
down with a rattle, and unfortunately in slipping I clutched at
the trap.  This was too much for my frail prop, and the door slammed
down with a great noise.</p>

<p>Here was a nice business for the eavesdropper!  I scurried along
the passage as stealthily as I could and clambered back into the
store, while I heard the sound of Laputa and Henriques ferreting
among the barrels.  I managed to throttle Colin and prevent him
barking, but I could not get the confounded trap to close behind
me.  Something had jammed in it, and it remained half a foot open.</p>

<p>I heard the two approaching the door, and I did the best thing
that occurred to me.  I pulled Colin over the trap, rolled on
the top of him, and began to snore heavily as if in a drunken
slumber.</p>

<p>The key was turned, and the gleam of a lantern was thrown on
the wall. It flew up and down as its bearer cast the light into
the corners.</p>

<p>'By God, he's gone,' I heard Henriques say.  'The swine was listening,
and he has bolted now.'</p>

<p>'He won't bolt far,' Laputa said.  'He is here.  He is snoring
behind the counter.'</p>

<p>These were anxious moments for me.  I had a firm grip on Colin's
throat, but now and then a growl escaped, which was fortunately
blended with my snores.  I felt that a lantern was flashed on
me, and that the two men were peering down at the heap on the
half-opened trap.  I think that was the worst minute I ever spent,
for, as I have said, my courage was not so bad in action, but
in a passive game it oozed out of my fingers.</p>

<p>'He is safe enough,' Laputa said, after what seemed to me an
eternity. 'The noise was only the rats among the barrels.' I thanked
my Maker that they had not noticed the other trap-door. 'All the
same I think I'll make him safer,' said Henriques.</p>

<p>Laputa seemed to have caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>'Come back and get to business,' he said.  'I've told you I'll
have no more murder.  You will do as I tell you, Mr Henriques.'</p>

<p>I did not catch the answer, but the two went out and locked the
door. I patted the outraged Colin, and got to my feet with an
aching side where the confounded lid of the trap had been pressing. 
There was no time to lose for the two in the outhouse would soon
be setting out, and I must be before them.</p>

<p>With no better light than a ray of the moon through the window,
I wrote a message on a leaf from my pocket-book.  I told of the
plans I had overheard, and especially I mentioned Dupree's Drift
on the Letaba.  I added that I was going to the Rooirand to find
the secret of the cave, and in one final sentence implored Arcoll
to do justice on the Portugoose.  That was all, for I had no time
for more.  I carefully tied the paper with a string below the
collar of the dog.</p>

<p>Then very quietly I went into the bedroom next door&mdash;the side
of the store farthest from the outhouse.  The place was flooded
with moonlight, and the window stood open, as I had left it in
the afternoon.  As softly as I could I swung Colin over the sill
and clambered after him.  In my haste I left my coat behind me
with my pistol in the pocket.</p>

<p>Now came a check.  My horse was stabled in the shed, and that
was close to the outhouse.  The sound of leading him out would
most certainly bring Laputa and Henriques to the door. In that
moment I all but changed my plans.  I thought of slipping back
to the outhouse and trying to shoot the two men as they came forth. 
But I reflected that, before I could get them both, one or other
would probably shoot me. Besides, I had a queer sort of compunction
about killing Laputa.  I understood now why Arcoll had stayed
his hand from murder, and I was beginning to be of his opinion
on our arch-enemy.</p>

<p>Then I remembered the horses tied up in the bush.  One of them
I could get with perfect safety.  I ran round the end of the store
and into the thicket, keeping on soft grass to dull my tread. 
There, tied up to a merula tree, were two of the finest beasts
I had seen in Africa.  I selected the better, an Africander stallion
of the <em>blaauw-schimmel</em>, or blue-roan type, which is famous
for speed and endurance.  Slipping his bridle from the branch,
I led him a little way into the bush in the direction of the Rooirand.</p>

<p>Then I spoke to Colin.  'Home with you,' I said.  'Home, old
man, as if you were running down a tsessebe.'[3]</p>

<p>The dog seemed puzzled.  'Home,' I said again, pointing west
in the direction of the Berg.  'Home, you brute.'</p>

<p>And then he understood.  He gave one low whine, and cast a reproachful
eye on me and the blue roan.  Then he turned, and with his head
down set off with great lopes on the track of the road I had ridden
in the morning.</p>

<p>A second later and I was in the saddle, riding hell-for-leather
for the north.</p>

<p>[1] Literally, 'The Hill which is not to be pointed at'.</p>

<p>[2] Literally, 'Very sacred thing'.</p>

<p>[3] A species of buck, famous for its speed.</p>
