<p>On Monday morning, the day after Ray Kennedy's funeral, Dr. Archie
called at Mr. Kronborg's study, a little room behind the church. Mr.
Kronborg did not write out his sermons, but spoke from notes jotted upon
small pieces of cardboard in a kind of shorthand of his own. As sermons
go, they were not worse than most. His conventional rhetoric pleased the
majority of his congregation, and Mr. Kronborg was generally regarded as
a model preacher. He did not smoke, he never touched spirits. His
indulgence in the pleasures of the table was an endearing bond between
him and the women of his congregation. He ate enormously, with a zest
which seemed incongruous with his spare frame.
</p><p>This morning the doctor found him opening his mail and reading a pile of
advertising circulars with deep attention.
</p><p>“Good-morning, Mr. Kronborg,” said Dr. Archie, sitting down. “I came to
see you on business. Poor Kennedy asked me to look after his affairs for
him. Like most railroad men he spent his wages, except for a few
investments in mines which don't look to me very promising. But his life
was insured for six hundred dollars in Thea's favor.”
</p><p>Mr. Kronborg wound his feet about the standard of his desk-chair. “I
assure you, doctor, this is a complete surprise to me.”
</p><p>“Well, it's not very surprising to me,” Dr. Archie went on. “He talked
to me about it the day he was hurt. He said he wanted the money to be
used in a particular way, and in no other.” Dr. Archie paused meaningly.
</p><p>Mr. Kronborg fidgeted. “I am sure Thea would observe his wishes in every
respect.”
</p><p>“No doubt; but he wanted me to see that you agreed to his plan. It seems
that for some time Thea has wanted to go away to study music. It was
Kennedy's wish that she should take this money and go to Chicago this
winter. He felt that it would be an advantage to her in a business way:
that even if she came back here to teach, it would give her more
authority and make her position here more comfortable.”
</p><p>Mr. Kronborg looked a little startled. “She is very young,” he
hesitated; “she is barely seventeen. Chicago is a long way from home. We
would have to consider. I think, Dr. Archie, we had better consult Mrs.
Kronborg.”
</p><p>“I think I can bring Mrs. Kronborg around, if I have your consent. I've
always found her pretty level-headed. I have several old classmates
practicing in Chicago. One is a throat specialist. He has a good deal to
do with singers. He probably knows the best piano teachers and could
recommend a boarding-house where music students stay. I think Thea needs
to get among a lot of young people who are clever like herself. Here she
has no companions but old fellows like me. It's not a natural life for a
young girl. She'll either get warped, or wither up before her time. If
it will make you and Mrs. Kronborg feel any easier, I'll be glad to take
Thea to Chicago and see that she gets started right. This throat man I
speak of is a big fellow in his line, and if I can get him interested,
he may be able to put her in the way of a good many things. At any rate,
he'll know the right teachers. Of course, six hundred dollars won't take
her very far, but even half the winter there would be a great advantage.
I think Kennedy sized the situation up exactly.”
</p><p>“Perhaps; I don't doubt it. You are very kind, Dr. Archie.” Mr. Kronborg
was ornamenting his desk-blotter with hieroglyphics. “I should think
Denver might be better. There we could watch over her. She is very
young.”
</p><p>Dr. Archie rose. “Kennedy didn't mention Denver. He said Chicago,
repeatedly. Under the circumstances, it seems to me we ought to try to
carry out his wishes exactly, if Thea is willing.”
</p><p>“Certainly, certainly. Thea is conscientious. She would not waste her
opportunities.” Mr. Kronborg paused. “If Thea were your own daughter,
doctor, would you consent to such a plan, at her present age?”
</p><p>“I most certainly should. In fact, if she were my daughter, I'd have
sent her away before this. She's a most unusual child, and she's only
wasting herself here. At her age she ought to be learning, not teaching.
She'll never learn so quickly and easily as she will right now.”
</p><p>“Well, doctor, you had better talk it over with Mrs. Kronborg. I make it
a point to defer to her wishes in such matters. She understands all her
children perfectly. I may say that she has all a mother's insight, and
more.”
</p><p>Dr. Archie smiled. “Yes, and then some. I feel quite confident about
Mrs. Kronborg. We usually agree. Good-morning.”
</p><p>Dr. Archie stepped out into the hot sunshine and walked rapidly toward
his office, with a determined look on his face. He found his
waiting-room full of patients, and it was one o'clock before he had
dismissed the last one. Then he shut his door and took a drink before
going over to the hotel for his lunch. He smiled as he locked his
cupboard. “I feel almost as gay as if I were going to get away for a
winter myself,” he thought.
</p>
<p>Afterward Thea could never remember much about that summer, or how she
lived through her impatience. She was to set off with Dr. Archie on the
fifteenth of October, and she gave lessons until the first of September.
Then she began to get her clothes ready, and spent whole afternoons in
the village dressmaker's stuffy, littered little sewing-room. Thea and
her mother made a trip to Denver to buy the materials for her dresses.
Ready-made clothes for girls were not to be had in those days. Miss
Spencer, the dressmaker, declared that she could do handsomely by Thea
if they would only let her carry out her own ideas. But Mrs. Kronborg
and Thea felt that Miss Spencer's most daring productions might seem out
of place in Chicago, so they restrained her with a firm hand. Tillie,
who always helped Mrs. Kronborg with the family sewing, was for letting
Miss Spencer challenge Chicago on Thea's person. Since Ray Kennedy's
death, Thea had become more than ever one of Tillie's heroines. Tillie
swore each of her friends to secrecy, and, coming home from church or
leaning over the fence, told them the most touching stories about Ray's
devotion, and how Thea would “never get over it.”
</p><p>Tillie's confidences stimulated the general discussion of Thea's
venture. This discussion went on, upon front porches and in back yards,
pretty much all summer. Some people approved of Thea's going to Chicago,
but most people did not. There were others who changed their minds about
it every day.
</p><p>Tillie said she wanted Thea to have a ball dress “above all things.” She
bought a fashion book especially devoted to evening clothes and looked
hungrily over the colored plates, picking out costumes that would be
becoming to “a blonde.” She wanted Thea to have all the gay clothes she
herself had always longed for; clothes she often told herself she needed
“to recite in.”
</p><p>“Tillie,” Thea used to cry impatiently, “can't you see that if Miss
Spencer tried to make one of those things, she'd make me look like a
circus girl? Anyhow, I don't know anybody in Chicago. I won't be going
to parties.”
</p><p>Tillie always replied with a knowing toss of her head, “You see! You'll
be in society before you know it. There ain't many girls as accomplished
as you.”
</p><p>On the morning of the fifteenth of October the Kronborg family, all of
them but Gus, who couldn't leave the store, started for the station an
hour before train time. Charley had taken Thea's trunk and telescope to
the depot in his delivery wagon early that morning. Thea wore her new
blue serge traveling-dress, chosen for its serviceable qualities. She
had done her hair up carefully, and had put a pale-blue ribbon around
her throat, under a little lace collar that Mrs. Kohler had crocheted
for her. As they went out of the gate, Mrs. Kronborg looked her over
thoughtfully. Yes, that blue ribbon went very well with the dress, and
with Thea's eyes. Thea had a rather unusual touch about such things, she
reflected comfortably. Tillie always said that Thea was “so indifferent
to dress,” but her mother noticed that she usually put her clothes on
well. She felt the more at ease about letting Thea go away from home,
because she had good sense about her clothes and never tried to dress up
too much. Her coloring was so individual, she was so unusually fair,
that in the wrong clothes she might easily have been “conspicuous.”
</p><p>It was a fine morning, and the family set out from the house in good
spirits. Thea was quiet and calm. She had forgotten nothing, and she
clung tightly to her handbag, which held her trunk-key and all of her
money that was not in an envelope pinned to her chemise. Thea walked
behind the others, holding Thor by the hand, and this time she did not
feel that the procession was too long. Thor was uncommunicative that
morning, and would only talk about how he would rather get a sand bur in
his toe every day than wear shoes and stockings. As they passed the
cottonwood grove where Thea often used to bring him in his cart, she
asked him who would take him for nice long walks after sister went away.
</p><p>“Oh, I can walk in our yard,” he replied unappreciatively. “I guess I
can make a pond for my duck.”
</p><p>Thea leaned down and looked into his face. “But you won't forget about
sister, will you?” Thor shook his head. “And won't you be glad when
sister comes back and can take you over to Mrs. Kohler's to see the
pigeons?”
</p><p>“Yes, I'll be glad. But I'm going to have a pigeon my own self.”
</p><p>“But you haven't got any little house for one. Maybe Axel would make you
a little house.”
</p><p>“Oh, her can live in the barn, her can,” Thor drawled indifferently.
</p><p>Thea laughed and squeezed his hand. She always liked his sturdy
matter-of-factness. Boys ought to be like that, she thought.
</p><p>When they reached the depot, Mr. Kronborg paced the platform somewhat
ceremoniously with his daughter. Any member of his flock would have
gathered that he was giving her good counsel about meeting the
temptations of the world. He did, indeed, begin to admonish her not to
forget that talents come from our Heavenly Father and are to be used for
his glory, but he cut his remarks short and looked at his watch. He
believed that Thea was a religious girl, but when she looked at him with
that intent, that passionately inquiring gaze which used to move even
Wunsch, Mr. Kronborg suddenly felt his eloquence fail. Thea was like her
mother, he reflected; you couldn't put much sentiment across with her.
As a usual thing, he liked girls to be a little more responsive. He
liked them to blush at his compliments; as Mrs. Kronborg candidly said,
“Father could be very soft with the girls.” But this morning he was
thinking that hard-headedness was a reassuring quality in a daughter who
was going to Chicago alone.
</p><p>Mr. Kronborg believed that big cities were places where people went to
lose their identity and to be wicked. He himself, when he was a student
at the Seminary--he coughed and opened his watch again. He knew, of
course, that a great deal of business went on in Chicago, that there was
an active Board of Trade, and that hogs and cattle were slaughtered
there. But when, as a young man, he had stopped over in Chicago, he had
not interested himself in the commercial activities of the city. He
remembered it as a place full of cheap shows and dance halls and boys
from the country who were behaving disgustingly.
</p><p>Dr. Archie drove up to the station about ten minutes before the train
was due. His man tied the ponies and stood holding the doctor's
alligator-skin bag--very elegant, Thea thought it. Mrs. Kronborg did not
burden the doctor with warnings and cautions. She said again that she
hoped he could get Thea a comfortable place to stay, where they had good
beds, and she hoped the landlady would be a woman who'd had children of
her own. “I don't go much on old maids looking after girls,” she
remarked as she took a pin out of her own hat and thrust it into Thea's
blue turban. “You'll be sure to lose your hatpins on the train, Thea.
It's better to have an extra one in case.” She tucked in a little curl
that had escaped from Thea's careful twist. “Don't forget to brush your
dress often, and pin it up to the curtains of your berth to-night, so it
won't wrinkle. If you get it wet, have a tailor press it before it
draws.”
</p><p>She turned Thea about by the shoulders and looked her over a last time.
Yes, she looked very well. She wasn't pretty, exactly,--her face was too
broad and her nose was too big. But she had that lovely skin, and she
looked fresh and sweet. She had always been a sweet-smelling child. Her
mother had always liked to kiss her, when she happened to think of it.
</p><p>The train whistled in, and Mr. Kronborg carried the canvas “telescope”
 into the car. Thea kissed them all good-bye. Tillie cried, but she was
the only one who did. They all shouted things up at the closed window of
the Pullman car, from which Thea looked down at them as from a frame,
her face glowing with excitement, her turban a little tilted in spite of
three hatpins. She had already taken off her new gloves to save them.
Mrs. Kronborg reflected that she would never see just that same picture
again, and as Thea's car slid off along the rails, she wiped a tear from
her eye. “She won't come back a little girl,” Mrs. Kronborg said to her
husband as they turned to go home. “Anyhow, she's been a sweet one.”
</p><p>While the Kronborg family were trooping slowly homeward, Thea was
sitting in the Pullman, her telescope in the seat beside her, her
handbag tightly gripped in her fingers. Dr. Archie had gone into the
smoker. He thought she might be a little tearful, and that it would be
kinder to leave her alone for a while. Her eyes did fill once, when she
saw the last of the sand hills and realized that she was going to leave
them behind for a long while. They always made her think of Ray, too.
She had had such good times with him out there.
</p><p>But, of course, it was herself and her own adventure that mattered to
her. If youth did not matter so much to itself, it would never have the
heart to go on. Thea was surprised that she did not feel a deeper sense
of loss at leaving her old life behind her. It seemed, on the contrary,
as she looked out at the yellow desert speeding by, that she had left
very little. Everything that was essential seemed to be right there in
the car with her. She lacked nothing. She even felt more compact and
confident than usual. She was all there, and something else was there,
too,--in her heart, was it, or under her cheek? Anyhow, it was about her
somewhere, that warm sureness, that sturdy little companion with whom
she shared a secret.
</p><p>When Dr. Archie came in from the smoker, she was sitting still, looking
intently out of the window and smiling, her lips a little parted, her
hair in a blaze of sunshine. The doctor thought she was the prettiest
thing he had ever seen, and very funny, with her telescope and big
handbag. She made him feel jolly, and a little mournful, too. He knew
that the splendid things of life are few, after all, and so very easy to
miss.
