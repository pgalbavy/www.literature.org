THAT night the bishop had a temperature of a hundred and a
half. The doctor pronounced him to be in a state of intense
mental excitement, aggravated by some drug. He was a doctor
modern and clear-minded enough to admit that he could not
identify the drug. He overruled, every one overruled, the
bishop's declaration that he had done with the church, that he
could never mock God with his episcopal ministrations again, that
he must proceed at once with his resignation. "Don't think of
these things," said the doctor. "Banish them from your mind until
your temperature is down to ninety-eight. Then after a rest you
may go into them."
<P>
Lady Ella insisted upon his keeping his room. It was with
difficulty that he got her to admit Whippham, and Whippham was
exasperatingly in order. "You need not trouble about anything
now, my lord," he said. "Everything will keep until you are ready
to attend to it. It's well we're through with Easter. Bishop
Buncombe of Eastern Blowdesia was coming here anyhow. And there
is Canon Bliss. There's only two ordination candidates because of
the war. We'll get on swimmingly."
<P>
The bishop thought he would like to talk to those two
ordination candidates, but they prevailed upon him not to do so.
He lay for the best part of one night confiding remarkable things
to two imaginary ordination candidates.
<P>
He developed a marked liking for Eleanor's company. She was
home again now after a visit to some friends. It was decided that
the best thing to do with him would be to send him away in her
charge. A journey abroad was impossible. France would remind him
too dreadfully of the war. His own mind turned suddenly to the
sweet air of Hunstanton. He had gone there at times to read, in
the old Cambridge days. "It is a terribly ugly place," he said,
"but it is wine in the veins."
<P>
Lady Ella was doubtful about Zeppelins. Thrice they had been
right over Hunstanton already. They came in by the easy landmark
of the Wash.
<P>
"It will interest him," said Eleanor, who knew her father
better.
<P>
(2)
<P>
<P>
One warm and still and sunny afternoon the bishop found himself
looking out upon the waters of the Wash. He sat where the highest
pebble layers of the beach reached up to a little cliff of sandy
earth perhaps a foot high, and he looked upon sands and sea and
sky and saw that they were beautiful.
<P>
He was a little black-gaitered object in a scene of the most
exquisite and delicate colour. Right and left of him stretched
the low grey salted shore, pale banks of marly earth surmounted
by green-grey wiry grass that held and was half buried in fine
blown sand. Above, the heavens made a complete hemisphere of blue
in which a series of remote cumulus clouds floated and dissolved.
Before him spread the long levels of the sands, and far away at
its utmost ebb was the sea. Eleanor had gone to explore the black
ribs of a wrecked fishing-boat that lay at the edge of a shallow
lagoon. She was a little pink-footed figure, very bright and
apparently transparent. She had reverted for a time to shameless
childishness; she had hidden her stockings among the reeds of the
bank, and she was running to and fro, from star-fish to razor
shell and from cockle to weed. The shingle was pale drab and
purple close at hand, but to the westward, towards Hunstanton,
the sands became brown and purple, and were presently broken up
into endless skerries of low flat weed-covered boulders and
little intensely blue pools. The sea was a band of sapphire that
became silver to the west; it met the silver shining sands in one
delicate breathing edge of intensely white foam. Remote to the
west, very small and black and clear against the afternoon sky,
was a cart, and about it was a score or so of mussel-gatherers. A
little nearer, on an apparently empty stretch of shining wet
sand, a multitude of gulls was mysteriously busy. These two
groups of activities and Eleanor's flitting translucent movements
did but set off and emphasize the immense and soothing
tranquillity.
<P>
For a long time the bishop sat passively receptive to this
healing beauty. Then a little flow of thought began and gathered
in his mind. He had come out to think over two letters that he
had brought with him. He drew these now rather reluctantly from
his pocket, and after a long pause over the envelopes began to
read them.
<P>
He reread Likeman's letter first.
<P>
Likeman could not forgive him.
<P>
"My dear Scrope," he wrote, "your explanation explains nothing.
This sensational declaration of infidelity to our mother church,
made under the most damning and distressing circumstances in the
presence of young and tender minds entrusted to your
ministrations, and in defiance of the honourable engagements
implied in the confirmation service, confirms my worst
apprehensions of the weaknesses of your character. I have always
felt the touch of theatricality in your temperament, the peculiar
craving to be pseudo-deeper, pseudo-simpler than us all, the need
of personal excitement. I know that you were never quite
contented to believe in God at second-hand. You wanted to be
taken notice of--personally. Except for some few hints to you,
I have never breathed a word of these doubts to any human being;
I have always hoped that the ripening that comes with years and
experience would give you an increasing strength against the
dangers of emotionalism and against your strong, deep, quiet
sense of your exceptional personal importance...."
<P>
The bishop read thus far, and then sat reflecting.
<P>
Was it just?
<P>
He had many weaknesses, but had he this egotism? No; that
wasn't the justice of the case. The old man, bitterly
disappointed, was endeavouring to wound. Scrope asked himself
whether he was to blame for that disappointment. That was a more
difficult question....
<P>
He dismissed the charge at last, crumpled up the letter in his
hand, and after a moment's hesitation flung it away.... But he
remained acutely sorry, not so much for himself as for the
revelation of Likeman this letter made. He had had a great
affection for Likeman and suddenly it was turned into a wound.
<P>
(3)
<P>
<P>
The second letter was from Lady Sunderbund, and it was an
altogether more remarkable document. Lady Sunderbund wrote on a
notepaper that was evidently the result of a perverse research,
but she wrote a letter far more coherent than her speech, and
without that curious falling away of the r's that flavoured even
her gravest observations with an unjust faint aroma of absurdity.
She wrote with a thin pen in a rounded boyish handwriting. She
italicized with slashes of the pen.
<P>
He held this letter in both hands between his knees, and
considered it now with an expression that brought his eyebrows
forward until they almost met, and that tucked in the corners of
his mouth.
<P>
"My dear Bishop," it began.
<P>
"I keep thinking and thinking and thinking of that wonderful
service, of the wonderful, wonderful things you said, and the
wonderful choice you made of the moment to say them--when all
those young lives were coming to the great serious thing in life.
It was most beautifully done. At any rate, dear Bishop and
Teacher, it was most beautifully begun. And now we all stand to
you like creditors because you have given us so much that you owe
us ever so much more. You have started us and you have to go on
with us. You have broken the shell of the old church, and here we
are running about with nowhere to go. You have to make the
shelter of a new church now for us, purged of errors, looking
straight to God. The King of Mankind!--what a wonderful,
wonderful phrase that is. It says everything. Tell us more of him
and more. Count me first--not foremost, but just the little one
that runs in first--among your disciples. They say you are
resigning your position in the church. Of course that must be
true. You are coming out of it--what did you call it?--coming
out of the cracked old vessel from which you have poured the
living waters. I called on Lady Ella yesterday. She did not tell
me very much; I think she is a very reserved as well as a very
dignified woman, but she said that you intended to go to London.
In London then I suppose you will set up the first altar to the
Divine King. I want to help.
<P>
"Dear Bishop and Teacher, I want to help tremendously--with
all my heart and all my soul. I want to be let do things for
you." (The "you" was erased by three or four rapid slashes, and
"our King" substituted.) "I want to be privileged to help build
that First Church of the World Unified under God. It is a
dreadful thing to says but, you see, I am very rich; this
dreadful war has made me ever so much richer--steel and
shipping and things--it is my trustees have done it. I am
ashamed to be so rich. I want to give. I want to give and help
this great beginning of yours. I want you to let me help on the
temporal side, to make it easy for you to stand forth and deliver
your message, amidst suitable surroundings and without any horrid
worries on account of the sacrifices you have made. Please do not
turn my offering aside. I have never wanted anything so much in
all my life as I want to make this gift. Unless I can make it I
feel that for me there is no salvation! I shall stick with my
loads and loads of stocks and shares and horrid possessions
outside the Needle's Eye. But if I could build a temple for God,
and just live somewhere near it so as to be the poor woman who
sweeps out the chapels, and die perhaps and be buried under its
floor! Don't smile at me. I mean every word of it. Years ago I
thought of such a thing. After I had visited the Certosa di Pavia
--do you know it? So beautiful, and those two still alabaster
figures--recumbent. But until now I could never see my way to
any such service. Now I do. I am all afire to do it. Help me!
Tell me! Let me stand behind you and make your mission possible.
I feel I have come to the most wonderful phase in my life. I feel
my call has come....
<P>
<P>
"I have written this letter over three times, and torn each of
them up. I do so want to say all this, and it is so desperately
hard to say. I am full of fears that you despise me. I know there
is a sort of high colour about me. My passion for brightness. I
am absurd. But inside of me is a soul, a real, living, breathing
soul. Crying out to you: 'Oh, let me help! Let me help!' I will
do anything, I will endure anything if only I can keep hold of
the vision splendid you gave me in the cathedral. I see it now
day and night, the dream of the place I can make for you--and
you preaching! My fingers itch to begin. The day before yesterday
I said to myself, 'I am quite unworthy, I am a worldly woman, a
rich, smart, decorated woman. He will never accept me as I am.' I
took off all my jewels, every one, I looked through all my
clothes, and at last I decided I would have made for me a very
simple straight grey dress, just simple and straight and grey.
Perhaps you will think that too is absurd of me, too
self-conscious. I would not tell of it to you if I did not want
you to understand how alive I am to my utter impossibilities, how
resolved I am to do anything so that I may be able to serve. But
never mind about silly me; let me tell you how I see the new
church.
<P>
<P>
"I think you ought to have some place near the centre of
London; not too west, for you might easily become fashionable,
not too east because you might easily be swallowed up in merely
philanthropic work, but somewhere between the two. There must be
vacant sites still to be got round about Kingsway. And there we
must set up your tabernacle, a very plain, very simple, very
beautifully proportioned building in which you can give your
message. I know a young man, just the very young man to do
something of the sort, something quite new, quite modern, and yet
solemn and serious. Lady Ella seemed to think you wanted to live
somewhere in the north-west of London--but she would tell me
very little. I seem to see you not there at all, not in anything
between west-end and suburb, but yourself as central as your
mind, in a kind of clergy house that will be part of the
building. That is how it is in my dream anyhow. All that though
can be settled afterwards. My imagination and my desire is
running away with me. It is no time yet for premature plans. Not
that I am not planning day and night. This letter is simply to
offer. I just want to offer. Here I am and all my worldly goods.
Take me, I pray you. And not only pray you. Take me, I demand of
you, in the name of God our king. I have a right to be used. And
you have no right to refuse me. You have to go on with your
message, and it is your duty to take me--just as you are
obliged to step on any steppingstone that lies on your way to do
God service.... And so I am waiting. I shall be waiting--on
thorns. I know you will take your time and think. But do not take
too much time. Think of me waiting.
<P>
"Your servant, your most humble helper in God (your God),
<P>
                              "AGATHA SUNDERBUND."
<P>
<P>
And then scrawled along the margin of the last sheet:
<P>
<P>
"If, when you know--a telegram. Even if you cannot say so
much as 'Agreed,' still such a word as 'Favourable.' I just hang
over the Void until I hear.
<P>
                                     "AGATHA S."
<P>
<P>
<P>
A letter demanding enormous deliberation. She argued closely in
spite of her italics. It had never dawned upon the bishop before
how light is the servitude of the disciple in comparison with the
servitude of the master. In many ways this proposal repelled and
troubled him, in many ways it attracted him. And the argument of
his clear obligation to accept her co-operation gripped him; it
was a good argument.
<P>
And besides it worked in very conveniently with certain other
difficulties that perplexed him.
<P>

The bishop became aware that Eleanor was returning to him
across the sands. She had made an end to her paddling, she had
put on her shoes and stockings and become once more the grave and
responsible young woman who had been taking care of him since his
flight from Princhester. He replaced the two letters in his
pocket, and sat ready to smile as she drew near; he admired her
open brow, the toss of her hair, and the poise of her head upon
her neck. It was good to note that her hard reading at Cambridge
hadn't bent her shoulders in the least....
<P>
"Well, old Dad! " she said as she drew near. "You've got back a
colour."
<P>
"I've got back everything. It's time I returned to
Princhester."
<P>
"Not in this weather. Not for a day or so." She flung herself
at his feet. "Consider your overworked little daughter. Oh,how
good this is!"
<P>
"No," said the bishop in a grave tone that made her look up
into his face. "I must go hack."
<P>
He met her clear gaze. "What do you think of all this business,
Eleanor?" he asked abruptly. "Do you think I had a sort of fit in
the cathedral?"
<P>
He winced as he asked the question.
<P>
"Daddy," she said, after a little pause; "the things you said
and did that afternoon were the noblest you ever did in your
life. I wish I had been there. It must have been splendid to be
there. I've not told you before--I've been dying to.... I'd
promised not to say a word--not to remind you. I promised the
doctor. But now you ask me, now you are well again, I can tell
you. Kitty Kingdom has told me all about it, how it felt. It was
like light and order coming into a hopeless dark muddle. What you
said was like what we have all been trying to think--I mean all
of us young people. Suddenly it was all clear."
<P>
She stopped short. She was breathless with the excitement of
her confession.
<P>
Her father too remained silent for a little while. He was
reminded of his weakness; he was, he perceived, still a little
hysterical. He felt that he might weep at her youthful enthusiasm
if he did not restrain himself.
<P>
I'm glad," he said, and patted her shoulder. "I'm glad, Norah."
<P>
She looked away from him out across the lank brown sands and
water pools to the sea. "It was what we have all been feeling our
way towards, the absolute simplification of religion, the
absolute simplification of politics and social duty; just God,
just God the King."
<P>
"But should I have said that--in the cathedral?"
<P>
She felt no scruples. "You had to," she said.
<P>
"But now think what it means," he said. "I must leave the
church."
<P>
"As a man strips off his coat for a fight."
<P>
"That doesn't dismay you?"
<P>
She shook her head, and smiled confidently to sea and sky.
<P>
"I'm glad if you're with me," he said. "Sometimes--I think--
I'm not a very self-reliant man."
<P>
"You'll have all the world with you," she was convinced, "in a
little time."
<P>
"Perhaps rather a longer time than you think, Norah. In the
meantime--"
<P>
She turned to him once more.
<P>
"In the meantime there are a great many things to consider.
Young people, they say, never think of the transport that is
needed to win a battle. I have it in my mind that I should leave
the church. But I can't just walk out into the marketplace and
begin preaching there. I see the family furniture being carried
out of the palace and put into vans. It has to go somewhere...."
<P>
"I suppose you will go to London."
<P>
"Possibly. In fact certainly. I have a plan. Or at least an
opportunity.... But that isn't what I have most in mind. These
things are not done without emotion and a considerable strain
upon one's personal relationships. I do not think this--I do
not think your mother sees things as we do."
<P>
"She will," said young enthusiasm, "when she understands."
<P>
"I wish she did. But I have been unlucky in the circumstances
of my explanations to her. And of course you understand all this
means risks--poverty perhaps--going without things--travel,
opportunity, nice possessions--for all of us. A loss of
position too. All this sort of thing," he stuck out a gaitered
calf and smiled, "will have to go. People, some of them, may be
disasagreeable to us...."
<P>
"After all, Daddy," she said, smiling, "it isn't so bad as the
cross and the lions and burning pitch. And you have the Truth."
<P>
"You do believe--?" He left his sentence unfinished.
<P>
She nodded, her face aglow. "We know you have the Truth."
<P>
"Of course in my own mind now it is very clear. I had a kind of
illumination...." He would have tried to tell her of his vision,
and he was too shy. "It came to me suddenly that the whole world
was in confusion because men followed after a thousand different
immediate aims, when really it was quite easy, if only one could
be simple it was quite easy, to show that nearly all men could
only be fully satisfied and made happy in themselves by one
single aim, which was also the aim that would make the whole
world one great order, and that aim was to make God King of one's
heart and the whole world. I saw that all this world, except for
a few base monstrous spirits, was suffering hideous things
because of this war, and before the war it was full of folly,
waste, social injustice and suspicion for the same reason,
because it had not realized the kingship of God. And that is so
simple; the essence of God is simplicity. The sin of this war
lies with men like myself, men who set up to tell people about
God, more than it lies with any other class--"
<P>
"Kings?" she interjected. "Diplomatists? Finance?"
<P>
"Yes. Those men could only work mischief in the world because
the priests and teachers let them. All things human lie at last
at the door of the priest and teacher. Who differentiate, who
qualify and complicate, who make mean unnecessary elaborations,
and so divide mankind. If it were not for the weakness and
wickedness of the priests, every one would know and understand
God. Every one who was modest enough not to set up for particular
knowledge. Men disputed whether God is Finite or Infinite,
whether he has a triple or a single aspect. How should they know?
All we need to know is the face he turns to us. They impose their
horrible creeds and distinctions. None of those things matter.
Call him Christ the God or call him simply God, Allah, Heaven; it
does not matter. He comes to us, we know, like a Helper and
Friend; that is all we want to know. You may speculate further if
you like, but it is not religion. They dispute whether he can set
aside nature. But that is superstition. He is either master of
nature and he knows that it is good, or he is part of nature and
must obey. That is an argument for hair-splitting metaphysicians.
Either answer means the same for us. It does not matter which way
we come to believe that he does not idly set the course of things
aside. Obviously he does not set the course of things aside. What
he does do for certain is to give us courage and save us from our
selfishness and the bitter hell it makes for us. And every one
knows too what sort of things we want, and for what end we want
to escape from ourselves. We want to do right. And right, if you
think clearly, is just truth within and service without, the
service of God's kingdom, which is mankind, the service of human
needs and the increase of human power and experience. It is all
perfectly plain, it is all quite easy for any one to understand,
who isn't misled and chattered at and threatened and poisoned by
evil priests and teachers."
<P>
"And you are going to preach that, Daddy?"
<P>
"If I can. When I am free--you know I have still to resign
and give up--I shall make that my message."
<P>
"And so God comes."
<P>
"God comes as men perceive him in his simplicity.... Let men
but see God simply, and forthwith God and his kingdom possess the
world."
<P>
She looked out to sea in silence for awhile.
<P>
Then she turned to her father. "And you think that His Kingdom
will come--perhaps in quite a little time--perhaps in our
lifetimes? And that all these ridiculous or wicked little kings
and emperors, and these political parties, and these policies and
conspiracies, and this nationalist nonsense and all the
patriotism and rowdyism, all the private profit-seeking and every
baseness in life, all the things that it is so horrible and
disgusting to be young among and powerless among, you think they
will fade before him?"
<P>
The bishop pulled his faith together.
<P>
"They will fade before him--but whether it will take a
lifetime or a hundred lifetimes or a thousand lifetimes, my Norah
--"
<P>
He smiled and left his sentence unfinished, and she smiled back
at him to show she understood.
<P>
And then he confessed further, because he did not want to seem
merely sentimentally hopeful.
<P>
"When I was in the cathedral, Norah--and just before that
service, it seemed to me--it was very real.... It seemed that
perhaps the Kingdom of God is nearer than we suppose, that it
needs but the faith and courage of a few, and it may be that we
may even live to see the dawning of his kingdom, even--who
knows?--the sunrise. I am so full of faith and hope that I fear
to be hopeful with you. But whether it is near or far--"
<P>
"We work for it," said Eleanor.
<P>
Eleanor thought, eyes downcast for a little while, and then
looked up.
<P>
"It is so wonderful to talk to you like this, Daddy. In the old
days, I didn't dream--Before I went to Newnham. I misjudged
you. I thought Never mind what I thought. It was silly. But now I
am so proud of you. And so happy to be back with you, Daddy, and
find that your religion is after all just the same religion that
I have been wanting."
