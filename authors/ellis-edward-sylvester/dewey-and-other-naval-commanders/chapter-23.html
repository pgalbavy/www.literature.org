<p>A New Era for the United States Navy &mdash;Opening of the Great
Civil War&mdash;John Lorimer Worden &mdash;Battle Between the <em>Monitor</em>
and <em>Merrimac</em> &mdash;Death of Worden.</p>

<p>The War for the Union ushered in a new era for the American navy.
Steam navigation had been fully established some years before.
As all my readers no doubt know, the first successful steamboat
in this country was the <em>Clermont</em>, made by Robert Fulton,
which ascended the Hudson in the summer of 1807. The average speed
of the pioneer boat was about five miles an hour, so that the
trip occupied more than thirty hours. This great invention was
a novelty, and, like many others of a similar nature, it required
considerable time for it to come into use. The first western steamboat
was built at Pittsburg in 1811. It gave an impetus to river navigation
by steam, and before long the boats were ploughing the principal
streams of the country. The first steamer to cross the Atlantic
was the <em>Savannah</em>, which made the voyage in 1819, but
ocean navigation was not fairly begun until 1838, when the <em>Sirius</em>
and <em>Great Western</em> made the voyage from England to the
United States. It is a noteworthy fact that one of the greatest
of English scientists, after demonstrating that ocean navigation
by steam was impossible, was a passenger on the <em>Great Western</em>
on her first trip across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>When the great Civil War burst upon the country the National
Government not only failed to comprehend the gigantic nature of
the struggle, but was almost wholly unprepared for it. The navy
consisted of 90 vessels, of which only 42 were in commission,
while 21 were unfit for service, and of those in commission there
were but 11, carrying 134 guns, that were in American waters.
The remainder were scattered over the waters of the globe, such
being the policy of President Buchanan's Secretary of the Navy,
who, like the Secretary of War and other members of the Presidential
Cabinet, were secessionists who did all they could to pave the
way for the establishment of the Southern Confederacy.</p>

<p>On the authority of Maclay, the total number of officers of all
grades in the navy on August 1, 1861, was 1,457, in addition to
whom an immense volunteer force was called for and 7,500 volunteer
officers were enrolled before the close of the war. Three hundred
and twenty-two officers resigned from the United States navy and
entered that of the seceding States, of which 243 were officers
of the line. The 7,600 sailors in the navy at the opening of the
war was increased to 51,500 before the close of hostilities.</p>

<p>In a work of this nature the difficulty is to select the most
striking and interesting incidents from the scores that formed
a part of the War for the Union. One of the many heroes who was
brought into prominence was John Lorimer Worden, who was born
in Dutchess County, <em>N.Y., </em>March 12, 1818. He entered
the navy when sixteen years old and became a lieutenant in 1840.
His services in the Mexican War were unimportant and he was a
first lieutenant of the Brooklyn Navy Yard when the Civil War
broke out.</p>

<p>In the month of April, 1861, when a conflict was inevitable,
the Government was anxious to send dispatches to Captain Adams
commanding the fleet at Pensacola, who was waiting for orders
to reinforce with two companies of artillery, that post being
in danger of capture by the Confederates. The dispatches intrusted
to Lieutenant Worden were orders for such reinforcements to be
made.</p>

<p>It was so delicate and dangerous a duty, since Worden was compelled
to make his way through the South which was aflame with secession
excitement, that he committed the dispatches to memory and then
destroyed them. He applied to General Bragg in command of the
Confederate forces in that neighborhood for permission to make
a verbal communication from the Secretary of War to Captain Adams.
Permission was given, and, going on board, Worden delivered his
message like a boy reciting his piece at school. Captain Adams
gave him a written acknowledgment of the receipt of the dispatches,
adding that the orders of the Government would be carried out.</p>

<p>Having thus cleverly eluded the suspicious watchfulness of the
authorities, Lieutenant Worden started for home, but when near
Montgomery, Ala., then the capital of the Confederacy, he was
arrested, taken from the train and thrown into prison. This was
on the order of General Bragg, who discovered how he had been
outwitted, and the prompt reinforcement prevented the capture
of Fort Pickens, for which Bragg had made every preparation. The
post was held by the Unionists throughout the war and was the
only one south of Mason and Dixon's line so held.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Worden was kept a prisoner until the 13th of the following
November, when, his health having broken down, he was exchanged
and sent North. There he remained, slowly regaining his strength
until March, 1862, when it fell to his lot to become a leading
actor in one of the most famous naval engagements in all history.</p>

<p>When war had fully begun the Union forces in charge of the Norfolk
Navy Yard saw they were not strong enough to prevent its capture
by the Confederates, who were arming for that purpose. They therefore
set fire to the numerous and valuable shipping there. Among the
vessels scuttled and sunk was the steam frigate <em>Merrimac</em>,
at that time the finest vessel in the service. In truth, she went
down so quickly that very little damage was done to her. The Confederates
raised her, fastened a huge iron snout or prow at the front, cut
down her deck and encased her with railroad iron, which sloped
at an angle of forty-five degrees, and was smeared on the outside
with grease and tallow. Her enormous weight made her draw more
than twenty feet of water and when she was moving slowly through
the bay or river her appearance suggested the mansard roof of
a vast house. From what has been said it will be noted that the
<em>Merrimac</em> was a genuine ironclad, something which had
never been heard of before.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>BLOCKADE RUNNER&mdash;THE "MONITOR" &</em>mdash;<em>CAPTAIN
ERICSSON</em>.]</p>

<p>Regular news of the building of the <em>Merrimac</em> (called
the <em>Virginia</em> by the Confederates) was telegraphed to
Washington by friends of the Government. The authorities felt
some uneasiness, but were far from suspecting the terrible power
for destructiveness possessed by the monster. Captain Ericsson,
the famous Swedish inventor, was constructing on Long Island an
ironclad about one-fourth the size of the <em>Merrimac</em>, and
he was urged to all possible speed in its completion. He kept
his men busy night and day and had it finished a day or two before
the completion of the <em>Merrimac</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Merrimac</em> carried ten guns, which fired shells and
had a crew of 300 men, under the command of Commodore Franklin
Buchanan, a former officer of the United States navy. Late in
the forenoon of March 8, 1862, a column of black smoke rising
over the Norfolk Navy Yard gave notice that the <em>Merrimac</em>
had started out at last on her mission of destruction and death.
As the enormous craft forged into sight it was seen that she was
accompanied by three gunboats ready to give what help they could.</p>

<p>Five Union vessels were awaiting her in Hampton Roads. They were
the steam frigates <em>Minnesota</em> and <em>Roanoke</em> and
the sailing frigates <em>Congress</em>, <em>Cumberland</em> and
<em>St. Lawrence</em>, all of which immediately cleared for action.
Turning her frightful front toward the <em>Cumberland</em>, the
<em>Merrimac</em> swept down upon her in grim and awful majesty.
The <em>Cumberland</em> let fly with her terrific broadsides,
which were powerful enough to sink the largest ship afloat, but
the tons of metal hurled with inconceivable force skipped off
the greased sides of the iron roof and scooted away for hundreds
of yards through the startled air.</p>

<p>The prodigious broadsides were launched again and again, but
produced no more effect than so many paper wads from a popgun.
The iron prow of the <em>Merrimac</em> crashed through the wooden
walls of the <em>Cumberland</em> as if they were cardboard, and,
while her crew were still heroically working their guns, the <em>Cumberland</em>
went down, with the red flag, meaning "no surrender," flying from
her peak. Lieutenant Morris succeeded in saving himself, but 121
were lost out of the crew of 376.</p>

<p>Having destroyed the <em>Cumberland</em>, the <em>Merrimac</em>
now made for the <em>Congress</em>, which had been vainly pelting
her with her broadsides. The <em>Congress</em> was aground and
so completely at the mercy of the <em>Merrimac</em>, which raked
her fore and aft, that every man would have been killed had not
the sign of surrender been displayed. As it was, her commander
and 100 of the crew were slain by the irresistible fire of the
tremendous ironclad.</p>

<p>By this time the fearful spring afternoon was drawing to a close
and the <em>Merrimac</em> labored heavily back to Sewall's Point,
intending to return on the morrow and continue her work of destruction.</p>

<p>The news of what the <em>Merrimac</em> had done was telegraphed
throughout the South and North. In the former it caused wild rejoicing
and raised hope that before the resistless might of the new ironclad
the North would be compelled to make terms and save her leading
seacoast cities from annihilation by acknowledging the Southern
Confederacy. The national authorities were thrown into consternation.
At a special meeting of the President's Cabinet Secretary of War
Stanton expressed his belief that the <em>Merrimac</em> would
appear in front of Washington and compel the authorities to choose
between surrender and destruction, and that the principal seaports
would be laid under contribution.</p>

<p>But at that very time the hastily completed <em>Monitor</em>
was speeding southward under the command of Lieutenant Worden,
who had risen from a sick bed to assume the duty which no one
else was willing to undertake. Her crew numbered 16 officers and
42 men, with Lieutenant S. Dana Green as executive officer. Her
voyage to Hampton Roads was difficult and of the most trying nature
to the officers and crew, who were nearly smothered by gas. The
boat would have foundered had not the weather been unusually favorable,
but she reached Hampton Roads on the night of March 8 and took
a position beside the <em>Minnesota</em>, ready and eager for
the terrific fray of the morrow. The <em>Monitor</em> carried
two 11-inch Dahlgren guns and fired solid shot.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE "MERRIMAC" AND "MONITOR</em>."]</p>

<p>When the <em>Merrimac</em> steamed back the <em>Monitor</em>
moved out from her position and boldly advanced to meet her. The
huge monster and smaller craft, whose appearance suggested the
apt comparison of a cheese box on a raft, silently drew near each
other until within a hundred yards, when the smaller opened with
a shot to which the larger replied. The battle was now between
two ironclads. If the shots of the <em>Monitor</em> glanced harmlessly
off of the <em>Merrimac</em> those of the latter were equally
ineffective against the <em>Monitor</em>. The latter had the advantage
of being so much smaller that many of the shells of the <em>Merrimac</em>
missed her altogether. Those which impinged against the pilot
house or turret did no harm, while the lesser boat was able to
dart here and there at will, dodging the <em>Merrimac</em> and
ramming her when she chose, though such tactics accomplished nothing.
All attempts to run down the <em>Monitor</em> were vain. The novel
battle continued for four hours, when the <em>Merrimac</em>, unable
to defeat her nimble antagonist, steamed back to Norfolk and the
strange contest&mdash;the first between ironclads&mdash;was over.</p>

<p>The <em>Monitor</em> had proven her inestimable value and was
held in reserve by the Government for future emergencies. But
the first battle between the two proved the last. Some months
later, when the Union troops advanced upon Norfolk, the <em>Merrimac</em>
was blown up to prevent her falling into the hands of the Federals,
while at the close of the year the <em>Monitor</em> foundered
in a gale off Cape Hatteras.</p>

<p>This fight marked an era in the history of naval warfare. The
days of wooden vessels were numbered. All nations saw that their
warships to be effective must be ironclad, and the reader does
not need to be reminded that such is the fact to-day respecting
the navy of every civilized nation.</p>

<p>During this memorable fight a shell from the <em>Merrimac</em>
lifted the iron plate of the pilot house of the <em>Monitor</em>
and disabled Lieutenant Worden by driving the fragments into his
face, while he was peering out of the peep-hole. He was compelled
to give way to Lieutenant Green, who handled the little ironclad
throughout the remainder of the fight.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Worden never fully recovered from the injuries received
in his fight with the <em>Merrimac</em>. As soon as he was able
to take an active command he asked the privilege of doing so.
In charge of the <em>Montauk</em>, of the South Atlantic blockading
squadron, he destroyed, while under a heavy fire, the Confederate
steamer <em>Nashville</em> and participated in the unsuccessful
attack upon Charleston. He received the thanks of Congress and
was promoted to be a commander for his services with the <em>Monitor</em>.
From 1870 to 1874 he was superintendent of the Naval Academy at
Annapolis, becoming commodore in 1868, rear admiral in 1872 and
was retired in 1886. It was said that he never was without pain
from the injuries received in the battle with the <em>Merrimac</em>
until his death, October 18, 1897.</p>
