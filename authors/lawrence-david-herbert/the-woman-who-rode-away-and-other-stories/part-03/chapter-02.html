<p>She had had the child so much on her mind, in a torment of
responsibility, as if, having borne him, she had to answer for his
whole existence.  Even if his nose were running, it had been
repulsive and a goad in her vitals, as if she must say to herself:
Look at the thing you brought forth!</p>

<p>Now a change took place.  She was no longer vitally consumed about
the child, she took the strain of her anxiety and her will from off
him.  And he thrived all the more for it.</p>

<p>She was thinking inside herself, of the sun in his splendour, and
his entering into her.  Her life was now a secret ritual.  She
always lay awake, before dawn, watching for the grey to colour to
pale gold, to know if clouds lay on the sea's edge.  Her joy was
when he rose all molten in his nakedness, and threw off blue-white
fire, into the tender heaven.</p>

<p>But sometimes he came ruddy, like a big, shy creature.  And
sometimes slow and crimson red, with a look of anger, slowly
pushing and shouldering.  Sometimes again she could not see him,
only the level cloud threw down gold and scarlet from above, as he
moved behind the wall.</p>

<p>She was fortunate.  Weeks went by, and though the dawn was
sometimes clouded, and afternoon was sometimes grey, never a day
passed sunless, and most days, winter though it was, streamed
radiant.  The thin little wild crocuses came up mauve and striped,
the wild narcissus hung their winter stars.</p>

<p>Every day, she went down to the cypress tree, among the cactus
grove on the knoll with yellowish cliffs at the foot.  She was
wiser and subtler now, wearing only a dove-grey wrapper, and
sandals.  So that in an instant, in any hidden niche, she was naked
to the sun.  And the moment she was covered again she was grey and
invisible.</p>

<p>Every day, in the morning towards noon, she lay at the foot of the
powerful, silver-pawed cypress tree, while the sun strode jovial in
heaven.  By now she knew the sun in every thread of her body.  Her
heart of anxiety, that anxious, straining heart, had disappeared
altogether, like a flower that falls in the sun, and leaves only a
little ripening fruit.  And her tense womb, though still closed,
was slowly unfolding, slowly, slowly, like a lily bud under water,
as the sun mysteriously touched it.  Like a lily bud under water it
was slowly rising to the sun, to expand at last, to the sun, only
to the sun.</p>

<p>She knew the sun in all her body, the blue-molten with his white
fire edges, throwing off fire.  And, though he shone on all the
world, when she lay unclothed he focussed on her.  It was one of
the wonders of the sun, he could shine on a million people, and
still be the radiant, splendid, unique sun, focussed on her alone.</p>

<p>With her knowledge of the sun, and her conviction that the sun was
gradually penetrating her to know her, in the cosmic carnal sense
of the word, came over her a feeling of a detachment from people,
and a certain contemptuous tolerance for human beings altogether.
They were so un-elemental, so un-sunned.  They were so like
graveyard worms.</p>

<p>Even the peasants passing up the rocky, ancient little road with
their donkeys, sun-blackened as they were, were not sunned right
through.  There was a little soft white core of fear, like a snail
in a shell, where the soul of the man cowered in fear of the
natural blaze of life.  He dared not quite see the sun: always
innerly cowed.  All men were like that.</p>

<p>Why admit men!</p>

<p>With her indifference to people, to men, she was not now so
cautious about being seen.  She had told Marinina, who went
shopping for her in the village, that the doctor had ordered sun-
baths.  Let that suffice.</p>

<p>Marinina was a woman of sixty or more, tall, thin, erect, with
curling dark-grey hair, and dark-grey eyes that had the shrewdness
of thousands of years in them, with the laugh, half mockery, that
underlies all long experience.  Tragedy is lack of experience.</p>

<p>&quot;It must be beautiful to go naked in the sun,&quot; said Marinina, with
a shrewd laugh in her eyes as she looked keenly at the other woman.
Juliet's fair, bobbed hair curled in a little cloud at her temples.
Marinina was a woman of Magna Graecia, and had far memories.  She
looked again at Juliet.</p>

<p>&quot;But when a woman is beautiful, she can show herself to the sun?
eh? isn't it true?&quot; she added, with that queer, breathless little
laugh of the women of the past.</p>

<p>&quot;Who knows if I am beautiful!&quot; said Juliet.</p>

<p>But beautiful or not, she felt that by the sun she was appreciated.
Which is the same.</p>

<p>When, out of the sun at noon, sometimes she stole down over the
rocks and past the cliff-edge, down to the deep gully where the
lemons hung in cool eternal shadow; and in the silence slipped off
her wrapper to wash herself quickly at one of the deep, clear green
basins, she would notice, in the bare green twilight under the
lemon leaves, that all her body was rosy, rosy, and turning to
gold.  She was like another person.  She was another person.</p>

<p>So she remembered that the Greeks had said a white unsunned body
was unhealthy, and fishy.</p>

<p>And she would rub a little olive oil into her skin, and wander a
moment in the dark underworld of the lemons, balancing a lemon-
flower in her navel, laughing to herself.  There was just a chance
some peasant might see her.  But if he did, he would be more afraid
of her than she of him.  She knew of the white core of fear in the
clothed bodies of men.</p>

<p>She knew it even in her little son.  How he mistrusted her, now
that she laughed at him, with the sun in her face!  She insisted on
his toddling naked in the sunshine, every day.  And now his little
body was pink too, his blond hair was pushed thick from his brow,
his cheeks had a pomegranate scarlet, in the delicate gold of the
sunny skin.  He was bonny and healthy, and the servants, loving his
gold and red and blue, called him an angel from heaven.</p>

<p>But he mistrusted his mother: she laughed at him.  And she saw, in
his wide blue eyes, under the little frown, that centre of fear,
misgiving, which she believed was at the centre of all male eyes,
now.  She called it fear of the sun.  And her womb stayed shut
against all men, sun-fearers.</p>

<p>&quot;He fears the sun,&quot; she would say to herself, looking down into the
eyes of the child.</p>

<p>And as she watched him toddling, swaying, tumbling in the sunshine,
making his little bird-like noises, she saw that he held himself
tight and hidden from the sun, inside himself, and his balance was
clumsy, his movements a little gross.  His spirit was like a snail
in a shell, in a damp, cold crevice inside himself.  It made her
think of his father.  And she wished she could make him come forth,
break out in a gesture of recklessness, a salutation to the sun.</p>

<p>She determined to take him with her, down to the cypress tree among
the cactus.  She would have to watch him, because of the thorns.
But surely in that place he would come forth from the little shell,
deep inside him.  That little civilised tension would disappear off
his brow.</p>

<p>She spread a rug for him and sat down.  Then she slid off her
wrapper and lay down herself, watching a hawk high in the blue, and
the tip of the cypress hanging over.</p>

<p>The boy played with stones on the rug.  When he got up to toddle
away, she got up too.  He turned and looked at her.  Almost, from
his blue eyes, it was the challenging, warm look of the true male.
And he was handsome, with the scarlet in the golden blond of his
skin.  He was not really white.  His skin was gold-dusky.</p>

<p>&quot;Mind the thorns, darling,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Thorns!&quot; re-echoed the child, in a birdy chirp, still looking at
her over his shoulder, like some naked putto in a picture,
doubtful.</p>

<p>&quot;Nasty prickly thorns.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ickly thorns!&quot;</p>

<p>He staggered in his little sandals over the stones, pulling at the
dry mint.  She was quick as a serpent, leaping to him, when he was
going to fall against the prickles.  It surprised even herself.
&quot;What a wild cat I am, really!&quot; she said to herself.</p>

<p>She brought him every day, when the sun shone, to the cypress tree.</p>

<p>&quot;Come!&quot; she said, &quot;Let us go to the cypress tree.&quot;</p>

<p>And if there was a cloudy day, with the tramontana blowing, so that
she could not go down, the child would chirp incessantly:  &quot;Cypress
tree!  Cypress tree!&quot;</p>

<p>He missed it as much as she did.</p>

<p>It was not just taking sun-baths.  It was much more than that.
Something deep inside her unfolded and relaxed, and she was given
to a cosmic influence.  By some mysterious will inside her, deeper
than her known consciousness and her known will, she was put into
connection with the sun, and the stream of the sun flowed through
her, round her womb.  She herself, her conscious self, was
secondary, a secondary person, almost an onlooker.  The true Juliet
lived in the dark flow of the sun within her deep body, like a
river of dark rays circling, circling dark and violet round the
sweet, shut bud of her womb.</p>

<p>She had always been mistress of herself, aware of what she was
doing, and held tense in her own command.  Now she felt inside her
quite another sort of power, something greater than herself, darker
and more savage, the element flowing upon her.  Now she was vague,
in the spell of a power beyond herself.</p>
