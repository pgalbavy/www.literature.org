<p>It will be remembered that when Nick Ribsam left his companions,
early in the afternoon, it was with the resolution to find out
whether the showy shot made by Herbert Watrous at the buck, had
done the execution he claimed for it.</p>

<p>This forced him to make a much longer detour than did Sam Harper,
and, as he was obliged to move with great caution, he found no
time to sit down and rest or sleep.</p>

<p>The more he reflected on the exploit which Herbert attempted,
the more did he doubt it.</p>

<p>"I suppose they hit a target a mile off, as Sam told me; but
that is when they know the exact distance. No person can hit a
deer a quarter of a mile away, unless he does it by chance. Herbert
proved he can't shoot anything close to him, and it isn't likely
he hit the deer by accident, for such accidents don't happen unless
it's a person that you don't want to hurt."</p>

<p>But he had started out to find the truth of the matter, and it
was in accordance with his disposition to do so, if it was possible.</p>

<p>Nick knew that if the buck which they had seen was anywhere in
the neighborhood, it was necessary to proceed with extreme caution
to avoid giving alarm. The wonder was that it had shown itself
after the fright caused by the dog.</p>

<p>The drowsy autumn afternoon was well advanced when the boy saw,
from his surroundings, that he was close to the spot where the
deer stood when Herbert fired at it with his long-range rifle.
There was the rock, but the animal was invisible.</p>

<p>Just beyond was an oak which had been upturned by some wrenching
tornado or storm. The roots protruded upward and from the sides,
the dirt still clinging to them, so that the bottom spread out
like a fan.</p>

<p>The base of the trunk lay flat on the ground, but the branching
limbs supported the top to that extent that it was raised five
or six feet from the earth. Consequently, it sloped away in an
incline from the crested summit to the base.</p>

<p>Such a sight is not unusual in any forest, for it is the general
fashion of trees to fall that way; but Nick was struck by the
evident fact that, although the oak was uprooted, as it is termed,
yet enough connection with the ground remained to afford nourishment,
and to keep life within it.</p>

<p>He started toward it, but had moved only a few steps when a slight
rustling in the undergrowth arrested his attention. Stopping short
he looked about him, and, with an amazement which can hardly be
imagined, saw the buck within fifty feet of him.</p>

<p>He was in a clump of undergrowth, and was browsing on some tender
shoots. His position was such that his side was toward Nick, who
first caught sight of his antlers above the bushes: and it was
a remarkable thing that he did not detect the approach of the
young hunter, despite the caution he used.</p>

<p>The sight was so unexpected that Nick was taken aback, and had
a spasm of that nervous affection which sometimes seizes the inexperienced
hunter, and is known as "buck fever."</p>

<p>Knowing that the game would bound away with the speed of the
wind the instant he scented danger, the lad brought up his rifle
and pointed at him.</p>

<p>Poor Nick shook as if he had a chill; it was impossible to control
his nerves; but, aiming as best he could, he fired. The deer was
"hit hard," though not so hard as young Ribsam meant and most
ardently desired.</p>

<p>Dropping the breech of his gun, Nick looked to see the result
of his shot, and found it amazing to a startling degree.</p>

<p>The buck, which was a noble fellow, stopped browsing, and, with
his head thrown high in air, looked around to learn where his
assailant was. Catching sight of the staring lad, the animal emitted
a furious sniff and charged upon him at full speed.</p>

<p>This is a most unusual thing for a deer to do, though many a
hunter has been killed by a wounded buck or moose, who has turned
upon and attacked him with the fury of a tiger.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "He turned on his heel and ran with might and
main for the fallen tree."]</p>

<p>Nick Ribsam thought it very singular, but he thought it very
alarming as well, and, without waiting to watch matters further,
he turned on his heel and ran with might and main for the fallen
tree.</p>

<p>The lusty youngster was a good runner, but the buck made three
times as much speed as he "went for him," with head lowered like
a charging bull.</p>

<p>Nick had to think fast, but fast as he thought he couldn't see
how the fallen oak was to offer him refuge against the fury of
the animal, and, unless it did so, he was in a bad predicament.</p>

<p>It was impossible to reach any tree in time to climb out of reach,
as Nellie did when pursued by the bear, and the highest portion
of the prostrate trunk would not protect him from the antlers
of the savage buck.</p>

<p>There was no use for the empty rifle as it seemed, and Nick was
on the point of throwing it away, when it occurred to him that
it might still serve as a weapon of defense.</p>

<p>"I will club it and see what can be done."</p>
