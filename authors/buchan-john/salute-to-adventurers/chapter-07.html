<p>I did not waste time in getting to work. I had already written
to my uncle, telling him my plans, and presently I received his
consent. I arranged that cargoes of such goods as I thought most
suitable for Virginian sales should arrive at regular seasons
independent of the tobacco harvest. Then I set about equipping
a store. On the high land north of James Town, by the road to
Middle Plantation, I bought some acres of cleared soil, and had
built for me a modest dwelling. Beside it stood a large brick
building, one half fitted as a tobacco shed, where the leaf could
lie for months, if need be, without taking harm, and the other
arranged as a merchant's store with roomy cellars and wide garrets.
I relinquished the warehouse by the James Town quay, and to my
joy I was able to relinquish Mr. Lambie. That timid soul had been
on thorns ever since I mooted my new projects. He implored me
to put them from me; he drew such pictures of the power of the
English traders, you would have thought them the prince merchants
of Venice; he saw all his hard-won gentility gone at a blow, and
himself an outcast precluded for ever from great men's recognition.
He could not bear it, and though he was loyal to my uncle's firm
in his own way, he sought a change. One day he announced that
he had been offered a post as steward to a big planter at Henricus,
and when I warmly bade him accept it, he smiled wanly, and said
he had done so a week agone. We parted very civilly, and I chose
as manager my servant, John Faulkner.</p>

<p>This is not a history of my trading ventures, or I would tell
at length the steps I took to found a new way of business. I went
among the planters, offering to buy tobacco from the coming harvest,
and to pay for it in bonds which could be exchanged for goods
at my store. I also offered to provide shipment in the autumn
for tobacco and other wares, and I fixed the charge for freight&mdash;a
very moderate one&mdash;in advance. My plan was to clear out my store
before the return of the ships, and to have thereby a large quantity
of tobacco mortgaged to me. I hoped that thus I would win the
friendship and custom of the planters, since I offered them a
more convenient way of sale and higher profits. I hoped by breaking
down the English monopoly to induce a continual and wholesome
commerce in the land. For this purpose it was necessary to get
coin into the people's hands, so, using my uncle's credit, I had
a parcel of English money from the New York goldsmiths.</p>

<p>In a week I found myself the most-talked-of man in the dominion,
and soon I saw the troubles that credit brings. I had picked up
a very correct notion of the fortunes of most of the planters,
and the men who were most eager to sell to me were just those
I could least trust. Some fellow who was near bankrupt from dice
and cock-fighting would offer me five hundred hogsheads, when
I knew that his ill-guided estate could scarce produce half. I
was not a merchant out of charity, and I had to decline many offers,
and so made many foes. Still, one way and another, I was not long
in clearing out my store, and I found myself with some three times
the amount of tobacco in prospect that I had sent home at the
last harvest.</p>

<p>That was very well, but there was the devil to pay besides. Every
wastrel I sent off empty-handed was my enemy; the agents of the
Englishmen looked sourly at me; and many a man who was swindled
grossly by the Bristol buyers saw me as a marauder instead of
a benefactor. For this I was prepared; but what staggered me was
the way that some of the better sort of the gentry came to regard
me. It was not that they did not give me their custom; that I
did not expect, for gunpowder alone would change the habits of
a Virginian Tory. But my new business seemed to them such a downcome
that they passed me by with a cock of the chin. Before they had
treated me hospitably, and made me welcome at their houses. I
had hunted the fox with them&mdash;very little to my credit; and shot
wildfowl in their company with better success. I had dined with
them, and danced in their halls at Christmas. Then I had been
a gentleman; now I was a shopkeeper, a creature about the level
of a redemptioner. The thing was so childish that it made me angry.
It was right for one of them to sell his tobacco on his own wharf
to a tarry skipper who cheated him grossly, but wrong for me to
sell kebbucks and linsey-woolsey at an even bargain. I gave up
the puzzle. Some folks' notions of gentility are beyond my wits.</p>

<p>I had taken to going to the church in James Town, first at Mr.
Lambie's desire, and then because I liked the sermons. There on
a Sunday you would see the fashion of the neighbourhood, for the
planters' ladies rode in on pillions, and the planters themselves,
in gold-embroidered waistcoats and plush breeches and new-powdered
wigs, leaned on the tombstones, and exchanged snuffmulls and gossip.
In the old ramshackle graveyard you would see such a parade of
satin bodices and tabby petticoats and lace headgear as made it
blossom like the rose. I went to church one Sunday in my second
summer, and, being late, went up the aisle looking for a place.
The men at the seat-ends would not stir to accommodate me, and
I had to find rest in the cock-loft. I thought nothing of it,
but the close of the service was to enlighten me. As I went down
the churchyard not a man or woman gave me greeting, and when I
spoke to any I was not answered. These were men with whom I had
been on the friendliest terms; women, too, who only a week before
had chaffered with me at the store. It was clear that the little
society had marooned me to an isle by myself. I was a leper, unfit
for gentlefolks' company, because, forsooth, I had sold goods,
which every one of them did also, and had tried to sell them fair.</p>

<p>The thing made me very bitter. I sat in my house during the hot
noons when no one stirred, and black anger filled my heart. I
grew as peevish as a slighted girl, and would no doubt have fretted
myself into some signal folly, had not an event occurred which
braced my soul again. This was the arrival of the English convoy.</p>

<p>When I heard that the ships were sighted, I made certain of trouble.
I had meantime added to my staff two other young men, who, like
Faulkner, lived with me at the store. Also I had got four stalwart
negro slaves who slept in a hut in my garden. 'Twas a strong enough
force to repel a drunken posse from the plantations, and I had
a fancy that it would be needed in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Two days later, going down the street of James Town, I met one
of the English skippers, a redfaced, bottle-nosed old ruffian
called Bullivant. He was full of apple-jack, and strutted across
the way to accost me.</p>

<p>"What's this I hear, Sawney?" he cried. "You're setting up as
a pedlar, and trying to cut in on our trade. Od twist me, but
we'll put an end to that, my bully-boy. D'you think the King,
God bless him, made the laws for a red-haired, flea-bitten Sawney
to diddle true-born Englishmen? What'll the King's Bench say to
that, think ye?"</p>

<p>He was very abusive, but very uncertain on his legs. I said good-humouredly
that I welcomed process of law, and would defend my action. He
shook his head, and said something about law not being everything,
and England being a long road off. He had clearly some great threat
to be delivered of, but just then he sat down so heavily that
he had no breath for anything but curses.</p>

<p>But the drunkard had given me a notion. I hurried home and gave
instructions to my men to keep a special guard on the store. Then
I set off in a pinnace to find my three ships, which were now
lading up and down among the creeks.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of a fortnight's struggle, when every
man's hand was against me, and I enjoyed myself surprisingly.
I was never at rest by land or water. The ships were the least
of the business, for the dour Scots seamen were a match for all
comers. I made them anchor at twilight in mid-stream for safety's
sake, for in that drouthy clime a firebrand might play havoc with
them. The worst that happened was that one moonless night a band
of rascals, rigged out as Indian braves, came yelling down to
the quay where some tobacco was waiting to be shipped, and before
my men were warned had tipped a couple of hogsheads into the water.
They got no further, for we fell upon them with marling-spikes
and hatchets, stripped them of their feathers, and sent them to
cool their heads in the muddy river. The ring-leader I haled to
James Town, and had the pleasure of seeing him grinning through
a collar in the common stocks.</p>

<p>Then I hied me back to my store, which was my worst anxiety,
I was followed by ill names as I went down the street, and one
day in a tavern, a young fool drew his shabble on me. But I would
quarrel with no man, for that was a luxury beyond a trader. There
had been an attack on my tobacco shed by some of the English seamen,
and in the mellay one of my blacks got an ugly wound from a cutlass.
It was only a foretaste, and I set my house in order.</p>

<p>One afternoon John Faulkner brought me word that mischief would
be afoot at the darkening. I put each man to his station, and
I had the sense to picket them a little distance from the house.
The Englishmen were clumsy conspirators. We watched them arrive,
let them pass, and followed silently on their heels. Their business
was wreckage, and they fixed a charge of powder by the tobacco
shed, laid and lit a fuse, and retired discreetly into the bushes
to watch their handiwork.</p>

<p>Then we fell upon them, and the hindquarters of all bore witness
to our greeting.</p>

<p>I caught the fellow who had laid the fuse, tied the whole thing
round his neck, clapped a pistol to his ear, and marched him before
me into the town. "If you are minded to bolt," I said, "remember
you have a charge of gunpowder lobbing below your chin. I have
but to flash my pistol into it, and they will be picking the bits
of you off the high trees."</p>

<p>I took the rascal, his knees knocking under him, straight to
the ordinary where the English merchants chiefly forgathered.
A dozen of them sat over a bowl of punch, when the door was opened
and I kicked my Guy Fawkes inside. I may have misjudged them,
but I thought every eye looked furtive as they saw my prisoner.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said I, "I restore you your property. This is a
penitent thief who desires to make a confession."</p>

<p>My pistol was at his temple, the powder was round his neck, and
he must have seen a certain resolution in my face. Anyhow, sweating
and quaking, he blurted out his story, and when he offered to
halt I made rings with the barrel on the flesh of his neck.</p>

<p>"It is a damned lie," cried one of them, a handsome, over-dressed
fellow who had been conspicuous for his public insolence towards
me.</p>

<p>"Nay," said I, "our penitent's tale has the note of truth. One
word to you, gentlemen. I am hospitably inclined, and if any one
of you will so far honour me as to come himself instead of dispatching
his servant, his welcome will be the warmer. I bid you good-night
and leave you this fellow in proof of my goodwill. Keep him away
from the candle, I pray you, or you will all go to hell before
your time."</p>

<p>That was the end of my worst troubles, and presently my lading
was finished and my store replenished. Then came the time for
the return sailing, and the last enterprise of my friends was
to go off without my three vessels. But I got an order from the
Governor, delivered readily but with much profanity, to the commander
of the frigates to delay till the convoy was complete. I breathed
more freely as I saw the last hulls grow small in the estuary.
For now, as I reasoned it out, the planters must begin to compare
my prices with the Englishmen's, and must come to see where their
advantage lay.</p>

<p>But I had counted my chickens too soon, and was to be woefully
disappointed. At that time all the coast of America from New England
to the Main was infested by pirate vessels. Some sailed under
English letters of marque, and preyed only on the shipping of
France, with whom we were at war. Some who had formed themselves
into a company called the Brethren of the Coast robbed the Spanish
treasure-ships and merchantmen in the south waters, and rarely
came north to our parts save to careen or provision. They were
mostly English and Welsh, with a few Frenchmen, and though I had
little to say for their doings, they left British ships in the
main unmolested, and were welcomed as a godsend by our coast dwellers,
since they smuggled goods to them which would have been twice
the cost if bought at the convoy markets. Lastly, there were one
or two horrid desperadoes who ravaged the seas like tigers. Such
an one was the man Cosh, and that Teach, surnamed Blackbeard,
of whom we hear too much to-day. But, on the whole, we of Virginia
suffered not at all from these gentlemen of fortune, and piracy,
though the common peril of the seas, entered but little into the
estimation of the merchants.</p>

<p>Judge, then, of my disgust when I got news a week later that
one of my ships, the Ayr brig, had straggled from the convoy,
and been seized, rifled, and burned to the water by pirates almost
in sight of Cape Charles. The loss was grievous, but what angered
me was the mystery of such a happening. I knew the brig was a
slow sailer, but how in the name of honesty could she be suffered
in broad daylight to fall into such a fate? I remembered the hostility
of the Englishmen, and feared she had had foul play. Just after
Christmas-tide I expected two ships to replenish the stock in
my store. They arrived safe, but only by the skin of their teeth,
for both had been chased from their first entrance into American
waters, and only their big topsails and a favouring wind brought
them off. I examined the captains closely on the matter, and they
were positive that their assailant was not Cosh or any one of
his kidney, but a ship of the Brethren, who ordinarily were on
the best of terms with our merchantmen.</p>

<p>My suspicions now grew into a fever. I had long believed that
there was some connivance between the pirates of the coast and
the English traders, and small blame to them for it. 'Twas a sensible
way to avoid trouble, and I for one would rather pay a modest
blackmail every month or two than run the risk of losing a good
ship and a twelve-month's cargo. But when it came to using this
connivance for private spite, the thing was not to be endured.</p>

<p>In March my doubts became certainties. I had a parcel of gold
coin coming to me from New York in one of the coasting vessels&mdash;no
great sum, but more than I cared to lose. Presently I had news
that the ship was aground on a sandspit on Accomac, and had been
plundered by a pirate brigantine. I got a sloop and went down
the river, and, sure enough, I found the vessel newly refloated,
and the captain, an old New Hampshire fellow, in a great taking.
Piracy there had been, but of a queer kind, for not a farthing's
worth had been touched except my packet of gold. The skipper was
honesty itself, and it was plain that the pirate who had chased
the ship aground and then come aboard to plunder, had done it
to do me hurt, and me alone.</p>

<p>All this made me feel pretty solemn. My uncle was a rich man,
but no firm could afford these repeated losses. I was the most
unpopular figure in Virginia, hated by many, despised by the genteel,
whose only friends were my own servants and a few poverty-stricken
landward folk. I had found out a good way of trade, but I had
set a hornet's nest buzzing about my ears, and was on the fair
way to be extinguished. This alliance between my rivals and the
Free Companions was the last straw to my burden. If the sea was
to be shut to him, then a merchant might as well put up his shutters.</p>

<p>It made me solemn, but also most mightily angry. If the stars
in their courses were going to fight against Andrew Garvald, they
should find him ready. I went to the Governor, but he gave me
no comfort. Indeed, he laughed at me, and bade me try the same
weapon as my adversaries. I left him, very wrathful, and after
a night's sleep I began to see reason in his words. Clearly the
law of Virginia or of England would give me no redress. I was
an alien from the genteel world; why should I not get the benefit
of my ungentility? If my rivals went for their weapons into dark
places, I could surely do likewise. A line of Virgil came into
my head, which seemed to me to contain very good counsel: "<em>Flectere
si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo</em>", which means that if
you cannot get Heaven on your side, you had better try for the
Devil.</p>

<p>But how was I to get into touch with the Devil? And then I remembered
in a flash my meeting with the sea-captain on the Glasgow stairhead
and his promise to help me, I had no notion who he was or how
he could aid, but I had a vague memory of his power and briskness.
He had looked like the kind of lad who might conduct me into the
wild world of the Free Companions.</p>

<p>I sought Mercer's tavern by the water-side, a melancholy place
grown up with weeds, with a yard of dark trees at the back of
it. Old Mercer was an elder in the little wooden Presbyterian
kirk, which I had taken to attending since my quarrels with the
gentry. He knew me and greeted me with his doleful smile, shaking
his foolish old beard.</p>

<p>"What's your errand this e'en, Mr. Garvald?" he said in broad
Scots. "Will you drink a rummer o' toddy, or try some fine auld
usquebaugh I hae got frae my cousin in Buchan?"</p>

<p>I sat down on the settle outside the tavern door. "This is my
errand. I want you to bring me to a man or bring that man to me.
His name is Ninian Campbell."</p>

<p>Mercer looked at me dully.</p>

<p>"There was a lad o' that name was hanged at Inveraray i' '68
for stealin' twae hens and a wether."</p>

<p>"The man I mean is long and lean, and his head is as red as fire.
He gave me your name, so you must know him."</p>

<p>His eyes showed no recognition. He repeated the name to himself,
mumbling it toothlessly. "It sticks i' my memory," he said, "but
when and where I canna tell. Certes, there's no man o' the name
in Virginia."</p>

<p>I was beginning to think that my memory had played me false,
when suddenly the whole scene in the Saltmarket leaped vividly
to my brain. Then I remembered the something else I had been enjoined
to say.</p>

<p>"Ninian Campbell," I went on, "bade me ask for him here, and
I was to tell you that the lymphads are on the loch and the horn
of Diarmaid has sounded."</p>

<p>In a twinkling his face changed from vacancy to shrewdness and
from senility to purpose. He glanced uneasily round.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, speak soft," he whispered. "Come inside, man.
We'll steek the door, and then I'll hear your business."</p>
