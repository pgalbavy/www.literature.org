<p>Major Jack Starland decided to make his ambassadorial trip to
the Atlamalcan Republic by water instead of land, and to take
as his companion, Captain Guzman, though there would have seemed
to be slight choice between the two routes.</p>

<p>The Rio Rubio, flowing from the foot of the Andes, eastward to
the Atlantic, forks a few miles to the westward of Atlamalco,
the two branches reuniting twenty leagues to the eastward. The
island thus formed is twenty miles across the widest part, and
tapers to the east and west. As if nature aimed to provide for
two distinct communities, a precipitous mountain spur, which sprawls
several hundred miles north and south, ribs the territory almost
mathematically in the centre, and tumbles onward, broken and disjointed,
to the shores of the Caribbean Sea. The rumors that gold and diamonds
are awaiting garnering in the wild solitudes have roused the earth
hunger of more than one powerful nation, but the grim dragon that
crouches in the pulsing jungles, on whose forehead flames the
legend, "<em>MONROE DOCTRINE," </em>sends them scudding back across
the seas.</p>

<p>The western half of the island forms the Republic of Atlamalco,
whose President and Dictator is General Pedro Yozarro; the eastern
half constitutes Zalapata, with General Fernando de Bambos at
its head. The name "republic," as applied to the peppery provinces
has as much appropriateness as if given to Russia or China. The
respective population of the two republics is about the same,
and but for the whimsical, intense jealousy that is the most marked
peculiarity of South American countries, the two might grow rich,
prosperous and of considerable strength, for no region on the
globe is more favored in the way of climatic and natural resources.</p>

<p>Major Starland understood the delicate tensity of the relations
between Zalapata and Atlamalco. They had been at war before, with
the advantage at times on one side and then on the other, the
final result being no decisive change in their mutual strength
or in their combative propensities. The addition of a "gunboat"
to the power of Atlamalco naturally made her more aggressive and
demonstrative. President Bambos dreamed of acquiring two similar
engines of war, when he would proceed to wipe his hated rival
off the earth; but the loan which he tried to float remained inert
and the northern barbarians, whose shipyards send forth most of
the navies of the world, insisted upon cash or security as preliminary
to laying the keels of the Zalapatan fleet. The project therefore
hung fire. Though the craft that roamed up and down the bifurcated
river was referred to as a gunboat, it was simply an American
tug, some seventy-five feet in length, of the same tonnage and
with a single six-pounder mounted fore and another aft. From New
York it had sneaked southward, so far as possible, through the
inland passage to the Gulf of Mexico and then puffed across the
Caribbean and so on to the Rio Rubio and thence to its destination.</p>

<p>As intimated, Major Starland had the choice of two routes to
the western Republic: one by mule path or trail through the Rubio
Mountains, and the other by boat, fifty miles up the Rio Rubio:
he chose the latter.</p>

<p>On the morning following the council of war, he and his swarthy
friend, Captain Guzman, hoisted sail on their little catboat,
at the wharf of the capital, and catching the favoring breeze,
curved out into the stream, which was half a mile wide, and began
their voyage against a moderate current. Old campaigners like
them needed little luggage. The native officer took none at all,
while the Major's was in a small hand bag, which he had brought
from his yacht, twenty miles away at San Luis.</p>

<p>The American seated himself at the stern, where he controlled
the tiller, while the native lounged on the front seat smoking
his eternal cigarette. Behind them the pretty little capital,
with its five thousand inhabitants, distributed mostly in adobe
huts, shabby and of small dimensions, gradually sank out of sight,
and finally vanished behind a bend in the river. To the right,
stretched the immense undulating plain of exuberant forest, with
its tropical luxuriance, its smothering climate and its overwhelming
animal life. The banks on either hand were flat, and so low that
a continuous east wind often brought an overflow of the shores
for leagues inland. Here and there the bamboo or adobe hut of
a native peeped from the rank foliage, and the naked or half-dressed
occupants stared stupidly at the craft as it skimmed past. The
head of the family lolled on the bank, or in the shade beside
his home and smoked; the stolid wife slouched hither and thither
like an automaton, plodding at her work or perhaps scratching
the ground, that it might laugh a harvest, though oftener her
work lay in fighting off the prodigious growth which threatened
to strangle everybody and everything. She took her turn at smoking,
while the youngsters, most of them without a thread of clothing,
frolicked and tumbled in the simple delight of existence. But
all these were such common sights to the voyageurs that they gave
them no more than passing attention.</p>

<p>Captain Guzman was not a talkative man. He preferred to lounge,
to smoke, to fight, or to think. Major Starland had plenty of
thinking to do and little work. Having guided the craft out into
the middle of the stream, he rested the tiller between his elbow
and side and held the boat to its course, while he also lazily
puffed at his cigar. He glanced from side to side, like one who
was familiar with the scenery and he figured out that if the breeze
held, they would reach Atlamalco early on the morrow, for he did
not mean to continue the voyage after darkness had set in.</p>

<p>No one, however, can sail for a mile over the tropical waters
of South America without a striking experience with its myriad
animal life. The swarms of fish often clog the progress of vessels.
Numerous tiny thumps against the prow of the boat told of the
miniature collisions, and, looking over the side, the American
saw more fish than water. They varied in length from a few inches
to a couple of feet or more. Recognizing one vicious species,
he caught up a pole and thrust an end into the current. Instantly
fierce snaps followed, and when he drew out the dripping stick,
its extremity was gouged as if with dagger stabs.</p>

<p>"What little demons those caribs are!" he said, holding up the
pole for the Captain to see. The native nodded his head and silently
smoked on. Had either of them trailed his hand in the current
alongside the boat, a finger would have been nipped off in a flash
by those concentrated sharks.</p>

<p>There was a rush like that of the Atlamalcan tugboat and an immense
alligator surged up from the muddy depths, and kept pace with
the craft, as though tied to it. His piggish eyes surveyed the
two men as if meditating the crushing of the boat and its occupants
in one terrific crunch, like the hippopotamus of the Nile. He
partly opened and smacked his jaws, in anticipation, and slightly
increasing his speed, passed forward to the prow.</p>

<p>Finally Captain Guzman showed an interest in matters. Sitting
up, he drew his revolver from the belt around his waist, aimed
quickly and fired. The bullet darted into the nearer eye and ripped
through what little brain the saurian possessed. With a snort,
it whirled, darted several rods out into the stream, and then
spun round and round, as if caught in the vortex of a whirlpool.
Slight in one sense as was the wound, it was mortal and quickly
drew the attention of other alligators, who seemed to be projected
upward from the ooze of the river, and assailed their unfortunate
comrade with remorseless ferocity. In a twinkling he was torn
piecemeal by the cannibals, whose taste of blood set aflame their
rapacity. Had they known enough they might have smashed the boat
with their tails or rolled it over with their snouts; but, unaware
of their own strength, they kept up their wild darting to and
fro and were soon left behind.</p>
