<p>When you live in the city, or various cities, as I have done, you have
various things that distract your attention from the miracle that is
spreading all over the earth when the spring comes. Do such things
happen every spring, or is it just something that has unblinded my
eyes? Maybe I have really caught that rosy hue habit from Roxanne; but
the apple-trees this week have been almost too much for me. There are
great, gnarly, old apple-trees in every spare corner of Byrdsville,
where you wouldn't even expect a tree to be; and ever since I have
been in this town I have been finding a new one stretching out its
crooked old arms to me as if to welcome me or bar my path. There is
one that grows half in and half out of Judge Luttrell's yard, so the
fence has to consider it a kind of post and stop at it to begin again
on the other side, while three of them are trying to completely close
up the door of the court-house on the Public Square. All the streets
are bordered with them, set along at ragged intervals with the tall
old maples, and all the gardens and yards have regiments of them
camped about the doors and walks.
</p>
<p>Three nights ago I went to sleep in a nice orderly old town, and I
awoke the next morning in the middle of a great white and pink and
green bouquet, which must smell up at least to the first of the seven
heavens, and which is buzzing so with bees that it sounds like an
orchestra getting ready to burst out into some kind of a new, great
hymn. And everybody in Byrdsville is buzzing around in a chorus with
the bees, cleaning house and going visiting and shopping at the stores
down on the Square. I am as industriously doing likewise as I can, and
have bought things from almost everybody until my brain is feeble from
trying to think up things to ask for in the different stores. Oh, the
things I could buy if Roxanne would just let me!
</p><p>One trouble is, there are no really poor people in Byrdsville, and
those on the verge of it are taken care of by the different church
societies, which look after them so carefully that they come very near
stepping on each others' toes. The incident of old Mr. and Mrs.
Satterwhite came near being a case in point. Mr. Satterwhite has
always been a Presbyterian, and Mrs. Satterwhite disagreed with her
husband seriously enough to be a Methodist. They have no children and
have been getting poorer and poorer, though keeping both honest and
good, except for their religious differences. When the cold weather
came this winter, they had no coal to keep their respective
rheumatisms warm and they nearly froze to death arguing about which
one of their respective church societies they should ask help from;
and when they were both chattering cold they compromised on asking
both. Then they got two loads of coal, which was more than they
needed, and which offended both societies, so that when they asked for
some kindling to light the fire with, both societies said let the
other one send it. They had to sit up all night by turn for the rest
of the winter to keep the fire, for fear it would go out while they
were asleep.
</p><p>Roxanne and I were terribly distressed that such a hard thing as being
night watchman should happen to those old people, but the Idol said it
was just as well that one should sleep while the other watched, so
that they wouldn't have any mutual time to discuss religion. That was
a very practical view for a genius to take of the question and I was
surprised at him.
</p><p>And while the situation looks very bad for churches to get into, it
has been fortunate for me. I have been able to buy a lot of things at
all the stores for them, because I am an Episcopalian, and just one
girl can't be considered a church society. I'm the only one of my kind
in town. Roxanne has helped me and we have bought with discretion as
well as liberality, I think. After we had bought all the groceries
Uncle Pompey could suggest to us, and in quantities as large as would
go into all the corners of the kitchen of the Satterwhites' little
cottage, we began to make the house as beautiful as we thought those
good old people deserved, never having had anything beautiful in all
their lives before.
</p><p>First, we put the most expensive paper on all the walls, because we
found that the largest-flowered paper was what we needed, and it
happened to be a special kind that the paper man had to order by
telegram to be sent by express; for neither we, nor those old people
who are approaching the ends of their lives, could afford to wait. It
looked lovely when it was all on and it matched the velvet carpets,
which also had big flowers, good and gay.
</p><p>Of course, both Roxanne and I know better than to choose plush
furniture, but that was what Mrs. Satterwhite wanted, and they were
going to live in the cottage, not us. Father was pleased when I told
him what a big bill there would be at the furniture man's and said:
</p><p>"Good for you, Phil. I didn't think you could do so well as that."
</p><p>It took nearly two weeks of all our spare time, with Mamie Sue, when
she could escape Belle, helping and Tony occasionally, to get the
Satterwhites settled in their luxury; and then I decided to ask them
both seriously and separately if there was another desire of their
hearts left ungratified.
</p><p>"Well," said Mr. Satterwhite, as he stretched his feet in his new
velvet slippers that matched the carpet in that room, "I'd like a
nice, new Methody hymn-book to be put on the table for the old lady to
read outen on Sunday evenings."
</p><p>It was a glorious thing to think that Father's money, ill-gotten as it
is, could settle the church society quarrel; and I was so delighted
that I am afraid I showed excitement when I went into the kitchen to
ask Mrs. Satterwhite what she would like best now that the needs were
all satisfied.
</p><p>"Miss Phyllis, child, there is only one thing on earth I can think
of to want. I would like to have a year's subscription to the
<u>Presbyterian Observer</u> to read to Pa on Sunday nights, like I used
to when we was young and strong and working enough to afford the two
dollars." Remember, leather Louise, he is the Presbyterian and she is
the Methodist, so this was permanent reconciliation.
</p><p>My emotions are such that I can't write further about this incident,
but I wish I could picture Father's face when I told him about it,
'though still he wasn't satisfied and said spend some more. How could
I in a place where everybody had what they wanted and money is not
needed to make them enjoy life?
</p><p>My trouble was serious and I have had to confess to Roxanne about it.
</p><p>"I wish I could give all the girls and boys in the class a nice
present for some reason I haven't got," I said wistfully. "To Belle
especially, for she has been so pleasantly not unpleasant to me for
the last two weeks."
</p><p>"Yes, it is a pity, if you have to spend all that money in getting
other people what they want, that you can't get Belle's permanent
pleasantness. It is something that would do us all good," answered
Roxanne, with the sympathy that I always find in her.
</p><p>"Friendship that you have to buy would not be very valuable, generally
speaking," I answered, as I shook my brain for a plan. "But on the
other hand," I continued, "some people can see friendship in the form
of a present when they can't feel it from the heart. Belle is that
kind, and that is not my fault. What I want to find is a 'tie to bind
her'--speaking hymnally."
</p><p>"Yes, you are right, Phyllis," answered Roxanne thoughtfully, as she
and I both began to sew some little hand-made tucks that are to trim
the waist of the lovely blue muslin that Roxanne bought herself, to
our great joy. "I do wish we could think up something that would make
Belle understand how you appreciate her and--"
</p><p>But just here the Idol came and stood in the door with Lovelace Peyton
on his shoulder, whom he let slide down him to the floor. Now, a month
ago, I would rather have had anything happen to me than to sit in the
presence of Mr. Douglass Byrd, but all that reverential awe has
gone--changed, the awe gone and only reverence left. As we feared, he
has bought the new spring clothes, but we see no alarming signs of
affection toward Helena Kirby yet developed by them. How magnificent
he is in them, is beyond my pen to describe to you, Louise.
</p><p>"What has Miss Belle done that needs an expression of appreciation on
just this particular day of May?" he asked, with that delightful
interest he always shows in all of us--Roxanne's friends.
</p><p>And while it is trying in a way to girls whose dresses are still just
at their shoe tops to be called "Miss," we never resent it from him,
because it denotes real respect and not teasing like it does from some
of our friends and older relations. It is a very thin line that
separates ridicule from affectionate interest in girls of our age, but
he is always on the right side.
</p><p>"The reason Phyllis wants to do something nice for Belle is that she
has the kind of disposition that requires more to make her a friend
than the rest of us. It has to be something that will shock her into
seeing how fond of her Phyllis is." Roxanne's explanation was so well
expressed that the Idol saw the point and reason immediately.
</p><p>"You want to throw a kind of bombshell friendship into the camp of her
prejudices, Miss Phyllis," he said with his mouth twitching with a
laugh, as if he didn't know whether we would like it or not.
</p><p>"Yes, that is just what I want--an explosion, and I can't think of
anything but a gold bracelet or a ring, neither of which is a
skyrocket," I answered with the flow of wit that always comes in the
presence of the Idol, and which, I am sure, is just a reflection of
his genius.
</p><p>"I know a explode that I can git you, Phyllie," said Lovelace Peyton,
looking up from the bottle he was trying to get into his apron pocket,
his attention having been caught by the word that interested his
scientific mind.
</p><p>"Not the kind Miss Phyllis wants, bug-doctor," the Idol answered with
a laugh, as he filled his bag with tobacco that he keeps in a queer
old jar which the Douglass grandfathers brought from England before
the Revolution.
</p><p>"I <u>kin</u> git a 'splode that Phyllie wants," answered Lovelace
Peyton indignantly. "Phyllie always wants what I git her, even
squirms; don't you, Phyllie?"
</p><p>"Yes, I do," I answered quickly, for I can't even write how precious
to me is the way Lovelace Peyton treats me with confidence. He comes
to me now just as he goes to Roxanne for things he wants, strings or
sympathy, and I keep a supply of both on hand for him. And when he
brings dreadful bugs and things I never let my heart quake--that is,
so he will notice it. A woolly caterpillar was the last test that I
stood for him.
</p><p>"I think, however," said the Idol as he prepared to go on back to the
office, since he had only come up to the court-house on an errand
about something, "I think if I were you, Miss Phyllis, I would try a
quiet little gold bracelet. Believe me, it will work."
</p><p>You have to consider the source of advice like you do that of the
water you drink, and then act accordingly. If Mr. Douglass Byrd
advised me to buy one of my friends a gold bracelet, I ought not to
hesitate any longer than it takes to put on a hat and get my
pocketbook. Besides, I hadn't got a single thing from Mr. Snider, who
keeps the jewelry shop and the cigar stand at the same time in the
same shop. He was very cordial and glad to see Roxanne and me, and
tried to stretch out the attractiveness of his few jewels in a most
surprising way. He had two gold bracelets in stock, one plain and the
other with a red set in it that he thought was a ruby, but I knew it
to be a garnet. The plain one was really lovely, but I knew the other
would suit Belle better.
</p><p>When Roxanne tried on the plain one, her lovely dark eyes just
sparkled, and I could see how she loved it; but I had had my
experience with the Byrds' pride and I didn't even offer it to her. My
self-denial brought its reward. There were two little beauty pins just
alike with small pearls set along the bar. I bought them both. First,
I pinned one in the tie of my middy and then, with stern
determination, I handed one to Roxanne. She looked at me doubtfully,
then blushed and pinned hers in exactly the same spot on the collar of
her middy, which had been made to match mine since the temporary
easing of their financial strain. If she had defied me, I don't know
what I should have done, but I gave her a squeeze that was the most
graceful one I have ever accomplished since I have commenced to
practise demonstrations. No hero or ambassador ever felt so proud of a
decoration on his own chest as I did of that pin on Roxanne's. It is a
triumph for one person to be able to make friends despite another's
haughtiness and I felt that even the old portrait grandmother would
have been glad to have Roxanne make me so happy.
</p><p>Then I had an addition to my first plan. Ideas have a way of splitting
off and multiplying themselves like jellyfish do in the natural
history, if they are in favorable environment. I asked Mr. Snider to
set all the jewelry trays upon the counter again; and beginning at the
first one, I bought a nice token of my regard for all eleven of my
class at the Byrd Academy.
</p><p>"Now, Roxanne," I said as I left the store, "I know that this action
of mine looks very vulgarly rich, and if anybody did it to me I would
be as mad as Tony and all the rest will be if I offer them this
jewelry without an explanation. But Mr. Snider and the seven children
he has are enough to excuse any amount of vulgarity. Cigars and
jewelry are very little for that large family to thrive on, and that
was forty-five dollars I spent. I should think my friends would
sympathize with me in having to get rid of this money in a sensible
and charitable way, enough to take the tokens without any indignation
when I explain it to them. Don't you think so?
</p><p>"Oh, Phyllis," said Roxanne, with the affection in her voice that I
hope I am never going to get accustomed to, "nobody would refuse to do
just like you want them to; and if they thought they could, you would
make them see that it would be mean to do it. They will all be
delighted with the presents. Can't you see Mamie Sue turning that ring
around and around on her finger?"
</p><p>I had bought a ring with a lovely green set in it for Mamie Sue in
memory of the many horsehair ones she has had to wear to piece out her
memory, which must be fat and lazy like she is herself. I am going to
make my presentation apologies to them all tomorrow while we eat lunch
out on the flat rock in the academy yard. Sometimes we take a double
lunch and invite the boys to come over and share it with us. Roxanne
and I have planned to do this. She is going to let Uncle Pompey make
some one of his favorites for us. She is still indulging him in
cooking materials, but thinks she will have to begin to starve again
on June first. The new invention has got as far as needing some
chemicals already. But it is best to climb away from an evil day upon
the ever convenient rosy cloud and that is what we did as we walked
along toward home.
</p><p>But a strange thing happened, and funny, too. I'm blushing over my
awkwardness even as I write just to you, leather Louise. But isn't it
enough to make me blush to think of that scarf-pin, with the moonstone
and pearl in it, that I got to give Pink, sticking in the Idol's
necktie, if he hasn't already taken it off to go to bed? This is how it
happened. As we came along the street, almost as far as to Miss
Priscilla's, we met Tony and Mr. Douglass Byrd coming into town. I
never saw two people as much excited as they both were, and when they
saw us they stopped talking and looked at us like we were a surprise to
them. For a minute I was startled, for I thought I heard Mr. Roger's
name spoken excitedly by Tony; and I have never got over the uneasiness
about him, though the great secret robbery is a thing of two weeks
past. I can't help anxiously wondering what they were talking about.
They stopped, and so did we, and of course Tony's Scout eyes landed
right on those twin pins Roxanne and I were wearing; and before I could
stop her Roxanne had told him about the present-luncheon out on the
flat rock to-morrow, and Snider and how I <u>had</u> to spend money. I
thought Tony was going to laugh and joke about it, as his former
conduct would have been; but he got red in the face, shook as I put his
pin into the lapel of his coat and spoke to me as if I were ill and
needed sympathy, like he has been doing for a week. That was upsetting
enough; but when the Idol looked at me with real affection beaming from
his glorious eyes and said:
</p><p>"Don't I get a jewel, too, Miss Phyllis?" I almost doubled up into a
heap on the pavement, and it was Roxanne who came to my rescue and
held all of them out for him to take his choice. He took the one I
would rather have him take--a beautiful pearl, like my friendship is
for him, shadowed by the moonstone, which is my unworthiness.
</p><p>I'll go down early in the morning and get another pin for Pink. I wish
Father was here so I could tell him about Mr. Snider and how glad he
was to get the money. "Tainted money" were the words the magazine
used--wouldn't feeding hungry little children take the taint off the
money and the people who gave it? I believe so. I wish I had all
Father's money to give away and he had to work for all we get, at
something like being a lawyer or a doctor. This had been a lovely day,
and I'm thankful for my happiness. Good-night!
</p><hr/>
<p>Oh, why aren't people more careful about what they say before
children, who can't always understand all that things mean! I will
never forgive myself for bringing this awful thing down on Roxanne and
her family as long as I live, though Mr. Douglass Byrd says it was not
my fault at all. He was the one that called the present for Belle an
explosion, and so put the idea into Lovelace Peyton's mind. Nobody
knows yet just exactly what did happen or how bad his eyes are hurt,
but the light of all the world is going out for me if Lovelace Peyton
is going blind so he never can be the famous doctor he was born to be.
</p><p>Old Uncle Pompey has been gasping with asthma in the kitchen since
morning, and all he can tell is that Lovelace Peyton had taken some
kerosene out of the can on the back porch, be thought to just mix with
onions and other things he often uses to make medicines. Suddenly he
heard an explosion in the back yard and ran out to find Lovelace
Peyton's face all burned and him insensible. When Roxanne got to him
he just moaned that he was making an explosion for me, and then the
doctor gave him something to keep him from suffering with the burn
while he dressed it. They can't tell about the eyes as yet.
</p><p>[Illustration: He just moaned that he was making an explosion]
</p><p>Miss Prissy is with Roxanne, and they won't let me stay all night, so
I had to come home. Roxanne just won't believe that he won't get all
right, neither will Mr. Douglass Byrd. He was lovelier than ever to
me, but with that same kind of flavor in his kindness that he and Tony
both had yesterday. What can they be pitying me about?
</p><p>Father has been away a week and I am so sorry. I have just written to
him about the accident, and I know he will be distressed, for he was
as fond of Lovelace as of anybody he knew. I believe he'll come right
home.
</p><p>How can I go to sleep and wait until morning to know if those lovely,
blue, little-boy eyes will never look up at me again? What can I do to
ease this awful anxiety? As if I didn't know what to do when I have
heard so often about a Person who watches every sparrow's flight.
