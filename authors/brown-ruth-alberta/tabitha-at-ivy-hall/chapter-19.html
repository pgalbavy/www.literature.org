<p>The weeks vanished all too quickly to suit the black-eyed maid
from the desert, and she often found herself wondering where the
time went to, for before she realized it, winter had slipped away
and spring was nearly gone. Now May was half over, and in another
month school would be closed for the summer. Carrie was to spend
her vacation on the Oregon farm with her grandmother, and Tabitha
must return to the desert alone. She sat swinging idly under the
pepper trees, her Latin grammar on her knees, but with eyes staring
off across the smooth lawn and beautiful shrubbery, thinking mournfully
of the long, hot weeks on the burning desert before September
would come again.</p>

<p>"I have hardly had a chance to say a word to Carrie all this
year, and now after counting on three months alone with her in
Silver Bow, she is going away for her vacation. That is always
the way things happen with me. Some people have everything and
others nothing." Half unconsciously she began to hum the tune
Mrs. Vane had composed for <em>The Discontented Buttercup</em>;
then realizing what she was singing, she laughed.</p>

<p>"Now aren't you ashamed of yourself, Tabitha Catt?" she exclaimed
aloud. "When you have the chance to go to boarding school and
get an education, and make so many beautiful friendships and have
everything so perfectly lovely, here you are envying Carrie because
she is going to her grandmother's for vacation. She isn't well,
and it wouldn't be good for her to go back to the desert for the
hot summer months. Besides, you promised to be good and not to
envy people any more. You are a discontented buttercup.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
'Look bravely up into the sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be content with knowing<br/>
&nbsp;That God wished for a buttercup<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just here, where you are growing.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>"What's that about a buttercup?" asked a merry voice behind her,
so unexpectedly that Tabitha nearly fell out of the hammock. So
intent had she been upon her own thoughts that she had not heard
the tiptoeing footsteps on the soft grass, and was startled when
Carrie plumped down beside her, and three or four other girls
ranged themselves in comfortable positions in the fresh clover
at their feet.</p>

<p>"How you frightened me!" cried the absorbed songstress, moving
over to give Carrie more room. "Where have you been? You weren't
in your rooms when I came down, so I slipped out here to study."</p>

<p>"About buttercups?" teased Bertha, tickling her throat with a
long grass. "If you had gone up to the third floor you would have
found us all in Hattie's room, admiring the watch she just got
for her birthday. Have you seen it?"</p>

<p>"No, I was just finishing a letter when she called us, and by
the time I was ready to go, you had all disappeared. I forgot
she had changed her room."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Carrie abruptly, "here is a letter for you! We stopped
at your room as we came down and you weren't in, so I brought
it along. I got one from papa, too, and what do you think? There
has been a strike on the Tom Cat!"</p>

<p>A burst of laughter from the girls on the grass greeted this
remark, and even Tabitha joined in, though the unusual piece of
news made her heart beat fast and her eyes glow with an eagerness
she could not suppress.</p>

<p>"When&mdash;how big&mdash;" she began, but Cassandra interrupted with the
puzzled question, "What did they strike the tomcat for and who
did it?"</p>

<p>"The Tom Cat is the name of a claim Kitty's father owns, and
when there is a strike on a mining claim, it means that gold or
silver has been found," explained Carrie patiently. "Silver Bow
is a silver mining camp, but the Cat Group is about thirty miles
from there and it has gold on it. Papa says the vein they have
uncovered is very rich and promises to be a big one. They have
offered your father a fortune for just that one claim, but he
won't sell. He will be a rich man now, Puss. Aren't you glad?"</p>

<p>Tabitha sat in a daze, hardly daring to believe her ears. Could
it be after all these years her father was to find wealth again,
or was it all a dream?</p>

<p>"Well, you are the queerest girl!" declared Chrystobel, who was
watching her curiously. "If anyone had told me my father had found
a gold mine, I should jump up and down and shout, and then write
for some more money right away. You can have everything you want
now, can't you?"</p>

<p>Chrystobel had secretly pitied Tabitha because her monthly allowance
of pocket money was so small, and she did not understand how anyone
could receive the good news with such a calmly disinterested air.
But Tabitha was not disinterested in the least. She was simply
too busy with her thoughts to notice that her companions evidently
expected some demonstration on her part in view of the astonishing
news. Carrie was the only one who understood, and she explained,</p>

<p>"Kitty is so surprised she doesn't know what to say, do you,
Puss? Better open your letter and see what they write you about
it. Is it from Mrs. Vane?"</p>

<p>Tabitha's letter had remained unnoticed in her lap where Carrie
had tossed it, but now she lifted it, and inspected the envelope
before replying, "No, it is from Tom. Why&mdash;I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>think
<em>I&mdash;</em>won't read it just now."</p>

<p>Her flushed face had paled, and she caught her breath sharply,
for the letter was post-marked Silver Bow instead of Reno; but
without further comment she slipped it into her Latin Book and
joined in the gay chatter with her companions, a secret fear tugging
at her heart.</p>

<p>Sometime later, after successfully eluding the laughing group,
she stole away to her room, locked the door, and tore open the
envelope with hands that trembled so violently she could scarcely
control them, whispering to herself, "What can Tom be doing at
home? College doesn't close for a month yet. I wonder if his money
is all gone, and he can't finish the term. Or has Dad sent for
him to help out in the mine? No, he wouldn't do that, surely."</p>

<p>She spread the rattling paper out on the table, and with difficulty
spelled out the scrawl written with pencil and evidently in much
haste. The message was brief:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Dear Puss:<br/>
&mdash;I suppose you have already heard the good news of<br/>
the strike on Dad's claims. I meant to have written you about it<br/>
before, but have been too busy. The vein is larger than at first<br/>
appeared, and quite rich; but of course we can't tell yet<br/>
whether it is more than a pocket. We think it is a sure-enough<br/>
vein, however.

</p>
<p>
In timbering a shaft which threatened to cave in, Dad was hurt,<br/>
and they sent for me. We have him at the house, for he refused<br/>
to be taken to the Miners' Hospital. I am glad it happened so<br/>
near the end of the college year. If he gets along all right, I<br/>
can take the examinations I must miss now in September, and go<br/>
along with the work of the class next year. When will your<br/>
school be out? I don't think you have ever said. I suppose you<br/>
are busy now getting ready for examinations&mdash;or don't you have<br/>
such things there? Don't study <em>too</em> hard, Puss, and don't be<br/>
alarmed about Dad.

</p>
<p>
With love,    <em>TOM</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The letter fluttered unheeded to the floor, and Tabitha, having
read anxiety between the lines, sat in a brown study.</p>

<p>Dad hurt, Tom at home, Aunt Maria in the East! She was only a
little girl, but she could help a great deal around the house,
and maybe&mdash;maybe she could be of assistance in the sick-room.
She shuddered at this thought, for fear of her father was still
strong in her heart. But she could not shirk her duty; she must
go home. She gathered up the letter, stole out of the room and
down to the principal's office, where she found Miss Pomeroy still
at work at her desk.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" asked the busy woman, smiling up from her
papers at the sober yet determined black eyes.</p>

<p>"I am going home," answered the girl, laying Tom's message on
the desk and waiting for it to be read.</p>

<p>When Miss Pomeroy had finished, she turned to the child at her
side, and slipping her arm about the slight figure, drew her close,
saying, "You think they need you, dear? He doesn't say anything
about wanting you to come."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom wouldn't ask me to come, no matter how much he might
want me. But there is no one at home in Silver Bow to take care
of Dad, except Tom, and men don't know much about nursing sick
folks. I <em>ought</em> to go."</p>

<p>"I think your decision is the right one, Tabitha," said the sweet
voice after a long pause. "I don't like to see you go, but I am
glad for your sake that school is so nearly done that you will
lose only a few weeks. That can easily be made up during the summer.
Your teachers will tell you how much further to study. I am so
sorry, little girl, that this has happened! I will do anything
in my power to help you, and would urge you to stay and finish
the term, only that I would not want to keep you when you feel
that you may be needed there. When do you want to go?"</p>

<p>"Tonight," was the prompt reply, for some way Miss Pomeroy's
words gave her added courage in her hard decision, and she wanted
to be gone before she had a chance to repent. "Don't tell the
girls. It is hard to have to leave just now when the year is so
nearly done, though if I must go, I am glad I shall miss only
four weeks more of school. But I really can't say good-by to anyone.
It has been <em>so</em> lovely here, Miss Pomeroy!"</p>

<p>"Dear little Tabitha," murmured the woman tenderly. "It has been
lovely to have you with us, too, and I shall look forward to next
autumn to bring back our precious girl who is not only learning
life's great lessons herself, but is also teaching us the beauty
of living. Go now to your packing. I will send Miss Summers to
help you, and will myself attend to your ticket. As soon as the
trunk is ready, John will take it to the depot and have it checked.
Keep a brave heart under the little jacket, dear, and remember
the One who is everywhere."</p>

<p>So a few hours later she was helped aboard the train by the dusky
porter, and was whirled away into the darkness of the night toward
home, cheered but anxious.</p>
