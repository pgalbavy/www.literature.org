<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>At last the excitement had died out in Sambir.  The inhabitants
got used to the sight of comings and goings between Almayer's
house and the vessel, now moored to the opposite bank, and speculation
as to the feverish activity displayed by Almayer's boatmen in
repairing old canoes ceased to interfere with the due discharge
of domestic duties by the women of the Settlement.  Even the baffled
Jim-Eng left off troubling his muddled brain with secrets of trade,
and relapsed by the aid of his opium pipe into a state of stupefied
bliss, letting Babalatchi pursue his way past his house uninvited
and seemingly unnoticed.</p>

<p>So on that warm afternoon, when the deserted river sparkled under
the vertical sun, the statesman of Sambir could, without any hindrance
from friendly inquirers, shove off his little canoe from under
the bushes, where it was usually hidden during his visits to Almayer's
compound. Slowly and languidly Babalatchi paddled, crouching low
in the boat, making himself small under his as enormous sun hat
to escape the scorching heat reflected from the water.  He was
not in a hurry; his master, Lakamba, was surely reposing at this
time of the day.  He would have ample time to cross over and greet
him on his waking with important news.  Will he be displeased? 
Will he strike his ebony wood staff angrily on the floor, frightening
him by the incoherent violence of his exclamations; or will he
squat down with a good-humoured smile, and, rubbing his hands
gently over his stomach with a familiar gesture, expectorate copiously
into the brass siri-vessel, giving vent to a low, approbative
murmur?  Such were Babalatchi's thoughts as he skilfully handled
his paddle, crossing the river on his way to the Rajah's campong,
whose stockades showed from behind the dense foliage of the bank
just opposite to Almayer's bungalow.</p>

<p>Indeed, he had a report to make.  Something certain at last to
confirm the daily tale of suspicions, the daily hints of familiarity,
of stolen glances he had seen, of short and burning words he had
overheard exchanged between Dain Maroola and Almayer's daughter.</p>

<p>Lakamba had, till then, listened to it all, calmly and with evident
distrust; now he was going to be convinced, for Babalatchi had
the proof; had it this very morning, when fishing at break of
day in the creek over which stood Bulangi's house.  There from
his skiff he saw Nina's long canoe drift past, the girl sitting
in the stern bending over Dain, who was stretched in the bottom
with his head resting on the girl's knees.  He saw it.  He followed
them, but in a short time they took to the paddles and got away
from under his observant eye.  A few minutes afterwards he saw
Bulangi's slave-girl paddling in a small dug-out to the town with
her cakes for sale.  She also had seen them in the grey dawn. 
And Babalatchi grinned confidentially to himself at the recollection
of the slave-girl's discomposed face, of the hard look in her
eyes, of the tremble in her voice, when answering his questions. 
That little Taminah evidently admired Dain Maroola.  That was
good!  And Babalatchi laughed aloud at the notion; then becoming
suddenly serious, he began by some strange association of ideas
to speculate upon the price for which Bulangi would, possibly,
sell the girl.  He shook his head sadly at the thought that Bulangi
was a hard man, and had refused one hundred dollars for that same
Taminah only a few weeks ago; then he became suddenly aware that
the canoe had drifted too far down during his meditation.  He
shook off the despondency caused by the certitude of Bulangi's
mercenary disposition, and, taking up his paddle, in a few strokes
sheered alongside the watergate of the Rajah's house.</p>

<p>That afternoon Almayer, as was his wont lately, moved about on
the waterside, overlooking the repairs to his boats.  He had decided
at last. Guided by the scraps of information contained in old
Lingard's pocketbook, he was going to seek for the rich gold-mine,
for that place where he had only to stoop to gather up an immense
fortune and realise the dream of his young days.  To obtain the
necessary help he had shared his knowledge with Dain Maroola,
he had consented to be reconciled with Lakamba, who gave his support
to the enterprise on condition of sharing the profits; he had
sacrificed his pride, his honour, and his loyalty in the face
of the enormous risk of his undertaking, dazzled by the greatness
of the results to be achieved by this alliance so distasteful
yet so necessary.  The dangers were great, but Maroola was brave;
his men seemed as reckless as their chief, and with Lakamba's
aid success seemed assured.</p>

<p>For the last fortnight Almayer was absorbed in the preparations,
walking amongst his workmen and slaves in a kind of waking trance,
where practical details as to the fitting out of the boats were
mixed up with vivid dreams of untold wealth, where the present
misery of burning sun, of the muddy and malodorous river bank
disappeared in a gorgeous vision of a splendid future existence
for himself and Nina.  He hardly saw Nina during these last days,
although the beloved daughter was ever present in his thoughts. 
He hardly took notice of Dain, whose constant presence in his
house had become a matter of course to him now they were connected
by a community of interests.  When meeting the young chief he
gave him an absent greeting and passed on, seemingly wishing to
avoid him, bent upon forgetting the hated reality of the present
by absorbing himself in his work, or else by letting his imagination
soar far above the tree-tops into the great white clouds away
to the westward, where the paradise of Europe was awaiting the
future Eastern millionaire.  And Maroola, now the bargain was
struck and there was no more business to be talked over, evidently
did not care for the white man's company.  Yet Dain was always
about the house, but he seldom stayed long by the riverside. 
On his daily visits to the white man the Malay chief preferred
to make his way quietly through the central passage of the house,
and would come out into the garden at the back, where the fire
was burning in the cooking shed, with the rice kettle swinging
over it, under the watchful supervision of Mrs. Almayer.  Avoiding
that shed, with its black smoke and the warbling of soft, feminine
voices, Dain would turn to the left.  There, on the edge of a
banana plantation, a clump of palms and mango trees formed a shady
spot, a few scattered bushes giving it a certain seclusion into
which only the serving women's chatter or an occasional burst
of laughter could penetrate.  Once in, he was invisible; and hidden
there, leaning against the smooth trunk of a tall palm, he waited
with gleaming eyes and an assured smile to hear the faint rustle
of dried grass under the light footsteps of Nina.</p>

<p>From the very first moment when his eyes beheld this&mdash;to him&mdash;perfection
of loveliness he felt in his inmost heart the conviction that
she would be his; he felt the subtle breath of mutual understanding
passing between their two savage natures, and he did not want
Mrs. Almayer's encouraging smiles to take every opportunity of
approaching the girl; and every time he spoke to her, every time
he looked into her eyes, Nina, although averting her face, felt
as if this bold-looking being who spoke burning words into her
willing ear was the embodiment of her fate, the creature of her
dreams&mdash;reckless, ferocious, ready with flashing kriss for his
enemies, and with passionate embrace for his beloved&mdash;the ideal
Malay chief of her mother's tradition.</p>

<p>She recognised with a thrill of delicious fear the mysterious
consciousness of her identity with that being.  Listening to his
words, it seemed to her she was born only then to a knowledge
of a new existence, that her life was complete only when near
him, and she abandoned herself to a feeling of dreamy happiness,
while with half-veiled face and in silence&mdash;as became a Malay
girl&mdash;she listened to Dain's words giving up to her the whole
treasure of love and passion his nature was capable of with all
the unrestrained enthusiasm of a man totally untrammelled by any
influence of civilised self-discipline.</p>

<p>And they used to pass many a delicious and fast fleeting hour
under the mango trees behind the friendly curtain of bushes till
Mrs. Almayer's shrill voice gave the signal of unwilling separation. 
Mrs. Almayer had undertaken the easy task of watching her husband
lest he should interrupt the smooth course of her daughter's love
affair, in which she took a great and benignant interest.  She
was happy and proud to see Dain's infatuation, believing him to
be a great and powerful chief, and she found also a gratification
of her mercenary instincts in Dain's open-handed generosity.</p>

<p>On the eve of the day when Babalatchi's suspicions were confirmed
by ocular demonstration, Dain and Nina had remained longer than
usual in their shady retreat.  Only Almayer's heavy step on the
verandah and his querulous clamour for food decided Mrs. Almayer
to lift a warning cry. Maroola leaped lightly over the low bamboo
fence, and made his way stealthily through the banana plantation
down to the muddy shore of the back creek, while Nina walked slowly
towards the house to minister to her father's wants, as was her
wont every evening.  Almayer felt happy enough that evening; the
preparations were nearly completed; to-morrow he would launch
his boats.  In his mind's eye he saw the rich prize in his grasp;
and, with tin spoon in his hand, he was forgetting the plateful
of rice before him in the fanciful arrangement of some splendid
banquet to take place on his arrival in Amsterdam.  Nina, reclining
in the long chair, listened absently to the few disconnected words
escaping from her father's lips.  Expedition!  Gold!  What did
she care for all that?  But at the name of Maroola mentioned by
her father she was all attention. Dain was going down the river
with his brig to-morrow to remain away for a few days, said Almayer. 
It was very annoying, this delay.  As soon as Dain returned they
would have to start without loss of time, for the river was rising. 
He would not be surprised if a great flood was coming. And he
pushed away his plate with an impatient gesture on rising from
the table.  But now Nina heard him not.  Dain going away!  That's
why he had ordered her, with that quiet masterfulness it was her
delight to obey, to meet him at break of day in Bulangi's creek. 
Was there a paddle in her canoe? she thought.  Was it ready? 
She would have to start early&mdash;at four in the morning, in a very
few hours.</p>

<p>She rose from her chair, thinking she would require rest before
the long pull in the early morning.  The lamp was burning dimly,
and her father, tired with the day's labour, was already in his
hammock.  Nina put the lamp out and passed into a large room she
shared with her mother on the left of the central passage.  Entering,
she saw that Mrs. Almayer had deserted the pile of mats serving
her as bed in one corner of the room, and was now bending over
the opened lid of her large wooden chest.  Half a shell of cocoanut
filled with oil, where a cotton rag floated for a wick, stood
on the floor, surrounding her with a ruddy halo of light shining
through the black and odorous smoke.  Mrs. Almayer's back was
bent, and her head and shoulders hidden in the deep box.  Her
hands rummaged in the interior, where a soft clink as of silver
money could be heard.  She did not notice at first her daughter's
approach, and Nina, standing silently by her, looked down on many
little canvas bags ranged in the bottom of the chest, wherefrom
her mother extracted handfuls of shining guilders and Mexican
dollars, letting them stream slowly back again through her claw-like
fingers.  The music of tinkling silver seemed to delight her,
and her eyes sparkled with the reflected gleam of freshlyminted
coins.  She was muttering to herself: "And this, and this, and
yet this!  Soon he will give more&mdash;as much more as I ask.  He
is a great Rajah&mdash;a Son of Heaven!  And she will be a Ranee&mdash;he
gave all this for her!  Who ever gave anything for me?  I am a
slave!  Am I?  I am the mother of a great Ranee!"  She became
aware suddenly of her daughter's presence, and ceased her droning,
shutting the lid down violently; then, without rising from her
crouching position, she looked up at the girl standing by with
a vague smile on her dreamy face.</p>

<p>"You have seen.  Have you?" she shouted, shrilly.  "That is all
mine, and for you.  It is not enough!  He will have to give more
before he takes you away to the southern island where his father
is king.  You hear me? You are worth more, granddaughter of Rajahs! 
More!  More!"</p>

<p>The sleepy voice of Almayer was heard on the verandah recommending
silence.  Mrs. Almayer extinguished the light and crept into her
corner of the room.  Nina laid down on her back on a pile of soft
mats, her hands entwined under her head, gazing through the shutterless
hole, serving as a window at the stars twinkling on the black
sky; she was awaiting the time of start for her appointed meeting-place. 
With quiet happiness she thought of that meeting in the great
forest, far from all human eyes and sounds.  Her soul, lapsing
again into the savage mood, which the genius of civilisation working
by the hand of Mrs. Vinck could never destroy, experienced a feeling
of pride and of some slight trouble at the high value her worldly-wise
mother had put upon her person; but she remembered the expressive
glances and words of Dain, and, tranquillised, she closed her
eyes in a shiver of pleasant anticipation.</p>

<p>There are some situations where the barbarian and the, so-called,
civilised man meet upon the same ground.  It may be supposed that
Dain Maroola was not exceptionally delighted with his prospective
mother-inlaw, nor that he actually approved of that worthy woman's
appetite for shining dollars.  Yet on that foggy morning when
Babalatchi, laying aside the cares of state, went to visit his
fish-baskets in the Bulangi creek, Maroola had no misgivings,
experienced no feelings but those of impatience and longing, when
paddling to the east side of the island forming the back-water
in question.  He hid his canoe in the bushes and strode rapidly
across the islet, pushing with impatience through the twigs of
heavy undergrowth intercrossed over his path.  From motives of
prudence he would not take his canoe to the meeting-place, as
Nina had done.  He had left it in the main stream till his return
from the other side of the island.  The heavy warm fog was closing
rapidly round him, but he managed to catch a fleeting glimpse
of a light away to the left, proceeding from Bulangi's house. 
Then he could see nothing in the thickening vapour, and kept to
the path only by a sort of instinct, which also led him to the
very point on the opposite shore he wished to reach. A great log
had stranded there, at right angles to the bank, forming a kind
of jetty against which the swiftly flowing stream broke with a
loud ripple.  He stepped on it with a quick but steady motion,
and in two strides found himself at the outer end, with the rush
and swirl of the foaming water at his feet.</p>

<p>Standing there alone, as if separated from the world; the heavens,
earth; the very water roaring under him swallowed up in the thick
veil of the morning fog, he breathed out the name of Nina before
him into the apparently limitless space, sure of being heard,
instinctively sure of the nearness of the delightful creature;
certain of her being aware of his near presence as he was aware
of hers.</p>

<p>The bow of Nina's canoe loomed up close to the log, canted high
out of the water by the weight of the sitter in the stern.  Maroola
laid his hand on the stem and leaped lightly in, giving it a vigorous
shove off. The light craft, obeying the new impulse, cleared the
log by a hair's breadth, and the river, with obedient complicity,
swung it broadside to the current, and bore it off silently and
rapidly between the invisible banks.  And once more Dain, at the
feet of Nina, forgot the world, felt himself carried away helpless
by a great wave of supreme emotion, by a rush of joy, pride, and
desire; understood once more with overpowering certitude that
there was no life possible without that being he held clasped
in his arms with passionate strength in a prolonged embrace.</p>

<p>Nina disengaged herself gently with a low laugh.</p>

<p>"You will overturn the boat, Dain," she whispered.</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes eagerly for a minute and let her go with
a sigh, then lying down in the canoe he put his head on her knees,
gazing upwards and stretching his arms backwards till his hands
met round the girl's waist.  She bent over him, and, shaking her
head, framed both their faces in the falling locks of her long
black hair.</p>

<p>And so they drifted on, he speaking with all the rude eloquence
of a savage nature giving itself up without restraint to an overmastering
passion, she bending low to catch the murmur of words sweeter
to her than life itself.  To those two nothing existed then outside
the gunwales of the narrow and fragile craft.  It was their world,
filled with their intense and all-absorbing love.  They took no
heed of thickening mist, or of the breeze dying away before sunrise;
they forgot the existence of the great forests surrounding them,
of all the tropical nature awaiting the advent of the sun in a
solemn and impressive silence.</p>

<p>Over the low river-mist hiding the boat with its freight of young
passionate life and all-forgetful happiness, the stars paled,
and a silvery-grey tint crept over the sky from the eastward. 
There was not a breath of wind, not a rustle of stirring leaf,
not a splash of leaping fish to disturb the serene repose of all
living things on the banks of the great river.  Earth, river,
and sky were wrapped up in a deep sleep, from which it seemed
there would be no waking.  All the seething life and movement
of tropical nature seemed concentrated in the ardent eyes, in
the tumultuously beating hearts of the two beings drifting in
the canoe, under the white canopy of mist, over the smooth surface
of the river.</p>

<p>Suddenly a great sheaf of yellow rays shot upwards from behind
the black curtain of trees lining the banks of the Pantai.  The
stars went out; the little black clouds at the zenith glowed for
a moment with crimson tints, and the thick mist, stirred by the
gentle breeze, the sigh of waking nature, whirled round and broke
into fantastically torn pieces, disclosing the wrinkled surface
of the river sparkling in the broad light of day.  Great flocks
of white birds wheeled screaming above the swaying tree-tops. 
The sun had risen on the east coast.</p>

<p>Dain was the first to return to the cares of everyday life. 
He rose and glanced rapidly up and down the river.  His eye detected
Babalatchi's boat astern, and another small black speck on the
glittering water, which was Taminah's canoe.  He moved cautiously
forward, and, kneeling, took up a paddle; Nina at the stern took
hers.  They bent their bodies to the work, throwing up the water
at every stroke, and the small craft went swiftly ahead, leaving
a narrow wake fringed with a lace-like border of white and gleaming
foam.  Without turning his head, Dain spoke.</p>

<p>"Somebody behind us, Nina.  We must not let him gain.  I think
he is too far to recognise us."</p>

<p>"Somebody before us also," panted out Nina, without ceasing to
paddle.</p>

<p>"I think I know," rejoined Dain.  "The sun shines over there,
but I fancy it is the girl Taminah.  She comes down every morning
to my brig to sell cakes&mdash;stays often all day.  It does not matter;
steer more into the bank; we must get under the bushes.  My canoe
is hidden not far from here."</p>

<p>As he spoke his eyes watched the broad-leaved nipas which they
were brushing in their swift and silent course.</p>

<p>"Look out, Nina," he said at last; "there, where the water palms
end and the twigs hang down under the leaning tree.  Steer for
the big green branch."</p>

<p>He stood up attentive, and the boat drifted slowly in shore,
Nina guiding it by a gentle and skilful movement of her paddle. 
When near enough Dain laid hold of the big branch, and leaning
back shot the canoe under a low green archway of thickly matted
creepers giving access to a miniature bay formed by the caving
in of the bank during the last great flood.  His own boat was
there anchored by a stone, and he stepped into it, keeping his
hand on the gunwale of Nina's canoe.  In a moment the two little
nutshells with their occupants floated quietly side by side, reflected
by the black water in the dim light struggling through a high
canopy of dense foliage; while above, away up in the broad day,
flamed immense red blossoms sending down on their heads a shower
of great dew-sparkling petals that descended rotating slowly in
a continuous and perfumed stream; and over them, under them, in
the sleeping water; all around them in a ring of luxuriant vegetation
bathed in the warm air charged with strong and harsh perfumes,
the intense work of tropical nature went on: plants shooting upward,
entwined, interlaced in inextricable confusion, climbing madly
and brutally over each other in the terrible silence of a desperate
struggle towards the life-giving sunshine above&mdash;as if struck
with sudden horror at the seething mass of corruption below, at
the death and decay from which they sprang.</p>

<p>"We must part now," said Dain, after a long silence.  "You must
return at once, Nina.  I will wait till the brig drifts down here,
and shall get on board then."</p>

<p>"And will you be long away, Dain?" asked Nina, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Long!" exclaimed Dain.  "Would a man willingly remain long in
a dark place?  When I am not near you, Nina, I am like a man that
is blind.  What is life to me without light?"</p>

<p>Nina leaned over, and with a proud and happy smile took Dain's
face between her hands, looking into his eyes with a fond yet
questioning gaze.  Apparently she found there the confirmation
of the words just said, for a feeling of grateful security lightened
for her the weight of sorrow at the hour of parting.  She believed
that he, the descendant of many great Rajahs, the son of a great
chief, the master of life and death, knew the sunshine of life
only in her presence.  An immense wave of gratitude and love welled
forth out of her heart towards him.  How could she make an outward
and visible sign of all she felt for the man who had filled her
heart with so much joy and so much pride?  And in the great tumult
of passion, like a flash of lightning came to her the reminiscence
of that despised and almost forgotten civilisation she had only
glanced at in her days of restraint, of sorrow, and of anger. 
In the cold ashes of that hateful and miserable past she would
find the sign of love, the fitting expression of the boundless
felicity of the present, the pledge of a bright and splendid future. 
She threw her arms around Dain's neck and pressed her lips to
his in a long and burning kiss.  He closed his eyes, surprised
and frightened at the storm raised in his breast by the strange
and to him hitherto unknown contact, and long after Nina had pushed
her canoe into the river he remained motionless, without daring
to open his eyes, afraid to lose the sensation of intoxicating
delight he had tasted for the first time.</p>

<p>Now he wanted but immortality, he thought, to be the equal of
gods, and the creature that could open so the gates of paradise
must be his&mdash;soon would be his for ever!</p>

<p>He opened his eyes in time to see through the archway of creepers
the bows of his brig come slowly into view, as the vessel drifted
past on its way down the river.  He must go on board now, he thought;
yet he was loth to leave the place where he had learned to know
what happiness meant. "Time yet.  Let them go," he muttered to
himself; and he closed his eyes again under the red shower of
scented petals, trying to recall the scene with all its delight
and all its fear.</p>

<p>He must have been able to join his brig in time, after all, and
found much occupation outside, for it was in vain that Almayer
looked for his friend's speedy return.  The lower reach of the
river where he so often and so impatiently directed his eyes remained
deserted, save for the rapid flitting of some fishing canoe; but
down the upper reaches came black clouds and heavy showers heralding
the final setting in of the rainy season with its thunderstorms
and great floods making the river almost impossible of ascent
for native canoes.</p>

<p>Almayer, strolling along the muddy beach between his houses,
watched uneasily the river rising inch by inch, creeping slowly
nearer to the boats, now ready and hauled up in a row under the
cover of dripping Kajang-mats.  Fortune seemed to elude his grasp,
and in his weary tramp backwards and forwards under the steady
rain falling from the lowering sky, a sort of despairing indifference
took possession of him.  What did it matter?  It was just his
luck!  Those two infernal savages, Lakamba and Dain, induced him,
with their promises of help, to spend his last dollar in the fitting
out of boats, and now one of them was gone somewhere, and the
other shut up in his stockade would give no sign of life.  No,
not even the scoundrelly Babalatchi, thought Almayer, would show
his face near him, now they had sold him all the rice, brass gongs,
and cloth necessary for his expedition.  They had his very last
coin, and did not care whether he went or stayed.  And with a
gesture of abandoned discouragement Almayer would climb up slowly
to the verandah of his new house to get out of the rain, and leaning
on the front rail with his head sunk between his shoulders he
would abandon himself to the current of bitter thoughts, oblivious
of the flight of time and the pangs of hunger, deaf to the shrill
cries of his wife calling him to the evening meal. When, roused
from his sad meditations by the first roll of the evening thunderstorm,
he stumbled slowly towards the glimmering light of his old house,
his half-dead hope made his ears preternaturally acute to any
sound on the river.  Several nights in succession he had heard
the splash of paddles and had seen the indistinct form of a boat,
but when hailing the shadowy apparition, his heart bounding with
sudden hope of hearing Dain's voice, he was disappointed each
time by the sulky answer conveying to him the intelligence that
the Arabs were on the river, bound on a visit to the home-staying
Lakamba.  This caused him many sleepless nights, spent in speculating
upon the kind of villainy those estimable personages were hatching
now.  At last, when all hope seemed dead, he was overjoyed on
hearing Dain's voice; but Dain also appeared very anxious to see
Lakamba, and Almayer felt uneasy owing to a deep and ineradicable
distrust as to that ruler's disposition towards himself.  Still,
Dain had returned at last.  Evidently he meant to keep to his
bargain.  Hope revived, and that night Almayer slept soundly,
while Nina watched the angry river under the lash of the thunderstorm
sweeping onward towards the sea.</p>
