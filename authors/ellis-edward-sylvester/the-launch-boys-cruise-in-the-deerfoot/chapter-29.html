<p>To say the least, Mike Murphy was much disquieted when the engine
of the <em>Deerfoot</em> stopped dead and the boat began drifting
in the darkness, no one could say whither. Not knowing the right
thing to do, he seized hold of the fly-wheel, swung it back and
forth and part way round, and then suddenly let go, as he had
seen Alvin Landon do many times. Since there was no fuel in the
tank, it need not be said that this effort was fruitless.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he exclaimed at last as he straightened up; "if there
was somebody here to tell me the right thing to do I'd do the
same mighty quick, but this part of my eddycation was niglicted,
as me grandmither said when the taicher asked her if she knowed
the alphabet.</p>

<p>"I 'spose now that there be lots of handles which if I turned
'em the right way would start this old thing, but if I swung 'em
the wrong way&mdash;as I'd be sure to do &mdash;I'd bust her b'iler.
So I'll not try."</p>

<p>He sat down in one of the chairs to think, and his musings ran
riot, but the end was always the same: it was utterly beyond his
power to help himself out of the dilemma.</p>

<p>"I'll have to drift and drift till morning comes; then if I'm
not too fur out on the ocean somebody will pick me up. I'm thinking
the same is a good idee to lay low, as me cousin remarked whin
he was knocked down. Some boat is likely to run into me 'cause
I haven't any lights burning, and as she's going by I'll grab
her&mdash;whisht! phwat's that?" he asked himself, with a new thrill
of alarm.</p>

<p>The sound that had startled him was a distinct jar of the boat.
At that moment, it was so dark he could not see beyond the flag
at the bow of the launch. Nothing amiss was discerned in that
direction, but a second bump caused him to glance to the left,
and then he received the answer to his question.</p>

<p>The boat had drifted against a pile of rocks, which come down
to the edge of the sea on one of the two little uninhabited masses
of sand and stones, known as the White Islands. This was the northern
one, opposite Fisherman Island, from which it is separated by
more than a mile of the sea.</p>

<p>The sudden discovery rattled Mike for the moment and caused him
to do a foolish thing, which he never would have done had he taken
a half minute for reflection. His dread was that the boat would
be battered to pieces on the rocks. With no thought of his own
safety, he sprang from the cockpit, placed one foot on the gunwale
and leaped as far as he could, his purpose being to push the craft
clear. With all his strength&mdash;and he possessed a good deal of
it&mdash;he barely succeeded. He fell on his face and knees, and had
he not clutched desperately and seized a craggy point he would
have slipped back into the water.</p>

<p>What he ought to have done, as he recalled the next instant,
was to use the pole on the boat to press against the rocks and
shove the launch clear. That would have been easy and effective,
but it was too late now to think of it.</p>

<p>The reactive force of his body as he leaped drove the boat back
perceptibly. Inasmuch as the current had swept it forward in the
first place, the action would have been repeated but for a curious
condition which quickly showed itself. Had the boat struck farther
south, its return after being forced away would have occurred.
Had it first drifted farther north it would have cleared the islet
altogether, and continued floating toward the lower end of Southport,
but it so came about that when the current regained control of
the launch and shoved it westward again, it just cleared the northern
end of the mass of rocks and was swallowed up in the enshrouding
gloom.</p>

<p>Mike Murphy stumbled as near as he could to the <em>Deerfoot</em>
and stared out in the darkness. A moment after it disappeared
a partial clearing of the clouds in front of the moon brought
it dimly into sight again. This lasted but a brief interval when
it vanished for good.</p>

<p>"Good-by," called the lad. "I did the best fur ye that I knowed,
and now ye must take care of yersilf, which the same has to be
done by Mike Murphy."</p>

<p>The youth was a philosopher, and with his rugged health and naturally
buoyant spirits he took the rosiest view he could of his situation.
It was clear that in more than one respect he was better off on
this mass of rocks and sand than in the launch&mdash;that is, during
the darkness. So long as he was afloat with no lights burning,
he was in great danger of being run down by some larger boat.
In the event of such a calamity he was liable to be caught in
a crush where his life preserver could not save him.</p>

<p>But no such fate could overtake the lad while on the islet. The
<em>Mauretania</em> or <em>Lusitania</em> or even the <em>Olympic</em>
could not run into that collection of rocks and sand without getting
the worst of it.</p>

<p>Now, as has been shown, Mike was really safer where he had landed,
for no harm could come to him on White Island, yet his situation
was anything but pleasant. He was marooned and could not leave
his ocean prison without help. There was little hope of anything
of the kind so long as night remained with him, but the morrow
ought to bring rescue. Until then he must content himself as best
he could.</p>

<p>But he was not the one to sit down with folded hands. Nature
had gifted him with a powerful voice and he fancied he might turn
it to use. A twinkling light gliding or bobbing over the water
here and there showed that not all the world was asleep. His own
experience told him he had neighbors. Accordingly he lifted up
his voice and shouted with might and main:</p>

<p>"Hilp! hilp! somebody come to me hilp!"</p>

<p>He directed the tones toward different points of the compass,
but a half hour passed, during which perforce he often rested,
without any sign of success. And then he was thrilled by what
resembled a lantern, twinkling from the direction of the Hypocrites
to the westward. He renewed his call, and to add force to it,
waved his arms and danced up and down on the rock to whose top
he had climbed, though of course such antics were of no help.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes removed all doubt. The light, sinking and falling
with the moderate waves, was drawing nearer. Although his voice
had grown husky, he spared it not.</p>

<p>"Right this way! Don't be afeard! I won't hurt ye! Hurry up,
ye spalpeens!"</p>

<p>A hundred yards or so off&mdash;too far for him to see the boat or
its occupants&mdash;the rowers paused. From out the gloom came the
call:</p>

<p>"Hello there! what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I'm shipwrecked! Come and take me off!"</p>

<p>The words must have sounded suspicious to those for whom they
were intended.</p>

<p>"How came you to be cast away?"</p>

<p>"I landed here awhile ago and when I warn't looking me owld boat
slipped from me, bad cess to her!"</p>

<p>This was less satisfactory to the two men, who were probably
robbing lobster pots. They talked together for a few minutes,
though the anxious listener could not hear what they said.</p>

<p>"What boat was it?" asked the one who acted as spokesman.</p>

<p>"The <em>Deerfut</em>&mdash;a motor boat that b'longs to me friend
Alvin Landon, whose dad owns half the city of New York. He'll
give ye a million dollars fur taking care of Mike Murphy, which
is mesilf."</p>

<p>This announcement had an altogether different effect from what
the youth expected.</p>

<p>"If you're worth that much we'll let some one else earn the money.
Good night!"</p>

<p>It was an act of wanton cruelty, but it is a fact none the less
that the couple closed their ears to the appeal and rowed away
in the darkness. When certain that they were deserting him Mike
changed the tenor of his prayer and urged them to come back long
enough to receive the chastisement he was aching to give them.</p>

<p>It was a bitter disappointment, but the lad felt he had more
cause to be grateful to heaven that he had to repine.</p>

<p>"I may as well make up me mind to stay here a bit, as Jim O'Toole
said whin he begun his ten years sintence in jail. The weather
is mild, and though it looks like rain I don't think it will come
yet awhile. I'll saak me couch and go to sleep."</p>

<p>The danger of bruises from a fall prevented his groping long
for shelter. Exposed to the open sea the islet was swept by a
gentle breeze which brought the ocean's coolness with it. After
much care and patience, he found a place where he was quite well
screened. Passing his hands over the rough surface, he said with
a touch of his waggishness which seemed never to leave him:</p>

<p>"This is softer than anywhere ilse, as me mother said whin she
took her hands out of the dough and laid 'em on me head."</p>

<p>Mike never forgot his prayers, and when he lay down he was in
a thankful frame of mind despite the trying experiences through
which he had passed. Quite soon he was sleeping as profoundly
as if in his bed at home. Such is the reward of good habits and
right living.</p>

<p>The night must have been well along when he sank into unconsciousness.
That his tired body needed the rest was proved by the fact that
he did not open his eyes until half the next day was past. He
felt stiff and cramped from lying so long on his hard couch, and
it was several minutes before he recalled all the events of the
preceding day and night.</p>

<p>Climbing to the top of the highest rock he gazed out over the
waters. He felt no concern for the <em>Deerfoot</em>, which had
played him the shabby trick, for if he saw it he could expect
nothing from it. His most poignant consciousness was that he never
was so hungry in his life. He could not recall that he had ever
gone without food so long, and his craving gave him more anxiety
than did the future.</p>

<p>In whichever direction he turned his gaze he saw small boats,
schooners, brigs, steamers and various kinds of vessels, most
of them too far off for him to hope to attract their attention.
The nearest was a schooner, more than a mile away and gliding
northward. It so happened that much the larger number of craft
were heading outward. Mike shrewdly reflected:</p>

<p>"If they pick me up they'll niver turn round to take me home,
but will speed away to the ither side of the world. I must catch
one of 'em that's coming in, so he won't lose time in giving me
a lift."</p>

<p>He picked his way to the southern end of the islet, where a broad
sweep of water separated him from the other bit of land, and gazed
out over the vast Atlantic which swept from horizon to horizon.</p>

<p>"I would display a flag of distriss on the top of a pole, if
it warn't fur two raisons. The first is I haven't any pole to
erict on these rocks, and the ither is that I'd have to use me
own clothes for the flag, which the same would be apt to drive
away all hilp."</p>

<p>Mike Murphy cut a strange figure, dancing, shouting, swinging
his arms and waving his cap, but sad to say not a solitary person
seemed to see him, or else he not did think it worth while to
give further attention to the marooned youth.</p>

<p>"It looks loike it will be a failure, as Tim Ryan said whin he
tried to throw the prize bull over a stone wall."</p>

<p>Accordingly, Mike returned to the upper end of the islet to learn
whether any hope lay in that direction. His growing fear was that
he was in danger of starving to death.</p>

<p>"Anither night will doot," he said, despairing for the moment&mdash;"<em>PHWAT</em>!"</p>

<p>The first look northward showed him the <em>Deerfoot</em>, speeding
past barely a fourth of a mile distant. Had he not spent so much
time at the other end of his refuge he would have observed her
long before.</p>

<p>He stood for a spell unable to believe the evidence of his senses.
Then, when the glorious truth burst upon him, he uttered the words
that have already been recorded.</p>
