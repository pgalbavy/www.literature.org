<p>Peace awoke to find herself lying in a narrow iron bed, drawn
close beside a window, through which she could see clouds of great,
feathery snow-flakes swirling lazily, softly downwards; and not
remembering where she was or how she came to be there, she murmured
half aloud, "The angels seem to be shedding their feathers pretty
lively today, don't they?"</p>

<p>"What did you say?" asked a strange voice from somewhere in the
background, and a sweet face framed in glossy black hair bent
over her.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's heaven after all," mused Peace to herself, "though
I should think they would have dec'rations on the walls of heaven,
'nstead of leaving 'em naked." Then she spoke aloud, surprised
at the effort it cost her, "Are you a dead nurse?"</p>

<p>"Do I look very dead?" questioned the strange voice again, and
the face above her broke into a rare smile.</p>

<p>"Well, then, how did you get to heaven?"</p>

<p>"This isn't heaven, dear. You are in Danbury Hospital. Have you
forgotten?"</p>

<p>"O, that's so. I remember now. It's nice to know you ain't an
angel."</p>

<p>The nurse laughed outright. "Yes, I'm glad, too, for I want to
live a long time. The world is full of so many things I want to
see."</p>

<p>"That's me, too, but I thought I was dead sure this time."</p>

<p>"No, dear, you are very much alive and are going to get well."</p>

<p>"That's good, but what's the matter? I can't get my breath."</p>

<p>"It's the ether, childie. You will be all right soon, but you
must not talk now. Just rest. Sleep if you can, so you can visit
with Grandfather and Grandmother Campbell. They are anxious to
see you."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, downstairs in the office of the great hospital, the
President and his wife had sat like statues through all those
interminable minutes which were to tell the story of whether the
little life was to be spared or sacrificed. Vaguely they heard
the bustle of busy nurses, vaguely they saw the doctors hurrying
in and out about their duties; but not once did either man or
woman move from the great chairs in which they sat. Sometimes
it seemed to the matron and head-nurse, who occasionally passed
that way, as if both had been turned to stone, so fixed was their
gaze, so rigid their bodies. But in reality neither had ever been
more keenly alive. Each heart was reviewing with painful accuracy
the two short years that had gone since the little band of orphans
had come to live with them. How much had happened in that time,
and how dearly they had come to love each one of the sisters!</p>

<p>"I could not care more for them if they were my own," whispered
Mrs. Campbell to herself.</p>

<p>"They are like my own flesh and blood," thought the President.</p>

<p>"I know a mother is not supposed to have favorites among her
children," mused Mrs. Campbell, half guiltily, "but there is something
about Peace which makes her seem just a little the dearest to
me."</p>

<p>"They are all such lovable girls," the President told himself,
"but somehow I can't help liking Peace a little the best. Everyone
does. I wonder why."</p>

<p>So they sat there side by side in the great hospital and pondered,
waiting for the verdict from the white room above them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dr. Shumway stood before them. "It is all over," he
began, smiling cheerfully. "She will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All over," whispered Mrs. Campbell, and fainted quite away.</p>

<p>When she opened her eyes again, the young doctor was bending
over her, chafing her hands, and she heard his remorseful voice
saying, "My dear Mrs. Campbell, you misunderstood me. The operation
was successful. The little one will live."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I know," sighed the woman. "But it was such a relief
to know the ordeal was ended that I couldn't bear the joy of the
news. I am all right now. When can we see our girl?"</p>

<p>Quickly the good news was flashed over the wires to the anxious
hearts in Martindale, "Operation successful. Peace will walk again."
And great was the rejoicing everywhere.</p>

<p>Only Peace herself seemed undisturbed, taking everything as a
matter of course, obeying the nurse's orders, and asking no questions
concerning her own welfare, though she asked enough about other
people's affairs to make up, and soon became a source of unending
amusement to the hospital attendants, who made every excuse imaginable
to talk with this dear little, queer little patient in her room.</p>

<p>Peace was in her element. Nothing suited her quite so well as
to make new friends, and she was delighted at the interest the
busy nurses and doctors displayed in her case. "Why, Miss Wayne,"
she sighed ecstatically one day when she had been in the hospital
for a month, "I know the name of every nurse and doctor in this
building, and pretty near all the patients. The only trouble with
them is they change so often I really can't get much acquainted
before they go home. I'm just wild to get into that wheel-chair
which Dr. Dick has promised me as soon as I get strong enough;
for then I can go visiting the other sick folks, can't I? Dr.
Dick says I can, and I'm crazy to see what they look like. I can't
tell very well from what the nurses say about their patients just
what they look like. I try to 'magine while I'm lying here all
day, but you know how 'tis,&mdash;the ones who have the prettiest names
are as homely as sin usually; and the pretty ones have the homely
names.</p>

<p>"There's the little lady down the hall who keeps sending me jelly
and things she can't eat. The head nurse, Miss Gee,&mdash;ain't that
an awful funny name? I call her Skew Gee, because her first name
is Sue. Well, she told me that this lady has been in the hospital
four years. <em>Four years!</em> Think of it! And that she never
says a cross word to anyone, but when the pain gets bad she sings
until it's better. No wonder that man loved her and wanted to
marry her even if she will always be an invalid."</p>

<p>"What do you know about love and marriage?" teased the nurse,
laying out fresh linen and testing the water in a huge bowl by
the bed.</p>

<p>"I know I'd have married her, too, if I'd been in his shoes.
She must be a darling. I'm very anxious to see if she is pretty.
Miss Gee says she is. She says that typhoid girl is pretty, too.
The one who has been here ten weeks now and is still so sick.
I don't s'pose they'd let me see her yet. She calls one of her
legs Isaiah and the other Jeremiah, 'cause one of 'em doesn't
bother her and the other does. Isaiah in the Bible told about
the good things that were going to happen, and Jeremiah was always
growling about the bad things that had happened. She must be a
funny girl to figure all that out, don't you think? Then there
are those two little girls in the Children's Ward,&mdash;the one with
the hip disease that's been here two whole years, and the other
that's got <em>pugnacious</em> aenemia. I'd like awful well to
see them, 'cause neither one has a mother. And there's the weenty,
weenty woman with nervous <em>prospertation</em>, but I'm most
p'ticularly interested in Billy Bolee.</p>

<p>"Nurse Redfern brought him in to see me a few minutes ago, while
you were eating your breakfast. Isn't he the prettiest little
fellow you ever saw, and hasn't he got the worst name? I don't
see what his mother could be thinking about to call him that."</p>

<p>"But that isn't his real name, dear," answered the nurse, busy
at making her talkative little patient comfortable for the day.</p>

<p>"Then why do they call him that?"</p>

<p>"Because we don't know his real name. His mother died here in
the hospital weeks ago without telling us who she was or anything
about her history. The baby talked nothing but Dutch, and though
Dr. Kruger, of the hospital staff, is Dutch, he could not make
out from the child's baby-talk what his name is."</p>

<p>"And so they picked out that horrid Billy-Bolee name," exclaimed
Peace disgustedly.</p>

<p>"That was because he kept saying something which sounded like
Billy Bolee. We didn't know what he meant, but began to refer
to him in that manner, and the name stuck."</p>

<p>"Does he talk American now?"</p>

<p>"A little, but of course it is like learning to talk again, and
we often have to get Dr. Kruger to interpret his wants even yet.
I'll never forget one of the first nights he was here. He cried
and cried until the whole staff of nurses was nearly frantic,
because we could find nothing to soothe him. He kept repeating
some strange words, as if he was trying to tell us what he wanted,
but none of us understood. At that time we didn't even know his
nationality, but while he was still howling lustily, Dr. Kruger
came upstairs on his evening round of calls, and he stopped to
see what was the trouble with Miss Redfern's charge. Then how
he laughed! Poor Billy Bolee was begging to be put in bed, and
here we'd been trying for an hour to find out what was the matter."</p>

<p>Peace laughed heartily. "That was a good joke on the nurses,
wasn't it?" she remarked, when her merriment had subsided. "But
why do you keep him here now if his mother is dead?"</p>

<p>"The doctors are endeavoring to cure his little foot so he can
walk all right again. He was hurt in the same railroad accident
which killed his mother, and the injury has made one leg shorter
than the other."</p>

<p>"O," cried Peace in horror. "And he hasn't any relations to take
care of him after he gets well?"</p>

<p>"Not that we know of."</p>

<p>"Then what will you do with him? He can't live here always, can
he?"</p>

<p>"No. Some day he will have to be sent to a Children's Home or
some such institution where homeless waifs are cared for, until
some kind heart adopts him."</p>

<p>"But no one wants <em>lame</em> children to adopt," Peace protested.
"Do you s'pose Billy Bolee will ever get adopted?"</p>

<p>"We <em>hope</em> so."</p>

<p>Peace was silent a moment, then thoughtfully remarked, "There
was a fat old hen in our church&mdash;there! I didn't mean to say fat,
'cause I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world,&mdash;but Mrs.
Burns was fat, and she used to come over to our house after I
got hurt and tell me how thankful I ought to be. It made me awful
mad at first, but I b'lieve I know now what she meant. Now there's
my Lilac Lady,&mdash;she had heaps of money, and a great, splendid
house to live in, and Aunt Pen to take care of her; so even if
she never could walk again, 'twasn't as bad as it would have been
s'posing she was poor and didn't have anything of her own. Then
there's me. If I had fallen off a roof in Parker and cracked my
back, 'twould have been perfectly awful, 'cause there would have
been no money for doctors and such like, and I guess it costs
heaps to get operated on. But as it is now, I've got Grandpa and
Grandma Campbell to take care of me, and there ain't any danger
of my being sent to a Children's Home or the poor farm. There
are a pile of thankfuls in this world, ain't there?"</p>

<p>"Yes indeed," answered the nurse warmly. "This world is a pretty
good old world, and no matter what happens, there is always something
left for every one to be thankful about. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. That's what Papa used to tell us, and before every Thanksgiving
dinner we had to think up some p'tic'lar big thankful that had
happened to us that year. Even after he and Mamma had gone to
Heaven, Gail made us do the same thing, and you'd be s'prised
to see the things we dug up to be thankful about even if we were
<em>orphants</em>, and poorer than mice. One year I managed to
kill a turkey that b'longed to another man; so we had some meat
for dinner when we hadn't really expected any. 'Twasn't often
we got <em>turkey</em>, either,&mdash;not even when Papa was alive.
But we always have it at Grandpa's on Thanksgiving and Christmas.
I'm very fond of turkey, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am quite partial to Mr. Gobbler, too," smiled Miss Wayne
reminiscently, "but we nurses don't always get a taste of it on
Thanksgiving Day, either."</p>

<p>"Can't the hospital afford turkeys <em>once</em> a year?" asked
Peace in shocked surprise.</p>

<p>"But a nurse doesn't live at the hospital always, you know. After
she graduates, most of her cases are in private homes, and it
all depends upon where she is on the holidays as to what she gets
to eat or how she amuses herself. Now, Christmas Day this year
I spent with my married brother on his farm near St. Cloud, but
it is the first time I have been with any of my own people for
a holiday during the last four years. On Thanksgiving I was taking
care of a little girl who had diphtheria, and we were shut off
upstairs all by ourselves, seeing no one but the doctor from one
day's end to the next. Poor Zella was too sick to know what day
it was, and I was too anxious about her to care, so neither of
us got any turkey.</p>

<p>"One year I was miles out in the country, nursing a worn-out
mother, who had seven children, all younger than you. She was
a farmer's wife, and they were huddled in the dirtiest bit of
a hovel that I ever saw. The hogs and chickens used to come into
the kitchen whenever the door was opened, and no one ever thought
of driving them out. They didn't know what it meant to be clean,
and were shocked almost to death when I tried to give the latest
baby a bath. There wasn't a broom in the house and no one knew
what I wanted when I asked for a mop. We had literally to <em>shovel</em>
the dirt off those floors.</p>

<p>"The children had never been taught to pray, they knew absolutely
nothing about the Bible, had never even heard the name of Jesus
except in swearing. Christmas Day was unheard of, and Thanksgiving
a riddle; and when I asked the father if we might not have a hen
for dinner on that occasion, he said there were none to spare
for such nonsensical purposes."</p>

<p>"But you got one anyway, didn't you?" Peace eagerly asked, for
she had learned to love Miss Wayne dearly, and seemed to think
that the earnest, whole-hearted, sympathizing woman was capable
of anything.</p>

<p>"No, not from him," the nurse replied, knitting her brows as
if the thought still made her angry. "But his answer got my dander
up, and the children were so disappointed, for I had told them
all about our Thanksgiving Day, that I determined to cook them
a sure-enough Thanksgiving dinner if I could manage it. There
was one girl in the family,&mdash;little five-year-old Essie,&mdash;and
I gave her a half dollar and sent her over to their nearest neighbor
to see if he would sell us a small turkey. He had already disposed
of his turkeys, however, and had no hens for sale either; but
he gave Essie a big duck and a handful of silver in exchange for
the money she had given him, and she came back as proud as a peacock
to display her wares. I saw at once when she passed me the change
that he had not charged her a cent for the duck, so I put the
money back into her little hand and told her that she was to keep
it. At first she was reluctant, though her big, eager eyes showed
how much she really wanted it; and after a while I made her understand
that I actually meant to give it to her for her very own. But
when she took it to her mother, the little woman called me to
the bed and explained that it would do the child no good in that
form, because the lazy, shiftless, good-for-nothing father would
take it to buy tobacco. 'The children can't save a penny,' she
said sadly. 'When once he gets his hands on it, they never see
it again. But if you really want Essie to have the money, won't
you take it and buy her a doll? She has never had one of her own,
and it would please her more than anything you could do.'</p>

<p>"So I put the money back into my purse and promised Essie a doll
instead, which should open and shut its eyes and have real hair.
Christmas was near at hand, and I made up my mind that I would
dress the doll as daintily as possible and send it to her in time
for Christmas Eve, so the mother could put it in her little stocking,
for all the children had expressed a determination to hang up
their stockings that year like the children in the stories I had
told them. So, when about a week before Christmas, I was able
to leave the dirty little hovel, I searched the stores through
for the kind of a doll Essie wanted, and made it a beautiful set
of lace-trimmed clothes which really buttoned up. My mother and
sisters were greatly interested in the story of this neglected
family, and they decided that we must pack a box for all the children,
so none of the little stockings would be empty on Christmas morn.
Accordingly, we picked up some old clothing, whole and serviceable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just like the ladies do each year for the missionaries on the
frontier," Peace interrupted with breathless interest.</p>

<p>"Very much, only on a smaller scale. We didn't try to outfit
the whole family, but included something for each member,&mdash;except
the father,&mdash;and filled up the corners with candy and nuts. Poor
Mrs. Martin had been so interested in the Bible stories which
she had heard me telling the children that I got her a nicely
bound Bible, marking the passages which she had liked the best;
and she really seemed delighted to get it. She could write a little,
and she sent me a very grateful little letter of thanks when the
box arrived, telling me how much the children had enjoyed their
share of the good things, and particularly how pleased Essie was
with her doll.</p>

<p>"When I first went to care for Mrs. Martin on the worthless little
farm, there was only one stove in the ramshackle house and that
was in the kitchen. It was positively necessary to have her bed-room
warm and comfortable, so I made Mr. Martin get another stove for
that purpose. There was no chimney in that part of the house,
however, and he cut a hole through the ceiling and stuck the stove-pipe
through that into a big chamber above, where, by some means or
other, he connected it up with the kitchen chimney. It was very
unsafe, of course, and I protested against it, but he would not
listen to me; so all the while I was under that roof, I watched
the stove every minute, for fear it would set the house afire.
But it didn't, and he laughed at my worry, but not long after
I had left there while it was still very cold weather, the old
place did burn down one night. The family was rescued by their
neighbors, but they lost everything they had. Mrs. Martin wrote
me about the disaster, telling how sorry she was to lose her Bible,
and how terribly grieved Essie was over the loss of her treasure.
Naturally I was sorry, too, and when Christmas came again, I dressed
another doll for Essie, bought another Bible for Mrs. Martin,
and packed another box for the whole family. Again the mother
wrote me a letter of thanks, but it didn't sound sincere to me
this time, and when in closing she said that Jerry, her husband,
thought I might at least have included a plug of tobacco for him,
I made up my mind that all they wanted was what they could get
out of me."</p>

<p>"So you didn't send them any more dolls and Bibles," Peace soliloquized,
when the nurse paused in her narrative.</p>

<p>"They didn't appreciate them," Miss Wayne answered wistfully.
"One doesn't enjoy being liked for one's money. I want folks to
like <em>me</em>."</p>

<p>The little invalid lay with intent eyes fixed upon the ceiling
while she reviewed the story she had just heard; then she said
gravely, "I think it was Jerry who wrote for the plug of tobacco."</p>

<p>"Jerry!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Martin, I mean."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Martin wrote the letter."</p>

<p>"I'll bet he was peeking over her shoulder and made her put in
about that plug of tobacco, just the same," Peace persisted. "I
b'lieve Essie and her mother really cared. 'Twas him that wanted
just your money. Some women get married to some awful mean men."</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed the nurse, more to herself than for Peace's benefit.
"That is very true, and Jerry was one of them."</p>

<p>"There are lots of nice men, though," Peace hastened to add,
for Miss Wayne's face looked so unusually grave and sad. "There's
Grandpa and St. John, and&mdash;and Dr. Dick. <em>He</em> isn't married
yet, either. Neither is Dr. Race, is he? When I was in the sun
parlor yesterday afternoon, I heard one of the nurses tell that
new special that Miss Swift had set her <em>trap</em> for Dr.
Race. What did she mean? It sounded like they thought he was a
mouse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! O, Peace! You misunderstood. You mustn't repeat such things.
It &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>oh, dear, what can I say?"</p>

<p>"Well, I 'xpect they meant that Miss Swift is trying to marry
Dr. Race, and I s'pose the rest are jealous. Frances Sherrar is
going to be married to one of the professors at the University,
and I heard Gail telling Grandma how jealous some of the girls
are. I s'pose it's the same with the nurses. Only I sh'd hate
to see Dr. Race marry Miss Swift 'cause I don't like her. She's
too snippy. Why didn't you ever get married? You're so nice and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Wayne's face had flushed a brilliant crimson, and hastily
gathering up soap and towels, she made ready for a hurried flight,
but found her way blocked by a stalwart figure in the doorway,
whose twinkling eyes and smiling lips betrayed the fact that he
had overheard at least part of their conversation.</p>

<p>Embarrassed, the nurse set down the bowl of water poised perilously
on one arm, and stammered, "I &mdash;I beg your pardon, Dr. Shumway.
You are rather late this morning, or am I early? I mean, you &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there. Miss Wayne, don't get excited," a laughing voice
said teasingly. "Take heart. Remember, 'the Race is not always
to the Swift.'"</p>

<p>"O, Dr. Dick!" Peace interrupted from the little cot by the window.
"Is that you at last? I've been watching <em>hours</em> for you
to come. I've got the splendidest news to tell. <em>Gail</em>
is here,&mdash;my sister Gail. I know you will like her." Then, as
her eyes fell upon the great wicker chair which the doctor was
dragging behind him, she straightway forgot all else, and shrieked
ecstatically, "<em>Dr. Dick</em>, what have you got there? Is
it for me? A wheel-chair? Oh, oh, oh! Put me in it right away.
<em>Now</em> I can go and see some of the other sick folks, can't
I?"</p>
