bring real books to people through the Internet.</p>

<h1>New Site Update</h1>

<p>This site fell off the Internet a few years ago after some embarrassing oversights and confusion
around backups. Don't let this happen to you! Be more careful than we were.</p>
<p>The original site contents have now been mostly rescued with the wonderful help of
<a href="https://archive.org/web/">The Wayback Machine</a> and this 
<a href="https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader">Wayback Machine Downloader</a>.
Thanks to all those who provide these great tools for free.</p>

<p>After some work and lots of learning about how web technologies have evolved we can
present this new version of the site. The aim has been to update the look of the site to
give it a more modern feel, to make it work well on different device types and to improve navigation
through the library.</p>

<p>For those interested all the changes are on the client side and based on 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp">W3.CSS</a>. We have tried to keep the client-side
scripting as simple as possible and to avoid large frameworks. We hope that the behind the scenes changes
will also make it more straightforward to update and add new books.</p>

<p>There will be continual improvements where possible to your experience and any suggestions are more
than welcome, even if we cannot promise to act on them.</p>
</div>

<p>On this site you will find the <i>full and unabridged</i>
texts of classic works of English literature. Fiction from
<a href="/authors">authors</a> like <a href="/authors/carroll-lewis/">Lewis Carroll</a>,
the Bronte sisters (<a href="/authors/bronte-anne/">Anne</a>,
<a href="/authors/bronte-charlotte/">Charlotte</a> and <a
href="/authors/bronte-emily/">Emily</a>), <a
href="/authors/london-jack">Jack London</a>, <a
href="/authors/twain-mark">Mark Twain</a>, <a
href="/authors/dickens-charles">Charles Dickens</a> and many
others, and classic scientific works from <a
href="/authors/darwin-charles/">Charles Darwin</a> and <a
href="/authors/descartes-rene/">Rene Descartes</a>.</p>

<p>More books will be added soon, however as this site is
maintained by enthusiasts rather than professional librarians
this may be a very slow process.</p>

<p>Please let us know what you think, and what new books you
want added. For those who may not be familiar with Copyright
law, we are unable to make works available that are not in the
<i>public domain</i>. This mean, basically, nothing where the
author has not been dead for at least 75 to 90 years.</p>
