<p>After reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull.
He was worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid
business matters for which his mother had called him home. To throw
off this burden as quickly as possible, on the third day after his
arrival he went, angry and scowling and without answering questions as
to where he was going, to Mitenka's lodge and demanded an account of
everything. But what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew
even less than the frightened and bewildered Mitenka. The conversation
and the examination of the accounts with Mitenka did not last long.
The village elder, a peasant delegate, and the village clerk, who were
waiting in the passage, heard with fear and delight first the young
count's voice roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder, and
then words of abuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one after the other.</p>

<p>&quot;Robber!... Ungrateful wretch!... I'll hack the dog to pieces! I'm
not my father!... Robbing us!...&quot; and so on.</p>

<p>Then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red
in the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged Mitenka out by the scruff
of the neck and applied his foot and knee to him behind with great
agility at convenient moments between the words, shouting, &quot;Be off!
Never let me see your face here again, you villain!&quot;</p>

<p>Mitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the
shrubbery. (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for
culprits at Otradnoe. Mitenka himself, returning tipsy from the
town, used to hide there, and many of the residents at Otradnoe,
hiding from Mitenka, knew of its protective qualities.)</p>

<p>Mitenka's wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and
frightened faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar
was boiling and where the steward's high bedstead stood with its
patchwork quilt.</p>

<p>The young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, passed by
with resolute strides and went into the house.</p>

<p>The countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened
at the lodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would
certainly improve, but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect
this excitement might have on her son. She went several times to his
door on tiptoe and listened, as he lighted one pipe after another.</p>

<p>Next day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed
smile, said to him:</p>

<p>&quot;But you know, my dear boy, it's a pity you got excited! Mitenka has
told me all about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew,&quot; thought Nicholas, &quot;that I should never understand anything
in this crazy world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. But they
were carried forward- and you did not look at the other page.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Papa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is! And what I have
done, I have done; but, if you like, I won't speak to him again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, my dear boy&quot; (the count, too, felt embarrassed. He knew he
had mismanaged his wife's property and was to blame toward his
children, but he did not know how to remedy it). &quot;No, I beg you to
attend to the business. I am old. I...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. I
understand it all less than you do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Devil take all these peasants, and money matters, and carryings
forward from page to page,&quot; he thought. &quot;I used to understand what a
'corner' and the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to
another page I don't understand at all,&quot; said he to himself, and after
that he did not meddle in business affairs. But once the countess
called her son and informed him that she had a promissory note from
Anna Mikhaylovna for two thousand rubles, and asked him what he
thought of doing with it.</p>

<p>&quot;This,&quot; answered Nicholas. &quot;You say it rests with me. Well, I
don't like Anna Mikhaylovna and I don't like Boris, but they were
our friends and poor. Well then, this!&quot; and he tore up the note, and
by so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy. After
that, young Rostov took no further part in any business affairs, but
devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new
pursuit- the chase- for which his father kept a large establishment.</p>
