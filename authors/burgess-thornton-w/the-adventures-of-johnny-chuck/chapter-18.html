<p>Reddy Fox glared up at Sammy Jay. "What's the matter with you?"
snarled Reddy Fox. "Why don't you mind your own affairs, instead
of making trouble for other people?" You see, Reddy was afraid
that Johnny Chuck would hear Sammy Jay and take warning.</p>

<p>"Hello, Reddy Fox! I thought you had gone down to the Green Meadows!" 
Sammy said this as if he was very much surprised to see Reddy
there. He wasn't, for you know he had been watching Reddy hunt
for Johnny Chuck's new house, but Reddy had pretended that he
was going down to the Green Meadows early that morning, and so
now Sammy pretended that he had thought that Reddy really had
gone.</p>

<p>"I changed my mind!" he snapped. "What are you screaming so for?"</p>

<p>"Just to exercise my lungs, so as to be sure that I can scream
when I want to," replied Sammy, screaming still louder.</p>

<p>"Well, go somewhere else and scream; I want to sleep," said Reddy
crossly.</p>

<p>Now Sammy Jay knew perfectly well that Reddy Fox had no thought
of taking a nap but was hiding there to try to catch Johnny Chuck.
And Sammy knew that Farmer Brown's boy could hear him scream,
and that he knew that when Sammy screamed that way it meant there
was a fox about. Sitting in the top of the apple-tree, Sammy could
see Farmer Brown's boy starting for the old orchard, with Bowser
the Hound running ahead of him.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown's boy had no gun, so Sammy knew that no harm would
come to Reddy, but that Reddy would get a dreadful scare; and
that is what Sammy wanted, just out of pure mischief. So he screamed
louder than ever.</p>

<p>Reddy Fox lost his temper. He sat up and called Sammy Jay all
the bad names he could think of. He forgot where he was. He told
Sammy Jay what he thought of him and what he would do to him if
ever he caught him.</p>

<p>Sammy Jay kept right on screaming. He made such a noise that
Reddy didn't hear footsteps coming nearer and nearer. Suddenly
there was a great roar right behind him. "Bow, wow, wow! Bow,
wow, wow, wow!"&mdash;just like that.</p>

<p>Reddy was so frightened that he didn't even look to see where
he was jumping, and bumped his head against the apple-tree. Then
he started for the Green Forest, with Bowser the Hound at his
heels.</p>

<p>Sammy Jay laughed till he lost his breath and nearly tumbled
off his perch. Then he flew away, still laughing. He thought it
the greatest joke ever.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown's boy had followed Bowser the Hound into the old
orchard.</p>

<p>"I wonder what a fox was doing up here in broad daylight," said
he, talking to himself. "Perhaps one of my hens has stolen her
nest down here, and he has found it. I'll have a look, anyway."</p>

<p>So he walked on down to the far corner of the old orchard, straight
to the place from which he had seen Reddy Fox jump. When he got
there, of course he saw Johnny Chuck's new house right away.</p>

<p>"Ho!" cried Farmer Brown's boy. "Brer Fox was hunting Chucks.
I'll keep my eye on this, and if Mr. Chuck makes any trouble in
my garden, I'll know where to catch him."</p>
