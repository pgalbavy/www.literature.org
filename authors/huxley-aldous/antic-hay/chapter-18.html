<p>Two hundred and thirteen Sloane Street. The address, Rosie reflected,
as she vaporized synthetic lilies of the valley over all her sinuous
person, was decidedly a good one. It argued a reasonable prosperity,
attested a certain distinction. The knowledge of his address confirmed
her already high opinion of the bearded stranger who had so surprisingly
entered her life, as though in fulfilment of all the fortune-tellers’
prophecies that ever were made; had entered, yes, and intimately
made himself at home. She had been delighted, when the telegram
came that morning, to think that at last she was going to find
out something more about this man of mystery. For dark and mysterious
he had remained, remote even in the midst of the most intimate
contacts. Why, she didn’t even know his name. "Call me Toto,"
he had suggested, when she asked him what it was. And Toto she
had had to call him, for lack of anything more definite or committal.
But to-day he was letting her further into his secret. Rosie was
delighted. Her pink underclothing, she decided, as she looked
in the long glass, was really ravishing. She examined herself,
turning first one way, then the other, looking over her shoulder
to see the effect from behind. She pointed a toe, bent and straightened
a knee, applauding the length of her legs ("Most women," Toto
had said, "are like dachshunds"), their slenderness and plump
suavity of form. In their white stockings of Milanese silk they
looked delicious; and how marvellously, by the way, those Selfridge
people had mended those stockings by their new patent process!
Absolutely like new, and only charged four shillings. Well, it
was time to dress. Good-bye, then, to the pink underclothing and
the long white legs. She opened the wardrobe door. The moving
glass reflected, as it swung through its half-circle, pink bed,
rose-wreathed walls, little friends of her own age, and the dying
saint at his last communion. Rosie selected the frock she had
bought the other day at one of those little shops in Soho, there
they sell such smart things so cheaply to a clientage of minor
actresses and cocottes. Toto hadn’t seen it yet. She looked extremely
distinguished in it. The little hat, with its inch of veil hanging
like a mask, unconcealing and inviting, from the brim, suited
her to perfection. One last dab of powder, one last squirt of
synthetic lilies of the valley, and she was ready. She closed
the door behind her. St. Jerome was left to communicate in the
untenanted pinkness.</p>

<p>Mr. Mercaptan sat at his writing-table—an exquisitely amusing
affair in papier mâché, inlaid with floral decorations in mother-of-pearl
and painted with views of Windsor Castle and Tintern in the romantic
manner of Prince Albert’s later days—polishing to its final and
gem-like perfection one of his middle articles. It was on a splendid
subject—the ‘Jus Primæ Noctis, or Droit du Seigneur’—"that delicious
<em>droit</em>," wrote Mr. Mercaptan, "on which, one likes to
think, the Sovereigns of England insist so firmly in their motto,
<em>Dieu et mon Droit—de Seigneur</em>." That was charming, Mr.
Mercaptan thought, as he read it through. And he liked that bit
which began elegiacally: "But, alas! the Right of the First Night
belongs to a Middle Age as mythical, albeit happily different,
as those dismal epochs invented by Morris or by Chesterton. The
Lord’s right, as we prettily imagine it, is a figment of the baroque
imagination of the seventeenth century. It never existed. Or at
least it did exist, but as something deplorably different from
what we love to picture it." And he went on, eruditely, to refer
to that Council of Carthage which, in 398, demanded of the faithful
that they should be continent on their wedding-night. It was the
Lord’s right—the <em>droit</em> of a heavenly Seigneur. On this
text of fact, Mr. Mercaptan went on to preach a brilliant sermon
on that melancholy sexual perversion known as continence. How
much happier we all should be if the real historical <em>droit
du Seigneur</em> had in fact been the mythical right of our ‘pretty
prurient imaginations’! He looked forward to a golden age when
all should be seigneurs possessing rights that should have broadened
down into universal liberty. And so on. Mr. Mercaptan read through
his creation with a smile of satisfaction on his face. Every here
and there he made a careful correction in red ink. Over ‘pretty
prurient imaginations’ his pen hung for a full minute in conscientious
hesitation. Wasn’t it perhaps a little too strongly alliterative,
a shade, perhaps, cheap? Perhaps ‘pretty lascivious’ or ‘delicate
prurient’ would be better. He repeated the alternatives several
times, rolling the sound of them round his tongue, judicially,
like a tea-taster. In the end, he decided that ‘pretty prurient’
was right. ‘Pretty prurient’—they were the <em>mots justes</em>,
decidedly, without a question.</p>

<p>Mr. Mercaptan had just come to this decision and his poised pen
was moving farther down the page, when he was disturbed by the
sound of arguing voices in the corridor, outside his room.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mrs. Goldie?" he called irritably, for it was not
difficult to distinguish his housekeeper’s loud and querulous
tones. He had given orders that he was not to be disturbed. In
these critical moments of correction one needed such absolute
tranquillity.</p>

<p>But Mr. Mercaptan was to have no tranquillity this afternoon.
The door of his sacred boudoir was thrown rudely open, and there
strode in, like a Goth into the elegant marble vomitorium of Petronius
Arbiter, a haggard and dishevelled person whom Mr. Mercaptan recognized,
with a certain sense of discomfort, as Casimir Lypiatt.</p>

<p>"To what do I owe the <em>pleasure</em> of this unexpected...?"
Mr. Mercaptan began with an essay in offensive courtesy.</p>

<p>But Lypiatt, who had no feeling for the finer shades, coarsely
interrupted him. "Look here, Mercaptan," he said. "I want to have
a talk with you."</p>

<p>"Delighted, I’m sure," Mr. Mercaptan replied. "And <em>what</em>,
may I ask, about?" He knew, of course, perfectly well; and the
prospect of the talk disturbed him.</p>

<p>"About this," said Lypiatt; and he held out what looked like
a roll of paper.</p>

<p>Mr. Mercaptan took the roll and opened it out. It was a copy
of the <em>Weekly World</em>. "Ah!" said Mr. Mercaptan, in a tone
of delighted surprise, "<em>The World</em>. You have read my little
article?"</p>

<p>"That was what I wanted to talk to you about," said Lypiatt.</p>

<p>Mr. Mercaptan modestly laughed. "It hardly deserves it," he said.</p>

<p>Preserving a calm of expression which was quite unnatural to
him, and speaking in a studiedly quiet voice, Lypiatt pronounced
with careful deliberation: "It is a disgusting, malicious, ignoble
attack on me," he said.</p>

<p>"Come, <em>come</em>!" protested Mr. Mercaptan. "A critic must
be allowed to criticize."</p>

<p>"But there are limits," said Lypiatt.</p>

<p>"Oh, I <em>quite</em> agree," Mr. Mercaptan eagerly conceded.
"But, after all, Lypiatt, you can’t pretend that I have come anywhere
near those limits. If I had called you a _mur_derer, or even an
_adul_terer—then, I admit, you would have some cause to complain.
But I haven’t. There’s nothing like a personality in the whole
thing."</p>

<p>Lypiatt laughed derisively, and his face went all to pieces,
like a pool of water into which a stone is suddenly dropped.</p>

<p>"You’ve merely said I was insincere, an actor, a mountebank,
a quack, raving fustian, spouting mock heroics. That’s all."</p>

<p>Mr. Mercaptan put on the expression of one who feels himself
injured and misunderstood. He shut his eyes, he flapped deprecatingly
with his hand. "I <em>merely</em> suggested," he said, "that you
protest <em>too</em> much. You defeat your own ends; you lose
emphasis by trying to be over-emphatic. All this <em>folie de
grandeur</em>, all this hankering after <em>terribiltà</em>——"
sagely Mr. Mercaptan shook his head, "it’s led so <em>many</em>
people astray. And, in any case, you can’t <em>really</em> expect
<em>me</em> to find it very sympathetic." Mr. Mercaptan uttered
a little laugh and looked affectionately round his boudoir, his
retired and perfumed poutery within whose walls so much civilization
had finely flowered. He looked at his magnificent sofa, gilded
and carved, upholstered in white satin, and so deep—for it was
a great square piece of furniture, almost as broad as it was long—that
when you sat right back, you had of necessity to lift your feet
from the floor and recline at length. It was under the white satin
that Crébillon’s spirit found, in these late degenerate days,
a sympathetic home. He looked at his exquisite Condor fans over
the mantelpiece; his lovely Marie Laurencin of two young girls,
pale-skinned and berry-eyed, walking embraced in a shallow myopic
landscape amid a troop of bounding heraldic dogs. He looked at
his cabinet of <em>bibelots</em> in the corner where the nigger
mask and the superb Chinese phallus in sculptured rock crystal
contrasted so amusingly with the Chelsea china, the little ivory
Madonna, which might be a fake, but in any case was quite as good
as any mediæval French original, and the Italian medals. He looked
at his comical writing-desk in shining black papier mâché and
mother-of-pearl; he looked at his article on the "Jus Primæ Noctis,"
black and neat on the page, with the red corrections attesting
his tireless search for, and his, he flattered himself, almost
invariable discovery of, the inevitable word. No, really, one
couldn’t expect <em>him</em> to find Lypiatt’s notions very sympathetic.</p>

<p>"But I don’t expect you to," said Lypiatt, "and, good God! I
don’t want you to. But you call me insincere. That’s what I can’t
and won’t stand. How dare you do that?" His voice was growing
louder.</p>

<p>Once more Mr. Mercaptan deprecatingly flapped. "At the most,"
he corrected, "I said that there was a certain look of insincerity
about some of the pictures. Hardly avoidable, indeed, in work
of this kind."</p>

<p>Quite suddenly, Lypiatt lost his self-control. All the accumulated
anger and bitterness of the last days burst out. His show had
been a hopeless failure. Not a picture sold, a press that was
mostly bad, or, when good, that had praised for the wrong, the
insulting reasons. "Bright and effective work." "Mr. Lypiatt would
make an excellent stage designer." Damn them! damn them! And then,
when the dailies had all had their yelp, here was Mercaptan in
the <em>Weekly World</em> taking him as a text for what was practically
an essay on insincerity in art. "How dare you?" he furiously shouted.
"You—how dare you talk about sincerity? What can you know about
sincerity, you disgusting little bug!" And avenging himself on
the person of Mr. Mercaptan against the world that had neglected
him, against the fate that had denied him his rightful share of
talent, Lypiatt sprang up and, seizing the author of the "Jus
Primæ Noctis" by the shoulders, he shook him, he bumped him up
and down in his chair, he cuffed him over the head. "How can you
have the impudence," he asked, letting go of his victim, but still
standing menacingly over him, "to touch anything that even attempts
to be decent and big?" All these years, these wretched years of
poverty and struggle and courageous hope and failure and repeated
disappointment; and now this last failure, more complete than
all. He was trembling with anger; at least one forgot unhappiness
while one was angry.</p>

<p>Mr. Mercaptan had recovered from his first terrified surprise.
"Really, <em>really</em>" he repeated, "<em>too</em> barbarous.
Scuffling like hobbledehoys."</p>

<p>"If you knew," Lypiatt began; but he checked himself. If you
knew, he was going to say, what those things had cost me, what
they meant, what thought, what passion——But how could Mercaptan
understand? And it would sound as though he were appealing to
this creature’s sympathy. "Bug!" he shouted instead, "bug!" And
he struck out again with the flat of his hand. Mr. Mercaptan put
up his hands and ducked away from the slaps, blinking.</p>

<p>"Really," he protested, "<em>really</em>...."</p>

<p>Insincere? Perhaps it was half true. Lypiatt seized his man more
furiously than before and shook him, shook him. "And then that
vile insult about the vermouth advertisement," he cried out. That
had rankled. Those flaring, vulgar posters! "You thought you could
mock me and spit at me with impunity, did you? I’ve stood it so
long, you thought I’d always stand it? Was that it? But you’re
mistaken." He lifted his fist. Mr. Mercaptan cowered away, raising
his arm to protect his head. "Vile bug of a coward," said Lypiatt,
"why don’t you defend yourself like a man? You can only be dangerous
with words. Very witty and spiteful and cutting about those vermouth
posters, wasn’t it? But you wouldn’t dare to fight me if I challenged
you."</p>

<p>"Well, as a matter of <em>fact</em>," said Mr. Mercaptan, peering
up from under his defences, "I didn’t invent <em>that</em> particular
piece of criticism. I borrowed the <em>apéritif</em>." He laughed
feebly, more canary than bull.</p>

<p>"You borrowed it, did you?" Lypiatt contemptuously repeated.
"And who from, may I ask?" Not that it interested him in the least
to know.</p>

<p>"Well, if you really <em>want</em> to know," said Mr. Mercaptan,
"it was from our friend Myra Viveash."</p>

<p>Lypiatt stood for a moment without speaking, then putting his
menacing hand in his pocket, he turned away. "Oh!" he said noncommittally,
and was silent again.</p>

<p>Relieved, Mr. Mercaptan sat up in his chair; with the palm of
his right hand he smoothed his dishevelled head.</p>

<p>Airily, outside in the sunshine, Rosie walked down Sloane Street,
looking at the numbers on the doors of the houses. A hundred and
ninety-nine, two hundred, two hundred and one—she was getting
near now. Perhaps all the people who passed, strolling so easily
and elegantly and disengagedly along, perhaps they all of them
carried behind their eyes a secret, as delightful and amusing
as hers. Rosie liked to think so; it made life more exciting.
How nonchalantly distinguished, Rosie reflected, she herself must
look. Would any one who saw her now, sauntering along like this,
would any one guess that, ten houses farther down the street,
a young poet, or at least very nearly a young poet, was waiting,
on the second floor, eagerly for her arrival? Of course they wouldn’t
and couldn’t guess! That was the fun and the enormous excitement
of the whole thing. Formidable in her light-hearted detachment,
formidable in the passion which at will she could give rein to
and check again, the great lady swam beautifully along through
the sunlight to satisfy her caprice. Like Diana, she stooped over
the shepherd boy. Eagerly the starving young poet waited, waited
in his garret. Two hundred and twelve, two hundred and thirteen.
Rosie looked at the entrance and was reminded that the garret
couldn’t after all be very sordid, nor the young poet absolutely
starving. She stepped in and, standing in the hall, looked at
the board with the names. Ground floor: Mrs. Budge. First floor:
F. de M. Rowbotham. Second floor: P. Mercaptan.</p>

<p>P. Mercaptan.... But it was a charming name, a romantic name,
a real young poet’s name! Mercaptan—she felt more than ever pleased
with her selection. The fastidious lady could not have had a happier
caprice. Mercaptan ... Mercaptan.... She wondered what the P.
stood for. Peter, Philip, Patrick, Pendennis even? She could hardly
have guessed that Mr. Mercaptan’s father, the eminent bacteriologist,
had insisted, thirty-four years ago, on calling his first-born
‘Pasteur.’</p>

<p>A little tremulous, under her outward elegant calm, Rosie mounted
the stairs. Twenty-five steps to the first floor—one flight of
thirteen, which was rather disagreeably ominous, and one of twelve.
Then two flights of eleven, and she was on the second landing,
facing a front door, a bell-push like a round eye, a brass name-plate.
For a great lady thoroughly accustomed to this sort of thing,
she felt her heart beating rather unpleasantly fast. It was those
stairs, no doubt. She halted a moment, took two deep breaths,
then pushed the bell.</p>

<p>The door was opened by an aged servant of the most forbiddingly
respectable appearance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mercaptan at home?"</p>

<p>The person at the door burst at once into a long, rambling, angry
complaint, but precisely about what Rosie could not for certain
make out. Mr. Mercaptan had left orders, she gathered, that he
wasn’t to be disturbed. But some one had come and disturbed him,
"fairly shoved his way in, so rude and inconsiderate," all the
same. And now he’d been once disturbed, she didn’t see why he
shouldn’t be disturbed again. But she didn’t know what things
were coming to if people fairly shoved their way in like that.
Bolshevism, she called it.</p>

<p>Rosie murmured her sympathies, and was admitted into a dark hall.
Still querulously denouncing the Bolsheviks who came shoving in,
the person led the way down a corridor and, throwing open a door,
announced, in a tone of grievance: "A lady to see you, Master
Paster"—for Mrs. Goldie was an old family retainer, and one of
the few who knew the Secret of Mr. Mercaptan’s Christian name,
one of the fewer still who were privileged to employ it. Then,
as soon as Rosie had stepped across the threshold, she cut off
her retreat with a bang and went off, muttering all the time,
towards her kitchen.</p>

<p>It certainly wasn’t a garret. Half a glance, the first whiff
of pot-pourri, the feel of the carpet beneath her feet, had been
enough to prove that. But it was not the room which occupied Rosie’s
attention, it was its occupants. One of them, thin, sharp-featured
and, in Rosie’s very young eyes, quite old, was standing with
an elbow on the mantelpiece. The other, sleeker and more genial
in appearance, was sitting in front of a writing-desk near the
window. And neither of them—Rosie glanced desperately from one
to the other, hoping vainly that she might have overlooked a blond
beard—neither of them was Toto.</p>

<p>The sleek man at the writing-desk got up, advanced to meet her.</p>

<p>"An unexpected pleasure," he said, in a voice that alternately
boomed and fluted. "<em>Too</em> delightful! But to what do I
owe——? <em>Who</em>, may I ask——?"</p>

<p>He had held out his hand; automatically Rosie proffered hers.
The sleek man shook it with cordiality, almost with tenderness.</p>

<p>"I ... I think I must have made a mistake," she said. "Mr. Mercaptan...?"</p>

<p>The sleek man smiled. "I am Mr. Mercaptan."</p>

<p>"You live on the second floor?"</p>

<p>"I never laid claims to being a mathematician," said the sleek
man, smiling as though to applaud himself, "but I have always
calculated that ..." he hesitated ... "<em>enfin, que ma demeure
se trouve, en effet</em>, on the second floor. Lypiatt will bear
me out, I’m sure." He turned to the thin man, who had not moved
from the fireplace, but had stood all the time motionlessly, his
elbow on the mantelpiece, looking gloomily at the ground.</p>

<p>Lypiatt looked up. "I must be going," he said abruptly. And he
walked towards the door. Like vermouth posters, like vermouth
posters!—so that was Myra’s piece of mockery! All his anger had
sunk like a quenched flame. He was altogether quenched, put out
with unhappiness.</p>

<p>Politely Mr. Mercaptan hurried across the room and opened the
door for him. "<em>Good</em>-bye, then," he said airily.</p>

<p>Lypiatt did not speak, but walked out into the hall. The front
door banged behind him.</p>

<p>"Well, <em>well</em>," said Mr. Mercaptan, coming back across
the room to where Rosie was still irresolutely standing. "Talk
about the <em>furor poeticus</em>! But <em>do</em> sit down, I
beg you. On Crébillon." He indicated the vast white satin sofa.
"I call it Crébillon," he explained, "because the soul of that
great writer undoubtedly tenants it, <em>undoubtedly</em>. You
know his book, of course? You know <em>Le Sopha</em>?"</p>

<p>Sinking into Crébillon’s soft lap, Rosie had to admit that she
didn’t know <em>Le Sopha</em>. She had begun to recover her self-possession.
If this wasn’t <em>the</em> young poet, it was certainly <em>a</em>
young poet. And a very peculiar one, too. As a great lady she
laughingly accepted the odd situation.</p>

<p>"Not know <em>Le Sopha</em>?" exclaimed Mr. Mercaptan. "Oh! but,
my dear and mysterious young lady, let me lend you a copy of it
at once. <em>No</em> education can be called <em>complete</em>
without a knowledge of that divine book." He darted to the bookshelf
and came back with a small volume bound in white vellum. "The
hero’s soul," he explained, handing her the volume, "passes, by
the laws of metempsychosis, into a sofa. He is doomed to remain
a sofa until such time as two persons consummate upon his bosom
their reciprocal and equal loves. The book is the record of the
poor sofa’s hopes and disappointments."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Rosie, looking at the title-page.</p>

<p>"But now," said Mr. Mercaptan, sitting down beside her on the
edge of Crébillon, "won’t you please explain? To what happy quiproquo
do I owe this sudden and altogether delightful invasion of my
privacy?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Rosie, and hesitated. It was really rather difficult
to explain. "I was to meet a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Mr. Mercaptan encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Who sent me a telegram," Rosie went on.</p>

<p>"He sent you a telegram!" Mr. Mercaptan echoed.</p>

<p>"Changing the—the place we had fixed and telling me to meet him
at this address."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>Rose nodded. "On the s—second floor," she made it more precise.</p>

<p>"But <em>I</em> live on the second floor," said Mr. Mercaptan.
"You don’t mean to say your friend is also called Mercaptan and
lives here too?"</p>

<p>Rosie smiled. "I don’t know what he’s called," she said with
a cool ironical carelessness that was genuinely <em>grande dame</em>.</p>

<p>"You don’t know his name?" Mr. Mercaptan gave a roar and a squeal
of delighted laughter. "But that’s <em>too</em> good," he said.</p>

<p>"S—second floor, he wrote in the telegram." Rosie was now perfectly
at her ease. "When I saw your name, I thought it was his name.
I must say," she added, looking sideways at Mr. Mercaptan and
at once dropping the magnolia petals of her eyelids, "it seemed
to me a very charming name."</p>

<p>"You overwhelm me," said Mr. Mercaptan, smiling all over his
cheerful, snouty face. "As for <em>your</em> name—I am too discreet
a <em>galantuomo</em> to ask. And, in any case, what <em>does</em>
it matter? A rose by any other name...."</p>

<p>"But, as a matter of fact," she said, raising and lowering once
again her smooth, white lids, "my name does happen to be Rose;
or, at any rate, Rosie."</p>

<p>"So you are sweet by right!" exclaimed Mr. Mercaptan, with a
pretty gallantry which he was the first to appreciate. "Let’s
order tea on the strength of it." He jumped up and rang the bell.
"How I congratulate myself on this astonishing piece of good fortune!"</p>

<p>Rosie said nothing. This Mr. Mercaptan, she thought, seemed to
be even more a man of the great artistic world than Toto.</p>

<p>"What puzzles me," he went on, "is why your anonymous friend
should have chosen my address out of all the millions of others.
He must know me, or, at any rate, know about me."</p>

<p>"I should imagine," said Rosie, "that you have a lot of friends."</p>

<p>Mr. Mercaptan laughed—the whole orchestra, from bassoon to piccolo.
"<em>Des amis, des amies</em>—with and without the mute ‘e,’"
he declared.</p>

<p>The aged and forbidding servant appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"Tea for two, Mrs. Goldie."</p>

<p>Mrs. Goldie looked round the room suspiciously. "The other gentleman’s
gone, has he?" she asked. And having assured herself of his absence,
she renewed her complaint. "Shoving in like that," she said. "Bolshevism,
that’s what I——"</p>

<p>"All right, all right, Mrs. Goldie. Let’s have our tea as quickly
as possible." Mr. Mercaptan held up his hand, authoritatively,
with the gesture of a policeman controlling the traffic.</p>

<p>"Very well, Master Paster." Mrs. Goldie spoke with resignation
and departed.</p>

<p>"But tell me," Mr. Mercaptan went on, "if it <em>isn’t</em> indiscreet—what
does your friend look like?"</p>

<p>"W—well," Rosie answered, "he’s fair, and though he’s quite young
he wears a beard." With her two hands she indicated on her own
unemphatic bosom the contours of Toto’s broad blond fan.</p>

<p>"A beard! But, good heavens," Mr. Mercaptan slapped his thigh,
"it’s Coleman, it’s obviously and undoubtedly Coleman!"</p>

<p>"Well, whoever it was," said Rosie severely, "he played a very
stupid sort of joke."</p>

<p>"For which I thank him. <em>De tout mon cœur.</em>"</p>

<p>Rosie smiled and looked sideways. "All the same," she said, "I
shall give him a piece of my mind."</p>

<p>Poor Aunt Aggie! Oh, poor Aunt Aggie, indeed! In the light of
Mr. Mercaptan’s boudoir her hammered copper and her leadless glaze
certainly did look a bit comical.</p>

<p>After tea Mr. Mercaptan played cicerone in a tour of inspection
round the room. They visited the papier mâché writing-desk, the
Condor fans, the Marie Laurencin, the 1914 edition of <em>Du Côté
de chez Swann</em>, the Madonna that probably was a fake, the
nigger mask, the Chelsea figures, the Chinese object of art in
sculptured crystal, the scale model of Queen Victoria in wax under
a glass bell. Toto, it became clear, had been no more than a forerunner;
the definitive revelation was Mr. Mercaptan’s. Yes, poor Aunt
Aggie! And indeed, when Mr. Mercaptan began to read her his little
middle on the "Droit du Seigneur," it was poor everybody. Poor
mother, with her absurd, old-fashioned, prudish views; poor, earnest
father, with his Unitarianism, his <em>Hibbert Journal</em>, his
letters to the papers about the necessity for a spiritual regeneration.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" she cried from the depths of Crébillon. She was leaning
back in one corner, languid, serpentine, and at ease, her feet
in their mottled snake’s leather tucked up under her. "Bravo!"
she cried as Mr. Mercaptan finished his reading and looked up
for his applause.</p>

<p>Mr. Mercaptan bowed.</p>

<p>"You express so exquisitely what we——" and waving her hand in
a comprehensive gesture, she pictured to herself all the other
fastidious ladies, all the marchionesses of fable, reclining,
as she herself at this moment reclined, on upholstery of white
satin, "what we all only feel and aren’t clever enough to say."</p>

<p>Mr. Mercaptan was charmed. He got up from before his writing-desk,
crossed the room and sat down beside her on Crébillon. "Feeling,"
he said, "is the im_port_ant thing."</p>

<p>Rosie remembered that her father had once remarked, in blank
verse: ‘The things that matter happen in the heart.’</p>

<p>"I quite agree," she said.</p>

<p>Like movable raisins in the suet of his snouty face, Mr. Mercaptan’s
brown little eyes rolled amorous avowals. He took Rosie’s hand
and kissed it. Crébillon creaked discreetly as he moved a little
nearer.</p>

<p>It was only the evening of the same day. Rosie lay on her sofa—a
poor, hire-purchase thing indeed, compared with Mr. Mercaptan’s
grand affair in white satin and carved and gilded wood, but still
a sofa—lay with her feet on the arm of it and her long suave legs
exposed, by the slipping of the kimono, to the top of her stretched
stockings. She was reading the little vellum-jacketed volume of
Crébillon, which Mr. Mercaptan had given her when he said ‘good-bye’
(or rather, ‘<em>À bientôt, mon amie</em>’); given, not lent,
as he had less generously offered at the beginning of their afternoon;
given with the most graceful of allusive dedications inscribed
on the fly-leaf:</p>

She thought of the essay on the "Jus Primæ Noctis"—ah! what we’ve
all been feeling and none of us clever enough to say. We on the
sofas, ruthless, lovely and fastidious....</p>

<p>"I am proud to constitute myself"—Mr. Mercaptan had said of it—"<em>l’esprit
d’escalier des dames galantes</em>."</p>

<p>Rosie was not quite sure what he meant; but it certainly sounded
very witty indeed.</p>

<p>She read the book slowly. Her French, indeed, wasn’t good enough
to permit her to read it anyhow else. She wished it were better.
Perhaps it if were better she wouldn’t be yawning like this. It
was disgraceful: she pulled herself together. Mr. Mercaptan had
said that, it was a masterpiece.</p>

<p>In his study, Shearwater was trying to write his paper on the
regulative functions of the kidneys. He was not succeeding.</p>

<p>Why wouldn’t she see me yesterday? he kept wondering. With anguish
he suspected other lovers; desired her, in consequence, the more.
Gumbril had said something, he remembered, that night they had
met her by the coffee-stall. What was it? He wished now that he
had listened more attentively.</p>

<p>She’s bored with me. Already. It was obvious.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was too rustic for her. Shearwater looked at his hands.
Yes, the nails <em>were</em> dirty. He took an orange stick out
of his waistcoat pocket and began to clean them. He had bought
a whole packet of orange sticks that morning.</p>

<p>Determinedly he took up his pen. "The hydrogen ion concentration
in the blood ..." he began a new paragraph. But he got no further
than the first seven words.</p>

<p>If, he began thinking with a frightful confusion, if—if—if——
Past conditionals, hopelessly past. He might have been brought
up more elegantly; his father, for example, might have been a
barrister instead of a barrister’s clerk. He mightn’t have had
to work so hard when he was young; might have been about more,
danced more, seen more young women. If he had met her years ago—during
the war, should one say, dressed in the uniform of a lieutenant
in the Guards....</p>

<p>He had pretended that he wasn’t interested in women; that they
had no effect on him; that, in fact, he was above that sort of
thing. Imbecile! He might as well have said that he was above
having a pair of kidneys. He had only consented to admit, graciously,
that they were a physiological necessity.</p>

<p>O God, what a fool he had been!</p>

<p>And then, what about Rosie? What sort of a life had she been
having while he was being above that sort of thing? Now he came
to think of it, he really knew nothing about her, except that
she had been quite incapable of learning correctly, even by heart,
the simplest facts about the physiology of frogs. Having found
that out, he had really given up exploring further. How could
he have been so stupid?</p>

<p>Rosie had been in love with him, he supposed. Had he been in
love with her? No. He had taken care not to be. On principle.
He had married her as a measure of intimate hygiene; out of protective
affection, too, certainly out of affection; and a little for amusement,
as one might buy a puppy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash had opened his eyes; seeing her, he had also begun
to notice Rosie. It seemed to him that he had been a loutish cad
as well as an imbecile.</p>

<p>What should he do about it? He sat for a long time wondering.</p>

<p>In the end he decided that the best thing would be to go and
tell Rosie all about it, all about everything.</p>

<p>About Mrs. Viveash too? Yes, about Mrs. Viveash too. He would
get over Mrs. Viveash more easily and more rapidly if he did.
And he would begin to try and find out about Rosie. He would explore
her. He would discover all the other things besides an incapacity
to learn physiology that were in her. He would discover her, he
would quicken his affection for her into something livelier and
more urgent. And they would begin again; more satisfactorily this
time; with knowledge and understanding; wise from their experience.</p>

<p>Shearwater got up from his chair before the writing-table, lurched
pensively towards the door, bumping into the revolving bookcase
and the arm-chair as he went, and walked down the passage to the
drawing-room. Rosie did not turn her head as he came in, but went
on reading without changing her position, her slippered feet still
higher than her head, her legs still charmingly avowing themselves.</p>

<p>Shearwater came to a halt in front of the empty fireplace. He
stood there with his back to it, as though warming himself before
an imaginary flame. It was, he felt, the safest, the most strategic
point from which to talk.</p>

<p>"What are you reading?" he asked.</p>

<p>"<em>Le Sopha</em>," said Rosie.</p>

<p>"What’s that?"</p>

<p>"What’s that?" Rosie scornfully echoed. "Why, it’s one of the
great French classics."</p>

<p>"Who by?"</p>

<p>"Crébillon the younger."</p>

<p>"Never heard of him," said Shearwater. There was a silence. Rosie
went on reading.</p>

<p>"It just occurred to me," Shearwater began again in his rather
ponderous, infelicitous way, "that you mightn’t be very happy,
Rosie."</p>

<p>Rosie looked up at him and laughed. "What put that into your
head?" she asked. "<em>I</em>’m perfectly happy."</p>

<p>Shearwater was left a little at a loss. "Well, I’m very glad
to hear it," he said. "I only thought ... that perhaps <em>you</em>
might think ... that <em>I</em> rather neglected you."</p>

<p>Rosie laughed again. "What is all this about?" she said.</p>

<p>"I have it rather on my conscience," said Shearwater. "I begin
to see ... something has made me see ... that I’ve not.... I don’t
treat you very well...."</p>

<p>"But I don’t n—notice it, I assure you," put in Rosie, still
smiling.</p>

<p>"I leave you out too much," Shearwater went on with a kind of
desperation, running his fingers through his thick brown hair.
"We don’t share enough together. You’re too much outside my life."</p>

<p>"But after all," said Rosie, "we are a civ—vilized couple. We
don’t want to live in one another’s pockets, do we?"</p>

<p>"No, but we’re really no more than strangers," said Shearwater.
"That isn’t right. And it’s my fault. I’ve never tried to get
into touch with your life. But you did your best to understand
mine ... at the beginning of our marriage."</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>then—n</em>!" said Rosie, laughing. "You found out what
a little idiot I was."</p>

<p>"Don’t make a joke of it," said Shearwater. "It isn’t a joke.
It’s very serious. I tell you, I’ve come to see how stupid and
inconsiderate and un-understanding I’ve been with you. I’ve come
to see quite suddenly. The fact is," he went on with a rush, like
an uncorked fountain, "I’ve been seeing a woman recently whom
I like very much, and who doesn’t like me." Speaking of Mrs. Viveash,
unconsciously he spoke her language. For Mrs. Viveash people always
euphemistically ‘liked’ one another rather a lot, even when it
was a case of the most frightful and excruciating passion, the
most complete abandonments. "And somehow that’s made me see a
lot of things which I’d been blind to before—blind deliberately,
I suppose. It’s made me see, among other things, that I’ve really
been to blame towards you, Rosie."</p>

<p>Rosie listened with an astonishment which she perfectly disguised.
So James was embarking on his little affairs, was he? It seemed
incredible, and also, as she looked at her husband’s face—the
face behind its bristlingly manly mask of a harassed baby—also
rather pathetically absurd. She wondered who it could be. But
she displayed no curiosity. She would find out soon enough.</p>

<p>"I’m sorry you should have been unhappy about it," she said.</p>

<p>"It’s finished now." Shearwater made a decided little gesture.</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" said Rosie. "You should persevere." She looked at him,
smiling.</p>

<p>Shearwater was taken aback by this display of easy detachment.
He had imagined the conversation so very differently, as something
so serious, so painful and, at the same time, so healing and soothing,
that he did not know how to go on. "But I thought," he said hesitatingly,
"that you ... that we ... after this experience ... I would try
to get closer to you...." (Oh, it sounded ridiculous!) ... "We
might start again, from a different place, so to speak."</p>

<p>"But, <em>cher ami</em>," protested Rosie, with the inflection
and in the preferred tongue of Mr. Mercaptan, "you can’t seriously
expect us to do the Darby and Joan business, can you? You’re distressing
yourself quite unnecessarily on my account. I don’t find you neglect
me or anything like it. You have your life—naturally. And I have
mine. We don’t get in one another’s way."</p>

<p>"But do you think that’s the ideal sort of married life?" asked
Shearwater.</p>

<p>"It’s obviously the most civ—vilized," Rosie answered, laughing.</p>

<p>Confronted by Rosie’s civilization, Shearwater felt helpless.</p>

<p>"Well, if you don’t want," he said. "I’d hoped ... I’d thought...."</p>

<p>He went back to his study to think things over. The more he thought
them over, the more he blamed himself. And incessantly the memory
of Mrs. Viveash tormented him. </p>
