<p>"One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;glide!" said Professor Bartet,
emphasizing his instructions by a brisk collision of his palms
at "glide." "One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;glide!"</p>

<p>The school week was over, at last, but Penrod's troubles were
not.</p>

<p>Round and round the ballroom went the seventeen struggling little
couples of the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class. Round and round
went their reflections with them, swimming rhythmically in the
polished, dark floor&mdash;white and blue and pink for the girls; black,
with dabs of white, for the white-collared, white-gloved boys;
and sparks and slivers of high light everywhere as the glistening
pumps flickered along the surface like a school of flying fish.
Every small pink face&mdash;with one exception&mdash;was painstaking and
set for duty. It was a conscientious little merry-go-round.</p>

<p>"One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;glide! One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;glide!
One-two-th &mdash;Ha! Mister Penrod Schofield, you lose the step.
Your left foot! No, no! This is the left! See&mdash;like me! Now again!
One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;glide! Better! Much better! Again!
One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;gl &mdash;Stop! Mr. Penrod Schofield,
this dancing class is provided by the kind parents of the pupilses
as much to learn the mannerss of good societies as to dance. You
think you shall ever see a gentleman in good societies to tickle
his partner in the dance till she say Ouch? Never! I assure you
it is not done. Again! Now then! Piano, please! One-two-three;
one-two-three&mdash;glide! Mr. Penrod Schofield, your right foot&mdash;your
right foot! No, no! Stop!"</p>

<p>The merry-go-round came to a standstill.</p>

<p>"Mr. Penrod Schofield and partner" &mdash;Professor Bartet wiped
his brow&mdash;"will you kindly observe me? One-two-three&mdash;glide! So!
Now then&mdash;no; you will please keep your places, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Penrod Schofield, I would puttickly like your attention, this
is for you!"</p>

<p>"Pickin' on me again!" murmured the smouldering Penrod to his
small, unsympathetic partner. "Can't let me alone a minute!"</p>

<p>"Mister Georgie Bassett, please step to the centre," said the
professor.</p>

<p>Mr. Bassett complied with modest alacrity.</p>

<p>"Teacher's pet!" whispered Penrod hoarsely. He had nothing but
contempt for Georgie Bassett. The parents, guardians, aunts, uncles,
cousins, governesses, housemaids, cooks, chauffeurs and coachmen,
appertaining to the members of the dancing class, all dwelt in
the same part of town and shared certain communal theories; and
among the most firmly established was that which maintained Georgie
Bassett to be the Best Boy in Town. Contrariwise, the unfortunate
Penrod, largely because of his recent dazzling but disastrous
attempts to control forces far beyond him, had been given a clear
title as the Worst Boy in Town. (Population, 135,000.) To precisely
what degree his reputation was the product of his own energies
cannot be calculated. It was Marjorie Jones who first applied
the description, in its definite simplicity, the day after the
"pageant," and, possibly, her frequent and effusive repetitions
of it, even upon wholly irrelevant occasions, had something to
do with its prompt and quite perfect acceptance by the community.</p>

<p>"Miss Rennsdale will please do me the fafer to be Mr. Georgie
Bassett's partner for one moment," said Professor Bartet. "Mr.
Penrod Schofield will please give his attention. Miss Rennsdale
and Mister Bassett, obliche me, if you please. Others please watch.
Piano, please! Now then!"</p>

<p>Miss Rennsdale, aged eight&mdash;the youngest lady in the class&mdash;and
Mr. Georgie Bassett one-two-three&mdash;glided with consummate technique
for the better education of Penrod Schofield. It is possible that
amber-curled, beautiful Marjorie felt that she, rather than Miss
Rennsdale, might have been selected as the example of perfection&mdash;or
perhaps her remark was only woman.</p>

<p>"Stopping everybody for that boy!" said Marjorie.</p>

<p>Penrod, across the circle from her, heard distinctly&mdash;nay, he
was obviously intended to hear; but over a scorched heart he preserved
a stoic front. Whereupon Marjorie whispered derisively in the
ear of her partner, Maurice Levy, who wore a pearl pin in his
tie.</p>

<p>"Again, please, everybody&mdash;ladies and gentlemen!" cried Professor
Bartet. "Mister Penrod Schofield, if you please, pay puttickly
attention! Piano, please! Now then!"</p>

<p>The lesson proceeded. At the close of the hour Professor Bartet
stepped to the centre of the room and clapped his hands for attention.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, if you please to seat yourselves quietly,"
he said; "I speak to you now about to-morrow. As you all know
&mdash;Mister Penrod Schofield, I am not sticking up in a tree
outside that window! If you do me the fafer to examine I am here,
insides of the room. Now then! Piano, pl&mdash;no, I do not wish the
piano! As you all know, this is the last lesson of the season
until next October. Tomorrow is our special afternoon; beginning
three o'clock, we dance the cotillon. But this afternoon comes
the test of mannerss. You must see if each know how to make a
little formal call like a grown-up people in good societies. You
have had good, perfect instruction; let us see if we know how
to perform like societies ladies and gentlemen twenty-six years
of age.</p>

<p>"Now, when you're dismissed each lady will go to her home and
prepare to receive a call. The gentlemen will allow the ladies
time to reach their houses and to prepare to receive callers;
then each gentleman will call upon a lady and beg the pleasure
to engage her for a partner in the cotillon to-morrow. You all
know the correct, proper form for these calls, because didn't
I work teaching you last lesson till I thought I would drop dead?
Yes! Now each gentleman, if he reach a lady's house behind some-other
gentleman, then he must go somewhere else to a lady's house, and
keep calling until he secures a partner; so, as there are the
same number of both, everybody shall have a partner.</p>

<p>"Now please all remember that if in case &mdash;Mister Penrod
Schofield, when you make your call on a lady I beg you to please
remember that gentlemen in good societies do not scratch the back
in societies as you appear to attempt; so please allow the hands
to rest carelessly in the lap. Now please all remember that if
in case &mdash;Mister Penrod Schofield, if you please! Gentlemen
in societies do not scratch the back by causing frictions between
it and the back of your chair, either! Nobody else is itching
here! <em>I</em> do not itch! I cannot talk if you must itch!
In the name of Heaven, why must you always itch? What was I saying?
Where ah! the cotillon&mdash;yes! For the cotillon it is important
nobody shall fail to be here tomorrow; but if any one should be
so very ill he cannot possible come he must write a very polite
note of regrets in the form of good societies to his engaged partner
to excuse himself&mdash;and he must give the reason.</p>

<p>"I do not think anybody is going to be that sick to-morrow&mdash;no;
and I will find out and report to parents if anybody would try
it and not be. But it is important for the cotillon that we have
an even number of so many couples, and if it should happen that
someone comes and her partner has sent her a polite note that
he has genuine reasons why he cannot come, the note must be handed
at once to me, so that I arrange some other partner. Is all understood?
Yes. The gentlemen will remember now to allow the ladies plenty
of time to reach their houses and prepare to receive calls. Ladies
and gentlemen, I thank you for your polite attention."</p>

<p>It was nine blocks to the house of Marjorie Jones; but Penrod
did it in less than seven minutes from a flying start&mdash;such was
his haste to lay himself and his hand for the cotillon at the
feet of one who had so recently spoken unamiably of him in public.
He had not yet learned that the only safe male rebuke to a scornful
female is to stay away from her&mdash;especially if that is what she
desires. However, he did not wish to rebuke her; simply and ardently
he wished to dance the cotillon with her. Resentment was swallowed
up in hope.</p>

<p>The fact that Miss Jones' feeling for him bore a striking resemblance
to that of Simon Legree for Uncle Tom, deterred him not at all.
Naturally, he was not wholly unconscious that when he should lay
his hand for the cotillon at her feet it would be her inward desire
to step on it; but he believed that if he were first in the field
Marjorie would have to accept. These things are governed by law.</p>

<p>It was his fond intention to reach her house even in advance
of herself, and with grave misgiving he beheld a large automobile
at rest before the sainted gate. Forthwith, a sinking feeling
became a portent inside him as little Maurice Levy emerged from
the front door of the house.</p>

<p>"'Lo, Penrod!" said Maurice airily.</p>

<p>"What you doin' in there?" inquired Penrod.</p>

<p>"In where?"</p>

<p>"In Marjorie's."</p>

<p>"Well, what shouldn't I be doin' in Marjorie's?" Mr. Levy returned
indignantly. "I was inviting her for my partner in the cotillon&mdash;what
you s'pose?"</p>

<p>"You haven't got any right to!" Penrod protested hotly. "You
can't do it yet."</p>

<p>"I did do it yet!" said Maurice.</p>

<p>"You can't!" insisted Penrod. "You got to allow them time first.
He said the ladies had to be allowed time to prepare."</p>

<p>"Well, ain't she had time to prepare?"</p>

<p>"When?" Penrod demanded, stepping close to his rival threateningly.
"I'd like to know when&#11834;"</p>

<p>"When?" echoed the other with shrill triumph. "When? Why, in
mamma's sixty-horse powder limousine automobile, what Marjorie
came home with me in! I guess that's when!"</p>

<p>An impulse in the direction of violence became visible upon the
countenance of Penrod.</p>

<p>"I expect you need some wiping down," he began dangerously. "I'll
give you sumpthing to remem&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you will!" Maurice cried with astonishing truculence, contorting
himself into what he may have considered a posture of defense.
"Let's see you try it, you&mdash;you itcher!"</p>

<p>For the moment, defiance from such a source was dumfounding.
Then, luckily, Penrod recollected something and glanced at the
automobile.</p>

<p>Perceiving therein not only the alert chauffeur but the magnificent
outlines of Mrs. Levy, his enemy's mother, he manoeuvred his lifted
hand so that it seemed he had but meant to scratch his ear.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I better be goin'," he said casually. "See you
tomorrow!"</p>

<p>Maurice mounted to the lap of luxury, and Penrod strolled away
with an assumption of careless ease which was put to a severe
strain when, from the rear window of the car, a sudden protuberance
in the nature of a small, dark, curly head shrieked scornfully:</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;you big stiff!"</p>

<p>The cotillon loomed dismally before Penrod now; but it was his
duty to secure a partner and he set about it with a dreary heart.
The delay occasioned by his fruitless attempt on Marjorie and
the altercation with his enemy at her gate had allowed other ladies
ample time to prepare for callers&mdash;and to receive them. Sadly
he went from house to house, finding that he had been preceded
in one after the other. Altogether his hand for the cotillon was
declined eleven times that afternoon on the legitimate ground
of previous engagement. This, with Marjorie, scored off all except
five of the seventeen possible partners; and four of the five
were also sealed away from him, as he learned in chance encounters
with other boys upon the street.</p>

<p>One lady alone remained; he bowed to the inevitable and entered
this lorn damsel's gate at twilight with an air of great discouragement.
The lorn damsel was Miss Rennsdale, aged eight.</p>

<p>We are apt to forget that there are actually times of life when
too much youth is a handicap. Miss Rennsdale was beautiful; she
danced like a premiere; she had every charm but age. On that account
alone had she been allowed so much time to prepare to receive
callers that it was only by the most manful efforts she could
keep her lip from trembling.</p>

<p>A decorous maid conducted the long-belated applicant to her where
she sat upon a sofa beside a nursery governess. The decorous maid
announced him composedly as he made his entrance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Penrod Schofield!"</p>

<p>Miss Rennsdale suddenly burst into loud sobs.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she wailed. "I just knew it would be him!"</p>

<p>The decorous maid's composure vanished at once&mdash;likewise her
decorum. She clapped her hand over her mouth and fled, uttering
sounds. The governess, however, set herself to comfort her heartbroken
charge, and presently succeeded in restoring Miss Rennsdale to
a semblance of that poise with which a lady receives callers and
accepts invitations to dance cotillons. But she continued to sob
at intervals.</p>

<p>Feeling himself at perhaps a disadvantage, Penrod made offer
of his hand for the morrow with a little embarrassment. Following
the form prescribed by Professor Bartet, he advanced several paces
toward the stricken lady and bowed formally.</p>

<p>"I hope," he said by rote, "you're well, and your parents also
in good health. May I have the pleasure of dancing the cotillon
as your partner t'-morrow afternoon?"</p>

<p>The wet eyes of Miss Rennsdale searched his countenance without
pleasure, and a shudder wrung her small shoulders; but the governess
whispered to her instructively, and she made a great effort.</p>

<p>"I thu-thank you fu-for your polite invu-invu-invutation; and
I ac&#11834;"  Thus far she progressed when emotion overcame her again.
She beat frantically upon the sofa with fists and heels. "Oh,
I <em>DID </em>want it to be Georgie Bassett!"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" said the governess, and whispered urgently, whereupon
Miss Rennsdale was able to complete her acceptance.</p>

<p>"And I ac-accept wu-with pu-pleasure!" she moaned, and immediately,
uttering a loud yell, flung herself face downward upon the sofa,
clutching her governess convulsively.</p>

<p>Somewhat disconcerted, Penrod bowed again.</p>

<p>"I thank you for your polite acceptance," he murmured hurriedly;
"and I trust&mdash;I trust&mdash;I forget. Oh, yes &mdash;I trust we shall
have a most enjoyable occasion. Pray present my compliments to
your parents; and I must now wish you a very good afternoon."</p>

<p>Concluding these courtly demonstrations with another bow he withdrew
in fair order, though thrown into partial confusion in the hall
by a final wail from his crushed hostess:</p>

<p>"Oh! Why couldn't it be anybody but <em>HIM</em>!"</p>
