<p>Ferdinand Frog did not like Timothy Turtle. But he always said he
thought Mr. Turtle could be <u>trusted</u>.
</p>
<p>"You can <u>depend</u> on him," Mr. Frog often remarked. "Yes, you can depend
on him to grab you if he ever gets a chance."
</p><p>And all the rest of the musical Frog family agreed with him.
</p><p>It is not surprising, therefore, that they never invited Timothy Turtle
to attend their singing parties in Cedar Swamp. It made no difference
how much Timothy Turtle hinted. Though he frequently took pains to tell
Ferdinand Frog how fond he was of music, Mr. Frog never once asked him
to come to a concert.
</p><p>In private Mr. Frog and his friends often spoke of Mr. Turtle--and
giggled. And one of the Frog family even made up a song about Timothy
Turtle, which the whole company loved to chant in Cedar Swamp, safe--as
they thought--from Timothy's snapping jaws.
</p><p>But one fine summer's evening they had a great surprise. They had
scarcely begun their nightly concert when Timothy Turtle appeared, out
of the water and crawled upon an old stump, right in their midst.
</p><p>"Good evening!" he cried. "I was just passing on my way home; and
hearing the singing, I thought I'd stop and enjoy it."
</p><p>For a few moments none of the Frog family said a word. And then
Ferdinand Frog spoke up and asked Mr. Turtle a question:
</p><p>"Have you had your dinner?"
</p><p>"No, I haven't," Timothy answered. "But you needn't trouble yourselves
on my account. Go on with your singing. And if I feel faint no doubt I
can find a bite to eat hereabouts."
</p><p>Now, Mr. Turtle hoped that his speech would put the singers quite at
their ease. But they looked at one another and rolled their eyes as if
to say, "This Timothy Turtle is a dangerous person. Look out for him!"
</p><p>At the same time they did not wish to appear frightened. And Ferdinand
Frog's mother's uncle even made a short speech, saying that he hoped Mr.
Turtle would enjoy the singing half as much as everybody else enjoyed
his company.
</p><p>He was about to make some further remark. But no one knew what. For
Timothy Turtle wheeled about to look at the old gentleman. And the
moment Timothy moved, Ferdinand Frog's mother's uncle jumped hastily
into the water from the hummock where he had been sitting, and swam
away.
</p><p>The rest of the company then sang a song. And their listener said that
he had never heard anything like it.
</p><p>"I wish you'd sing it again," he said, "with your mouths open and your
eyes shut."
</p><p>But the musical Frog family objected that they were not used to singing
in that fashion.
</p><p>"Why don't you keep your own eyes shut?" Ferdinand Frog asked Mr.
Turtle. "Then you wouldn't know whether ours were open or closed."
</p><p>"Let us <u>all</u> shut our eyes!" Timothy Turtle then suggested. And when
the Frog family began another song, a few of the younger and more
foolish singers followed Mr. Turtle's advice.
</p><p>So, too, did Mr. Turtle himself--<u>for a few moments</u>.
</p><p>But he soon opened his eyes slyly. And he became very angry when he saw
that most of the singers were watching him.
</p><p>"You aren't doing as I asked you!" he shouted.
