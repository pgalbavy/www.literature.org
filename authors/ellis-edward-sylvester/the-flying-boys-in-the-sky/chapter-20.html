<p>Harvey Hamilton was astounded. In all his imaginings he had never
dreamed of this explanation of the destruction of his aeroplane.
One admirable trait of the thick-witted Bohunkus Johnson was his
truthfulness. His friend knew he was not trying to deceive him
and what he had told could be accepted as fact.</p>

<p>"Why did you wait so long, Bunk, before telling me this story?"</p>

<p>"Wal, Harv, I didn’t want to ’bleve it myself; I didn’t at first,—dat
is, I didn’t think de Perfesser was as mean as all dat, but it
was him and no mistake."</p>

<p>"I am sure you are right, though I can’t understand why he should
do such a thing."</p>

<p>"Guess he war jealous ob us."</p>

<p>"Possibly so, but even then it is hard to understand."</p>

<p>Harvey still refrained from giving the obvious explanation that
presented itself. A man who is mentally unbalanced cannot be held
accountable for his acts. It was impossible to feel the resentment
toward Professor Morgan which he would have felt had the man been
in his right mind. Harvey sighed.</p>

<p>"Only one thing remains for us to do, Bunk."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Go home and give up our outing. Hist! some one is coming."</p>

<p>Footsteps were heard ascending the stairs. Whoever the person
was, he came with deliberate tread along the hall, and halting
in front of the door, knocked smartly. Harvey sprang to his feet
and opened. The landlord stood before him.</p>

<p>"Here’s a telegram for you; I signed; nothing to pay."</p>

<p>The wondering youth accepted the yellow envelope and tore it
open. He read:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"Go to Groveton and wait. You will learn something to your<br/>
advantage."

</p>
<p>
"<em>GABRIEL HAMILTON</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>The message was dated at his father’s place of business in New
York, and as shown was signed by him.</p>

<p>"There is no answer," said Harvey to the waiting landlord, who
departed.</p>

<p>"This is beyond me," he remarked after reading the telegram to
Bohunkus, who of course was as much mystified as his companion.
"Why we should go to Groveton and what is there that can be of
advantage to me, is a greater puzzle than the wrecking of the
aeroplane."</p>

<p>"What am yo’ gwine to do, Harv?"</p>

<p>"Obey orders. Come on."</p>

<p>The two traveled with so light baggage that they had only to
fling their extra coats over their arms, the few minor articles
being in their pockets, and descend the stairs. Harvey paid his
bill and explained that he had been called suddenly away by the
telegram from his father, but it was possible he might return.
The landlord expressed his sympathy for the loss of the aeroplane
and promised to do all he could to find out who the criminals
were.</p>

<p>"Don’t bother," said Harvey airily, "it’s lucky it didn’t happen
when we were a mile or two up in the sky."</p>

<p>"I understand that you will pay a reward of two hundred dollars
for the detection of the scamps?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the offer stands," replied Harvey, confident that the really
guilty individual would never be discovered. "You have my address
on your register; if you learn anything, write or telegraph me.
By the way, how far is Groveton from here?"</p>

<p>"Twelve miles by railroad."</p>

<p>"Is it much of a town?"</p>

<p>"Not quite as big as Chesterton."</p>

<p>"What time can we leave for the place?"</p>

<p>The landlord glanced at the clock behind him.</p>

<p>"If you walk briskly you can catch the next train."</p>

<p>Harvey engaged the man to take care of the remains of the aeroplane
during his absence, and having been directed as to the right course,
the two hurried along the single street and turned off to the
station on their right. They were just in time to buy tickets
and take their seats. Their course was to the westward, which
was the direction of the wide valley between the mountainous ridges.
Twenty minutes later they stepped out on the platform and inquired
the name of the nearest hotel. As in the town they had just left,
there was only one hostelry, the Rawlins Hotel, to which they
made their way.</p>

<p>Wondering and perplexed to the last degree, Harvey entered the
place of board and lodging. He explained that he did not know
how long he would stay, and as it was only the middle of the forenoon,
he did not register, saying he would do so at noon, in the event
of his remaining that long.</p>

<p>The day was so pleasant—the prophecy of the weather prophet having
been fulfilled to the letter—that they sat down on the long bench
which ran along the front of the hotel, and waited for whatever
might turn up.</p>

<p>"If any one is to meet me, he would come here," reflected Harvey;
"I can’t imagine who he is or what news he will bring, but I shall
learn in due time."</p>

<p>A half hour later, while the two were seated side by side, occasionally
making a guess as to what it all meant, which guess both knew
was wide of the mark, Bohunkus said:</p>

<p>"Seems to me dem folks out dere am looking at something."</p>

<p>Excitement was fast spreading through the town. Groups stood
on the corners, halted in the middle of the street and at every
coign of advantage. All were peering into the sky, where some
object attracted their attention. Naturally Harvey and Bohunkus
rose from their seats and passed out to the front where their
view was clear.</p>

<p>"Gee! it am anoder airyplane!" exclaimed the negro.</p>

<p>"You are right; they seem to be growing plentiful in this part
of the world."</p>

<p>"Wonder if it am de Perfesser."</p>

<p>Harvey whipped his binoculars around and leveled them at the
object, whose outstretched wings identified it as one of the most
modern ships of the air. A brief scrutiny showed that it was not
the extraordinary invention of that extraordinary man who had
crossed their path more than once. It was a biplane, and though
still a considerable distance away the noise of its motor was
audible. It was traveling fast and heading for the little town
of Groveton.</p>

<p>It was evident that whoever was guiding the aerial craft was
an expert. Harvey saw that it carried only the operator, who described
a large circle over the town at a height of nearly a thousand
feet and then began descending.</p>

<p>"He’s gwine to land here!" exclaimed Bunk.</p>

<p>"And has picked out his spot," added Harvey.</p>

<p>Such proved to be the fact. There was a broad, open space in
front of the Rawlins House, where a large number of teams could
find room, the area being such as to offer an ideal spot for the
landing of an aeroplane. The aviator, who was now seen to be a
youth not much if any older than Harvey himself, guided his machine
with consummate skill, and lightly touched the ground within fifty
feet of where our young friends and half a hundred others were
standing. The aeroplane ran a few yards on its wheels, and then
came to a halt. The young man stepped lightly to the ground and
smilingly greeted the crowd. His next words were:</p>

<p>"I am looking for Harvey Hamilton and his colored companion."</p>

<p>"Dat’s us," whispered the startled Bohunkus.</p>

<p>Harvey stepped forward.</p>

<p>"That is my name; what do you wish with me?"</p>

<p>"I have orders to hand over this biplane to you."</p>

<p>"To me!" repeated Harvey, who felt as if wonders would never
cease; "why to me?"</p>

<p>"Your father, Mr. Gabriel Hamilton, ordered it by telegraph to
be sent here this morning. I understand your machine has been
wrecked."</p>

<p>"It has, but how did you learn it?"</p>

<p>The handsome youth smiled as he offered his hand.</p>

<p>"I am Paul Mitchell, from Garden City; we received a telegram
from your father this morning asking us to send a biplane to you
at once, as yours had been knocked out of commission. We happened
to have one ready and I started right off and have made pretty
good time to this spot in Pennsylvania."</p>

<p>"I should say you had, for it is several hundred miles from Long
Island; but how in the name of the seven wonders did father come
to know of my mishap?"</p>

<p>Young Mitchell laughed.</p>

<p>"He gave no explanation, but some one must have told him."</p>

<p>"Who could it have been?"</p>

<p>"I give it up."</p>

<p>"Were you asked to come to Groveton?"</p>

<p>"No; Chesterton was given as the place where your misfortune
overtook you. Since I did not know the particulars, our folks
thought it best I should meet you at some point not far from there.
In replying to your father’s telegram, I stated this, which explains
why he repeated the name to you."</p>

<p>"But not where he got his knowledge."</p>

<p>"Let that question go till you meet him, when he will make it
clear. What caused the breakage of your machine?"</p>

<p>"Somebody chopped it up; it was done in spite."</p>

<p>"Did you catch the scoundrel?"</p>

<p>"Catch him! no; nobody knows where he is."</p>

<p>"Well, such things happen and it is all a part of the game. Suppose
we go to Chesterton, and have a look at the remains; there must
be some salvage which I can ship to the factory. How about the
engine?"</p>

<p>"It is battered, but must be worth repairing."</p>

<p>"If you and your friend will seat yourselves, I shall have you
there in a jiffy."</p>

<p>Bohunkus and Harvey climbed into the seat and adjusted themselves.
Young Mitchell examined the different parts of the biplane, which
was an almost exact replica of the one that had been wrecked,
and then took charge of the business. At his request one of the
bystanders swung the blades of the propeller around so as to start
the motor, and several held on until the tugging almost drew them
off their feet. Then they let go, and away sailed the second machine
for Chesterton. </p>
