<p>A moment after the hail was heard from the roof, the muffled
noise which accompanied it ceased. The stranger groping about
in the snowy gloom had stepped off the roof into the huge drift
outside the Heavenly Bower, and a minute later, lifted the latch
of the door and pushed in among the astonished miners. They saw
the figure of a sturdy man holding something in his arms, so wrapped
round with blankets and coverings that no one could tell its nature.
He stamped the snow from his boots, shook himself like a shaggy
dog, then walked heavily to the chair which Budge Isham placed
near the fire for him, and almost fell into it.</p>

<p>"Good evening, friends," he said in a grave voice; "It was no
fault of mine that I tried at first to enter by the roof."</p>

<p>"When I built the Heavenly Bower," replied Landlord Ortigies;
"I meant to place a door up there, but there wasn't anybody in
New Constantinople with enough sense to know how to do it. I 'spose
you was looking fur it, stranger."</p>

<p>"No," was the reply, "I wasn't looking for anything; I was just
walking, walking through the storm, not knowing or caring where
I went. I can't say how far I came, but it must have been a number
of miles. I was still plodding on, when I set my foot on vacancy
and down I went."</p>

<p>"Gracious! you fell nearly a hundred feet," said Parson Brush;
"it was a wonderful providence that saved you from being dashed
to death."</p>

<p>"The snow on the roof must be five or six feet deep," replied
the stranger; "for it received me as if it were a feather bed.
I saw a glow from the top of your chimney against the rocks and
knew I was on the roof of a house. I hardly felt jarred and groped
my way off into a lot more snow and here I am."</p>

<p>The astonishment of the listeners did not make them forget the
laws of hospitality. Budge Isham looked significantly at the landlord,
but he had already drawn a glass of spirits and was coming from
behind the bar with it.</p>

<p>"Stranger, swallow this; you look cold; you're welcome to the
Heavenly Bower, whether you come through the roof or down the
chimbley."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I'll take the whiskey in a minute."</p>

<p>And then feeling that he owed those who made him so welcome some
explanation of his coming among them, the stranger said:</p>

<p>"My friends, my name is Maurice Dawson. About two months ago,
I left Independence, Missouri, with an emigrant train for the
Pacific coast. The elements, disease and the Indians made such
inroads upon us that after a time only half a dozen families remained.
As if that wasn't enough, the few survivors quarreled over the
course to follow, most of them aiming for a pass through the mountains
into Southern California, while I, the greatest fool of them all,
set out to find Dead Man's Gulch, of which I had heard from a
party of trappers. My canvas covered wagon, with a single span
of horses, contained all my worldly goods, and my companions were
my wife and little girl Nellie, only three years old. Everything
might have gone well but for this blizzard, which jumbled up the
points of the compass and made traveling so difficult that after
a time it became impossible."</p>

<p>All were listening with the closest interest, and every heart
was touched by the emotion of the man, which he could not control
for several minutes. No one interrupted, and, feeling that his
story was not quite completed, he added:</p>

<p>"I fired my gun in the hope of attracting attention, but fortunately
for others I was the only one abroad. By and by the horses stopped.
They could draw the wagon no further. They stood panting and exhausted
and soon lay down in the snow. I turned to speak to my wife, when
I found she had been dead for some minutes, the cold carrying
her off as quietly as if she were dropping asleep. Before she
passed away, she wrapped nearly all her clothing about Nellie,
who was cuddling beside her, so that really the mother, like the
noble woman she was, gave her life for the little one. It was
because Nellie was alive, that I jumped out of the wagon and began
floundering through the snow. I ploughed blindly forward until
providence guided me to you."</p>

<p>While uttering the last words, Maurice Dawson was tenderly unwrapping
the bundle in his arms. There were many folds to draw away, but
at last he reached the treasure within, which was his Nellie,
still sound asleep.</p>

<p>If the miners were startled by the resounding thump on the roof,
they were now almost struck dumb with amazement. They sat with
open mouths, staring eyes and for a minute no one spoke or stirred.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my Nellie," murmured the father, bending his
head and touching his lips to the cool forehead; "I had no hope
of this when I left your dead mother and started on my tramp through
the snow."</p>

<p>A general sigh went up from the group of awed miners. Wade Ruggles,
who had been leaning on the bar, with his gaze fixed on that of
the handsome stranger, was the first to recover from the spell
which held them all. Tiptoeing across the room, he paused in front
of the father and his child and stared, wondering and speechless.
Then one by one the others did the same, until the whole company
were grouped around the man and child, each afraid to whisper,
as if doing so would dissolve the heavenly vision.</p>

<p>When the wrappings had been laid aside, and the little one was
placed upright, she stared bewildered into the shaggy faces around
her. Her big blue eyes were open to their widest extent, the mass
of golden curls rippled about her shoulders and the fairy-like
feet were inclosed in thick, warm shoes and stockings. The dress
of a dull brown color and thick texture, fitted her tiny frame
perfectly and she formed a most winsome picture of infantile beauty.</p>

<p>For fully five minutes all stared in silence at the marvelous
picture. As before, Wade Ruggles was the first to come to himself,
but when he spoke, it was in an awed, hesitating whisper:</p>

<p>"Is she really alive?"</p>

<p>The sorrowful face of the father lit up with a faint smile as
he answered:</p>

<p>"Yes; thank heaven; alive and well."</p>

<p>"May I touch her?" timidly asked Ike Hoe, extending his finger
which faintly brushed the rosy cheek, and was instantly snatched
away as if he felt he had done a sacrilegious thing.</p>

<p>"I say," ventured Ruggles gathering courage, "I wonder now if
she would let me take her in my arms for a minute or so; I won't
drop her; but that's too much to ask, howsumever."</p>

<p>While he stood hopeful, hesitating and doubtful, Nellie with
a half frightened smile, dived her head under the arm of her father,
as if to get away from the embarrassing situation. He gently fondled
the golden hair and drew her face into view again.</p>

<p>"There, little one, there's nothing to be frightened at; these
people are all your friends and will do anything they can to please
you."</p>

<p>"You're right!" exclaimed Landlord Ortigies, with a shake of
his head; "we'll do anything in the world for you; if you say
the word, I'll stand on my head or stand any one else here the
same way."</p>

<p>And he showed an alarming inclination to invert himself for the
amusement of the child, but she did not seem to grasp the meaning
of the offer. She fixed her eyes upon Ruggles, who made bold by
what seemed a favorable sign, took a step forward and invitingly
extended his hands. She debated for a moment, whether to meet
the proffer and then with the impulsiveness of infancy leaned
toward him. With a thrill of pleasure the grizzled miner carefully
placed his huge arms underneath hers, and lifted her as if she
were a doll from her father's knee. As he did so, every one saw
the big tears trickling down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"I can't help it, boys," he said apologetically; "the last child
I held in these arms was my own Jennie, and she was dead."</p>

<p>With infinite affection, he pressed his bearded lips against
the chubby cheek, while she, relieved of all fear, flung her dimpled
arms about his neck and kissed him in return. With one hand, she
lifted the flapping hat from his head and with the other smoothed
away the luxuriant hair from his forehead.</p>

<p>"I like you ever so much, but you are crying," she said sympathetically;
"what makes you do that? Haven't you got a little girl like me?"</p>

<p>"No, my precious child; I once had just such a sweet tot as you,
but the good Lord took her from me, and I love you just as I loved
her."</p>

<p>"And that's what we all are going to do," remarked Ike Hoe, with
a sniff as he drew his sleeve across his eyes; "this beats anything
in the history of New Constantinople, by seven hundred and eighty-four
thousand majority."</p>

<p>"Come, Wade, you must be fair with us," said the landlord, reaching
out his arms; "we all claim an equal share in her."</p>

<p>The miner felt the truth of this, and without a word relinquished
the treasure. Drawing his handkerchief, he wiped his eyes clear
of their mist and jealously followed the surrendered one as she
was fondled in turn by the others. First one and then another,
until she had completed the round. All had something pleasant
to say to her and she replied in her sweet innocent way, causing
laughter and winning her path straight to the hearts of the hardy
fellows, to whom such endearments had been unknown for years,
but whose better natures were stirred by the presence of the child,
as if she were in reality an angel sent from heaven.</p>

<p>Felix Brush had purposely left his turn for the last, hoping
thereby to retain her longer than his friends. After chatting
with her for a moment and repeating some rigmarole that set her
laughing, followed by the request for him to say it again, he
stood her on the bar. Then he danced in front of her, swung his
arms like a jumping-jack, and told some outlandish fairy story
from the stock that no one had ever suspected he possessed.</p>

<p>"Can you stand on your head?" asked Nellie, rippling over with
fun.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied, as without a moment's hesitation, he
inverted himself and cracked his heels together, though the attitude
was such an unfamiliar one that he careened and went over on his
back with a thump that made the room tremble. Nellie clapped her
chubby hands with delight and before Brush could repeat the performance,
she called:</p>

<p>"Catch me; I'm going to jump."</p>

<p>"All right; I'm ready for you."</p>

<p>She recoiled a step to gather momentum and Landlord Ortigies,
terrified at the fear that she might step off backward, made a
dive round the end of the bar, catching his foot in an obstruction
and falling with a crash that drew all attention to him.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry; be you hurt?" asked Nellie, turning her head and
surveying him, as his face came up to view like the full moon
rising above the horizon.</p>

<p>"Not a bit; I done that on purpose to make you laugh; I always
do that to please good little girls like you."</p>

<p>"Bime by I'll let you fall all the time, but just see me jump."</p>

<p>Felix Brush was still standing, with arms outstretched, and,
without a second's hesitation the child leaped off into space.
She showed no fright, for there was no cause for it, since she
was caught fairly and securely. Inasmuch as she had been fondled
by every one, and the parson had had her longer than anyone else,
he set her down on the floor and she began running here and there,
displaying a childish curiosity to understand everything in sight.
Going to the half-opened door, communicating with the darkened
apartment at the rear, she peeped timidly in.</p>

<p>"Who lives in dere?" she asked, turning around and addressing
the whole group who were laughingly watching her.</p>

<p>"That's where I live," replied Ortigies.</p>

<p>"Do you live all alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my child."</p>

<p>"Haven't you got any little girl like me?"</p>

<p>"No; I'd give all I have in the world if I had."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to have me for your little girl?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I would; will you be my little girl?"</p>

<p>The baby face became thoughtful. She thrust one finger in the
corner of her mouth and looked down at the floor.</p>

<p>"What would papa do and those other folks? I will be the little
girl for all of you."</p>

<p>This struck the party as the brightest and wittiest expression
ever made by a mortal. They laughed, clapped their hands and striking
each other on the shoulder wanted to know whether anything of
the like had ever before been heard. Certainly not. Without paying
any heed to them, Nellie was peering into the room again.</p>

<p>"It's dark and cold," she said in an awed voice, turning her
face around, the better to communicate the information; "but I
ain't afraid."</p>

<p>Before she could fairly enter the place, her father, who was
affectionately watching her, said:</p>

<p>"I guess you would better not go in there, Nellie; it's growing
late and is time you prepared for bed."</p>

<p>"I'll fix a place for her," said Ortigies; "we ain't much on
style here, but I can manage to make her comfortable."</p>

<p>"But will it not discommode you?"</p>

<p>"That little gal can't discommode any one in New Constantinople;
if she would prefer to have me go out and sleep in the snow, I'll
be glad to do it."</p>

<p>"I've just the place for her," interposed Wade Ruggles; "couldn't
be better if I had taken a week to get it ready."</p>

<p>"Can't begin with my quarters," Felix Brush hastened to say,
and there would have been a general wrangle for the privilege
of accommodating the little one, had not her father, seeing how
matters were going, smilingly raised his hand in protest.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you, my friends, how much I thank you all for
your kindness. Ah, if my poor wife could have held out until she
reached here, but that was not to be. I shall be glad to stay
with Mr. Ortigies to-night, and with your permission shall remain
for a few days in your settlement. I have lost everything I owned
in the world, and will need some time to decide what is best to
do. Our stay in New Constantinople will give all a better chance
to get acquainted with Nellie. I'll surrender her to you until
you get tired of her."</p>

<p>"Get tired of her!" repeated Vose Adams, voicing the sentiments
of all; "we're not the kind of galoots to git tired of an angel."</p>

<p>The father expressed his thanks with such winsome grace, that
every man instinctively felt that he was a born gentleman. There
was not a miner in the room who did not sympathize with him in
his affliction, and yet they envied him the possession of the
child, whose innocence and beauty impressed them as more wonderful
than they had ever looked upon before. When Felix Brush whispered
to Budge Isham that arrangements must be made in some way to keep
the father with them, for the sake of having the child, his friend
nodded his head, and said he had made up his mind to the same
effect from the moment the parent referred to the matter. And
the sentiments of these two were those of the rest.</p>

<p>"Come, Nellie, let me prepare you for bed; it's a long time since
you have had that privilege."</p>

<p>The little one obediently walked to her father and turned her
back to him that he might better remove her clothing.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have plenty of covering for her?" remarked the
parent inquiringly to the landlord.</p>

<p>"There's all she can need."</p>

<p>Lifting her on his knee, the father began removing the shoes
and stockings, the little one giving what aid she could, when
it came to the garments. One of the last acts of the affectionate
mother had been to place upon her child the gown she was accustomed
to wear while asleep. When at last she was ready, she looked up
to her father and asked in a half whisper:</p>

<p>"Where's mamma?"</p>

<p>"She will not be with us to-night."</p>

<p>"Then she will come in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Wait until then, my child; don't say anything more about mamma
now."</p>

<p>She was satisfied, and signified that she was ready to have her
father carry her to her bed. Then she exclaimed with a laugh:</p>

<p>"Ain't that funny?"</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I like to fordot to say my prayers."</p>

<p>And slipping from her father's knee, she knelt on the floor,
with her hands covering her face which, as it pressed his knee,
was hidden by the mass of golden ringlets clustering and falling
about it. Not a man stirred or spoke. All were so silent that
the sifting of the snow against the logs, the moaning of the gale
and the soft rustle of the embers that broke apart on the hearth
were audible. But all these were as the "voice of silence" itself,
so that when the child began her prayer in a low voice, every
syllable was heard.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Now I lay me down to sleep.<br/>
I pray the Lord my soul to keep;<br/>
If I should die before I wake,<br/>
I pray the Lord my soul to take.<br/>
God bless papa, mamma and make Nellie a good girl; bless&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>Wheeling short round at the silent, awed group, she looked at
the landlord and asked:</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Or-ti-gies," he replied, pronouncing it carefully.</p>

<p>She made rather sorry work at first, but there could be no doubt
that the One to whom she was addressing the petition understood
her wishes. When she had satisfied herself and included the landlord
in her prayer, she ceased again, and this time looked up at her
father whose hand was resting on her head.</p>

<p>"I must pray for <em>all</em> of them, musn't I?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my child."</p>

<p>"But I don't know dere names."</p>

<p>"They will all tell them."</p>

<p>No act of worship in church or grand cathedral was more solemn
and reverential than that of the men, as each in turn stepped
softly forward with bowed head, and repeated his name to the tiny
petitioner, who immediately included it with those for whom she
had already prayed and it was wafted upward through space to Him
who delights to hear and answer such petitions.</p>

<p>She did not forget one. To make sure, she looked up while still
on her knees and asked:</p>

<p>"Did I fordot any of you?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the parent; "you have not missed any. That's a
good girl."</p>

<p>"And I know they will all be good, for I asked God to make 'em
so."</p>

<p>The father now rose to his feet with her in his arms, and she
called a general good night, flinging a kiss to all. Landlord
Ortigies had lit an extra lamp and with it in hand, he led the
way to the rear room, where as he stated, comfortable quarters
were provided for the little one. Since the Heavenly Bower was
the only place in the mining settlement where the wanderer, who
occasionally made his way into that remote part of the world,
could expect to find sleeping accommodations, Ortigies was always
prepared for visitors. Thus he was able to furnish the father
with a couch so placed that he virtually shared the bed with his
child.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, when he stole back into the room with the
landlord to see whether everything was right with his child, she
was found sunk in the sweet, dreamless slumber of infancy. The
picture was so winsome as she lay with her cheek resting upon
the rough pillow, that Ortigies stepped softly to the door and
beckoned to his friends. Everyone stole forward, and stood looking
down for several minutes upon the sleeper, and, as he did so,
new resolves sprang into his heart. Already it may be said they
were better men because of the blessed messenger that had come
among them.</p>
