<p>Turkey Proudfoot came hurrying back to the farmyard from the meadow
where Mr. Crow had stopped and advised him to go home and see Johnnie
Green's new pet.
</p>
<p>When Turkey Proudfoot scurried around the barn he found everybody all
a-flutter. No one paid any attention to Turkey Proudfoot, though he
spread his tail and strutted up to his neighbors with a most important
air.
</p><p>"What's going on here?" Turkey Proudfoot demanded in his most lordly
tone.
</p><p>Henrietta Hen went out of her way to answer him. "Johnnie Green has a
new pet," she explained. "He's a wonderful creature."
</p><p>"I don't think much of him," said the rooster. He had a surly look, as
if something--perhaps a pebble--had stuck in his crop.
</p><p>"I can't quite swallow this new pet," the rooster told Turkey Proudfoot.
</p><p>"Ah! You haven't seen him with his tail spread!" Henrietta Hen
exclaimed. "His tail is simply gorgeous."
</p><p>His tail! That was exactly what old Mr. Crow had mentioned. "Oh, well!"
Turkey Proudfoot thought. "I'm foolish to be stirred up over this
affair. The new pet's tail can't be as grand as mine. There's nothing
for me to worry about."
</p><p>But there was. What Henrietta Hen said with her next breath made Turkey
Proudfoot miserable.
</p><p>"You'd better put down your tail," she advised him.
</p><p>"Put down my tail!" he squawked. "Anybody would think you were talking
about an umbrella. What's wrong with my tail, madam? I hope you don't
think I'm ashamed of it."
</p><p>"I fear you will be, when you see Johnnie Green's new pet," Henrietta
Hen rattled on. "You'll want to hide your tail then."
</p><p>"Stop!" cried Turkey Proudfoot sternly. "You have said too much."
</p><p>"Good!" the rooster chimed in. "I agree with you. She always talks too
much." Once such a remark about Henrietta Hen would have made the
rooster angry. Now, however, it pleased him.
</p><p>"I know what's the matter with you," Henrietta Hen told the rooster.
"Your nose is out of joint."
</p><p>"I beg your pardon," said the rooster. "My nose--and by that no doubt
you mean my bill--is <u>not</u> out of joint."
</p><p>"Oh, yes it is!" she insisted. "And Turkey Proudfoot's will be out of
joint too, as soon as he sees the newcomer."
</p><p>"Where is he?" Turkey Proudfoot suddenly demanded. "Let me have a look
at him! I'll soon show <u>him</u> whether there's anything wrong with my
bill." He puffed himself up and looked very fierce.
</p><p>To his amazement, Henrietta Hen only laughed.
</p><p>"Tell that to the new pet!" she said. "You'll find him in front of the
farmhouse."
</p><p>Turkey Proudfoot didn't thank her. He was so angry that he was almost
choking. And he strode off with a gleam in his eyes that the younger
gobblers knew only too well--and feared.

</p><p>On the lawn before Farmer Green's house Turkey Proudfoot saw such a
sight as he had never expected to behold. A big bird stood proudly on
the grass plot, looking for all the world as if he owned not only the
house, but the whole farm. His colors were like the blues and greens of
a rainbow. And behind him he carried aloft a tail that made Turkey
Proudfoot all but ill with envy.
</p><p>"Who-who-who is this person?" Turkey Proudfoot gasped, turning to old
dog Spot.
</p><p>"Don't you know?" said Spot. "He's Johnnie Green's new pet. He's the
Peacock."
