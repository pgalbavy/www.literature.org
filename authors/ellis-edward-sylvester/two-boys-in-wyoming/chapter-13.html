<p>Once more Motoza had allowed an American youth to get the drop
on him, for he could not mistake the meaning of that command,
nor the deeper eloquence of the pose of Fred Greenwood with his
rifle at a dead level. The Sioux must have despised himself for
his forgetfulness.</p>

<p>But he had already proven the readiness with which he accepted
a situation, no matter how unwelcome. The hand that held the weapon
of Jack Dudley whipped round to the front with a deft movement,
which, however, was not quicker than the return of the grin to
his countenance.</p>

<p>"Motoza friend&mdash;he not want gun of brother," he remarked.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't get it if you <em>did</em> want it," said Jack,
not to be mollified by this sudden change of front. Instead of
accepting the hypocritical proffer, the youth was imprudent enough
to add, as he felt his Winchester once more in his grasp:</p>

<p>"You are the meanest thief in the country, Motoza, and this must
be the last time you try your hand on us."</p>

<p>"Off with you!" added Fred, beginning to tire with the constraint
of his position; "good-by, Motoza, and I hope we shall not meet
again."</p>

<p>At the moment of obeying, the Sioux glanced at the lad who had
thus turned the tables on him. The expression of his face was
frightful. Ferocious hate, thirst for revenge and flaming anger
shone through the coat of paint and were concentrated on the younger
of the youths. Fred saw it and cared not, but Jack was so alarmed
that he almost wished his comrade would fire his weapon and thus
shut out the fruition of the horrible threat that gleamed through
that look.</p>

<p>It lasted, however, but an instant. Much in the same manner as
in the grove, when caught at a disadvantage by Jack Dudley, the
Sioux walked off and was quickly lost to view.</p>

<p>Neither of the boys spoke for several minutes. Then Jack asked,
in an awed voice:</p>

<p>"Did you see his face when he turned toward you just before walking
away?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I have seen handsomer ones."</p>

<p>"You may make light of it, Fred, but I was much nearer than you,
and that expression will haunt me for many a day and night to
come."</p>

<p>To the astonishment of the elder, Fred began laughing, as if
he found it all very amusing. Jack, in surprise, asked the cause
of his mirth.</p>

<p>"If Motoza had only known the truth! There isn't a cartridge
either in the magazine or the chamber of my rifle, which reminds
me."</p>

<p>And still laughing, the younger proceeded to fill the magazine
from his belt and to put his Winchester in condition for immediate
use.</p>

<p>"We have been told many times, Jack, that the first thing to
do after firing a gun is to reload, and I see how much more important
it is here than at home."</p>

<p>When Jack came to examine his weapon he found a half-dozen cartridges
remaining in the magazine, and he, too, placed the weapon in the
best form for use. They changed their position, returning to the
spot where the crisis had taken place with the grizzly, for both
felt some misgiving concerning the Sioux, who could not be far
off.</p>

<p>"Jack, what about the feelings of Motoza <em>now</em>?"</p>

<p>"It begins to look as if Hank was right. I am sure the Indian
doesn't hold much friendship for either of us. He is bad clean
through."</p>

<p>"He may have some regard for <em>you</em>, but there wasn't much
tender affection in the last lingering look he gave <em>me</em>."</p>

<p>Jack shuddered.</p>

<p>"I never saw anything like it. If he had had the power he would
have killed you with that look. I feel like urging Hank, when
we next see him, to make a change of quarters."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"That we may find some section where we are not likely to meet
Motoza again. I don't understand why so many Indians are off the
reservation. There must be a number of them that are friends of
Motoza, and they will try some other trick on us."</p>

<p>"He has tried one or two already," replied Fred, much less impressed
with the danger than his friend.</p>

<p>"True, we have had remarkably good fortune, but it can't last.
Motoza will learn to be more cunning next time."</p>

<p>"If you feel that way, Jack, the best thing for us to do is to
go home."</p>

<p>"Your words are hardly worthy of you, Fred," replied Jack, hurt
at the slur.</p>

<p>"I ask your pardon. I know it is your friendship for me that
speaks, but I cannot feel the fear that disturbs you. Suppose
we drop the question till we see Hank. We will let him know everything
that has taken place and rely upon him."</p>

<p>This was a wise conclusion, but the fact remained that there
was no expectation of seeing their guide until night, which was
a number of hours distant, and, since the Indians were in the
vicinity, there was plenty of time for a great many things to
happen. It would seem, indeed, that the advantage was almost entirely
on the side of Motoza, for, with his superior woodcraft, he could
keep track of the movements of the boys without their discovering
or suspecting his presence. Altogether, it looked as if a meeting
with their guide could not take place too soon.</p>

<p>From a point perhaps a mile away came the faint report of a rifle,
followed in the same second by another report. The fact suggested
more than one startling supposition, but the youths were in no
mood to speculate thereon, for it will be admitted that the incidents
of the forenoon were sufficient to engage their thoughts.</p>

<p>It was a hard fact, however, that when they looked at their watches
and found that it was noon, the most interesting subject that
presented itself was as to how they could secure the meal which
they felt was overdue.</p>

<p>"Let's make a hunt in a different direction," said Fred. "It
is best to keep away from the neighborhood of those Indians, so
far as we can locate them from the shots we occasionally hear,
for the game isn't likely to stay where they are."</p>

<p>"Off yonder to the north appears to be a valley," remarked Jack,
after the two had studied their surroundings for some minutes
through their glasses. "I can't tell how extensive it is, for
it is shut out by that mountain peak on the right, but I suppose
one place is as good as another."</p>

<p>Having agreed as to their course, they wasted no time. It was
a long and severe tramp to the locality, for again the peculiar
purity of the atmosphere misled them, and what they took to be
one mile proved to be fully double that length. Finally the hungry
lads reached a ridge from whose top they could look down in the
valley that had first caught their attention, but which for the
last hour had been excluded from their sight by the intervening
obstacles.</p>

<p>"Now, we can't tell whether any game is below waiting for us,"
said Jack, "but we can't lose anything by acting as if there is."</p>

<p>It was a wise precaution, as speedily became apparent. As carefully
as a couple of Indians they picked their way up the slope, and
just before reaching the crest sank upon their knees, and, crawling
a little further, peeped over the top as if they expected to discover
a hostile camp within a hundred yards.</p>

<p>The prospect caused an involuntary exclamation of pleasure from
both. The valley was two or three hundred yards in width, and,
after winding past, curved out of sight behind the mountain range
already referred to. It was one emerald mass of rich grass, in
which ten thousand cattle could have found abundant pasturage.
No trees appeared anywhere except at the furthest bend in the
valley, where a small grove stood near the middle, and seemed
to surround a spring of water, which, flowing in the other direction,
was not within sight of the young hunters.</p>

<p>What lent additional beauty to this landscape was the singular
uniformity of the valley. The slope was gentle on each side, without
any abrupt declivities, and there was hardly any variation in
its width. The dark-green color of the incline and bottom of the
valley gave the whole scene a softness that would have charmed
an artist.</p>

<p>The young men admired the picturesque prospect, the like of which
they had never before viewed, and yet it must be confessed that
one feature of the landscape appealed more strongly to them than
all the rest. Perhaps a half-mile away six or eight antelope were
cropping the grass, unconscious of the approach of danger. They
were near the small clump of trees alluded to, and may have lately
drank from the water flowing therefrom. They were in a bunch,
all their heads down, and had evidently taken no alarm from the
occasional distant reports of guns.</p>

<p>"I say, Jack, there's a splendid dinner!" whispered Fred, excitedly.</p>

<p>"What good will it do us, so long as it is <em>there</em>? I
should like to have it <em>here</em>."</p>

<p>"It ought to be easy to pick off one of those creatures; Hank
told us they make fine eating."</p>

<p>"That is all true, but it is also true that the antelope is one
of the most timid of creatures, and the best hunter finds it hard
work to get within reach of them."</p>

<p>"You know how curious they are? The men at the ranch told the
other night about lying down in the grass in the middle of a prairie
and holding up a stick with a handkerchief at the end of it. Timid
as was the antelope, it would gradually draw near to find out
what the thing meant, and pay for its curiosity with its life."</p>

<p>Such incidents are quite common in the West, but neither of the
boys felt it safe to rely upon the stratagem. They feared that
at the first attempt the antelope would take fright and make off
beyond recovery, and Fred Greenwood's proposition was adopted.</p>

<p>"There doesn't seem to be any wind blowing, but if we try to
steal down the side of the valley we are sure to frighten them
off. Now, if you will stay here, Jack, I'll pick my way round
to the other side, so that the herd will be between us. Then I'll
do my best to get near enough for a shot; if I fail, they will
run for this point and come within range of you. Between us two,
one is certain to get a shot at them."</p>

<p>"It's putting a big lot of work on you, Fred," said the chivalrous
Jack.</p>

<p>"It won't be half as hard to bear as the hunger I'll feel in
the course of an hour or two if we don't get one of them."</p>

<p>The plan was so simple that no explanation was necessary. Jack
Dudley had only to remain extended on the ground where he was,
with his Winchester ready, and keep an eye on the little herd,
which could not observe him unless he was unusually careless.
He could easily judge of Fred's success or failure by watching
the animals, and it would seem that success was almost certain
for one of the young hunters. The only thing to be feared was
that Fred would betray himself before reaching the other side
of the game that was so tempting to both.</p>

<p>The comrades looked at their watches at the moment of separating,
and found it was precisely one o'clock. Fred gave himself an hour
to reach a point from which to start on his return, though it
was possible that double that time would be required. Before the
interval had expired Jack had his glass to his eyes, and was studying
the valley below.</p>

<p>As the antelope cropped the rich grass they occasionally took
a step in the direction of the watcher; but the largest one, evidently
the leader, changed his course so as to work back toward the little
grove of trees, the others following. Now and then the leader
raised his head and looked around, as if suspecting danger, though
his fears were not confirmed. At longer intervals other members
of the herd did the same, but it was evident that they neither
saw nor scented anything amiss.</p>

<p>Jack's constant fear was that Fred would betray himself through
some accident. His course would bring him nearer the game and
the risk was considerable; but as the minutes passed without anything
of that nature taking place, his hope increased.</p>

<p>"More than likely Fred himself will get the shot instead of me.
It makes no difference, so that we don't lose our supper; for,"
he added, dismally, "the dinner is already gone."</p>

<p>When another half-hour had passed, he was sure his chum was on
the other side of the herd.</p>

<p>"There must be a break pretty soon. Suppose that instead of coming
toward me," added Jack, giving expression to a dread that had
not occurred to him until then, "they dash off into the mountains
on either side. Then we shall be doomed to starvation!"</p>

<p>He thought that with the aid of his glass he would be able to
follow Fred as he stole down the side of the valley, since the
position of the spectator was much more elevated than that of
the antelope. It would require sharp scrutiny even with the aid
of the instrument to do this, and, look as keenly as he might,
he could discover nothing that suggested anything of that nature.</p>

<p>When three o'clock went by without any evidence of alarm among
the animals browsing in the middle of the valley, Jack Dudley
began to wonder what it could mean.</p>

<p>"Fred was sure that a single hour was enough to place himself
on the further side of them, and double that time has passed.
He ought to be well down the slope, but I can see nothing of him."</p>

<p>One fact, however, was apparent: the antelope were steadily though
slowly working toward the ridge on which the young man lay. At
the rate they were advancing it would not be long before it would
be safe to try a shot.</p>

<p>This progress could not be laid to any alarm coming from the
other side. If the animals received fright they would be off with
the speed of the wind, instead of inching along in the fashion
they were now following.</p>

<p>"It begins to look as if I am to secure the meal, after all,"
thought Jack, forgetting his slight uneasiness for his friend
in his growing excitement.</p>

<p>The following minute gave proof of the timidity of the American
antelope. With all the care possible, the youth extended his gun
in front of him over the slope, but the herd took the alarm on
the instant, though it seemed impossible that they should have
seen or heard anything. The leader raised his head, and whirling
to one side, started at a swift gallop toward the other end of
the valley, the rest of the animals being hardly a second behind
him.</p>

<p>The peculiar panic and stampede of the creatures gave Jack Dudley
the best possible target, though the shot was a long one. He did
not aim at the leader, but at a smaller animal that immediately
followed him. The bullet pierced the heart of the antelope, which
made a frenzied leap high in air, staggered a few paces, and dropped
to the ground without a particle of life.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" exclaimed the delighted Jack, springing up and dashing
down the side of the valley toward his prize; "I beat you, after
all, Fred!"</p>

<p>Not doubting that his comrade would speedily appear, Jack gave
no further thought to him, but continued running until he reached
the prize. He had learned the art so rapidly that it took but
a few minutes to cut all he could need for himself and friend.
Then he hurried to the little grove near by, washed and dressed
the food, which seemed to be juicy and tender, and started a fire
for the purpose of broiling it.</p>

<p>He had not paused in his work up to this point, but now he stopped
with the first real thrill of alarm for his friend.</p>

<p>"Four o'clock!" he exclaimed to himself; "what can have become
of him?"</p>

<p>He walked to the edge of the trees and looked out, anxiously
peering in different directions, but nothing was seen of his friend.
Knowing Fred's waggish nature, Jack hoped that he was indulging
in some jest, but he could not quite convince himself that such
was the fact. The hunger of Fred would have prevented his postponing
the meal one moment longer than was necessary.</p>

<p>When an abundance of food was browned and crisped and ready the
appetite of Jack Dudley was less than it was two hours before,
the cause being his growing alarm over the unaccountable absence
of Fred.</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," he repeated for the twentieth time;
"some accident must have befallen him. Can it be Motoza has had
anything to do with it?"</p>

<p>It was the first time that Jack had expressed this fear in words,
but it was by no means the first time he had felt it. Rather curiously,
from the moment his friend passed out of sight, several hours
before, the vague misgiving began to shape itself in his mind.
He fought it off and succeeded in repressing it for a time, but
he could do so no longer.</p>

<p>"Fred didn't seem to give any meaning to that awful look of the
Sioux when he started to walk away, but I saw what it meant, though
I never dreamed the blow would fall so soon."</p>

<p>His heart was depressed almost beyond bearing, and the anguish
was deepened by the fact that he could see no way of helping his
friend. The only thing possible was to follow as nearly as he
could the course taken by Fred, but there was no certainty of
that. He knew he had turned to the right when he left the crest
of the ridge, after which there had been no glimpse of him.</p>

<p>"But he made for a point over yonder," reflected Jack, "and there
I'll search for him."</p>

<p>This was exceedingly indefinite, but it was better than standing
idle. The antelope had long since vanished, and there was no need
of care in his progress&mdash;rather otherwise, since he desired to
attract the notice of his friend. Jack broke into a loping trot,
emitting the familiar signal so often used by both, calling his
name, and even firing his rifle in air; but there came back no
response, and his fears deepened.</p>

<p>Jack was in the mood to be unjust.</p>

<p>"I don't understand Hank Hazletine's action. He sets out to take
us on a hunt among the mountains, and then goes off and leaves
us alone. Why doesn't he stay with us? If he had done that, this
never could have happened. Fred and I can generally take care
of ourselves, but we are not used to this plagued country, which
I wish neither he nor I had ever set foot in."</p>
