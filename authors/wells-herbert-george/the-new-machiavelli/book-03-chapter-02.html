I have told of my gradual abandonment of the pretensions and habits 
of party Liberalism.  In a sense I was moving towards aristocracy.  
Regarding the development of the social and individual mental 
hinterland as the essential thing in human progress, I passed on 
very naturally to the practical assumption that we wanted what I may 
call "hinterlanders."  Of course I do not mean by aristocracy the 
changing unorganised medley of rich people and privileged people who 
dominate the civilised world of to-day, but as opposed to this, a 
possibility of co-ordinating the will of the finer individuals, by 
habit and literature, into a broad common aim.  We must have an 
aristocracy--not of privilege, but of understanding and purpose--or 
mankind will fail.  I find this dawning more and more clearly when I 
look through my various writings of the years between 1903 and 1910.  
I was already emerging to plain statements in 1908.
<P>
I reasoned after this fashion.  The line of human improvement and 
the expansion of human life lies in the direction of education and 
finer initiatives.  If humanity cannot develop an education far 
beyond anything that is now provided, if it cannot collectively 
invent devices and solve problems on a much richer, broader scale 
than it does at the present time, it cannot hope to achieve any very 
much finer order or any more general happiness than it now enjoys.  
We must believe, therefore, that it CAN develop such a training and 
education, or we must abandon secular constructive hope.  And here 
my peculiar difficulty as against crude democracy comes in.  If 
humanity at large is capable of that high education and those 
creative freedoms our hope demands, much more must its better and 
more vigorous types be so capable.  And if those who have power and 
leisure now, and freedom to respond to imaginative appeals, cannot 
be won to the idea of collective self-development, then the whole of 
humanity cannot be won to that.  From that one passes to what has 
become my general conception in politics, the conception of the 
constructive imagination working upon the vast complex of powerful 
people, clever people, enterprising people, influential people, 
amidst whom power is diffused to-day, to produce that self-
conscious, highly selective, open-minded, devoted aristocratic 
culture, which seems to me to be the necessary next phase in the 
development of human affairs.  I see human progress, not as the 
spontaneous product of crowds of raw minds swayed by elementary 
needs, but as a natural but elaborate result of intricate human 
interdependencies, of human energy and curiosity liberated and 
acting at leisure, of human passions and motives, modified and 
redirected by literature and art. . . .
<P>
But now the reader will understand how it came about that, 
disappointed by the essential littleness of Liberalism, and 
disillusioned about the representative quality of the professed 
Socialists, I turned my mind more and more to a scrutiny of the big 
people, the wealthy and influential people, against whom Liberalism 
pits its forces.  I was asking myself definitely whether, after all, 
it was not my particular job to work through them and not against 
them.  Was I not altogether out of my element as an Anti-?  Weren't 
there big bold qualities about these people that common men lack, 
and the possibility of far more splendid dreams?  Were they really 
the obstacles, might they not be rather the vehicles of the possible 
new braveries of life?

The faults of the Imperialist movement were obvious enough.  The 
conception of the Boer War had been clumsy and puerile, the costly 
errors of that struggle appalling, and the subsequent campaign of 
Mr. Chamberlain for Tariff Reform seemed calculated to combine the 
financial adventurers of the Empire in one vast conspiracy against 
the consumer.  The cant of Imperialism was easy to learn and use; it 
was speedily adopted by all sorts of base enterprises and turned to 
all sorts of base ends.  But a big child is permitted big mischief, 
and my mind was now continually returning to the persuasion that 
after all in some development of the idea of Imperial patriotism 
might be found that wide, rough, politically acceptable expression 
of a constructive dream capable of sustaining a great educational 
and philosophical movement such as no formula of Liberalism 
supplied.  The fact that it readily took vulgar forms only witnessed 
to its strong popular appeal.  Mixed in with the noisiness and 
humbug of the movement there appeared a real regard for social 
efficiency, a real spirit of animation and enterprise.  There 
suddenly appeared in my world--I saw them first, I think, in 1908--a 
new sort of little boy, a most agreeable development of the 
slouching, cunning, cigarette-smoking, town-bred youngster, a small 
boy in a khaki hat, and with bare knees and athletic bearing, 
earnestly engaged in wholesome and invigorating games up to and 
occasionally a little beyond his strength--the Boy Scout.  I liked 
the Boy Scout, and I find it difficult to express how much it 
mattered to me, with my growing bias in favour of deliberate 
national training, that Liberalism hadn't been able to produce, and 
had indeed never attempted to produce, anything of this kind.

In those days there existed a dining club called--there was some 
lost allusion to the exorcism of party feeling in its title--the 
Pentagram Circle.  It included Bailey and Dayton and myself, Sir 
Herbert Thorns, Lord Charles Kindling, Minns the poet, Gerbault the 
big railway man, Lord Gane, fresh from the settlement of Framboya, 
and Rumbold, who later became Home Secretary and left us.  We were 
men of all parties and very various experiences, and our object was 
to discuss the welfare of the Empire in a disinterested spirit.  We 
dined monthly at the Mermaid in Westminster, and for a couple of 
years we kept up an average attendance of ten out of fourteen.  The 
dinner-time was given up to desultory conversation, and it is odd 
how warm and good the social atmosphere of that little gathering 
became as time went on; then over the dessert, so soon as the 
waiters had swept away the crumbs and ceased to fret us, one of us 
would open with perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes' exposition of 
some specially prepared question, and after him we would deliver 
ourselves in turn, each for three or four minutes.  When every one 
present had spoken once talk became general again, and it was rare 
we emerged upon Hendon Street before midnight.  Sometimes, as my 
house was conveniently near, a knot of men would come home with me 
and go on talking and smoking in my dining-room until two or three.  
We had Fred Neal, that wild Irish journalist, among us towards the 
end, and his stupendous flow of words materially prolonged our 
closing discussions and made our continuance impossible.
<P>
I learned very much and very many things at those dinners, but more 
particularly did I become familiarised with the habits of mind of 
such men as Neal, Crupp, Gane, and the one or two other New 
Imperialists who belonged to us.  They were nearly all like Bailey 
Oxford men, though mostly of a younger generation, and they were all 
mysteriously and inexplicably advocates of Tariff Reform, as if it 
were the principal instead of at best a secondary aspect of 
constructive policy.  They seemed obsessed by the idea that streams 
of trade could be diverted violently so as to link the parts of the 
Empire by common interests, and they were persuaded, I still think 
mistakenly, that Tariff Reform would have an immense popular appeal.  
They were also very keen on military organisation, and with a 
curious little martinet twist in their minds that boded ill for that 
side of public liberty.  So much against them.  But they were 
disposed to spend money much more generously on education and 
research of all sorts than our formless host of Liberals seemed 
likely to do; and they were altogether more accessible than the 
Young Liberals to bold, constructive ideas affecting the 
universities and upper classes.  The Liberals are abjectly afraid of 
the universities.  I found myself constantly falling into line with 
these men in our discussions, and more and more hostile to Dayton's 
sentimentalising evasions of definite schemes and Minns' trust in 
such things as the "Spirit of our People" and the "General Trend of 
Progress."  It wasn't that I thought them very much righter than 
their opponents; I believe all definite party "sides" at any time 
are bound to be about equally right and equally lop-sided; but that 
I thought I could get more out of them and what was more important 
to me, more out of myself if I co-operated with them.  By 1908 I had 
already arrived at a point where I could be definitely considering a 
transfer of my political allegiance.
<P>
These abstract questions are inseparably interwoven with my memory 
of a shining long white table, and our hock bottles and burgundy 
bottles, and bottles of Perrier and St. Galmier and the disturbed 
central trophy of dessert, and scattered glasses and nut-shells and 
cigarette-ends and menu-cards used for memoranda.  I see old Dayton 
sitting back and cocking his eye to the ceiling in a way he had 
while he threw warmth into the ancient platitudes of Liberalism, and 
Minns leaning forward, and a little like a cockatoo with a taste for 
confidences, telling us in a hushed voice of his faith in the 
Destiny of Mankind.  Thorns lounges, rolling his round face and 
round eyes from speaker to speaker and sounding the visible depths 
of misery whenever Neal begins.  Gerbault and Gane were given to 
conversation in undertones, and Bailey pursued mysterious purposes 
in lisping whispers.  It was Crupp attracted me most.  He had, as 
people say, his eye on me from the beginning.  He used to speak at 
me, and drifted into a custom of coming home with me very regularly 
for an after-talk.
<P>
He opened his heart to me.
<P>
"Neither of us," he said, "are dukes, and neither of us are horny-
handed sons of toil.  We want to get hold of the handles, and to do 
that, one must go where the power is, and give it just as 
constructive a twist as we can.  That's MY Toryism."
<P>
"Is it Kindling's--or Gerbault's?"
<P>
"No.  But theirs is soft, and mine's hard.  Mine will wear theirs 
out.  You and I and Bailey are all after the same thing, and why 
aren't we working together?"
<P>
"Are you a Confederate?" I asked suddenly.
<P>
"That's a secret nobody tells," he said.
<P>
"What are the Confederates after?"
<P>
"Making aristocracy work, I suppose.  Just as, I gather, you want to 
do." . . .
<P>
The Confederates were being heard of at that time.  They were at 
once attractive and repellent to me, an odd secret society whose 
membership nobody knew, pledged, it was said, to impose Tariff 
Reform and an ample constructive policy upon the Conservatives.  In 
the press, at any rate, they had an air of deliberately organised 
power.  I have no doubt the rumour of them greatly influenced my 
ideas. . . .
<P>
In the end I made some very rapid decisions, but for nearly two 
years I was hesitating.  Hesitations were inevitable in such a 
matter.  I was not dealing with any simple question of principle, 
but with elusive and fluctuating estimates of the trend of diverse 
forces and of the nature of my own powers.  All through that period 
I was asking over and over again: how far are these Confederates 
mere dreamers?  How far--and this was more vital--are they rendering 
lip-service to social organisations?  Is it true they desire war 
because it confirms the ascendency of their class?  How far can 
Conservatism be induced to plan and construct before it resists the 
thrust towards change.  Is it really in bulk anything more than a 
mass of prejudice and conceit, cynical indulgence, and a hard 
suspicion of and hostility to the expropriated classes in the 
community?
<P>
That is a research which yields no statistics, an enquiry like 
asking what is the ruling colour of a chameleon.  The shadowy answer 
varied with my health, varied with my mood and the conduct of the 
people I was watching.  How fine can people be?  How generous?--not 
incidentally, but all round?  How far can you educate sons beyond 
the outlook of their fathers, and how far lift a rich, proud, self-
indulgent class above the protests of its business agents and 
solicitors and its own habits and vanity?  Is chivalry in a class 
possible?--was it ever, indeed, or will it ever indeed be possible?  
Is the progress that seems attainable in certain directions worth 
the retrogression that may be its price?
<P>

<P>
It was to the Pentagram Circle that I first broached the new 
conceptions that were developing in my mind.  I count the evening of 
my paper the beginning of the movement that created the BLUE WEEKLY 
and our wing of the present New Tory party.  I do that without any 
excessive egotism, because my essay was no solitary man's 
production; it was my reaction to forces that had come to me very 
large through my fellow-members; its quick reception by them showed 
that I was, so to speak, merely the first of the chestnuts to pop.  
The atmospheric quality of the evening stands out very vividly in my 
memory.  The night, I remember, was warmly foggy when after midnight 
we went to finish our talk at my house.
<P>
We had recently changed the rules of the club to admit visitors, and 
so it happened that I had brought Britten, and Crupp introduced 
Arnold Shoesmith, my former schoolfellow at City Merchants, and now 
the wealthy successor of his father and elder brother.  I remember 
his heavy, inexpressively handsome face lighting to his rare smile 
at the sight of me, and how little I dreamt of the tragic 
entanglement that was destined to involve us both.  Gane was 
present, and Esmeer, a newly-added member, but I think Bailey was 
absent.  Either he was absent, or he said something so entirely 
characteristic and undistinguished that it has left no impression on 
my mind.
<P>
I had broken a little from the traditions of the club even in my 
title, which was deliberately a challenge to the liberal idea: it 
was, "The World Exists for Exceptional People."  It is not the title 
I should choose now--for since that time I have got my phrase of 
"mental hinterlander" into journalistic use.  I should say now, "The 
World Exists for Mental Hinterland."
<P>
The notes I made of that opening have long since vanished with a 
thousand other papers, but some odd chance has preserved and brought 
with me to Italy the menu for the evening; its back black with the 
scrawled notes I made of the discussion for my reply.  I found it 
the other day among some letters from Margaret and a copy of the 
1909 Report of the Poor Law Commission, also rich with pencilled 
marginalia.
<P>
My opening was a criticism of the democratic idea and method, upon 
lines such as I have already sufficiently indicated in the preceding 
sections.  I remember how old Dayton fretted in his chair, and 
tushed and pished at that, even as I gave it, and afterwards we were 
treated to one of his platitudinous harangues, he sitting back in 
his chair with that small obstinate eye of his fixed on the ceiling, 
and a sort of cadaverous glow upon his face, repeating--quite 
regardless of all my reasoning and all that had been said by others 
in the debate--the sacred empty phrases that were his soul's refuge 
from reality.  "You may think it very clever," he said with a nod of 
his head to mark his sense of his point, "not to Trust in the 
People.  I do."  And so on.  Nothing in his life or work had ever 
shown that he did trust in the people, but that was beside the mark.  
He was the party Liberal, and these were the party incantations.
<P>
After my preliminary attack on vague democracy I went on to show 
that all human life was virtually aristocratic; people must either 
recognise aristocracy in general or else follow leaders, which is 
aristocracy in particular, and so I came to my point that the 
reality of human progress lay necessarily through the establishment 
of freedoms for the human best and a collective receptivity and 
understanding.  There was a disgusted grunt from Dayton, "Superman 
rubbish--Nietzsche.  Shaw!  Ugh!"  I sailed on over him to my next 
propositions.  The prime essential in a progressive civilisation was 
the establishment of a more effective selective process for the 
privilege of higher education, and the very highest educational 
opportunity for the educable.  We were too apt to patronise 
scholarship winners, as though a scholarship was toffee given as a 
reward for virtue.  It wasn't any reward at all; it was an 
invitation to capacity.  We had no more right to drag in virtue, or 
any merit but quality, than we had to involve it in a search for the 
tallest man.  We didn't want a mere process for the selection of 
good as distinguished from gifted and able boys--"No, you DON'T," 
from Dayton--we wanted all the brilliant stuff in the world 
concentrated upon the development of the world.  Just to exasperate 
Dayton further I put in a plea for gifts as against character in 
educational, artistic, and legislative work.  "Good teaching," I 
said, "is better than good conduct.  We are becoming idiotic about 
character."
<P>
Dayton was too moved to speak.  He slewed round upon me an eye of 
agonised aversion.
<P>
I expatiated on the small proportion of the available ability that 
is really serving humanity to-day.  "I suppose to-day all the 
thought, all the art, all the increments of knowledge that matter, 
are supplied so far as the English-speaking community is concerned 
by--how many?--by three or four thousand individuals.  ('Less,' said 
Thorns.)  To be more precise, by the mental hinterlands of three or 
four thousand individuals.  We who know some of the band entertain 
no illusions as to their innate rarity.  We know that they are just 
the few out of many, the few who got in our world of chance and 
confusion, the timely stimulus, the apt suggestion at the fortunate 
moment, the needed training, the leisure.  The rest are lost in the 
crowd, fail through the defects of their qualities, become 
commonplace workmen and second-rate professional men, marry 
commonplace wives, are as much waste as the driftage of superfluous 
pollen in a pine forest is waste."
<P>
"Decent honest lives!" said Dayton to his bread-crumbs, with his 
chin in his necktie.  "WASTE!"
<P>
"And the people who do get what we call opportunity get it usually 
in extremely limited and cramping forms.  No man lives a life of 
intellectual productivity alone; he needs not only material and 
opportunity, but helpers, resonators.  Round and about what I might 
call the REAL men, you want the sympathetic cooperators, who help by 
understanding.  It isn't that our--SALT of three or four thousand is 
needlessly rare; it is sustained by far too small and 
undifferentiated a public.  Most of the good men we know are not 
really doing the very best work of their gifts; nearly all are a 
little adapted, most are shockingly adapted to some second-best use.  
Now, I take it, this is the very centre and origin of the muddle, 
futility, and unhappiness that distresses us; it's the cardinal 
problem of the state--to discover, develop, and use the exceptional 
gifts of men.  And I see that best done--I drift more and more away 
from the common stuff of legislative and administrative activity--by 
a quite revolutionary development of the educational machinery, but 
by a still more unprecedented attempt to keep science going, to keep 
literature going, and to keep what is the necessary spur of all 
science and literature, an intelligent and appreciative criticism 
going.  You know none of these things have ever been kept going 
hitherto; they've come unexpectedly and inexplicably."
<P>
"Hear, hear!" from Dayton, cough, nodding of the head, and an 
expression of mystical profundity.
<P>
"They've lit up a civilisation and vanished, to give place to 
darkness again.  Now the modern state doesn't mean to go back to 
darkness again--and so it's got to keep its light burning."  I went 
on to attack the present organisation of our schools and 
universities, which seemed elaborately designed to turn the well-
behaved, uncritical, and uncreative men of each generation into the 
authoritative leaders of the next, and I suggested remedies upon 
lines that I have already indicated in the earlier chapters of this 
story. . . .
<P>
So far I had the substance of the club with me, but I opened new 
ground and set Crupp agog by confessing my doubt from which party or 
combination of groups these developments of science and literature 
and educational organisation could most reasonably be expected.  I 
looked up to find Crupp's dark little eye intent upon me.
<P>
There I left it to them.
<P>
We had an astonishingly good discussion; Neal burst once, but we 
emerged from his flood after a time, and Dayton had his interlude.  
The rest was all close, keen examination of my problem.
<P>
I see Crupp now with his arm bent before him on the table in a way 
we had, as though it was jointed throughout its length like a 
lobster's antenna, his plump, short-fingered hand crushing up a 
walnut shell into smaller and smaller fragments.  "Remington," he 
said, "has given us the data for a movement, a really possible 
movement.  It's not only possible, but necessary--urgently 
necessary, I think, if the Empire is to go on."
<P>
"We're working altogether too much at the social basement in 
education and training," said Gane.  "Remington is right about our 
neglect of the higher levels."
<P>
Britten made a good contribution with an analysis of what he called 
the spirit of a country and what made it.  "The modern community 
needs its serious men to be artistic and its artists to be taken 
seriously," I remember his saying.  "The day has gone by for either 
dull responsibility or merely witty art."
<P>
I remember very vividly how Shoesmith harped on an idea I had thrown 
out of using some sort of review or weekly to express and elaborate 
these conceptions of a new, severer, aristocratic culture.
<P>
"It would have to be done amazingly well," said Britten, and my mind 
went back to my school days and that ancient enterprise of ours, and 
how Cossington had rushed it.  Well, Cossington had too many papers 
nowadays to interfere with us, and we perhaps had learnt some 
defensive devices.
<P>
"But this thing has to be linked to some political party," said 
Crupp, with his eye on me.  "You can't get away from that.  The 
Liberals," he added, "have never done anything for research or 
literature."
<P>
"They had a Royal Commission on the Dramatic Censorship," said 
Thorns, with a note of minute fairness.  "It shows what they were 
made of," he added.
<P>
"It's what I've told Remington again and again," said Crupp, "we've 
got to pick up the tradition of aristocracy, reorganise it, and make 
it work.  But he's certainly suggested a method."
<P>
"There won't be much aristocracy to pick up," said Dayton, darkly to 
the ceiling, "if the House of Lords throws out the Budget."
<P>
"All the more reason for picking it up," said Neal.  "For we can't 
do without it."
<P>
"Will they go to the bad, or will they rise from the ashes, 
aristocrats indeed--if the Liberals come in overwhelmingly?" said 
Britten.
<P>
"It's we who might decide that," said Crupp, insidiously.
<P>
"I agree," said Gane.
<P>
"No one can tell," said Thorns.  "I doubt if they will get beaten."
<P>
It was an odd, fragmentary discussion that night.  We were all with 
ideas in our minds at once fine and imperfect.  We threw out 
suggestions that showed themselves at once far inadequate, and we 
tried to qualify them by minor self-contradictions.  Britten, I 
think, got more said than any one.  "You all seem to think you want 
to organise people, particular groups and classes of individuals," 
he insisted.  "It isn't that.  That's the standing error of 
politicians.  You want to organise a culture.  Civilisation isn't a 
matter of concrete groupings; it's a matter of prevailing ideas.  
The problem is how to make bold, clear ideas prevail.  The question 
for Remington and us is just what groups of people will most help 
this culture forward."
<P>
"Yes, but how are the Lords going to behave?" said Crupp.  "You 
yourself were asking that a little while ago."
<P>
"If they win or if they lose," Gane maintained, "there will be a 
movement to reorganise aristocracy--Reform of the House of Lords, 
they'll call the political form of it."
<P>
"Bailey thinks that," said some one.
<P>
"The labour people want abolition," said some one.  "Let 'em," said 
Thorns.
<P>
He became audible, sketching a possibility of action.
<P>
"Suppose all of us were able to work together.  It's just one of 
those indeterminate, confused, eventful times ahead when a steady 
jet of ideas might produce enormous results."
<P>
"Leave me out of it," said Dayton, "IF you please."
<P>
"We should," said Thorns under his breath.
<P>
I took up Crupp's initiative, I remember, and expanded it.
<P>
"I believe we could do--extensive things," I insisted.
<P>
"Revivals and revisions of Toryism have been tried so often," said 
Thorns, "from the Young England movement onward."
<P>
"Not one but has produced its enduring effects," I said.  "It's the 
peculiarity of English conservatism that it's persistently 
progressive and rejuvenescent."
<P>
I think it must have been about that point that Dayton fled our 
presence, after some clumsy sentence that I decided upon reflection 
was intended to remind me of my duty to my party.
<P>
Then I remember Thorns firing doubts at me obliquely across the 
table.  "You can't run a country through its spoilt children," he 
said.  "What you call aristocrats are really spoilt children.  
They've had too much of everything, except bracing experience."
<P>
"Children can always be educated," said Crupp.
<P>
"I said SPOILT children," said Thorns.
<P>
"Look here, Thorns!" said I.  "If this Budget row leads to a storm, 
and these big people get their power clipped, what's going to 
happen?  Have you thought of that?  When they go out lock, stock, 
and barrel, who comes in?"
<P>
"Nature abhors a Vacuum," said Crupp, supporting me.
<P>
"Bailey's trained officials," suggested Gane.
<P>
"Quacks with a certificate of approval from Altiora," said Thorns.  
"I admit the horrors of the alternative.  There'd be a massacre in 
three years."
<P>
"One may go on trying possibilities for ever," I said.  "One thing 
emerges.  Whatever accidents happen, our civilisation needs, and 
almost consciously needs, a culture of fine creative minds, and all 
the necessary tolerances, opennesses, considerations, that march 
with that.  For my own part, I think that is the Most Vital Thing.  
Build your ship of state as you will; get your men as you will; I 
concentrate on what is clearly the affair of my sort of man,--I want 
to ensure the quality of the quarter deck."
<P>
"Hear, hear!" said Shoesmith, suddenly--his first remark for a long 
time.  "A first-rate figure," said Shoesmith, gripping it.
<P>
"Our danger is in missing that," I went on.  "Muddle isn't ended by 
transferring power from the muddle-headed few to the muddle-headed 
many, and then cheating the many out of it again in the interests of 
a bureaucracy of sham experts.  But that seems the limit of the 
liberal imagination.  There is no real progress in a country, except 
a rise in the level of its free intellectual activity.  All other 
progress is secondary and dependant.  If you take on Bailey's dreams 
of efficient machinery and a sort of fanatical discipline with no 
free-moving brains behind it, confused ugliness becomes rigid 
ugliness,--that's all.  No doubt things are moving from looseness to 
discipline, and from irresponsible controls to organised controls--
and also and rather contrariwise everything is becoming as people 
say, democratised; but all the more need in that, for an ark in 
which the living element may be saved."
<P>
"Hear, hear!" said Shoesmith, faint but pursuing.
<P>
It must have been in my house afterwards that Shoesmith became 
noticeable.  He seemed trying to say something vague and difficult 
that he didn't get said at all on that occasion.  "We could do 
immense things with a weekly," he repeated, echoing Neal, I think.  
And there he left off and became a mute expressiveness, and it was 
only afterwards, when I was in bed, that I saw we had our capitalist 
in our hands. . . .
<P>
We parted that night on my doorstep in a tremendous glow--but in 
that sort of glow one doesn't act upon without much reconsideration, 
and it was some months before I made my decision to follow up the 
indications of that opening talk.
<P>

<P>
I find my thoughts lingering about the Pentagram Circle.  In my 
developments it played a large part, not so much by starting new 
trains of thought as by confirming the practicability of things I 
had already hesitatingly entertained.  Discussion with these other 
men so prominently involved in current affairs endorsed views that 
otherwise would have seemed only a little less remote from actuality 
than the guardians of Plato or the labour laws of More.  Among other 
questions that were never very distant from our discussions, that 
came apt to every topic, was the true significance of democracy, 
Tariff Reform as a method of international hostility, and the 
imminence of war.  On the first issue I can still recall little 
Bailey, glib and winking, explaining that democracy was really just 
a dodge for getting assent to the ordinances of the expert official 
by means of the polling booth.  "If they don't like things," said 
he, "they can vote for the opposition candidate and see what happens 
then--and that, you see, is why we don't want proportional 
representation to let in the wild men."  I opened my eyes--the lids 
had dropped for a moment under the caress of those smooth sounds--to 
see if Bailey's artful forefinger wasn't at the side of his 
predominant nose.
<P>
The international situation exercised us greatly.  Our meetings were 
pervaded by the feeling that all things moved towards a day of 
reckoning with Germany, and I was largely instrumental in keeping up 
the suggestion that India was in a state of unstable equilibrium, 
that sooner or later something must happen there--something very 
serious to our Empire.  Dayton frankly detested these topics.  He 
was full of that old Middle Victorian persuasion that whatever is 
inconvenient or disagreeable to the English mind could be 
annihilated by not thinking about it.  He used to sit low in his 
chair and look mulish.  "Militarism," he would declare in a tone of 
the utmost moral fervour, is a curse.  It's an unmitigated curse."  
Then he would cough shortly and twitch his head back and frown, and 
seem astonished beyond measure that after this conclusive statement 
we could still go on talking of war.
<P>
All our Imperialists were obsessed by the thought of international 
conflict, and their influence revived for a time those uneasinesses 
that had been aroused in me for the first time by my continental 
journey with Willersley and by Meredith's "One of Our Conquerors."  
That quite justifiable dread of a punishment for all the slackness, 
mental dishonesty, presumption, mercenary respectability and 
sentimentalised commercialism of the Victorian period, at the hands 
of the better organised, more vigorous, and now far more highly 
civilised peoples of Central Europe, seemed to me to have both a 
good and bad series of consequences.  It seemed the only thing 
capable of bracing English minds to education, sustained 
constructive effort and research; but on the other hand it produced 
the quality of a panic, hasty preparation, impatience of thought, a 
wasteful and sometimes quite futile immediacy.  In 1909, for 
example, there was a vast clamour for eight additional Dreadnoughts--
<P>
<P>
     "We want eight
      And we won't wait,"
<P>
<P>
but no clamour at all about our national waste of inventive talent, 
our mean standard of intellectual attainment, our disingenuous 
criticism, and the consequent failure to distinguish men of the 
quality needed to carry on the modern type of war.  Almost 
universally we have the wrong men in our places of responsibility 
and the right men in no place at all, almost universally we have 
poorly qualified, hesitating, and resentful subordinates, because 
our criticism is worthless and, so habitually as to be now almost 
unconsciously, dishonest.  Germany is beating England in every 
matter upon which competition is possible, because she attended 
sedulously to her collective mind for sixty pregnant years, because 
in spite of tremendous defects she is still far more anxious for 
quality in achievement than we are.  I remember saying that in my 
paper.  From that, I remember, I went on to an image that had 
flashed into my mind.  "The British Empire," I said, "is like some 
of those early vertebrated monsters, the Brontosaurus and the 
Atlantosaurus and such-like; it sacrifices intellect to character; 
its backbone, that is to say,--especially in the visceral region--is 
bigger than its cranium.  It's no accident that things are so.  
We've worked for backbone.  We brag about backbone, and if the 
joints are anchylosed so much the better.  We're still but only half 
awake to our error.  You can't change that suddenly."
<P>
"Turn it round and make it go backwards," interjected Thorns.
<P>
"It's trying to do that," I said, "in places."
<P>
And afterwards Crupp declared I had begotten a nightmare which 
haunted him of nights; he was trying desperately and belatedly to 
blow a brain as one blows soap-bubbles on such a mezoroic saurian as 
I had conjured up, while the clumsy monster's fate, all teeth and 
brains, crept nearer and nearer. . . .
<P>
I've grown, I think, since those days out of the urgency of that 
apprehension.  I still think a European war, and conceivably a very 
humiliating war for England, may occur at no very distant date, but 
I do not think there is any such heroic quality in our governing 
class as will make that war catastrophic.  The prevailing spirit in 
English life--it is one of the essential secrets of our imperial 
endurance--is one of underbred aggression in prosperity and 
diplomatic compromise in moments of danger; we bully haughtily where 
we can and assimilate where we must.  It is not for nothing that our 
upper and middle-class youth is educated by teachers of the highest 
character, scholars and gentlemen, men who can pretend quite 
honestly that Darwinism hasn't upset the historical fall of man, 
that cricket is moral training, and that Socialism is an outrage 
upon the teachings of Christ.  A sort of dignified dexterity of 
evasion is the national reward.  Germany, with a larger population, 
a vigorous and irreconcilable proletariat, a bolder intellectual 
training, a harsher spirit, can scarcely fail to drive us at last to 
a realisation of intolerable strain.  So we may never fight at all.  
The war of preparations that has been going on for thirty years may 
end like a sham-fight at last in an umpire's decision.  We shall 
proudly but very firmly take the second place.  For my own part, 
since I love England as much as I detest her present lethargy of 
soul, I pray for a chastening war--I wouldn't mind her flag in the 
dirt if only her spirit would come out of it.  So I was able to 
shake off that earlier fear of some final and irrevocable 
destruction truncating all my schemes.  At the most, a European war 
would be a dramatic episode in the reconstruction I had in view.
<P>
In India, too, I no longer foresee, as once I was inclined to see, 
disaster.  The English rule in India is surely one of the most 
extraordinary accidents that has ever happened in history.  We are 
there like a man who has fallen off a ladder on to the neck of an 
elephant, and doesn't know what to do or how to get down.  Until 
something happens he remains.  Our functions in India are absurd.  
We English do not own that country, do not even rule it.  We make 
nothing happen; at the most we prevent things happening.  We 
suppress our own literature there.  Most English people cannot even 
go to this land they possess; the authorities would prevent it.  If 
Messrs. Perowne or Cook organised a cheap tour of Manchester 
operatives, it would be stopped.  No one dare bring the average 
English voter face to face with the reality of India, or let the 
Indian native have a glimpse of the English voter.  In my time I 
have talked to English statesmen, Indian officials and ex-officials, 
viceroys, soldiers, every one who might be supposed to know what 
India signifies, and I have prayed them to tell me what they thought 
we were up to there.  I am not writing without my book in these 
matters.  And beyond a phrase or so about "even-handed justice"--and 
look at our sedition trials!--they told me nothing.  Time after time 
I have heard of that apocryphal native ruler in the north-west, who, 
when asked what would happen if we left India, replied that in a 
week his men would be in the saddle, and in six months not a rupee 
nor a virgin would he left in Lower Bengal.  That is always given as 
our conclusive justification.  But is it our business to preserve 
the rupees and virgins of Lower Bengal in a sort of magic 
inconclusiveness?  Better plunder than paralysis, better fire and 
sword than futility.  Our flag is spread over the peninsula, without 
plans, without intentions--a vast preventive.  The sum total of our 
policy is to arrest any discussion, any conferences that would 
enable the Indians to work out a tolerable scheme of the future for 
themselves.  But that does not arrest the resentment of men held 
back from life.  Consider what it must be for the educated Indian 
sitting at the feast of contemporary possibilities with his mouth 
gagged and his hands bound behind him!  The spirit of insurrection 
breaks out in spite of espionage and seizures.  Our conflict for 
inaction develops stupendous absurdities.  The other day the British 
Empire was taking off and examining printed cotton stomach wraps for 
seditious emblems and inscriptions. . . .
<P>
In some manner we shall have to come out of India.  We have had our 
chance, and we have demonstrated nothing but the appalling dulness 
of our national imagination.  We are not good enough to do anything 
with India.  Codger and Flack, and Gates and Dayton, Cladingbowl in 
the club, and the HOME CHURCHMAN in the home, cant about 
"character," worship of strenuous force and contempt of truth; for 
the sake of such men and things as these, we must abandon in fact, 
if not in appearance, that empty domination.  Had we great schools 
and a powerful teaching, could we boast great men, had we the spirit 
of truth and creation in our lives, then indeed it might be 
different.  But a race that bears a sceptre must carry gifts to 
justify it.
<P>
It does not follow that we shall be driven catastrophically from 
India.  That was my earlier mistake.  We are not proud enough in our 
bones to be ruined by India as Spain was by her empire.  We may be 
able to abandon India with an air of still remaining there.  It is 
our new method.  We train our future rulers in the public schools to 
have a very wholesome respect for strength, and as soon as a power 
arises in India in spite of us, be it a man or a culture, or a 
native state, we shall he willing to deal with it.  We may or may 
not have a war, but our governing class will be quick to learn when 
we are beaten.  Then they will repeat our South African diplomacy, 
and arrange for some settlement that will abandon the reality, such 
as it is, and preserve the semblance of power.  The conqueror DE 
FACTO will become the new "loyal Briton," and the democracy at home 
will be invited to celebrate our recession--triumphantly.  I am no 
believer in the imminent dissolution of our Empire; I am less and 
less inclined to see in either India or Germany the probability of 
an abrupt truncation of those slow intellectual and moral 
constructions which are the essentials of statecraft.

I sit writing in this little loggia to the sound of dripping water--
this morning we had rain, and the roof of our little casa is still 
not dry, there are pools in the rocks under the sweet chestnuts, and 
the torrent that crosses the salita is full and boastful,--and I try 
to recall the order of my impressions during that watching, dubious 
time, before I went over to the Conservative Party.  I was trying--
chaotic task--to gauge the possibilities inherent in the quality of 
the British aristocracy.  There comes a broad spectacular effect of 
wide parks, diversified by woods and bracken valleys, and dappled 
with deer; of great smooth lawns shaded by ancient trees; of big 
facades of sunlit buildings dominating the country side; of large 
fine rooms full of handsome, easy-mannered people.  As a sort of 
representative picture to set off against those other pictures of 
Liberals and of Socialists I have given, I recall one of those huge 
assemblies the Duchess of Clynes inaugurated at Stamford House.  The 
place itself is one of the vastest private houses in London, a huge 
clustering mass of white and gold saloons with polished floors and 
wonderful pictures, and staircases and galleries on a Gargantuan 
scale.  And there she sought to gather all that was most 
representative of English activities, and did, in fact, in those 
brilliant nocturnal crowds, get samples of nearly every section of 
our social and intellectual life, with a marked predominance upon 
the political and social side.
<P>
I remember sitting in one of the recesses at the end of the big 
saloon with Mrs. Redmondson, one of those sharp-minded, beautiful 
rich women one meets so often in London, who seem to have done 
nothing and to be capable of everything, and we watched the crowd--
uniforms and splendours were streaming in from a State ball--and 
exchanged information.  I told her about the politicians and 
intellectuals, and she told me about the aristocrats, and we 
sharpened our wit on them and counted the percentage of beautiful 
people among the latter, and wondered if the general effect of 
tallness was or was not an illusion.
<P>
They were, we agreed, for the most part bigger than the average of 
people in London, and a handsome lot, even when they were not subtly 
individualised.  "They look so well nurtured," I said, "well cared 
for.  I like their quiet, well-trained movements, their pleasant 
consideration for each other."
<P>
"Kindly, good tempered, and at bottom utterly selfish," she said, 
"like big, rather carefully trained, rather pampered children.  What 
else can you expect from them?"
<P>
"They are good tempered, anyhow," I witnessed, "and that's an 
achievement.  I don't think I could ever be content under a bad-
tempered, sentimentalism, strenuous Government.  That's why I 
couldn't stand the Roosevelt REGIME in America.  One's chief 
surprise when one comes across these big people for the first time 
is their admirable easiness and a real personal modesty.  I confess 
I admire them.  Oh! I like them.  I wouldn't at all mind, I believe, 
giving over the country to this aristocracy--given SOMETHING--"
<P>
"Which they haven't got."
<P>
"Which they haven't got--or they'd be the finest sort of people in 
the world."
<P>
"That something?" she inquired.
<P>
"I don't know.  I've been puzzling my wits to know.  They've done 
all sorts of things--"
<P>
"That's Lord Wrassleton," she interrupted, "whose leg was broken--
you remember?--at Spion Kop."
<P>
"It's healed very well.  I like the gold lace and the white glove 
resting, with quite a nice awkwardness, on the sword.  When I was a 
little boy I wanted to wear clothes like that.  And the stars!  He's 
got the V. C.  Most of these people here have at any rate shown 
pluck, you know--brought something off."
<P>
"Not quite enough," she suggested.
<P>
"I think that's it," I said.  "Not quite enough--not quite hard 
enough," I added.
<P>
She laughed and looked at me.  "You'd like to make us," she said.
<P>
"What?"
<P>
"Hard."
<P>
"I don't think you'll go on if you don't get hard."
<P>
"We shan't be so pleasant if we do."
<P>
"Well, there my puzzled wits come in again.  I don't see why an 
aristocracy shouldn't be rather hard trained, and yet kindly.  I'm 
not convinced that the resources of education are exhausted.  I want 
to better this, because it already looks so good."
<P>
"How are we to do it?" asked Mrs. Redmondson.
<P>
"Oh, there you have me!  I've been spending my time lately in trying 
to answer that!  It makes me quarrel with"--I held up my fingers and 
ticked the items off--"the public schools, the private tutors, the 
army exams, the Universities, the Church, the general attitude of 
the country towards science and literature--"
<P>
"We all do," said Mrs. Redmondson.  "We can't begin again at the 
beginning," she added.
<P>
"Couldn't one," I nodded at the assembly in general, start a 
movement?
<P>
"There's the Confederates," she said, with a faint smile that masked 
a gleam of curiosity. . . .  "You want," she said, "to say to the 
aristocracy, 'Be aristocrats.  NOBLESSE OBLIGE.'  Do you remember 
what happened to the monarch who was told to 'Be a King'?"
<P>
"Well," I said, "I want an aristocracy."
<P>
"This," she said, smiling, "is the pick of them.  The backwoodsmen 
are off the stage.  These are the brilliant ones--the smart and the 
blues. . . .  They cost a lot of money, you know."
<P>
So far Mrs. Redmondson, but the picture remained full of things not 
stated in our speech.  They were on the whole handsome people, 
charitable minded, happy, and easy.  They led spacious lives, and 
there was something free and fearless about their bearing that I 
liked extremely.  The women particularly were wide-reading, fine-
thinking.  Mrs. Redmondson talked as fully and widely and boldly as 
a man, and with those flashes of intuition, those startling, sudden 
delicacies of perception few men display.  I liked, too, the 
relations that held between women and men, their general tolerance, 
their antagonism to the harsh jealousies that are the essence of the 
middle-class order. . . .
<P>
After all, if one's aim resolved itself into the development of a 
type and culture of men, why shouldn't one begin at this end?
<P>
It is very easy indeed to generalise about a class or human beings, 
but much harder to produce a sample.  Was old Lady Forthundred, for 
instance, fairly a sample?  I remember her as a smiling, magnificent 
presence, a towering accumulation of figure and wonderful shimmering 
blue silk and black lace and black hair, and small fine features and 
chins and chins and chins, disposed in a big cane chair with wraps 
and cushions upon the great terrace of Champneys.  Her eye was blue 
and hard, and her accent and intonation were exactly what you would 
expect from a rather commonplace dressmaker pretending to be 
aristocratic.  I was, I am afraid, posing a little as the 
intelligent but respectful inquirer from below investigating the 
great world, and she was certainly posing as my informant.  She 
affected a cynical coarseness.  She developed a theory on the 
governance of England, beautifully frank and simple.  "Give 'um all 
a peerage when they get twenty thousand a year," she maintained.  
"That's my remedy."
<P>
In my new role of theoretical aristocrat I felt a little abashed.
<P>
"Twenty thousand," she repeated with conviction.
<P>
It occurred to me that I was in the presence of the aristocratic 
theory currently working as distinguished from my as yet 
unformulated intentions.
<P>
"You'll get a lot of loafers and scamps among 'um," said Lady 
Forthundred.  "You get loafers and scamps everywhere, but you'll get 
a lot of men who'll work hard to keep things together, and that's 
what we're all after, isn't ut?
<P>
"It's not an ideal arrangement."
<P>
"Tell me anything better," said Lady Forthundred.
<P>
On the whole, and because she refused emphatically to believe in 
education, Lady Forthundred scored.
<P>
We had been discussing Cossington's recent peerage, for Cossington, 
my old schoolfellow at City Merchants', and my victor in the affair 
of the magazine, had clambered to an amazing wealth up a piled heap 
of energetically pushed penny and halfpenny magazines, and a group 
of daily newspapers.  I had expected to find the great lady hostile 
to the new-comer, but she accepted him, she gloried in him.
<P>
"We're a peerage," she said, "but none of us have ever had any 
nonsense about nobility."
<P>
She turned and smiled down on me.  "We English," she said, "are a 
practical people.  We assimilate 'um."
<P>
"Then, I suppose, they don't give trouble?"
<P>
"Then they don't give trouble."
<P>
"They learn to shoot?"
<P>
"And all that," said Lady Forthundred.  "Yes.  And things go on.  
Sometimes better than others, but they go on--somehow.  It depends 
very much on the sort of butler who pokes 'um about."
<P>
I suggested that it might be possible to get a secure twenty 
thousand a year by at least detrimental methods--socially speaking.
<P>
"We must take the bad and the good of 'um," said Lady Forthundred, 
courageously. . . .
<P>
Now, was she a sample?  It happened she talked.  What was there in 
the brains of the multitude of her first, second, third, fourth, and 
fifth cousins, who didn't talk, who shone tall, and bearing 
themselves finely, against a background of deft, attentive maids and 
valets, on every spacious social scene?  How did things look to 
them?
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Side by side with Lady Forthundred, it is curious to put Evesham 
with his tall, bent body, his little-featured almost elvish face, 
his unequal mild brown eyes, his gentle manner, his sweet, amazing 
oratory.  He led all these people wonderfully.  He was always 
curious and interested about life, wary beneath a pleasing 
frankness--and I tormented my brain to get to the bottom of him.  
For a long time he was the most powerful man in England under the 
throne; he had the Lords in his hand, and a great majority in the 
Commons, and the discontents and intrigues that are the concomitants 
of an overwhelming party advantage broke against him as waves break 
against a cliff.  He foresaw so far in these matters that it seemed 
he scarcely troubled to foresee.  He brought political art to the 
last triumph of naturalness.  Always for me he has been the typical 
aristocrat, so typical and above the mere forms of aristocracy, that 
he remained a commoner to the end of his days.
<P>
I had met him at the beginning of my career; he read some early 
papers of mine, and asked to see me, and I conceived a flattered 
liking for him that strengthened to a very strong feeling indeed.  
He seemed to me to stand alone without an equal, the greatest man in 
British political life.  Some men one sees through and understands, 
some one cannot see into or round because they are of opaque clay, 
but about Evesham I had a sense of things hidden as it were by depth 
and mists, because he was so big and atmospheric a personality.  No 
other contemporary has had that effect upon me.  I've sat beside him 
at dinners, stayed in houses with him--he was in the big house party 
at Champneys--talked to him, sounded him, watching him as I sat 
beside him.  I could talk to him with extraordinary freedom and a 
rare sense of being understood.  Other men have to be treated in a 
special manner; approached through their own mental dialect, 
flattered by a minute regard for what they have said and done.  
Evesham was as widely and charitably receptive as any man I have 
ever met.  The common politicians beside him seemed like rows of 
stuffy little rooms looking out upon the sea.
<P>
And what was he up to?  What did HE think we were doing with 
Mankind?  That I thought worth knowing.
<P>
I remember his talking on one occasion at the Hartsteins', at a 
dinner so tremendously floriferous and equipped that we were almost 
forced into duologues, about the possible common constructive 
purpose in politics.
<P>
"I feel so much," he said, "that the best people in every party 
converge.  We don't differ at Westminster as they do in the country 
towns.  There's a sort of extending common policy that goes on under 
every government, because on the whole it's the right thing to do, 
and people know it.  Things that used to be matters of opinion 
become matters of science--and cease to be party questions."
<P>
He instanced education.
<P>
"Apart," said I, "from the religious question."
<P>
"Apart from the religious question."
<P>
He dropped that aspect with an easy grace, and went on with his 
general theme that political conflict was the outcome of 
uncertainty.  "Directly you get a thing established, so that people 
can say, 'Now this is Right,' with the same conviction that people 
can say water is a combination of oxygen and hydrogen, there's no 
more to be said.  The thing has to be done. . . ." 
<P>
And to put against this effect of Evesham, broad and humanely 
tolerant, posing as the minister of a steadily developing 
constructive conviction, there are other memories.
<P>
Have I not seen him in the House, persistent, persuasive, 
indefatigable, and by all my standards wickedly perverse, leaning 
over the table with those insistent movements of his hand upon it, 
or swaying forward with a grip upon his coat lapel, fighting with a 
diabolical skill to preserve what are in effect religious tests, 
tests he must have known would outrage and humiliate and injure the 
consciences of a quarter--and that perhaps the best quarter--of the 
youngsters who come to the work of elementary education?
<P>
In playing for points in the game of party advantage Evesham 
displayed at times a quite wicked unscrupulousness in the use of his 
subtle mind.  I would sit on the Liberal benches and watch him, and 
listen to his urbane voice, fascinated by him.  Did he really care?  
Did anything matter to him?  And if it really mattered nothing, why 
did he trouble to serve the narrowness and passion of his side?  Or 
did he see far beyond my scope, so that this petty iniquity was 
justified by greater, remoter ends of which I had no intimation?
<P>
They accused him of nepotism.  His friends and family were certainly 
well cared for.  In private life he was full of an affectionate 
intimacy; he pleased by being charmed and pleased.  One might think 
at times there was no more of him than a clever man happily 
circumstanced, and finding an interest and occupation in politics.  
And then came a glimpse of thought, of imagination, like the sight 
of a soaring eagle through a staircase skylight.  Oh, beyond 
question he was great!  No other contemporary politician had his 
quality.  In no man have I perceived so sympathetically the great 
contrast between warm, personal things and the white dream of 
statecraft.  Except that he had it seemed no hot passions, but only 
interests and fine affections and indolences, he paralleled the 
conflict of my life.  He saw and thought widely and deeply; but at 
times it seemed to me his greatness stood over and behind the 
reality of his life, like some splendid servant, thinking his own 
thoughts, who waits behind a lesser master's chair. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
8
<P>
<P>
Of course, when Evesham talked of this ideal of the organised state 
becoming so finely true to practicability and so clearly stated as 
to have the compelling conviction of physical science, he spoke 
quite after my heart.  Had he really embodied the attempt to realise 
that, I could have done no more than follow him blindly.  But 
neither he nor I embodied that, and there lies the gist of my story.  
And when it came to a study of others among the leading Tories and 
Imperialists the doubt increased, until with some at last it was 
possible to question whether they had any imaginative conception of 
constructive statecraft at all; whether they didn't opaquely accept 
the world for what it was, and set themselves single-mindedly to 
make a place for themselves and cut a figure in it.
<P>
There were some very fine personalities among them: there were the 
great peers who had administered Egypt, India, South Africa, 
Framboya--Cromer, Kitchener, Curzon, Milner, Gane, for example.  So 
far as that easier task of holding sword and scales had gone, they 
had shown the finest qualities, but they had returned to the 
perplexing and exacting problem of the home country, a little 
glorious, a little too simply bold.  They wanted to arm and they 
wanted to educate, but the habit of immediate necessity made them 
far more eager to arm than to educate, and their experience of 
heterogeneous controls made them overrate the need for obedience in 
a homogeneous country.  They didn't understand raw men, ill-trained 
men, uncertain minds, and intelligent women; and these are the 
things that matter in England. . . .  There were also the great 
business adventurers, from Cranber to Cossington (who was now Lord 
Paddockhurst).  My mind remained unsettled, and went up and down the 
scale between a belief in their far-sighted purpose and the 
perception of crude vanities, coarse ambitions, vulgar 
competitiveness, and a mere habitual persistence in the pursuit of 
gain.  For a time I saw a good deal of Cossington--I wish I had kept 
a diary of his talk and gestures, to mark how he could vary from day 
to day between a POSEUR, a smart tradesman, and a very bold and 
wide-thinking political schemer.  He had a vanity of sweeping 
actions, motor car pounces, Napoleonic rushes, that led to violent 
ineffectual changes in the policy of his papers, and a haunting 
pursuit by parallel columns in the liberal press that never abashed 
him in the slightest degree.  By an accident I plumbed the folly in 
him--but I feel I never plumbed his wisdom.  I remember him one day 
after a lunch at the Barhams' saying suddenly, out of profound 
meditation over the end of a cigar, one of those sentences that seem 
to light the whole interior being of a man.  "Some day," he said 
softly, rather to himself than to me, and A PROPOS of nothing--"some 
day I will raise the country."
<P>
"Why not?" I said, after a pause, and leant across him for the 
little silver spirit-lamp, to light my cigarette. . . .
<P>
Then the Tories had for another section the ancient creations, and 
again there were the financial peers, men accustomed to reserve, and 
their big lawyers, accustomed to--well, qualified statement.  And 
below the giant personalities of the party were the young bloods, 
young, adventurous men of the type of Lord Tarvrille, who had seen 
service in South Africa, who had travelled and hunted; explorers, 
keen motorists, interested in aviation, active in army organisation.  
Good, brown-faced stuff they were, but impervious to ideas outside 
the range of their activities, more ignorant of science than their 
chaffeurs, and of the quality of English people than welt-
politicians; contemptuous of school and university by reason of the 
Gateses and Flacks and Codgers who had come their way, witty, light-
hearted, patriotic at the Kipling level, with a certain aptitude for 
bullying.  They varied in insensible gradations between the noble 
sportsmen on the one hand, and men like Gane and the Tories of our 
Pentagram club on the other.  You perceive how a man might exercise 
his mind in the attempt to strike an average of public 
serviceability in this miscellany!  And mixed up with these, mixed 
up sometimes in the same man, was the pure reactionary, whose 
predominant idea was that the village schools should confine 
themselves to teaching the catechism, hat-touching and courtesying, 
and be given a holiday whenever beaters were in request. . . .
<P>
I find now in my mind as a sort of counterpoise to Evesham the 
figure of old Lord Wardingham, asleep in the largest armchair in the 
library of Stamford Court after lunch.  One foot rested on one of 
those things--I think they are called gout stools.  He had been 
playing golf all the morning and wearied a weak instep; at lunch he 
had sat at my table and talked in the overbearing manner permitted 
to irascible important men whose insteps are painful.  Among other 
things he had flouted the idea that women would ever understand 
statecraft or be more than a nuisance in politics, denied flatly 
that Hindoos were capable of anything whatever except excesses in 
population, regretted he could not censor picture galleries and 
circulating libraries, and declared that dissenters were people who 
pretended to take theology seriously with the express purpose of 
upsetting the entirely satisfactory compromise of the Established 
Church.  "No sensible people, with anything to gain or lose, argue 
about religion," he said.  "They mean mischief."  Having delivered 
his soul upon these points, and silenced the little conversation to 
the left of him from which they had arisen, he became, after an 
appreciative encounter with a sanguinary woodcock, more amiable, 
responded to some respectful initiatives of Crupp's, and related a 
number of classical anecdotes of those blighting snubs, vindictive 
retorts and scandalous miscarriages of justice that are so dear to 
the forensic mind.  Now he reposed.  He was breathing heavily with 
his mouth a little open and his head on one side.  One whisker was 
turned back against the comfortable padding.  His plump strong hands 
gripped the arms of his chair, and his frown was a little assuaged.  
How tremendously fed up he looked!  Honours, wealth, influence, 
respect, he had them all.  How scornful and hard it had made his 
unguarded expression!
<P>
I note without comment that it didn't even occur to me then to wake 
him up and ask him what HE was up to with mankind.

One countervailing influence to my drift to Toryism in those days 
was Margaret's quite religious faith in the Liberals.  I realised 
that slowly and with a mild astonishment.  It set me, indeed, even 
then questioning my own change of opinion.  We came at last 
incidentally, as our way was, to an exchange of views.  It was as 
nearly a quarrel as we had before I came over to the Conservative 
side.  It was at Champneys, and I think during the same visit that 
witnessed my exploration of Lady Forthundred.  It arose indirectly, 
I think, out of some comments of mine upon our fellow-guests, but it 
is one of those memories of which the scene and quality remain more 
vivid than the things said, a memory without any very definite 
beginning or end.  It was afternoon, in the pause between tea and 
the dressing bell, and we were in Margaret's big silver-adorned, 
chintz-bright room, looking out on the trim Italian garden. . . .  
Yes, the beginning of it has escaped me altogether, but I remember 
it as an odd exceptional little wrangle.
<P>
At first we seem to have split upon the moral quality of the 
aristocracy, and I had an odd sense that in some way too feminine 
for me to understand our hostess had aggrieved her.  She said, I 
know, that Champneys distressed her; made her "eager for work and 
reality again."
<P>
"But aren't these people real?"
<P>
"They're so superficial, so extravagant!"
<P>
I said I was not shocked by their unreality.  They seemed the least 
affected people I had ever met.  "And are they really so 
extravagant?" I asked, and put it to her that her dresses cost quite 
as much as any other woman's in the house.
<P>
"It's not only their dresses," Margaret parried.  "It's the scale 
and spirit of things."
<P>
I questioned that.  "They're cynical," said Margaret, staring before 
her out of the window.
<P>
I challenged her, and she quoted the Brabants, about whom there had 
been an ancient scandal.  She'd heard of it from Altiora, and it was 
also Altiora who'd given her a horror of Lord Carnaby, who was also 
with us.  "You know his reputation," said Margaret.  "That Normandy 
girl.  Every one knows about it.  I shiver when I look at him.  He 
seems--oh! like something not of OUR civilisation.  He WILL come and 
say little things to me."
<P>
"Offensive things?"
<P>
"No, politenesses and things.  Of course his manners are--quite 
right.  That only makes it worse, I think.  It shows he might have 
helped--all that happened.  I do all I can to make him see I don't 
like him.  But none of the others make the slightest objection to 
him."
<P>
"Perhaps these people imagine something might be said for him."
<P>
"That's just it," said Margaret.
<P>
"Charity," I suggested.
<P>
"I don't like that sort of toleration."
<P>
I was oddly annoyed.  "Like eating with publicans and sinners," I 
said.  "No! . . .
<P>
But scandals, and the contempt for rigid standards their condonation 
displayed, weren't more than the sharp edge of the trouble.  "It's 
their whole position, their selfish predominance, their class 
conspiracy against the mass of people," said Margaret.  "When I sit 
at dinner in that splendid room, with its glitter and white 
reflections and candlelight, and its flowers and its wonderful 
service and its candelabra of solid gold, I seem to feel the slums 
and the mines and the over-crowded cottages stuffed away under the 
table."
<P>
I reminded Margaret that she was not altogether innocent of unearned 
increment.
<P>
"But aren't we doing our best to give it back?" she said.
<P>
I was moved to question her.  "Do you really think," I asked, "that 
the Tories and peers and rich people are to blame for social 
injustice as we have it to-day?  Do you really see politics as a 
struggle of light on the Liberal side against darkness on the Tory?"
<P>
"They MUST know," said Margaret.
<P>
I found myself questioning that.  I see now that to Margaret it must 
have seemed the perversest carping against manifest things, but at 
the time I was concentrated simply upon the elucidation of her view 
and my own; I wanted to get at her conception in the sharpest, 
hardest lines that were possible.  It was perfectly clear that she 
saw Toryism as the diabolical element in affairs.  The thing showed 
in its hopeless untruth all the clearer for the fine, clean emotion 
with which she gave it out to me.  My sleeping peer in the library 
at Stamford Court and Evesham talking luminously behind the 
Hartstein flowers embodied the devil, and my replete citizen sucking 
at his cigar in the National Liberal Club, Willie Crampton 
discussing the care and management of the stomach over a specially 
hygienic lemonade, and Dr. Tumpany in his aggressive frock-coat 
pegging out a sort of copyright in Socialism, were the centre and 
wings of the angelic side.  It was nonsense.  But how was I to put 
the truth to her?
<P>
"I don't see things at all as you do," I said.  "I don't see things 
in the same way."
<P>
"Think of the poor," said Margaret, going off at a tangent.
<P>
"Think of every one," I said.  "We Liberals have done more mischief 
through well-intentioned benevolence than all the selfishness in the 
world could have done.  We built up the liquor interest."
<P>
"WE!" cried Margaret.  "How can you say that?  It's against us."
<P>
"Naturally.  But we made it a monopoly in our clumsy efforts to 
prevent people drinking what they liked, because it interfered with 
industrial regularity--"
<P>
"Oh!" cried Margaret, stung; and I could see she thought I was 
talking mere wickedness.
<P>
"That's it," I said.
<P>
"But would you have people drink whatever they pleased?"
<P>
"Certainly.  What right have I to dictate to other men and women?"
<P>
"But think of the children!"
<P>
"Ah! there you have the folly of modern Liberalism, its half-
cunning, half-silly way of getting at everything in a roundabout 
fashion.  If neglecting children is an offence, and it IS an 
offence, then deal with it as such, but don't go badgering and 
restricting people who sell something that may possibly in some 
cases lead to a neglect of children.  If drunkenness is an offence, 
punish it, but don't punish a man for selling honest drink that 
perhaps after all won't make any one drunk at all.  Don't intensify 
the viciousness of the public-house by assuming the place isn't fit 
for women and children.  That's either spite or folly.  Make the 
public-house FIT for women and children.  Make it a real public-
house.  If we Liberals go on as we are going, we shall presently 
want to stop the sale of ink and paper because those things tempt 
men to forgery.  We do already threaten the privacy of the post 
because of betting tout's letters.  The drift of all that kind of 
thing is narrow, unimaginative, mischievous, stupid. . . ."
<P>
I stopped short and walked to the window and surveyed a pretty 
fountain, facsimile of one in Verona, amidst trim-cut borderings of 
yew.  Beyond, and seen between the stems of ilex trees, was a great 
blaze of yellow flowers. . . .
<P>
"But prevention," I heard Margaret behind me, "is the essence of our 
work."
<P>
I turned.  "There's no prevention but education.  There's no 
antiseptics in life but love and fine thinking.  Make people fine, 
make fine people.  Don't be afraid.  These Tory leaders are better 
people individually than the average; why cast them for the villains 
of the piece?  The real villain in the piece--in the whole human 
drama--is the muddle-headedness, and it matters very little if it's 
virtuous-minded or wicked.  I want to get at muddle-headedness.  If 
I could do that I could let all that you call wickedness in the 
world run about and do what it jolly well pleased.  It would matter 
about as much as a slightly neglected dog--in an otherwise well-
managed home."
<P>
My thoughts had run away with me.
<P>
"I can't understand you," said Margaret, in the profoundest 
distress.  "I can't understand how it is you are coming to see 
things like this."
<P>

The moods of a thinking man in politics are curiously evasive and 
difficult to describe.  Neither the public nor the historian will 
permit the statesman moods.  He has from the first to assume he has 
an Aim, a definite Aim, and to pretend to an absolute consistency 
with that.  Those subtle questionings about the very fundamentals of 
life which plague us all so relentlessly nowadays are supposed to be 
silenced.  He lifts his chin and pursues his Aim explicitly in the 
sight of all men.  Those who have no real political experience can 
scarcely imagine the immense mental and moral strain there is 
between one's everyday acts and utterances on the one hand and the 
"thinking-out" process on the other.  It is perplexingly difficult 
to keep in your mind, fixed and firm, a scheme essentially complex, 
to keep balancing a swaying possibility while at the same time under 
jealous, hostile, and stupid observation you tread your part in the 
platitudinous, quarrelsome, ill-presented march of affairs. . . .
<P>
The most impossible of all autobiographies is an intellectual 
autobiography.  I have thrown together in the crudest way the 
elements of the problem I struggled with, but I can give no record 
of the subtle details; I can tell nothing of the long vacillations 
between Protean values, the talks and re-talks, the meditations, the 
bleak lucidities of sleepless nights. . . .
<P>
And yet these things I have struggled with must be thought out, and, 
to begin with, they must be thought out in this muddled, 
experimenting way.  To go into a study to think about statecraft is 
to turn your back on the realities you are constantly needing to 
feel and test and sound if your thinking is to remain vital; to 
choose an aim and pursue it in despite of all subsequent 
questionings is to bury the talent of your mind.  It is no use 
dealing with the intricate as though it were simple, to leap 
haphazard at the first course of action that presents itself; the 
whole world of politicians is far too like a man who snatches a 
poker to a failing watch.  It is easy to say he wants to "get 
something done," but the only sane thing to do for the moment is to 
put aside that poker and take thought and get a better implement. . . .
<P>
One of the results of these fundamental preoccupations of mine was a 
curious irritability towards Margaret that I found difficult to 
conceal.  It was one of the incidental cruelties of our position 
that this should happen.  I was in such doubt myself, that I had no 
power to phrase things for her in a form she could use.  Hitherto I 
had stage-managed our "serious" conversations.  Now I was too much 
in earnest and too uncertain to go on doing this.  I avoided talk 
with her.  Her serene, sustained confidence in vague formulae and 
sentimental aspirations exasperated me; her want of sympathetic 
apprehension made my few efforts to indicate my changing attitudes 
distressing and futile.  It wasn't that I was always thinking right, 
and that she was always saying wrong.  It was that I was struggling 
to get hold of a difficult thing that was, at any rate, half true, I 
could not gauge how true, and that Margaret's habitual phrasing 
ignored these elusive elements of truth, and without premeditation 
fitted into the weaknesses of my new intimations, as though they had 
nothing but weaknesses.  It was, for example, obvious that these big 
people, who were the backbone of Imperialism and Conservatism, were 
temperamentally lax, much more indolent, much more sensuous, than 
our deliberately virtuous Young Liberals.  I didn't want to be 
reminded of that, just when I was in full effort to realise the 
finer elements in their composition.  Margaret classed them and 
disposed of them.  It was our incurable differences in habits and 
gestures of thought coming between us again.
<P>
The desert of misunderstanding widened.  I was forced back upon 
myself and my own secret councils.  For a time I went my way alone; 
an unmixed evil for both of us.  Except for that Pentagram evening, 
a series of talks with Isabel Rivers, who was now becoming more and 
more important in my intellectual life, and the arguments I 
maintained with Crupp, I never really opened my mind at all during 
that period of indecisions, slow abandonments, and slow 
acquisitions.
