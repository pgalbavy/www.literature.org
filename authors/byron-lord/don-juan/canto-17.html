The world is full of orphans: firstly, those<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are so in the strict sense of the phrase<br/>
(But many a lonely tree the loftier grows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than others crowded in the forest's maze);<br/>
The next are such as are not doomed to lose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their tender parents in their budding days,<br/>
But merely their parental tenderness,<br/>
Which leaves them orphans of the heart no less.

</p>
<p>
The next are 'only children', as they are styled,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who grow up children only, since the old saw<br/>
Pronounces that an 'only' 's a spoilt child.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not to go too far, I hold it law<br/>
That where their education, harsh or mild,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Transgresses the great bounds of love or awe,<br/>
The sufferers, be't in heart or intellect,<br/>
Whate'er the cause are orphans in effect.

</p>
<p>
But to return unto the stricter rule<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(As far as words make rules), our common notion<br/>
Of orphans paints at once a parish school,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-starved babe, a wreck upon life's ocean,<br/>
A human (what the Italians nickname) 'mule',<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A theme for pity or some worse emotion;<br/>
Yet, if examined, it might be admitted<br/>
The wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied.

</p>
<p>
Too soon they are parents to themselves; for what<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are tutors, guardians, and so forth, compared<br/>
With Nature's genial genitors, so that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A child of Chancery, that Star Chamber ward<br/>
(I'll take the likeness I can first come at),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is like a duckling by Dame Partlett reared<br/>
And frights, especially if 'tis a daughter,<br/>
The old hen by running headlong to the water.

</p>
<p>
There is a commonplace book argument,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which glibly glides from every vulgar tongue<br/>
When any dare a new light to present:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'If you are right, then everybody's wrong.'<br/>
Suppose the converse of this precedent<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So often urged, so loudly and so long:<br/>
'If you are wrong, then everybody's right.'<br/>
Was ever everybody yet so quite?

</p>
<p>
Therefore I would solicit free discussion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon all points, no matter what or whose,<br/>
Because as ages upon ages push on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is apt the former to accuse<br/>
Of pillowing its head on a pincushion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heedless of pricks because it was obtuse.<br/>
What was a paradox becomes a truth or<br/>
A something like it, as bear witness Luther.

</p>
<p>
The sacraments have been reduced to two<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And witches unto none, though somewhat late<br/>
Since burning aged women (save a few,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not witches, only bitches, who create<br/>
Mischief in families, as some know or knew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should still be singed, but slightly let me state)<br/>
Has been declared an act of inurbanity,<br/>
Malg√©  Sir Matthew Hale's great humanity.

</p>
<p>
Great Galileo was debarred the sun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he fixed it, and to stop his talking<br/>
How earth could round the solar orbit run,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found his own legs embargoed from mere walking.<br/>
The man was well nigh dead, ere men begun<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To think his skull had not some need of caulking,<br/>
But now it seems he's right, his notion just,<br/>
No doubt a consolation to his dust.

</p>
<p>
Pythagoras, Locke, Socrates&mdash;but pages<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might be filled up, as vainly as before,<br/>
With the sad usage of all sorts of sages,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in his lifetime each was deemed a bore.<br/>
The loftiest minds outrun their tardy ages;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This they must bear with and perhaps much more.<br/>
The wise man's sure when he no more can share it, he<br/>
Will have a firm post-obit on posterity.

</p>
<p>
If such doom waits each intellectual giant,<br/>
&nbsp;We little people in our lesser way<br/>
To life's small rubs should surely be more pliant,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so for one will I, as well I may.<br/>
Would that I were less bilious&mdash;but oh fie on't!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as I make my mind up everyday<br/>
To be a totus teres stoic, sage,<br/>
The wind shifts and I fly into a rage.

</p>
<p>
Temperate I am, yet never had a temper;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Modest I am, yet with some slight assurance;<br/>
Changeable too, yet somehow idem semper;<br/>
&nbsp;Patient, but not enamoured of endurance;<br/>
Cheerful, but sometimes rather apt to whimper;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mild, but at times a sort of Hercules furens;<br/>
So that I almost think that the same skin<br/>
For one without has two or three within.

</p>
<p>
Our hero was in canto the sixteenth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Left in a tender moonlight situation,<br/>
Such as enables man to show his strength<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Moral or physical On this occasion<br/>
Whether his virtue triumphed, or at length<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His vice&mdash;for he was of a kindling nation&mdash;<br/>
Is more than I shall venture to describe,<br/>
Unless some beauty with a kiss should bribe.

</p>
<p>
I leave the thing a problem, like all things.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning came, and breakfast, tea and toast,<br/>
Of which most men partake, but no one sings.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The company, whose birth, wealth, worth have cost<br/>
My trembling lyre already several strings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembled with our hostess and mine host.<br/>
&nbsp;The guests dropped in, the last but one, Her Grace,<br/>
The latest, Juan with his virgin face.

</p>
<p>
Which best is to encounter, ghost or none,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twere difficult to say, but Juan looked<br/>
As if he had combated with more than one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being wan and worn, with eyes that hardly brooked<br/>
The light that through the Gothic windows shone.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Grace too had a sort of air rebuked,<br/>
Seemed pale and shivered, as if she had kept<br/>
A vigil or dreamt rather more than slept.
