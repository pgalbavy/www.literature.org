<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Beauvale is, or was, the largest parish in England.  It is thinly
populated, only just netting the stragglers from shoals of houses
in three large mining villages.  For the rest, it holds a great
tract of woodland, fragment of old Sherwood, a few hills of pasture
and arable land, three collieries, and, finally, the ruins of a
Cistercian abbey.  These ruins lie in a still rich meadow at the
foot of the last fall of woodland, through whose oaks shines a blue
of hyacinths, like water, in May-time.  Of the abbey, there remains
only the east wall of the chancel standing, a wild thick mass of
ivy weighting one shoulder, while pigeons perch in the tracery of
the lofty window.  This is the window in question.</p>

<p>The vicar of Beauvale is a bachelor of forty-two years.  Quite
early in life some illness caused a slight paralysis of his right
side, so that he drags a little, and so that the right corner of
his mouth is twisted up into his cheek with a constant grimace,
unhidden by a heavy moustache.  There is something pathetic about
this twist on the vicar's countenance: his eyes are so shrewd and
sad.  It would be hard to get near to Mr Colbran.  Indeed, now, his
soul had some of the twist of his face, so that, when he is not
ironical, he is satiric.  Yet a man of more complete tolerance and
generosity scarcely exists.  Let the boors mock him, he merely
smiles on the other side, and there is no malice in his eyes, only
a quiet expression of waiting till they have finished.  His people
do not like him, yet none could bring forth an accusation against
him, save, that &quot;You never can tell when he's having you.&quot;</p>

<p>I dined the other evening with the vicar in his study.  The room
scandalizes the neighbourhood because of the statuary which adorns
it: a Laocoon and other classic copies, with bronze and silver
Italian Renaissance work.  For the rest, it is all dark and tawny.</p>

<p>Mr Colbran is an archaeologist.  He does not take himself
seriously, however, in his hobby, so that nobody knows the worth of
his opinions on the subject.</p>

<p>&quot;Here you are,&quot; he said to me after dinner, &quot;I've found another
paragraph for my great work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Haven't I told you I was compiling a Bible of the English people - 
the Bible of their hearts - their exclamations in presence of the
unknown?  I've found a fragment at home, a jump at God from
Beauvale.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where?&quot; I asked, startled.</p>

<p>The vicar closed his eyes whilst looking at me.</p>

<p>&quot;Only on parchment,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Then, slowly, he reached for a yellow book, and read, translating
as he went:</p>

<p>&quot;Then, while we chanted, came a crackling at the window, at the
great east window, where hung our Lord on the Cross.  It was a
malicious covetous Devil wrathed by us, rended the lovely image of
the glass.  We saw the iron clutches of the fiend pick the window,
and a face flaming red like fire in a basket did glower down on us.
Our hearts melted away, our legs broke, we thought to die.  The
breath of the wretch filled the chapel.</p>

<p>&quot;But our dear Saint, etc., etc., came hastening down heaven to
defend us.  The fiend began to groan and bray - he was daunted and
beat off.</p>

<p>&quot;When the sun uprose, and it was morning, some went out in dread
upon the thin snow.  There the figure of our Saint was broken and
thrown down, whilst in the window was a wicked hole as from the
Holy Wounds the Blessed Blood was run out at the touch of the
Fiend, and on the snow was the Blood, sparkling like gold.  Some
gathered it up for the joy of this House. . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Interesting,&quot; I said.  &quot;Where's it from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Beauvale records - fifteenth century.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Beauvale Abbey,&quot; I said; &quot;they were only very few, the monks.
What frightened them, I wonder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder,&quot; he repeated.</p>

<p>&quot;Somebody climbed up,&quot; I supposed, &quot;and attempted to get in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; he exclaimed, smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what do you think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pretty much the same,&quot; he replied.  &quot;I glossed it out for my
book.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your great work?  Tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>He put a shade over the lamp so that the room was almost in
darkness.</p>

<p>&quot;Am I more than a voice?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I can see your hand,&quot; I replied.  He moved entirely from the
circle of light.  Then his voice began, sing-song, sardonic:</p>

<p>&quot;I was a serf in Rollestoun's Newthorpe Manor, master of the
stables I was.  One day a horse bit me as I was grooming him.  He
was an old enemy of mine.  I fetched him a blow across the nose.
Then, when he got a chance, he lashed out at me and caught me a
gash over the mouth.  I snatched at a hatchet and cut his head.  He
yelled, fiend as he was, and strained for me with all his teeth
bare.  I brought him down.</p>

<p>&quot;For killing him they flogged me till they thought I was dead.  I
was sturdy, because we horse-serfs got plenty to eat.  I was
sturdy, but they flogged me till I did not move.  The next night I
set fire to the stables, and the stables set fire to the house.  I
watched and saw the red flame rise and look out of the window, I
saw the folk running, each for himself, master no more than one of
a frightened party.  It was freezing, but the heat made me sweat.
I saw them all turn again to watch, all rimmed with red.  They
cried, all of them when the roof went in, when the sparks splashed
up at rebound.  They cried then like dogs at the bagpipes howling.
Master cursed me, till I laughed as I lay under a bush quite near.</p>

<p>&quot;As the fire went down I got frightened.  I ran for the woods, with
fire blazing in my eyes and crackling in my ears.  For hours I was
all fire.  Then I went to sleep under the bracken.  When I woke it
was evening.  I had no mantle, was frozen stiff.  I was afraid to
move, lest all the sores of my back should be broken like thin ice.
I lay still until I could bear my hunger no longer.  I moved then
to get used to the pain of movement, when I began to hunt for food.
There was nothing to be found but hips.</p>

<p>&quot;After wandering about till I was faint I dropped again in the
bracken.  The boughs above me creaked with frost.  I started and
looked round.  The branches were like hair among the starlight.  My
heart stood still.  Again there was a creak, creak, and suddenly a
whoop, that whistled in fading.  I fell down in the bracken like
dead wood.  Yet, by the peculiar whistling sound at the end, I knew
it was only the ice bending or tightening in the frost.  I was in
the woods above the lake, only two miles from the Manor.  And yet,
when the lake whooped hollowly again, I clutched the frozen soil,
every one of my muscles as stiff as the stiff earth.  So all the
night long I dare not move my face, but pressed it flat down, and
taut I lay as if pegged down and braced.</p>

<p>&quot;When morning came still I did not move, I lay still in a dream.
By afternoon my ache was such it enlivened me.  I cried, rocking my
breath in the ache of moving.  Then again I became fierce.  I beat
my hands on the rough bark to hurt them, so that I should not ache
so much.  In such a rage I was I swung my limbs to torture till I
fell sick with pain.  Yet I fought the hurt, fought it and fought
by twisting and flinging myself, until it was overcome.  Then the
evening began to draw on.  All day the sun had not loosened the
frost.  I felt the sky chill again towards afternoon.  Then I knew
the night was coming, and, remembering the great space I had just
come through, horrible so that it seemed to have made me another
man, I fled across the wood.</p>

<p>&quot;But in my running I came upon the oak where hanged five bodies.
There they must hang, bar-stiff, night after night.  It was a
terror worse than any.  Turning, blundering through the forest, I
came out where the trees thinned, where only hawthorns, ragged and
shaggy, went down to the lake's edge.</p>

<p>&quot;The sky across was red, the ice on the water glistened as if it
were warm.  A few wild geese sat out like stones on the sheet of
ice.  I thought of Martha.  She was the daughter of the miller at
the upper end of the lake.  Her hair was red like beech leaves in a
wind.  When I had gone often to the mill with the horses she had
brought me food.</p>

<p>&quot;'I thought,' said I to her, ''twas a squirrel sat on your
shoulder.  'Tis your hair fallen loose.'</p>

<p>&quot;'They call me the fox,' she said.</p>

<p>&quot;'Would I were your dog,' said I.  She would bring me bacon and
good bread, when I called at the mill with the horses.  The thought
of cakes of bread and of bacon made me reel as if drunk.  I had
torn at the rabbit holes, I had chewed wood all day.  In such a
dimness was my head that I felt neither the soreness of my wounds
nor the cuts of thorns on my knees, but stumbled towards the mill,
almost past fear of man and death, panting with fear of the
darkness that crept behind me from trunk to trunk.</p>

<p>&quot;Coming to the gap in the wood, below which lay the pond, I heard
no sound.  Always I knew the place filled with the buzz of water,
but now it was silent.  In fear of this stillness I ran forward,
forgetting myself, forgetting the frost.  The wood seemed to pursue
me.  I fell, just in time, down by a shed wherein were housed the
few wintry pigs.  The miller came riding in on his horse, and the
barking of dogs was for him.  I heard him curse the day, curse his
servant, curse me, whom he had been out to hunt, in his rage of
wasted labour, curse all.  As I lay I heard inside the shed a
sucking.  Then I knew that the sow was there, and that the most of
her sucking pigs would be already killed for tomorrow's Christmas.
The miller, from forethought to have young at that time, made
profit by his sucking pigs that were sold for the mid-winter feast.</p>

<p>&quot;When in a moment all was silent in the dusk, I broke the bar and
came into the shed.  The sow grunted, but did not come forth to
discover me.  By and by I crept in towards her warmth.  She had but
three young left, which now angered her, she being too full of
milk.  Every now and again she slashed at them and they squealed.
Busy as she was with them, I in the darkness advanced towards her.
I trembled so that scarce dared I trust myself near her, for long
dared not put my naked face towards her.  Shuddering with hunger
and fear, I at last fed of her, guarding my face with my arm.  Her
own full young tumbled squealing against me, but she, feeling her
ease, lay grunting.  At last I, too, lay drunk, swooning.</p>

<p>&quot;I was roused by the shouting of the miller.  He, angered by his
daughter who wept, abused her, driving her from the house to feed
the swine.  She came, bowing under a yoke, to the door of the shed.
Finding the pin broken she stood afraid, then, as the sow grunted,
she came cautiously in.  I took her with my arm, my hand over her
mouth.  As she struggled against my breast my heart began to beat
loudly.  At last she knew it was I.  I clasped her.  She hung in my
arms, turning away her face, so that I kissed her throat.  The
tears blinded my eyes, I know not why, unless it were the hurt of
my mouth, wounded by the horse, was keen.</p>

<p>&quot;'They will kill you,' she whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;'No,' I answered.</p>

<p>&quot;And she wept softly.  She took my head in her arms and kissed me,
wetting me with her tears, brushing me with her keen hair, warming
me through.</p>

<p>&quot;'I will not go away from here,' I said.  'Bring me a knife, and I
will defend myself.'</p>

<p>&quot;'No,' she wept.  'Ah, no!'</p>

<p>&quot;When she went I lay down, pressing my chest where she had rested
on the earth, lest being alone were worse emptiness than hunger.</p>

<p>&quot;Later she came again.  I saw her bend in the doorway, a lanthorn
hanging in front.  As she peered under the redness of her falling
hair, I was afraid of her.  But she came with food.  We sat
together in the dull light.  Sometimes still I shivered and my
throat would not swallow.</p>

<p>&quot;'If,' said I, 'I eat all this you have brought me, I shall sleep
till somebody finds me.'</p>

<p>&quot;Then she took away the rest of the meat.</p>

<p>&quot;'Why,' said I, 'should I not eat?'  She looked at me in tears of
fear.</p>

<p>&quot;'What?' I said, but still she had no answer.  I kissed her, and
the hurt of my wounded mouth angered me.</p>

<p>&quot;'Now there is my blood,' said I, 'on your mouth.'  Wiping her
smooth hand over her lips, she looked thereat, then at me.</p>

<p>&quot;'Leave me,' I said, 'I am tired.'  She rose to leave me.</p>

<p>&quot;'But bring a knife,' I said.  Then she held the lanthorn near my
face, looking as at a picture.</p>

<p>&quot;'You look to me,' she said, 'like a stirk that is roped for the
axe.  Your eyes are dark, but they are wide open.'</p>

<p>&quot;'Then I will sleep,' said I, 'but will not wake too late.'</p>

<p>&quot;'Do not stay here,' she said.</p>

<p>&quot;'I will not sleep in the wood,' I answered, and it was my heart
that spoke, 'for I am afraid.  I had better be afraid of the voice
of man and dogs, than the sounds in the woods.  Bring me a knife,
and in the morning I will go.  Alone will I not go now.'</p>

<p>&quot;'The searchers will take you,' she said.</p>

<p>&quot;'Bring me a knife,' I answered.</p>

<p>&quot;'Ah, go,' she wept.</p>

<p>&quot;'Not now - I will not - '</p>

<p>&quot;With that she lifted the lanthorn, lit up her own face and mine.
Her blue eyes dried of tears.  Then I took her to myself, knowing
she was mine.</p>

<p>&quot;'I will come again,' she said.</p>

<p>&quot;She went, and I folded my arms, lay down and slept.</p>

<p>&quot;When I woke, she was rocking me wildly to rouse me.</p>

<p>&quot;'I dreamed,' said I, 'that a great heap, as if it were a hill, lay
on me and above me.'</p>

<p>&quot;She put a cloak over me, gave me a hunting-knife and a wallet of
food, and other things I did not note.  Then under her own cloak
she hid the lanthorn.</p>

<p>&quot;'Let us go,' she said, and blindly I followed her.</p>

<p>&quot;When I came out into the cold someone touched my face and my hair.</p>

<p>&quot;'Ha!' I cried, 'who now - ?'  Then she swiftly clung to me, hushed
me.</p>

<p>&quot;'Someone has touched me,' I said aloud, still dazed with sleep.</p>

<p>&quot;'Oh hush!' she wept.  ''Tis snowing.'  The dogs within the house
began to bark.  She fled forward, I after her.  Coming to the ford
of the stream she ran swiftly over, but I broke through the ice.
Then I knew where I was.  Snowflakes, fine and rapid, were biting
at my face.  In the wood there was no wind nor snow.</p>

<p>&quot;'Listen,' said I to her, 'listen, for I am locked up with sleep.'</p>

<p>&quot;'I hear roaring overhead,' she answered.  'I hear in the trees
like great bats squeaking.'</p>

<p>&quot;'Give me your hand,' said I.</p>

<p>&quot;We heard many noises as we passed.  Once as there uprose a
whiteness before us, she cried aloud.</p>

<p>&quot;'Nay,' said I, 'do not untie thy hand from mine,' and soon we were
crossing fallen snow.  But ever and again she started back from
fear.</p>

<p>&quot;'When you draw back my arm,' I said, angry, 'you loosed a weal on
my shoulder.'</p>

<p>&quot;Thereafter she ran by my side, like a fawn beside its mother.</p>

<p>&quot;'We will cross the valley and gain the stream,' I said.  'That
will lead us on its ice as on a path deep into the forest.  There
we can join the outlaws.  The wolves are driven from this part.
They have followed the driven deer.'</p>

<p>&quot;We came directly on a large gleam that shaped itself up among
flying grains of snow.</p>

<p>&quot;'Ah!' she cried, and she stood amazed.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I thought we had gone through the bounds into faery realm,
and I was no more a man.  How did I know what eyes were gleaming at
me between the snow, what cunning spirits in the draughts of air?
So I waited for what would happen, and I forgot her, that she was
there.  Only I could feel the spirits whirling and blowing about
me.</p>

<p>&quot;Whereupon she clung upon me, kissing me lavishly, and, were dogs
or men or demons come upon us at that moment, she had let us be
stricken down, nor heeded not.  So we moved forward to the shadow
that shone in colours upon the passing snow.  We found ourselves
under a door of light which shed its colours mixed with snow.  This
Martha had never seen, nor I, this door open for a red and brave
issuing like fires.  We wondered.</p>

<p>&quot;'It is faery,' she said, and after a while, 'Could one catch such - 
Ah, no!'</p>

<p>&quot;Through the snow shone bunches of red and blue.</p>

<p>&quot;'Could one have such a little light like a red flower - only a
little, like a rose-berry scarlet on one's breast! - then one were
singled out as Our Lady.'</p>

<p>&quot;I flung off my cloak and my burden to climb up the face of the
shadow.  Standing on rims of stone, then in pockets of snow, I
reached upward.  My hand was red and blue, but I could not take the
stuff.  Like colour of a moth's wing it was on my hand, it flew on
the increasing snow.  I stood higher on the head of a frozen man,
reached higher my hand.  Then I felt the bright stuff cold.  I
could not pluck it off.  Down below she cried to me to come again
to her.  I felt a rib that yielded, I struck at it with my knife.
There came a gap in the redness.  Looking through I saw below as it
were white stunted angels, with sad faces lifted in fear.  Two
faces they had each, and round rings of hair.  I was afraid.  I
grasped the shining red, I pulled.  Then the cold man under me
sank, so I fell as if broken on to the snow.</p>

<p>&quot;Soon I was risen again, and we were running downwards towards the
stream.  We felt ourselves eased when the smooth road of ice was
beneath us.  For a while it was resting, to travel thus evenly.
But the wind blew round us, the snow hung upon us, we leaned us
this way and that, towards the storm.  I drew her along, for she
came as a bird that stems lifting and swaying against the wind.  By
and by the snow came smaller, there was not wind in the wood.  Then
I felt nor labour, nor cold.  Only I knew the darkness drifted by
on either side, that overhead was a lane of paleness where a moon
fled us before.  Still, I can feel the moon fleeing from me, can
feel the trees passing round me in slow dizzy reel, can feel the
hurt of my shoulder and my straight arm torn with holding her.  I
was following the moon and the stream, for I knew where the water
peeped from its burrow in the ground there were shelters of the
outlaw.  But she fell, without sound or sign.</p>

<p>&quot;I gathered her up and climbed the bank.  There all round me hissed
the larchwood, dry beneath, and laced with its dry-fretted cords.
For a little way I carried her into the trees.  Then I laid her
down till I cut flat hairy boughs.  I put her in my bosom on this
dry bed, so we swooned together through the night.  I laced her
round and covered her with myself, so she lay like a nut within its
shell.</p>

<p>&quot;Again, when morning came, it was pain of cold that woke me.  I
groaned, but my heart was warm as I saw the heap of red hair in my
arms.  As I looked at her, her eyes opened into mine.  She smiled - 
from out of her smile came fear.  As if in a trap she pressed back
her head.</p>

<p>&quot;'We have no flint,' said I.</p>

<p>&quot;'Yes - in the wallet, flint and steel and tinder box,' she
answered.</p>

<p>&quot;'God yield you blessing,' I said.</p>

<p>&quot;In a place a little open I kindled a fire of larch boughs.  She
was afraid of me, hovering near, yet never crossing a space.</p>

<p>&quot;'Come,' said I, 'let us eat this food.'</p>

<p>&quot;'Your face,' she said, 'is smeared with blood.'</p>

<p>&quot;I opened out my cloak.</p>

<p>&quot;'But come,' said I, 'you are frosted with cold.'</p>

<p>&quot;I took a handful of snow in my hand, wiping my face with it, which
then I dried on my cloak.</p>

<p>&quot;'My face is no longer painted with blood, you are no longer afraid
of me.  Come here then, sit by me while we eat.'</p>

<p>&quot;But as I cut the cold bread for her, she clasped me suddenly,
kissing me.  She fell before me, clasped my knees to her breast,
weeping.  She laid her face down to my feet, so that her hair
spread like a fire before me.  I wondered at the woman.  'Nay,' I
cried.  At that she lifted her face to me from below.  'Nay,' I
cried, feeling my tears fall.  With her head on my breast, my own
tears rose from their source, wetting my cheek and her hair, which
was wet with the rain of my eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I remembered and took from my bosom the coloured light of
that night before.  I saw it was black and rough.</p>

<p>&quot;'Ah,' said I, 'this is magic.'</p>

<p>&quot;'The black stone!' she wondered.</p>

<p>&quot;'It is the red light of the night before,' I said.</p>

<p>&quot;'It is magic,' she answered.</p>

<p>&quot;'Shall I throw it?' said I, lifting the stone, 'shall I throw it
away, for fear?'</p>

<p>&quot;'It shines!' she cried, looking up.  'It shines like the eye of a
creature at night, the eye of a wolf in the doorway.'</p>

<p>&quot;''Tis magic,' I said, 'let me throw it from us.'  But nay, she
held my arm.</p>

<p>&quot;'It is red and shining,' she cried.</p>

<p>&quot;'It is a bloodstone,' I answered.  'It will hurt us, we shall die
in blood.'</p>

<p>&quot;'But give it to me,' she answered.</p>

<p>&quot;'It is red of blood,' I said.</p>

<p>&quot;'Ah, give it to me,' she called.</p>

<p>&quot;'It is my blood,' I said.</p>

<p>&quot;'Give it,' she commanded, low.</p>

<p>&quot;'It is my life-stone,' I said.</p>

<p>&quot;'Give it me,' she pleaded.</p>

<p>&quot;'I gave it her.  She held it up, she smiled, she smiled in my
face, lifting her arms to me.  I took her with my mouth, her mouth,
her white throat.  Nor she ever shrank, but trembled with
happiness.</p>

<p>&quot;What woke us, when the woods were filling again with shadow, when
the fire was out, when we opened our eyes and looked up as if
drowned, into the light which stood bright and thick on the tree-
tops, what woke us was the sound of wolves. . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nay,&quot; said the vicar, suddenly rising, &quot;they lived happily ever
after.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I said.</p>
