<p>The dualism of mind and matter, if we have been right so far,
cannot be allowed as metaphysically valid. Nevertheless, we seem
to find a certain dualism, perhaps not ultimate, within the world
as we observe it. The dualism is not primarily as to the stuff
of the world, but as to causal laws. On this subject we may again
quote William James. He points out that when, as we say, we merely
"imagine" things, there are no such effects as would ensue if
the things were what we call "real." He takes the case of imagining
a fire.</p>

<p>"I make for myself an experience of blazing fire; I place it
near my body; but it does not warm me in the least. I lay a stick
upon it and the stick either burns or remains green, as I please.
I call up water, and pour it on the fire, and absolutely no difference
ensues. I account for all such facts by calling this whole train
of experiences unreal, a mental train. Mental fire is what won't
burn real sticks; mental water is what won't necessarily (though
of course it may) put out even a mental fire.... With 'real' objects,
on the contrary, consequences always accrue; and thus the real
experiences get sifted from the mental ones, the things from our
thoughts of them, fanciful or true, and precipitated together
as the stable part of the whole experience&mdash;chaos, under the name
of the physical world."*</p>

<p>In this passage James speaks, by mere inadvertence, as though
the phenomena which he is describing as "mental" had NO effects.
This is, of course, not the case: they have their effects, just
as much as physical phenomena do, but their effects follow different
laws. For example, dreams, as Freud has shown, are just as much
subject to laws as are the motions of the planets. But the laws
are different: in a dream you may be transported from one place
to another in a moment, or one person may turn into another under
your eyes. Such differences compel you to distinguish the world
of dreams from the physical world.</p>

<p>If the two sorts of causal laws could be sharply distinguished,
we could call an occurrence "physical" when it obeys causal laws
appropriate to the physical world, and "mental" when it obeys
causal laws appropriate to the mental world. Since the mental
world and the physical world interact, there would be a boundary
between the two: there would be events which would have physical
causes and mental effects, while there would be others which would
have mental causes and physical effects. Those that have physical
causes and mental effects we should define as "sensations." Those
that have mental causes and physical effects might perhaps be
identified with what we call voluntary movements; but they do
not concern us at present.</p>

<p>These definitions would have all the precision that could be
desired if the distinction between physical and psychological
causation were clear and sharp. As a matter of fact, however,
this distinction is, as yet, by no means sharp. It is possible
that, with fuller knowledge, it will be found to be no more ultimate
than the distinction between the laws of gases and the laws of
rigid bodies. It also suffers from the fact that an event may
be an effect of several causes according to several causal laws
we cannot, in general, point to anything unique as <em>THE </em>cause
of such-and-such an event. And finally it is by no means certain
that the peculiar causal laws which govern mental events are not
really physiological. The law of habit, which is one of the most
distinctive, may be fully explicable in terms of the peculiarities
of nervous tissue, and these peculiarities, in turn, may be explicable
by the laws of physics. It seems, therefore, that we are driven
to a different kind of definition. It is for this reason that
it was necessary to develop the definition of perception. With
this definition, we can define a sensation as the non-mnemic elements
in a perception.</p>

<p>When, following our definition, we try to decide what elements
in our experience are of the nature of sensations, we find more
difficulty than might have been expected. Prima facie, everything
is sensation that comes to us through the senses: the sights we
see, the sounds we hear, the smells we smell, and so on; also
such things as headache or the feeling of muscular strain. But
in actual fact so much interpretation, so much of habitual correlation,
is mixed with all such experiences, that the core of pure sensation
is only to be extracted by careful investigation. To take a simple
illustration: if you go to the theatre in your own country, you
seem to hear equally well in the stalls or the dress circle; in
either case you think you miss nothing. But if you go in a foreign
country where you have a fair knowledge of the language, you will
seem to have grown partially deaf, and you will find it necessary
to be much nearer the stage than you would need to be in your
own country. The reason is that, in hearing our own language spoken,
we quickly and unconsciously fill out what we really hear with
inferences to what the man must be saying, and we never realize
that we have not heard the words we have merely inferred. In a
foreign language, these inferences are more difficult, and we
are more dependent upon actual sensation. If we found ourselves
in a foreign world, where tables looked like cushions and cushions
like tables, we should similarly discover how much of what we
think we see is really inference. Every fairly familiar sensation
is to us a sign of the things that usually go with it, and many
of these things will seem to form part of the sensation. I remember
in the early days of motor-cars being with a friend when a tyre
burst with a loud report. He thought it was a pistol, and supported
his opinion by maintaining that he had seen the flash. But of
course there had been no flash. Nowadays no one sees a flash when
a tyre bursts.</p>

<p>In order, therefore, to arrive at what really is sensation in
an occurrence which, at first sight, seems to contain nothing
else, we have to pare away all that is due to habit or expectation
or interpretation. This is a matter for the psychologist, and
by no means an easy matter. For our purposes, it is not important
to determine what exactly is the sensational core in any case;
it is only important to notice that there certainly is a sensational
core, since habit, expectation and interpretation are diversely
aroused on diverse occasions, and the diversity is clearly due
to differences in what is presented to the senses. When you open
your newspaper in the morning, the actual sensations of seeing
the print form a very minute part of what goes on in you, but
they are the starting-point of all the rest, and it is through
them that the newspaper is a means of information or mis-information.
Thus, although it may be difficult to determine what exactly is
sensation in any given experience, it is clear that there is sensation,
unless, like Leibniz, we deny all action of the outer world upon
us.</p>

<p>Sensations are obviously the source of our knowledge of the world,
including our own body. It might seem natural to regard a sensation
as itself a cognition, and until lately I did so regard it. When,
say, I see a person I know coming towards me in the street, it
<em>SEEMS </em>as though the mere seeing were knowledge. It is
of course undeniable that knowledge comes <em>THROUGH </em>the
seeing, but I think it is a mistake to regard the mere seeing
itself as knowledge. If we are so to regard it, we must distinguish
the seeing from what is seen: we must say that, when we see a
patch of colour of a certain shape, the patch of colour is one
thing and our seeing of it is another. This view, however, demands
the admission of the subject, or act, in the sense discussed in
our first lecture. If there is a subject, it can have a relation
to the patch of colour, namely, the sort of relation which we
might call awareness. In that case the sensation, as a mental
event, will consist of awareness of the colour, while the colour
itself will remain wholly physical, and may be called the sense-datum,
to distinguish it from the sensation. The subject, however, appears
to be a logical fiction, like mathematical points and instants.
It is introduced, not because observation reveals it, but because
it is linguistically convenient and apparently demanded by grammar.
Nominal entities of this sort may or may not exist, but there
is no good ground for assuming that they do. The functions that
they appear to perform can always be performed by classes or series
or other logical constructions, consisting of less dubious entities.
If we are to avoid a perfectly gratuitous assumption, we must
dispense with the subject as one of the actual ingredients of
the world. But when we do this, the possibility of distinguishing
the sensation from the sense-datum vanishes; at least I see no
way of preserving the distinction. Accordingly the sensation that
we have when we see a patch of colour simply is that patch of
colour, an actual constituent of the physical world, and part
of what physics is concerned with. A patch of colour is certainly
not knowledge, and therefore we cannot say that pure sensation
is cognitive. Through its psychological effects, it is the cause
of cognitions, partly by being itself a sign of things that are
correlated with it, as e.g. sensations of sight and touch are
correlated, and partly by giving rise to images and memories after
the sensation is faded. But in itself the pure sensation is not
cognitive.</p>

<p>In the first lecture we considered the view of Brentano, that
"we may define psychical phenomena by saying that they are phenomena
which intentionally contain an object." We saw reasons to reject
this view in general; we are now concerned to show that it must
be rejected in the particular case of sensations. The kind of
argument which formerly made me accept Brentano's view in this
case was exceedingly simple. When I see a patch of colour, it
seemed to me that the colour is not psychical, but physical, while
my seeing is not physical, but psychical. Hence I concluded that
the colour is something other than my seeing of the colour. This
argument, to me historically, was directed against idealism: the
emphatic part of it was the assertion that the colour is physical,
not psychical. I shall not trouble you now with the grounds for
holding as against Berkeley that the patch of colour is physical;
I have set them forth before, and I see no reason to modify them.
But it does not follow that the patch of colour is not also psychical,
unless we assume that the physical and the psychical cannot overlap,
which I no longer consider a valid assumption. If we admit&mdash;as
I think we should&mdash;that the patch of colour may be both physical
and psychical, the reason for distinguishing the sense-datum from
the sensation disappears, and we may say that the patch of colour
and our sensation in seeing it are identical.</p>

<p>This is the view of William James, Professor Dewey, and the American
realists. Perceptions, says Professor Dewey, are not per se cases
of knowledge, but simply natural events with no more knowledge
status than (say) a shower. "Let them [the realists] try the experiment
of conceiving perceptions as pure natural events, not cases of
awareness or apprehension, and they will be surprised to see how
little they miss."* I think he is right in this, except in supposing
that the realists will be surprised. Many of them already hold
the view he is advocating, and others are very sympathetic to
it. At any rate, it is the view which I shall adopt in these lectures.</p>

<p>The stuff of the world, so far as we have experience of it, consists,
on the view that I am advocating, of innumerable transient particulars
such as occur in seeing, hearing, etc., together with images more
or less resembling these, of which I shall speak shortly. If physics
is true, there are, besides the particulars that we experience,
others, probably equally (or almost equally) transient, which
make up that part of the material world that does not come into
the sort of contact with a living body that is required to turn
it into a sensation. But this topic belongs to the philosophy
of physics, and need not concern us in our present inquiry.</p>

<p>Sensations are what is common to the mental and physical worlds;
they may be defined as the intersection of mind and matter. This
is by no means a new view; it is advocated, not only by the American
authors I have mentioned, but by Mach in his Analysis of Sensations,
which was published in 1886. The essence of sensation, according
to the view I am advocating, is its independence of past experience.
It is a core in our actual experiences, never existing in isolation
except possibly in very young infants. It is not itself knowledge,
but it supplies the data for our knowledge of the physical world,
including our own bodies.</p>

<p>There are some who believe that our mental life is built up out
of sensations alone. This may be true; but in any case I think
the only ingredients required in addition to sensations are images.
What images are, and how they are to be defined, we have now to
inquire.</p>

<p>The distinction between images and sensations might seem at first
sight by no means difficult. When we shut our eyes and call up
pictures of familiar scenes, we usually have no difficulty, so
long as we remain awake, in discriminating between what we are
imagining and what is really seen. If we imagine some piece of
music that we know, we can go through it in our mind from beginning
to end without any discoverable tendency to suppose that we are
really hearing it. But although such cases are so clear that no
confusion seems possible, there are many others that are far more
difficult, and the definition of images is by no means an easy
problem.</p>

<p>To begin with: we do not always know whether what we are experiencing
is a sensation or an image. The things we see in dreams when our
eyes are shut must count as images, yet while we are dreaming
they seem like sensations. Hallucinations often begin as persistent
images, and only gradually acquire that influence over belief
that makes the patient regard them as sensations. When we are
listening for a faint sound&mdash;the striking of a distant clock,
or a horse's hoofs on the road&mdash;we think we hear it many times
before we really do, because expectation brings us the image,
and we mistake it for sensation. The distinction between images
and sensations is, therefore, by no means always obvious to inspection.*</p>

Semon, "Die mnemischen Empfindungen," pp. 19-20.

</p>
</div>
<p>We may consider three different ways in which it has been sought
to distinguish images from sensations, namely:</p>

<p>(1) By the less degree of vividness in images;</p>

<p>(2) By our absence of belief in their "physical reality";</p>

<p>(3) By the fact that their causes and effects are different from
those of sensations.</p>

<p>I believe the third of these to be the only universally applicable
criterion. The other two are applicable in very many cases, but
cannot be used for purposes of definition because they are liable
to exceptions. Nevertheless, they both deserve to be carefully
considered.</p>

<p>(1) Hume, who gives the names "impressions" and "ideas" to what
may, for present purposes, be identified with our "sensations"
and "images," speaks of impressions as "those perceptions which
enter with most force and violence" while he defines ideas as
"the faint images of these (i.e. of impressions) in thinking and
reasoning." His immediately following observations, however, show
the inadequacy of his criteria of "force" and "faintness." He
says:</p>

<p>"I believe it will not be very necessary to employ many words
in explaining this distinction. Every one of himself will readily
perceive the difference betwixt feeling and thinking. The common
degrees of these are easily distinguished, though it is not impossible
but in particular instances they may very nearly approach to each
other. Thus in sleep, in a fever, in madness, or in any very violent
emotions of soul, our ideas may approach to our impressions; as,
on the other hand, it sometimes happens, that our impressions
are so faint and low that we cannot distinguish them from our
ideas. But notwithstanding this near resemblance in a few instances,
they are in general so very different, that no one can make a
scruple to rank them under distinct heads, and assign to each
a peculiar name to mark the difference" ("Treatise of Human Nature,"
Part I, Section I).</p>

<p>I think Hume is right in holding that they should be ranked under
distinct heads, with a peculiar name for each. But by his own
confession in the above passage, his criterion for distinguishing
them is not always adequate. A definition is not sound if it only
applies in cases where the difference is glaring: the essential
purpose of a definition is to provide a mark which is applicable
even in marginal cases&mdash;except, of course, when we are dealing
with a conception, like, e.g. baldness, which is one of degree
and has no sharp boundaries. But so far we have seen no reason
to think that the difference between sensations and images is
only one of degree.</p>

<p>Professor Stout, in his "Manual of Psychology," after discussing
various ways of distinguishing sensations and images, arrives
at a view which is a modification of Hume's. He says (I quote
from the second edition):</p>

<p>"Our conclusion is that at bottom the distinction between image
and percept, as respectively faint and vivid states, is based
on a difference of quality. The percept has an aggressiveness
which does not belong to the image. It strikes the mind with varying
degrees of force or liveliness according to the varying intensity
of the stimulus. This degree of force or liveliness is part of
what we ordinarily mean by the intensity of a sensation. But this
constituent of the intensity of sensations is absent in mental
imagery"(p. 419).</p>

<p>This view allows for the fact that sensations may reach any degree
of faintness&mdash;e.g. in the case of a just visible star or a just
audible sound&mdash;without becoming images, and that therefore mere
faintness cannot be the characteristic mark of images. After explaining
the sudden shock of a flash of lightning or a steam-whistle, Stout
says that "no mere image ever does strike the mind in this manner"(p.
417). But I believe that this criterion fails in very much the
same instances as those in which Hume's criterion fails in its
original form. Macbeth speaks of&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
that suggestion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make my seated heart knock at my ribs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the use of nature.

</p>
</div>
<p>The whistle of a steam-engine could hardly have a stronger effect
than this. A very intense emotion will often bring with it&mdash;especially
where some future action or some undecided issue is involved&mdash;powerful
compelling images which may determine the whole course of life,
sweeping aside all contrary solicitations to the will by their
capacity for exclusively possessing the mind. And in all cases
where images, originally recognized as such, gradually pass into
hallucinations, there must be just that "force or liveliness"
which is supposed to be always absent from images. The cases of
dreams and fever-delirium are as hard to adjust to Professor Stout's
modified criterion as to Hume's. I conclude therefore that the
test of liveliness, however applicable in ordinary instances,
cannot be used to define the differences between sensations and
images.</p>

<p>(2) We might attempt to distinguish images from sensations by
our absence of belief in the "physical reality" of images. When
we are aware that what we are experiencing is an image, we do
not give it the kind of belief that we should give to a sensation:
we do not think that it has the same power of producing knowledge
of the "external world." Images are "imaginary"; in <em>SOME </em>sense
they are "unreal." But this difference is hard to analyse or state
correctly. What we call the "unreality" of images requires interpretation
it cannot mean what would be expressed by saying "there's no such
thing." Images are just as truly part of the actual world as sensations
are. All that we really mean by calling an image "unreal" is that
it does not have the concomitants which it would have if it were
a sensation. When we call up a visual image of a chair, we do
not attempt to sit in it, because we know that, like Macbeth's
dagger, it is not "sensible to feeling as to sight"&mdash;i.e. it does
not have the correlations with tactile sensations which it would
have if it were a visual sensation and not merely a visual image.
But this means that the so-called "unreality" of images consists
merely in their not obeying the laws of physics, and thus brings
us back to the causal distinction between images and sensations.</p>

<p>This view is confirmed by the fact that we only feel images to
be "unreal" when we already know them to be images. Images cannot
be defined by the <em>FEELING </em>of unreality, because when
we falsely believe an image to be a sensation, as in the case
of dreams, it <em>FEELS </em>just as real as if it were a sensation.
Our feeling of unreality results from our having already realized
that we are dealing with an image, and cannot therefore be the
definition of what we mean by an image. As soon as an image begins
to deceive us as to its status, it also deceives us as to its
correlations, which are what we mean by its "reality."</p>

<p>(3) This brings us to the third mode of distinguishing images
from sensations, namely, by their causes and effects. I believe
this to be the only valid ground of distinction. James, in the
passage about the mental fire which won't burn real sticks, distinguishes
images by their effects, but I think the more reliable distinction
is by their causes. Professor Stout (loc. cit., p. 127) says:
"One characteristic mark of what we agree in calling sensation
is its mode of production. It is caused by what we call a <em>STIMULUS.
A </em>stimulus is always some condition external to the nervous
system itself and operating upon it." I think that this is the
correct view, and that the distinction between images and sensations
can only be made by taking account of their causation. Sensations
come through sense-organs, while images do not. We cannot have
visual sensations in the dark, or with our eyes shut, but we can
very well have visual images under these circumstances. Accordingly
images have been defined as "centrally excited sensations," i.e.
sensations which have their physiological cause in the brain only,
not also in the sense-organs and the nerves that run from the
sense-organs to the brain. I think the phrase "centrally excited
sensations" assumes more than is necessary, since it takes it
for granted that an image must have a proximate physiological
cause. This is probably true, but it is an hypothesis, and for
our purposes an unnecessary one. It would seem to fit better with
what we can immediately observe if we were to say that an image
is occasioned, through association, by a sensation or another
image, in other words that it has a mnemic cause&mdash;which does not
prevent it from also having a physical cause. And I think it will
be found that the causation of an image always proceeds according
to mnemic laws, i.e. that it is governed by habit and past experience.
If you listen to a man playing the pianola without looking at
him, you will have images of his hands on the keys as if he were
playing the piano; if you suddenly look at him while you are absorbed
in the music, you will experience a shock of surprise when you
notice that his hands are not touching the notes. Your image of
his hands is due to the many times that you have heard similar
sounds and at the same time seen the player's hands on the piano.
When habit and past experience play this part, we are in the region
of mnemic as opposed to ordinary physical causation. And I think
that, if we could regard as ultimately valid the difference between
physical and mnemic causation, we could distinguish images from
sensations as having mnemic causes, though they may also have
physical causes. Sensations, on the other hand, will only have
physical causes.</p>

<p>However this may be, the practically effective distinction between
sensations and images is that in the causation of sensations,
but not of images, the stimulation of nerves carrying an effect
into the brain, usually from the surface of the body, plays an
essential part. And this accounts for the fact that images and
sensations cannot always be distinguished by their intrinsic nature.</p>

<p>Images also differ from sensations as regards their effects.
Sensations, as a rule, have both physical and mental effects.
As you watch the train you meant to catch leaving the station,
there are both the successive positions of the train (physical
effects) and the successive waves of fury and disappointment (mental
effects). Images, on the contrary, though they <em>MAY </em>produce
bodily movements, do so according to mnemic laws, not according
to the laws of physics. All their effects, of whatever nature,
follow mnemic laws. But this difference is less suitable for definition
than the difference as to causes.</p>

<p>Professor Watson, as a logical carrying-out of his behaviourist
theory, denies altogether that there are any observable phenomena
such as images are supposed to be. He replaces them all by faint
sensations, and especially by pronunciation of words sotto voce.
When we "think" of a table (say), as opposed to seeing it, what
happens, according to him, is usually that we are making small
movements of the throat and tongue such as would lead to our uttering
the word "table" if they were more pronounced. I shall consider
his view again in connection with words; for the present I am
only concerned to combat his denial of images. This denial is
set forth both in his book on "Behavior" and in an article called
"Image and Affection in Behavior" in the "Journal of Philosophy,
Psychology and Scientific Methods," vol. x (July, 1913). It seems
to me that in this matter he has been betrayed into denying plain
facts in the interests of a theory, namely, the supposed impossibility
of introspection. I dealt with the theory in Lecture VI; for the
present I wish to reinforce the view that the facts are undeniable.</p>

<p>Images are of various sorts, according to the nature of the sensations
which they copy. Images of bodily movements, such as we have when
we imagine moving an arm or, on a smaller scale, pronouncing a
word, might possibly be explained away on Professor Watson's lines,
as really consisting in small incipient movements such as, if
magnified and prolonged, would be the movements we are said to
be imagining. Whether this is the case or not might even be decided
experimentally. If there were a delicate instrument for recording
small movements in the mouth and throat, we might place such an
instrument in a person's mouth and then tell him to recite a poem
to himself, as far as possible only in imagination. I should not
be at all surprised if it were found that actual small movements
take place while he is "mentally" saying over the verses. The
point is important, because what is called "thought" consists
mainly (though I think not wholly) of inner speech. If Professor
Watson is right as regards inner speech, this whole region is
transferred from imagination to sensation. But since the question
is capable of experimental decision, it would be gratuitous rashness
to offer an opinion while that decision is lacking.</p>

<p>But visual and auditory images are much more difficult to deal
with in this way, because they lack the connection with physical
events in the outer world which belongs to visual and auditory
sensations. Suppose, for example, that I am sitting in my room,
in which there is an empty arm-chair. I shut my eyes, and call
up a visual image of a friend sitting in the arm-chair. If I thrust
my image into the world of physics, it contradicts all the usual
physical laws. My friend reached the chair without coming in at
the door in the usual way; subsequent inquiry will show that he
was somewhere else at the moment. If regarded as a sensation,
my image has all the marks of the supernatural. My image, therefore,
is regarded as an event in me, not as having that position in
the orderly happenings of the public world that belongs to sensations.
By saying that it is an event in me, we leave it possible that
it may be <em>PHYSIOLOGICALLY </em>caused: its privacy may be
only due to its connection with my body. But in any case it is
not a public event, like an actual person walking in at the door
and sitting down in my chair. And it cannot, like inner speech,
be regarded as a <em>SMALL </em>sensation, since it occupies just
as large an area in my visual field as the actual sensation would
do.</p>

<p>Professor Watson says: "I should throw out imagery altogether
and attempt to show that all natural thought goes on in terms
of sensori-motor processes in the larynx." This view seems to
me flatly to contradict experience. If you try to persuade any
uneducated person that she cannot call up a visual picture of
a friend sitting in a chair, but can only use words describing
what such an occurrence would be like, she will conclude that
you are mad. (This statement is based upon experiment.) Galton,
as every one knows, investigated visual imagery, and found that
education tends to kill it: the Fellows of the Royal Society turned
out to have much less of it than their wives. I see no reason
to doubt his conclusion that the habit of abstract pursuits makes
learned men much inferior to the average in power of visualizing,
and much more exclusively occupied with words in their "thinking."
And Professor Watson is a very learned man.</p>

<p>I shall henceforth assume that the existence of images is admitted,
and that they are to be distinguished from sensations by their
causes, as well as, in a lesser degree, by their effects. In their
intrinsic nature, though they often differ from sensations by
being more dim or vague or faint, yet they do not always or universally
differ from sensations in any way that can be used for defining
them. Their privacy need form no bar to the scientific study of
them, any more than the privacy of bodily sensations does. Bodily
sensations are admitted by even the most severe critics of introspection,
although, like images, they can only be observed by one observer.
It must be admitted, however, that the laws of the appearance
and disappearance of images are little known and difficult to
discover, because we are not assisted, as in the case of sensations,
by our knowledge of the physical world.</p>

<p>There remains one very important point concerning images, which
will occupy us much hereafter, and that is, their resemblance
to previous sensations. They are said to be "copies" of sensations,
always as regards the simple qualities that enter into them, though
not always as regards the manner in which these are put together.
It is generally believed that we cannot imagine a shade of colour
that we have never seen, or a sound that we have never heard.
On this subject Hume is the classic. He says, in the definitions
already quoted:</p>

<p>"Those perceptions, which enter with most force and violence,
we may name <em>IMPRESSIONS; </em>and under this name I comprehend
all our sensations, passions and emotions, as they make their
first appearance in the soul. By <em>IDEAS I </em>mean the faint
images of these in thinking and reasoning."</p>

<p>He next explains the difference between simple and complex ideas,
and explains that a complex idea may occur without any similar
complex impression. But as regards simple ideas, he states that
"every simple idea has a simple impression, which resembles it,
and every simple impression a correspondent idea." He goes on
to enunciate the general principle "that all our simple ideas
in their first appearance are derived from simple impressions,
which are correspondent to them, and which they exactly represent"
("Treatise of Human Nature," Part I, Section I).</p>

<p>It is this fact, that images resemble antecedent sensations,
which enables us to call them images "of" this or that. For the
understanding of memory, and of knowledge generally, the recognizable
resemblance of images and sensations is of fundamental importance.</p>

<p>There are difficulties in establishing Hume's principles, and
doubts as to whether it is exactly true. Indeed, he himself signalized
an exception immediately after stating his maxim. Nevertheless,
it is impossible to doubt that in the main simple images are copies
of similar simple sensations which have occurred earlier, and
that the same is true of complex images in all cases of memory
as opposed to mere imagination. Our power of acting with reference
to what is sensibly absent is largely due to this characteristic
of images, although, as education advances, images tend to be
more and more replaced by words. We shall have much to say in
the next two lectures on the subject of images as copies of sensations.
What has been said now is merely by way of reminder that this
is their most notable characteristic.</p>

<p>I am by no means confident that the distinction between images
and sensations is ultimately valid, and I should be glad to be
convinced that images can be reduced to sensations of a peculiar
kind. I think it is clear, however, that, at any rate in the case
of auditory and visual images, they do differ from ordinary auditory
and visual sensations, and therefore form a recognizable class
of occurrences, even if it should prove that they can be regarded
as a sub-class of sensations. This is all that is necessary to
validate the use of images to be made in the sequel.</p>
