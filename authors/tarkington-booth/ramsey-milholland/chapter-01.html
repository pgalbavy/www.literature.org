When Johnnie comes marching home again,<br/>
Hurrah!  Hurrah!<br/>
We'll give him a hearty welcome then,<br/>
Hurrah!  Hurrah!<br/>
The men with the cheers, the boys with shouts,<br/>
The ladies they will all turn out,<br/>
And we'll all feel gay, when Johnnie comes marching home again!

<p>The old man and the little boy, his grandson, sat together in
the shade of the big walnut tree in the front yard, watching the
"Decoration Day Parade," as it passed up the long street; and
when the last of the veterans was out of sight the grandfather
murmured the words of the tune that came drifting back from the
now distant band at the head of the procession.</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll all feel gay when Johnnie comes marching home again,"
he finished, with a musing chuckle.</p>

<p>"Did you, Grandpa?" the boy asked.</p>

<p>"Did I what?"</p>

<p>"Did you all feel gay when the army got home?"</p>

<p>"It didn't get home all at once, precisely," the grandfather
explained. "When the war was over I suppose we felt relieved,
more than anything else."</p>

<p>"You didn't feel so gay when the war <em>was</em>, though, I
guess!" the boy ventured.</p>

<p>"I guess we didn't."</p>

<p>"Were you scared, Grandpa? Were you ever scared the Rebels would
win?"</p>

<p>"No. We weren't ever afraid of that."</p>

<p>"Not any at all?"</p>

<p>"No. Not any at all."</p>

<p>"Well, weren't you ever scared yourself, Grandpa? I mean when
you were in a battle."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; <em>then</em> I was." The old man laughed. "Scared
plenty!"</p>

<p>"I don't see why," the boy said promptly. "I wouldn't be scared
in a battle."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"'Course not! Grandpa, why don't you march in the Decoration
Day Parade? Wouldn't they let you?"</p>

<p>"I'm not able to march any more. Too short of breath and too
shaky in the legs and too blind."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care," said the boy. "I'd be in the parade anyway,
if I was you. They had some sittin' in carriages, 'way at the
tail end; but I wouldn't like that. If I'd been in your place,
Grandpa, and they'd let me be in that parade, I'd been right up
by the band. Look, Grandpa! Watch me, Grandpa! This is the way
I'd be, Grandpa."</p>

<p>He rose from the garden bench where they sat, and gave a complex
imitation of what had most appealed to him as the grandeurs of
the procession, his prancing legs simulating those of the horse
of the grand marshal, while his upper parts rendered the drums
and bugles of the band, as well as the officers and privates of
the militia company which had been a feature of the parade. The
only thing he left out was the detachment of veterans.</p>

<p>"Putty-boom! Putty-boom! Putty-boom-boom-boom!" he vociferated,
as the drums&mdash;and then as the bugles: "Ta, ta, ra, tara!" He addressed
his restive legs: "<em>Whoa</em>, there, you Whitey! Gee! Haw!
Git up!" Then, waving an imaginary sword: "Col-lumn right! Farwud
<em>March!</em> Halt! Carry <em>harms!</em>" He "carried arms."
"Show-dler <em>harms!</em>" He "shouldered arms,"  and returned
to his seat.</p>

<p>"That'd be me, Grandpa. That's the way I'd do." And as the grandfather
nodded, seeming to agree, a thought recently dismissed returned
to the mind of the composite procession and he asked:</p>

<p>"Well, <em>why</em> weren't you ever afraid the Rebels would
whip the Unions, Grandpa?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we knew they couldn't."</p>

<p>"I guess so." The little boy laughed disdainfully, thinking his
question satisfactorily answered. "I guess those ole Rebels couldn't
whipped a flea! They didn't know how to fight any at all, did
they, Grandpa?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they did!"</p>

<p>"What?" The boy was astounded. "Weren't they all just reg'lar
ole cowards, Grandpa?"</p>

<p>"No," said the grandfather. "They were pretty fine soldiers."</p>

<p>"They were? Well, they ran away whenever you began shootin' at
'em, didn't they?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes they did, but most times they didn't. Sometimes they
fought like wildcats&mdash;and sometimes we were the ones that ran
away."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To keep from getting killed, or maybe to keep from getting captured."</p>

<p>"But the Rebels were bad men, weren't they, Grandpa?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The boy's forehead, customarily vacant, showed some little vertical
shadows, produced by a struggle to think. "Well, but&mdash;" he began,
slowly. "Listen, Grandpa, listen here!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Listen! Well, you said&mdash;you said you never got scared the ole
Rebels were goin' to win."</p>

<p>"They did win pretty often," said the grandfather. "They won
a good many battles."</p>

<p>"I mean, you said you never got scared they'd win the war."</p>

<p>"No, we were never afraid of that."</p>

<p>"Well, but if they were good men and fought like wildcats, Grandpa,
and kep' winning battles and everything, how could that be? How
could you <em>help</em> bein' scared they'd win the war?"</p>

<p>The grandfather's feeble eyes twinkled brightly. "Why, we <em>knew</em>
they couldn't, Ramsey."</p>

<p>At this, the little vertical shadows on Ramsey's forehead became
more pronounced, for he had succeeded in thinking. "Well, <em>they</em>
didn't know they couldn't, did they?" he argued. "They thought
they were goin' to win, didn't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess they did. Up till toward the last, I suppose they
probably did. But you see they were wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;" Ramsey struggled. "Listen! Listen here, Grandpa!
Well, anyway, if they never got scared <em>we'd</em> win, and
nobody got scared <em>they'd</em> win&mdash;well, I don't see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't see what?"</p>

<p>But Ramsey found himself unable to continue his concentration;
he slumped down upon the small of his back, and his brow relaxed
to its more comfortable placidity, while his eyes wandered with
a new butterfly fluttering over the irises that bordered the iron
picket fence at the south side of the yard. "Oh, nothin' much,"
he murmured.</p>

<p>"I see." And his grandfather laughed again. "You mean: If the
Rebels felt just as sure of winning the war as we did, and kept
winning battles why shouldn't we ever have had any doubts that
we were going to win? That's it, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I guess so, Grandpa."</p>

<p>"Well, I think it was mostly because we were certain that we
were right."</p>

<p>"I see," said Ramsey. "The Rebels knew they were on the side
of the Devil." But at this, the grandfather's laugh was louder
than it had been before, and Ramsey looked hurt. "Well, you can
laugh if you want to!" he objected in an aggrieved voice. "Anyway,
the Sunday-school sup'intendent told us when people knew they
were on the Devil's side they always&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I dare say, I dare say," the old man interrupted, a little impatiently.
"But in this world mighty few people think they're on the Devil's
side, Ramsey. There was a Frenchman once, in olden times; he said
people were crazy because, though they couldn't even make worms,
they believed they could make gods. And so whenever countries
or parts of a country get into a war, each side makes a god and
a devil, and says: 'God's on our side and the Devil's on the other.'
The South thought the Devil was on our side, you see."</p>

<p>"Well, that kind o' mixes it all up more'n ever."</p>

<p>"Yes, it seems so; but Abraham Lincoln wasn't mixed up about
it. When some people told him that God was on our side, he said
the important thing was to find out if we were on God's side.
That was the whole question, you see; because either side could
make up a god, the kind of a god they liked and wanted; and then
they'd believe in him, too, and fight for him&mdash;but if he was only
a made-up god they'd lose. President Lincoln didn't want to have
a made-up god on his side; he wanted to find God Himself and find
out what he wanted, and then do it. And that's what Lincoln did."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't understand much of all <em>that</em>!"</p>

<p>"No? Then suppose you look at it this way: The South was fighting
for what it believed to be its rights, but we weren't fighting
for our rights; we were fighting for the right. The South was
fighting for what it believed to be its right to split the Union
and be a country by itself; but we were fighting for 'Liberty
and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.' It wasn't only
the Union we fought for; it was Freedom. The South wanted freedom
to leave the Union; but the reason the South wanted that freedom
to separate from us was because <em>we</em> wanted the Freedom
of Man. <em>There's</em> the reason we had the certain knowledge
that we were going to win the war. How plain and simple it is!"</p>

<p>Ramsey didn't think so. He had begun to feel bored by the conversation,
and to undergo the oppression he usually suffered in school; yet
he took a little interest in the inexplicable increase of fervour
with which his grandfather spoke, and in a shoot of sunshine which
somehow got through the foliage of the walnut tree and made a
bedazzlement of glinting fine lines in one spot, about the size
of a saucer, upon the old man's head of thick white hair. Half
closing his eyes, drowsily, Ramsey played that this sunshine spot
was a white bird's-nest and, and he had a momentary half dream
of a glittering little bird that dwelt there and wore a blue soldier
cap on its head. The earnest old voice of the veteran was only
a sound in the boy's ears.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's simple and plain enough now, though then we didn't
often think of it in exactly this way, but just went on fighting
and never doubted. We knew the struggle and suffering of our fathers
and grandfathers to make a great country here for Freedom, and
we knew that all this wasn't just the whim of a foolish god, willing
to waste such great things&mdash;we knew that such a country couldn't
have been building up just to be wasted. But, more than that,
we knew that armies fighting for the Freedom of Man <em>had</em>
to win, in the long run, over armies that fought for what they
considered their rights.</p>

<p>"We didn't set out to free the slaves, so far as we knew. Yet
our being against slavery was what made the war, and we had the
consciousness that we were on the side of God's plan, because
His plan is clearly the Freedom of Man. Long ago we began to see
the hints of His plan&mdash;a little like the way you can see what's
coming in August from what happens in April, but man has to win
his freedom from himself&mdash;men in the light have to fight against
men in the dark of their own shadow. That light is the answer;
we had the light that made us never doubt. Ours was the true light,
and so we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Boom&mdash;" The veterans had begun to fire their cannon on the crest
of the low hill, out at the cemetery; and from a little way down
the street came the rat-a-tat of a toy drum and sounds of a fife
played execrably. A file of children in cocked hats made of newspapers
came marching importantly up the sidewalk under the maple shade
trees; and in advance, upon a velocipede, rode a tin-sworded personage,
shrieking incessant commands but not concerning himself with whether
or not any military obedience was thereby obtained. Here was a
revivifying effect upon young Ramsey; his sluggard eyelids opened
electrically; he leaped to his feet and, abandoning his grandfather
without preface or apology, sped across the lawn and out of the
gate, charging headlong upon the commander of the company.</p>

<p>"You get off that 'locipede, Wesley Bender!" he bellowed. "You
gimme that sword! What rights you got to go bein' captain o' my
army, I'd like to know! Who got up this army, in the first place,
I'd like to know! I did, myself yesterd'y afternoon, and you get
back in line or I won't let you b'long to it at all!"</p>

<p>The pretender succumbed; he instantly dismounted, being out-shouted
and overawed. On foot he took his place in the ranks, while Ramsey
became sternly vociferous. "In-tention, company! Farwud <em>march</em>!
Col-lumn <em>right</em>! Right-showdler <em>harms</em>! Halt!
Far-wud <em>march</em>. Carry harms&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Army went trudging away under the continuous but unheeded
fire of orders, and presently disappeared round a corner, leaving
the veteran chuckling feebly under his walnut tree and alone with
the empty street. All trace of what he had said seemed to have
been wiped from the grandson's mind; but memory has curious ways.
Ramsey had understood not a fifth nor a tenth of his grandfather's
talk, and already he had "forgotten" all of it&mdash;yet not only were
there many, many times in the boy's later life when, without ascertainable
cause, he would remember the sunlight falling upon the old man's
white head, to make that semblance of a glittering bird's-nest
there, but with the picture came recollections of words and sentences
spoken by the grandfather, though the listener, half-drowsily,
had heard but the sound of an old, earnest voice&mdash;and even the
veteran's meaning finally took on a greater definiteness till
it became, in the grandson's thoughts, something clear and bright
and beautiful that he knew without being just sure where or how
he had learned it.</p>
