<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Mickey proposed to act upon his own suggestion, which was to
go to sleep as soon as the day ended and discuss the many different
plans during his slumbers. He had a strong hope that the right
one could be hit upon by this method. Somehow or other, his thoughts
were fixed upon the stream, where it disappeared under the rocks,
and, leaving Fred by the camp-fire, he relit his torch and went
off to make another survey.</p>

<p>The lad watched the star-like point of light flickering in the
gloom as his friend moved along, holding the torch over his head.
It seemed to the watcher that when it paused they were separated
by nearly a half mile. The light had an odd way of vanishing and
remaining invisible for several minutes that made him think that
some accident had befallen the bearer, or that the light had gone
out altogether; but after a time it would reappear, dancing about
in a way to show that the bearer was not idle in his researches.</p>

<p>Mickey O'Rooney was indeed active. After making his way to the
point he was seeking, he shied off to the right, and approached
the chasm, down which Fred had lost his rifle. As he stood on
the edge of the rent in the fathomless darkness, he loosened a
boulder with his foot, and as it toppled over, listened for the
result. The way was so narrow that it bounded like a ball from
side to side, and the Irishman heard it as it went lower and lower,
until at last the strained ear could detect nothing more. There
was no sound that came to him to show that it had reached the
bottom.</p>

<p>"I s'pose it's going yet," reflected Mickey, after listening
several minutes, "and no doubt it will kaap on till it comes out
somewhere in Chiny, which I've been told is on t'other side of
the world. Now, why could n't we do the same?" he asked himself,
with a sharp turn of the voice. "If that stone is on its way to
Chiny, why can't we folly on after it? If we can't reach the crust
of the world at this point, what's to hinder our going round by
Chiny?&mdash;that's what I'd like to know. I wonder how long it would
take us? I s'pose we'd get up pretty good steam, and go faster
and faster, so that we wouldn't be many days on the road.</p>

<p>"But there's one great objection," he added, scratching his head
and knitting his brow with thought. "There's nothing to stop us
from bouncing from side to side like that stone. If the way is
rough, we'd be pretty sartin to get our breeches pretty well ripped
off us, and by the time we raiched Chiny, we wouldn't be in a
condition to be presented in coort; and then, too, I haven't enough
money about me to pay my way home again."</p>

<p>The visionary scheme was one of those which grew less in favor
the more he reflected upon it, and, after turning it over for
some minutes longer, he was naturally compelled to abandon the
idea.</p>

<p>"I must try the stream agin," he said, as he rose to his feet
and groped his way back. "That seems to be the best door, after
all, though it ain't the kind I hanker after."</p>

<p>He thrust one end of the torch in the ground some distance away,
and walked to the bank close to the great rock beneath which the
stream dove and disappeared. Stooping down, he observed the same
dull, white appearance that had caught his eye in the first place.
Beyond question this was caused by the sunlight striking the water
from the outside.</p>

<p>"I could almost swear that a feller wouldn't have to go more
than twenty feet before he'd strike daylight," mused Mickey, as
he folded his arms and looked thoughtfully at the misty relief
of the surrounding darkness; "and it would n't take much more
to persuade me to make the dive and try it."</p>

<p>As Mickey stood there, contemplating as best he could the darkly
flowing stream, and debating the matter with himself, he was on
the very eve of making the attempt fully half a dozen times. It
seemed to him that he could not fail, and yet there was something
in the project which held him back.</p>

<p>The stream at that point flowed quite rapidly, and the strongest
swimmer, after venturing a few feet under water, would be utterly
unable to return. Once started, there would be no turning back,
so he concluded not to make the decisive trial just yet.</p>

<p>"The day is pretty nearly ended, and I will drame over it. I
told me laddy that that was my favorite way of getting out of
such a scrape, and I'll thry it. If there's no plan that presints
itself by to-morrow, then I'll thry it then or the day after."</p>

<p>Going to where his torch was still burning in the sand, he drew
it out and moved back toward his old camp-fire.</p>

<p>"Well, me laddy, how have you made out during me absince? Have
you&#11834;"</p>

<p>He paused and looked about him.</p>

<p>"Begorrah, but no laddy is here. Can it be that he has strayed
off, and started to Chiny so as to head me off? I say! Fred, me
laddy, have ye&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Sh! sh!"</p>

<p>And as the hurried aspirate was uttered, the boy came running
silently out of the darkness, with his hand raised in a warning
way.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Mickey, in amazement; "have ye found another
dead man?"</p>

<p>"No; he's a live one!"</p>

<p>"What do yez mane? Explain yerself."</p>

<p>The lad pointed to the opening over their heads, and motioned
to his friend not to draw too near the camp-fire. There was danger
in doing so.</p>

<p>"There's somebody up there," he added, "and they're looking for
us."</p>

<p>"Are ye sure of that?" asked the Irishman, not a little excited
at the news. "It may be that Soot Simpson has found us. Begorrah,
if there is n't any mistake about it, as me uncle remarked, when
he heard that the ship with his wife on was lost at saa, then
I'll execute the Donnybrook jig in the highest style of the art.
What was it that aroused your suspicion that some jintleman was
onmannerly enough to be paaping down on us?"</p>

<p>"I was sitting here watching you, or rather your torch, and all
the time the gravel kept rattling down faster and faster, till
I knowed there was something more than usual going on up there,
and I sneaked away from the fire, where I could get a better look.
I went right under the place, and was about to see something worth
seeing, when some dirt dropped plump into my eye, and I couldn't
see anything for a while. After I had rubbed the grit out I took
another look, and I know I saw something moving up there."</p>

<p>"What did it look like?" asked Mickey, who was moving cautiously
around, with his gaze fixed upon the same opening.</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell, though I tried hard to get a glimpse. It seemed
to me that some one had a stick in his hand, and was beating around
the edges of the opening, as though he wanted to knock the loose
dirt off. I could see the stick flirted about, and fancied I could
see the hand that was holding it, though I could n't be certain
of that."</p>

<p>"No; that's a leetle too much, as me mither obsarved, when me
brother Tim said that he and meself had got along a whole half
day without fighting, and then she whaled us both for lying. Ye
couldn't tell a man's hand at that distance, but I see nothing
of him, and I should like ye to tell me where he's gone."</p>

<p>"That is what puzzles me. Maybe he is afraid that we will see
him."</p>

<p>Mickey was hardly disposed to accept such an explanation. It
seemed to him more likely that it was some wild animal mousing
around the orifice, and displacing the dirt with his paws, although
he couldn't understand why an animal should be attracted by such
a spot.</p>

<p>"It may be one of the spalpeens that got us into all this trouble," 
he added, still circling slowly about, with his eyes fixed upon
the opening. "Those Apaches are sharp-eyed, and perhaps one of
their warriors has struck our trail, and tracked us to that spot.
If it's the same, then I does n't see what he is to gain by fooling
round up there. If he'd be kind 'nough to let a lasso down that
we could climb up by, there'd be some sinse in the same, but&#11834;"</p>

<p>To the horror of both, at that instant there was a flash at the
opening over their heads, a dull report, and the bullet buried
itself in the very centre of the camp-fire.</p>

<p>"Begorrah, but that's what I call cheek, as Ned McGowan used
to say when the folks axed him to pay his debts. While we are
looking about, and axing ourselves whether there's anybody else
at all around us, one of the spalpeens sinds his bullet down here,
coming closer to us than is plaisant. Did ye obsarve him?"</p>

<p>"I saw nothing but the flash. Do you think they could see us?"</p>

<p>"Not where we are now. We're too far away from the light. They've
seen the fire, and by that token they've concluded that we must
be somewhere near it."</p>

<p>"But there was but one shot. Why not more?"</p>

<p>"We'll get the rest of thern arter awhile. That's a sort of faaler,
thrown out to see how we take it, as Larry O'Looligan used to
say when he knocked a man down. Now, do ye stand aside, and I'll
answer 'em."</p>

<p>"You'd better not," protested Fred. "They can tell where we are
by the flash of our guns."</p>

<p>"Whisht, now, can't we move? Kape back in the dark like."</p>

<p>The lad moved away several steps, and Mickey, who made sure that
his form was not revealed by the light of his own camp-fire, circled
around to the other side of the opening, which he was watching
with the keenest interest. His purpose was to catch a glimpse
of the wretch who had fired the shot. But that seemed about impossible.
He could detect something moving now and then, and once or twice
there was a twinkle of something red, like the eagle feather in
the hair of the warrior, but he could make out nothing definitely.</p>

<p>"He's there; and all I want to do is to be certain of hitting
him," he muttered, as he held the cocked rifle to his shoulder.
"I'm afeard that if I miss he'll take such good care of himself
that I won't get another chance&#11834;"</p>

<p>"There, Mickey, there's something," broke in Fred, who was scrutinizing
the opening as closely as he could. "Fire, quick! or you won't
get the chance!"</p>

<p>The words were scarcely uttered, when the Irishman, who had already
taken aim, pulled the trigger, instantly lowering his piece to
watch the result.</p>

<p>Both he and Fred fancied they heard an exclamation, but they
could not be certain. There was no perceptible commotion about
the skylight, but the flickering, erratic movement which had puzzled
them ceased on the instant. Whether the shot had accomplished
anything or not could only be conjectured, but Mickey was of the
opinion that the exchange was equally without result in both cases.</p>
