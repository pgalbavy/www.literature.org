<p>At every possible opportunity William hailed other girls with
a hasty "M'av the next 'thyou?" but he was indeed unfortunate
to have arrived so late.</p>

<p>The best he got was a promise of "the nineteenth&mdash;if there IS
any!"</p>

<p>After each dance Miss Boke conducted him back to the maple-tree,
aloof from the general throng, and William found the intermissions
almost equal to his martyrdoms upon the platform. But, as there
was a barely perceptible balance in their favor, he collected
some fragments of his broken spirit, when Miss Boke would have
borne him to the platform for the sixth time, and begged to "sit
this one out," alleging that he had "kind of turned his ankle,
or something," he believed.</p>

<p>The cordial girl at once placed him upon the chair and gallantly
procured another for herself. In her solicitude she sat close
to him, looking fondly at his face, while William, though now
and then rubbing his ankle for plausibility's sake, gazed at the
platform with an expression which Gustave Dore would gratefully
have found suggestive. William was conscious of a voice continually
in action near him, but not of what it said. Miss Boke was telling
him of the dancing "up at the lake" where she had spent the summer,
and how much she had loved it, but William missed all that. Upon
the many-colored platform the ineffable One drifted to and fro,
back and forth; her little blonde head, in a golden net, glinting
here and there like a bit of tinsel blowing across a flower-garden.</p>

<p>And when that dance and its encore were over she went to lean
against a tree, while Wallace Banks fanned her, but she was so
busy with Wallace that she did not notice William, though she
passed near enough to waft a breath of violet scent to his wan
nose. A fragment of her silver speech tinkled in his ear:</p>

<p>"Oh, Wallie Banks! Bid pid s'ant have Bruvva Josie-Joe's dance
'less Joe say so. Lola <em>MUS' </em>be fair. Wallie mustn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's that Miss Pratt," observed Miss Boke, following William's
gaze with some interest. "You met her yet?"</p>

<p>"Yeh," said William.</p>

<p>"She's been visiting here all summer," Miss Boke informed him.
"I was at a little tea this afternoon, and some of the girls said
this Miss Pratt said she'd never <em>DREAM </em>of getting engaged
to any man that didn't have seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I don't know if it's true or not, but I expect so. Anyway, they
said they heard her say so."</p>

<p>William lifted his right hand from his ankle and passed it, time
after time, across his damp forehead. He did not believe that
Miss Pratt could have expressed herself in so mercenary a manner,
but if she <em>HAD&mdash;</em>well, one fact in British history had
so impressed him that he remembered it even after Examination:
William Pitt, the younger, had been Prime Minister of England
at twenty-one.</p>

<p>If an Englishman could do a thing like that, surely a bright,
energetic young American needn't feel worried about seven hundred
and fifty thousand dollars! And although William, at seventeen,
had seldom possessed more than seven hundred and fifty cents,
four long years must pass, and much could be done, before he would
reach the age at which William Pitt attained the premiership&mdash;coincidentally
a good, ripe, marriageable age. Still, seven hundred and fifty
thousand dollars is a stiffish order, even allowing four long
years to fill it; and undoubtedly Miss Boke's bit of gossip added
somewhat to the already sufficient anxieties of William's evening.</p>

<p>"Up at the lake," Miss Boke chattered on, "we got to use the
hotel dining-room for the hops. It's a floor a good deal like
this floor is to-night&mdash;just about oily enough and as nice a floor
as ever I danced on. We have awf'ly good times up at the lake.
'Course there aren't so many Men up there, like there are here
to-night, and I <em>MUST </em>say I AM glad to get a chance to
dance with a Man again! I told you you'd dance all right, once
we got started, and look at the way it's turned out: our steps
just suit exactly! If I must say it, I could scarcely think of
anybody I <em>EVER </em>met I'd rather dance with. When anybody's
step suits in with mine, that way, why, I <em>LOVE </em>to dance
straight through an evening with one person, the way we're doing."</p>

<p>Dimly, yet with strong repulsion, William perceived that their
interminable companionship had begun to affect Miss Boke with
a liking for him. And as she chattered chummily on, revealing
this increasing cordiality all the while&mdash;though her more obvious
topics were dancing, dancing-floors, and "the lake"&mdash;the reciprocal
sentiment roused in his breast was that of Sindbad the Sailor
for the Old Man of the Sea.</p>

<p>He was unable to foresee a future apart from her; and when she
informed him that she preferred his style of dancing to all other
styles shown by the Men at this party, her thus singling him out
for praise only emphasized, in his mind, that point upon which
he was the most embittered.</p>

<p>"Yes!" he reflected. "It had to be ME!" With all the crowd to
choose from, Mrs. Parcher had to go and pick on <em>HIM! </em>All,
all the others went about, free as air, flitting from girl to
girl&mdash;girls that danced like girls! All, all except William, danced
with Miss <em>PRATT! </em>What Miss Pratt had offered <em>HIM
</em>was a choice between the thirty-second dance and the twenty-first
extra. <em>THAT </em>was what he had to look forward to: the thirty-second
reg'lar or the twenty-first extra!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, merely through eternity, he was sealed unto Miss Boke.</p>

<p>The tie that bound them oppressed him as if it had been an ill-omened
matrimony, and he sat beside her like an unwilling old husband.
All the while, Miss Boke had no appreciation whatever of her companion's
real condition, and, when little, spasmodic, sinister changes
appeared in his face (as they certainly did from time to time)
she attributed them to pains in his ankle. However, William decided
to discard his ankle, after they had "sat out" two dances on account
of it. He decided that he preferred dancing, and said he guessed
he must be better.</p>

<p>So they danced again&mdash;and again.</p>

<p>When the fourteenth dance came, about half an hour before midnight,
they were still dancing together.</p>

<p>It was upon the conclusion of this fourteenth dance that Mr.
Parcher mentioned to his wife a change in his feelings toward
William. "I've been watching him," said Mr. Parcher, "and I never
saw true misery show plainer. He's having a really horrible time.
By George! I hate him, but I've begun to feel kind of sorry for
him! Can't you trot up somebody else, so he can get away from
that fat girl?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Parcher shook her head in a discouraged way. "I've tried,
and I've tried, and I've tried!" she said.</p>

<p>"Well, try again."</p>

<p>"I can't now." She waved her hand toward the rear of the house.
Round the corner marched a short procession of negroes, bearing
trays; and the dancers were dispersing themselves to chairs upon
the lawn "for refreshments."</p>

<p>"Well, do something," Mr. Parcher urged. "We don't want to find
him in the cistern in the morning!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Parcher looked thoughtful, then brightened. "<em>I</em>
know!" she said. "I'll make May and Lola and their partners come
sit in this little circle of chairs here, and then I'll go and
bring Willie and Miss Boke to sit with them. I'll give Willie
the seat at Lola's left. You keep the chairs."</p>

<p>Straightway she sped upon her kindly errand. It proved successful,
so successful, indeed, that without the slightest effort&mdash;without
even a hint on her part&mdash;she brought not only William and his
constant friend to sit in the circle with Miss Pratt, Miss Parcher
and their escorts, but Mr. Bullitt, Mr. Watson, Mr. Banks, and
three other young gentlemen as well. Nevertheless, Mrs. Parcher
managed to carry out her plan, and after a little display of firmness,
saw William satisfactorily established in the chair at Miss Pratt's
left.</p>

<p>At last, at last, he sat beside the fairy-like creature, and
filled his lungs with infinitesimal particles of violet scent.
More: he was no sooner seated than the little blonde head bent
close to his; the golden net brushed his cheek. She whispered:</p>

<p>"No'ty ickle boy Batster! Lola's last night, an' ickle boy Batster
fluttin'! Flut all night wif dray bid dirl!"</p>

<p>William made no reply.</p>

<p>There are occasions, infrequent, of course, when even a bachelor
is not flattered by being accused of flirting. William's feelings
toward Miss Boke had by this time come to such a pass that he,
regarded the charge of flirting with her as little less than an
implication of grave mental deficiency. And well he remembered
how Miss Pratt, beholding his subjugated gymnastics in the dance,
had grown pink with laughter! But still the rose-leaf lips whispered:</p>

<p>"Lola saw! Lola saw bad boy Batster under dray bid tree fluttin'
wif dray bid dirl. Fluttin' all night wif dray bid 'normous dirl!"</p>

<p>Her cruelty was all unwitting; she intended to rally him sweetly.
But seventeen is deathly serious at such junctures, and William
was in a sensitive condition. He made no reply in words. Instead,
he drew himself up (from the waist, that is, because he was sitting)
with a kind of proud dignity. And that was all.</p>

<p>"Oo tross?" whispered Lola.</p>

<p>He spake not.</p>

<p>"'Twasn't my fault about dancing," she said. "Bad boy! What made
you come so late?"</p>

<p>He maintained his silence and the accompanying icy dignity, whereupon
she made a charming little pout.</p>

<p>"Oo be so tross," she said, "Lola talk to nice Man uvver side
of her!"</p>

<p>With that she turned her back upon him and prattled merrily to
the gentleman of sixteen upon her right.</p>

<p>Still and cold sat William. Let her talk to the Man at the other
side of her as she would, and never so gaily, William knew that
she was conscious every instant of the reproachful presence upon
her left. And somehow these moments of quiet and melancholy dignity
became the most satisfactory he had known that evening. For as
he sat, so silent, so austere, and not yet eating, though a plate
of chicken salad had been placed upon his lap, he began to feel
that there was somewhere about him a mysterious superiority which
set him apart from other people&mdash;and above them. This quality,
indefinable and lofty, had carried him through troubles, that
very night, which would have wrecked the lives of such simple
fellows as Joe Bullitt and Johnnie Watson. And although Miss Pratt
continued to make merry with the Man upon her right, it seemed
to William that this was but outward show. He had a strange, subtle
impression that the mysterious superiority which set him apart
from others was becoming perceptible to her&mdash;that she was feeling
it, too.</p>

<p>Alas! Such are the moments Fate seizes upon to play the clown!</p>

<p>Over the chatter and laughter of the guests rose a too familiar
voice. "Lemme he'p you to nice tongue samwich, lady. No'm? Nice
green lettuce samwich, lady?"</p>

<p>Genesis!</p>

<p>"Nice tongue samwich, suh? Nice lettuce samwich, lady?" he could
be heard vociferating&mdash;perhaps a little too much as if he had
sandwiches for sale. "Lemme jes' lay this nice green lettuce samwich
on you' plate fer you."</p>

<p>His wide-spread hand bore the tray of sandwiches high overhead,
for his style in waiting was florid, though polished. He walked
with a faint, shuffling suggestion of a prance, a lissome pomposity
adopted in obedience to the art-sense within him which bade him
harmonize himself with occasions of state and fashion. His manner
was the super-supreme expression of graciousness, but the graciousness
was innocent, being but an affectation and nothing inward&mdash;for
inwardly Genesis was humble. He was only pretending to be the
kind of waiter he would like to be.</p>

<p>And because he was a new waiter he strongly wished to show familiarity
with his duties&mdash;familiarity, in fact, with everything and everybody.
This yearning, born of self-doubt, and intensified by a slight
touch of gin, was beyond question the inspiration of his painful
behavior when he came near the circle of chairs where sat Mr.
and Mrs. Parcher, Miss Parcher, Miss Pratt, Miss Boke, Mr. Watson,
Mr. Bullitt, others&mdash;and William.</p>

<p>"Nice tongue samwich, lady!" he announced, semi-cake-walking
beneath his high-borne tray.</p>

<p>"Nice green lettuce sam&mdash;" He came suddenly to a dramatic dead-stop
as he beheld William sitting before him, wearing that strange
new dignity and Mr. Baxter's evening clothes. "Name o' goo'ness!"
Genesis exclaimed, so loudly that every one looked up. "How in
the livin' worl' you evuh come to git here? You' daddy sut'ny
mus' 'a' weakened 'way down 'fo' he let you wear his low-cut ves'
an' pants an' long-tail coat! I bet any man fifty cents you gone
an' stole 'em out aftuh he done went to bed!"</p>

<p>And he burst into a wild, free African laugh.</p>

<p>At seventeen such things are not embarrassing; they are catastrophical.
But, mercifully, catastrophes often produce a numbness in the
victims. More as in a trance than actually William heard the outbreak
of his young companions; and, during the quarter of an hour subsequent
to Genesis's performance, the oft-renewed explosions of their
mirth made but a kind of horrid buzzing in his ears. Like sounds
borne from far away were the gaspings of Mr. and Mrs. Parcher,
striving with all their strength to obtain mastery of themselves
once more.</p>

<p>... A flourish of music challenged the dancers. Couples appeared
upon the platform.</p>

<p>The dreadful supper was over.</p>

<p>The ineffable One, supremely pink, rose from her seat at William's
side and moved toward the platform with the glowing Joe Bullitt.
Then William, roused to action by this sight, sprang to his feet
and took a step toward them. But it was only one weak step.</p>

<p>A warm and ample hand placed itself firmly inside the crook of
his elbow. "Let's get started for this one before the floor gets
all crowded up," said Miss Boke.</p>

<p>Miss Boke danced and danced with him; she danced him on&mdash;and
on&mdash;and on&#11834;</p>

<p>At half past one the orchestra played "Home, Sweet Home." As
the last bars sounded, a group of earnest young men who had surrounded
the lovely guest of honor, talking vehemently, broke into loud
shouts, embraced one another and capered variously over the lawn.
Mr. Parcher beheld from a distance these manifestations, and then,
with an astonishment even more profound, took note of the tragic
William, who was running toward him, radiant &mdash;Miss Boke
hovering futilely in the far background.</p>

<p>"What's all the hullabaloo?" Mr. Parcher inquired.</p>

<p>"Miss Pratt!" gasped William. "Miss Pratt!"</p>

<p>"Well, what about her?"</p>

<p>And upon receiving William's reply, Mr. Parcher might well have
discerned behind it the invisible hand of an ironic but recompensing
Providence making things even&mdash;taking from the one to give to
the other.</p>

<p>"She's going to stay!" shouted the happy William. "She's promised
to stay another week!"</p>

<p>And then, mingling with the sounds of rejoicing, there ascended
to heaven the stricken cry of an elderly man plunging blindly
into the house in search of his wife.</p>
