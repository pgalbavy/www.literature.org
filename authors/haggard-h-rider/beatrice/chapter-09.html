<p>Geoffrey lay upon his back, watching the still patch of sunshine and
listening to the ticking of the clock, as he passed all these and many
other events in solemn review, till the series culminated in his vivid
recollection of the scene of that very morning.
</p><p>“I am sick of it,” he said at last aloud, “sick and tired. She makes my
life wretched. If it wasn’t for Effie upon my word I’d . . . By Jove, it
is three o’clock; I will go and see Miss Granger. She’s a woman, not a
female ghost at any rate, though she is a freethinker--which,” he added
as he slowly struggled off the couch, “is a very foolish thing to be.”
</p><p>Very shakily, for he was sadly knocked about, Geoffrey hobbled down the
long narrow room and through the door, which was ajar. The opposite door
was also set half open. He knocked softly, and getting no answer pushed
it wide and looked in, thinking that he had, perhaps, made some mistake
as to the room. On a sofa placed about two-thirds down its length, lay
Beatrice asleep. She was wrapped in a kind of dressing-gown of some
simple blue stuff, and all about her breast and shoulders streamed her
lovely curling hair. Her sweet face was towards him, its pallor relieved
only by the long shadow of the dark lashes and the bent bow of the lips.
One white wrist and hand hung down almost to the floor, and beneath the
spread curtain of the sunlit hair her bosom heaved softly in her sleep.
She looked so wondrously beautiful in her rest that he stopped almost
awed, and gazed, and gazed again, feeling as though a present sense and
power were stilling his heart to silence. It is dangerous to look upon
such quiet loveliness, and very dangerous to feel that pressure at the
heart. A truly wise man feeling it would have fled, knowing that seeds
sown in such silences may live to bloom upon a bitter day, and shed
their fruit into the waters of desolation. But Geoffrey was not
wise--who would have been? He still stood and gazed till the sight
stamped itself so deeply on the tablets of his heart that through all
the years to come no heats of passion, no frosts of doubt, and no sense
of loss could ever dull its memory.
</p><p>The silent sun shone on, the silent woman slept, and in silence the
watcher gazed. And as he looked a great fear, a prescience of evil that
should come, entered into Geoffrey and took possession of him. A cloud
without crossed the ray of sunlight and turned it. It wavered, for a
second it rested on his breast, flashed back to hers, then went out; and
as it flashed and died, he seemed to know that henceforth, for life till
death, ay! and beyond, his fate and that sleeping woman’s were one
fate. It was but a momentary knowledge; the fear shook him, and was gone
almost before he understood its foolishness. But it had been with him,
and in after days he remembered it.
</p><p>Just then Beatrice woke, opening her grey eyes. Their dreamy glance fell
upon him, looking through him and beyond him, rather than at him. Then
she raised herself a little and stretching out both her arms towards
him, spoke aloud.
</p><p>“So have you have come back to me at last,” she said. “I knew that you
would come and I have waited.”
</p><p>He made no answer, he did not know what to say; indeed he began to think
that he also must be dreaming. For a little while Beatrice still looked
at him in the same absent manner, then suddenly started up, the red
blood streaming to her brow.
</p><p>“Why, Mr. Bingham,” she said, “is it really you? What was it that I
said? Oh, pray forgive me, whatever it was. I have been asleep dreaming
such a curious dream, and talking in my sleep.”
</p><p>“Do not alarm yourself, Miss Granger,” he answered, recovering himself
with a jerk; “you did not say anything dreadful, only that you were glad
to see me. What were you dreaming about?”
</p><p>Beatrice looked at him doubtfully; perhaps his words did not ring quite
true.
</p><p>“I think that I had better tell you as I have said so much,” she
answered. “Besides, it was a very curious dream, and if I believed in
dreams it would rather frighten me, only fortunately I do not. Sit down
and I will tell it to you before I forget it. It is not very long.”
</p><p>He took the chair to which she pointed, and she began, speaking in the
voice of one yet laden with the memories of sleep.
</p><p>“I dreamed that I stood in space. Far to my right was a great globe of
light, and to my left was another globe, and I knew that the globes were
named Life and Death. From the globe on the right to the globe on the
left, and back again, a golden shuttle, in which two flaming eyes were
set, was shot continually, and I knew also that this was the shuttle of
Destiny, weaving the web of Fate. Presently the shuttle flew, leaving
behind it a long silver thread, and the eyes in the shuttle were such as
your eyes. Again the shuttle sped through space, and this time its eyes
were like my eyes, and the thread it left behind it was twisted from a
woman’s hair. Half way between the globes of Life and Death my thread
was broken, but the shuttle flew on and vanished. For a moment the
thread hung in air, then a wind rose and blew it, so that it floated
away like a spider’s web, till it struck upon your silver thread of life
and began to twist round and round it. As it twisted it grew larger and
heavier, till at last it was thick as a great tress of hair, and the
silver line bent beneath the weight so that I saw it soon must break.
Then while I wondered what would happen, a white hand holding a knife
slid slowly down the silver line, and with the knife severed the
wrappings of woman’s hair, which fell and floated slowly away, like a
little cloud touched with sunlight, till they were lost in darkness. But
the thread of silver that was your line of life, sprang up quivering and
making a sound like sighs, till at last it sighed itself to silence.
</p><p>“Then I seemed to sleep, and when I woke I was floating upon such a
misty sea as we saw last night. I had lost all sight of land, and I
could not remember what the stars were like, nor how I had been taught
to steer, nor understand where I must go. I called to the sea, and asked
it of the stars, and the sea answered me thus:
</p><p>“‘Hope has rent her raiment, and the stars are set.’
</p><p>“I called again, and asked of the land where I should go, and the land
did not answer, but the sea answered me a second time:
</p><p>“‘Child of the mist, wander in the mist, and in darkness seek for
light.’
</p><p>“Then I wept because Hope had rent her starry garment and in darkness I
must seek for light. And while I still wept, <u>you</u> rose out of the sea
and sat before me in the boat. I had never seen you before, and still
I felt that I had known you always. You did not speak, and I did not
speak, but you looked into my heart and saw its trouble. Then I looked
into your heart, and read what was written. And this was written:
</p><p>“‘Woman whom I knew before the Past began, and whom I shall know when
the Future is ended, why do you weep?’
</p><p>“And my heart answered, ‘I weep because I am lost upon the waters of
the earth, because Hope has rent her starry robes, and in everlasting
darkness I must seek for light that is not.’ Then your heart said, ‘_I_
will show you light,’ and bending forward you touched me on the breast.
</p><p>“And suddenly an agony shook me like the agonies of birth and death,
and the sky was full of great-winged angels who rolled up the mist as
a cloth, and drew the veils from the eyes of Night, and there, her feet
upon the globe, and her star-set head piercing the firmament of heaven,
stood Hope breathing peace and beauty. She looked north and south and
east and west, then she looked upwards through the arching vaults of
heaven, and wherever she set her eyes, bright with holy tears, the
darkness shrivelled and sorrow ceased, and from corruption arose the
Incorruptible. I gazed and worshipped, and as I did so, again the sea
spoke unquestioned:
</p><p>“‘In darkness thou hast found light, in Death seek for wisdom.’
</p><p>“Then once more Hope rent her starry robes, and the angels drew down a
veil over the eyes of Night, and the sea swallowed me, and I sank till I
reached the deep foundations of mortal death. And there in the Halls of
Death I sat for ages upon ages, till at last I saw you come, and on your
lips was the word of wisdom that makes all things clear, but what it was
I cannot remember. Then I stretched out my hand to greet you, and woke,
and that is all my dream.”
</p>
<p>Beatrice ceased, her grey eyes set wide, as though they still strove to
trace their spiritual vision upon the air of earth, her breast heaving,
and her lips apart.
</p><p>“Great heaven!” he said, “what an imagination you must have to dream
such a dream as that.”
</p><p>“Imagination,” she answered, returning to her natural manner. “I have
none, Mr. Bingham. I used to have, but I lost it when I lost--everything
else. Can you interpret my dream? Of course you cannot; it is nothing
but nonsense--such stuff as dreams are made of, that is all.”
</p><p>“It may be nonsense, I daresay it is, but it is beautiful nonsense,” he
answered. “I wish ladies had more of such stuff to give the world.”
</p><p>“Ah, well, dreams may be wiser than wakings, and nonsense than learned
talk, for all we know. But there’s an end of it. I do not know why I
repeated it to you. I am sorry that I did repeat it, but it seemed so
real it shook me out of myself. This is what comes of breaking in upon
the routine of life by being three parts drowned. One finds queer things
at the bottom of the sea, you know. By the way I hope that you are
recovering. I do not think that you will care to go canoeing again with
me, Mr. Bingham.”
</p><p>There was an opening for a compliment here, but Geoffrey felt that it
would be too much in earnest if spoken, so he resisted the temptation.
</p><p>“What, Miss Granger,” he said, “should a man say to a lady who but last
night saved his life, at the risk, indeed almost at the cost, of her
own?”
</p><p>“It was nothing,” she answered, colouring; “I clung to you, that was
all, more by instinct than from any motive. I think I had a vague idea
that you might float and support me.”
</p><p>“Miss Granger, the occasion is too serious for polite fibs. I know how
you saved my life. I do not know how to thank you for it.”
</p><p>“Then don’t thank me at all, Mr. Bingham. Why should you thank me? I
only did what I was bound to do. I would far rather die than desert a
companion in distress, of any sort; we all must die, but it would be
dreadful to die ashamed. You know what they say, that if you save a
person from drowning you will do them an injury afterwards. That is how
they put it here; in some parts the saying is the other way about, but I
am not likely ever to do you an injury, so it does not make me unhappy.
It was an awful experience: you were senseless, so you cannot know how
strange it felt lying upon the slippery rock, and seeing those great
white waves rush upon us through the gloom, with nothing but the night
above, and the sea around, and death between the two. I have been lonely
for many years, but I do not think that I ever quite understood what
loneliness really meant before. You see,” she added by way of an
afterthought, “I thought that you were dead, and there is not much
company in a corpse.”
</p><p>“Well,” he said, “one thing is, it would have been lonelier if we had
gone.”
</p><p>“Do you think so?” she answered, looking at him inquiringly. “I don’t
quite see how you make that out. If you believe in what we have been
taught, as I think you do, wherever it was you found yourself there
would be plenty of company, and if, like me, you do not believe in
anything, why, then, you would have slept, and sleep asks for nothing.”
</p><p>“Did you believe in nothing when you lay upon the rock waiting to be
drowned, Miss Granger?”
</p><p>“Nothing!” she answered; “only weak people find revelation in the
extremities of fear. If revelation comes at all, surely it must be born
in the heart and not in the senses. I believed in nothing, and I dreaded
nothing, except the agony of death. Why should I be afraid? Supposing
that I am mistaken, and there is something beyond, is it my fault that
I cannot believe? What have I done that I should be afraid? I have never
harmed anybody that I know of, and if I could believe I would. I wish
I had died,” she went on, passionately; “it would be all over now. I am
tired of the world, tired of work and helplessness, and all the little
worries which wear one out. I am not wanted here, I have nothing to live
for, and I wish that I had died!”
</p><p>“Some day you will think differently, Miss Granger. There are many
things that a woman like yourself can live for--at the least, there is
your work.”
</p><p>She laughed drearily. “My work! If you only knew what it is like you
would not talk to me about it. Every day I roll my stone up the hill,
and every night it seems to roll down again. But you have never taught
in a village school. How can you know? I work all day, and in the
evening perhaps I have to mend the tablecloths, or--what do you
think?--write my father’s sermons. It sounds curious, does it not, that
I should write sermons? But I do. I wrote the one he is going to preach
next Sunday. It makes very little difference to him what it is so long
as he can read it, and, of course, I never say anything which can offend
anybody, and I do not think that they listen much. Very few people go to
church in Bryngelly.”
</p><p>“Don’t you ever get any time to yourself, then?”
</p><p>“Oh, yes, sometimes I do, and then I go out in my canoe, or read, and am
almost happy. After all, Mr. Bingham, it is very wrong and ungrateful
of me to speak like this. I have more advantages than nine-tenths of
the world, and I ought to make the best of them. I don’t know why I have
been speaking as I have, and to you, whom I never saw till yesterday.
I never did it before to any living soul, I assure you. It is just like
the story of the man who came here last year with the divining rod.
There is a cottage down on the cliff--it belongs to Mr. Davies, who
lives in the Castle. Well, they have no drinking water near, and the new
tenant made a great fuss about it. So Mr. Davies hired men, and they dug
and dug and spent no end of money, but could not come to water. At last
the tenant fetched an old man from some parish a long way off, who said
that he could find springs with a divining rod. He was a curious old man
with a crutch, and he came with his rod, and hobbled about till at last
the rod twitched just at the tenant’s back door--at least the diviner
said it did. At any rate, they dug there, and in ten minutes struck a
spring of water, which bubbled up so strongly that it rushed into the
house and flooded it. And what do you think? After all, the water was
brackish. You are the man with the divining rod, Mr. Bingham, and you
have made me talk a great deal too much, and, after all, you see it is
not nice talk. You must think me a very disagreeable and wicked young
woman, and I daresay I am. But somehow it is a relief to open one’s
mind. I do hope, Mr. Bingham, that you will see--in short, that you will
not misunderstand me.”
</p><p>“Miss Granger,” he answered, “there is between us that which will always
entitle us to mutual respect and confidence--the link of life and
death. Had it not been for you, I should not sit here to listen to your
confidence to-day. You may tell me that a mere natural impulse prompted
you to do what you did. I know better. It was your will that triumphed
over your natural impulse towards self-preservation. Well, I will say no
more about it, except this: If ever a man was bound to a woman by ties
of gratitude and respect, I am bound to you. You need not fear that I
shall take advantage of or misinterpret your confidence.” Here he rose
and stood before her, his dark handsome face bowed in proud humility.
“Miss Granger, I look upon it as an honour done to me by one whom
henceforth I must reverence among all women. The life you gave back to
me, and the intelligence which directs it, are in duty bound to you, and
I shall not forget the debt.”
</p><p>Beatrice listened to his words, spoken in that deep and earnest voice,
which in after years became so familiar to Her Majesty’s judges and to
Parliament--listened with a new sense of pleasure rising in her heart.
She was this man’s equal; what he could dare, she could dare; where he
could climb, she could follow--ay, and if need be, show the path, and
she felt that he acknowledged it. In his sight she was something more
than a handsome girl to be admired and deferred to for her beauty’s
sake. He had placed her on another level--one, perhaps, that few women
would have wished to occupy. But Beatrice was thankful to him. It was
the first taste of supremacy that she had ever known.
</p><p>It is something to stir the proud heart of such a woman as Beatrice,
in that moment when for the first time she feels herself a conqueror,
victorious, not through the vulgar advantage of her sex, not by the
submission of man’s coarser sense, but rather by the overbalancing
weight of mind.
</p><p>“Do you know,” she said, suddenly looking up, “you make me very proud,”
 and she stretched out her hand to him.
</p><p>He took it, and, bending, touched it with his lips. There was no
possibility of misinterpreting the action, and though she coloured
a little--for, till then, no man had even kissed the tip of her
finger--she did not misinterpret it. It was an act of homage, and that
was all.
</p><p>And so they sealed the compact of their perfect friendship for ever and
a day.
</p><p>Then came a moment’s silence. It was Geoffrey who broke it.
</p><p>“Miss Granger,” he said, “will you allow me to preach you a lecture, a
very short one?”
</p><p>“Go on,” she said.
</p><p>“Very well. Do not blame me if you don’t like it, and do not set me down
as a prig, though I am going to tell you your faults as I read them in
your own words. You are proud and ambitious, and the cramped lines in
which you are forced to live seem to strangle you. You have suffered,
and have not learned the lesson of suffering--humility. You have set
yourself up against Fate, and Fate sweeps you along like spray upon
the gale, yet you go unwilling. In your impatience you have flown to
learning for refuge, and it has completed your overthrow, for it has
induced you to reject as non-existent all that you cannot understand.
Because your finite mind cannot search infinity, because no answer has
come to all your prayers, because you see misery and cannot read its
purpose, because you suffer and have not found rest, you have said there
is naught but chance, and become an atheist, as many have done before
you. Is it not true?”
</p><p>“Go on,” she answered, bowing her head to her breast so that the long
rippling hair almost hid her face.
</p><p>“It seems a little odd,” Geoffrey said with a short laugh, “that I,
with all my imperfections heaped upon me, should presume to preach to
you--but you will know best how near or how far I am from the truth. So
I want to say something. I have lived for thirty-five years, and seen a
good deal and tried to learn from it, and I know this. In the long run,
unless we of our own act put away the opportunity, the world gives us
our due, which generally is not much. So much for things temporal.
If you are fit to rule, in time you will rule; if you do not, then
be content and acknowledge your own incapacity. And as for things
spiritual, I am sure of this--though of course one does not like to talk
much of these matters--if you only seek for them long enough in some
shape you will find them, though the shape may not be that which is
generally recognised by any particular religion. But to build a wall
deliberately between oneself and the unseen, and then complain that the
way is barred, is simply childish.”
</p><p>“And what if one’s wall is built, Mr. Bingham?”
</p><p>“Most of us have done something in that line at different times,” he
answered, “and found a way round it.”
</p><p>“And if it stretches from horizon to horizon, and is higher than the
clouds, what then?”
</p><p>“Then you must find wings and fly over it.”
</p><p>“And where can any earthly woman find those spiritual wings?” she
asked, and then sank her head still deeper on her breast to cover her
confusion. For she remembered that she had heard of wanderers in the
dusky groves of human passion, yes, even Mænad wanderers, who had
suddenly come face to face with their own soul; and that the cruel paths
of earthly love may yet lead the feet which tread them to the ivory
gates of heaven.
</p><p>And remembering these beautiful myths, though she had no experience of
love, and knew little of its ways, Beatrice grew suddenly silent. Nor
did Geoffrey give her an answer, though he need scarcely have feared to
do so.
</p><p>For were they not discussing a purely abstract question?
