<p>The beautiful weather continued unchanged throughout the afternoon.
As the sun declined in the sky there was a perceptible coolness
in the air, but the exercise of riding removed all necessity for
using their blankets.</p>

<p>Although the party had been edging toward the foot-hills for
hours, it seemed to the boys that they were as far off as ever.
They had covered many miles, but those who have travelled in the
West know the deceptive character of the crystalline atmosphere,
so far as distances are concerned. However, as twilight began
closing in they reached a small grove of trees, which was the
destination of the guide from the first. It was there he meant
to camp for the night, and he could not have selected a better
place had he spent a week in looking for it.</p>

<p>The grove covered less than an acre, the trees standing well
apart, and wholly free from brush and undergrowth. Thus even the
horses could pass back and forth freely. Over this shaded space
the dark-green grass grew luxuriantly, with a soft juiciness of
texture which made it the ideal food for cattle and horses. In
the middle of the grove bubbled a spring of clear cold water,
whose winding course could be traced far out on the plain by the
fringe of deeper green which accompanied it.</p>

<p>Saddles and bridles were removed, and the ponies turned free
to crop the grass until they were filled, when they would lie
down for the night. The blankets were spread on the ground near
the spring, and then, at the suggestion of Hazletine, all three
joined in gathering dried branches and limbs with which to start
a fire. It was now cool enough to make the warmth welcome, while
the flame would add to the cheerfulness of the occasion.</p>

<p>Jack and Fred had never ridden so far at one stretch, and when
they reclined on their blankets to watch Hank start the fire they
were thoroughly tired out; but it seemed to them their hunger
was more ravenous than ever. Each forbore to speak of it, but
the deliberation of their friend in preparing the meal was almost
intolerable.</p>

<p>The first night spent by the boys in camping out in the wilds
of Wyoming was one that can never be forgotten. When the meal
was finished and the last vestige of food eaten, the three stretched
out where they could feel the grateful warmth of the fire that
had been kindled against the trunk of a large oak. Hank had again
lighted his pipe, and deeply interested Jack and Fred by his reminiscences
of a life that had been filled to overflowing with strange experience
and adventure. They listened, unconscious of the passage of the
hours, until he abruptly asked:</p>

<p>"What time is it?"</p>

<p>Each youth looked at his watch, and, to his astonishment, saw
that it was nearly half-past ten. They had supposed that it was
fully two hours earlier.</p>

<p>"One of the rules that must always be follered," said the guide,
"when hunting or away from home, is that all the party mustn't
sleep at the same time."</p>

<p>"Then one has to stand watch?"</p>

<p>"It looks that way. Now, we'll divide the time atween us, each
taking a part, so that it won't come heavy on any one."</p>

<p>"That will suit us," Fred hastened to say, while Jack nodded
his head.</p>

<p>"All right. You, Jack, will keep watch till twelve&mdash;that is midnight;
then you'll rouse t'other younker, and he'll stand guard till
two; then he'll give me a kick, and I'll run things till daylight."</p>

<p>"What are we likely to see?" asked Jack, who naturally desired
to learn all the points concerning his new duties.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" asked Hank, with a grin. "There may be wild
animals, sich as grizzlies, cinnamon or black bears; there may
be wolves, or dog Injins looking for a chance to steal our ponies."</p>

<p>"Why do you call them 'dog Indians?'"</p>

<p>"A dog Injin is a tramp 'mong the other tribes; he don't live
much with any of 'em, but sneaks round the country, looking for
a chance to steal something, and it don't matter what it is."</p>

<p>"Suppose I catch sight of one of the animals you name, or a dog
Indian&mdash;what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Shoot him quicker'n lightning."</p>

<p>This was a startling order, but the guide was in earnest.</p>

<p>"Are you afeard to do it?" he asked, half contemptuously.</p>

<p>"No; I'll shoot the instant it is necessary, but I don't fancy
the idea of picking off an Indian without warning."</p>

<p>"If you give him warning you won't pick him off. If you're so
squeamish, you might argufy the matter with him."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me; I'm on duty now; go to sleep."</p>

<p>Without another word the guide wrapped his blanket about him
and stretched out in front of the fire, with his feet toward it.
Judging from his heavy breathing, it was barely five minutes before
he became unconscious.</p>

<p>"It strikes me this is rushing things," remarked Jack to Fred,
as the two sat beside each other. "Last night the 'V. W. W.' were
in the sleeper of the Union Pacific; to-night they are looking
out for a chance to shoot Indians."</p>

<p>"I don't believe there's any likelihood of finding it. I suspect
that Hank is having some sport at our expense. If there was any
danger he would stay awake himself, instead of trusting two tenderfeet
like us."</p>

<p>"It may be, but we are in a wild country, where danger is likely
to come at any time, and we may have our hands full. It seems
to me that it would have been better to let the fire go out, and
not attract attention."</p>

<p>"He's running this affair; he wouldn't have had so much wood
gathered if he didn't mean to keep the blaze going."</p>

<p>With this Fred rose to his feet and flung an armful of wood on
the flames, which brightened up until their reflection was thrown
against the branches overhead and well out toward the edge of
the grove. A faint whinny proved that the horses had been disturbed
by the increase in the illumination.</p>

<p>Before lying down, Fred looked at his chum.</p>

<p>"I wonder, Jack, whether there's any risk of your falling asleep?"</p>

<p>"There would be if I remained seated on the ground, but I shall
not do that."</p>

<p>"It will be dangerous to walk back and forth, where the fire
shows you plainly."</p>

<p>"My plan is to move out in the grove, where the firelight will
not strike me, and stand close to the trunk of one of the trees.
I have heard of folks sleeping on their feet, but there's no fear
of my doing it. Since I am to call you in less than two hours,
Fred, you would better get sleep while you can."</p>

<p>The younger lad bade his friend good-night and imitated the action
of Hank Hazletine, wrapping his blanket around himself and lying
down near the fire. He was not quite so prompt in sinking into
slumber, but it was not long before Jack Dudley was the only one
of the little party in command of his senses.</p>

<p>Jack, like his companions, felt the need of sleep, but the fact
that he had but a brief while to remain awake, and the consciousness
that the safety of others, as well as his own, rested upon himself,
made him very alert. He believed he could sit or recline on the
ground and retain his wits, but, fortunately, he had too much
prudence to run that risk. Sleep is so insidious a foe that we
can never recall the moment when it overmasters us, nor can we
fight it off when in a prone or easy posture.</p>

<p>He adhered to the plan he had formed. Winchester in hand, he
moved away from the fire until, by interposing the large trunk
of a tree between himself and the light, he was invisible from
that direction. He stood erect, taking care not to lean against
the trunk for partial support, and concentrated his faculties
into those of listening and looking.</p>

<p>The stillness was profound. From the distant mountains to the
westward came a low, soft, almost inaudible murmur, such as one
hears when many miles from the calm ocean, and which has been
called the voice of silence itself. In the stillness he heard
the faint crackle of one of the embers as it fell apart, and,
though the night wind scarcely stirred the leaves over his head,
he caught the rustle. The fact that there was nothing from the
direction of the ponies showed they had ceased to crop the grass
and were lying down. The safety of the camp was in his hands.
If he forgot his duty, it might be fatal to all.</p>

<p>The sense of this responsibility and the newness of his position
made Jack Dudley more wakeful than he could have been under any
other circumstances. To these causes, also, was due a suspicious
nervousness which made him see danger where it did not exist.
The rustling of a falling leaf caused him to start and glance
furtively to one side, and at a soft stir of the leaves under
a breath of wind, or a slight movement of the sleeping ponies,
he started and grasped his rifle with closer grip.</p>

<p>All this was natural; but there came a moment, not far from midnight,
when there remained no doubt that some person or animal was moving
stealthily through the grove, near where he was standing. It will
be remembered that his position was such that the trunk of the
large oak acted as an impenetrable screen between him and the
camp-fire, which was burning so vigorously that its rays penetrated
to a greater or less degree beyond him. Thus he could see anything
moving within the circle of illumination, while he was as invisible
to the keenest-eyed warrior as if the night was without a ray
of light.</p>

<p>The first warning was through the sense of hearing. He had been
deceived so many times that he suspected his fancy was playing
with him again, but the faint <em>tip, tip</em> continued until
such explanation was amiss.</p>

<p>"It is an Indian or a wild beast," was his belief.</p>

<p>The next minute he knew that, whatever it was, its position was
between him and the outer edge of the grove. Since the ponies
were on the opposite side of the fire, Jack was nearer the intruder
than either they or his friends, sleeping by the camp-fire. Recalling
that his place was the most favorable possible, he remained as
motionless as the tree-trunk behind him, and to which he stood
close enough to touch by moving his foot a few inches backward.</p>

<p>The situation being thus, it followed that if the man or beast
continued its advance it must come into sight, while Jack himself
was invisible. He therefore held his Winchester ready for instant
use and waited.</p>

<p>He was standing in this expectant attitude when a remarkable
thing took place. The fire, having remained unreplenished for
some time, had subsided to a considerable extent, when one of
the embers fell apart and caused such a displacement of the burning
wood that the light flared up and penetrated with its former vigor
beyond the tree which sheltered the sentinel.</p>

<p>Jack was as immovable as a statue, his weapon grasped in both
hands, when this sudden brightening occurred. He was peering out
among the dark trees, in the effort to identify the danger, when
he saw the unmistakable figure of an Indian, hardly twenty feet
away.</p>

<p>The buck had entered the grove with the silence of a shadow,
and was making his way to the camp-fire, when betrayed in this
singular manner to the watcher. In the reflection of the firelight,
his naturally hideous countenance was repulsive to the last degree.
The features were irregular, with prominent cheek-bones, a huge
nose, and a retreating chin. Ugly as nature had made him, he had
intensified it himself by daubing black, red and white paint in
splashes over the front of his countenance. His coarse, black
hair dangled loosely about his shoulders, and a single stained
eagle's feather protruded from the crown. It was gathered back
of the neck by a thong of some sort, so as to prevent the hair
getting in his eyes when there was such imminent need for their
use.</p>

<p>The chest was bare to the waist, and was also fantastically painted.
In the girdle which encircled his waist was thrust a knife, whose
handle protruded, while the leggings and moccasins were gayly
ornamented and fringed. He held a formidable rifle in his right
hand, in a trailing position, and was leaning well forward, with
his body bent, as he drew near the camp with that stoical patience
which the American race shows in the most trying crises. If necessary,
he would continue this cautious advance for hours without showing
haste, for it is often that his people circumvent and overthrow
an enemy by their incomparable caution and care.</p>

<p>One peculiar feature of the unexpected flaring-up of the light
was that its strongest force impinged directly upon the painted
face of the Indian, which was seen as plainly by Jack Dudley as
if the sun were shining. The youth felt that he could not forget
that countenance if he saw it a hundred years afterward.</p>

<p>Had Jack followed the instruction of their guide he would have
leveled his Winchester and shot the Indian dead in his tracks.
The fellow was stealing into camp in such a manner that there
could be no doubt the least crime he meant to commit was to steal.
No ranchman or hunter would hesitate a moment, under the circumstances,
to give him his eternal quietus.</p>

<p>But Jack Dudley could not do such a thing. To him it was an awful
act to shoot a person, even though a savage, and his conscience
would never permit him to do so until there was no choice left
to him. He would much prefer to frighten away this intruder than
to kill him.</p>

<p>The youth was so confident of his command of the situation that
he would have felt hardly a thrill of alarm, but for the fear
that the redskin belonged to a party near at hand who had sent
him forward as a scout. Manifestly the right course for the sentinel
was to discharge his gun, thus scaring the Indian and awaking
Hazletine; but, while debating the question with himself, he became
aware that the hostile was advancing.</p>

<p>The fellow did this with such marvellous cunning that Jack perceived
no movement of his legs or feet. The latter were partly shrouded
in shadow, but the Indian himself suggested a statue set up among
the trees. Nevertheless he was inching toward the camp-fire, and
was already a couple of yards nearer Jack than when the latter
first noticed him.</p>

<p>Had he approached from the other side the youth never would have
discovered his danger; but now he had his eye on the enemy, and
meant to keep it there until the crisis was over. It was perhaps
ten minutes later that the buck was within six feet of the youth,
who, noiselessly bringing his Winchester to a level, took one
step toward him and asked:</p>

<p><em>"Well, my friend, what do you want?"</em></p>
