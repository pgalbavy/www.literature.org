On the following day, a little after four o'clock, Adam set out for
Mercy.
<P>
He was home just as the clocks were striking six.  He was pale and
upset, but otherwise looked strong and alert.  The old man summed up
his appearance and manner thus:  "Braced up for battle."
<P>
"Now!" said Sir Nathaniel, and settled down to listen, looking at
Adam steadily and listening attentively that he might miss nothing--
even the inflection of a word.
<P>
"I found Lilla and Mimi at home.  Watford had been detained by
business on the farm.  Miss Watford received me as kindly as before;
Mimi, too, seemed glad to see me.  Mr. Caswall came so soon after I
arrived, that he, or someone on his behalf, must have been watching
for me.  He was followed closely by the negro, who was puffing hard
as if he had been running--so it was probably he who watched.  Mr.
Caswall was very cool and collected, but there was a more than
usually iron look about his face that I did not like.  However, we
got on very well.  He talked pleasantly on all sorts of questions.
The nigger waited a while and then disappeared as on the other
occasion.  Mr. Caswall's eyes were as usual fixed on Lilla.  True,
they seemed to be very deep and earnest, but there was no offence in
them.  Had it not been for the drawing down of the brows and the
stern set of the jaws, I should not at first have noticed anything.
But the stare, when presently it began, increased in intensity.  I
could see that Lilla began to suffer from nervousness, as on the
first occasion; but she carried herself bravely.  However, the more
nervous she grew, the harder Mr. Caswall stared.  It was evident to
me that he had come prepared for some sort of mesmeric or hypnotic
battle.  After a while he began to throw glances round him and then
raised his hand, without letting either Lilla or Mimi see the
action.  It was evidently intended to give some sign to the negro,
for he came, in his usual stealthy way, quietly in by the hall door,
which was open.  Then Mr. Caswall's efforts at staring became
intensified, and poor Lilla's nervousness grew greater.  Mimi,
seeing that her cousin was distressed, came close to her, as if to
comfort or strengthen her with the consciousness of her presence.
This evidently made a difficulty for Mr. Caswall, for his efforts,
without appearing to get feebler, seemed less effective.  This
continued for a little while, to the gain of both Lilla and Mimi.
Then there was a diversion.  Without word or apology the door
opened, and Lady Arabella March entered the room.  I had seen her
coming through the great window.  Without a word she crossed the
room and stood beside Mr. Caswall.  It really was very like a fight
of a peculiar kind; and the longer it was sustained the more
earnest--the fiercer--it grew.  That combination of forces--the
over-lord, the white woman, and the black man--would have cost some-
-probably all of them--their lives in the Southern States of
America.  To us it was simply horrible.  But all that you can
understand.  This time, to go on in sporting phrase, it was
understood by all to be a 'fight to a finish,' and the mixed group
did not slacken a moment or relax their efforts.  On Lilla the
strain began to tell disastrously.  She grew pale--a patchy pallor,
which meant that her nerves were out of order.  She trembled like an
aspen, and though she struggled bravely, I noticed that her legs
would hardly support her.  A dozen times she seemed about to
collapse in a faint, but each time, on catching sight of Mimi's
eyes, she made a fresh struggle and pulled through.
<P>
"By now Mr. Caswall's face had lost its appearance of passivity.
His eyes glowed with a fiery light.  He was still the old Roman in
inflexibility of purpose; but grafted on to the Roman was a new
Berserker fury.  His companions in the baleful work seemed to have
taken on something of his feeling.  Lady Arabella looked like a
soulless, pitiless being, not human, unless it revived old legends
of transformed human beings who had lost their humanity in some
transformation or in the sweep of natural savagery.  As for the
negro--well, I can only say that it was solely due to the self-
restraint which you impressed on me that I did not wipe him out as
he stood--without warning, without fair play--without a single one
of the graces of life and death.  Lilla was silent in the helpless
concentration of deadly fear; Mimi was all resolve and self-
forgetfulness, so intent on the soul-struggle in which she was
engaged that there was no possibility of any other thought.  As for
myself, the bonds of will which held me inactive seemed like bands
of steel which numbed all my faculties, except sight and hearing.
We seemed fixed in an IMPASSE.  Something must happen, though the
power of guessing was inactive.  As in a dream, I saw Mimi's hand
move restlessly, as if groping for something.  Mechanically it
touched that of Lilla, and in that instant she was transformed.  It
was as if youth and strength entered afresh into something already
dead to sensibility and intention.  As if by inspiration, she
grasped the other's band with a force which blenched the knuckles.
Her face suddenly flamed, as if some divine light shone through it.
Her form expanded till it stood out majestically.  Lifting her right
hand, she stepped forward towards Caswall, and with a bold sweep of
her arm seemed to drive some strange force towards him.  Again and
again was the gesture repeated, the man falling back from her at
each movement.  Towards the door he retreated, she following.  There
was a sound as of the cooing sob of doves, which seemed to multiply
and intensify with each second.  The sound from the unseen source
rose and rose as he retreated, till finally it swelled out in a
triumphant peal, as she with a fierce sweep of her arm, seemed to
hurl something at her foe, and he, moving his hands blindly before
his face, appeared to be swept through the doorway and out into the
open sunlight.
<P>
"All at once my own faculties were fully restored; I could see and
hear everything, and be fully conscious of what was going on.  Even
the figures of the baleful group were there, though dimly seen as
through a veil--a shadowy veil.  I saw Lilla sink down in a swoon,
and Mimi throw up her arms in a gesture of triumph.  As I saw her
through the great window, the sunshine flooded the landscape, which,
however, was momentarily becoming eclipsed by an onrush of a myriad
birds."
<P>
By the next morning, daylight showed the actual danger which
threatened.  From every part of the eastern counties reports were
received concerning the enormous immigration of birds.  Experts were
sending--on their own account, on behalf of learned societies, and
through local and imperial governing bodies--reports dealing with
the matter, and suggesting remedies.
<P>
The reports closer to home were even more disturbing.  All day long
it would seem that the birds were coming thicker from all quarters.
Doubtless many were going as well as coming, but the mass seemed
never to get less.  Each bird seemed to sound some note of fear or
anger or seeking, and the whirring of wings never ceased nor
lessened.  The air was full of a muttered throb.  No window or
barrier could shut out the sound, till the ears of any listener
became dulled by the ceaseless murmur.  So monotonous it was, so
cheerless, so disheartening, so melancholy, that all longed, but in
vain, for any variety, no matter how terrible it might be.
<P>
The second morning the reports from all the districts round were
more alarming than ever.  Farmers began to dread the coming of
winter as they saw the dwindling of the timely fruitfulness of the
earth.  And as yet it was only a warning of evil, not the evil
accomplished; the ground began to look bare whenever some passing
sound temporarily frightened the birds.
<P>
Edgar Caswall tortured his brain for a long time unavailingly, to
think of some means of getting rid of what he, as well as his
neighbours, had come to regard as a plague of birds.  At last he
recalled a circumstance which promised a solution of the difficulty.
The experience was of some years ago in China, far up-country,
towards the head-waters of the Yang-tze-kiang, where the smaller
tributaries spread out in a sort of natural irrigation scheme to
supply the wilderness of paddy-fields.  It was at the time of the
ripening rice, and the myriads of birds which came to feed on the
coming crop was a serious menace, not only to the district, but to
the country at large.  The farmers, who were more or less afflicted
with the same trouble every season, knew how to deal with it.  They
made a vast kite, which they caused to be flown over the centre spot
of the incursion.  The kite was shaped like a great hawk; and the
moment it rose into the air the birds began to cower and seek
protection--and then to disappear.  So long as that kite was flying
overhead the birds lay low and the crop was saved.  Accordingly
Caswall ordered his men to construct an immense kite, adhering as
well as they could to the lines of a hawk.  Then he and his men,
with a sufficiency of cord, began to fly it high overhead.  The
experience of China was repeated.  The moment the kite rose, the
birds hid or sought shelter.  The following morning, the kite was
still flying high, no bird was to be seen as far as the eye could
reach from Castra Regis.  But there followed in turn what proved
even a worse evil.  All the birds were cowed; their sounds stopped.
Neither song nor chirp was heard--silence seemed to have taken the
place of the normal voices of bird life.  But that was not all.  The
silence spread to all animals.
<P>
The fear and restraint which brooded amongst the denizens of the air
began to affect all life.  Not only did the birds cease song or
chirp, but the lowing of the cattle ceased in the fields and the
varied sounds of life died away.  In place of these things was only
a soundless gloom, more dreadful, more disheartening, more soul-
killing than any concourse of sounds, no matter how full of fear and
dread.  Pious individuals put up constant prayers for relief from
the intolerable solitude.  After a little there were signs of
universal depression which those who ran might read.  One and all,
the faces of men and women seemed bereft of vitality, of interest,
of thought, and, most of all, of hope.  Men seemed to have lost the
power of expression of their thoughts.  The soundless air seemed to
have the same effect as the universal darkness when men gnawed their
tongues with pain.
<P>
From this infliction of silence there was no relief.  Everything was
affected; gloom was the predominant note.  Joy appeared to have
passed away as a factor of life, and this creative impulse had
nothing to take its place.  That giant spot in high air was a plague
of evil influence.  It seemed like a new misanthropic belief which
had fallen on human beings, carrying with it the negation of all
hope.
<P>
After a few days, men began to grow desperate; their very words as
well as their senses seemed to be in chains.  Edgar Caswall again
tortured his brain to find any antidote or palliative of this
greater evil than before.  He would gladly have destroyed the kite,
or caused its flying to cease; but the instant it was pulled down,
the birds rose up in even greater numbers; all those who depended in
any way on agriculture sent pitiful protests to Castra Regis.
<P>
It was strange indeed what influence that weird kite seemed to
exercise.  Even human beings were affected by it, as if both it and
they were realities.  As for the people at Mercy Farm, it was like a
taste of actual death.  Lilla felt it most.  If she had been indeed
a real dove, with a real kite hanging over her in the air, she could
not have been more frightened or more affected by the terror this
created.
<P>
Of course, some of those already drawn into the vortex noticed the
effect on individuals.  Those who were interested took care to
compare their information.  Strangely enough, as it seemed to the
others, the person who took the ghastly silence least to heart was
the negro.  By nature he was not sensitive to, or afflicted by,
nerves.  This alone would not have produced the seeming
indifference, so they set their minds to discover the real cause.
Adam came quickly to the conclusion that there was for him some
compensation that the others did not share; and he soon believed
that that compensation was in one form or another the enjoyment of
the sufferings of others.  Thus the black had a never-failing source
of amusement.
<P>
Lady Arabella's cold nature rendered her immune to anything in the
way of pain or trouble concerning others.  Edgar Caswall was far too
haughty a person, and too stern of nature, to concern himself about
poor or helpless people, much less the lower order of mere animals.
Mr. Watford, Mr. Salton, and Sir Nathaniel were all concerned in the
issue, partly from kindness of heart--for none of them could see
suffering, even of wild birds, unmoved--and partly on account of
their property, which had to be protected, or ruin would stare them
in the face before long.
<P>
Lilla suffered acutely.  As time went on, her face became pinched,
and her eyes dull with watching and crying.  Mimi suffered too on
account of her cousin's suffering.  But as she could do nothing, she
resolutely made up her mind to self-restraint and patience.  Adam's
frequent visits comforted her.
