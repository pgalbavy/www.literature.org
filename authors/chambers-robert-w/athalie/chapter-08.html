<p>Before February had ended C. Bailey, Jr., and Athalie Greensleeve
had been to more than one play, had dined and supped together
more than once at the Regina.</p>

<p>The magnificence of the most fashionable restaurant in town had
thrilled and enchanted Athalie. At close range for the first time
she had an opportunity to inspect the rich, the fashionable, and
the great. As for celebrities, they seemed to be merely a by-product
of the gay, animated, beautifully gowned throngs: people she had
heard of, people more important still of whom she had never heard,
people important only to themselves of whom nobody had ever heard
thronged the great rococo rooms. The best hotel orchestra in America
played there; the loveliest flowers, the most magnificent jewels,
the most celebrated cuisine in the entire Republic&mdash;all were there
for Athalie Greensleeve to wonder at and to enjoy. There were
other things for her to wonder at, too,&mdash;the seemingly exhaustless
list of C. Bailey, Jr.'s, acquaintances; for he was always nodding
to somebody or returning salutes wherever they were, in the theatre,
or the street, in his little limousine car, at restaurants. Men
sometimes came up and spoke and were presented to Athalie: women,
never.</p>

<p>But although she was very happy after her first evening out with
C. Bailey, Jr., she realised that a serious inroad upon her savings
was absolutely necessary if she were to continue her maiden's
progress with this enchanting young man. Clothing of a very different
species than any she had ever permitted herself was now becoming
a necessity. She made the inroad. It was worth while if only to
see his surprise and his na√Øve pride in her.</p>

<p>And truly the girl was very lovely in the few luxuries she ventured
to acquire&mdash;so lovely, indeed, that many heads turned and many
eyes followed her calm and graceful progress in theatre aisle,
amid thronged tables, on the Avenue, anywhere and everywhere she
moved along the path of life now already in flowery bloom for
her.</p>

<p>And beside her, eager, happy, flattered, walked C. Bailey, Jr.,
very conscious that he was being envied; very proud of the beautiful
young girl with whom he was so constantly identifying himself,
and who, very obviously, was doing him honour.</p>

<p>Of his gratified and flattered self-esteem the girl was unconscious;
that he was really happy with her, proud of her appearance, kind
to her beyond reason and even beyond propriety perhaps,&mdash;invariably
courteous and considerate, she was vividly aware. And it made
her intensely happy to know that she gave him pleasure and to
accept it from him.</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> pleasure to Clive; but not entirely unmitigated.
His father asked him once or twice who the girl was of whom "people"
were talking; and when his son said: "She's absolutely all right,
father," Bailey, Sr., knew that she was&mdash;so far.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "C. Bailey, Jr., and Athalie Greensleeve ... had
supped together more than once at the Regina."]</p>

<p>"But what's the use, Clive?" he asked with a sort of sad humour.
"Is it necessary for you, too, to follow the path of the calf?"</p>

<p>"I like her."</p>

<p>"And other men are inclined to, and have no opportunity; is that
it, my son? The fascination of monopoly? The chicken with the
worm?"</p>

<p>"I <em>like</em> her," repeated Clive, Jr., a trifle annoyed.</p>

<p>"So you have remarked before. Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember that charming little child in the red hood and
cloak down at Greensleeve's tavern when we were duck-shooting?"</p>

<p>"Is <em>that</em> the girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What is she?"</p>

<p>"Stenographer."</p>

<p>Bailey, Sr., shrugged his shoulders, patiently.</p>

<p>"What's the <em>use</em>, Clive?"</p>

<p>"Use? Well there's no particular use. I'm not in love with her.
Did you think I was?"</p>

<p>"I don't think any more. Your mother does that for me.... Don't
make anybody unhappy, my son."</p>

<p>His mother, also, had made very frank representations to him
on several occasions, the burden of them being that common people
beget common ideas, common associations corrupt good manners,
and that "nice" girls would continue to view with disdain and
might ultimately ostracise any misguided young man of their own
caste who played about with a woman for whose existence nobody
who was anybody could account.</p>

<p>"The daughter of a Long Island road-house keeper! Why, Clive!
where is your sense of fitness! Men don't do that sort of thing
any more!"</p>

<p>"What sort of thing, mother?"</p>

<p>"What you are doing."</p>

<p>"What am I doing?"</p>

<p>"Parading a very conspicuous young woman about town."</p>

<p>"If you saw her in somebody's drawing-room you'd merely think
her beautiful and well-bred."</p>

<p>"Clive! Will you please awake from that silly dream?"</p>

<p>"That's the truth, mother. And if she spoke it would merely confirm
the impression. You won't believe it but it's true."</p>

<p>"That's absurd, Clive! She may not be uneducated but she certainly
cannot be either cultivated or well-bred."</p>

<p>"She is cultivating herself."</p>

<p>"Then for goodness' sake let her do it! It's praiseworthy and
commendable for a working girl to try to better herself. But it
doesn't concern you."</p>

<p>"Why not? If a business girl does better herself and fit herself
for a better social environment, it seems to me her labour is
in vain if people within the desired environment snub her."</p>

<p>"What kind of argument is that? Socialistic? I merely know it
is unbaked. What theory is it, dear?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Beside her, eager, happy, flattered, walked C.
Bailey, Jr., very conscious that he was being envied."]</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is. It seems reasonable to me, mother."</p>

<p>"Clive, are you trying to make yourself sentimentalise over that
Greensleeve woman?"</p>

<p>"I told you that I am not in love with her; nor is she with me.
It's an agreeable and happy comradeship; that's all."</p>

<p>"People think it something more," retorted his mother, curtly.</p>

<p>"That's their fault, not Athalie's and not mine."</p>

<p>"Then, why do you go about with her? <em>Why?</em> You know girls
enough, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Plenty. They resemble one another to the verge of monotony."</p>

<p>"Is that the way you regard the charming, well-born, well-bred,
clever, cultivated girls of your own circle, whose parents were
the friends of your parents?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I like them of course.... But there's something
about a business girl&mdash;a girl in the making&mdash;that is more amusing,
more companionable, more interesting. A business girl seems to
wear better. She's better worth talking to, listening to,&mdash;it's
better fun to go about with her, see things with her, discuss
things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What on earth are you talking about! It's perfect babble; it's
nonsense! If you really believe you have a penchant for sturdy
and rather grubby worthiness unadorned you are mistaken. The inclination
you have is merely for a pretty face and figure. I know you. If
I don't, who does! You're rather a fastidious young man, even
finicky, and very, very much accustomed to the best and only the
best. Don't talk to me about your disinterested admiration for
a working girl. You haven't anything in common with her, and you
never could have. And you'd better be very careful not to make
a fool of yourself."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"As all men are likely to do at your callow age."</p>

<p>"Fall in love with her?"</p>

<p>"You can call it that. The result is always deplorable. And if
she's a smart, selfish, and unscrupulous girl, the result may
be more deplorable still, as far as we all are concerned. What
is the need of my saying this? You are grown; you know it already.
Up to the present time you've kept fastidiously clear of such
entanglements. You say you have, and your father and I believe
you. So what is the use of beginning now,&mdash;creating an unfortunate
impression in your own set, spending your time with such a girl
as this Greensleeve girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, "you're going about this matter in the wrong
way. I am not in love with Athalie Greensleeve. But there is no
girl I like better, none perhaps I like quite as well. Let me
alone. There's no sentiment between her and me so far. There won't
be any&mdash;unless you and other people begin to drive us toward each
other. I don't want you to do that. Don't interfere. Let us alone.
We're having a good time,&mdash;a perfectly natural, wholesome, happy
time together."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'I <em>like</em> her,' repeated Clive, Jr., a
trifle annoyed."]</p>

<p>"What is it leading to?" demanded his mother impatiently.</p>

<p>"To nothing except more good times. That's absolutely all. That's
all that good times lead to where any of the girls you approve
of are concerned&mdash;not to sentiment, not to love, merely to more
good times. Why on earth can't people understand that even if
the girl happens to be earning her own living?"</p>

<p>"People don't understand. That is the truth, and you can't alter
it, Clive. The girl's reputation will always suffer. And that's
where you ought to show yourself generous."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"If you really like and respect her."</p>

<p>"How am I to show myself generous, as you put it?"</p>

<p>"By keeping away from her."</p>

<p>"Because people gossip?"</p>

<p>"Because," said his mother sharply, "they'll think the girl is
your mistress if you continue to decorate public resorts with
her."</p>

<p>"Would&mdash;<em>you</em> think so, mother?"</p>

<p>"No. You happen to be my son. And you're truthful. Otherwise
I'd think so."</p>

<p>"You would?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"That's rotten," he said, slowly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive, don't be a fool. You can't do what you're doing without
arousing suspicion everywhere&mdash;from a village sewing-circle to
the smartest gathering on Manhattan Island! You know it."</p>

<p>"I have never thought about it."</p>

<p>"Then think of it now. Whether it's rotten, as you say, or not,
it's so. It's one of the folk-ways of the human species. And if
it is, merely saying it's rotten can't alter it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bailey's car was at the door; Clive took the great sable
coat from the maid who brought it and slipped it over the handsome
afternoon gown that his handsome mother wore.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood, looking at her almost curiously&mdash;at the
brilliant black eyes, the clear smooth olive skin still youthful
enough to be attractive, at the red lips, mostly nature's hue,
at the cheeks where the delicate carmine flush was still mostly
nature's.</p>

<p>He said: "You have so much, mother.... It seems strange you should
not be more generous to a girl you have never seen."</p>

<p>His handsome, capable, and experienced mother gazed at him out
of friendly and amused eyes from which delusion had long since
fled. And that is where she fell short, for delusion is the offspring
of imagination; and without imagination no intelligence is complete.
She said: "I can be generous with any woman except where my son
concerns himself with her. Where anybody else's son is involved
I could be generous to any girl, even&mdash;" she smiled her brilliant
smile&mdash;"even perhaps not too maliciously generous. But the situation
in your case doesn't appeal to me as humorous. Keep away from
her, Clive; it's easier than ultimately to run away from her."</p>
