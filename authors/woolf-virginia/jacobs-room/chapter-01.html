<p>"So of course," wrote Betty Flanders, pressing her heels rather
deeper in the sand, "there was nothing for it but to leave."</p>

<p>Slowly welling from the point of her gold nib, pale blue ink
dissolved the full stop; for there her pen stuck; her eyes fixed,
and tears slowly filled them. The entire bay quivered; the lighthouse
wobbled; and she had the illusion that the mast of Mr. Connor's
little yacht was bending like a wax candle in the sun. She winked
quickly. Accidents were awful things. She winked again. The mast
was straight; the waves were regular; the lighthouse was upright;
but the blot had spread.</p>

<p>"... nothing for it but to leave," she read.</p>

<p>"Well, if Jacob doesn't want to play" (the shadow of Archer,
her eldest son, fell across the notepaper and looked blue on the
sand, and she felt chilly&mdash;it was the third of September already),
"if Jacob doesn't want to play"&mdash;what a horrid blot! It must be
getting late.</p>

<p>"Where IS that tiresome little boy?" she said. "I don't see him.
Run and find him. Tell him to come at once." "... but mercifully,"
she scribbled, ignoring the full stop, "everything seems satisfactorily
arranged, packed though we are like herrings in a barrel, and
forced to stand the perambulator which the landlady quite naturally
won't allow...."</p>

<p>Such were Betty Flanders's letters to Captain Barfoot&mdash;many-paged,
tear-stained. Scarborough is seven hundred miles from Cornwall:
Captain Barfoot is in Scarborough: Seabrook is dead. Tears made
all the dahlias in her garden undulate in red waves and flashed
the glass house in her eyes, and spangled the kitchen with bright
knives, and made Mrs. Jarvis, the rector's wife, think at church,
while the hymn-tune played and Mrs. Flanders bent low over her
little boys' heads, that marriage is a fortress and widows stray
solitary in the open fields, picking up stones, gleaning a few
golden straws, lonely, unprotected, poor creatures. Mrs. Flanders
had been a widow for these two years.</p>

<p>"Ja&mdash;cob! Ja&mdash;cob!" Archer shouted.</p>

<p>"Scarborough," Mrs. Flanders wrote on the envelope, and dashed
a bold line beneath; it was her native town; the hub of the universe.
But a stamp? She ferreted in her bag; then held it up mouth downwards;
then fumbled in her lap, all so vigorously that Charles Steele
in the Panama hat suspended his paint-brush.</p>

<p>Like the antennae of some irritable insect it positively trembled.
Here was that woman moving&mdash;actually going to get up&mdash;confound
her! He struck the canvas a hasty violet-black dab. For the landscape
needed it. It was too pale&mdash;greys flowing into lavenders, and
one star or a white gull suspended just so&mdash;too pale as usual.
The critics would say it was too pale, for he was an unknown man
exhibiting obscurely, a favourite with his landladies' children,
wearing a cross on his watch chain, and much gratified if his
landladies liked his pictures&mdash;which they often did.</p>

<p>"Ja&mdash;cob! Ja&mdash;cob!" Archer shouted.</p>

<p>Exasperated by the noise, yet loving children, Steele picked
nervously at the dark little coils on his palette.</p>

<p>"I saw your brother &mdash;I saw your brother," he said, nodding
his head, as Archer lagged past him, trailing his spade, and scowling
at the old gentleman in spectacles.</p>

<p>"Over there&mdash;by the rock," Steele muttered, with his brush between
his teeth, squeezing out raw sienna, and keeping his eyes fixed
on Betty Flanders's back.</p>

<p>"Ja&mdash;cob! Ja&mdash;cob!" shouted Archer, lagging on after a second.</p>

<p>The voice had an extraordinary sadness. Pure from all body, pure
from all passion, going out into the world, solitary, unanswered,
breaking against rocks&mdash;so it sounded.</p>

<p>Steele frowned; but was pleased by the effect of the black&mdash;it
was just <em>THAT </em>note which brought the rest together. "Ah,
one may learn to paint at fifty! There's Titian..." and so, having
found the right tint, up he looked and saw to his horror a cloud
over the bay.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanders rose, slapped her coat this side and that to get
the sand off, and picked up her black parasol.</p>

<p>The rock was one of those tremendously solid brown, or rather
black, rocks which emerge from the sand like something primitive.
Rough with crinkled limpet shells and sparsely strewn with locks
of dry seaweed, a small boy has to stretch his legs far apart,
and indeed to feel rather heroic, before he gets to the top.</p>

<p>But there, on the very top, is a hollow full of water, with a
sandy bottom; with a blob of jelly stuck to the side, and some
mussels. A fish darts across. The fringe of yellow-brown seaweed
flutters, and out pushes an opal-shelled crab&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, a huge crab," Jacob murmured&mdash;and begins his journey on
weakly legs on the sandy bottom. Now! Jacob plunged his hand.
The crab was cool and very light. But the water was thick with
sand, and so, scrambling down, Jacob was about to jump, holding
his bucket in front of him, when he saw, stretched entirely rigid,
side by side, their faces very red, an enormous man and woman.</p>

<p>An enormous man and woman (it was early-closing day) were stretched
motionless, with their heads on pocket-handkerchiefs, side by
side, within a few feet of the sea, while two or three gulls gracefully
skirted the incoming waves, and settled near their boots.</p>

<p>The large red faces lying on the bandanna handkerchiefs stared
up at Jacob. Jacob stared down at them. Holding his bucket very
carefully, Jacob then jumped deliberately and trotted away very
nonchalantly at first, but faster and faster as the waves came
creaming up to him and he had to swerve to avoid them, and the
gulls rose in front of him and floated out and settled again a
little farther on. A large black woman was sitting on the sand.
He ran towards her.</p>

<p>"Nanny! Nanny!" he cried, sobbing the words out on the crest
of each gasping breath.</p>

<p>The waves came round her. She was a rock. She was covered with
the seaweed which pops when it is pressed. He was lost.</p>

<p>There he stood. His face composed itself. He was about to roar
when, lying among the black sticks and straw under the cliff,
he saw a whole skull&mdash;perhaps a cow's skull, a skull, perhaps,
with the teeth in it. Sobbing, but absent-mindedly, he ran farther
and farther away until he held the skull in his arms.</p>

<p>"There he is!" cried Mrs. Flanders, coming round the rock and
covering the whole space of the beach in a few seconds. "What
has he got hold of? Put it down, Jacob! Drop it this moment! Something
horrid, I know. Why didn't you stay with us? Naughty little boy!
Now put it down. Now come along both of you," and she swept round,
holding Archer by one hand and fumbling for Jacob's arm with the
other. But he ducked down and picked up the sheep's jaw, which
was loose.</p>

<p>Swinging her bag, clutching her parasol, holding Archer's hand,
and telling the story of the gunpowder explosion in which poor
Mr. Curnow had lost his eye, Mrs. Flanders hurried up the steep
lane, aware all the time in the depths of her mind of some buried
discomfort.</p>

<p>There on the sand not far from the lovers lay the old sheep's
skull without its jaw. Clean, white, wind-swept, sand-rubbed,
a more unpolluted piece of bone existed nowhere on the coast of
Cornwall. The sea holly would grow through the eye-sockets; it
would turn to powder, or some golfer, hitting his ball one fine
day, would disperse a little dust &mdash;No, but not in lodgings,
thought Mrs. Flanders. It's a great experiment coming so far with
young children. There's no man to help with the perambulator.
And Jacob is such a handful; so obstinate already.</p>

<p>"Throw it away, dear, do," she said, as they got into the road;
but Jacob squirmed away from her; and the wind rising, she took
out her bonnet-pin, looked at the sea, and stuck it in afresh.
The wind was rising. The waves showed that uneasiness, like something
alive, restive, expecting the whip, of waves before a storm. The
fishing-boats were leaning to the water's brim. A pale yellow
light shot across the purple sea; and shut. The lighthouse was
lit. "Come along," said Betty Flanders. The sun blazed in their
faces and gilded the great blackberries trembling out from the
hedge which Archer tried to strip as they passed.</p>

<p>"Don't lag, boys. You've got nothing to change into," said Betty,
pulling them along, and looking with uneasy emotion at the earth
displayed so luridly, with sudden sparks of light from greenhouses
in gardens, with a sort of yellow and black mutability, against
this blazing sunset, this astonishing agitation and vitality of
colour, which stirred Betty Flanders and made her think of responsibility
and danger. She gripped Archer's hand. On she plodded up the hill.</p>

<p>"What did I ask you to remember?" she said.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Archer.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know either," said Betty, humorously and simply,
and who shall deny that this blankness of mind, when combined
with profusion, mother wit, old wives' tales, haphazard ways,
moments of astonishing daring, humour, and sentimentality&mdash;who
shall deny that in these respects every woman is nicer than any
man?</p>

<p>Well, Betty Flanders, to begin with.</p>

<p>She had her hand upon the garden gate.</p>

<p>"The meat!" she exclaimed, striking the latch down.</p>

<p>She had forgotten the meat.</p>

<p>There was Rebecca at the window.</p>

<p>The bareness of Mrs. Pearce's front room was fully displayed
at ten o'clock at night when a powerful oil lamp stood on the
middle of the table. The harsh light fell on the garden; cut straight
across the lawn; lit up a child's bucket and a purple aster and
reached the hedge. Mrs. Flanders had left her sewing on the table.
There were her large reels of white cotton and her steel spectacles;
her needle-case; her brown wool wound round an old postcard. There
were the bulrushes and the Strand magazines; and the linoleum
sandy from the boys' boots. A daddy-long-legs shot from corner
to corner and hit the lamp globe. The wind blew straight dashes
of rain across the window, which flashed silver as they passed
through the light. A single leaf tapped hurriedly, persistently,
upon the glass. There was a hurricane out at sea.</p>

<p>Archer could not sleep.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanders stooped over him. "Think of the fairies," said
Betty Flanders. "Think of the lovely, lovely birds settling down
on their nests. Now shut your eyes and see the old mother bird
with a worm in her beak. Now turn and shut your eyes," she murmured,
"and shut your eyes."</p>

<p>The lodging-house seemed full of gurgling and rushing; the cistern
overflowing; water bubbling and squeaking and running along the
pipes and streaming down the windows.</p>

<p>"What's all that water rushing in?" murmured Archer.</p>

<p>"It's only the bath water running away," said Mrs. Flanders.</p>

<p>Something snapped out of doors.</p>

<p>"I say, won't that steamer sink?" said Archer, opening his eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course it won't," said Mrs. Flanders. "The Captain's in bed
long ago. Shut your eyes, and think of the fairies, fast asleep,
under the flowers."</p>

<p>"I thought he'd never get off&mdash;such a hurricane," she whispered
to Rebecca, who was bending over a spirit-lamp in the small room
next door. The wind rushed outside, but the small flame of the
spirit-lamp burnt quietly, shaded from the cot by a book stood
on edge.</p>

<p>"Did he take his bottle well?" Mrs. Flanders whispered, and Rebecca
nodded and went to the cot and turned down the quilt, and Mrs.
Flanders bent over and looked anxiously at the baby, asleep, but
frowning. The window shook, and Rebecca stole like a cat and wedged
it.</p>

<p>The two women murmured over the spirit-lamp, plotting the eternal
conspiracy of hush and clean bottles while the wind raged and
gave a sudden wrench at the cheap fastenings.</p>

<p>Both looked round at the cot. Their lips were pursed. Mrs. Flanders
crossed over to the cot.</p>

<p>"Asleep?" whispered Rebecca, looking at the cot.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanders nodded.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Rebecca," Mrs. Flanders murmured, and Rebecca called
her ma'm, though they were conspirators plotting the eternal conspiracy
of hush and clean bottles.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanders had left the lamp burning in the front room. There
were her spectacles, her sewing; and a letter with the Scarborough
postmark. She had not drawn the curtains either.</p>

<p>The light blazed out across the patch of grass; fell on the child's
green bucket with the gold line round it, and upon the aster which
trembled violently beside it. For the wind was tearing across
the coast, hurling itself at the hills, and leaping, in sudden
gusts, on top of its own back. How it spread over the town in
the hollow! How the lights seemed to wink and quiver in its fury,
lights in the harbour, lights in bedroom windows high up! And
rolling dark waves before it, it raced over the Atlantic, jerking
the stars above the ships this way and that.</p>

<p>There was a click in the front sitting-room. Mr. Pearce had extinguished
the lamp. The garden went out. It was but a dark patch. Every
inch was rained upon. Every blade of grass was bent by rain. Eyelids
would have been fastened down by the rain. Lying on one's back
one would have seen nothing but muddle and confusion&mdash;clouds turning
and turning, and something yellow-tinted and sulphurous in the
darkness.</p>

<p>The little boys in the front bedroom had thrown off their blankets
and lay under the sheets. It was hot; rather sticky and steamy.
Archer lay spread out, with one arm striking across the pillow.
He was flushed; and when the heavy curtain blew out a little he
turned and half-opened his eyes. The wind actually stirred the
cloth on the chest of drawers, and let in a little light, so that
the sharp edge of the chest of drawers was visible, running straight
up, until a white shape bulged out; and a silver streak showed
in the looking-glass.</p>

<p>In the other bed by the door Jacob lay asleep, fast asleep, profoundly
unconscious. The sheep's jaw with the big yellow teeth in it lay
at his feet. He had kicked it against the iron bed-rail.</p>

<p>Outside the rain poured down more directly and powerfully as
the wind fell in the early hours of the morning. The aster was
beaten to the earth. The child's bucket was half-full of rainwater;
and the opal-shelled crab slowly circled round the bottom, trying
with its weakly legs to climb the steep side; trying again and
falling back, and trying again and again.</p>
