<p>Keredec was alone in his salon, extended at ease upon a long
chair, an ottoman and a stool, when I burst in upon him; a portentous
volume was in his lap, and a prolific pipe, smoking up from his
great cloud of beard, gave the final reality to the likeness he
thus presented of a range of hills ending in a volcano. But he
rolled the book cavalierly to the floor, limbered up by sections
to receive me, and offered me a hearty welcome.</p>

<p>"Ha, my dear sir," he cried, "you take pity on the lonely Keredec;
you make him a visit. I could not wish better for myself. We shall
have a good smoke and a good talk."</p>

<p>"You are improved to-day?" I asked, it may be a little slyly.</p>

<p>"Improve?" he repeated inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Your rheumatism, I mean."</p>

<p>"Ha, yes; that rheumatism!" he shouted, and throwing back his
head, rocked the room with sudden laughter. "Hew! But it is gone&mdash;almost!
Oh, I am much better, and soon I shall be able to go in the woods
again with my boy." He pushed a chair toward me. "Come, light
your cigar; he will not return for an hour perhaps, and there
is plenty of time for the smoke to blow away. So! It is better.
Now we shall talk."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I wanted to talk with you."</p>

<p>"That is a&mdash;what you call?&mdash;ha, yes, a coincidence," he returned,
stretching himself again in the long chair, "a happy coincidence;
for I have wished a talk with you; but you are away so early for
all day, and in the evening Oliver, he is always here."</p>

<p>"I think what I wanted to talk about concerns him particularly."</p>

<p>"Yes?" The professor leaned forward, looking at me gravely. "That
is another coincidence. But you shall speak first. Commence then."</p>

<p>"I feel that you know me at least well enough," I began rather
hesitatingly, "to be sure that I would not, for the world, make
any effort to intrude in your affairs, or Mr. Saffren's, and that
I would not force your confidence in the remotest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" he interrupted. "Please do not fear I shall misinterpretate
whatever you will say. You are our friend. We know it."</p>

<p>"Very well," I pursued; "then I speak with no fear of offending.
When you first came to the inn I couldn't help seeing that you
took a great many precautions for secrecy; and when you afterward
explained these precautions to me on the ground that you feared
somebody might think Mr. Saffren not quite sane, and that such
an impression might injure him later&mdash;well, I could not help seeing
that your explanation did not cover all the ground."</p>

<p>"It is true&mdash;it did not." He ran his huge hand through the heavy
white waves of his hair, and shook his head vigorously. "No; I
knew it, my dear sir, I knew it well. But, what could I do? I
would not have telled my own mother! This much I can say to you:
we came here at a risk, but I thought that with great care it
might be made little. And I thought a great good thing might be
accomplish if we should come here, something so fine, so wonderful,
that even if the danger had been great I would have risked it.
I will tell you a little more: I think that great thing is <em>BEING
</em>accomplish!" Here he rose to his feet excitedly and began
to pace the room as he talked, the ancient floor shaking with
his tread. "I think it is <em>DONE! </em>And ha! my dear sir,
if it <em>SHOULD </em>be, this big Keredec will not have lived
in vain! It was a great task I undertake with my young man, and
the glory to see it finish is almost here. Even if the danger
should come, the <em>THING </em>is done, for all that is real
and has true meaning is inside the soul!"</p>

<p>"It was in connection with the risk you have mentioned that I
came to talk," I returned with some emphasis, for I was convinced
of the reality of Mr. Earl Percy and also very certain that he
had no existence inside or outside a soul. "I think it necessary
that you should know&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the professor was launched. I might as well have swept the
rising tide with a broom. He talked with magnificent vehemence
for twenty minutes, his theme being some theory of his own that
the individuality of a soul is immortal, and that even in perfection,
the soul cannot possibly merge into any Nirvana. Meantime, I wondered
how Mr. Percy was employing his time, but after one or two ineffectual
attempts to interrupt, I gave myself to silence until the oration
should be concluded.</p>

<p>"And so it is with my boy," he proclaimed, coming at last to
the case in hand. "The spirit of him, the real Oliver Saffren,
<em>THAT </em>has <em>NEVER </em>change! The outside of him, those
thing that <em>BELONG </em>to him, like his memory, <em>THEY </em>have
change, but not himself, for himself is eternal and unchangeable.
I have taught him, yes; I have helped him get the small things
we can add to our possession&mdash;a little knowledge, maybe, a little
power of judgment. But, my dear sir, I tell you that such things
are <em>ONLY </em>possessions of a man. They are not the <em>MAN!
</em>All that a man IS or ever shall be, he is when he is a baby.
So with Oliver; he had lived a little while, twenty-six years,
perhaps, when pft&mdash;like that!&mdash;he became almost as a baby again.
He could remember how to talk, but not much more. He had lost
his belongings&mdash;they were gone from the lobe of the brain where
he had stored them; but HE was not gone, no part of the real <em>HIMSELF
</em>was lacking. Then presently they send him to me to make new
his belongings, to restore his possessions. Ha, what a task! To
take him with nothing in the world of his own and see that he
get only <em>GOOD </em>possessions, <em>GOOD </em>knowledge, <em>GOOD
</em>experience! I took him to the mountains of the Tyrol&mdash;two
years&mdash;and there his body became strong and splendid while his
brain was taking in the stores. It was quick, for his brain had
retained some habits; it was not a baby's brain, and some small
part of its old stores had not been lost. But if anything useless
or bad remain, we empty it out &mdash;I and those mountain' with
their pure air. Now, I say he is all good and the work was good;
I am proud! But I wish to restore <em>ALL </em>that was good in
his life; your Keredec is something of a poet. &mdash;You may
put it: much the old fool! And for that greates' restoration of
all I have brought my boy back to France; since it was necessary.
It was a madness, and I thank the good God I was mad enough to
do it. I cannot tell you yet, my dear sir: but you shall see,
you shall see what the folly of that old Keredec has done! You
shall see, you shall&mdash;and I promise it&mdash;what a Paradise, when
the good God helps, an old fool's dream can make!"</p>

<p>A half-light had broken upon me as he talked, pacing the floor,
thundering his paean of triumph, his Titanic gestures bruising
the harmless air. Only one explanation, incredible, but possible,
sufficed. Anything was possible, I thought&mdash;anything was probable&mdash;with
this dreamer whom the trump of Fame, executing a whimsical fantasia,
proclaimed a man of science!</p>

<p>"By the wildest chance," I gasped, "you don't mean that you wanted
him to fall in love&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had reached the other end of the room, but at this he whirled
about on me, his laughter rolling out again, till it might have
been heard at Pere Baudry's.</p>

<p>"Ha, my dear sir, you have said it! But you knew it; you told
him to come to me and tell me."</p>

<p>"But I mean that you&mdash;unless I utterly misunderstand&mdash;you seem
to imply that you had selected some one now in France whom you
planned that he should care for&mdash;that you had selected the lady
whom you know as Madame d'Armand."</p>

<p>"Again," he shouted, "you have said it!"</p>

<p>"Professor Keredec," I returned, with asperity, "I have no idea
how you came to conceive such a preposterous scheme, but I agree
heartily that the word for it is madness. In the first place,
I must tell you that her name is not even d'Armand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, I know. It was the mistake of that absurd Amedee.
She is Mrs. Harman."</p>

<p>"You knew it?" I cried, hopelessly confused. "But Oliver still
speaks of her as Madame d'Armand."</p>

<p>"He does not know. She has not told him."</p>

<p>"But why haven't you told him?"</p>

<p>"Ha, that is a story, a poem," he cried, beginning to pace the
floor again&mdash;"a ballad as old as the oldest of Provence! There
is a reason, my dear sir, which I cannot tell you, but it lies
within the romance of what you agree is my madness. Some day,
I hope, you shall understand and applaud! In the meantime&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the meantime," I said sharply, as he paused for breath, "there
is a keen-faced young man who took a room in the inn this morning
and who has come to spy upon you, I believe."</p>

<p>"What is it you say?"</p>

<p>He came to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>I had not meant to deliver my information quite so abruptly,
but there was no help for it now, and I repeated the statement,
giving him a terse account of my two encounters with the rattish
youth, and adding:</p>

<p>"He seemed to be certain that 'Oliver Saffren' is an assumed
name, and he made a threatening reference to the laws of France."</p>

<p>The effect upon Keredec was a very distinct pallor. He faced
me silently until I had finished, then in a voice grown suddenly
husky, asked:</p>

<p>"Do you think he came back to the inn? Is he here now?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"We must learn; I must know that, at once." And he went to the
door.</p>

<p>"Let me go instead," I suggested.</p>

<p>"It can't make little difference if he see me," said the professor,
swallowing with difficulty and displaying, as he turned to me,
a look of such profound anxiety that I was as sorry for him now
as I had been irritated a few minutes earlier by his galliard
air-castles. "I do not know this man, nor does he know me, but
I have fear"&mdash;his beard moved as though his chin were trembling&mdash;"I
have fear that I know his employers. Still, it may be better if
you go. Bring somebody here that we can ask."</p>

<p>"Shall I find Amedee?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no! That babbler? Find Madame Brossard."</p>

<p>I stepped out to the gallery, to discover Madame Brossard emerging
from a door on the opposite side of the courtyard; Amedee, Glouglou,
and a couple of carters deploying before her with some light trunks
and bags, which they were carrying into the passage she had just
quitted. I summoned her quietly; she came briskly up the steps
and into the room, and I closed the door.</p>

<p>"Madame Brossard," said the professor, "you have a new client
to-day."</p>

<p>"That monsieur who arrived this morning," I suggested.</p>

<p>"He was an American," said the hostess, knitting her dark brows&mdash;"but
I do not think that he was exactly a monsieur."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" I murmured. "That sketches a likeness. It is this 'Percy'
without a doubt."</p>

<p>"That is it," she returned. "Monsieur Poissy is the name he gave."</p>

<p>"Is he at the inn now?"</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, but two friends for whom he engaged apartments
have just arrived."</p>

<p>"Who are they?" asked Keredec quickly.</p>

<p>"It is a lady and a monsieur from Paris. But not married: they
have taken separate apartments and she has a domestic with her,
a negress, Algerian."</p>

<p>"What are their names?"</p>

<p>"It is not ten minutes that they are installed. They have not
given me their names."</p>

<p>"What is the lady's appearance?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur the Professor," replied the hostess demurely, "she
is not beautiful."</p>

<p>"But what is she?" demanded Keredec impatiently; and it could
be seen that he was striving to control a rising agitation. "Is
she blonde? Is she brunette? Is she young? Is she old? Is she
French, English, Spanish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think," said Madame Brossard, "I think one would call her
Spanish, but she is very fat, not young, and with a great deal
too much rouge&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped with an audible intake of breath, staring at my friend's
white face. "Eh! it is bad news?" she cried. "And when one has
been so ill&mdash;"</p>

<p>Keredec checked her with an imperious gesture. "Monsieur Saffren
and I leave at once," he said. "I shall meet him on the road;
he will not return to the inn. We go to&mdash;to Trouville. See that
no one knows that we have gone until to-morrow, if possible; I
shall leave fees for the servants with you. Go now, prepare your
bill, and bring it to me at once. I shall write you where to send
our trunks. Quick! And you, my friend"&mdash;he turned to me as Madame
Brossard, obviously distressed and frightened, but none the less
intelligent for that, skurried away to do his bidding&mdash;"my friend,
will you help us? For we need it!"</p>

<p>"Anything in the world!"</p>

<p>"Go to Pere Baudry's; have him put the least tired of his three
horses to his lightest cart and wait in the road beyond the cottage.
Stand in the road yourself while that is being done. Oliver will
come that way; detain him. I will join you there; I have only
to see to my papers&mdash;at the most, twenty minutes. Go quickly,
my friend!"</p>

<p>I strode to the door and out to the gallery. I was half-way down
the steps before I saw that Oliver Saffren was already in the
courtyard, coming toward me from the archway with a light and
buoyant step.</p>

<p>He looked up, waving his hat to me, his face lighted with a happiness
most remarkable, and brighter, even, than the strong, midsummer
sunshine flaming over him. Dressed in white as he was, and with
the air of victory he wore, he might have been, at that moment,
a figure from some marble triumph; youthful, conquering&mdash;crowned
with the laurel.</p>

<p>I had time only to glance at him, to "take" him, as it were,
between two shutter-flicks of the instantaneous eyelid, and with
him, the courtyard flooded with sunshine, the figure of Madame
Brossard emerging from her little office, Amedee coming from the
kitchen bearing a white-covered tray, and, entering from the road,
upon the trail of Saffren but still in the shadow of the archway,
the discordant fineries and hatchet-face of the ex-pedestrian
and tourist, my antagonist of the forest.</p>

<p>I had opened my mouth to call a warning.</p>

<p>"Hurry" was the word I would have said, but it stopped at "hur&mdash;."
The second syllable was never uttered.</p>

<p>There came a violent outcry, raucous and shrill as the wail of
a captured hen, and out of the passage across the courtyard floundered
a woman, fantastically dressed in green and gold.</p>

<p>Her coarse blue-black hair fell dishevelled upon her shoulders,
from which her gown hung precariously unfastened, as if she had
abandoned her toilet half-way. She was abundantly fat, double-chinned,
coarse, greasy, smeared with blue pencillings, carmine, enamel,
and rouge.</p>

<p>At the scream Saffren turned. She made straight at him, crying
wildly:</p>

<p>"Enfin! Mon mari, mon mari&mdash;c'est moi! C'est ta femme, mon coeur!"</p>

<p>She threw herself upon him, her arms about his neck, with a tropical
ferocity that was a very paroxysm of triumph.</p>

<p>"Embrasse moi, Larrabi! Embrasse moi!" she cried.</p>

<p>Horrified, outraged, his eyes blazing, he flung her off with
a violence surpassing her own, and with loathing unspeakable.
She screamed that he was killing her, calling him "husband," and
tried to fasten herself upon him again. But he leaped backward
beyond the reach of her clutching hands, and, turning, plunged
to the steps and staggered up them, the woman following.</p>

<p>From above me leaned the stricken face of Keredec; he caught
Saffren under the arm and half lifted him to the gallery, while
she strove to hold him by the knees.</p>

<p>"O Christ!" gasped Saffren. "Is <em>THIS </em>the woman?"</p>

<p>The giant swung him across the gallery and into the open door
with one great sweep of the arm, strode in after him, and closed
and bolted the door. The woman fell in a heap at the foot of the
steps, uttered a cracked simulation of the cry of a broken heart.</p>

<p>"Name of a name of God!" she wailed. "After all these years!
And my husband strikes me!"</p>

<p>Then it was that what had been in my mind as a monstrous suspicion
became a certainty. For I recognised the woman; she was Mariana&mdash;la
bella Mariana la Mursiana.</p>

<p>If I had ever known Larrabee Harman, if, instead of the two strange
glimpses I had caught of him, I had been familiar with his gesture,
walk, intonation&mdash;even, perhaps, if I had ever heard his voice&mdash;the
truth might have come to me long ago.</p>

<p>Larrabee Harman!</p>

<p>"Oliver Saffren" was Larrabee Harman.</p>
