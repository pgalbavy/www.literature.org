<p>ON May 26th, the caravan of slaves arrived at Kazounde. Fifty per
cent. of the prisoners taken in the last raid had fallen on the road.
Meanwhile, the business was still good for the traders; demands were
coming in, and the price of slaves was about to rise in the African
markets.</p>

<p>Angola at this period did an immense trade in blacks. The Portuguese
authorities of St. Paul de Loanda, or of Benguela, could not stop it
without difficulty, for the convoys traveled towards the interior
of the African continent. The pens near the coast overflowed with
prisoners, the few slavers that succeeded in eluding the cruisers
along the shore not being sufficient to carry all of them to the
Spanish colonies of America.</p>

<p>Kazounde, situated three hundred miles from the mouth of the Coanza,
is one of the principal &quot;lakonis,&quot; one of the most important markets
of the province. On its grand square the &quot;tchitoka&quot; business is
transacted; there, the slaves are exposed and sold. It is from this
point that the caravans radiate toward the region of the great lakes.</p>

<p>Kazounde, like all the large towns of Central Africa, is divided into
two distinct parts. One is the quarter of the Arab, Portuguese or
native traders, and it contains their pens; the other is the residence
of the negro king, some ferocious crowned drunkard, who reigns through
terror, and lives from supplies furnished by the contractors.</p>

<p>At Kazounde, the commercial quarter then belonged to that Jose-Antonio
Alvez, of whom Harris and Negoro had spoken, they being simply agents
in his pay. This contractor's principal establishment was there, he
had a second at Bihe, and a third at Cassange, in Benguela, which
Lieutenant Cameron visited some years later.</p>

<p>Imagine a large central street, on each side groups of houses,
&quot;tembes,&quot; with flat roofs, walls of baked earth, and a square court
which served as an enclosure for cattle. At the end of the street was
the vast &quot;tchitoka&quot; surrounded by slave-pens. Above this collection
of buildings rose some enormous banyans, whose branches swayed with
graceful movements. Here and there great palms, with their heads in
the air, drove the dust on the streets like brooms. Twenty birds of
prey watched over the public health. Such is the business quarter of
Kazounde.</p>

<p>Near by ran the Louhi, a river whose course, still undetermined, is an
affluent, or at least a sub-affluent, of the Coango, a tributary of
the Zoire.</p>

<p>The residence of the King of Kazounde, which borders on the business
quarter, is a confused collection of ill-built hovels, which spread
over the space of a mile square. Of these hovels, some are open,
others are inclosed by a palisade of reeds, or bordered with a hedge
of fig-trees. In one particular enclosure, surrounded by a fence of
papyrus, thirty of these huts served us dwellings for the chief's
slaves, in another group lived his wives, and a &quot;tembe,&quot; still larger
and higher, was half hidden in a plantation of cassada. Such was
the residence of the King of Kazounde, a man of fifty - named Moini
Loungga; and already almost deprived of the power of his predecessors.
He had not four thousand of soldiers there, where the principal
Portuguese traders could count twenty thousand, and he could no
longer, as in former times, decree the sacrifice of twenty-five or
thirty slaves a day.</p>

<p>This king was, besides, a prematurely-aged man, exhausted by debauch,
crazed by strong drink, a ferocious maniac, mutilating his subjects,
his officers or his ministers, as the whim seized him, cutting the
nose and ears off some, and the foot or the hand from others. His own
death, not unlooked for, would be received without regret.</p>

<p>A single man in all Kazounde might, perhaps, lose by the death of
Moini Loungga. This was the contractor, Jose-Antonio Alvez, who agreed
very well with the drunkard, whose authority was recognized by the
whole province. If the accession of his first wife, Queen Moini,
should be contested, the States of Moini Loungga might be invaded by
a neighboring competitor, one of the kings of Oukonson. The latter,
being younger and more active, had already seized some villages
belonging to the Kazounde government. He had in his services another
trader, a rival of Alvez Tipo-Tipo, a black Arab of a pure race, whom
Cameron met at N'yangwe.</p>

<p>What was this Alvez, the real sovereign under the reign of an imbruted
negro, whose vices he had developed and served?</p>

<p>Jose-Antonio Alvez, already advanced in years, was not, as one might
suppose, a &quot;msoungou,&quot; that is to say, a man of the white race. There
was nothing Portuguese about him but his name, borrowed, no doubt, for
the needs of commerce. He was a real negro, well known among traders,
and called Kenndele. He was born, in fact, at Donndo, or the borders
of the Coanza. He had commenced by being simply the agent of the
slave-brokers, and would have finished as a famous trader, that is to
say, in the skin of an old knave, who called himself the most honest
man in the world.</p>

<p>Cameron met this Alvez in the latter part of 1874, at Kilemmba, the
capital of Kassonngo, chief of Ouroua. He guided Cameron with his
caravan to his own establishment at Bihe, over a route of seven
hundred miles. The convoy of slaves, on arriving at Kazounde, had been
conducted to the large square.</p>

<p>It was the 26th of May. Dick Sand's calculations were then verified.
The journey had lasted thirty-eight days from the departure of the
army encamped on the banks of the Coanza. Five weeks of the most
fearful miseries that human beings could support.</p>

<p>It was noon when the train entered Kazounde. The drums were beaten,
horns were blown in the midst of the detonations of fire-arms. The
soldiers guarding the caravan discharged their guns in the air, and
the men employed by Jose-Antonio Alvez replied with interest. All
these bandits were happy at meeting again, after an absence which had
lasted for four months. They were now going to rest and make up for
lost time in excesses and idleness.</p>

<p>The prisoners then formed a total of two hundred and fifty, the
majority being completely exhausted. After having been driven like
cattle, they were to be shut up in pens, which American farmers would
not have used for pigs. Twelve or fifteen hundred other captives
awaited them, all of whom would be exposed in the market at Kazounde
on the next day but one. These pens were filled up with the slaves
from the caravan. The heavy forks had been taken off them, but they
were still in chains.</p>

<p>The &quot;pagazis&quot; had stopped on the square after having disposed of their
loads of ivory, which the Kazounde dealers would deliver. Then, being
paid with a few yards of calico or other stuff at the highest price,
they would return and join some other caravan.</p>

<p>Old Tom and his companions had been freed from the iron collar which
they had carried for five weeks. Bat and his father embraced each
other, and all shook hands; but no one ventured to speak. What could
they say that would not be an expression of despair. Bat, Acteon and
Austin, all three vigorous, accustomed to hard work, had been able
to resist fatigue; but old Tom, weakened by privations, was nearly
exhausted. A few more days and his corpse would have been left, like
poor Nan's, as food for the beasts of the province.</p>

<p>As soon as they arrived, the four men had been placed in a narrow pen,
and the door had been at once shut upon them. There they had found
some food, and they awaited the trader's visit, with whom, although
quite in vain, they intended to urge the fact that they were
Americans.</p>

<p>Dick Sand had remained alone on the square, under the special care of
a keeper.</p>

<p>At length he was at Kazounde, where he did not doubt that Mrs. Weldon,
little Jack, and Cousin Benedict had preceded him. He had looked for
them in crossing the various quarters of the town, even in the depths
of the &quot;tembes&quot; that lined the streets, on this &quot;tchitoka&quot; now almost
deserted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Weldon was not there.</p>

<p>&quot;Have they not brought her here?&quot; he asked himself. &quot;But where could
she be? No; Hercules cannot be mistaken. Then, again, he must have
learned the secret designs of Negoro and Harris; yet they, too - I do
not see them.&quot;</p>

<p>Dick Sand felt the most painful anxiety. He could understand that Mrs.
Weldon, retained a prisoner, would be concealed from him. But Harris
and Negoro, particularly the latter, should hasten to see him, now in
their power, if only to enjoy their triumph - to insult him, torture
him, perhaps avenge themselves. From the fact that they were not
there, must he conclude that they had taken another direction, and
that Mrs. Weldon was to be conducted to some other point of Central
Africa? Should the presence of the American and the Portuguese be the
signal for his punishment, Dick Sand impatiently desired it. Harris
and Negoro at Kazounde, was for him the certainty that Mrs. Weldon and
her child were also there.</p>

<p>Dick Sand then told himself that, since the night when Dingo had
brought him Hercules's note, the dog had not been seen. The young man
had prepared an answer at great risks. In it he told Hercules to
think only of Mrs. Weldon, not to lose sight of her, and to keep her
informed as well as possible of what happened; but he had not been
able to send it to its destination. If Dingo had been able to
penetrate the ranks of the caravan once, why did not Hercules let
him try it a second time? Had the faithful animal perished in some
fruitless attempt? Perhaps Hercules was following Mrs. Weldon, as Dick
Sand would have done in his place. Followed by Dingo, he might have
plunged into the depths of the woody plateau of Africa, in the hope of
reaching one of the interior establishments.</p>

<p>What could Dick Sand imagine if, in fact, neither Mrs. Weldon nor her
enemies were there? He had been so sure, perhaps foolishly, of finding
them at Kazounde, that not to see them there at once gave him a
terrible shock. He felt a sensation of despair that he could not
subdue. His life, if it were no longer useful to those whom he loved,
was good for nothing, and he had only to die. But, in thinking in that
manner, Dick Sand mistook his own character. Under the pressure of
these trials, the child became a man, and with him discouragement
could only be an accidental tribute paid to human nature.</p>

<p>A loud concert of trumpet-calls and cries suddenly commenced. Dick
Sand, who had just sunk down in the dust of the &quot;tchitoka,&quot; stood up.
Every new incident might put him on the track of those whom he sought.</p>

<p>In despair a moment before, he now no longer despaired.</p>

<p>&quot;Alvez! Alvez!&quot; This name was repeated by a crowd of natives and
soldiers who now invaded the grand square. The man on whom the fate
of so many unfortunate people depended was about to appear. It was
possible that his agents, Harris and Negoro, were with him. Dick Sand
stood upright, his eyes open, his nostrils dilated. The two traitors
would find this lad of fifteen years before them, upright, firm,
looking them in the face. It would not be the captain of the &quot;Pilgrim&quot;
who would tremble before the old ship's cook.</p>

<p>A hammock, a kind of &quot;kitanda&quot; covered by an old patched curtain,
discolored, fringed with rags, appeared at the end of the principal
street. An old negro descended. It was the trader, Jose-Antonio Alvez.
Several attendants accompanied him, making strong demonstrations.</p>

<p>Along with Alvez appeared his friend Coimbra, the son of Major Coimbra
of Bihe, and, according to Lieutenant Cameron, the greatest scamp in
the province. He was a dirty creature, his breast was uncovered, his
eyes were bloodshot, his hair was rough and curly, his face yellow;
he was dressed in a ragged shirt and a straw petticoat. He would have
been called a horrible old man in his tattered straw hat. This Coimbra
was the confidant, the tool of Alvez, an organizer of raids, worthy of
commanding the trader's bandits.</p>

<p>As for the trader, he might have looked a little less sordid than his
attendant. He wore the dress of an old Turk the day after a carnival.
He did not furnish a very high specimen of the factory chiefs who
carry on the trade on a large scale.</p>

<p>To Dick Sand's great disappointment, neither Harris nor Negoro
appeared in the crowd that followed Alvez. Must he, then, renounce all
hope of finding them at Kazounde?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the chief of the caravan, the Arab, Ibn Hamis, shook hands
with Alvez and Coimbra. He received numerous congratulations. Alvez
made a grimace at the fifty per cent. of slaves failing in the general
count, but, on the whole, the affair was very satisfactory. With
what the trader possessed of human merchandise in his pens, he could
satisfy the demands from the interior, and barter slaves for ivory
teeth and those &quot;hannas&quot; of copper, a kind of St. Andrew's cross, in
which form this metal is carried into the center of Africa.</p>

<p>The overseers were also complimented. As for the porters, the trader
gave orders that their salary should be immediately paid them.</p>

<p>Jose-Antonio Alvez and Coimbra spoke a kind of Portuguese mingled
with a native idiom, which a native of Lisbon would scarcely have
understood. Dick Sand could not hear what these merchants were saying.
Were they talking of him and his companions, so treacherously joined
to the persons in the convoy? The young man could not doubt it, when,
at a gesture from the Arab, Ibn Hamis, an overseer, went toward the
pen where Tom, Austin, Bat and Acteon had been shut up.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the four Americans were led before Alvez.</p>

<p>Dick Sand slowly approached. He wished to lose nothing of this scene.</p>

<p>Alvez's face lit up at the sight of these few well-made blacks, to
whom rest and more abundant food had promptly restored their natural
vigor. He looked with contempt at old Tom, whose age would affect his
value, but the other three would sell high at the next Kazounde sale.</p>

<p>Alvez remembered a few English words which some agents, like the
American, Harris, had taught him, and the old monkey thought he would
ironically welcome his new slaves.</p>

<p>Tom understood the trader's words; he at once advanced, and, showing
his companions, said:</p>

<p>&quot;We are free men - citizens of the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>Alvez certainly understood him; he replied with a good-humored
grimace, wagging his head:</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, Americans! Welcome, welcome!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome,&quot; added Coimbra.</p>

<p>He advanced toward Austin, and like a merchant who examines a sample,
after having felt his chest and his shoulders, he wanted to make him
open his mouth, so as to see his teeth.</p>

<p>But at this moment Signor Coimbra received in his face the worst blow
that a major's son had ever caught.</p>

<p>Alvez's confidant staggered under it.</p>

<p>Several soldiers threw themselves on Austin, who would perhaps pay
dearly for this angry action.</p>

<p>Alvez stopped them by a look. He laughed, indeed, at the misfortune
of his friend, Coimbra, who had lost two of the five or six teeth
remaining to him.</p>

<p>Alvez did not intend to have his merchandise injured. Then, he was of
a gay disposition, and it was a long time since he had laughed so
much.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he consoled the much discomfited Coimbra, and the latter,
helped to his feet, again took his place near the trader, while
throwing a menacing look at the audacious Austin.</p>

<p>At this moment Dick Sand, driven forward by an overseer, was led
before Alvez.</p>

<p>The latter evidently knew all about the young man, whence he came, and
how he had been taken to the camp on the Coanza.</p>

<p>So he said, after having given him an evil glance:</p>

<p>&quot;The little Yankee!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Yankee!&quot; replied Dick Sand. &quot;What do they wish to do with my
companions and me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yankee! Yankee! Yankee!&quot; repeated Alvez.</p>

<p>Did he not or would he not understand the question put to him?</p>

<p>A second time Dick Sand asked the question regarding his companions
and himself. He then turned to Coimbra, whose features, degraded as
they were by the abuse of alcoholic liquors, he saw were not of native
origin.</p>

<p>Coimbra repeated the menacing gesture already made at Austin, and did
not answer.</p>

<p>During this time Alvez talked rapidly with the Arab, Ibn Hamis, and
evidently of things that concerned Dick Sand and his friends.</p>

<p>No doubt they were to be again separated, and who could tell if
another chance to exchange a few words would ever again be offered
them.</p>

<p>&quot;My friends,&quot; said Dick, in a low voice, and as if he were only
speaking to himself, &quot;just a few words! I have received, by Dingo, a
letter from Hercules. He has followed the caravan. Harris and Negoro
took away Mrs. Weldon, Jack, and Mr. Benedict. Where? I know not, if
they are not here at Kazounde. Patience! courage! Be ready at any
moment. God may yet have pity on us!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Nan?&quot; quickly asked old Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Nan is dead!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The first!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the last!&quot; replied Dick Sand, &quot;for we know well -  - &quot;</p>

<p>At this moment a hand was laid on his shoulder, and he heard these
words, spoken in the amiable voice which he knew only too well:</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, my young friend, if I am not mistaken! Enchanted to see you
again!&quot;</p>

<p>Dick Sand turned.</p>

<p>Harris was before him.</p>

<p>&quot;Where is Mrs. Weldon?&quot; cried Dick Sand, walking toward the American.</p>

<p>&quot;Alas!&quot; replied Harris, pretending a pity that he did not feel, &quot;the
poor mother! How could she survive!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dead!&quot; cried Dick Sand. &quot;And her child?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The poor baby!&quot; replied Harris, in the same tone, &quot;how could he
outlive such fatigue!&quot;</p>

<p>So, all whom Dick Sand loved were dead!</p>

<p>What passed within him? An irresistible movement of anger, a desire
for vengeance, which he must satisfy at any price!</p>

<p>Dick Sand jumped upon Harris, seized a dagger from the American's
belt, and plunged it into his heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Curse you!&quot; cried Harris, falling.</p>

<p>Harris was dead.</p>
