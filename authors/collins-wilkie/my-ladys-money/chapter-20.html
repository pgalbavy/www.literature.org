<P>
THE day of the garden party arrived. There was no rain; but the
air was heavy, and the sky was overcast by lowering clouds.
<P>
Some hours before the guests were expected, Isabel arrived alone
at the farm, bearing the apologies of unfortunate Miss Pink,
still kept a prisoner in her bed-chamber by the asthma. In the
confusion produced at the cottage by the preparations for
entertaining the company, the one room in which Hardyman could
receive Isabel with the certainty of not being interrupted was
the smoking-room. To this haven of refuge he led her--still
reserved and silent, still not restored to her customary spirits.
"If any visitors come before the time," Hardyman said to his
servant, "tell them I am engaged at the stables. I must have an
hour's quiet talk with you," he continued, turning to Isabel, "or
I shall be in too bad a temper to receive my guests with common
politeness. The worry of giving this party is not to be told in
words. I almost wish I had been content with presenting you to my
mother, and had let the rest of my acquaintances go to the
devil."
<P>
A quiet half hour passed; and the first visitor, a stranger to
the servants, appeared at the cottage-gate. He was a middle-aged
man, and he had no wish to disturb Mr. Hardyman. "I will wait in
the grounds," he said, "and trouble nobody." The middle-aged man,
who expressed himself in these modest terms, was Robert Moody.
<P>
Five minutes later, a carriage drove up to the gate. An elderly
lady got out of it, followed by a fat white Scotch terrier, who
growled at every stranger within his reach. It is needless to
introduce Lady Lydiard and Tommie.
<P>
Informed that Mr. Hardyman was at the stables, Lady Lydiard gave
the servant her card. "Take that to your master, and say I won't
detain him five minutes." With these words, her Ladyship
sauntered into the grounds. She looked about her with observant
eyes; not only noticing the tent which had been set up on the
grass to accommodate the expected guests, but entering it, and
looking at the waiters who were engaged in placing the luncheon
on the table. Returning to the outer world, she next remarked
that Mr. Hardyman's lawn was in very bad order. Barren sun-dried
patches, and little holes and crevices opened here and there by
the action of the summer heat, announced that the lawn, like
everything else at the farm, had been neglected, in the exclusive
attention paid to the claims of the horses. Reaching a shrubbery
which bounded one side of the grounds next, her Ladyship became
aware of a man slowly approaching her, to all appearance absorbed
in thought. The man drew a little nearer. She lifted her glasses
to her eyes and recognized--Moody.
<P>
No embarrassment was produced on either side by this unexpected
meeting. Lady Lydiard had, not long since, sent to ask her former
steward to visit her; regretting, in her warm-hearted way, the
terms on which they had separated, and wishing to atone for the
harsh language that had escaped her at their parting interview.
In the friendly talk which followed the reconciliation, Lady
Lydiard not only heard the news of Moody's pecuniary
inheritance--but, noticing the change in his appearance for the
worse, contrived to extract from him the confession of his
ill-starred passion for Isabel. To discover him now, after all
that he had acknowledged, walking about the grounds at Hardyman's
farm, took her Ladyship completely by surprise. "Good Heavens!"
she exclaimed, in her loudest tones, "what are you doing here?"
<P>
"You mentioned Mr. Hardyman's garden party, my Lady, when I had
the honor of waiting on you," Moody answered. "Thinking over it
afterward, it seemed the fittest occasion I could find for making
a little wedding present to Miss Isabel. Is there any harm in my
asking Mr. Hardyman to let me put the present on her plate, so
that she may see it when she sits down to luncheon? If your
Ladyship thinks so, I will go away directly, and send the gift by
post."
<P>
Lady Lydiard looked at him attentively. "You don't despise the
girl," she asked, "for selling herself for rank and money? I
do--I can tell you!"
<P>
Moody's worn white face flushed a little. "No, my Lady," he
answered, "I can't hear you say that! Isabel would not have
engaged herself to Mr. Hardyman unless she had been fond of
him--as fond, I dare say, as I once hoped she might be of me.
It's a hard thing to confess that; but I do confess it, in
justice to her--God bless her!"
<P>
The generosity that spoke in those simple words touched the
finest sympathies in Lady Lydiard's nature. "Give me your hand,"
she said, with her own generous spirit kindling in her eyes. "You
have a great heart, Moody. Isabel Miller is a fool for not
marrying _you_--and one day she will know it!"
<P>
Before a word more could pass between them, Hardyman's voice was
audible on the other side of the shrubbery, calling irritably to
his servant to find Lady Lydiard.
<P>
Moody retired to the further end of the walk, while Lady Lydiard
advanced in the opposite direction, so as to meet Hardyman at the
entrance to the shrubbery. He bowed stiffly, and begged to know
why her Ladyship had honored him with a visit.
<P>
Lady Lydiard replied without noticing the coldness of her
reception.
<P>
"I have not been very well, Mr. Hardyman, or you would have seen
me before this. My only object in presenting myself here is to
make my excuses personally for having written of you in terms
which expressed a doubt of your honor. I have done you an
injustice, and I beg you to forgive me."
<P>
Hardyman acknowledged this frank apology as unreservedly as it
had been offered to him. "Say no more, Lady Lydiard. And let me
hope, now you are here, that you will honor my little party with
your presence."
<P>
Lady Lydiard gravely stated her reasons for not accepting the
invitation.
<P>
"I disapprove so strongly of unequal marriages," she said,
walking on slowly towards the cottage, "that I cannot, in common
consistency, become one of your guests. I shall always feel
interested in Isabel Miller's welfare; and I can honestly say I
shall be glad if your married life proves that my old-fashioned
prejudices are without justification in your case. Accept my
thanks for your invitation; and let me hope that my plain
speaking has not offended you."
<P>
She bowed, and looked about her for Tommie before she advanced to
the carriage waiting for her at the gate. In the surprise of
seeing Moody she had forgotten to look back for the dog when she
entered the shrubbery. She now called to him, and blew the
whistle at her watchchain. Not a sign of Tommie was to be seen.
Hardyman instantly directed the servants to search in the cottage
and out of the cottage for the dog. The order was obeyed with all
needful activity and intelligence, and entirely without success.
For the time being at any rate, Tommie was lost.
<P>
Hardyman promised to have the dog looked for in every part of the
farm, and to send him back in the care of one of his own men.
With these polite assurances Lady Lydiard was obliged to be
satisfied. She drove away in a very despondent frame of mind.
"First Isabel, and now Tommie," thought her Ladyship. "I am
losing the only companions who made life tolerable to me."
<P>
Returning from the garden gate, after taking leave of his
visitor, Hardyman received from his servant a handful of letters
which had just arrived for him. Walking slowly over the lawn as
he opened them, he found nothing but excuses for the absence of
guests who had already accepted their invitations. He had just
thrust the letters into his pocket, when he heard footsteps
behind him, and, looking
 round, found himself confronted by Moody.
<P>
"Hullo! have you come to lunch?" Hardyman asked, roughly.
<P>
"I have come here, sir, with a little gift for Miss Isabel, in
honor of her marriage," Moody answered quietly, "and I ask your
permission to put it on the table, so that she may see it when
your guests sit down to luncheon."
<P>
He opened a jeweler's case as he spoke, containing a plain gold
bracelet with an inscription engraved on the inner side: "To Miss
Isabel Miller, with the sincere good wishes of Robert Moody."
<P>
Plain as it was, the design of the bracelet was unusually
beautiful. Hardyman had noticed Moody's agitation on the day when
he had met Isabel near her aunt's house, and had drawn his own
conclusions from it. His face darkened with a momentary jealousy
as he looked at the bracelet. "All right, old fellow!" he said,
with contemptuous familiarity. "Don't be modest. Wait and give it
to her with your own hand."
<P>
"No, sir," said Moody "I would rather leave it, if you please, to
speak for itself."
<P>
Hardyman understood the delicacy of feeling which dictated those
words, and, without well knowing why, resented it. He was on the
point of speaking, under the influence of this unworthy motive,
when Isabel's voice reached his ears, calling to him from the
cottage.
<P>
Moody's face contracted with a sudden expression of pain as he,
too, recognized the voice. "Don't let me detain you, sir," he
said, sadly. "Good-morning!"
<P>
Hardyman left him without ceremony. Moody, slowly following,
entered the tent. All the preparations for the luncheon had been
completed; nobody was there. The places to be occupied by the
guests were indicated by cards bearing their names. Moody found
Isabel's card, and put his bracelet inside the folded napkin on
her plate. For a while he stood with his hand on the table,
thinking. The temptation to communicate once more with Isabel
before he lost her forever, was fast getting the better of his
powers of resistance.
<P>
"If I could persuade her to write a word to say she liked her
bracelet," he thought, "it would be a comfort when I go back to
my solitary life." He tore a leaf out of his pocket book and
wrote on it, "One line to say you accept my gift and my good
wishes. Put it under the cushion of your chair, and I shall find
it when the company have left the tent." He slipped the paper
into the case which held the bracelet, and instead of leaving the
farm as he had intended, turned back to the shelter of the
shrubbery.
