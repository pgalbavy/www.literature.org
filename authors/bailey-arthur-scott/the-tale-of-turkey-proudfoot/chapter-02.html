<p>Farmer Green owned six geese. Though there was an even number of them,
they were odd creatures. They had little to do with the other farmyard
folk, but kept much to themselves. If one of them started up the road on
some errand, the other five always followed her. If one of them suddenly
took it into her head to enjoy a swim her five companions were sure to
want one too, and waddled with her to the duck pond.
</p>
<p>Now, Turkey Proudfoot never went swimming. Like all the rest of the
flock over which he ruled, he thought swimming was bad for one's
health. He couldn't understand how anybody could enjoy cold water,
except for drinking purposes. And somehow he always felt as if his
feathers had been a bit ruffled whenever he saw the six geese set out
for the duck pond. Although their taking a swim was no affair of his,
still it made him angry.
</p><p>"Look at those geese!" he would gobble angrily to anybody that happened
to be near him. "They're going to take another cold, wet bath. They're
old enough to know better. I often wonder why Farmer Green wants such a
stupid crew on his farm. The Silly Six, I call 'em!"
</p><p>When Turkey Proudfoot talked in that fashion there were some that didn't
agree with him. The ducks never failed to quack their displeasure. And
old Spot sometimes growled and told him he'd be the better for a good
swim.
</p><p>But Turkey Proudfoot always declared, in answer to that, that he knew
he'd catch his death of cold if he ever stepped into the duck pond. And
there were some of the same mind as he.
</p><p>There was Miss Kitty Cat, who never liked to get her feet wet and on
stormy days lay by the hour beneath the kitchen stove and dozed.
</p><p>And there was the rooster. He didn't believe in wet, cold baths. He
liked dry dust baths. And when, one day, Turkey Proudfoot turned to him
suddenly and gobbled, "There go the Silly Six to swim!" the rooster
answered with a sniff, "Well, let 'em go! Don't stop 'em on my account.
I certainly don't want to join them."
</p><p>Turkey Proudfoot was all ready for a quarrel. "I hope you don't think
_I_ want to go swimming with the geese," he retorted. There was a
dangerous glitter in his eyes.
</p><p>Seeing this, the rooster made haste to assure Turkey Proudfoot that he
meant nothing of the sort.
</p><p>"Don't let's quarrel!" the rooster cried--for he was much smaller than
Turkey Proudfoot. "There's nothing for us to quarrel about. We're of the
same mind about the geese and their swimming."
</p><p>"I'm disappointed," Turkey Proudfoot told him. "For a moment I thought I
had an excuse for fighting you. And I'm not sure that I oughtn't to be
angry with you for agreeing with me when I didn't expect you to."
</p><p>The rooster gave a hoarse crow. He thought Turkey Proudfoot was joking.
And being afraid of Turkey Proudfoot, the rooster felt obliged to laugh
loudly at his jokes.
</p><p>"Don't laugh at me!" Turkey Proudfoot cried.
</p><p>"C-c-can't I laugh at the six silly geese?" the rooster stammered.
</p><p>"Yes!" said Turkey Proudfoot. "Yes--if you see anything funny about
them. For my part, I couldn't laugh at them if I tried to. The mere
thought of plunging into cold water almost gives me a chill."
