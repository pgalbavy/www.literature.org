<p>Far up Blue Mountain, and down in the valley too, the leaves had long
ago fallen off the trees. And for some time the ground had been white
with snow; for winter had come again. And Cuffy Bear's sister Silkie had
had a birthday-party the very first day it snowed. Cuffy and Silkie
shouted with glee each morning now, when they went out of doors, where
the earth was covered with a snow-blanket. And they played and played
and had just as good a time as little boys and girls have when winter
comes. As they scampered about in the door-yard their feet left tracks
that looked exactly like the foot-prints of barefooted girls and boys.
They played tag, and hide-and-seek, and turned somersaults. And one day,
when Mrs. Bear called them into the house, they ate, each of them,
several quarts of chestnuts which Mr. Bear had gathered and brought
home. In fact, before Mrs. Bear knew it they had eaten a great many more
chestnuts than were good for them. And Cuffy, who had eaten the most,
soon began to have a pain in his stomach.
</p>
<p>"That's what you get for being greedy," his mother told him.
</p><p>"I didn't eat many chestnuts," Cuffy said.
</p><p>Mrs. Bear pointed to the floor.
</p><p>"What do you call those?" she asked.
</p><p>"Chestnut-shells," Cuffy replied, hanging his head. There was a great
heap of shells on the floor where Cuffy had sat.
</p><p>"Pick them all up--every one of them," his mother ordered. "And when
you have finished you may take a nap--both of you."
</p><p>Cuffy yawned.
</p><p>"What do you say?" Mrs. Bear asked severely.
</p><p>"Excuse me!" Cuffy said hastily.
</p><p>"That's better!" said Mrs. Bear. "Now do as I say. You'll be asleep
before you know it. And I don't intend to have those chestnut shells
lying on the floor all winter."
</p><p>You may think that that was a queer thing for Mrs. Bear to say. But when
you see what happened, you'll understand what Mrs. Bear meant.
</p><p>As Cuffy and Silkie sat down on the floor and began gathering up the
chestnut-shells they both yawned and yawned. And since Mrs. Bear had
left the room they didn't bother to say "Excuse me!" They were <u>so</u>
sleepy! And before little Silkie had finished picking up her shells she
just rolled herself up into a round ball and fell fast asleep. As for
Cuffy, being a little older, he managed to stay awake just long enough
to get the floor all nice and clean. And then <u>he</u> rolled himself into a
ball and <u>he</u> went to sleep, right there on the floor.
</p><p>So Mrs. Bear found them when she came back into the room. She smiled as
she saw them. And picking up first one and then the other she carried
them into their little bed-chamber and put them down gently and covered
them over with leaves, so they would be snug and warm. Yes, Mrs. Bear
wanted her children to be warm, for she knew that they would not wake up
again until spring. She had noticed for several days that Cuffy and
Silkie were growing sleepy. And to tell the truth, Mrs. Bear was
becoming sleepy herself. That very night she and Mr. Bear went to bed a
whole hour earlier than usual. And the next day they never minded at all
how cold it grew outside or how much the wind howled. For not one of Mr.
Bear's family waked up at all! They just slept and slept and slept, the
whole winter long.

<p><strong>THE END</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>A WORD TO GROWN UPS</strong>
</p>
<p>To you;--parents, guardians, teachers and all others upon whom devolves
the supremely important responsibility of directing the early years of
development of childhood, this series of TUCK-ME-IN TALES which sketch
such vivid and delightful scenes of the vibrant life of meadow and
woodland should have tremendous appeal. In this collection of stories
you will find precisely the sort of healthy, imaginative entertainment
that is an essential in stimulating thought-germs in the child mind.
</p><p>Merely from the standpoint of their desirability for helping the growing
tot to pass an idle half hour, any one of these volumes would be worth
your while. But the author had something further than that in mind. He
has, with simplicity and grace, worthy of high commendation, sought to
convey a two-fold lesson throughout the entire series, the first based
upon natural history and the second upon the elementary principles of
living which should be made clear to every child at the earliest age of
understanding.
</p><p>The first of these aims he has accomplished by adapting every one of his
bird characters to its living counterpart in the realm of biology. The
child learns very definite truths about which the story is woven; learns
in such a fascinating manner that he will not quickly forget, and is
brought into such pleasant intimacy that his immediate sympathy is
aroused.
</p><p>The author accomplishes the purpose of driving home simple lessons on
good conduct by attributing the many of the same traits of character to
his feathered heroes and heroines that are to be found wherever the
human race made its habitation. The praise-worthy qualities of courage,
love, unselfishness, truth, industry, and humility are portrayed in the
dealings of the field and forest folk and the consequential reward of
these virtues is clearly shown; he also reveals the unhappy results of
greed, jealousy, trickery and other character weaknesses. The effect is
to impress indelibly upon the imagination of the child that certain
deeds are their own desirable reward while certain others are much
better left undone.
</p><p>If any further recommendation is necessary, would it not be well to
resort to the court of final appeal, the child himself? Simply purchase
a trial copy from your bookseller with the understanding that if it
meets with the disapproval of the little man or woman for whom it is
intended, he will accept its return.
