<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Jorgenson, after seeing the canoe leave the ship's side, ceased
to live intellectually. There was no need for more thinking, for
any display of mental ingenuity. He had done with it all. All
his notions were perfectly fixed and he could go over them in
the same ghostly way in which he haunted the deck of the Emma.
At the sight of the ring Lingard would return to Hassim and Immada,
now captives, too, though Jorgenson certainly did not think them
in any serious danger. What had happened really was that Tengga
was now holding hostages, and those Jorgenson looked upon as Lingard's
own people. They were his. He had gone in with them deep, very
deep. They had a hold and a claim on King Tom just as many years
ago people of that very race had had a hold and a claim on him,
Jorgenson. Only Tom was a much bigger man. A very big man. Nevertheless,
Jorgenson didn't see why he should escape his own fate &mdash;Jorgenson's
fate&mdash;to be absorbed, captured, made their own either in failure
or in success. It was an unavoidable fatality and Jorgenson felt
certain that the ring would compel Lingard to face it without
flinching. What he really wanted Lingard to do was to cease to
take the slightest interest in those whites&mdash;who were the sort
of people that left no footprints.</p>

<p>Perhaps at first sight, sending that woman to Lingard was not
the best way toward that end. Jorgenson, however, had a distinct
impression in which his morning talk with Mrs. Travers had only
confirmed him, that those two had quarrelled for good. As, indeed,
was unavoidable. What did Tom Lingard want with any woman? The
only woman in Jorgenson's life had come in by way of exchange
for a lot of cotton stuffs and several brass guns. This fact could
not but affect Jorgenson's judgment since obviously in this case
such a transaction was impossible. Therefore the case was not
serious. It didn't exist. What did exist was Lingard's relation
to the Wajo exiles, a great and warlike adventure such as no rover
in those seas had ever attempted.</p>

<p>That Tengga was much more ready to negotiate than to fight, the
old adventurer had not the slightest doubt. How Lingard would
deal with him was not a concern of Jorgenson's. That would be
easy enough. Nothing prevented Lingard from going to see Tengga
and talking to him with authority. All that ambitious person really
wanted was to have a share in Lingard's wealth, in Lingard's power,
in Lingard's friendship. A year before Tengga had once insinuated
to Jorgenson, "In what way am I less worthy of being a friend
than Belarab?"</p>

<p>It was a distinct overture, a disclosure of the man's innermost
mind. Jorgenson, of course, had met it with a profound silence.
His task was not diplomacy but the care of stores.</p>

<p>After the effort of connected mental processes in order to bring
about Mrs. Travers' departure he was anxious to dismiss the whole
matter from his mind. The last thought he gave to it was severely
practical. It occurred to him that it would be advisable to attract
in some way or other Lingard's attention to the lagoon. In the
language of the sea a single rocket is properly a signal of distress,
but, in the circumstances, a group of three sent up simultaneously
would convey a warning. He gave his orders and watched the rockets
go up finely with a trail of red sparks, a bursting of white stars
high up in the air, and three loud reports in quick succession.
Then he resumed his pacing of the whole length of the hulk, confident
that after this Tom would guess that something was up and set
a close watch over the lagoon. No doubt these mysterious rockets
would have a disturbing effect on Tengga and his friends and cause
a great excitement in the Settlement; but for that Jorgenson did
not care. The Settlement was already in such a turmoil that a
little more excitement did not matter. What Jorgenson did not
expect, however, was the sound of a musket-shot fired from the
jungle facing the bows of the Emma. It caused him to stop dead
short. He had heard distinctly the bullet strike the curve of
the bow forward. "Some hot-headed ass fired that," he said to
himself, contemptuously. It simply disclosed to him the fact that
he was already besieged on the shore side and set at rest his
doubts as to the length Tengga was prepared to go. Any length!
Of course there was still time for Tom to put everything right
with six words, unless . . . Jorgenson smiled, grimly, in the
dark and resumed his tireless pacing.</p>

<p>What amused him was to observe the fire which had been burning
night and day before Tengga's residence suddenly extinguished.
He pictured to himself the wild rush with bamboo buckets to the
lagoon shore, the confusion, the hurry and jostling in a great
hissing of water midst clouds of steam. The image of the fat Tengga's
consternation appealed to Jorgenson's sense of humour for about
five seconds. Then he took up the binoculars from the roof of
the deckhouse.</p>

<p>The bursting of the three white stars over the lagoon had given
him a momentary glimpse of the black speck of the canoe taking
over Mrs. Travers. He couldn't find it again with the glass, it
was too dark; but the part of the shore for which it was steered
would be somewhere near the angle of Belarab's stockade nearest
to the beach. This Jorgenson could make out in the faint rosy
glare of fires burning inside. Jorgenson was certain that Lingard
was looking toward the Emma through the most convenient loophole
he could find.</p>

<p>As obviously Mrs. Travers could not have paddled herself across,
two men were taking her over; and for the steersman she had Jaffir.
Though he had assented to Jorgenson's plan Jaffir was anxious
to accompany the ring as near as possible to its destination.
Nothing but dire necessity had induced him to part with the talisman.
Crouching in the stern and flourishing his paddle from side to
side he glared at the back of the canvas deck-chair which had
been placed in the middle for Mrs. Travers. Wrapped up in the
darkness she reclined in it with her eyes closed, faintly aware
of the ring hung low on her breast. As the canoe was rather large
it was moving very slowly. The two men dipped their paddles without
a splash: and surrendering herself passively, in a temporary relaxation
of all her limbs, to this adventure Mrs. Travers had no sense
of motion at all. She, too, like Jorgenson, was tired of thinking.
She abandoned herself to the silence of that night full of roused
passions and deadly purposes. She abandoned herself to an illusory
feeling; to the impression that she was really resting. For the
first time in many days she could taste the relief of being alone.
The men with her were less than nothing. She could not speak to
them; she could not understand them; the canoe might have been
moving by enchantment&mdash;if it did move at all. Like a half-conscious
sleeper she was on the verge of saying to herself, "What a strange
dream I am having."</p>

<p>The low tones of Jaffir's voice stole into it quietly telling
the men to cease paddling, and the long canoe came to a rest slowly,
no more than ten yards from the beach. The party had been provided
with a torch which was to be lighted before the canoe touched
the shore, thus giving a character of openness to this desperate
expedition. "And if it draws fire on us," Jaffir had commented
to Jorgenson, "well, then, we shall see whose fate it is to die
on this night."</p>

<p>"Yes," had muttered Jorgenson. "We shall see."</p>

<p>Jorgenson saw at last the small light of the torch against the
blackness of the stockade. He strained his hearing for a possible
volley of musketry fire but no sound came to him over the broad
surface of the lagoon. Over there the man with the torch, the
other paddler, and Jaffir himself impelling with a gentle motion
of his paddle the canoe toward the shore, had the glistening eyeballs
and the tense faces of silent excitement. The ruddy glare smote
Mrs. Travers' closed eyelids but she didn't open her eyes till
she felt the canoe touch the strand. The two men leaped instantly
out of it. Mrs. Travers rose, abruptly. Nobody made a sound. She
stumbled out of the canoe on to the beach and almost before she
had recovered her balance the torch was thrust into her hand.
The heat, the nearness of the blaze confused and blinded her till,
instinctively, she raised the torch high above her head. For a
moment she stood still, holding aloft the fierce flame from which
a few sparks were falling slowly.</p>

<p>A naked bronze arm lighted from above pointed out the direction
and Mrs. Travers began to walk toward the featureless black mass
of the stockade. When after a few steps she looked back over her
shoulder, the lagoon, the beach, the canoe, the men she had just
left had become already invisible. She was alone bearing up a
blazing torch on an earth that was a dumb shadow shifting under
her feet. At last she reached firmer ground and the dark length
of the palisade untouched as yet by the light of the torch seemed
to her immense, intimidating. She felt ready to drop from sheer
emotion. But she moved on.</p>

<p>"A little more to the left," shouted a strong voice.</p>

<p>It vibrated through all her fibres, rousing like the call of
a trumpet, went far beyond her, filled all the space. Mrs. Travers
stood still for a moment, then casting far away from her the burning
torch ran forward blindly with her hands extended toward the great
sound of Lingard's voice, leaving behind her the light flaring
and spluttering on the ground. She stumbled and was only saved
from a fall by her hands coming in contact with the rough stakes.
The stockade rose high above her head and she clung to it with
widely open arms, pressing her whole body against the rugged surface
of that enormous and unscalable palisade. She heard through it
low voices inside, heavy thuds; and felt at every blow a slight
vibration of the ground under her feet. She glanced fearfully
over her shoulder and saw nothing in the darkness but the expiring
glow of the torch she had thrown away and the sombre shimmer of
the lagoon bordering the opaque darkness of the shore. Her strained
eyeballs seemed to detect mysterious movements in the darkness
and she gave way to irresistible terror, to a shrinking agony
of apprehension. Was she to be transfixed by a broad blade, to
the high, immovable wall of wood against which she was flattening
herself desperately, as though she could hope to penetrate it
by the mere force of her fear? She had no idea where she was,
but as a matter of fact she was a little to the left of the principal
gate and almost exactly under one of the loopholes of the stockade.
Her excessive anguish passed into insensibility. She ceased to
hear, to see, and even to feel the contact of the surface to which
she clung. Lingard's voice somewhere from the sky above her head
was directing her, distinct, very close, full of concern.</p>

<p>"You must stoop low. Lower yet."</p>

<p>The stagnant blood of her body began to pulsate languidly. She
stooped low&mdash;lower yet&mdash;so low that she had to sink on her knees,
and then became aware of a faint smell of wood smoke mingled with
the confused murmur of agitated voices. This came to her through
an opening no higher than her head in her kneeling posture, and
no wider than the breadth of two stakes. Lingard was saying in
a tone of distress:</p>

<p>"I couldn't get any of them to unbar the gate."</p>

<p>She was unable to make a sound.&mdash;"Are you there?" Lingard asked,
anxiously, so close to her now that she seemed to feel the very
breath of his words on her face. It revived her completely; she
understood what she had to do. She put her head and shoulders
through the opening, was at once seized under the arms by an eager
grip and felt herself pulled through with an irresistible force
and with such haste that her scarf was dragged off her head, its
fringes having caught in the rough timber. The same eager grip
lifted her up, stood her on her feet without her having to make
any exertion toward that end. She became aware that Lingard was
trying to say something, but she heard only a confused stammering
expressive of wonder and delight in which she caught the words
"You . . . you . . ." deliriously repeated. He didn't release
his hold of her; his helpful and irresistible grip had changed
into a close clasp, a crushing embrace, the violent taking possession
by an embodied force that had broken loose and was not to be controlled
any longer. As his great voice had done a moment before, his great
strength, too, seemed able to fill all space in its enveloping
and undeniable authority. Every time she tried instinctively to
stiffen herself against its might, it reacted, affirming its fierce
will, its uplifting power. Several times she lost the feeling
of the ground and had a sensation of helplessness without fear,
of triumph without exultation. The inevitable had come to pass.
She had foreseen it&mdash;and all the time in that dark place and against
the red glow of camp fires within the stockade the man in whose
arms she struggled remained shadowy to her eyes&mdash;to her half-closed
eyes. She thought suddenly, "He will crush me to death without
knowing it."</p>

<p>He was like a blind force. She closed her eyes altogether. Her
head fell back a little. Not instinctively but with wilful resignation
and as it were from a sense of justice she abandoned herself to
his arms. The effect was as though she had suddenly stabbed him
to the heart. He let her go so suddenly and completely that she
would have fallen down in a heap if she had not managed to catch
hold of his forearm. He seemed prepared for it and for a moment
all her weight hung on it without moving its rigidity by a hair's
breadth. Behind her Mrs. Travers heard the heavy thud of blows
on wood, the confused murmurs and movements of men.</p>

<p>A voice said suddenly, "It's done," with such emphasis that though,
of course, she didn't understand the words it helped her to regain
possession of herself; and when Lingard asked her very little
above a whisper: "Why don't you say something?" she answered readily,
"Let me get my breath first."</p>

<p>Round them all sounds had ceased. The men had secured again the
opening through which those arms had snatched her into a moment
of self-forgetfulness which had left her out of breath but uncrushed.
As if something imperative had been satisfied she had a moment
of inward serenity, a period of peace without thought while, holding
to that arm that trembled no more than an arm of iron, she felt
stealthily over the ground for one of the sandals which she had
lost. Oh, yes, there was no doubt of it, she had been carried
off the earth, without shame, without regret. But she would not
have let him know of that dropped sandal for anything in the world.
That lost sandal was as symbolic as a dropped veil. But he did
not know of it. He must never know. Where was that thing? She
felt sure that they had not moved an inch from that spot. Presently
her foot found it and still gripping Lingard's forearm she stooped
to secure it properly. When she stood up, still holding his arm,
they confronted each other, he rigid in an effort of self-command
but feeling as if the surges of the heaviest sea that he could
remember in his life were running through his heart; and the woman
as if emptied of all feeling by her experience, without thought
yet, but beginning to regain her sense of the situation and the
memory of the immediate past.</p>

<p>"I have been watching at that loophole for an hour, ever since
they came running to me with that story of the rockets," said
Lingard. "I was shut up with Belarab then. I was looking out when
the torch blazed and you stepped ashore. I thought I was dreaming.
But what could I do? I felt I must rush to you but I dared not.
That clump of palms is full of men. So are the houses you saw
that time you came ashore with me. Full of men. Armed men. A trigger
is soon pulled and when once shooting begins. . . . And you walking
in the open with that light above your head! I didn't dare. You
were safer alone. I had the strength to hold myself in and watch
you come up from the shore. No! No man that ever lived had seen
such a sight. What did you come for?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you expect somebody? I don't mean me, I mean a messenger?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Lingard, wondering at his own self-control. "Why did
he let you come?"</p>

<p>"You mean Captain Jorgenson? Oh, he refused at first. He said
that he had your orders."</p>

<p>"How on earth did you manage to get round him?" said Lingard
in his softest tones.</p>

<p>"I did not try," she began and checked herself. Lingard's question,
though he really didn't seem to care much about an answer, had
aroused afresh her suspicion of Jorgenson's change of front. "I
didn't have to say very much at the last," she continued, gasping
yet a little and feeling her personality, crushed to nothing in
the hug of those arms, expand again to its full significance before
the attentive immobility of that man. "Captain Jorgenson has always
looked upon me as a nuisance. Perhaps he had made up his mind
to get rid of me even against your orders. Is he quite sane?"</p>

<p>She released her firm hold of that iron forearm which fell slowly
by Lingard's side. She had regained fully the possession of her
personality. There remained only a fading, slightly breathless
impression of a short flight above that earth on which her feet
were firmly planted now. "And is that all?" she asked herself,
not bitterly, but with a sort of tender contempt.</p>

<p>"He is so sane," sounded Lingard's voice, gloomily, "that if
I had listened to him you would not have found me here."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by here? In this stockade?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere," he said.</p>

<p>"And what would have happened then?"</p>

<p>"God knows," he answered. "What would have happened if the world
had not been made in seven days? I have known you for just about
that time. It began by me coming to you at night&mdash;like a thief
in the night. Where the devil did I hear that? And that man you
are married to thinks I am no better than a thief."</p>

<p>"It ought to be enough for you that I never made a mistake as
to what you are, that I come to you in less than twenty-four hours
after you left me contemptuously to my distress. Don't pretend
you didn't hear me call after you. Oh, yes, you heard. The whole
ship heard me for I had no shame."</p>

<p>"Yes, you came," said Lingard, violently. "But have you really
come? I can't believe my eyes! Are you really here?"</p>

<p>"This is a dark spot, luckily," said Mrs. Travers. "But can you
really have any doubt?" she added, significantly.</p>

<p>He made a sudden movement toward her, betraying so much passion
that Mrs. Travers thought, "I shan't come out alive this time,"
and yet he was there, motionless before her, as though he had
never stirred. It was more as though the earth had made a sudden
movement under his feet without being able to destroy his balance.
But the earth under Mrs. Travers' feet had made no movement and
for a second she was overwhelmed by wonder not at this proof of
her own self-possession but at the man's immense power over himself.
If it had not been for her strange inward exhaustion she would
perhaps have surrendered to that power. But it seemed to her that
she had nothing in her worth surrendering, and it was in a perfectly
even tone that she said, "Give me your arm, Captain Lingard. We
can't stay all night on this spot."</p>

<p>As they moved on she thought, "There is real greatness in that
man."  He was great even in his behaviour. No apologies, no explanations,
no abasement, no violence, and not even the slightest tremor of
the frame holding that bold and perplexed soul. She knew that
for certain because her fingers were resting lightly on Lingard's
arm while she walked slowly by his side as though he were taking
her down to dinner. And yet she couldn't suppose for a moment,
that, like herself, he was emptied of all emotion. She never before
was so aware of him as a dangerous force. "He is really ruthless,"
she thought. They had just left the shadow of the inner defences
about the gate when a slightly hoarse, apologetic voice was heard
behind them repeating insistently, what even Mrs. Travers' ear
detected to be a sort of formula. The words were: "There is this
thing&mdash;there is this thing&mdash;there is this thing." They turned
round.</p>

<p>"Oh, my scarf," said Mrs. Travers.</p>

<p>A short, squat, broad-faced young fellow having for all costume
a pair of white drawers was offering the scarf thrown over both
his arms, as if they had been sticks, and holding it respectfully
as far as possible from his person. Lingard took it from him and
Mrs. Travers claimed it at once. "Don't forget the proprieties,"
she said. "This is also my face veil."</p>

<p>She was arranging it about her head when Lingard said, "There
is no need. I am taking you to those gentlemen."&mdash;"I will use
it all the same," said Mrs. Travers. "This thing works both ways,
as a matter of propriety or as a matter of precaution. Till I
have an opportunity of looking into a mirror nothing will persuade
me that there isn't some change in my face." Lingard swung half
round and gazed down at her. Veiled now she confronted him boldly.
"Tell me, Captain Lingard, how many eyes were looking at us a
little while ago?"</p>

<p>"Do you care?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," she said. "A million stars were looking on,
too, and what did it matter? They were not of the world I know.
And it's just the same with the eyes. They are not of the world
I live in."</p>

<p>Lingard thought: "Nobody is." Never before had she seemed to
him more unapproachable, more different and more remote. The glow
of a number of small fires lighted the ground only, and brought
out the black bulk of men lying down in the thin drift of smoke.
Only one of these fires, rather apart and burning in front of
the house which was the quarter of the prisoners, might have been
called a blaze and even that was not a great one. It didn't penetrate
the dark space between the piles and the depth of the verandah
above where only a couple of heads and the glint of a spearhead
could be seen dimly in the play of the light. But down on the
ground outside, the black shape of a man seated on a bench had
an intense relief. Another intensely black shadow threw a handful
of brushwood on the fire and went away. The man on the bench got
up. It was d'Alcacer. He let Lingard and Mrs. Travers come quite
close up to him. Extreme surprise seemed to have made him dumb.</p>

<p>"You didn't expect . . ." began Mrs. Travers with some embarrassment
before that mute attitude.</p>

<p>"I doubted my eyes," struck in d'Alcacer, who seemed embarrassed,
too. Next moment he recovered his tone and confessed simply: "At
the moment I wasn't thinking of you, Mrs. Travers." He passed
his hand over his forehead. "I hardly know what I was thinking
of."</p>

<p>In the light of the shooting-up flame Mrs. Travers could see
d'Alcacer's face. There was no smile on it. She could not remember
ever seeing him so grave and, as it were, so distant. She abandoned
Lingard's arm and moved closer to the fire.</p>

<p>"I fancy you were very far away, Mr. d'Alcacer," she said.</p>

<p>"This is the sort of freedom of which nothing can deprive us,"
he observed, looking hard at the manner in which the scarf was
drawn across Mrs. Travers' face. "It's possible I was far away,"
he went on, "but I can assure you that I don't know where I was.
Less than an hour ago we had a great excitement here about some
rockets, but I didn't share in it. There was no one I could ask
a question of. The captain here was, I understood, engaged in
a most momentous conversation with the king or the governor of
this place."</p>

<p>He addressed Lingard, directly. "May I ask whether you have reached
any conclusion as yet? That Moor is a very dilatory person, I
believe."</p>

<p>"Any direct attack he would, of course, resist," said Lingard.
"And, so far, you are protected. But I must admit that he is rather
angry with me. He's tired of the whole business. He loves peace
above anything in the world. But I haven't finished with him yet."</p>

<p>"As far as I understood from what you told me before," said Mr.
d'Alcacer, with a quick side glance at Mrs. Travers' uncovered
and attentive eyes, "as far as I can see he may get all the peace
he wants at once by driving us two, I mean Mr. Travers and myself,
out of the gate on to the spears of those other enraged barbarians.
And there are some of his counsellors who advise him to do that
very thing no later than the break of day I understand."</p>

<p>Lingard stood for a moment perfectly motionless.</p>

<p>"That's about it," he said in an unemotional tone, and went away
with a heavy step without giving another look at d'Alcacer and
Mrs. Travers, who after a moment faced each other.</p>

<p>"You have heard?" said d'Alcacer. "Of course that doesn't affect
your fate in any way, and as to him he is much too prestigious
to be killed light-heartedly. When all this is over you will walk
triumphantly on his arm out of this stockade; for there is nothing
in all this to affect his greatness, his absolute value in the
eyes of those people&mdash;and indeed in any other eyes." D'Alcacer
kept his glance averted from Mrs. Travers and as soon as he had
finished speaking busied himself in dragging the bench a little
way further from the fire. When they sat down on it he kept his
distance from Mrs. Travers. She made no sign of unveiling herself
and her eyes without a face seemed to him strangely unknown and
disquieting.</p>

<p>"The situation in a nutshell," she said. "You have arranged it
all beautifully, even to my triumphal exit. Well, and what then?
No, you needn't answer, it has no interest. I assure you I came
here not with any notion of marching out in triumph, as you call
it. I came here, to speak in the most vulgar way, to save your
skin&mdash;and mine."</p>

<p>Her voice came muffled to d'Alcacer's ears with a changed character,
even to the very intonation. Above the white and embroidered scarf
her eyes in the firelight transfixed him, black and so steady
that even the red sparks of the reflected glare did not move in
them. He concealed the strong impression she made. He bowed his
head a little.</p>

<p>"I believe you know perfectly well what you are doing."</p>

<p>"No! I don't know," she said, more quickly than he had ever heard
her speak before. "First of all, I don't think he is so safe as
you imagine. Oh, yes, he has prestige enough, I don't question
that. But you are apportioning life and death with too much assurance.
. . ."</p>

<p>"I know my portion," murmured d'Alcacer, gently. A moment of
silence fell in which Mrs. Travers' eyes ended by intimidating
d'Alcacer, who looked away. The flame of the fire had sunk low.
In the dark agglomeration of buildings, which might have been
called Belarab's palace, there was a certain animation, a flitting
of people, voices calling and answering, the passing to and fro
of lights that would illuminate suddenly a heavy pile, the corner
of a house, the eaves of a low-pitched roof, while in the open
parts of the stockade the armed men slept by the expiring fires.</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers said, suddenly, "That Jorgenson is not friendly
to us."</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>With clasped hands and leaning over his knees d'Alcacer had assented
in a very low tone. Mrs. Travers, unobserved, pressed her hands
to her breast and felt the shape of the ring, thick, heavy, set
with a big stone. It was there, secret, hung against her heart,
and enigmatic. What did it mean? What could it mean? What was
the feeling it could arouse or the action it could provoke? And
she thought with compunction that she ought to have given it to
Lingard at once, without thinking, without hesitating. "There!
This is what I came for. To give you this." Yes, but there had
come an interval when she had been able to think of nothing, and
since then she had had the time to reflect&mdash;unfortunately. To
remember Jorgenson's hostile, contemptuous glance enveloping her
from head to foot at the break of a day after a night of lonely
anguish. And now while she sat there veiled from his keen sight
there was that other man, that d'Alcacer, prophesying. O yes,
triumphant. She knew already what that was. Mrs. Travers became
afraid of the ring. She felt ready to pluck it from her neck and
cast it away.</p>

<p>"I mistrust him," she said.&mdash;"You do!" exclaimed d'Alcacer, very
low.&mdash;"I mean that Jorgenson. He seems a merciless sort of creature."&mdash;"He
is indifferent to everything," said d'Alcacer.&mdash;"It may be a mask."&mdash;"Have
you some evidence, Mrs. Travers?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Travers without hesitation. "I have my instinct."</p>

<p>D'Alcacer remained silent for a while as though he were pursuing
another train of thought altogether, then in a gentle, almost
playful tone: "If I were a woman," he said, turning to Mrs. Travers,
"I would always trust my intuition."&mdash;"If you were a woman, Mr.
d'Alcacer, I would not be speaking to you in this way because
then I would be suspect to you."</p>

<p>The thought that before long perhaps he would be neither man
nor woman but a lump of cold clay, crossed d'Alcacer's mind, which
was living, alert, and unsubdued by the danger. He had welcomed
the arrival of Mrs. Travers simply because he had been very lonely
in that stockade, Mr. Travers having fallen into a phase of sulks
complicated with shivering fits. Of Lingard d'Alcacer had seen
almost nothing since they had landed, for the Man of Fate was
extremely busy negotiating in the recesses of Belarab's main hut;
and the thought that his life was being a matter of arduous bargaining
was not agreeable to Mr. d'Alcacer. The Chief's dependents and
the armed men garrisoning the stockade paid very little attention
to him apparently, and this gave him the feeling of his captivity
being very perfect and hopeless. During the afternoon, while pacing
to and fro in the bit of shade thrown by the glorified sort of
hut inside which Mr. Travers shivered and sulked misanthropically,
he had been aware of the more distant verandahs becoming filled
now and then by the muffled forms of women of Belarab's household
taking a distant and curious view of the white man. All this was
irksome. He found his menaced life extremely difficult to get
through. Yes, he welcomed the arrival of Mrs. Travers who brought
with her a tragic note into the empty gloom.</p>

<p>"Suspicion is not in my nature, Mrs. Travers, I assure you, and
I hope that you on your side will never suspect either my reserve
or my frankness. I respect the mysterious nature of your conviction
but hasn't Jorgenson given you some occasion to. . ."</p>

<p>"He hates me," said Mrs. Travers, and frowned at d'Alcacer's
incipient smile. "It isn't a delusion on my part. The worst is
that he hates me not for myself. I believe he is completely indifferent
to my existence. Jorgenson hates me because as it were I represent
you two who are in danger, because it is you two that are the
trouble and I . . . Well!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that's certain," said d'Alcacer, hastily. "But Jorgenson
is wrong in making you the scapegoat. For if you were not here
cool reason would step in and would make Lingard pause in his
passion to make a king out of an exile. If we were murdered it
would certainly make some stir in the world in time and he would
fall under the suspicion of complicity with those wild and inhuman
Moors. Who would regard the greatness of his day-dreams, his engaged
honour, his chivalrous feelings? Nothing could save him from that
suspicion. And being what he is, you understand me, Mrs. Travers
(but you know him much better than I do), it would morally kill
him."</p>

<p>"Heavens!" whispered Mrs. Travers. "This has never occurred to
me."  Those words seemed to lose themselves in the folds of the
scarf without reaching d'Alcacer, who continued in his gentle
tone:</p>

<p>'"However, as it is, he will be safe enough whatever happens.
He will have your testimony to clear him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers stood up, suddenly, but still careful to keep her
face covered, she threw the end of the scarf over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I fear that Jorgenson," she cried with suppressed passion. "One
can't understand what that man means to do. I think him so dangerous
that if I were, for instance, entrusted with a message bearing
on the situation, I would . . . suppress it."</p>

<p>D'Alcacer was looking up from the seat, full of wonder. Mrs.
Travers appealed to him in a calm voice through the folds of the
scarf:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mr. d'Alcacer, you who can look on it calmly, wouldn't
I be right?"</p>

<p>"Why, has Jorgenson told you anything?"</p>

<p>"Directly&mdash;nothing, except a phrase or two which really I could
not understand. They seemed to have a hidden sense and he appeared
to attach some mysterious importance to them that he dared not
explain to me."</p>

<p>"That was a risk on his part," exclaimed d'Alcacer. "And he trusted
you. Why you, I wonder!"</p>

<p>"Who can tell what notions he has in his head? Mr. d'Alcacer,
I believe his only object is to call Captain Lingard away from
us. I understood it only a few minutes ago. It has dawned upon
me. All he wants is to call him off."</p>

<p>"Call him off," repeated d'Alcacer, a little bewildered by the
aroused fire of her conviction. "I am sure I don't want him called
off any more than you do; and, frankly, I don't believe Jorgenson
has any such power. But upon the whole, and if you feel that Jorgenson
has the power, I would&mdash;yes, if I were in your place I think I
would suppress anything I could not understand."</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers listened to the very end. Her eyes&mdash;they appeared
incredibly sombre to d'Alcacer&mdash;seemed to watch the fall of every
deliberate word and after he had ceased they remained still for
an appreciable time. Then she turned away with a gesture that
seemed to say: "So be it."</p>

<p>D'Alcacer raised his voice suddenly after her. "Stay! Don't forget
that not only your husband's but my head, too, is being played
at that game. My judgment is not . . ."</p>

<p>She stopped for a moment and freed her lips. In the profound
stillness of the courtyard her clear voice made the shadows at
the nearest fires stir a little with low murmurs of surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember whose heads I have to save," she cried.
"But in all the world who is there to save that man from himself?"</p>
