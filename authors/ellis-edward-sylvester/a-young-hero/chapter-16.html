<p>When a horse takes it into his head to go home, with a view of
having a good meal, the attraction seems to become stronger from
the moment he makes the first move.</p>

<p>Bud Heyland's animal began with a very moderate pace, but he
increased it so rapidly that by the time the angry driver was
on the run, the quadruped was going almost equally as fast.</p>

<p>In the hope of scaring the brute into stopping Bud shouted:</p>

<p>"Whoa! whoa! Stop, or I'll kill you!"</p>

<p>If the horse understood the command, he did not appreciate the
threat, and, therefore, it served rather as a spur to his exertion,
for he went faster than ever.</p>

<p>It is well known, also, that under such circumstances the sagacious
animal is only intent on reaching home with the least delay, and
he does not care a pin whether his flight injures the vehicle
behind him or not. In fact, he seems to be better pleased if it
does suffer some disarrangement.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the animal debouched from the wood into the
faint light under the stars he was on a gallop, and the wagon
was bounding along from side to side in an alarming way. Bud was
not far behind it, and shouting in his fiercest manner, he soon
saw that he was only wasting his strength. He then ceased his
outcries and devoted all his energies to overtaking the runaway
horse.</p>

<p>"It'll be just like him to smash the wagon all to flinders,"
growled Bud, "and I'll have to pay for the damages."</p>

<p>As nearly as could be determined, horse and lad were going at
the same pace, the boy slightly gaining, perhaps, and growing
more furious each minute, for this piece of treachery on the part
of the horse.</p>

<p>Some twenty yards separated the pursuer from the team, when a
heavy, lumbering wagon loomed to view ahead.</p>

<p>"Get out of the road!" called Bud, excitedly. "This hoss is running
away, and he'll smash you if you don't!"</p>

<p>At such times a farmer is slow to grasp the situation, and the
old gentleman, who was half asleep, could not understand what
all the rumpus was about, until the galloping horse was upon him.
Then he wrenched his lines, hoping to pull his team aside in time,
but his honest nags were as slow as their owner, and all they
did was to get themselves out of the way, so as to allow the light
vehicle to crash into that to which they were attached.</p>

<p>It is the frailer vessel which generally goes to the wall at
such times, though Bud's was armed with a good deal of momentum.
As it was the front wheel was twisted off, and the frightened
horse continued at a swifter gait than ever toward his home, while
Bud, seeing how useless it was to try to overtake him, turned
upon the old farmer, who was carefully climbing out of his wagon
to see whether his property had suffered any damage.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you get out the way when I hollered to you?" demanded
the panting Bud, advancing threateningly upon him.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you holler sooner, my young friend?" asked the old
gentleman, in a soft voice.</p>

<p>"I yelled to you soon enough, and you're a big fool that you
didn't pull aside as I told you. I hope your old rattle-trap has
been hurt so it can't be fixed up."</p>

<p>"I can't diskiver that it's been hurt at all, and I'm very thankful,"
remarked the farmer, stooping down and feeling the spokes and
axletree with his hands; "but don't you know it is very disrespectful
for a boy like you to call an old man a fool?"</p>

<p>Bud snarled:</p>

<p>"I generally say just what I mean, and what are you going to
do about it, old Hay Seed?"</p>

<p>The gentleman thus alluded to showed what he meant to do about
it, for he reached quietly upward and lifted his whip from its
socket in the front of the wagon.</p>

<p>"I say again," added Bud, not noticing the movement, and swaggering
about, "that any man who acts like you is a natural born fool,
and the best thing you can do is to go home&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then something cracked like a pistol shot and the whip of
the old farmer whizzed about the legs of the astounded scapegrace,
who, with a howl similar to that which Fred Sheldon uttered under
similar treatment, bounded high in air and started on a run in
the direction of his flying vehicle.</p>

<p>At the second step the whip descended again, and it was repeated
several times before the terrified Bud could get beyond reach
of the indignant gentleman, who certainly showed more vigor than
any one not knowing him would have looked for.</p>

<p>"Some boys is very disrespectful, and should be teached manners,"
he muttered, turning calmly about and going back to his team,
which stood sleepily in the road awaiting him.</p>

<p>"What's getting into folks?" growled Bud Heyland, trying to rub
his smarting legs in half a dozen places at once; "that's the
sassiest old curmudgeon I ever seen. If I'd knowed he was so sensitive
I wouldn't have argued the matter so strong. Jingo! But he knows
how to swing a whip. When he brought down the lash on to me, I
orter just jumped right into him and knocked him down, and I'd
done it, too, if I hadn't been afraid of one thing, which was
that he'd knocked me down first. Plague on him! I'll get even
with him yet. I wish&#11834;"</p>

<p>Bud stopped short in inexpressible disgust, for just then he
recalled that he had his loaded revolver with him, and he ought
to have used it to defend himself.</p>

<p>The assault of the old gentleman was so sudden that his victim
had no time to think of anything but to place himself beyond reach
of his strong and active arm.</p>

<p>"I don't know what makes me so blamed slow in thinking of things,"
added Bud, resuming the rubbing of his legs and his walk toward
Tottenville, "but I must learn to wake up sooner. I'm sure I got
in some good work to-day, and I'll finish it up in style to-morrow
night, or my name ain't Nathaniel Higgins Heyland, and then I'm
going to skip out of this slow place in a hurry and have a good
time with the boys. What's that?"</p>

<p>He discerned the dim outlines of some peculiar looking object
in the road, and going to it, suddenly saw what it was.</p>

<p>"Yes, I might have knowed it!" he muttered, with another forcible
expression; "it's a wagon wheel; the second one off that good-for-nothing
one I hired of Grimsby, and I'll have a pretty bill to pay when
I get there. I 'spose I'll find the rest of the wagon strewed
all along the road; yes&#11834;"</p>

<p>Bud was not far wrong in his supposition, for a little further
on he came upon a third wheel, which was leaning against the fence,
as though it were "tired," and near by was the fourth.</p>

<p>After that the fragments of the ruined vehicle were met with
continually, until the angered young man wondered how it was there
could be so much material in such an ordinary structure.</p>

<p>"It's about time I begun to find something of the horse," he
added, with a grim sense of the grotesque humor of the idea; "I
wouldn't care if I came across his head and legs scattered along
the road, for I'm mad enough agin him to blow him up, but I won't
get the chance, for old Grimsby won't let me have him agin when
I go out to take a ride to-morrow night."</p>

<p>Things could not have been in a worse condition than when Bud,
tired and angry, walked up on the porch of the hotel and dropped
wearily into one of the chairs that were always there.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Grimsby was awaiting him, and said the animal was badly
bruised, and as for the wagon, the only portion he could find
any trace of was the shafts, which came bounding into the village
behind the flying horse.</p>

<p>Mr. Grimsby's principal grief seemed to be that Bud himself had
not shared the fate of the wagon, and he did not hesitate to so
express himself.</p>

<p>"The damages won't be a cent less than a hundred dollars," added
the angry keeper of the livery stable.</p>

<p>"Will you call it square for that?" asked Bud, looking at the
man, who was leaning against the post in front of him.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I will?"</p>

<p>"Very well; write out a receipt in full and sign it and I'll
pay it."</p>

<p>Mr. Grimsby scanned him curiously for a minute, and then said:</p>

<p>"If you're in earnest come over to my office."</p>

<p>Bud got up and followed him into his little dingy office, where
he kept a record of his humble livery business, and after considerable
fumbling with his oil-lamp, found pen and paper and the receipt
was written and signed.</p>

<p>While he was thus employed Bud Heyland had counted one hundred
dollars in ten-dollar bills, which he passed over to Mr. Grimsby,
who, as was his custom, counted them over several times.</p>

<p>As he did so he noticed that they were crisp, new bills, and
looked as if they were in circulation for the first time.</p>

<p>He carefully folded them up and put them away in his wallet with
a grim smile, such as is apt to be shown by a man of that character
when he thinks he has got the better of a friend in a bargain
or trade.</p>

<p>And as Bud Heyland walked out he smiled, too, in a very meaning
way.</p>
