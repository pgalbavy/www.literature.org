<p>One recourse was before the pursuing Sioux from the start: that
was to shoot the horses of the fugitives. The wonder was that
they had not aimed to do so from the first. With the couple dismounted,
they would be at their mercy.</p>

<p>It was the fear of this that caused Warren to ask his friend
to draw up as near to him as he could. It was not likely that
both ponies would fall at once, and the survivor might be able
to carry the couple to safety.</p>

<p>"I tell ye we are gaining," said the Irishman, with far more
hope in his manner than Warren thought was warranted.</p>

<p>"We must gain a good deal before getting out of the woods," was
the reply of the other, who devoted every energy to forcing his
animal to his best pace.</p>

<p>"Look out! they're going to shoot again," said Tim.</p>

<p>Throwing himself forward, Warren hugged his pony closer than
ever, his companion doing the same, instead of trying to use his
gun. The volley came while the words were in course of utterance,
but neither of the youths was touched. The Sioux must have found
it equally hard to fire with their animals on a full run.</p>

<p>"Why don't the spalpeens save their powder?" was the disgusted
question of Tim, but his feelings changed a minute later, when
his own pony showed by his actions that he had been hit hard.
He uttered a low, moaning cry, and staggered as if about to fall.</p>

<p>Warren was the first to notice it.</p>

<p>"Tim, Billy is going to drop; ride closer and mount Jack behind
me."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! I'll see you hanged first," was the characteristic
reply of the brave fellow, who sturdily refused to heed the urgent
appeal of his friend.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Jack can't carry us both."</p>

<p>"He can until we reach the ridge."</p>

<p>"But we're not going toward it," insisted Tim, too observant
to be deceived.</p>

<p>"Turn Billy's head that way," said Warren, growing desperate
in the imminence of the peril, and swerving his pony to the right;
"Jack can carry us both as well as one."</p>

<p>Still the Irishman hesitated. It might be as his companion said,
but he was unwilling to imperil Warren, and destroy the chances
of both, when everything looked so favorable for one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the stricken Billy was fast giving out. He struggled
gamely, but it was evident that he must quickly succumb. At the
most, he could go but a short distance farther.</p>

<p>The Sioux fired again, but nothing was accomplished. If Jack
was hit, he did not show it during the few seconds that his rider
held his breath.</p>

<p>Still Tim held back in the face of the pleadings of his friend.
Two discoveries, however, led him to yield.</p>

<p>They were now heading straight for the ridge, which was barely
half a mile distant. It must soon be attained, unless something
happened to Jack. The foremost Sioux had fallen so perceptibly
behind that there was reason to believe the horse could carry
both riders to safety, or rather to the refuge which they hoped
to find at the base of the ridge.</p>

<p>"I'll do the same, being it's yerself that asks it&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Quick! Billy is falling!" called Warren, far more excited than
his companion.</p>

<p>The crisis had come. The poor animal could go no farther, and
was swaying from side to side like a drunken person, certain to
fall with the next minute.</p>

<p>Tim released his foot from the stirrup on his right, swung his
leg over the saddle, as only a skilful horseman can do, and, holding
his gun with one hand, grasped the outstretched one of Warren
and made a slight leap, which landed him behind him.</p>

<p>It was a delicate and difficult task, and despite the skill with
which it was executed, both came within a hair of tumbling headlong
to the ground.</p>

<p>Quickly as it was done, it was not a moment too soon. The mortally
wounded Billy suddenly went forward, his nose ploughing up the
snow and earth, and after a few struggles all was over.</p>

<p>The action had not only increased the danger of both of the fugitives,
but it rendered the situation of the Irishman doubly perilous.
Although both leaned forward, they could not do so as effectually
as when each was on his own horse, and Tim of necessity was the
more exposed of the two.</p>

<p>Leaving Warren to guide and urge Jack, he gave his attention
to the Sioux, who did not relax their efforts, but whose relative
situations, owing to the varying speed of their horses, underwent
a curious change of position.</p>

<p>Two were riding abreast, and so far as Tim could see there was
not the least difference in the speed of their ponies. Behind
them at a distance of several rods came two others, holding precisely
the same relative positions, while the rest were strung along
over the prairie, until it looked as if the hindmost was a third
of a mile distant.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be feared from them, but what of those that were
so much nearer?</p>

<p>That was the vital question that must soon be answered.</p>

<p>While the position of the Irishman was anything but pleasant,
and with the horse on a jump he was required to take the utmost
care to maintain his seat, he decided to try his gun once more.</p>

<p>This proved harder than he supposed. He could make no use of
the saddle in which young Starr sat, and when he sought to turn
he would have fallen, had he not kept one arm about the waist
of his friend. And yet, in the face of all this, he managed to
get his Winchester in position with the muzzle toward the leading
Sioux.</p>

<p>Anything like aiming the weapon was out of the question, and
it would have been folly to expect that a second chance shot would
favor him. Nevertheless, the demonstration accomplished something
unexpected. He had done execution with one shot, and when the
bucks saw the muzzle pointing backward, they were scared.</p>

<p>The leaders naturally supposed they were the ones intended to
serve as targets, and they ducked their heads with such suddenness
that the Irishman grinned. Not only that, but one of them caused
his pony&mdash;probably through some inadvertent act on the part of
the rider&mdash;to swerve from his course, thereby interfering with
those immediately in the rear.</p>

<p>Even the companion at his side was thrown somewhat out of "plumb,"
and lost a few paces, much to the delight of Tim, who gleefully
told Warren of what had taken place.</p>

<p>The advantage to the fugitives will be understood when it is
remembered that they were rapidly drawing near the ridge, now
at no great distance in front.</p>

<p>True, there was no certainty that it would prove a refuge to
them, if attained; but it would be more of a shelter than the
open prairie, where, if driven to bay, there was not the slightest
protection against the bullets of the Sioux, unless the body of
Jack should be used as a breastwork.</p>

<p>The confusion of the bucks was only temporary. They needed no
one to tell them what the aim of the youths was when they changed
the line of their flight, nor could they fail to see that the
ridge would be attained quite soon, unless they were checked.</p>

<p>Tim Brophy suspected that such thoughts were passing through
their minds, and despite the hopelessness of the effort, he discharged
his rifle toward them; and when it is stated that it was discharged
"toward them," no more can be said. There is no reason to believe
that he came within twenty feet of hitting any one of the Sioux.</p>

<p>It may be doubted, therefore, whether this essay on his part
was beneficial to himself and companion, inasmuch as it must have
lowered their opinion of his marksmanship and convinced the red
men that they were altogether mistaken in giving heed to any more
shots fired by him from the back of the pony, which was not only
going at full speed, but was carrying a double burden.</p>
