<p> <em>THERE </em>is no part of the world of coasts, continents,
oceans, seas, straits, capes, and islands which is not under the
sway of a reigning wind, the sovereign of its typical weather. 
The wind rules the aspects of the sky and the action of the sea. 
But no wind rules unchallenged his realm of land and water.  As
with the kingdoms of the earth, there are regions more turbulent
than others.  In the middle belt of the earth the Trade Winds
reign supreme, undisputed, like monarchs of long-settled kingdoms,
whose traditional power, checking all undue ambitions, is not
so much an exercise of personal might as the working of long-established
institutions.  The intertropical kingdoms of the Trade Winds are
favourable to the ordinary life of a merchantman.  The trumpet-call
of strife is seldom borne on their wings to the watchful ears
of men on the decks of ships.  The regions ruled by the north-east
and south-east Trade Winds are serene.  In a southern-going ship,
bound out for a long voyage, the passage through their dominions
is characterized by a relaxation of strain and vigilance on the
part of the seamen.  Those citizens of the ocean feel sheltered
under the ægis of an uncontested law, of an undisputed dynasty. 
There, indeed, if anywhere on earth, the weather may be trusted.</p>

<p>Yet not too implicitly.  Even in the constitutional realm of
Trade Winds, north and south of the equator, ships are overtaken
by strange disturbances.  Still, the easterly winds, and, generally
speaking, the easterly weather all the world over, is characterized
by regularity and persistence.</p>

<p>As a ruler, the East Wind has a remarkable stability; as an invader
of the high latitudes lying under the tumultuous sway of his great
brother, the Wind of the West, he is extremely difficult to dislodge,
by the reason of his cold craftiness and profound duplicity.</p>

<p>The narrow seas around these isles, where British admirals keep
watch and ward upon the marches of the Atlantic Ocean, are subject
to the turbulent sway of the West Wind.  Call it north-west or
south-west, it is all one—a different phase of the same character,
a changed expression on the same face.  In the orientation of
the winds that rule the seas, the north and south directions are
of no importance.  There are no North and South Winds of any account
upon this earth.  The North and South Winds are but small princes
in the dynasties that make peace and war upon the sea. They never
assert themselves upon a vast stage.  They depend upon local causes—the
configuration of coasts, the shapes of straits, the accidents
of bold promontories round which they play their little part. 
In the polity of winds, as amongst the tribes of the earth, the
real struggle lies between East and West.</p>
