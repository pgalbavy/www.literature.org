<p>The influence of a familiar and sequestered place is not only
soothing; the bruised mind may often find it restorative. Thus
Hedrick, in his studio, surrounded by his own loved bric-a-brac,
began to feel once more the stir of impulse. Two hours' reading
inspired him. What a French reporter (in the Count's bedroom)
could do, an American youth in full possession of his powers&mdash;except
for a strained knee and other injuries&mdash;could do. Yes, and would!</p>

<p>He evolved a new chain of reasoning. The ledger had been seen
in Laura's room; it had been heard in her room; it appeared to
be kept in her room. But it was in no single part of the room.
All the parts make a whole. Therefore, the book was not in the
room.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Laura had not left the room when she took
the book from its hiding-place. This was confusing; therefore
he determined to concentrate logic solely upon what she had done
with the ledger when she finished writing in it. It was dangerous
to assume that she had restored it to the place whence she obtained
it, because he had already proved that place to be both in the
room and out of the room. No; the question he must keep in was:
What did she do with it?</p>

<p>Laura had not left the room. But the book had left the room.</p>

<p>Arrived at this inevitable deduction, he sprang to his feet in
a state of repressed excitement and began to pace the floor&mdash;like
a hound on the trail. Laura had not left the room, but the book
had left the room: he must keep his mind upon this point. He uttered
a loud exclamation and struck the zinc table-top a smart blow
with his clenched fist.</p>

<p>Laura had thrown the book out of the window!</p>

<p>In the exaltation of this triumph, he forgot that it was not
yet the hour for a scholar's reappearance, and went forth in haste
to search the ground beneath the window&mdash;a disappointing quest,
for nowhere in the yard was there anything but withered grass,
and the rubbish of other frost-bitten vegetation. His mother,
however, discovered something else, and, opening the kitchen window,
she asked, with surprise:</p>

<p>"Why, Hedrick, what on earth are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Me?" inquired Hedrick.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Here?" Evidently she puzzled him.</p>

<p>She became emphatic. "I want to know what you are doing."</p>

<p>"Just standing here," he explained in a meek, grieved way.</p>

<p>"But why aren't you at school?"</p>

<p>This recalled what he had forgotten, and he realized the insecurity
of his position. "Oh, yes," he said&mdash;"school. Did you ask me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Didn't you go to school?"</p>

<p>He began to speak rapidly. "Didn't I go to <em>school</em>? Well,
where else could I go? Just because I'm here now doesn't mean
I didn't <em>go</em>, does it? Because a person is in China right
now wouldn't have to mean he'd never been in South America, would
it?"</p>

<p>"Then what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was going along, and you know I didn't feel very well
and&#11834;" He paused, with the advent of a happier idea, then continued
briskly: "But that didn't stop me, because I thought I ought to
go if I dropped, so I went ahead, but the teacher was sick and
they couldn't get a substitute. She must have been pretty sick,
she looked so pale&#11834;"</p>

<p>"They dismissed the class?"</p>

<p>"And I don't have to go to-morrow either."</p>

<p>"I see," said his mother. "But if you feel ill, Hedrick, hadn't
you better come in and lie down?"</p>

<p>"I think it's kind of passing off. The fresh air seems to be
doing me good."</p>

<p>"Be careful of your sore knee, dear." She closed the window,
and he was left to continue his operations in safety.</p>

<p>Laura had thrown the ledger out of the window; that was proved
absolutely. Obviously, she had come down before daylight and retrieved
it. Or, she had not. Proceeding on the assumption that she had
not, he lifted his eyes and searched the air. Was it possible
that the book, though thrown from the window, had never reached
the ground? The branches of an old and stalwart maple, now almost
divested of leaves, extended in rough symmetry above him, and
one big limb, reaching out toward the house, came close to Laura's
windows. Triumph shown again from the shrewd countenance of the
sleuth: Laura must have slid the ledger along a wire into a hollow
branch. However, no wire was to be seen&mdash;and the shrewd countenance
of the sleuth fell. But perhaps she had constructed a device of
silk threads, invisible from below, which carried the book into
the tree. Action!</p>

<p>He climbed carefully but with many twinges, finally pausing in
a parlous situation not far from the mysterious window which Laura
had opened the night before. A comprehensive survey of the tree
revealed only the very patent fact that none of the branches was
of sufficient diameter to conceal the ledger. No silk threads
came from the window. He looked and looked and looked at that
window; then his eye fell a little, halted less than three feet
below the window-ledge, and the search was ended.</p>

<p>The kitchen window which his mother had opened was directly beneath
Laura's, and was a very long, narrow window, in the style of the
house, and there was a protecting stone ledge above it. Upon this
ledge lay the book, wrapped in its oil-skin covering and secured
from falling by a piece of broken iron hooping, stuck in the mortar
of the bricks. It could be seen from nowhere save an upper window
of the house next door, or from the tree itself, and in either
case only when the leaves had fallen.</p>

<p>Laura had felt very safe. No one had ever seen the book except
that night, early in August, when, for a better circulation of
air, she had left her door open as she wrote, and Hedrick had
come upon her. He had not spoken of it again; she perceived that
he had forgotten it; and she herself forgot that the memory of
a boy is never to be depended on; its forgettings are too seldom
permanent in the case of things that ought to stay forgotten.</p>

<p>To get the book one had only to lean from the window.</p>

<p>Hedrick seemed so ill during lunch that his mother spoke of asking
Doctor Sloane to look at him, if he did not improve before evening.
Hedrick said meekly that perhaps that would be best&mdash;if he did
not improve. After a futile attempt to eat, he courteously excused
himself from the table&mdash;a ceremony which made even Cora fear that
his case might be serious&mdash;and, going feebly to the library, stretched
himself upon the sofa. His mother put a rug over him; Hedrick,
thanking her touchingly, closed his eyes; and she went away, leaving
him to slumber.</p>

<p>After a time, Laura came into the room on an errand, walking
noiselessly, and, noticing that his eyes were open, apologized
for waking him.</p>

<p>"Never mind," he returned, in the tone of an invalid. "I didn't
sleep sound. I think there's something the matter inside my head:
I have such terrible dreams. I guess maybe it's better for me
to keep awake. I'm kind of afraid to go to sleep. Would you mind
staying here with me a little while?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I'll stay," she said, and, observing that his cheeks
were flushed, and his eyes unusually bright, she laid a cool hand
on his forehead. "You haven't any fever, dear; that's good. You'll
be all right to-morrow. Would you like me to read to you?"</p>

<p>"I believe," he answered, plaintively, "reading might kind of
disturb my mind: my brain feels so sort of restless and queer.
I'd rather play some kind of game."</p>

<p>"Cards?"</p>

<p>"No, not cards exactly. Something' I can do lying down. Oh, I
know! You remember the one where we drew pictures and the others
had to guess what they were? Well, I've invented a game like that.
You sit down at the desk over there and take some sheets of paper.
I'll tell you the rest."</p>

<p>She obeyed. "What next?"</p>

<p>"Now, I'll describe some people and where they live and not tell
who they are, and you see if you can guess their names and addresses."</p>

<p>"Addresses, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, because I'm going to describe the way their houses look.
Write each name on a separate sheet of paper, and the number of
their house below it if you know it, and if you don't know it,
just the street. If it's a woman: put `Miss' or `Mrs.' before
their name and if it's a man write `Esquire' after it."</p>

<p>"Is all that necessary for the game?"</p>

<p>"It's the way I invented it and I think you might&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," she acquiesced, good-naturedly. "It shall be
according to your rules."</p>

<p>"Then afterward, you give me the sheets of paper with the names
and addresses written on 'em, and we&mdash;we&#11834;" He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes. What do we do then?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when we come to it." But when that stage of his
invention was reached, and Laura had placed the inscribed sheets
in his hand, his interest had waned, it appeared. Also, his condition
had improved.</p>

<p>"Let's quit. I thought this game would be more exciting," he
said, sitting up. "I guess," he added with too much modesty, "I'm
not very good at inventing games. I b'lieve I'll go out to the
barn; I think the fresh air&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you feel well enough to go out?" she asked. "You do seem
to be all right, though."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm a lot better, I think." He limped to the door. "The
fresh air will be the best thing for me."</p>

<p>She did not notice that he carelessly retained her contributions
to the game, and he reached his studio with them in his hand.
Hedrick had entered the 'teens and he was a reader: things in
his head might have dismayed a Borgia.</p>

<p>No remotest glimpse entered that head of the enormity of what
he did. To put an end to his punishing of Cora, and, to render
him powerless against that habitual and natural enemy, Laura had
revealed a horrible incident in his career&mdash;it had become a public
scandal; he was the sport of fools; and it might be months before
the thing was lived down. Now he had the means, as he believed,
to even the score with both sisters at a stroke. To him it was
turning a tremendous and properly scathing joke upon them. He
did not hesitate.</p>

<p>That evening, as Richard Lindley sat at dinner with his mother,
Joe Varden temporarily abandoned his attendance at the table to
answer the front doorbell. Upon his return, he remarked:</p>

<p>"Messenger-boy mus' been in big hurry. Wouldn' wait till I git
to door."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Richard.</p>

<p>"Boy with package. Least, I reckon it were a boy. Call' back
from the front walk, say he couldn' wait. Say he lef' package
in vestibule."</p>

<p>"What sort of a package?"</p>

<p>"Middle-size kind o' big package."</p>

<p>"Why don't you see what it is, Richard?" Mrs. Lindley asked of
her son. "Bring it to the table, Joe."</p>

<p>When it was brought, Richard looked at the superscription with
surprise. The wrapper was of heavy brown paper, and upon it a
sheet of white notepaper had been pasted, with the address:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Richard Lindley, Esq.,<br/>
1218 Corliss Street."

</p>
</div>
<p>"It's from Laura Madison," he said, staring at this writing.
"What in the world would Laura be sending me?"</p>

<p>"You might possibly learn by opening it," suggested his mother.
"I've seen men puzzle over the outside of things quite as often
as women. Laura Madison is a nice girl." She never volunteered
similar praise of Laura Madison's sister. Mrs. Lindley had submitted
to her son's plans concerning Cora, lately confided; but her submission
lacked resignation.</p>

<p>"It's a book," said Richard, even more puzzled, as he took the
ledger from its wrappings. "Two little torn places at the edge
of the covers. Looks as if it had once had clasps&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's the Madison family album," Mrs. Lindley suggested.
"Pictures of Cora since infancy. I imagine she's had plenty taken."</p>

<p>"No." He opened the book and glanced at the pages covered in
Laura's clear, readable hand. "No, it's about half full of writing.
Laura must have turned literary." He read a line or two, frowning
mildly. "My soul! I believe it's a novel! She must think I'm a
critic&mdash;to want me to read it." Smiling at the idea, he closed
the ledger. "I'll take it upstairs to my hang-out after dinner,
and see if Laura's literary manner has my august approval. Who
in the world would ever have thought she'd decide to set up for
a writer?"</p>

<p>"I imagine she might have something to write worth reading,"
said his mother. "I've always thought she was an interesting-looking
girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is. She dances well, too."</p>

<p>"Of course," continued Mrs. Lindley, thoughtfully, "she seldom
<em>says</em> anything interesting, but that may be because she
so seldom has a chance to say anything at all."</p>

<p>Richard refused to perceive this allusion. "Curious that Laura
should have sent it to me," he said. "She's never seemed interested
in my opinion about anything. I don't recall her ever speaking
to me on any subject whatever&mdash;except one."</p>

<p>He returned his attention to his plate, but his mother did not
appear to agree with him that the topic was exhausted.</p>

<p>"`Except one'?" she repeated, after waiting for some time.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, in his habitual preoccupied and casual tone.
"Or perhaps two. Not more than two, I should say&mdash;and in a way
you'd call that only one, of course. Bread, Joe."</p>

<p>"What two, Richard?"</p>

<p>"Cora," he said, with gentle simplicity, "and me."</p>
