<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Newt Spooner was gone a week, though he had only announced it as his
purpose to escort the girl as far as a near-by village.
</p>
<p>In three days more, according to the articles of war, his name must be
dropped from the company roll, and his status become that of death or
desertion. Even if he came back at once, he must face the lesser charge
of absence beyond leave.
</p><p>When the sergeant did return, he bore the marks of jungle travel, and as
he reported to his company commander, his face indicated that his
explanation would not be merely personal.
</p><p>Yet Sergeant Spooner was secretive, and asked permission to guide a
small force into the hills. He said that he had come upon evidence which
would not wait, and he had, therefore, taken the liberty of following it
up independently. He believed he could lead a detachment to a place
where a party of insurgents were in hiding, and--at this his captain sat
up and took notice--although it was a small party, he had information
which led him to believe the renegade might be one of the number.
</p><p>But for such an enterprise Newton Spooner's superiors required no
urging. The sergeant said that no considerable force could hope to reach
the place unheralded, so two picked squads stole out that same evening,
and before dawn of the third day (for they marched only at night and lay
hidden while the sun shone) were creeping through the long grass upon a
native farm where two nipa houses proclaimed the presence of humanity.
They crept cautiously, for though the place had all the seeming of
private and peaceful domiciles, they had learned to distrust appearances
and to trust Sergeant Newt Spooner's judgment. The spot was very wild
and desolate, lying remote from any village. In the gray mists between
night and morning it seemed a land of ghosts, with broken hills and
jungle closing about it.
</p><p>As daylight crept to the east, soldiers stood silent and patient at each
door and window of each house. It was a strange disposition of troops
about thatched houses that lay soundless and wrapped in profound
slumber. The lieutenant who had come in command stood at the right of
the front door of the larger house, and over against him, on the left,
stood Newt Spooner. But each stood with back pressed to wall, so
flattened against the uprights that, in that dim light, one coming out
of the door would pass them by unseeing. And at each of the other
openings the watchers were likewise flattened as though they had been
figures in bas-relief fantastically wrought by the builder.
</p><p>They stood without sound or movement, until, as the light strengthened a
little, the door opened and a <u>mestiza</u> girl in slippered feet and
partial attire came out, carrying an earthen water-vessel. As she
crossed the threshold, looking neither to right nor left, New Spooner's
tight-pressed palm shot out and silenced her carmine lips. The officer
recognized the girl. He had himself recently turned away unable to watch
her sobs for her dead lover, and now he felt an impulse to resent this
rough indignity at the hands of the sergeant. But something in the
sergeant's face gave him pause, and at the same moment Newt Spooner
sternly whispered to his prisoner in Spanish:
</p><p>"Call him--call him, I tell you!"
</p><p>For an instant, the girl stood trembling from head to foot, with dumb
agony in her eyes. It was evident that she was facing the hardest crisis
of her life, and that terror was dominant. As Newt bent forward with
threatening hardness in his relentless face, she shrank back against the
wall, bowing her head in forced assent, and with the soldier's strong
hand still close enough to stifle any unwished-for outcry, she called in
quavering, heart-broken Spanish:
</p><p>"Beloved, come to me. Come <u>pronto</u>!"
</p><p>There followed, at once, a sound of bare feet from inside, and a
gigantic, half-clad figure appeared anxiously at the door. It was the
figure of a white man; and, as the lieutenant caught its shoulder, and
threw his revolver muzzle to its broad chest, he found himself looking
into the grave eyes of former Sergeant-Major Peter Spooner, late of the
26th Volunteers.
</p><p>For an instant, the officer stood too dazed to credit the testimony of
his eyes, but, while the Deacon glanced down the barrel of Newt's
leveled rifle, and shrugged his shoulders with a low oath, the officer
realized that he had under his hand the mysterious renegade.
</p><p>And then, as the deserter, still gazing into the flinty face of his
kinsman, raised his hands in surrender, he coolly turned toward the
house, and shouted back in excellent Spanish:
</p><p>"General, we are captives. Resistance is useless."
</p><p>In answer to that message, there shortly appeared, framed in the door,
the startled countenance of the notorious Rosario himself. Once too
often, he had trusted himself with those inconsiderable escorts which
had enabled him to pass from place to place without attracting
attention.
</p><p>The detail made its march back to headquarters, taking its prisoners
with it, in a semi-dazed condition. Against Rosario they felt little
vindictiveness, now that he was captive to their arms. But this other,
this sergeant-major who had organized most of them into soldiery back
there in the Appalachian hills, with him there was a ghastly difference.
He had been a hero, mourned as lost. He had taken the pay of the service
and held its highest warrant--and he had been false to his salt, for
those tin bars which they roughly stripped from his shoulders.
</p><p>But, if the command was struck sick with astonishment, Black Pete
himself treated them to no show of emotion. He had already considered
and weighed what it meant to desert to the enemy in time of war, and he
had been taken in attendance upon the enemy's district leader, wearing
the enemy's livery. He was already, in effect, dead, and he meant to
maintain the stolid silence of death.
</p><p>And so the detachment marched into headquarters with the grim silence of
a funeral cortège, though as yet the corpse walked upright and on its
own feet.
</p><p>No lips were tighter set, and no face more stonily expressionless than
that of Sergeant Newton Spooner. His was the capture, his the
credit--and, in part, the shame. Between himself and the man who must
hang existed the bond of one blood and one name. The smirch upon the
regiment was likewise a smirch upon that blood and name.
</p><p>The struggle in himself had begun from the moment when he found the
print of a large boot in the mud, and the disgrace to the service and
the regiment had come home to him ... the one form of disgrace which he
had ever understood. But the mental sweat was not yet over. It must have
its ugly culmination at general court-martial, and when that time came
he, Newt Spooner, must say the words upon which conviction would
indubitably follow. He knew that in its hideous fulness, had known it
from the start, and yet, when the hour came and he took the stand to
testify, no voice could have been steadier, and no gaze more unflinching
than that with which he held the eyes of the accused.
</p><p>But the gaze with which the Deacon met his was in no wise weaker. As
Black Pete listened to the proceedings in which his life-sands were
running out, his eyes were thoughtful and perhaps a shade wistful, but
undrooping, and unwavering.
</p><p>The defendant testified that, when he was captured, they offered him
choice between death and a captain's commission. He had chosen the
latter. They took him north, and he had talked with Aguinaldo in person.
The "President" had received him as an officer and a dignitary. He had
beguiled him with hopes of foreign recognition and a filmy vision of
ultimate success. The Deacon had held during his life one goal and one
ideal. His dream was leadership. He had tired of the warrant of the
"non-com." He wished to sit in council with men of higher rank. The
experiment had failed. He made no plea.
</p><p>The hearing before G.C.M. came after the regiment had left the town with
the church. It was on a larger parade ground that the united battalions
were drawn up at sunset, and the regimental adjutant stepped a pace
forward to the colonel's side and "published the order," which announced
that Peter Spooner was "to be hanged by his neck till dead."
</p><p>The lines stood silent as the adjutant's words were read. Black Pete at
"the front and center," to be seen of all men, presented a picture quite
as uncompromising as he had ever presented before. His contemplative
gray eyes bore straight to the front as he stood at attention, and in
them slept a thoughtful expression, as though they were looking off
beyond horizons hidden to other men, and already piercing the opaque
things of life and death.
</p><p>And Newt Spooner gave his company front a motionless, sternly impersonal
figure upon which to gaze. In neither condemned nor informer was there a
vestige of tremor as the officers came to the "front and center" and the
formation ended.
</p><p>In the wet mists of a rainy morning, they escorted Black Pete to a
scaffold around which ranged, in hollow square, the regiment he had
betrayed--and there they hanged him high as Haman. Brooding hills looked
down, rain-shrouded, and to their crests at the last moment the
condemned man raised his eyes.
</p><p>There was silence, save for the pelting of rain on iron roofs, until it
was broken by noise of the falling trap and the low whip-like snap of
the tautened rope. Then the burial detail went out and did its work.
Sergeant Newton Spooner returned to his routine duties with a grim
taciturnity which did not invite conversation.
</p><hr/>
<p>It was at Manila, many months later, that Major Henry Falkins again
called Sergeant Spooner to battalion headquarters, and spoke with a
certain embarrassment:
</p><p>"Spooner," he inquired slowly, "have you come to realize that one man
may bear testimony against another for reasons other than spite?"
</p><p>A slow flush, brick-red and hot, spread over the bronzed face of the
non-commissioned officer.
</p><p>"I've come to understand a good many things, sir," he replied gravely.
"And I've paid for learning them."
</p><p>"We'll be mustered out before long," suggested Henry Falkins, "but I
won't be long out of uniform, I hope. I'm going to stay in the service.
Once I promised you a chance--"
</p><p>Newt Spooner grinned.
</p><p>"I reckon the uniform's good enough for me, too, sir," he interrupted.
Then he added, with a diffidence which all expression of deep feeling
brings to the mountaineer: "I reckon, sir, as long as I can serve under
you I'll go on reënlisting."
</p><p>Falkins was a mountaineer, too. He hastily changed the subject.
</p><p>"Commissions from the ranks are going to men less capable than you--but
examinations must be passed. If you'll study, Spooner, I'd like to get
behind you and help."
</p><p>"I've never spoken of that to any man, sir, but I've been thinking about
it," announced the sergeant diffidently. "I've been studying for
eighteen months."
</p><hr/>
<p>Not far from the corner of Main and Limestone Streets in Lexington,
Kentucky, and almost in the shadow of the Phoenix Hotel, a poster on the
sidewalk and a flag from an overhead window proclaimed that "Men were
wanted for the United States Army." Out of the door of the building so
decorated, one spring morning, when the trees were in delicate new
leafage, came a sergeant attached to the recruiting station. He was
selected, as many of these men are, for his soldierliness of appearance.
Such men are the best advertisement the service can use, and it uses
them.
</p><p>The sergeant was not overly tall, and, though spare, he was by no means
lean. His shoulders swung back squarely, and his chest, rounded and
strong like a barrel, bore on its olive-drab blouse a sharp-shooter's
cross and the Medal of Honor, which must be bestowed by an Act of
Congress.
</p><p>His face was clear-cut and bronzed by tropic sun and ocean winds. In
fine, as the sergeant walked to the corner, casting his eyes up and down
Limestone Street, he was an inspiriting figure of a man--and a soldier
man. He had for the time nothing better to do than to stroll, and as he
strolled a flicker of reminiscent amusement brought a pleasant grin to
his firm lips. Sergeant Newt Spooner was thinking of the black-clad,
lowering-faced boy who years ago hiked through this town, bent on
assassination.
</p><p>As he went along the historic street, where every square held traditions
of ante-bellum days, he began to encounter other strollers, college lads
in sweaters and caps, and college girls with books. But his eyes finally
focused their gaze on a young woman who came out of a house and also
turned up the street, walking ahead of him. She was a slim girl in
simple gingham, but in her cheeks was an apple-blossom glow and
delicacy, and her movements were informed with the lithe grace of
out-of-doors. Newt wanted to overtake and accost her. He wanted to see
if she would recognize him, changed as he was, as quickly as he had
recognized her, who was even more changed.
</p><p>For this girl looked like some splendid young blossom that had come to
flower in open woods, and the soldier saw, with mingled pride and
twinging jealousy, that all the boys and men who passed took off their
hats with frank ardor in their eyes. This was such a metamorphosed
Minerva that he fell into shyness and delayed announcing himself until
they had reached the stone gate-posts of the rolling campus, where,
under the maples, the macadam road wound up to the college buildings,
and the old field-gun of civil-war days looked out over the cadets'
drill-ground.
</p><p>There he plucked up courage to call in a low voice, "M'nervy!" and at
the mountain pronunciation, coming unexpectedly from behind, the girl
wheeled and stood for a moment, confronting him in a pretty picture of
delight and astonishment, while a warm color stole into her cheeks.
</p><p>"Newty!" she cried, as she held out both hands in greeting. "Where in
the world did you spring from?"
</p><p>They stood there under the maples for a while, and the boy made her talk
of herself, and, while they talked, a man, wearing the uniform of a
lieutenant of infantry, came down the walk. He was a likeable-looking
fellow, well set-up and soldierly, but very young. From his campaign hat
to his polished puttees, he was new, new like the lately minted coin
that has not long circulated. Lieutenant March was not long from the
"Point," and he was at present stationed here as Commandant at the
University. The sergeant, with his back turned that way, was deep in
conversation with the girl, so that, as he heard a pleasant voice
saying, "How are you, Miss Rawlins," he turned just in time to see the
officer's lifted hat, and to catch the smile on his lips. But his
soldier instinct was now second nature, and in the same glance he saw
the "U.S.A." of the collar-ornaments.
</p><p>At once, Sergeant Newt Spooner stood at attention, his heels together
and his hand at his hat-brim in salute. The officer, too, was taking in
those things which military men observe. He saw the service stripes and
the two medals on the breast, and his eyes brightened. As he returned
the salute he cheerily inquired:
</p><p>"What command, sergeant?"
</p><p>"Fifty-ninth Infantry, sir; late of the 26th Volunteers."
</p><p>"Here on leave?"
</p><p>"Recruiting detail, sir."
</p><p>The officer's eyes were dwelling on the decorated breast.
</p><p>"Medal of Honor man," he said. "What service was that, sergeant?"
</p><p>The girl, whose less-trained eyes had not recognized the import of the
little metal disc, flushed with pleasure. Newt flushed, too. It irked
him to talk about himself; but the military ethics were ingrained, and
he still stood upright, and answered respectfully, but as briefly as
possible:
</p><p>"The islands, sir. Province of Nueva Ecija." When the lieutenant had
gone, the sergeant looked down in an embarrassed fashion at the white
road.
</p><p>"Minerva," he said, "I don't know whether it interests you, but I'm
studying pretty hard myself. That's why I asked for this detail. That
and one other reason. I'm only a non-commissioned officer, and you're
almost a school-teacher. I'm on the wrong side of the line, but I've
applied for an examination, and, when this term of enlistment is up I've
got a good chance of a commission." He saw her looking at his medal, and
heard her saying:
</p><p>"I should think you would have, Newty."
</p><p>"Oh," he hastened to tell her, "I mean that I've got an influential
friend, who's going to help me."
</p><p>"Who is that, Newty?" she demanded; and, as he answered, the young
sergeant flushed.
</p><p>"The best soldier in the service, Colonel Henry Falkins."
</p><p>The girl looked down at the pavement and then up at the tender green of
the maples. Her only reply was a low, "Oh!" but her voice said more, and
presently she added a question:
</p><p>"You said, Newty--" her eyes now held a challenging twinkle as she
spoke--"that there was one other reason why you asked for this--what do
you call it?--oh, yes, I know, this detail. What was that reason?"
</p><p>The sergeant raised his face, and held her eyes with a steady gaze,
until her own eyes fell, and her cheeks grew more rosy.
</p><p>"That reason," he announced boldly, "is that I want plenty of chance to
tell you what the reason is."
