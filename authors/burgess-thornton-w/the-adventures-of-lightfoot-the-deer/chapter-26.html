<p>All the rest of that day the hunter with the terrible gun lay
hidden in the bushes of the pasture where he could watch for Lightfoot
the Deer to leave the place of safety he had found. It required
a lot of patience on the part of the hunter, but the hunter had
plenty of patience. It sometimes seems as if hunters have more
patience than any other people.</p>

<p>But this hunter waited in vain. Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun sank
down in the west to his bed behind the Purple Hills. The Black
Shadows crept out and grew blacker. One by one the stars began
to twinkle. Still the hunter waited, and still there was no sign
of Lightfoot. At last it became so dark that it was useless for
the hunter to remain longer. Disappointed and once more becoming
angry, he tramped back to the Big River, climbed into his boat
and rowed across to the other side. Then he tramped home and his
thoughts were very bitter. He knew that he could have shot Lightfoot
had it not been for the man who had protected the Deer. He even
began to suspect that this man had himself killed Lightfoot, for
he had been sure that as soon as he had become rested Lightfoot
would start for the woods, and Lightfoot had done nothing of the
kind. In fact, the hunter had not had so much as another glimpse
of Lightfoot.</p>

<p>The reason that the hunter had been so disappointed was that
Lightfoot was smart. He was smart enough to understand that the
man who was saving him from the hunter had done it because he
was a true friend. All the afternoon Lightfoot had rested on a
bed of soft hay in an open shed and had watched this man going
about his work and taking the utmost care to do nothing to frighten
Lightfoot.</p>

<p>"He not only will let no one else harm me, but he himself will
not harm me," thought Lightfoot. "As long as he is near, I am
safe. I'll stay right around here until the hunting season is
over, then I'll swim back across the Big River to my home in the
dear Green Forest."</p>

<p>So all afternoon Lightfoot rested and did not so much as put
his nose outside that open shed. That is why the hunter got no
glimpse of him. When it became dark, so dark that he knew there
was no longer danger, Lightfoot got up and stepped out under the
stars. He was feeling quite himself again. His splendid strength
had returned. He bounded lightly across the meadow and up into
the brushy pasture where the hunter had been hidden. There and
in the woods back of the pasture he browsed, but at the first
hint of the coming of another day, Lightfoot turned back, and
when his friend, the farmer, came out early in the morning to
milk the cows, there was Lightfoot back in the open shed. The
farmer smiled. "You are as wise as you are handsome, old fellow,"
said he.</p>
