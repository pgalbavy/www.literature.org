<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>FOR three months Billy met has-beens, and third- and fourth-rate
fighters from New York and its environs. He thrashed them all--usually
by the knockout route and finally local sports commenced talking about
him a bit, and he was matched up with second-raters from other cities.
</p>
<p>These men he cleaned up as handily as he had the others, so that it was
apparent to fight fandom that the big, quiet “unknown” was a comer;
and pretty soon Professor Cassidy received an offer from another
trainer-manager to match Billy against a real “hope” who stood in the
forefront of hopedom.
</p><p>This other manager stated that he thought the mill would prove excellent
practice for his man who was having difficulty in finding opponents.
Professor Cassidy thought so too, and grinned for two hours straight
after reading the challenge.
</p><p>The details of the fight were quickly arranged. In accordance with the
state regulations it was to be a ten round, no decision bout--the weight
of the gloves was prescribed by law.
</p><p>The name of the “white hope” against whom Billy was to go was sufficient
to draw a fair house, and there were some there who had seen Billy in
other fights and looked for a good mill. When the “coming champion,”
 as Billy's opponent was introduced, stepped into the ring he received
a hearty round of applause, whereas there was but a scattered ripple
of handclapping to greet the mucker. It was the first time he ever had
stepped into a ring with a first-rate fighter, and as he saw the huge
muscles of his antagonist and recalled the stories he had heard of
his prowess and science, Billy, for the first time in his life, felt a
tremor of nervousness.
</p><p>His eyes wandered across the ropes to the sea of faces turned up toward
him, and all of a sudden Billy Byrne went into a blue funk. Professor
Cassidy, shrewd and experienced, saw it even as soon as Billy realized
it--he saw the fading of his high hopes--he saw his castles in Spain
tumbling in ruins about his ears--he saw his huge giant lying prone
within that squared circle as the hand of the referee rose and fell in
cadence to the ticking of seconds that would count his man out.
</p><p>“Here,” he whispered, “take a swig o' this,” and he pressed a bottle
toward Billy's lips.
</p><p>Billy shook his head. The stuff had kept him down all his life--he had
sworn never to touch another drop of it, and he never would, whether he
lost this and every other fight he ever fought. He had sworn to leave
it alone for HER sake! And then the gong called him to the center of the
ring.
</p><p>Billy knew that he was afraid--he thought that he was afraid of the big,
trained fighter who faced him; but Cassidy knew that it was a plain case
of stage fright that had gripped his man. He knew, too, that it would
be enough to defeat Billy's every chance for victory, and after the big
“white hope” had felled Billy twice in the first minute of the first
round Cassidy knew that it was all over but the shouting.
</p><p>The fans, many of them, were laughing, and yelling derogatory remarks at
Billy.
</p><p>“Stan' up an' fight, yeh big stiff!” and “Back to de farm fer youse!”
 and then, high above the others a shrill voice cried “Coward! Coward!”
</p><p>The word penetrated Billy's hopeless, muddled brain. Coward! SHE had
called him that once, and then she had changed her mind. Theriere had
thought him a coward, yet as he died he had said that he was the bravest
man he ever had known. Billy recalled the yelling samurai with their
keen swords and terrible spears. He saw the little room in the “palace”
 of Oda Yorimoto, and again he faced the brown devils who had hacked
and hewed and stabbed at him that day as he fought to save the woman he
loved. Coward! What was there in this padded ring for a man to fear
who had faced death as Billy had faced it, and without an instant's
consciousness of the meaning of the word fear? What was wrong with him,
and then the shouts and curses and taunts of the crowd smote upon his
ears, and he knew. It was the crowd! Again the heavy fist of the “coming
champion” brought Billy to the mat, and then, before further damage
could be done him, the gong saved him.
</p><p>It was a surprised and chastened mucker that walked with bent head to
his corner after the first round. The “white hope” was grinning and
confident, and so he returned to the center of the ring for the second
round. During the short interval Billy had thrashed the whole thing out.
The crowd had gotten on his nerves. He was trying to fight the whole
crowd instead of just one man--he would do better in this round; but the
first thing that happened after he faced his opponent sent the fans into
delirious ecstasies of shouting and hooting.
</p><p>Billy swung his right for his foe's jaw--a terrible blow that would have
ended the fight had it landed--but the man side-stepped it, and Billy's
momentum carried him sprawling upon his face. When he regained his feet
the “white hope” was waiting for him, and Billy went down again to lie
there, quite still, while the hand of the referee marked the seconds:
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Billy opened his eyes. Seven. Billy
sat up. Eight. The meaning of that monotonous count finally percolated
to the mucker's numbed perceptive faculties. He was being counted out!
Nine! Like a flash he was on his feet. He had forgotten the crowd.
Rage--cool, calculating rage possessed him--not the feverish, hysterical
variety that takes its victim's brains away.
</p><p>They had been counting out the man whom Barbara Harding had once
loved!--the man she had thought the bravest in the world!--they were
making a monkey and a coward of him! He'd show them!
</p><p>The “white hope” was waiting for him. Billy was scarce off his knees
before the man rushed at him wickedly, a smile playing about his lips.
It was to be the last of that smile, however. Billy met the rush with
his old familiar crouch, and stopped his man with a straight to the
body.
</p><p>Cassidy saw it and almost smiled. He didn't think that Billy could come
back--but at least he was fighting for a minute in his old form.
</p><p>The surprised “hope” rushed in to punish his presuming foe. The crowd
was silent. Billy ducked beneath a vicious left swing and put a right to
the side of the “hope's” head that sent the man to his knees. Then came
the gong.
</p><p>In the third round Billy fought carefully. He had made up his mind that
he would show this bunch of pikers that he knew how to box, so that none
might say that he had won with a lucky punch, for Billy intended to win.
</p><p>The round was one which might fill with delight the soul of the fan who
knows the finer points of the game. And when it was over, while little
damage had been done on either side, it left no shadow of a doubt in the
minds of those who knew that the unknown fighter was the more skilful
boxer.
</p><p>Then came the fourth round. Of course there was no question in the minds
of the majority of the spectators as to who would win the fight. The
stranger had merely shown one of those sudden and ephemeral bursts of
form that occasionally are witnessed in every branch of sport; but he
couldn't last against such a man as the “white hope”!--they looked for a
knock-out any minute now. Nor did they look in vain.
</p><p>Billy was quite satisfied with the work he had done in the preceding
round. Now he would show them another style of fighting! And he did.
From the tap of the gong he rushed his opponent about the ring at will.
He hit him when and where he pleased. The man was absolutely helpless
before him. With left and right hooks Billy rocked the “coming
champion's” head from side to side. He landed upon the swelling optics
of his victim as he listed.
</p><p>Thrice he rushed him to the ropes, and once the man fell through them
into the laps of the hooting spectators--only now they were not hooting
Billy. Until the gong Billy played with his man as a cat might play with
a mouse; yet not once had he landed a knock-out blow.
</p><p>“Why didn't you finish him?” cried Professor Cassidy, as Billy returned
to his corner after the round. “You had 'im goin' man--why in the world
didn't yeh finish him?”
</p><p>“I didn't want to,” said Billy; “not in that round. I'm reserving the
finish for the fifth round, and if you want to win some money you can
take the hunch!”
</p><p>“Do you mean it?” asked Cassidy.
</p><p>“Sure,” said Billy. “You might make more by laying that I'd make him
take the count in the first minute of the round--you can place a hundred
of mine on that, if you will, please.”
</p><p>Cassidy took the hunch, and a moment later as the two men faced each
other he regretted his act, for to his surprise the “white hope” came up
for the fifth round smiling and confident once more.
</p><p>“Someone's been handin' him an earful,” grumbled Cassidy, “an' it might
be all he needed to take 'im through the first minute of the round, and
maybe the whole round--I've seen that did lots o' times.”
</p><p>As the two men met the “white hope” was the aggressor. He rushed in
to close quarters aiming a stinging blow at Billy's face, and then to
Cassidy's chagrin and the crowd's wonder, the mucker lowered his guard
and took the wallop full on the jaw. The blow seemed never to jar him
the least. The “hope” swung again, and there stood Billy Byrne, like
a huge bronze statue taking blow after blow that would have put an
ordinary man down for the count.
</p><p>The fans saw and appreciated the spectacular bravado of the act, and
they went wild. Cheer on cheer rose, hoarse and deafening, to the
rafters. The “white hope” lost his self-control and what little remained
of his short temper, and deliberately struck Billy a foul blow, but
before the referee could interfere the mucker swung another just such
blow as he had missed and fallen with in the second round; but this time
he did not miss--his mighty fist caught the “coming champion” on the
point of the chin, lifted him off his feet and landed him halfway
through the ropes. There he lay while the referee tolled off the count
of ten, and as the official took Billy's hand in his and raised it
aloft in signal that he had won the fight the fickle crowd cheered and
screamed in a delirium of joy.
</p><p>Cassidy crawled through the ropes and threw his arms around Billy.
</p><p>“I knew youse could do it, kid!” he screamed. “You're as good as made
now, an' you're de next champ, or I never seen one.”
</p><p>The following morning the sporting sheets hailed “Sailor” Byrne as the
greatest “white hope” of them all. Flashlights of him filled a quarter
of a page. There were interviews with him. Interviews with the man he
had defeated. Interviews with Cassidy. Interviews with the referee.
Interviews with everybody, and all were agreed that he was the most
likely heavy since Jeffries. Corbett admitted that, while in his prime
he could doubtless have bested the new wonder, he would have found him a
tough customer.
</p><p>Everyone said that Byrne's future was assured. There was not a man in
sight who could touch him, and none who had seen him fight the night
before but would have staked his last dollar on him in a mill with the
black champion.
</p><p>Cassidy wired a challenge to the Negro's manager, and received an answer
that was most favorable. The terms were, as usual, rather one-sided
but Cassidy accepted them, and it seemed before noon that a fight was
assured.
</p><p>Billy was more nearly happy again than he had been since the day he had
renounced Barbara Harding to the man he thought she loved. He read
and re-read the accounts in the papers, and then searching for more
references to himself off the sporting page he ran upon the very name
that had been constantly in his thoughts for all these months--Harding.
</p>
<p>Persistent rumor has it that the engagement of the beautiful Miss
Harding to Wm. J. Mallory has been broken. Miss Harding could not be
seen at her father's home up to a late hour last night. Mr. Mallory
refused to discuss the matter, but would not deny the rumor.
</p>
<p>There was more, but that was all that Billy Byrne read. The paper
dropped from his hand. Battles and championships faded from his
thoughts. He sat with his eyes bent upon the floor, and his mind was
thousands of miles away across the broad Pacific upon a little island in
the midst of a turbulent stream.
</p><p>And far uptown another sat with the same paper in her hand. Barbara
Harding was glancing through the sporting sheet in search of the scores
of yesterday's woman's golf tournament. And as she searched her eyes
suddenly became riveted upon the picture of a giant man, and she forgot
about tournaments and low scores. Hastily she searched the heads and
text until she came upon the name--“'Sailor' Byrne!”
</p><p>Yes! It must be he. Greedily she read and re-read all that had been
written about him. Yes, she, Barbara Harding, scion of an aristocratic
house--ultra-society girl, read and re-read the accounts of a brutal
prize fight.
</p><p>A half hour later a messenger boy found “Sailor” Byrne the center of
an admiring throng in Professor Cassidy's third-floor gymnasium. With
worshiping eyes taking in his new hero from head to foot the youth
handed Byrne a note.
</p><p>He stood staring at the heavy weight until he had perused it.
</p><p>“Any answer?” he asked.
</p><p>“No answer, kid,” replied Byrne, “that I can't take myself,” and he
tossed a dollar to the worshiping boy.
</p><p>An hour later Billy Byrne was ascending the broad, white steps that led
to the entrance of Anthony Harding's New York house. The servant who
answered his ring eyed him suspiciously, for Billy Byrne still dressed
like a teamster on holiday. He had no card!
</p><p>“Tell Miss Harding that Mr. Byrne has come,” he said.
</p><p>The servant left him standing in the hallway, and started to ascend the
great staircase, but halfway up he met Miss Harding coming down.
</p><p>“Never mind, Smith,” she said. “I am expecting Mr. Byrne,” and then
seeing that the fellow had not seated her visitor she added, “He is a
very dear friend.” Smith faded quickly from the scene.
</p><p>“Billy!” cried the girl, rushing toward him with out-stretched hands.
“O Billy, we thought you were dead. How long have you been here? Why
haven't you been to see me?”
</p><p>Byrne hesitated.
</p><p>A great, mad hope had been surging through his being since he had read
of the broken engagement and received the girl's note. And now in her
eyes, in her whole attitude, he could read, as unmistakably as though
her lips had formed the words that he had not hoped in vain.
</p><p>But some strange influence had seemed suddenly to come to work upon
him. Even in the brief moment of his entrance into the magnificence of
Anthony Harding's home he had felt a strange little stricture of the
throat--a choking, half-suffocating sensation.
</p><p>The attitude of the servant, the splendor of the furnishings, the
stateliness of the great hall, and the apartments opening upon it--all
had whispered to him that he did not “belong.”
</p><p>And now Barbara, clothed in some wondrous foreign creation, belied by
her very appearance the expression that suffused her eyes.
</p><p>No, Billy Byrne, the mucker, did not belong there. Nor ever could he
belong, more than Barbara ever could have “belonged” on Grand Avenue.
And Billy Byrne knew it now. His heart went cold. The bottom seemed
suddenly to have dropped out of his life.
</p><p>Bravely he had battled to forget this wonderful creature, or, rather,
his hopeless love for her--her he could never forget. But the note from
her, and the sight of her had but served to rekindle the old fire within
his breast.
</p><p>He thought quickly. His own life or happiness did not count. Nothing
counted now but Barbara. He had seen the lovelight in her eyes. He
thanked God that he had realized what it all would have meant, before he
let her see that he had seen it.
</p><p>“I've been back several months,” he said presently, in answer to her
question; “but I got sense enough to stay where I belong. Gee! Wouldn't
I look great comin' up here buttin' in, wit youse bunch of highlifes?”
</p>
<p>Billy slapped his thigh resoundingly and laughed in stentorian tones
that caused the eyebrows of the sensitive Smith on the floor above to
elevate in shocked horror.
</p><p>“Den dere was de mills. I couldn't break away from me work, could I, to
chase a bunch of skirts?”
</p><p>Barbara felt a qualm of keen disappointment that Billy had fallen again
into the old dialect that she had all but eradicated during those days
upon distant “Manhattan Island.”
</p><p>“I wouldn't o' come up atal,” he went on, “if I hadn't o' read in de
poiper how youse an' Mallory had busted. I t'ought I'd breeze in an' see
wot de trouble was.”
</p><p>His eyes had been averted, mostly, as he talked. Now he swung suddenly
upon her.
</p><p>“He's on de square, ain't he?” he demanded.
</p><p>“Yes,” said Barbara. She was not quite sure whether to feel offended, or
not. But the memory of Billy's antecedents came to his rescue. Of course
he didn't know that it was such terribly bad form to broach such a
subject to her, she thought.
</p><p>“Well, then,” continued the mucker, “wot's up? Mallory's de guy fer
youse. Youse loved him or youse wouldn't have got engaged to him.”
</p><p>The statement was almost an interrogation.
</p><p>Barbara nodded affirmatively.
</p><p>“You see, Billy,” she started, “I have always known Mr. Mallory, and
always thought that I loved him until--until--” There was no answering
light in Billy's eyes--no encouragement for the words that were on
her lips. She halted lamely. “Then,” she went on presently, “we became
engaged after we reached New York. We all thought you dead,” she
concluded simply.
</p><p>“Do you think as much of him now as you did when you promised to marry
him?” he asked, ignoring her reference to himself and all that it
implied.
</p><p>Barbara nodded.
</p><p>“What is at the bottom of this row?” persisted Billy. He had fallen back
into the decent pronunciation that Barbara had taught him, but neither
noticed the change. For a moment he had forgotten that he was playing a
part. Then he recollected.
</p><p>“Nothing much,” replied the girl. “I couldn't rid myself of the feeling
that they had murdered you, by leaving you back there alone and wounded.
I began to think 'coward' every time I saw Mr. Mallory. I couldn't marry
him, feeling that way toward him, and, Billy, I really never LOVED him
as--as--” Again she stumbled, but the mucker made no attempt to grasp
the opportunity opened before him.
</p><p>Instead he crossed the library to the telephone. Running through the
book he came presently upon the number he sought. A moment later he had
his connection.
</p><p>“Is this Mallory?” he asked.
</p><p>“I'm Byrne--Billy Byrne. De guy dat cracked your puss fer youse on de
Lotus.”
</p><p>“Dead, hell! Not me. Say, I'm up here at Barbara's.”
</p><p>“Yes, dat's wot I said. She wants youse to beat it up here's swift as
youse kin beat it.”
</p><p>Barbara Harding stepped forward. Her eyes were blazing.
</p><p>“How dare you?” she cried, attempting to seize the telephone from
Billy's grasp.
</p><p>He turned his huge frame between her and the instrument. “Git a move!”
 he shouted into the mouthpiece. “Good-bye!” and he hung up.
</p><p>Then he turned back toward the angry girl.
</p><p>“Look here,” he said. “Once youse was strong on de sob stuff wit me,
tellin' me how noble I was, an' all de different tings youse would do
fer me to repay all I done fer youse. Now youse got de chanct.”
</p><p>“What do you mean?” asked the girl, puzzled. “What can I do for you?”
</p><p>“Youse kin do dis fer me. When Mallory gits here youse kin tell him dat
de engagement is all on again--see!”
</p><p>In the wide eyes of the girl Billy read a deeper hurt than he had
dreamed of. He had thought that it would not be difficult for her to
turn back from the vulgar mucker to the polished gentleman. And when he
saw that she was suffering, and guessed that it was because he had tried
to crush her love by brute force he could carry the game no further.
</p><p>“O Barbara,” he cried, “can't you see that Mallory is your kind--that HE
is a fit mate for you. I have learned since I came into this house a few
minutes ago the unbridgeable chasm that stretches between Billy Byrne,
the mucker, and such as you. Once I aspired; but now I know just as you
must have always known, that a single lifetime is far too short for a
man to cover the distance from Grand Avenue to Riverside Drive.
</p><p>“I want you to be happy, Barbara, just as I intend to be. Back there in
Chicago there are plenty of girls on Grand Avenue as straight and clean
and fine as they make 'em on Riverside Drive. Girls of my own kind, they
are, and I'm going back there to find the one that God intended for me.
You've taught me what a good girl can do toward making a man of a beast.
You've taught me pride and self-respect. You've taught me so much that
I'd rather that I'd died back there beneath the spears of Oda Iseka's
warriors than live here beneath the sneers and contempt of servants, and
the pity and condescension of your friends.
</p><p>“I want you to be happy, Barbara, and so I want you to promise me that
you'll marry Billy Mallory. There isn't any man on earth quite good
enough for you; but Mallory comes nearer to it than anyone I know. I've
heard 'em talking about him around town since I came back--and there
isn't a rotten story chalked up against him nowhere, and that's a lot
more than you can say for ninety-nine of a hundred New Yorkers that are
talked about at all.
</p><p>“And Mallory's a man, too--the kind that every woman ought to have, only
they ain't enough of 'em to go 'round. Do you remember how he stood up
there on the deck of the Lotus and fought fair against my dirty tricks?
He's a man and a gentleman, Barbara--the sort you can be proud of, and
that's the sort you got to have. You see I know you.
</p><p>“And he fought against those fellows of Yoka in the street of Oda
Iseka's village like a man should fight. There ain't any yellow in him,
Barbara, and he didn't leave me until there seemed no other way, even
in the face of the things I told them to make them go. Don't harbor that
against him--I only wonder that he didn't croak me; your dad wanted to,
and Mallory wouldn't let him.”
</p><p>“They never told me that,” said Barbara.
</p><p>The bell rang.
</p><p>“Here he is now,” said Billy. “Good-bye--I'd rather not see him.
Smith'll let me out the servants' door. Guess that'll make him feel
better. You'll do as I ask, Barbara?”
</p><p>He had paused at the door, turning toward her as he asked the final
question.
</p><p>The girl stood facing him. Her eyes were dim with unshed tears. Billy
Byrne swam before them in a hazy mist.
</p><p>“You'll do as I ask, Barbara!” he repeated, but this time it was a
command.
</p><p>As Mallory entered the room Barbara heard the door of the servants'
entrance slam behind Billy Byrne.
