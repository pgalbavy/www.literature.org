<p>Meanwhile a singular experience befell Dr. Spellman and his wife.
After their departure from the bungalow, they glided smoothly
in the canoe toward the eastern end of Gosling Lake, keeping a
little way off shore where though the water was crystalline the
depth was too great to allow them to see the pebbly bottom. The
woman sat forward, gazing with tranquil enjoyment upon the soothing
picture before them. The husband, facing in the same direction,
was in the stern of the craft, so that the balance was nicely
adjusted. Swinging the paddle well forward, he took the water
with a long easy stroke, finishing with an inward turn of the
wrist that kept the canoe on a straight course.</p>

<p>They had set out to call upon Uncle Elk the hermit. While etiquette,
as has been said, demanded that it should be the other way, especially
since the physician had already left his card at the log cabin,
the matter was too trifling to be regarded. The stories which
the couple had heard of the strange old man stirred their curiosity,
and it was in accord with the sympathetic nature of the woman
that she believed she might do a little to cheer the exile in
his loneliness.</p>

<p>The short voyage soon ended. Dr. Spellman guided his boat to
the edge of the wood where Uncle Elk made a practice of landing,
and from which a well marked path wound its way among the trees
to the dwelling that was invisible from the lake. The canoe of
the Instructor in Woodcraft was drawn up the bank and turned over
bottom up.</p>

<p>"That looks as if we shall find him at home," remarked the wife,
as she stepped lightly ashore and was followed by her husband,
who pulled the craft far enough to hold it secure during their
absence.</p>

<p>"It may be he is off on a tramp with no telling when he will
return. He seems to be as fond of the Boy Scouts as they are of
him, and it is likely he has gone to the clubhouse to spend the
day with them."</p>

<p>The man took the lead and walked up the path used on his previous
call, with his wife a few paces behind him. On the edge of the
clearing, they stood for a minute or two contemplating the pleasing
picture. No signs of life were visible, but from where they stood
they could see the leathern string dangling outside the door,
as if inviting every one who chose to enter.</p>

<p>Dr. Spellman gently twitched the string and the door swung inward.
As he stepped across the threshold, his wife followed and the
two looked around them. The room was precisely as when the physician
called before and has already been described, but the owner of
the premises was not in sight. No fire smouldered on the hearth
and the stillness of the tomb brooded over everything. It was
natural that so excellent a housekeeper as Mrs. Spellman should
exclaim:</p>

<p>"All is as neat as a pin; Uncle Elk needs no one to teach him
how to keep a model home."</p>

<p>They walked forward and stood in front of the shelves with their
remarkable array of books. The woman, who was known for her excellent
literary taste, commented upon the high character of the volumes,
but neither laid hands on them. She seated herself in the rocking
chair while her husband stood near.</p>

<p>"The question is whether we shall wait here until he comes back,"
said the latter.</p>

<p>"How can we know when he will return?"</p>

<p>"We don’t; it may be within an hour or not until night. It isn’t
worth while to stay; I can leave my card as before."</p>

<p>He drew the pasteboard from his pocket and wrote a few pleasant
words, reminding Uncle Elk of his obligations to his callers,
and urging him to visit the house at the other side of the lake
as soon as possible and spend the day and evening with them.</p>

<p>While the husband sat at the table in the middle of the room,
writing his hurried message, his wife faced the curtain which
shut off the other half of the cabin and behind which neither
of the callers thought of intruding or peeping. Suddenly a queer
thrill passed through her, for she was sure she saw the curtains
move,—so slightly indeed that had she not been looking directly
at it she would not have detected the stir. She said nothing and
of course her husband had no suspicion.</p>

<p>The wife gazed intently at the spot where she had noticed the
slight agitation and listened keenly, but heard nothing nor did
she detect any disturbance. She quietly rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"We may as well go; the day is too lovely to stay within doors."</p>

<p>"Which probably explains why Uncle Elk is not at home. Do you
know, my dear, I half envy him his life. He is out of the hurly-burly
of politics, strife, and the endless vexations that we who live
in cities cannot escape."</p>

<p>"And yet you would not be willing to pay the price that he does."</p>

<p>"No," was the thoughtful reply of the husband, as he led the
way across the threshold, carefully closed the door, and passed
down the path to their canoe. "There is such a thing as paying
too much for what we get."</p>

<p>When the craft had been paddled some distance, the wife turned
her head.</p>

<p>"Wilson, do you know where Uncle Elk is?"</p>

<p>"I haven’t the remotest idea."</p>

<p>"I can tell you: he is in his cabin and was there all the time
we were inside."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the husband, so astonished that he
ceased paddling and stared at her.</p>

<p>"While you sat at the table writing your note to him, he moved
the curtain; I saw it."</p>

<p>She related what she had witnessed when not dreaming of anything
of the kind.</p>

<p>"The agitation may have been caused by a draft of air."</p>

<p>"I thought that, but the windows were closed in the room where
we sat."</p>

<p>"There are windows in the other room."</p>

<p>"But, if either was open, there was nothing to make a draft.
There is no mistake about it;—Uncle Elk was within a few feet
of us all the time."</p>

<p>The wife was so positive that her husband was brought to her
way of thinking.</p>

<p>"Strange as it seems, you are right. There can be no doubt now
that he doesn’t wish to meet us. He must have known of our camp
on the other side of the lake and ought to have paid his respects
to us. More than that, he ignored my invitation, though the time
is so brief since it was made that that of itself is not conclusive.
Well, all we can do is to accept the facts and leave him to himself."</p>

<p>"He has been represented as the soul of hospitality. Why should
he be repelled by us? Why did he not pull in his latchstring?"</p>

<p>"He was not expecting us or he might have done so."</p>

<p>The doctor resumed his deliberate paddling and a minute later
his wife asked:</p>

<p>"Have you any suspicion of the reason for his acting as he did?"</p>

<p>"It is a mystery to me. He and I have never met, and I cannot
fancy any cause for his antipathy. Whatever the reason, it surely
is unjustifiable and I am sorry we did not have the chance to
demand an explanation. I think I shall tell what has happened
to Scout Master Hall, and get him to make some guarded inquiries.
I cannot rest content until this misunderstanding is cleared up."</p>

<p>The couple returned to their home after fishing awhile, and did
not leave again during the day. Neither would confess the fact
to the other, but they missed their child so keenly that they
would have paddled to the other side of the lake and brought her
home, had they not felt ashamed of such weakness. The doctor read,
slept, smoked and yawned and was sure he had never started in
on so long an afternoon.</p>

<p>It was not to pass, however, without incident. He stretched in
his hammock, one leg hanging out so that the tip of his tan shoe
touched the ground and gave him enough leverage to sway gently
back and forth, while he smoked his perfecto and longed for the
morning when "Stubby" would be with them again. The wife was seated
in the small dwelling, busy with crochet work, and thinking pretty
much as did her husband, when both were startled by the greeting
in a gruff voice that evidently was meant to be conciliatory:</p>

<p>"Good arternoon, lady and gentleman."</p>

<p>With a faint gasp, the wife looked up, while the doctor swung
both feet so as to rest them on the ground, sat upright, checked
the swaying of the hammock and picked up his hat which had fallen
to the ground.</p>

<p>"Hello! where did <em>you</em> come from?"</p>

<p>Two frowsy, villainous looking tramps had come out of the woods,
walking so softly in their dilapidated gum shoes that they were
not heard until they spoke. These gentry as a rule do not abound
in Maine, but no section of our country is absolutely free of
them. The two were burly vagrants with matted hair, spiky beards,
and hickory shirts, much in need of washing and without collars.
One supported his patched trousers by means of a single soiled
suspender which, crossing the shoulder, was skewered in front
by a wooden peg. His companion obtained the same result by means
of a leathern belt buckled around his waist. They were innocent
of stockings and wore straw hats, one of which lacked a crown,
and the other was minus one half of its original brim. Both doffed
their head gear and assumed the cringing attitude of all members
of the begging fraternity.</p>

<p>Dr. Spellman was anything but pleased with his callers. He had
hoped he was rid of the tribe, but here were a couple of them
and he faced the situation.</p>

<p>"We ambled all the way, sir, from Bath since morning," was the
reply of the one who stood nearest the doctor.</p>

<p>"No you didn’t; the distance is too far and none of your kind
could be persuaded to step aside into a place with such a name
as Bath."</p>

<p>One of the scraggly rogues turned to his companion.</p>

<p>"Say, Saxy, was the last town, where we spent a week at the leading
hotel, Bath or Christmas Cove?"</p>

<p>"Naw; it was Boothby Harbor,—what guff are ye giving us?"</p>

<p>"It is a small matter," said the doctor; "what is your purpose
in calling here?"</p>

<p>"Jes’ to show our respects, boss; we haven’t our cards wid us,
but me name is Buzy Biggs and my valet here is Saxy Hutt, late
from Washington, where he’s been serving as aide to the President."</p>

<p>"Whither are you bound?"</p>

<p>"We haven’t made up our minds whether to accept a invite to lecture
afore the Boston Lyceum or to go on to New York and give the folks
a talk on the Whichness of the Which. But that ain’t nyther here
nur there. We have been walking since daylight and hain’t had
a mouthful of grub since yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"We cannot let any one go away from our door hungry," broke in
Mrs. Spellman, laying aside her fancy work and flitting into the
kitchen department.</p>

<p>"I don’t see how you’re going to help it," called her husband,
"when you undertake to give a couple of tramps all they can eat.
They are like dogs—always hungry."</p>

<p>"Ain’t ye a little rough, boss, on a gentleman?" asked Biggs,
with an ominous glint in his piglike eyes.</p>

<p>"Produce the gentleman and I’ll reply."</p>

<p>The physician’s dislike of the nuisances was so strong that he
could not pretend to hide it. Sharp words might have been followed
by something regrettable, had not the wife come out at this moment
bearing a couple of enormous ham sandwiches. The men again doffed
their fragmentary hats, bowed and mumbled their thanks.</p>

<p>"<em>There’s</em> the gentleman," said Biggs, nodding toward
the smiling woman and addressing her husband, "which you was saying
you would like to see. These be fine sandwiches and will sarve
us very well for starters."</p>

<p>"That’s what they are meant to do," said the doctor; "you may
start at once and need not show yourselves here again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don’t know," said Biggs, speaking with his mouth stuffed
full of meat and bread; "I reckon you don’t own the lake and this
part of the State."</p>

<p>"I own enough to warn you to keep your distance; we choose our
friends."</p>

<p>"Mebbe we may take a notion to drop in on ye bime by; with thanks,
mum, we now sagaciate."</p>

<p>Dr. Spellman was a man of quick temper, and felt so incensed
by the smirking glance of the scamp at his wife, that he bounded
from his hammock and into the house for his revolver. Suspecting
his purpose, his wife interposed:</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Wilson?"</p>

<p>"Shoot that scoundrel! Let me get my pistol."</p>

<p>"You shall do nothing of the kind; the man hasn’t done me any
harm and is leaving. He doesn’t deserve another thought."</p>

<p>"He deserves what he will get if he ever dares to show himself
here again."</p>

<p>The doctor had the good habit of yielding to the domination of
his much better tempered partner. He turned round without his
weapon and resumed his seat in the hammock which he nervously
rocked, thereby helping to soothe his anger. His wife sat on a
camp stool and did not speak but looked at him with a smile whose
significance was that of many words.</p>

<p>"Don’t," he protested; "pitch in and scold all you wish, but
don’t look at me like that—hello! hark!"</p>

<p>From across the lake came the faint, dull report of a revolver.
The doctor raised his hand and whispered:</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>In a few seconds, a second report traveled over the water to
their ears. If that was all, it would mean nothing, but with the
same interval, the third sound reached the startled couple.</p>

<p>"It is a call for help!" exclaimed the doctor bounding to his
feet; "I am wanted at once by the Boy Scouts."</p>

<p>The wife turned white and gasped: "Something has happened to
Ruth!"</p>

<p>"We can’t know until we reach camp; come on!"</p>

<p>He dashed into the house, caught up his case of instruments and
revolver, but left his rifle. Quick as he was, she was at the
shore ahead of him and had grasped the canoe to shove it into
the water. At the moment the craft was floating clear and the
doctor caught up the paddle, they heard again the triple reports
of the revolver,—one after the other and with but an interval
of a second or two between the shots.</p>

<p>And then Dr. Spellman paddled as he had never paddled before,
for no more powerful motive could have stirred all the strength
and energy of his nature. </p>
