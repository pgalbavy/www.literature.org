<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A European lately arrived in China, if he is of a receptive and
reflective disposition, finds himself confronted with a number
of very puzzling questions, for many of which the problems of
Western Europe will not have prepared him. Russian problems, it
is true, have important affinities with those of China, but they
have also important differences; moreover they are decidedly less
complex. Chinese problems, even if they affected no one outside
China, would be of vast importance, since the Chinese are estimated
to constitute about a quarter of the human race. In fact, however,
all the world will be vitally affected by the development of Chinese
affairs, which may well prove a decisive factor, for good or evil,
during the next two centuries. This makes it important, to Europe
and America almost as much as to Asia, that there should be an
intelligent understanding of the questions raised by China, even
if, as yet, definite answers are difficult to give.</p>

<p>The questions raised by the present condition of China fall naturally
into three groups, economic, political, and cultural. No one of
these groups, however, can be considered in isolation, because
each is intimately bound up with the other two. For my part, I
think the cultural questions are the most important, both for
China and for mankind; if these could be solved, I would accept,
with more or less equanimity, any political or economic system
which ministered to that end. Unfortunately, however, cultural
questions have little interest for practical men, who regard money
and power as the proper ends for nations as for individuals. The
helplessness of the artist in a hard-headed business community
has long been a commonplace of novelists and moralizers, and has
made collectors feel virtuous when they bought up the pictures
of painters who had died in penury. China may be regarded as an
artist nation, with the virtues and vices to be expected of the
artist: virtues chiefly useful to others, and vices chiefly harmful
to oneself. Can Chinese virtues be preserved? Or must China, in
order to survive, acquire, instead, the vices which make for success
and cause misery to others only? And if China does copy the model
set by all foreign nations with which she has dealings, what will
become of all of us?</p>

<p>China has an ancient civilization which is now undergoing a very
rapid process of change. The traditional civilization of China
had developed in almost complete independence of Europe, and had
merits and demerits quite different from those of the West. It
would be futile to attempt to strike a balance; whether our present
culture is better or worse, on the whole, than that which seventeenth-century
missionaries found in the Celestial Empire is a question as to
which no prudent person would venture to pronounce. But it is
easy to point to certain respects in which we are better than
old China, and to other respects in which we are worse. If intercourse
between Western nations and China is to be fruitful, we must cease
to regard ourselves as missionaries of a superior civilization,
or, worse still, as men who have a right to exploit, oppress,
and swindle the Chinese because they are an "inferior" race. I
do not see any reason to believe that the Chinese are inferior
to ourselves; and I think most Europeans, who have any intimate
knowledge of China, would take the same view.</p>

<p>In comparing an alien culture with one's own, one is forced to
ask oneself questions more fundamental than any that usually arise
in regard to home affairs. One is forced to ask: What are the
things that I ultimately value? What would make me judge one sort
of society more desirable than another sort? What sort of ends
should I most wish to see realized in the world? Different people
will answer these questions differently, and I do not know of
any argument by which I could persuade a man who gave an answer
different from my own. I must therefore be content merely to state
the answer which appeals to me, in the hope that the reader may
feel likewise.</p>

<p>The main things which seem to me important on their own account,
and not merely as means to other things, are: knowledge, art,
instinctive happiness, and relations of friendship or affection.
When I speak of knowledge, I do not mean all knowledge; there
is much in the way of dry lists of facts that is merely useful,
and still more that has no appreciable value of any kind. But
the understanding of Nature, incomplete as it is, which is to
be derived from science, I hold to be a thing which is good and
delightful on its own account. The same may be said, I think,
of some biographies and parts of history. To enlarge on this topic
would, however, take me too far from my theme. When I speak of
art as one of the things that have value on their own account,
I do not mean only the deliberate productions of trained artists,
though of course these, at their best, deserve the highest place.
I mean also the almost unconscious effort after beauty which one
finds among Russian peasants and Chinese coolies, the sort of
impulse that creates folk-songs, that existed among ourselves
before the time of the Puritans, and survives in cottage gardens.
Instinctive happiness, or joy of life, is one of the most important
widespread popular goods that we have lost through industrialism
and the high pressure at which most of us live; its commonness
in China is a strong reason for thinking well of Chinese civilization.</p>

<p>In judging of a community, we have to consider, not only how
much of good or evil there is within the community, but also what
effects it has in promoting good or evil in other communities,
and how far the good things which it enjoys depend upon evils
elsewhere. In this respect, also, China is better than we are.
Our prosperity, and most of what we endeavour to secure for ourselves,
can only be obtained by widespread oppression and exploitation
of weaker nations, while the Chinese are not strong enough to
injure other countries, and secure whatever they enjoy by means
of their own merits and exertions alone.</p>

<p>These general ethical considerations are by no means irrelevant
in considering the practical problems of China. Our industrial
and commercial civilization has been both the effect and the cause
of certain more or less unconscious beliefs as to what is worth
while; in China one becomes conscious of these beliefs through
the spectacle of a society which challenges them by being built,
just as unconsciously, upon a different standard of values. Progress
and efficiency, for example, make no appeal to the Chinese, except
to those who have come under Western influence. By valuing progress
and efficiency, we have secured power and wealth; by ignoring
them, the Chinese, until we brought disturbance, secured on the
whole a peaceable existence and a life full of enjoyment. It is
difficult to compare these opposite achievements unless we have
some standard of values in our minds; and unless it is a more
or less conscious standard, we shall undervalue the less familiar
civilization, because evils to which we are not accustomed always
make a stronger impression than those that we have learned to
take as a matter of course.</p>

<p>The culture of China is changing rapidly, and undoubtedly rapid
change is needed. The change that has hitherto taken place is
traceable ultimately to the military superiority of the West;
but in future our economic superiority is likely to be quite as
potent. I believe that, if the Chinese are left free to assimilate
what they want of our civilization, and to reject what strikes
them as bad, they will be able to achieve an organic growth from
their own tradition, and to produce a very splendid result, combining
our merits with theirs. There are, however, two opposite dangers
to be avoided if this is to happen. The first danger is that they
may become completely Westernized, retaining nothing of what has
hitherto distinguished them, adding merely one more to the restless,
intelligent, industrial, and militaristic nations which now afflict
this unfortunate planet. The second danger is that they may be
driven, in the course of resistance to foreign aggression, into
an intense anti-foreign conservatism as regards everything except
armaments. This has happened in Japan, and it may easily happen
in China. The future of Chinese culture is intimately bound up
with political and economic questions; and it is through their
influence that dangers arise.</p>

<p>China is confronted with two very different groups of foreign
Powers, on the one hand the white nations, on the other hand Japan.
In considering the effect of the white races on the Far East as
a whole, modern Japan must count as a Western product; therefore
the responsibility for Japan's doings in China rests ultimately
with her white teachers. Nevertheless, Japan remains very unlike
Europe and America, and has ambitions different from theirs as
regards China. We must therefore distinguish three possibilities:
(1) China may become enslaved to one or more white nations; (2)
China may become enslaved to Japan; (3) China may recover and
retain her liberty. Temporarily there is a fourth possibility,
namely that a consortium of Japan and the White Powers may control
China; but I do not believe that, in the long run, the Japanese
will be able to co-operate with England and America. In the long
run, I believe that Japan must dominate the Far East or go under.
If the Japanese had a different character this would not be the
case; but the nature of their ambitions makes them exclusive and
unneighbourly. I shall give the reasons for this view when I come
to deal with the relations of China and Japan.</p>

<p>To understand the problem of China, we must first know something
of Chinese history and culture before the irruption of the white
man, then something of modern Chinese culture and its inherent
tendencies; next, it is necessary to deal in outline with the
military and diplomatic relations of the Western Powers with China,
beginning with our war of 1840 and ending with the treaty concluded
after the Boxer rising of 1900. Although the Sino-Japanese war
comes in this period, it is possible to separate, more or less,
the actions of Japan in that war, and to see what system the White
Powers would have established if Japan had not existed. Since
that time, however, Japan has been the dominant foreign influence
in Chinese affairs. It is therefore necessary to understand how
the Japanese became what they are: what sort of nation they were
before the West destroyed their isolation, and what influence
the West has had upon them. Lack of understanding of Japan has
made people in England blind to Japan's aims in China, and unable
to apprehend the meaning of what Japan has done.</p>

<p>Political considerations alone, however, will not suffice to
explain what is going on in relation to China; economic questions
are almost more important. China is as yet hardly industrialized,
and is certainly the most important undeveloped area left in the
world. Whether the resources of China are to be developed by China,
by Japan, or by the white races, is a question of enormous importance,
affecting not only the whole development of Chinese civilization,
but the balance of power in the world, the prospects of peace,
the destiny of Russia, and the chances of development towards
a better economic system in the advanced nations.</p>

<p>The Washington Conference has partly exhibited and partly concealed
the conflict for the possession of China between nations all of
which have guaranteed China's independence and integrity. Its
outcome has made it far more difficult than before to give a hopeful
answer as regards Far Eastern problems, and in particular as regards
the question: Can China preserve any shadow of independence without
a great development of nationalism and militarism? I cannot bring
myself to advocate nationalism and militarism, yet it is difficult
to know what to say to patriotic Chinese who ask how they can
be avoided. So far, I have found only one answer. The Chinese
nation, is the most, patient in the world; it thinks of centuries
as other nations think of decades. It is essentially indestructible,
and can afford to wait. The "civilized" nations of the world,
with their blockades, their poison gases, their bombs, submarines,
and negro armies, will probably destroy each other within the
next hundred years, leaving the stage to those whose pacifism
has kept them alive, though poor and powerless. If China can avoid
being goaded into war, her oppressors may wear themselves out
in the end, and leave the Chinese free to pursue humane ends,
instead of the war and rapine and destruction which all white
nations love. It is perhaps a slender hope for China, and for
ourselves it is little better than despair. But unless the Great
Powers learn some moderation and some tolerance, I do not see
any better possibility, though I see many that are worse.</p>

<p>Our Western civilization is built upon assumptions, which, to
a psychologist, are rationalizings of excessive energy. Our industrialism,
our militarism, our love of progress, our missionary zeal, our
imperialism, our passion for dominating and organizing, all spring
from a superflux of the itch for activity. The creed of efficiency
for its own sake, without regard for the ends to which it is directed,
has become somewhat discredited in Europe since the war, which
would have never taken place if the Western nations had been slightly
more indolent. But in America this creed is still almost universally
accepted; so it is in Japan, and so it is by the Bolsheviks, who
have been aiming fundamentally at the Americanization of Russia.
Russia, like China, may be described as an artist nation; but
unlike China it has been governed, since the time of Peter the
Great, by men who wished to introduce all the good and evil of
the West. In former days, I might have had no doubt that such
men were in the right. Some (though not many) of the Chinese returned
students resemble them in the belief that Western push and hustle
are the most desirable things on earth. I cannot now take this
view. The evils produced in China by indolence seem to me far
less disastrous, from the point of view of mankind at large, than
those produced throughout the world by the domineering cocksureness
of Europe and America. The Great War showed that something is
wrong with our civilization; experience of Russia and China has
made me believe that those countries can help to show us what
it is that is wrong. The Chinese have discovered, and have practised
for many centuries, a way of life which, if it could be adopted
by all the world, would make all the world happy. We Europeans
have not. Our way of life demands strife, exploitation, restless
change, discontent and destruction. Efficiency directed to destruction
can only end in annihilation, and it is to this consummation that
our civilization is tending, if it cannot learn some of that wisdom
for which it despises the East.</p>

<p>It was on the Volga, in the summer of 1920, that I first realized
how profound is the disease in our Western mentality, which the
Bolsheviks are attempting to force upon an essentially Asiatic
population, just as Japan and the West are doing in China. Our
boat travelled on, day after day, through an unknown and mysterious
land. Our company were noisy, gay, quarrelsome, full of facile
theories, with glib explanations of everything, persuaded that
there is nothing they could not understand and no human destiny
outside the purview of their system. One of us lay at death's
door, fighting a grim battle with weakness and terror and the
indifference of the strong, assailed day and night by the sounds
of loud-voiced love-making and trivial laughter. And all around
us lay a great silence, strong as death, unfathomable as the heavens.
It seemed that none had leisure to hear the silence, yet it called
to me so insistently that I grew deaf to the harangues of propagandists
and the endless information of the well-informed.</p>

<p>One night, very late, our boat stopped in a desolate spot where
there were no houses, but only a great sandbank, and beyond it
a row of poplars with the rising moon behind them. In silence
I went ashore, and found on the sand a strange assemblage of human
beings, half-nomads, wandering from some remote region of famine,
each family huddled together surrounded by all its belongings,
some sleeping, others silently making small fires of twigs. The
flickering flames lighted up gnarled, bearded faces of wild men,
strong, patient, primitive women, and children as sedate and slow
as their parents. Human beings they undoubtedly were, and yet
it would have been far easier for me to grow intimate with a dog
or a cat or a horse than with one of them. I knew that they would
wait there day after day, perhaps for weeks, until a boat came
in which they could go to some distant place in which they had
heard&mdash;falsely perhaps&mdash;that the earth was more generous than
in the country they had left. Some would die by the way, all would
suffer hunger and thirst and the scorching mid-day sun, but their
sufferings would be dumb. To me they seemed to typify the very
soul of Russia, unexpressive, inactive from despair, unheeded
by the little set of Westernizers who make up all the parties
of progress or reaction. Russia is so vast that the articulate
few are lost in it as man and his planet are lost in interstellar
space. It is possible, I thought, that the theorists may increase
the misery of the many by trying to force them into actions contrary
to their primeval instincts, but I could not believe that happiness
was to be brought to them by a gospel of industrialism and forced
labour.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when morning came I resumed the interminable discussions
of the materialistic conception of history and the merits of a
truly popular government. Those with whom I discussed had not
seen the sleeping wanderers, and would not have been interested
if they had seen them, since they were not material for propaganda.
But something of that patient silence had communicated itself
to me, something lonely and unspoken remained in my heart throughout
all the comfortable familiar intellectual talk. And at last I
began to feel that all politics are inspired by a grinning devil,
teaching the energetic and quickwitted to torture submissive populations
for the profit of pocket or power or theory. As we journeyed on,
fed by food extracted from the peasants, protected by an army
recruited from among their sons, I wondered what we had to give
them in return. But I found no answer. From time to time I heard
their sad songs or the haunting music of the balalaika; but the
sound mingled with the great silence of the steppes, and left
me with a terrible questioning pain in which Occidental hopefulness
grew pale.</p>

<p>It was in this mood that I set out for China to seek a new hope.</p>
