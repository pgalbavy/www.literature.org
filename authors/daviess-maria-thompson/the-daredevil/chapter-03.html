<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A number of moments in the rapid passing of the next few months I have
wondered what would have resulted if I had taken that vacant chair
between very agreeable Mr. William Raines and very proper Mr. Peter
Scudder so evidently reserved for the young, beautiful and charming
Marquise of Grez and Bye. I have decided that in about the half of one
hour young Mr. Robert Carruthers would have been extinct and the
desired and beloved Marquise in her place between them sipping her tea
while making false excuses for forgiveness. I did not take that seat
but I accepted one which a <u>garçon</u> offered me next to them and
did regard them with both fear and wistfulness, also with an intense
attention so that I might acquire as much as possible from them of an
American gentleman's manner.
</p><p>"I suppose the dame's fussing up for us to the limit, Peter," observed
that Mr. Saint Louis while he emptied a glass of amber liquid and
removed a cherry from its depths with his fingers and devoured it with
the greatest relish. "Gee, but the genuine American cocktail is one
great drink! Have another, Peter. You're so solemn that I am beginning
to believe that <u>belle Marquise</u> did put a dent in your old
Quaker heart after all."
</p><p>"There was something in that girl's eyes as they followed us, William,
that no cocktail ever shaken could get out of my mind," made answer
the very grave Mr. Peter Scudder of Philadelphia. "Do you suppose her
Uncle got there or that anything happened? I wish I had waited with
her."
</p><p>"Well, either Uncle did arrive or we'll see her in the Passing Follies
week after next, third from the left, in as little as Comstock allows.
When I've had a good look at bare arms my judgment connects mighty
easily with bare--"
</p><p>By that moment I had poised in my hand a very fragile cup of nicely
steaming tea and it was a very natural thing that I should hurl its
contents in the face of that Mr. William Raines of the country of
Saint Louis.
</p><p><u>Voila</u>! What happened? Did I stay to fight the duel with that,
what I know now to call a cad, and thus be put back into the person of
the Marquise de Grez and Bye for a wicked Uncle to murder. I did not.
I placed upon the table two large pieces of money and I lost myself in
the crowd of persons who had risen and gathered to sympathize with
poor Mr. Saint Louis. No one had remarked my escape, I felt sure, as I
had been very agile, but as I sauntered out into the entresol of the
Hotel of Ritz-Carlton, to which I had given so great a shock in its
stately tea room, a finger was laid upon my arm in its gray tweed
coat. I turned and discovered a very fine and handsome woman standing
beside me and in her hand she had a book of white paper with also a
pencil.
</p><p>"I was sitting just back of Willie Raines and I heard what he was
saying about some woman, whom he and Peter Scudder had met on the boat
over, not keeping her appointment with them. Peter is of the
Philadelphia elect and nobody knows why he consorts with the gay
Willie. I saw them come off the boat together this morning and I knew
that the whole Scudder Meeting House would be in a glum over their
being together. Would you mind telling me just why you soused your tea
into his face? It would make a corking story for my morning edition.
Did you know them or did you know the lady or did you do it to be
launcelotting?"
</p><p>"I think it must have been for the third of those reasons, Madam, but
I am not sure that I know the word you use," I answered with much
caution.
</p><p>"Launcelot, you know, the boy that was always fussing around over
injured women, in Tennyson or somewhere, just for a love of 'em that
was always perfectly proper. Nice of him but not progressive. Say, do
you mind sitting down in a quiet corner of the tea room and telling me
all about it? Are you French or Russian or Brazilian, and do you
believe in women, or is it just because you like 'em that you threw
the tea? I've got a suffrage article to do and I believe you'd make a
good headline, with your militant tea throwing. Want to tell me all
about it?"
</p><p>"I have just one hour before going to the State of Harpeth, many miles
from here, Madam," I made answer with a great politeness. "I thank you
but I must make my regrets."
</p><p>"Oh, I can find out all I want to know about you in five minutes. Just
come sit down with me and be a good boy. Do you want to give me your
name? I wish you really were <u>somebody</u> that had given Willie
that tea fight." And while making protestations and remonstrances I
was led again into that tea room and seated at a great distance from
the table which had been occupied by that Mr. William Raines and Mr.
Peter Scudder, who had now departed. "If you really were some big gun
it would kill Willie dead."
</p><p>"Then, Madam, permit me to present myself to you as Robert Carruthers,
Marquis de Grez and Bye, from Paris on my way to visit my Uncle,
General Robert Carruthers, of the State of Harpeth. I would very
willingly by information or a sword kill that Mr. William Raines of
Saint Louis and I regret that--that--" At the beginning of my sentence
I had drawn myself up into the attitude of the old Marquis of Flanders
in the hall of the ruined Chateau de Grez, but when I had got to the
point--of, shall I say, my own sword?--I was forced to collapse and I
could feel my knees under the tea table begin to shake together and
huddle for their accustomed and now missing skirts.
</p><p>"That's fine and dandy," answered the nice woman as she began to write
rapidly upon the blank paper. "If you'd drawn fifty swords on Willie
and he had knocked you down with the butt end of his teaspoon I'd have
put Willie on the run in my write-up. Willie has handed me several
little blows below the belt that I don't like. Pretends not to have
met me, when Peter Scudder's own sister, whom I knew at the
settlement, introduced him to me; and what he did to Mabel Wright, our
cub on weddings--Oh, well, Mabel is another story. Now--that copy is
ready to turn in when I pad it. I wonder if I will get a favor from
the manager or be turned out of the tea room permanently for reporting
a fight as aristocratic as this in the sacred halls of the
Ritz-Carlton. I'd bet my shoe lacings that fifty people come here
every afternoon for a week hoping it will happen again."
</p><p>"I do like this America, whose movement is so rapid," I made remark as
I set down my second cup of tea for the afternoon, this one emptied
into my depths instead of the face of Mr. Saint Louis.
</p><p>"That's good, too," returned my new-found friend with a laugh as she
again wrote a word or two on the nice white paper. Then she placed her
elbow upon the table, leaned her very firm cheek on her hand, and
regarded me with fine and honest and sympathetic eyes. "I wonder what
America is going to do to a beautiful boy like you. I'm glad that you
are going to beat it to the tall timbers of the Harpeth Valley. There
are women in New York who would eat you up alive. There's La Frigeda,
alias Maggie Sullivan from Milwaukee, over there devouring you with
her eyes at this moment, and that pretty little Stuyvesant Blaine
debutante hasn't taken her eyes off of you long enough to eat her
spiced ice. I know 'em both and could land something from either one
if I introduced you in your title and very beautiful clothes."
</p><p>"Oh, I beg a pardon of you that I have not the time to have an
introduction to your friends," I exclaimed with a very true regret,
because I did like that very nice woman and would have liked much to
have brought advantage to her. "In less than an hour I must 'beat' to
those 'tall timbers of Harpeth' you mention."
</p><p>"Speaking of the State of Harpeth, I don't know as you'll be so safe
after all, young friend, if that is any sample of the variety of women
that flower in that classic land of the cotton and the magnolia which
I met at Mrs. Creed Payne's war baby tea the other afternoon," mused
my fine friend as I paid the <u>garçon</u> for the very good tea. "She
is in high-up political circles down there in Old Harpeth and from the
bunch of women she was with I make a guess she is taking an interest
in war contracts. She was with that Mrs. Benton, who pulled off that
spectacular deal for desiccated soups for Greece the other day. My
stomach is too delicate to feed soldiers dried dog and rotten cabbage
melted down into glue in a can, but they may like the idea if not the
soup. Anyway, the woman was a beauty, so don't you let her get you."
</p><p>"I do not entirely understand you, my dear Madam, and I wish that I
might have many days to talk with you about these American customs," I
said as I put into my pocket the exchange money handed to me by the
<u>garçon</u>.
</p><p>"Well, it is not exactly an American custom I have been putting you
next to, and I guess I'm patriotically glad that you don't entirely
understand. Now, I'm going to put you on the train for Old Harpeth and
kiss you good-bye for your mother. I'm not trusting Frigeda, and she's
lingering. Come on if your train leaves at six o'clock."
</p><p>And while she spoke, my interesting and fine woman rose and allowed me
to assist her into her gray coat of tweed that was very like to mine.
</p><p>It was with regret that I parted from that lady at the door of the
taxicab that had been called for her, and I bent over and kissed her
hand, the first woman that Mr. Robert Carruthers had ever so saluted.
</p><p>"Good-bye, boy! Remember, the tall timbers of Harpeth are best. Run
right down and get a Southern belle and beauty to settle down and have
a dozen babies for you, just like 'befo' the war.' Good-bye! I'll send
you down a paper to-morrow. I don't suppose the New York journals ever
penetrate the Harpeth Valley. Good-bye again." And then my friend was
gone, leaving me once more alone in New York and very shy of those
tweed trousers, which I immediately put with me into another taxicab
which was directed to the Pennsylvania Station.
</p><p>At that Pennsylvania Station I remembered to send to my wicked Uncle
an announcement by telegram of my arrival to him and then I got upon
the train just in time for its departure.
</p><p>I have remarked that life is like high waves of fate that break in
sparkling white crests over buried mines, and I am now led to believe
that many of those mines are but the habitation of mermaids of much
mischief. Are all ripples on life due to women at the bottom of the
matter? I do not know, but it would seem true from the things that
immediately began to befall me. And was it not I, a woman who was
called daredevil, who began it all?
</p><p>These Pullman cars of America in which to travel great distances, are
very remarkable for their many strange adventures, and I was very much
interested but also perturbed when the black <u>garçon</u> placed my
bag and overcoat upon the floor at the feet of a very prim lady and
left me to stand uncomfortably in the aisle before her.
</p><p>"Your seat, sir, upper five," he said, and departed with my fifty
centimes, which is called a dime in America.
</p><p>In the little division which I could see was marked five were two nice
seats that were to each other face to face, but it appeared that
neither of them was vacant for Mr. Robert Carruthers. On one the lady
sat with very stiff black silk skirts projecting from her sides, as
did her thin elbows also in the stiffness of white linen. Beside her,
occupying the rest of her seat, was a hat with large black bows of
equal stiffness with the rest of the lady's apparel and disposition
not to be friendly. On the seat opposite, which from the nature of my
ticket and the case I should have supposed belonged to me, were piled
two large bundles, a shiny black bag, a black silk coat, also stiff
like the lady, an umbrella, two magazines and a basket of fruit. No
place was apparent for me or my bags or my overcoat. It seemed as if
it would be best for me to stand in the middle of the car all the way
to the State of Harpeth so that the lady's stiffness be not
disarranged. I did not know what I should do, and my knees began again
to feel weak in that gray tweed and to be cold for their accustomed
skirts, but the lady looked out of the window and said not a single
word. I did not have any convenient cup of tea in my hand to throw in
that lady's face in a manner that would not be permitted a gentleman,
but if I had had the very lovely lorgnette that has descended to me
from my Great Grandmamma, the wife of the old Flanders grandsire, I
would have settled the matter with very little trouble in an entirely
ladylike manner. As it was, I did not know what to do but stand and
then stand longer. Just at the moment when I began to feel that I
would either be forced to forget that I was a gentleman or to faint as
a lady, a very nice man touched me on the elbow and said:
</p><p>"Just drop your bag on her feet and come into the smoker. She's got
your game beat," and he passed on down the aisle of that car. I acted
upon that very kind advice and I am glad that from the weight of the
bag I got at least a small action from the stiff lady if only a groan
and a glare. Also I should have been grateful that she had so
discourteously treated me so that I was fortunate to receive the
attention of Mr. George Slade of Detroit as my first experience in
American manhood.
</p><p>That Mr. Slade of Detroit is a man of remarkable adventures, and he
related to me many of them as he sat with me in the place reserved for
the smoking of gentlemen. They were all about ladies who resided in
the different towns to which he traveled in the pursuit of selling
cigars, and he called them all by the name of "skirts."
</p><p>"I tell you, Mr. Dago, there is a skirt in Louisville, Kentucky, that
is such a peach that you'd call for the cream jug on sight. It would
pay you to stop off and see her. She's on the level all right, but any
friend that took a line from me would be nuts to her. See?" And he
bestowed upon me a pleasant wink from his eye. To that I made no
response. I could make none.
</p><p>"Now, Mr. Robert Carruthers," I had said to myself at the beginning of
the first story of "skirts," "you will find yourself obliged to be in
the presence of men as one of their kind and not throw scalding tea in
their faces when they speak of ladies. You are of a great ignorance
about the brute that is known as man and you must learn to know him as
you do the wild hog in hunting." But even for the sake of a larger
education I could not remain, and I fled from that Mr. Slade of
Detroit in one half hour back to the arms of the stiff lady. But when
I arrived there I found she had had me removed from her as far as
possible to the other end of the car, where I found my bags deposited
beside one marked "G. Slade, Detroit."
</p><p>"Took the liberty of transferring you here above the other gentleman,
sir. The lady is nervous," said the conductor of the car as he handed
me another ticket.
</p><p>"Right, old top," said that Mr. G. Slade as he stood beside us, having
followed. "If you don't enjoy sleeping rock-a-bye-baby we can put our
togs up and you can bunk in with me. I'm not nervous." And with a
glance at the very stiff black silk back in the front of the car he
made a laugh that I could not prevent myself from sharing. It is then
that the delicacy of a woman is so easily corrupted?
</p><p>"I beg your pardon, conductor, but upper nine is engaged for my son
who is to get on at Philadelphia. I must have him just opposite my
daughter and me. We are nervous." And as the large and pathetic lady
across the aisle from number nine spoke in a most timid voice, that
Mr. G. Slade gave one glance at the daughter of whom she spoke, who
also must have weighed a great many litre, or what you call in
America, pounds, and fled back to the smoking apartment.
</p><p>It was a very funny sight to behold that small conductor stand with my
large bags and overcoat and look around at that car full of ladies for
a place in which to deposit me and them, which was not previously
occupied by some female of great nervousness.
</p><p>"Madam, I will have to use the upper of this section," he finally
turned and said to the occupant of the number of seven with a very
fine determination.
</p><p>"Certainly, conductor; let me remove my hat and coat," came back the
answer in a voice of very great sweetness as the conductor deposited
me and my bags down in front of the most beautiful lady in all
America, I am sure.
</p><p>"Thank you for much graciousness, Madam," I said, keeping those gray
tweed knees straight out in front of me and very still to prevent
trembling.
</p><p>"Not at all, sir; I only bought the lower half of this section. I am
not at all <u>nervous</u>," and I could see her mouth that was curled
like the petals of an opening rose tremble from a mischief as she
regarded the stiff black silk back in the front of the car and the two
huge females on our right whose son and brother was to arrive in
Philadelphia for their protection.
</p><p>An equally gay mischief rose in my eyes and responded to that in hers
as I responded also by word:
</p><p>"For which also let us be in gratitude."
</p><p>Many times in the months that followed have I thought of the lure of
the laughing mischief in those eyes that were like beautiful blue
flowers set in crystal, and how they were to lead me on into the
strange land of men in search of those forbidden fruits. They were the
first to offer me affection, excepting perhaps my fine reporter woman
with the paper and pencil.
</p><p>And from that moment on I did very much enjoy myself in conversation
with that Madam Mischief, while we together did watch the retirement
of all of the persons in the train. She had many funny remarks to make
and made me merry with them so that the hour of eleven o'clock had
arrived before we had summoned the very black male chamber-maid to
turn our seats into beds. All others were in sleep that was a
confusion of sound from everywhere and we must stand in the aisle
while the beds were being abstracted.
</p><p>"Shall I take your bag into the dressing room, sah?" said the black
male chamber-maid as if to intimate that I should leave the aisle free
for his operations.
</p><p>"Many thanks, yes," I answered him. "Good night, Madam, and to you
again much gratitude for the happiness of an evening," and with all
sincerity I directed Mr. Robert Carruthers to bend over her very white
hand and kiss it with much fervor that was resulted from the
loneliness of the poor Marquise of Grez and Bye, who was but a girl in
a strange and large land, although habited in trousers and coat.
</p><p>"You are a dear boy," she made answer to me with an equal affection as
she disappeared into the curtains of her small room. Then I departed
to that room reserved for the disrobing of gentlemen. It was without
occupation and I opened my large bag and procured the very beautiful
silk night robing that the kind man had sold to me that afternoon. It
was in two pieces that very much resembled the costume in which
gentlemen play tennis, only more ornamented by silk embroidery and
braid and buttons. I was regarding them with joy when into the small
room came that Mr. G. Slade of Detroit. He was appareled in garments
of the same cut only of a very wide red stripe, his hair was very much
in confusion and he had a bottle in his hand in which was a liquid the
color of cognac.
</p><p>"I've only been awake for two hours listening to that peach of a skirt
trying to make you fuss her a bit, and I thought I would bring you a
nip to pick you up after your fight. Gee, it is as I suspected. You
are off on a wedding tango and that makes you cold to all wiles! My
son, for a wedding garment that thing you have in your hand is a
winner. I can't sleep in silk myself because it makes me feel like a
wet dog, but you'll be so beautiful in them that the bride will be
jealous of you and say that even if you are so pretty now you will
fade early or that you buy your complexion at the corner emporium. Go
on, put 'em on, or was you just looking at 'em for pleasure and going
to save 'em by sleeping 'as is'? Me, I always undress to the skin, but
some don't."
</p><p>"I--I was just looking at them with pleasure," I made haste to answer
that Mr. G. Slade of Detroit. "When upon travels I always fear to
disrobe myself. I think that I will now retire," and with a haste that
made my hands tremble I replaced the sleeping garments in the large
bag and prepared to flee down the aisle to the sleeping apartment in
which was the protection of another woman's presence.
</p><p>"Not even a nip before you go?" he asked me as he held the large
bottle to his lips and threw back his head for a gurgling down his
throat.
</p><p>"No, with much gratitude, and good night," I answered as I rapidly
departed with my cheeks in a flame of scarlet and a fear in my heart.
In my flight I passed by that number of seven and came very near
opening the curtains of the number of five and precipitating myself
upon the bayonets of black taffeta that stood firm from a hat so
placed as to bar my intrusion. From that accident I turned and sought
the kind black male chamber-maid with a request that he show me how to
insert myself into the right place for sleeping.
</p><p>"Right here, Boss. Climb up on these little steps and then hand me
down your shoes. Soft now; I think the lady am asleep."
</p><p>"Good night, and I'm not nervous," I heard a laugh of mischief come
from behind a second and short green curtain, that veils the lower of
the sleeping shelves, just as I fell onto my shelf above and lay with
a panting of relief.
