<p>At the end of our journey it is time to return to the question
from which we set out, namely: What is it that characterizes mind
as opposed to matter? Or, to state the same question in other
terms: How is psychology to be distinguished from physics? The
answer provisionally suggested at the outset of our inquiry was
that psychology and physics are distinguished by the nature of
their causal laws, not by their subject matter. At the same time
we held that there is a certain subject matter, namely images,
to which only psychological causal laws are applicable; this subject
matter, therefore, we assigned exclusively to psychology. But
we found no way of defining images except through their causation;
in their intrinsic character they appeared to have no universal
mark by which they could be distinguished from sensations.</p>

<p>In this last lecture I propose to pass in review various suggested
methods of distinguishing mind from matter. I shall then briefly
sketch the nature of that fundamental science which I believe
to be the true metaphysic, in which mind and matter alike are
seen to be constructed out of a neutral stuff, whose causal laws
have no such duality as that of psychology, but form the basis
upon which both physics and psychology are built.</p>

<p>In search for the definition of "mental phenomena," let us begin
with "consciousness," which is often thought to be the essence
of mind. In the first lecture I gave various arguments against
the view that consciousness is fundamental, but I did not attempt
to say what consciousness is. We must find a definition of it,
if we are to feel secure in deciding that it is not fundamental.
It is for the sake of the proof that it is not fundamental that
we must now endeavour to decide what it is.</p>

<p>"Consciousness," by those who regard it as fundamental, is taken
to be a character diffused throughout our mental life, distinct
from sensations and images, memories, beliefs and desires, but
present in all of them.* Dr. Henry Head, in an article which I
quoted in Lecture <em>III, </em>distinguishing sensations from
purely physiological occurrences, says: "Sensation, in the strict
sense of the term, demands the existence of consciousness." This
statement, at first sight, is one to which we feel inclined to
assent, but I believe we are mistaken if we do so. Sensation is
the sort of thing of which we <em>MAY </em>be conscious, but not
a thing of which we <em>MUST </em>be conscious. We have been led,
in the course of our inquiry, to admit unconscious beliefs and
unconscious desires. There is, so far as I can see, no class of
mental or other occurrences of which we are always conscious whenever
they happen.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The first thing to notice is that consciousness must be of something.
In view of this, I should define "consciousness" in terms of that
relation of an image of a word to an object which we defined,
in Lecture XI, as "meaning." When a sensation is followed by an
image which is a "copy" of it, I think it may be said that the
existence of the image constitutes consciousness of the sensation,
provided it is accompanied by that sort of belief which, when
we reflect upon it, makes us feel that the image is a "sign" of
something other than itself. This is the sort of belief which,
in the case of memory, we expressed in the words "this occurred";
or which, in the case of a judgment of perception, makes us believe
in qualities correlated with present sensations, as e.g., tactile
and visual qualities are correlated. The addition of some element
of belief seems required, since mere imagination does not involve
consciousness of anything, and there can be no consciousness which
is not of something. If images alone constituted consciousness
of their prototypes, such imagination-images as in fact have prototypes
would involve consciousness of them; since this is not the case,
an element of belief must be added to the images in defining consciousness.
The belief must be of that sort that constitutes objective reference,
past or present. An image, together with a belief of this sort
concerning it, constitutes, according to our definition, consciousness
of the prototype of the image.</p>

<p>But when we pass from consciousness of sensations to consciousness
of objects of perception, certain further points arise which demand
an addition to our definition. A judgment of perception, we may
say, consists of a core of sensation, together with associated
images, with belief in the present existence of an object to which
sensation and images are referred in a way which is difficult
to analyse. Perhaps we might say that the belief is not fundamentally
in any <em>PRESENT </em>existence, but is of the nature of an
expectation: for example, when we see an object, we expect certain
sensations to result if we proceed to touch it. Perception, then,
will consist of a present sensation together with expectations
of future sensations. (This, of course, is a reflective analysis,
not an account of the way perception appears to unchecked introspection.)
But all such expectations are liable to be erroneous, since they
are based upon correlations which are usual but not invariable.
Any such correlation may mislead us in a particular case, for
example, if we try to touch a reflection in a looking-glass under
the impression that it is "real." Since memory is fallible, a
similar difficulty arises as regards consciousness of past objects.
It would seem odd to say that we can be "conscious" of a thing
which does not or did not exist. The only way to avoid this awkwardness
is to add to our definition the proviso that the beliefs involved
in consciousness must be <em>TRUE</em>.</p>

<p>In the second place, the question arises as to whether we can
be conscious of images. If we apply our definition to this case,
it seems to demand images of images. In order, for example, to
be conscious of an image of a cat, we shall require, according
to the letter of the definition, an image which is a copy of our
image of the cat, and has this image for its prototype. Now, it
hardly seems probable, as a matter of observation, that there
are images of images, as opposed to images of sensations. We may
meet this difficulty in two ways, either by boldly denying consciousness
of images, or by finding a sense in which, by means of a different
accompanying belief, an image, instead of meaning its prototype,
can mean another image of the same prototype.</p>

<p>The first alternative, which denies consciousness of images,
has already been discussed when we were dealing with Introspection
in Lecture <em>VI. </em>We then decided that there must be, in
some sense, consciousness of images. We are therefore left with
the second suggested way of dealing with knowledge of images.
According to this second hypothesis, there may be two images of
the same prototype, such that one of them means the other, instead
of meaning the prototype. It will be remembered that we defined
meaning by association a word or image means an object, we said,
when it has the same associations as the object. But this definition
must not be interpreted too absolutely: a word or image will not
have <em>ALL </em>the same associations as the object which it
means. The word "cat" may be associated with the word "mat," but
it would not happen except by accident that a cat would be associated
with a mat. And in like manner an image may have certain associations
which its prototype will not have, e.g. an association with the
word "image." When these associations are active, an image means
an image, instead of meaning its prototype. If I have had images
of a given prototype many times, I can mean one of these, as opposed
to the rest, by recollecting the time and place or any other distinctive
association of that one occasion. This happens, for example, when
a place recalls to us some thought we previously had in that place,
so that we remember a thought as opposed to the occurrence to
which it referred. Thus we may say that we think of an image A
when we have a similar image B associated with recollections of
circumstances connected with A, but not with its prototype or
with other images of the same prototype. In this way we become
aware of images without the need of any new store of mental contents,
merely by the help of new associations. This theory, so far as
I can see, solves the problems of introspective knowledge, without
requiring heroic measures such as those proposed by Knight Dunlap,
whose views we discussed in Lecture VI.</p>

<p>According to what we have been saying, sensation itself is not
an instance of consciousness, though the immediate memory by which
it is apt to be succeeded is so. A sensation which is remembered
becomes an object of consciousness as soon as it begins to be
remembered, which will normally be almost immediately after its
occurrence (if at all); but while it exists it is not an object
of consciousness. If, however, it is part of a perception, say
of some familiar person, we may say that the person perceived
is an object of consciousness. For in this case the sensation
is a <em>SIGN </em>of the perceived object in much the same way
in which a memory-image is a sign of a remembered object. The
essential practical function of "consciousness" and "thought"
is that they enable us to act with reference to what is distant
in time or space, even though it is not at present stimulating
our senses. This reference to absent objects is possible through
association and habit. Actual sensations, in themselves, are not
cases of consciousness, because they do not bring in this reference
to what is absent. But their connection with consciousness is
very close, both through immediate memory, and through the correlations
which turn sensations into perceptions.</p>

<p>Enough has, I hope, been said to show that consciousness is far
too complex and accidental to be taken as the fundamental characteristic
of mind. We have seen that belief and images both enter into it.
Belief itself, as we saw in an earlier lecture, is complex. Therefore,
if any definition of mind is suggested by our analysis of consciousness,
images are what would naturally suggest themselves. But since
we found that images can only be defined causally, we cannot deal
with this suggestion, except in connection with the difference
between physical and psychological causal laws.</p>

<p>I come next to those characteristics of mental phenomena which
arise out of mnemic causation. The possibility of action with
reference to what is not sensibly present is one of the things
that might be held to characterize mind. Let us take first a very
elementary example. Suppose you are in a familiar room at night,
and suddenly the light goes out. You will be able to find your
way to the door without much difficulty by means of the picture
of the room which you have in your mind. In this case visual images
serve, somewhat imperfectly it is true, the purpose which visual
sensations would otherwise serve. The stimulus to the production
of visual images is the desire to get out of the room, which,
according to what we found in Lecture <em>III, </em>consists essentially
of present sensations and motor impulses caused by them. Again,
words heard or read enable you to act with reference to the matters
about which they give information; here, again, a present sensible
stimulus, in virtue of habits formed in the past, enables you
to act in a manner appropriate to an object which is not sensibly
present. The whole essence of the practical efficiency of "thought"
consists in sensitiveness to signs: the sensible presence of A,
which is a sign of the present or future existence of B, enables
us to act in a manner appropriate to B. Of this, words are the
supreme example, since their effects as signs are prodigious,
while their intrinsic interest as sensible occurrences on their
own account is usually very slight. The operation of signs may
or may not be accompanied by consciousness. If a sensible stimulus
A calls up an image of B, and we then act with reference to B,
we have what may be called consciousness of B. But habit may enable
us to act in a manner appropriate to B as soon as A appears, without
ever having an image of B. In that case, although A operates as
a sign, it operates without the help of consciousness. Broadly
speaking, a very familiar sign tends to operate directly in this
manner, and the intervention of consciousness marks an imperfectly
established habit.</p>

<p>The power of acquiring experience, which characterizes men and
animals, is an example of the general law that, in mnemic causation,
the causal unit is not one event at one time, but two or more
events at two or more times.&amp; A burnt child fears the fire,
that is to say, the neighbourhood of fire has a different effect
upon a child which has had the sensations of burning than upon
one which has not. More correctly, the observed effect, when a
child which has been burnt is put near a fire, has for its cause,
not merely the neighbourhood of the fire, but this together with
the previous burning. The general formula, when an animal has
acquired experience through some event A, is that, when B occurs
at some future time, the animal to which A has happened acts differently
from an animal which A has not happened. Thus A and B together,
not either separately, must be regarded as the cause of the animal's
behaviour, unless we take account of the effect which A has had
in altering the animal's nervous tissue, which is a matter not
patent to external observation except under very special circumstances.
With this possibility, we are brought back to causal laws, and
to the suggestion that many things which seem essentially mental
are really neural. Perhaps it is the nerves that acquire experience
rather than the mind. If so, the possibility of acquiring experience
cannot be used to define mind.*</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Very similar considerations apply to memory, if taken as the
essence of mind. A recollection is aroused by something which
is happening now, but is different from the effect which the present
occurrence would have produced if the recollected event had not
occurred. This may be accounted for by the physical effect of
the past event on the brain, making it a different instrument
from that which would have resulted from a different experience.
The causal peculiarities of memory may, therefore, have a physiological
explanation. With every special class of mental phenomena this
possibility meets us afresh. If psychology is to be a separate
science at all, we must seek a wider ground for its separateness
than any that we have been considering hitherto.</p>

<p>We have found that "consciousness" is too narrow to characterize
mental phenomena, and that mnemic causation is too wide. I come
now to a characteristic which, though difficult to define, comes
much nearer to what we require, namely subjectivity.</p>

<p>Subjectivity, as a characteristic of mental phenomena, was considered
in Lecture <em>VII, </em>in connection with the definition of
perception. We there decided that those particulars which constitute
the physical world can be collected into sets in two ways, one
of which makes a bundle of all those particulars that are appearances
of a given thing from different places, while the other makes
a bundle of all those particulars which are appearances of different
things from a given place. A bundle of this latter sort, at a
given time, is called a "perspective"; taken throughout a period
of time, it is called a "biography." Subjectivity is the characteristic
of perspectives and biographies, the characteristic of giving
the view of the world from a certain place. We saw in Lecture
<em>VII </em>that this characteristic involves none of the other
characteristics that are commonly associated with mental phenomena,
such as consciousness, experience and memory. We found in fact
that it is exhibited by a photographic plate, and, strictly speaking,
by any particular taken in conjunction with those which have the
same "passive" place in the sense defined in Lecture <em>VII.
</em>The particulars forming one perspective are connected together
primarily by simultaneity; those forming one biography, primarily
by the existence of direct time-relations between them. To these
are to be added relations derivable from the laws of perspective.
In all this we are clearly not in the region of psychology, as
commonly understood; yet we are also hardly in the region of physics.
And the definition of perspectives and biographies, though it
does not yet yield anything that would be commonly called "mental,"
is presupposed in mental phenomena, for example in mnemic causation:
the causal unit in mnemic causation, which gives rise to Semon's
engram, is the whole of one perspective&mdash;not of any perspective,
but of a perspective in a place where there is nervous tissue,
or at any rate living tissue of some sort. Perception also, as
we saw, can only be defined in terms of perspectives. Thus the
conception of subjectivity, i.e. of the "passive" place of a particular,
though not alone sufficient to define mind, is clearly an essential
element in the definition.</p>

<p>I have maintained throughout these lectures that the data of
psychology do not differ in, their intrinsic character from the
data of physics. I have maintained that sensations are data for
psychology and physics equally, while images, which may be in
some sense exclusively psychological data, can only be distinguished
from sensations by their correlations, not by what they are in
themselves. It is now necessary, however, to examine the notion
of a "datum," and to obtain, if possible, a definition of this
notion.</p>

<p>The notion of "data" is familiar throughout science, and is usually
treated by men of science as though it were perfectly clear. Psychologists,
on the other hand, find great difficulty in the conception. "Data"
are naturally defined in terms of theory of knowledge: they are
those propositions of which the truth is known without demonstration,
so that they may be used as premisses in proving other propositions.
Further, when a proposition which is a datum asserts the existence
of something, we say that the something is a datum, as well as
the proposition asserting its existence. Thus those objects of
whose existence we become certain through perception are said
to be data.</p>

<p>There is some difficulty in connecting this epistemological definition
of "data" with our psychological analysis of knowledge; but until
such a connection has been effected, we have no right to use the
conception "data."</p>

<p>It is clear, in the first place, that there can be no datum apart
from a belief. A sensation which merely comes and goes is not
a datum; it only becomes a datum when it is remembered. Similarly,
in perception, we do not have a datum unless we have a <em>JUDGMENT
</em>of perception. In the sense in which objects (as opposed
to propositions) are data, it would seem natural to say that those
objects of which we are conscious are data. But consciousness,
as we have seen, is a complex notion, involving beliefs, as well
as mnemic phenomena such as are required for perception and memory.
It follows that no datum is theoretically indubitable, since no
belief is infallible; it follows also that every datum has a greater
or less degree of vagueness, since there is always some vagueness
in memory and the meaning of images.</p>

<p>Data are not those things of which our consciousness is earliest
in time. At every period of life, after we have become capable
of thought, some of our beliefs are obtained by inference, while
others are not. A belief may pass from either of these classes
into the other, and may therefore become, or cease to be, a belief
giving a datum. When, in what follows, I speak of data, I do not
mean the things of which we feel sure before scientific study
begins, but the things which, when a science is well advanced,
appear as affording grounds for other parts of the science, without
themselves being believed on any ground except observation. I
assume, that is to say, a trained observer, with an analytic attention,
knowing the sort of thing to look for, and the sort of thing that
will be important. What he observes is, at the stage of science
which he has reached, a datum for his science. It is just as sophisticated
and elaborate as the theories which he bases upon it, since only
trained habits and much practice enable a man to make the kind
of observation that will be scientifically illuminating. Nevertheless,
when once it has been observed, belief in it is not based on inference
and reasoning, but merely upon its having been seen. In this way
its logical status differs from that of the theories which are
proved by its means.</p>

<p>In any science other than psychology the datum is primarily a
perception, in which only the sensational core is ultimately and
theoretically a datum, though some such accretions as turn the
sensation into a perception are practically unavoidable. But if
we postulate an ideal observer, he will be able to isolate the
sensation, and treat this alone as datum. There is, therefore,
an important sense in which we may say that, if we analyse as
much as we ought, our data, outside psychology, consist of sensations,
which include within themselves certain spatial and temporal relations.</p>

<p>Applying this remark to physiology, we see that the nerves and
brain as physical objects are not truly data; they are to be replaced,
in the ideal structure of science, by the sensations through which
the physiologist is said to perceive them. The passage from these
sensations to nerves and brain as physical objects belongs really
to the initial stage in the theory of physics, and ought to be
placed in the reasoned part, not in the part supposed to be observed.
To say we see the nerves is like saying we hear the nightingale;
both are convenient but inaccurate expressions. We hear a sound
which we believe to be causally connected with the nightingale,
and we see a sight which we believe to be causally connected with
a nerve. But in each case it is only the sensation that ought,
in strictness, to be called a datum. Now, sensations are certainly
among the data of psychology. Therefore all the data of the physical
sciences are also psychological data. It remains to inquire whether
all the data of psychology are also data of physical science,
and especially of physiology.</p>

<p>If we have been right in our analysis of mind, the ultimate data
of psychology are only sensations and images and their relations.
Beliefs, desires, volitions, and so on, appeared to us to be complex
phenomena consisting of sensations and images variously interrelated.
Thus (apart from certain relations) the occurrences which seem
most distinctively mental, and furthest removed from physics,
are, like physical objects, constructed or inferred, not part
of the original stock of data in the perfected science. From both
ends, therefore, the difference between physical and psychological
data is diminished. Is there ultimately no difference, or do images
remain as irreducibly and exclusively psychological? In view of
the causal definition of the difference between images and sensations,
this brings us to a new question, namely: Are the causal laws
of psychology different from those of any other science, or are
they really physiological?</p>

<p>Certain ambiguities must be removed before this question can
be adequately discussed.</p>

<p>First, there is the distinction between rough approximate laws
and such as appear to be precise and general. I shall return to
the former presently; it is the latter that I wish to discuss
now.</p>

<p>Matter, as defined at the end of Lecture V, is a logical fiction,
invented because it gives a convenient way of stating causal laws.
Except in cases of perfect regularity in appearances (of which
we can have no experience), the actual appearances of a piece
of matter are not members of that ideal system of regular appearances
which is defined as being the matter in question. But the matter
is, after all, inferred from its appearances, which are used to
<em>VERIFY </em>physical laws. Thus, in so far as physics is an
empirical and verifiable science, it must assume or prove that
the inference from appearances to matter is, in general, legitimate,
and it must be able to tell us, more or less, what appearances
to expect. It is through this question of verifiability and empirical
applicability to experience that we are led to a theory of matter
such as I advocate. From the consideration of this question it
results that physics, in so far as it is an empirical science,
not a logical phantasy, is concerned with particulars of just
the same sort as those which psychology considers under the name
of sensations. The causal laws of physics, so interpreted, differ
from those of psychology only by the fact that they connect a
particular with other appearances in the same piece of matter,
rather than with other appearances in the same perspective. That
is to say, they group together particulars having the same "active"
place, while psychology groups together those having the same
"passive" place. Some particulars, such as images, have no "active"
place, and therefore belong exclusively to psychology.</p>

<p>We can now understand the distinction between physics and psychology.
The nerves and brain are matter: our visual sensations when we
look at them may be, and I think are, members of the system constituting
irregular appearances of this matter, but are not the whole of
the system. Psychology is concerned, inter alia, with our sensations
when we see a piece of matter, as opposed to the matter which
we see. Assuming, as we must, that our sensations have physical
causes, their causal laws are nevertheless radically different
from the laws of physics, since the consideration of a single
sensation requires the breaking up of the group of which it is
a member. When a sensation is used to verify physics, it is used
merely as a sign of a certain material phenomenon, i.e. of a group
of particulars of which it is a member. But when it is studied
by psychology, it is taken away from that group and put into quite
a different context, where it causes images or voluntary movements.
It is primarily this different grouping that is characteristic
of psychology as opposed to all the physical sciences, including
physiology; a secondary difference is that images, which belong
to psychology, are not easily to be included among the aspects
which constitute a physical thing or piece of matter.</p>

<p>There remains, however, an important question, namely: Are mental
events causally dependent upon physical events in a sense in which
the converse dependence does not hold? Before we can discuss the
answer to this question, we must first be clear as to what our
question means.</p>

<p>When, given A, it is possible to infer B, but given B, it is
not possible to infer A, we say that B is dependent upon A in
a sense in which A is not dependent upon B. Stated in logical
terms, this amounts to saying that, when we know a many-one relation
of A to B, B is dependent upon A in respect of this relation.
If the relation is a causal law, we say that B is causally dependent
upon A. The illustration that chiefly concerns us is the system
of appearances of a physical object. We can, broadly speaking,
infer distant appearances from near ones, but not vice versa.
All men look alike when they are a mile away, hence when we see
a man a mile off we cannot tell what he will look like when he
is only a yard away. But when we see him a yard away, we can tell
what he will look like a mile away. Thus the nearer view gives
us more valuable information, and the distant view is causally
dependent upon it in a sense in which it is not causally dependent
upon the distant view.</p>

<p>It is this greater causal potency of the near appearance that
leads physics to state its causal laws in terms of that system
of regular appearances to which the nearest appearances increasingly
approximate, and that makes it value information derived from
the microscope or telescope. It is clear that our sensations,
considered as irregular appearances of physical objects, share
the causal dependence belonging to comparatively distant appearances;
therefore in our sensational life we are in causal dependence
upon physical laws.</p>

<p>This, however, is not the most important or interesting part
of our question. It is the causation of images that is the vital
problem. We have seen that they are subject to mnenic causation,
and that mnenic causation may be reducible to ordinary physical
causation in nervous tissue. This is the question upon which our
attitude must turn towards what may be called materialism. One
sense of materialism is the view that all mental phenomena are
causally dependent upon physical phenomena in the above-defined
sense of causal dependence. Whether this is the case or not, I
do not profess to know. The question seems to me the same as the
question whether mnemic causation is ultimate, which we considered
without deciding in Lecture <em>IV. </em>But I think the bulk
of the evidence points to the materialistic answer as the more
probable.</p>

<p>In considering the causal laws of psychology, the distinction
between rough generalizations and exact laws is important. There
are many rough generalizations in psychology, not only of the
sort by which we govern our ordinary behaviour to each other,
but also of a more nearly scientific kind. Habit and association
belong among such laws. I will give an illustration of the kind
of law that can be obtained. Suppose a person has frequently experienced
A and B in close temporal contiguity, an association will be established,
so that A, or an image of A, tends to cause an image of B. The
question arises: will the association work in either direction,
or only from the one which has occurred earlier to the one which
has occurred later? In an article by Mr. Wohlgemuth, called "The
Direction of Associations" ("British Journal of Psychology," vol.
v, part iv, March, 1913), it is claimed to be proved by experiment
that, in so far as motor memory (i.e. memory of movements) is
concerned, association works only from earlier to later, while
in visual and auditory memory this is not the case, but the later
of two neighbouring experiences may recall the earlier as well
as the earlier the later. It is suggested that motor memory is
physiological, while visual and auditory memory are more truly
psychological. But that is not the point which concerns us in
the illustration. The point which concerns us is that a law of
association, established by purely psychological observation,
is a purely psychological law, and may serve as a sample of what
is possible in the way of discovering such laws. It is, however,
still no more than a rough generalization, a statistical average.
It cannot tell us what will result from a given cause on a given
occasion. It is a law of tendency, not a precise and invariable
law such as those of physics aim at being.</p>

<p>If we wish to pass from the law of habit, stated as a tendency
or average, to something more precise and invariable, we seem
driven to the nervous system. We can more or less guess how an
occurrence produces a change in the brain, and how its repetition
gradually produces something analogous to the channel of a river,
along which currents flow more easily than in neighbouring paths.
We can perceive that in this way, if we had more knowledge, the
tendency to habit through repetition might be replaced by a precise
account of the effect of each occurrence in bringing about a modification
of the sort from which habit would ultimately result. It is such
considerations that make students of psychophysiology materialistic
in their methods, whatever they may be in their metaphysics. There
are, of course, exceptions, such as Professor J. S. Haldane,*
who maintains that it is theoretically impossible to obtain physiological
explanations of psychical phenomena, or physical explanations
of physiological phenomena. But I think the bulk of expert opinion,
in practice, is on the other side.</p>

</div>
<p>The question whether it is possible to obtain precise causal
laws in which the causes are psychological, not material, is one
of detailed investigation. I have done what I could to make clear
the nature of the question, but I do not believe that it is possible
as yet to answer it with any confidence. It seems to be by no
means an insoluble question, and we may hope that science will
be able to produce sufficient grounds for regarding one answer
as much more probable than the other. But for the moment I do
not see how we can come to a decision.</p>

<p>I think, however, on grounds of the theory of matter explained
in Lectures V and <em>VII, </em>that an ultimate scientific account
of what goes on in the world, if it were ascertainable, would
resemble psychology rather than physics in what we found to be
the decisive difference between them. I think, that is to say,
that such an account would not be content to speak, even formally,
as though matter, which is a logical fiction, were the ultimate
reality. I think that, if our scientific knowledge were adequate
to the task, which it neither is nor is likely to become, it would
exhibit the laws of correlation of the particulars constituting
a momentary condition of a material unit, and would state the
causal laws* of the world in terms of these particulars, not in
terms of matter. Causal laws so stated would, I believe, be applicable
to psychology and physics equally; the science in which they were
stated would succeed in achieving what metaphysics has vainly
attempted, namely a unified account of what really happens, wholly
true even if not the whole of truth, and free from all convenient
fictions or unwarrantable assumptions of metaphysical entities.
A causal law applicable to particulars would count as a law of
physics if it could be stated in terms of those fictitious systems
of regular appearances which are matter; if this were not the
case, it would count as a law of psychology if one of the particulars
were a sensation or an image, i.e. were subject to mnemic causation.
I believe that the realization of the complexity of a material
unit, and its analysis into constituents analogous to sensations,
is of the utmost importance to philosophy, and vital for any understanding
of the relations between mind and matter, between our perceptions
and the world which they perceive. It is in this direction, I
am convinced, that we must look for the solution of many ancient
perplexities.</p>

* In a perfected science, causal laws will take the form of<br/>
differential equations&mdash;or of finite-difference equations,<br/>
if the theory of quanta should prove correct.

</p>

<p>It is probable that the whole science of mental occurrences,
especially where its initial definitions are concerned, could
be simplified by the development of the fundamental unifying science
in which the causal laws of particulars are sought, rather than
the causal laws of those systems of particulars that constitute
the material units of physics. This fundamental science would
cause physics to become derivative, in the sort of way in which
theories of the constitution of the atom make chemistry derivative
from physics; it would also cause psychology to appear less singular
and isolated among sciences. If we are right in this, it is a
wrong philosophy of matter which has caused many of the difficulties
in the philosophy of mind&mdash;difficulties which a right philosophy
of matter would cause to disappear.</p>

<p>The conclusions at which we have arrived may be summed up as
follows:</p>

<p>I. Physics and psychology are not distinguished by their material.
Mind and matter alike are logical constructions; the particulars
out of which they are constructed, or from which they are inferred,
have various relations, some of which are studied by physics,
others by psychology. Broadly speaking, physics group particulars
by their active places, psychology by their passive places.</p>

<p><em>II. </em>The two most essential characteristics of the causal
laws which would naturally be called psychological are <em>SUBJECTIVITY
</em>and <em>MNEMIC CAUSATION; </em>these are not unconnected,
since the causal unit in mnemic causation is the group of particulars
having a given passive place at a given time, and it is by this
manner of grouping that subjectivity is defined.</p>

<p><em>III. </em>Habit, memory and thought are all developments
of mnemic causation. It is probable, though not certain, that
mnemic causation is derivative from ordinary physical causation
in nervous (and other) tissue.</p>

<p><em>IV. </em>Consciousness is a complex and far from universal
characteristic of mental phenomena.</p>

<p>V. Mind is a matter of degree, chiefly exemplified in number
and complexity of habits.</p>

<p><em>VI. </em>All our data, both in physics and psychology, are
subject to psychological causal laws; but physical causal laws,
at least in traditional physics, can only be stated in terms of
matter, which is both inferred and constructed, never a datum.
In this respect psychology is nearer to what actually exists.</p>
