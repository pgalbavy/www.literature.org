<p>WHEN Archie and Ottenburg dined with Thea on Saturday evening, they were
served downstairs in the hotel dining-room, but they were to have their
coffee in her own apartment. As they were going up in the elevator after
dinner, Fred turned suddenly to Thea. “And why, please, did you break
Landry's amber elephant?”
</p><p>She looked guilty and began to laugh. “Hasn't he got over that yet? I
didn't really mean to break it. I was perhaps careless. His things are
so over-petted that I was tempted to be careless with a lot of them.”
</p><p>“How can you be so heartless, when they're all he has in the world?”
</p><p>“He has me. I'm a great deal of diversion for him; all he needs. There,”
 she said as she opened the door into her own hall, “I shouldn't have
said that before the elevator boy.”
</p><p>“Even an elevator boy couldn't make a scandal about Oliver. He's such a
catnip man.”
</p><p>Dr. Archie laughed, but Thea, who seemed suddenly to have thought of
something annoying, repeated blankly, “Catnip man?”
</p><p>“Yes, he lives on catnip, and rum tea. But he's not the only one. You
are like an eccentric old woman I know in Boston, who goes about in the
spring feeding catnip to street cats. You dispense it to a lot of
fellows. Your pull seems to be more with men than with women, you know;
with seasoned men, about my age, or older. Even on Friday afternoon I
kept running into them, old boys I hadn't seen for years, thin at the
part and thick at the girth, until I stood still in the draft and held
my hair on. They're always there; I hear them talking about you in the
smoking room. Probably we don't get to the point of apprehending
anything good until we're about forty. Then, in the light of what is
going, and of what, God help us! is coming, we arrive at understanding.”
</p><p>“I don't see why people go to the opera, anyway,--serious people.” She
spoke discontentedly. “I suppose they get something, or think they do.
Here's the coffee. There, please,” she directed the waiter. Going to the
table she began to pour the coffee, standing. She wore a white dress
trimmed with crystals which had rattled a good deal during dinner, as
all her movements had been impatient and nervous, and she had twisted
the dark velvet rose at her girdle until it looked rumpled and weary.
She poured the coffee as if it were a ceremony in which she did not
believe. “Can you make anything of Fred's nonsense, Dr. Archie?” she
asked, as he came to take his cup.
</p><p>Fred approached her. “My nonsense is all right. The same brand has gone
with you before. It's you who won't be jollied. What's the matter? You
have something on your mind.”
</p><p>“I've a good deal. Too much to be an agreeable hostess.” She turned
quickly away from the coffee and sat down on the piano bench, facing the
two men. “For one thing, there's a change in the cast for Friday
afternoon. They're going to let me sing SIEGLINDE.” Her frown did not
conceal the pleasure with which she made this announcement.
</p><p>“Are you going to keep us dangling about here forever, Thea? Archie and
I are supposed to have other things to do.” Fred looked at her with an
excitement quite as apparent as her own.
</p><p>“Here I've been ready to sing SIEGLINDE for two years, kept in torment,
and now it comes off within two weeks, just when I want to be seeing
something of Dr. Archie. I don't know what their plans are down there.
After Friday they may let me cool for several weeks, and they may rush
me. I suppose it depends somewhat on how things go Friday afternoon.”
</p><p>“Oh, they'll go fast enough! That's better suited to your voice than
anything you've sung here. That gives you every opportunity I've waited
for.” Ottenburg crossed the room and standing beside her began to play
<strong>“DU BIST DER LENZ.”</strong>
</p><p>With a violent movement Thea caught his wrists and pushed his hands away
from the keys.
</p><p>“Fred, can't you be serious? A thousand things may happen between this
and Friday to put me out. Something will happen. If that part were sung
well, as well as it ought to be, it would be one of the most beautiful
things in the world. That's why it never is sung right, and never will
be.” She clenched her hands and opened them despairingly, looking out of
the open window. “It's inaccessibly beautiful!” she brought out sharply.
</p><p>Fred and Dr. Archie watched her. In a moment she turned back to them.
“It's impossible to sing a part like that well for the first time,
except for the sort who will never sing it any better. Everything hangs
on that first night, and that's bound to be bad. There you are,” she
shrugged impatiently. “For one thing, they change the cast at the
eleventh hour and then rehearse the life out of me.”
</p><p>Ottenburg put down his cup with exaggerated care. “Still, you really
want to do it, you know.”
</p><p>“Want to?” she repeated indignantly; “of course I want to! If this were
only next Thursday night--But between now and Friday I'll do nothing but
fret away my strength. Oh, I'm not saying I don't need the rehearsals!
But I don't need them strung out through a week. That system's well
enough for phlegmatic singers; it only drains me. Every single feature
of operatic routine is detrimental to me. I usually go on like a horse
that's been fixed to lose a race. I have to work hard to do my worst,
let alone my best. I wish you could hear me sing well, once,” she turned
to Fred defiantly; “I have, a few times in my life, when there was
nothing to gain by it.”
</p><p>Fred approached her again and held out his hand. “I recall my
instructions, and now I'll leave you to fight it out with Archie. He
can't possibly represent managerial stupidity to you as I seem to have a
gift for doing.”
</p><p>As he smiled down at her, his good humor, his good wishes, his
understanding, embarrassed her and recalled her to herself. She kept her
seat, still holding his hand. “All the same, Fred, isn't it too bad,
that there are so many things--” She broke off with a shake of the head.
</p><p>“My dear girl, if I could bridge over the agony between now and Friday
for you--But you know the rules of the game; why torment yourself? You
saw the other night that you had the part under your thumb. Now walk,
sleep, play with Archie, keep your tiger hungry, and she'll spring all
right on Friday. I'll be there to see her, and there'll be more than I,
I suspect. Harsanyi's on the Wilhelm der Grosse; gets in on Thursday.”
</p><p>“Harsanyi?” Thea's eye lighted. “I haven't seen him for years. We always
miss each other.” She paused, hesitating. “Yes, I should like that. But
he'll be busy, maybe?”
</p><p>“He gives his first concert at Carnegie Hall, week after next. Better
send him a box if you can.”
</p><p>“Yes, I'll manage it.” Thea took his hand again. “Oh, I should like
that, Fred!” she added impulsively. “Even if I were put out, he'd get
the idea,”--she threw back her head,--“for there is an idea!”
</p><p>“Which won't penetrate here,” he tapped his brow and began to laugh.
“You are an ungrateful huzzy, COMME LES AUTRES!”
</p><p>Thea detained him as he turned away. She pulled a flower out of a
bouquet on the piano and absently drew the stem through the lapel of his
coat. “I shall be walking in the Park to-morrow afternoon, on the
reservoir path, between four and five, if you care to join me. You know
that after Harsanyi I'd rather please you than anyone else. You know a
lot, but he knows even more than you.”
</p><p>“Thank you. Don't try to analyze it. SCHLAFEN SIE WOHL!” he kissed her
fingers and waved from the door, closing it behind him.
</p><p>“He's the right sort, Thea.” Dr. Archie looked warmly after his
disappearing friend. “I've always hoped you'd make it up with Fred.”
</p><p>“Well, haven't I? Oh, marry him, you mean! Perhaps it may come about,
some day. Just at present he's not in the marriage market any more than
I am, is he?”
</p><p>“No, I suppose not. It's a damned shame that a man like Ottenburg should
be tied up as he is, wasting all the best years of his life. A woman
with general paresis ought to be legally dead.”
</p><p>“Don't let us talk about Fred's wife, please. He had no business to get
into such a mess, and he had no business to stay in it. He's always been
a softy where women were concerned.”
</p><p>“Most of us are, I'm afraid,” Dr. Archie admitted meekly.
</p><p>“Too much light in here, isn't there? Tires one's eyes. The stage lights
are hard on mine.” Thea began turning them out. “We'll leave the little
one, over the piano.” She sank down by Archie on the deep sofa. “We two
have so much to talk about that we keep away from it altogether; have
you noticed? We don't even nibble the edges. I wish we had Landry here
to-night to play for us. He's very comforting.”
</p><p>“I'm afraid you don't have enough personal life, outside your work,
Thea.” The doctor looked at her anxiously.
</p><p>She smiled at him with her eyes half closed. “My dear doctor, I don't
have any. Your work becomes your personal life. You are not much good
until it does. It's like being woven into a big web. You can't pull
away, because all your little tendrils are woven into the picture. It
takes you up, and uses you, and spins you out; and that is your life.
Not much else can happen to you.”
</p><p>“Didn't you think of marrying, several years ago?”
</p><p>“You mean Nordquist? Yes; but I changed my mind. We had been singing a
good deal together. He's a splendid creature.”
</p><p>“Were you much in love with him, Thea?” the doctor asked hopefully.
</p><p>She smiled again. “I don't think I know just what that expression means.
I've never been able to find out. I think I was in love with you when I
was little, but not with any one since then. There are a great many ways
of caring for people. It's not, after all, a simple state, like measles
or tonsilitis. Nordquist is a taking sort of man. He and I were out in a
rowboat once in a terrible storm. The lake was fed by glaciers,--ice
water,--and we couldn't have swum a stroke if the boat had filled. If we
hadn't both been strong and kept our heads, we'd have gone down. We
pulled for every ounce there was in us, and we just got off with our
lives. We were always being thrown together like that, under some kind
of pressure. Yes, for a while I thought he would make everything right.”
 She paused and sank back, resting her head on a cushion, pressing her
eyelids down with her fingers. “You see,” she went on abruptly, “he had
a wife and two children. He hadn't lived with her for several years, but
when she heard that he wanted to marry again, she began to make trouble.
He earned a good deal of money, but he was careless and always
wretchedly in debt. He came to me one day and told me he thought his
wife would settle for a hundred thousand marks and consent to a divorce.
I got very angry and sent him away. Next day he came back and said he
thought she'd take fifty thousand.”
</p><p>Dr. Archie drew away from her, to the end of the sofa.
</p><p>“Good God, Thea,”--He ran his handkerchief over his forehead. “What sort
of people--” He stopped and shook his head.
</p><p>Thea rose and stood beside him, her hand on his shoulder. “That's
exactly how it struck me,” she said quietly. “Oh, we have things in
common, things that go away back, under everything. You understand, of
course. Nordquist didn't. He thought I wasn't willing to part with the
money. I couldn't let myself buy him from Fru Nordquist, and he couldn't
see why. He had always thought I was close about money, so he attributed
it to that. I am careful,”--she ran her arm through Archie's and when he
rose began to walk about the room with him. “I can't be careless with
money. I began the world on six hundred dollars, and it was the price of
a man's life. Ray Kennedy had worked hard and been sober and denied
himself, and when he died he had six hundred dollars to show for it. I
always measure things by that six hundred dollars, just as I measure
high buildings by the Moonstone standpipe. There are standards we can't
get away from.”
</p><p>Dr. Archie took her hand. “I don't believe we should be any happier if
we did get away from them. I think it gives you some of your poise,
having that anchor. You look,” glancing down at her head and shoulders,
“sometimes so like your mother.”
</p><p>“Thank you. You couldn't say anything nicer to me than that. On Friday
afternoon, didn't you think?”
</p><p>“Yes, but at other times, too. I love to see it. Do you know what I
thought about that first night when I heard you sing? I kept remembering
the night I took care of you when you had pneumonia, when you were ten
years old. You were a terribly sick child, and I was a country doctor
without much experience. There were no oxygen tanks about then. You
pretty nearly slipped away from me. If you had--”
</p><p>Thea dropped her head on his shoulder. “I'd have saved myself and you a
lot of trouble, wouldn't I? Dear Dr. Archie!” she murmured.
</p><p>“As for me, life would have been a pretty bleak stretch, with you left
out.” The doctor took one of the crystal pendants that hung from her
shoulder and looked into it thoughtfully. “I guess I'm a romantic old
fellow, underneath. And you've always been my romance. Those years when
you were growing up were my happiest. When I dream about you, I always
see you as a little girl.”
</p><p>They paused by the open window. “Do you? Nearly all my dreams, except
those about breaking down on the stage or missing trains, are about
Moonstone. You tell me the old house has been pulled down, but it stands
in my mind, every stick and timber. In my sleep I go all about it, and
look in the right drawers and cupboards for everything. I often dream
that I'm hunting for my rubbers in that pile of overshoes that was
always under the hatrack in the hall. I pick up every overshoe and know
whose it is, but I can't find my own. Then the school bell begins to
ring and I begin to cry. That's the house I rest in when I'm tired. All
the old furniture and the worn spots in the carpet--it rests my mind to
go over them.”
</p><p>They were looking out of the window. Thea kept his arm. Down on the
river four battleships were anchored in line, brilliantly lighted, and
launches were coming and going, bringing the men ashore. A searchlight
from one of the ironclads was playing on the great headland up the
river, where it makes its first resolute turn. Overhead the night-blue
sky was intense and clear.
</p><p>“There's so much that I want to tell you,” she said at last, “and it's
hard to explain. My life is full of jealousies and disappointments, you
know. You get to hating people who do contemptible work and who get on
just as well as you do. There are many disappointments in my profession,
and bitter, bitter contempts!” Her face hardened, and looked much older.
“If you love the good thing vitally, enough to give up for it all that
one must give up for it, then you must hate the cheap thing just as
hard. I tell you, there is such a thing as creative hate! A contempt
that drives you through fire, makes you risk everything and lose
everything, makes you a long sight better than you ever knew you could
be.” As she glanced at Dr. Archie's face, Thea stopped short and turned
her own face away. Her eyes followed the path of the searchlight up the
river and rested upon the illumined headland.
</p><p>“You see,” she went on more calmly, “voices are accidental things. You
find plenty of good voices in common women, with common minds and common
hearts. Look at that woman who sang ORTRUDE with me last week. She's new
here and the people are wild about her. 'Such a beautiful volume of
tone!' they say. I give you my word she's as stupid as an owl and as
coarse as a pig, and any one who knows anything about singing would see
that in an instant. Yet she's quite as popular as Necker, who's a great
artist. How can I get much satisfaction out of the enthusiasm of a house
that likes her atrociously bad performance at the same time that it
pretends to like mine? If they like her, then they ought to hiss me off
the stage. We stand for things that are irreconcilable, absolutely. You
can't try to do things right and not despise the people who do them
wrong. How can I be indifferent? If that doesn't matter, then nothing
matters. Well, sometimes I've come home as I did the other night when
you first saw me, so full of bitterness that it was as if my mind were
full of daggers. And I've gone to sleep and wakened up in the Kohlers'
garden, with the pigeons and the white rabbits, so happy! And that saves
me.” She sat down on the piano bench. Archie thought she had forgotten
all about him, until she called his name. Her voice was soft now, and
wonderfully sweet. It seemed to come from somewhere deep within her,
there were such strong vibrations in it. “You see, Dr. Archie, what one
really strives for in art is not the sort of thing you are likely to
find when you drop in for a performance at the opera. What one strives
for is so far away, so deep, so beautiful”--she lifted her shoulders
with a long breath, folded her hands in her lap and sat looking at him
with a resignation that made her face noble,--“that there's nothing one
can say about it, Dr. Archie.”
</p><p>Without knowing very well what it was all about, Archie was passionately
stirred for her. “I've always believed in you, Thea; always believed,”
 he muttered.
</p><p>She smiled and closed her eyes. “They save me: the old things, things
like the Kohlers' garden. They are in everything I do.”
</p><p>“In what you sing, you mean?”
</p><p>“Yes. Not in any direct way,”--she spoke hurriedly,--“the light, the
color, the feeling. Most of all the feeling. It comes in when I'm
working on a part, like the smell of a garden coming in at the window. I
try all the new things, and then go back to the old. Perhaps my feelings
were stronger then. A child's attitude toward everything is an artist's
attitude. I am more or less of an artist now, but then I was nothing
else. When I went with you to Chicago that first time, I carried with me
the essentials, the foundation of all I do now. The point to which I
could go was scratched in me then. I haven't reached it yet, by a long
way.”
</p><p>Archie had a swift flash of memory. Pictures passed before him. “You
mean,” he asked wonderingly, “that you knew then that you were so
gifted?”
</p><p>Thea looked up at him and smiled. “Oh, I didn't know anything! Not
enough to ask you for my trunk when I needed it. But you see, when I set
out from Moonstone with you, I had had a rich, romantic past. I had
lived a long, eventful life, and an artist's life, every hour of it.
Wagner says, in his most beautiful opera, that art is only a way of
remembering youth. And the older we grow the more precious it seems to
us, and the more richly we can present that memory. When we've got it
all out,--the last, the finest thrill of it, the brightest hope of
it,”--she lifted her hand above her head and dropped it,--“then we stop.
We do nothing but repeat after that. The stream has reached the level of
its source. That's our measure.”
</p><p>There was a long, warm silence. Thea was looking hard at the floor, as
if she were seeing down through years and years, and her old friend
stood watching her bent head. His look was one with which he used to
watch her long ago, and which, even in thinking about her, had become a
habit of his face. It was full of solicitude, and a kind of secret
gratitude, as if to thank her for some inexpressible pleasure of the
heart. Thea turned presently toward the piano and began softly to waken
an old air:--
</p>
<pre>
     “Ca' the yowes to the knowes,
     Ca' them where the heather grows,
     Ca' them where the burnie rowes,
     My bonnie dear-ie.”</pre>

<p>Archie sat down and shaded his eyes with his hand. She turned her head
and spoke to him over her shoulder. “Come on, you know the words better
than I. That's right.”
</p>
<p>“We'll gae down by Clouden's side, Through the hazels spreading wide,
O'er the waves that sweetly glide, To the moon sae clearly. Ghaist nor
bogle shalt thou fear, Thou'rt to love and Heav'n sae dear, Nocht of ill
may come thee near, My bonnie dear-ie!”
</p>
<p>“We can get on without Landry. Let's try it again, I have all the words
now. Then we'll have 'Sweet Afton.' Come: 'CA' THE YOWES TO THE
<strong>KNOWES'--”</strong>
