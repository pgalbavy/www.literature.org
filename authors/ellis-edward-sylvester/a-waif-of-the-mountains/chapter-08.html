<p><em>THE </em>excitement in New Constantinople was caused by the
arrival of Vose Adams, the mail carrier and messenger, with his
budget of letters and freight for the Heavenly Bower.</p>

<p>These periodical journeys never occupied less than two weeks,
and in the present instance he had been absent several days beyond
that period, so that some anxiety was felt for him, since every
trip was attended with more or less danger. He was exposed to
the peril of storms, snowslides, wild animals and hostile Indians.
The elemental disturbances in the Sierras are sometimes of a terrific
nature. Twice he had lost a mule, and once both animals went spinning
down a precipice for a thousand feet, in an avalanche of snow
and were never found again. Vose's only consolation in the last
instance was that it occurred when on his way to Sacramento, while
in the former case he saved one of the precious kegs, which he
insisted was the means of saving him in turn from perishing in
the Arctic temperature.</p>

<p>The shadowy trail wound in and out among the gorges and ca√±ons,
beside towering mountain walls, at a dizzying elevation, over
ridges above the snow line, across table lands, through forests
of pine and cedar and tumultuous mountain torrents, where he took
his life in his hands every time he made the venture.</p>

<p>The unerring marksmanship of Vose and his alertness reduced the
danger from the fierce grizzly bears and ravening mountain wolves
to the minimum, but the red men were an ever present peril. He
had served as the target of many a whizzing arrow and stealthy
rifle shot, but thus far had emerged with only a few insignificant
hurts. He was ready at the stated times to set out on his journey,
and appeared indeed to welcome the change in the existence which
otherwise became tiresome and monotonous. It mattered not that
his friends often intimated that he was starting on his last venture
of that nature, for he believed that his "time" had been set and
it mattered naught what he did, since it could not be changed.</p>

<p>Vose explained that the cause of his last delay was the old one
&mdash;Indians. They had pursued and pestered him so persistently
that he was compelled to hunt out a new trail, longer and more
difficult that the old one, and which came within a hair of landing
him into the very camp of his enemies. However, everything had
turned out well, and he brought with him the most prized cargo
that ever arrived in New Constantinople.</p>

<p>First of all, were the two casks of freight, which had suffered
so slight leakage, that Landlord Ortigies complimented the vigilance
of the messenger. Then he brought with him fully a hundred letters
and newspapers. Each citizen received one, and many had several.
In every instance, the grateful recipient paid Vose a dollar for
his mail, so that the reward was generous, including as it did
a liberal honorarium from the proprietor of the Heavenly Bower.</p>

<p>In addition to the mail and freight, there were a number of articles
to which no special reference is needed. In one package, however,
every one was deeply interested, and Nellie Dawson more than the
others. Unknown to the father, a goodly sum had been entrusted
to Adams, with which to purchase such articles as it was believed
the child needed. These included material for numerous new dresses
of gorgeous pattern, stockings, shoes, slippers, ribbons, hats
and even gloves, trinkets and playthings beyond enumeration.</p>

<p>When these were spread out before the little one, she clapped
her hands and danced with delight. She had never dreamed of or
seen such bewildering wealth, and the miners were repaid a hundred
fold, while the grateful parent thanked them for their thoughtful
kindness.</p>

<p>With no other person of her sex in the settlement, it would naturally
be thought that she lacked in many of the little attentions which
only a mother or adult female friend can give, but such was not
the case. There was not a man among them all, who had not been
taught in the hard school of necessity to become his own tailor
and conservator of clothing. Many had natural taste, and had not
wholly forgotten the education and training received in the homes
of civilization, before they became adventurers and wanderers.
A consensus of views, all moved by the same gentle impulse, resulted
in Nellie Dawson being clothed in a garb which would hardly have
caused criticism in the metropolis of our country. Not only that,
but she was abundantly provided against all kinds of weather,
and with Vose Adams making his regular trips westward, there was
no possibility of her ever knowing the want of thoughtful care.</p>

<p>The education of the little one was never neglected. Enough has
been told to show her brightness, and even had not her teacher
been inspired by his affection for the little one, the task of
imparting knowledge to such an apt pupil must have been a constant
pleasure. This work, as we have shown, fell by common consent
to the parson, Felix Brush, though his choice at first was not
unanimous. Wade Ruggles was so insistent that he should have a
part in the work, that he was allowed a trial, but it cannot be
said the result of several days' effort was satisfactory. A stealthy
inspection of the blackboard by Budge Isham and the parson disclosed
that Ruggles had constructed the alphabet on a system of his own.
Some of the letters were reversed, several inverted, while the
forms of others prevented any one from identifying them except
the teacher himself.</p>

<p>An examination of the pupil developed the same startling originality
in Ruggles's system of orthography, which seemed to be a mixture
of the phonetic and the prevailing awkward method. Thus he insisted
that "purp" was the right way to spell the name of a young dog,
whose correct title was "dorg." Ruggles was finally persuaded
to resign, though he displayed considerable ill feeling and intimated
that the movement was inspired by jealousy of his success.</p>

<p>Budge Isham not only refrained from referring to the slip which
the parson made in his spelling lesson, but spoke in such high
terms of his success with Nellie, that every one conceded the
right teacher had been selected, and it would be a misfortune
for any one to assume to take the place of the parson.</p>

<p>Not until the final summing up of all accounts, will the full
measure of the influence of the little one be known. It was gentle,
subtle, almost imperceptible. Wade Ruggles never broke his resolve
not to touch liquor. Inasmuch as an appetite nourished for years,
cannot be wholly extirpated in a day, he had his moments of intense
yearning for stimulants, when the temptation was powerful, but
his will was still more so, and the time came when the terrific
thirst vanished entirely, though he knew it was simply "asleep"
and could be roused into resistless fury by indulgence in a single
glass.</p>

<p>The parson had a severer struggle. After holding out for days,
he yielded, and by his inordinate dissipation brought back matters
to a fair average. Then he set about manfully to retrieve himself.
A second time he fell, and then, thank heaven! he gained the mastery.
Henceforward he was safe.</p>

<p>Maurice Dawson himself had been an occasional tippler for years,
but he felt the influence of example and experienced no trouble
in giving up the habit. Several others did the same, while more
tried but "fell by the wayside."</p>

<p>Landlord Ortigies noticed the diminution in his receipts, but,
strange as it may sound, down in his heart he was not sorry. Like
nine out of ten engaged in his business he was dissatisfied, and
like the same nine out of ten, he longed for the chance to take
up some other calling which would bring him bread and butter and
no accusing pangs of conscience.</p>

<p>Before the coming of Nellie Dawson, brawls and personal encounters
often occurred. The walls of the Heavenly Bower contained several
pounds of lead. Blood had been shed, and the history of the settlement
showed that three persons had died with their boots on, but those
stirring days seemed to have departed forever.</p>

<p>Parson Brush did a good deal of thinking. When through with his
pupil, he was accustomed to take long walks into the mountains,
his hands clasped behind his back and his head bowed in meditation.
It is safe to conclude that Conscience was getting in its work
with him.</p>

<p>And so the seasons came and went and the years rolled on. Varick
Thomson, an old miner, who had spent years of fruitless toil in
the diggings of Australia, lay down and died, and the parson officiated
at his funeral. Two other miners grew weary of the poor success
in Dead Man's Gulch and went off on a prospecting tour deeper
into the mountains. A year later another prospecting party came
upon two skeletons, near a small stream of water, which after
careful examination, were pronounced to be those of their former
friends, doubtless victims of the ferocity of the red men. Three
vagrant miners straggled into New Constantinople one night and
were hospitably entertained at the Heavenly Bower. Their appearance
was against them, and, when they announced their intention of
making their home at Dead Man's Gulch, the suggestion to them
to move on was made in such terms that they acted upon it and
were never seen there again. Thus it came about that New Constantinople,
instead of increasing in population and making a bid for the chieftaincy
among the new towns in the West, was actually shrinking in numbers.</p>

<p>And all this time, Nellie Dawson was growing fast. Her beautiful
mind kept pace with the expansion of her body. Her natural grace
and perfection of figure would have roused admiration anywhere.
Her innocence and goodness were an ever present benison to the
rough miners, who had long since learned to check the hasty word,
to restrain the rising temper and to crush the wrongful thought
in her presence.</p>

<p>After a time, Maurice Dawson took possession of one of the deserted
cabins which he fitted up, or rather the community fitted up the
principal apartment for the young queen, whose rule was supreme.
No one else was permitted to share the building with them, though
visitors were constant and Nellie herself continually passed to
and fro among her friends.</p>

<p>But those who watched Dawson saw that a change had come over
him. Formerly there was a quiet waggery in his nature, much like
that of Budge Isham, which led him to enjoy the rough pleasantries
of his companions, though he rarely took part in them, except
as an inciting cause. One of his greatest pleasures had been to
sit in the Heavenly Bower and exchange reminiscences with his
friends, but all that came to an end. Night after night passed
without his face being seen in the place. Those who called at
the cabin were treated hospitably, but he was reserved and moody,
and often failed to hear the words addressed to him. It was evident
that there was something on his mind, though he showed no disposition
to make a confidant of any one.</p>
