<p>John soon settled down into the routine of camp life in Pretoria, which,
after one became accustomed to it, was not so disagreeable as might
have been expected, and possessed, at any rate, the merit of novelty.
Although he was an officer of the army, having several horses to ride
and his services not being otherwise required, John preferred, on the
whole, to enrol himself in the corps of mounted volunteers, known as
the Pretoria Carbineers. This, in the humble capacity of a sergeant, he
obtained leave to do from the officer commanding the troops. He was an
active man, and his duties in connection with the corps kept him fully
employed during most of the day, and sometimes, when there was outpost
duty to be done, during a good part of the night too. For the rest,
whenever he returned to the cart--by which he had stipulated he should
be allowed to sleep in order to protect Jess in case of any danger--he
always found her ready to greet him, and every little preparation made
for his comfort that was possible under the circumstances. Indeed, as
time went on, they thought it more convenient to set up their own little
mess instead of sharing that of their friends. So every day they used to
sit down to breakfast and dine together at a little table contrived out
of a packing-case, and placed under an extemporised tent, for all the
world like a young couple picnicking on their honeymoon. Of course, the
situation was very irksome in a way, but it is not to be denied that it
had a charm of its own.
</p><p>To begin with, once thoroughly known, Jess was one of the most
delightful companions possible to a man like John Niel. Never, till this
long <u>tete-a-tete</u> at Pretoria, had he guessed how powerful and original
was her mind, or how witty she could be when she liked. There was a fund
of dry and suggestive humour about her, which, although it would no more
bear being written down than champagne will bear standing in a tumbler,
was very pleasant to listen to, more especially as John soon discovered
that he was the only person so privileged. Her friends and relations had
never suspected that Jess was humorous. Another thing which struck him
as time went on, was that she was growing quite handsome. She had been
very pale and thin when he reached Pretoria, but before a month was over
she had become, comparatively speaking, stout, which was an enormous
gain to her appearance. Her pale face, too, gathered a faint tinge of
colour that came and went capriciously, like star-light on the water,
and her beautiful eyes grew deeper and more beautiful than ever.
</p><p>“Who would ever have thought that it was the same girl!” said Mrs.
Neville to him, holding up her hands as she watched Jess solemnly
surveying a half-cooked mutton chop. “Why, she used to be such a poor
creature, and now she’s quite a fine woman. And that with this life,
too, which is wearing me to a shadow and has half-killed my dear
daughter.”
</p><p>“I suppose it is being in the open air,” said John, it having never
occurred to him that the medicine that was doing Jess so much good might
be happiness. But so it was. After her first struggles came a lull, and
then an idea. Why should she not enjoy his society while she could? He
had been thrown into her way through no wish of hers. She had no desire
to wean him from Bessie; or, if she had the desire, it was one which she
was far too honourable a woman to entertain. He was perfectly innocent
of the whole story; to him she was the young lady who happened to be the
sister of the woman he was going to marry, that was all. Why should she
not pluck her innocent roses whilst she might? Jess forgot that the rose
is a flower with a dangerous perfume, and one that is apt to confuse the
senses and turn the head. So she gave herself full swing, and for some
weeks went nearer to knowing what happiness really meant than she
ever had before. What a wonderful thing is the love of a woman in its
simplicity and strength, and how it gilds all the poor and common things
of life and even finds a joy in service! The prouder the woman the more
delight does she extract from her self-abasement before her idol. Only
not many women can love like Jess, and when they do almost invariably
they make some fatal mistake, whereby the wealth of their affection
is wasted, or, worse still, becomes a source of misery or shame to
themselves and others.
</p><p>It was after they had been incarcerated in Pretoria for a month that
a bright idea occurred to John. About a quarter of a mile from the
outskirts of the camp stood a little house known, probably on account of
its diminutive size, as “The Palatial.” This cottage, like almost every
other house in Pretoria, had been abandoned to its fate, its owner, as
it happened, being away from the town. One day, in the course of a walk,
John and Jess crossed the little bridge that spanned the <u>sluit</u> and
went in to inspect the place. Passing down a path lined on either side
with young blue gums, they reached the little tin-roofed cottage. It
consisted of two rooms--a bedroom and a good-sized sitting-room, in
which still stood a table and a few chairs, with a stable and a kitchen
at the back. They went in, sat down by the open door and looked out. The
garden of the cottage sloped down towards a valley, on the farther side
of which rose a wooded hill. To the right, too, was a hill clothed in
deep green bush. The grounds themselves were planted with vines,
just now loaded with bunches of ripening grapes, and surrounded by a
beautiful hedge of monthly roses that formed a blaze of bloom. Near the
house, too, was a bed of double roses, some of them exceedingly lovely,
and all flowering with a profusion unknown in this country. Altogether
it was a delightful spot, and, after the noise and glare of the camp,
seemed a perfect heaven. So they sat there and talked a great deal about
the farm and old Silas Croft and a little about Bessie.
</p><p>“This <u>is</u> nice,” said Jess presently, putting her hands behind her head
and looking out at the bush beyond.
</p><p>“Yes,” said John. “I say, I’ve got a notion. I vote we take up our
quarters here--during the day, I mean. Of course we shall have to sleep
in camp, but we might eat here, you know, and you could sit here all
day; it would be as safe as a church, for those Boers will never try to
storm the town, I am sure of that.”
</p><p>Jess reflected, and soon came to the conclusion that it would be a
charming plan. Accordingly, next day she set to work and made the place
as clean and tidy as circumstances would allow, and they commenced
house-keeping.
</p><p>The upshot of this arrangement was that they were thrown more together
even than before. Meanwhile the siege dragged its slow length along. No
news whatever reached the town from outside, but this did not trouble
the inhabitants very much, as they were sure that Colley was advancing
to their relief, and even got up sweep-stakes as to the date of his
arrival. Now and then a sortie took place, but, as the results attained
were very small, and were not, on the whole, creditable to our arms,
perhaps the less said about them the better. John, of course, went out
on these occasions, and then Jess would endure agonies that were all
the worse because she was forced to conceal them. She lived in constant
terror lest he should be among the killed. However, nothing happened to
him, and things went on as usual till the twelfth of February, when
an attack was made on a place called the Red House Kraal, which was
occupied by Boers near a spot known as the Six-mile Spruit.
</p><p>The force, which was a mixed one, left Pretoria before daybreak, and
John went with it. He was rather surprised when, on going to the cart in
which Jess slept, to get some little thing before saddling up, he found
her sitting on the box in the night dews, a cup of hot coffee which she
had prepared for him in her hand.
</p><p>“What do you mean by this, Jess?” he asked sharply. “I will not have you
getting up in the middle of the night to make coffee for me.”
</p><p>“I have not got up,” she answered quietly; “I have not been to bed.”
</p><p>“That makes matters worse,” he exclaimed; but, nevertheless, he drank
the coffee and was glad of it, while she sat on the box and watched him.
</p><p>“Put on your shawl and wrap something over your head,” he said, “the dew
will soak you through. Look, your hair is all wet.”
</p><p>Presently she spoke. “I wish you would do something for me, John,” for
she called him John now. “Will you promise?”
</p><p>“How like a woman,” he said, “to ask one to promise a thing without
saying what it is.”
</p><p>“I want you to promise for Bessie’s sake, John.”
</p><p>“Well, what is it, Jess?”
</p><p>“Not to go on this sortie. You know you can easily get out of it if you
like.”
</p><p>He laughed. “You little silly, why not?”
</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know. Don’t laugh at me because I am nervous. I am afraid
that--that something might happen to you.”
</p><p>“Well,” he remarked consolingly, “every bullet has its billet, and if it
does I don’t see that it can be helped.”
</p><p>“Think of Bessie,” she said again.
</p><p>“Look here, Jess,” he answered testily, “what is the good of trying to
take the heart out of a fellow like this? If I am going to be shot I
can’t help it, and I am not going to show the white feather, even for
Bessie’s sake; so there you are, and now I must be off.”
</p><p>“You are quite right, John,” she said quietly. “I should not have liked
to hear you say anything different, but I could not help speaking.
Good-bye, John; God bless you!” and she stretched out her hand, which he
took, and went.
</p><p>“Upon my word, she has given me quite a turn,” reflected John to
himself, as the troop crept on through the white mists of dawn. “I
suppose she thinks that I am going to be plugged. Perhaps I am! I wonder
how Bessie would take it. She would be awfully cut up, but I expect that
she would get over it pretty soon. Now I don’t think that Jess would
shake off a thing of that sort in a hurry. That is just the difference
between the two; the one is all flower and the other is all root.”
</p><p>Then he fell to wondering how Bessie was, and what she was doing, and if
she missed him as much as he missed her, and so on, till his mind came
back to Jess, and he reflected what a charming companion she was, and
how thoughtful and kind, and breathed a secret hope that she would
continue to live with them after they were married. Unconsciously they
had arrived at that point of intimacy, innocent in itself, when two
people become absolutely necessary to each other’s daily life. Indeed,
Jess had travelled a long way farther, but of this John was of course
ignorant. He was still at the former stage, and was not himself aware
how large a proportion of his daily thoughts were occupied by this
dark-eyed girl or how completely her personality overshadowed him. He
only knew that she had the knack of making him feel thoroughly happy
in her company. When he was talking to her, or even sitting silently by
her, he became aware of a sensation of restfulness and reliance that he
had never before experienced in the society of a woman. Of course to
a large extent this was the natural homage of the weaker nature to the
stronger, but it was also something more. It was a shadow of the utter
sympathy and complete accord that is the surest sign of the presence of
the highest forms of affection, which, when it accompanies the passion
of men and women, as it sometimes though rarely does, being more often
to be found in perfection in those relations from which the element of
sexuality is excluded, raises it almost above the level of the earth.
For the love where that sympathy exists, whether it is between mother
and son, husband and wife, or those who, whilst desiring it, have no
hope of that relationship, is an undying love, and will endure till the
night of Time has swallowed all things.
</p><p>Meanwhile, as John reflected, the force to which he was attached was
moving into action, and soon he found it necessary to come down to the
unpleasantly practical details of Boer warfare. More particularly did
this come home to his mind when, shortly afterwards, the man next to him
was shot dead, and a little later he himself was slightly wounded by a
bullet which passed between the saddle and his thigh. Into the details
of the fight that ensued it is not necessary to enter here. They were,
if anything, more discreditable than most of the episodes of that
unhappy war in which the holding of Potchefstroom, Lydenburg,
Rustenburg, and Wakkerstroom are the only bright spots. Suffice it to
say that they ended in something very like an utter rout of the English
at the hands of a much inferior force, and that, a few hours after he
had started, the ambulance being left in the hands of the Boers, John
found himself on the return road to Pretoria, with a severely wounded
man behind his saddle, who, as they went painfully along, mingled curses
of shame and fury with his own. Meanwhile exaggerated accounts of the
English defeat had reached the town, and, amongst other things, it was
said that Captain Niel had been shot dead. One man who came in stated
that he saw him fall, and that he was shot through the head. This
Mrs. Neville heard with her own ears, and, greatly shocked, started to
communicate the intelligence to Jess.
</p><p>As soon as it was daylight, as was customary with her, Jess had gone
over to the little house which she and John occupied, “The Palatial,” as
it was called ironically, and settled herself there for the day. First
she tried to work and could not, so she took a book that she had brought
with her and began to read, but it was a failure also. Her eyes would
wander from the page and her ears strain to catch the distant booming of
the big guns that came from time to time floating across the hills.
The fact of the matter was that the poor girl was the victim of a
presentiment that something was going to happen to John. Most people of
imaginative mind have suffered from this kind of thing at one time or
other in their lives, and have lived to see the folly of it; and there
was more in the circumstances of the present case to excuse indulgence
in the luxury of presentiments than as usual. Indeed, as it happened,
she was not far out--only a sixteenth of an inch or so--for John was
very <u>nearly</u> killed.
</p><p>Not finding Jess in camp, Mrs. Neville made her way across to “The
Palatial,” where she knew the girl sat, crying as she went, at the
thought of the news that she had to communicate, for the good soul had
grown very fond of John Niel. Jess, with that acute sense of hearing
which often accompanies nervous excitement, caught the sound of the
little gate at the bottom of the garden almost before her visitor had
passed through it, and ran round the corner of the house to see who was
there.
</p><p>One glance at Mrs. Neville’s tear-stained face was enough for her. She
knew what was coming, and clasped at one of the young blue gum trees
that grew along the path to prevent herself from falling.
</p><p>“What is it?” she said faintly. “Is he dead?”
</p><p>“Yes, my dear, yes; shot through the head, they say.”
</p><p>Jess made no answer, but clung to the sapling, feeling as though she
were going to die herself, and faintly hoping that she might do so. Her
eyes wandered vaguely from the face of the messenger of evil, first up
to the sky, then down to the cropped and trodden veldt. Past the gate of
“The Palatial” garden ran a road, which, as it happened, was a short
cut from the scene of the fight, and down this road came four Kafirs and
half-castes, bearing something on a stretcher, behind which rode three
or four carbineers. A coat was thrown over the face of the form on the
stretcher, but its legs were visible. They were booted and spurred, and
the feet fell apart in that peculiarly lax and helpless way of which
there is no possibility of mistaking the meaning.
</p><p>“_Look!_” she said, pointing.
</p><p>“Ah, poor man, poor man!” said Mrs. Neville, “they are bringing him here
to lay him out.”
</p><p>Then Jess’s beautiful eyes closed, and down she went with the bending
tree. Presently the sapling snapped, and she fell senseless with a
little cry, and as she fell the men with the corpse passed on.
</p><p>Two minutes afterwards, John Niel, having heard the rumour of his own
death on arrival at the camp, and greatly fearing lest it should have
reached Jess’s ears, cantered up hurriedly, and, dismounting as well as
his wound would allow, limped up the garden path.
</p><p>“Great heavens, Captain Niel!” exclaimed Mrs. Neville, looking up;
“why--we thought that you were dead!”
</p><p>“And that is what you have been telling her, I suppose,” he said
sternly, glancing at the pale and deathlike face; “you might have waited
till you were sure. Poor girl! it must have given her a turn!” and,
stooping down, he placed his arms under Jess, and, lifting her with
some difficulty, staggered to the house, where he laid her down upon
the table and, assisted by Mrs. Neville, began to do all in his power to
revive her. So obstinate was her faint, however, that their efforts were
unavailing, and at last Mrs. Neville started for the camp to get some
brandy, leaving him to go on rubbing her hands and sprinkling water on
her face.
</p><p>The good lady had not been gone more than two or three minutes when Jess
suddenly opened her eyes and sat up, slipping her feet to the ground.
Her eyes fell upon John and dilated with wonder; he thought that she was
about to faint again, for even her lips blanched, and she began to shake
and tremble all over in the extremity of her agitation.
</p><p>“Jess, Jess,” he said, “for God’s sake don’t look like that, you
frighten me!”
</p><p>“I thought you were--I thought you were----” she said slowly, then
suddenly burst into a passion of tears and fell forward upon his breast
and lay there sobbing her heart out, her brown curls resting against his
face.
</p><p>It was an awkward and a most moving position. John was only a man, and
the spectacle of this strange woman, to whom he had lately grown so much
attached, plunged into intense emotion, awakened, apparently, by anxiety
about his fate, stirred him very deeply--as it would have stirred
anybody. Indeed, it struck some chord in him for which he could not
quite account, and its echoes charmed and yet frightened him. What did
it mean?
</p><p>“Jess, dear Jess, pray stop; I can’t bear to see you cry so,” he said at
last.
</p><p>She lifted her head from his shoulder and stood looking at him, her hand
resting on the edge of the table behind her. Her face was wet with tears
and looked like a dew-washed lily, and her beautiful eyes were alight
with a flame that he had never seen in the eyes of woman before. She
said nothing, but her whole face was more eloquent than any words, for
there are times when the features can convey a message in that language
of their own which is more suitable than any tongue we talk. There
she stood, her breast heaving with emotion as the sea heaves when the
fierceness of the storm has passed--a very incarnation of the intensest
love of woman. And as she stood something seemed to pass before her eyes
and blind her; a spirit took possession of her that absorbed all her
doubts and fears, and she gave way to a force that was of her and yet
compelled her, as, when the wind blows, the sails compel a ship. Then,
for the first time, where her love was concerned, she put out all her
strength. She knew, and had always known, that she could master him, and
force him to regard her as she regarded him, did she but choose. How
she knew it she could not say, but it was so. Now she yielded to an
unconquerable impulse and chose. She said nothing, she did not even
move, she only looked at him.
</p><p>“Why were you in such a fright about me?” he stammered.
</p><p>She did not answer, but kept her eyes upon his face, and it seemed to
John as though power flowed from them; for, while she looked, he felt
the change come. Everything melted away before the almost spiritual
intensity of her gaze. Bessie, honour, his engagement--all were
forgotten; the smouldering embers broke into flame, and he knew that he
loved this woman as he had never loved any living creature before--that
he loved her even as she loved him. Strong man as he was, he shook like
a leaf before her.
</p><p>“Jess,” he said hoarsely, “God forgive me! I love you!” and he bent
forward to kiss her.
</p><p>She lifted her face towards him, then suddenly changed her mind, and
laid her hand upon his breast.
</p><p>“You forget,” she said almost solemnly, “you are going to marry Bessie.”
</p><p>Crushed by a deep sense of shame, and by a knowledge of the calamity
that had overtaken him, John turned and limped from the house.
