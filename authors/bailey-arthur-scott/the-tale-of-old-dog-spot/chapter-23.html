<p>Old dog Spot was bewildered. When he crawled under the canvas he had not
dreamed that he was entering the main tent of the circus. He saw so many
strange sights that he didn't know whether to bark or to crawl away and
hide somewhere. Yet among all those people he felt lonely. He couldn't
see anybody he knew.
</p>
<p>All at once the bandsmen began to play louder than ever. They seemed to
be trying to burst their horns--or themselves. And men in flowing robes,
each one standing in a sort of little two-wheeled cart and driving four
horses abreast, came tearing past the place where Spot was standing.
</p><p>It was a race! And if there was one thing that Spot liked more than
another it was a race of any kind. He gave a few delighted barks and ran
after the galloping horses.
</p><p>Spot followed them twice around the big tent. And just as he fell into a
jog--for the race was finished--he heard a whistle that gave him a great
thrill. He stood still for an instant. Then he dashed toward the nearest
seats.
</p><p>A moment later he was fawning upon Johnnie Green, who sat in the lowest
row and seemed as glad to see Spot as Spot was to see him.
</p><p>Lying between Johnnie's feet, Spot watched the rest of the show.
</p><p>At last the circus was over. The Green family, with Spot at their heels,
went back to the place where they had left the bays and the carryall.
And in a few minutes more they were on their way back to Pleasant Valley
and home.
</p><p>That morning everybody on the road had seemed to be in a great hurry to
get to the village. And now, late in the afternoon, everybody was in
just as great a hurry to get away from it. Farmer Green kept the bays at
a spanking trot, only pausing to let them breathe now and then on the
hills.
</p><p>Spot, however, was not in such haste that he didn't stop and give a good
trouncing to the dog that had rushed out at him earlier in the day. Spot
sent the surly fellow yelping into his master's yard. Then he rushed
down the road to overtake the carryall.
</p><p>But, to everybody's surprise, when they reached home old dog Spot was
missing.
</p><p>"He'll come back," Farmer Green said. "Probably he's stopped somewhere
to chase a rabbit or something. He'll be along after a while."
</p><p>But after the cows were milked old Spot was still absent. And after the
family had eaten supper he had failed to appear. Bedtime came. Still no
Spot!
</p><p>Johnnie Green felt very sad when he went upstairs.
</p><p>He felt even worse when morning came. He had hoped that Spot would be in
the yard, begging for his breakfast.
</p><p>Johnnie Green was able to eat only a little of his own breakfast. And as
soon as he left the table he went to the barn and harnessed his pony,
Twinkleheels, to the little buggy with the red wheels.
</p><p>Then Johnnie started for the village.
