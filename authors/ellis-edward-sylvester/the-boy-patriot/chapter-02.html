<p>The boys of Fairport were an amphibious set, who could live on
land truly, but were happiest when in or near the water. To fish
and swim, row, trim the sail, and guide the rudder, were accomplishments
they all could boast. A bold, hardy, merry set they were; and
but for the schoolmaster's rod and the teaching of their pious
mothers, might have been as ignorant as oysters and merciless
as the sharks. Master Penrose had whipped into most of them the
elements of a plain English education, and gentle mothers had
power to soften and rule these rough boys, when perhaps a stronger
hand would have failed.</p>

<p>Master Penrose always gave a full holiday on Saturday. Then the
wharves were sure to swarm with the mischievous little chaps,
all eager to carry out some favorite plan for amusement, in which
old Ocean was sure to be engaged as a play-fellow. Poor indeed
was the lad who had not a fish-hook and line with which to try
his skill. The very youngest had his tiny boat to be launched,
while his elders were planning sailing-parties, or jumping and
leaping in the water like so many dolphins.</p>

<p>Boys like to have a leader, some one they look up to as superior
to the rest, and capable of deciding knotty questions, and "going
ahead" in all times of doubt and difficulty. Blair Robertson occupied
this position among the youngsters of Fairport. He had lawfully
won this place among his fellows and "achieved greatness," by
being the best scholar at the academy, as well as the boldest
swimmer, most skilful fisherman, and most experienced sailor among
all the boys for miles along the coast. It was Blair Robertson's
boast that he belonged to the nineteenth century, and grew old
with it. It was doubtful whether the bold lad considered this
age of progress as honored by his playing his part in its drama,
or whether he claimed a reflected glory, as having been born at
the very dawn of that century which promised so much for the thronging
millions of our world.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Joe Robertson the pilot and Margaret his wife
rejoiced, in the year 1800, over their first and only child. Thirteen
years had swept by, and the honest couple were now as proud of
that brave, strong boy as they had been of their baby, and with
better reason.</p>

<p>Troublous times had come upon their native land. War had been
declared with England. All Fairport was ablaze at the idea of
American seamen being forced to serve on English ships, and of
decks whose timber grew in the free forests of Maine or North
Carolina, being trodden by the unscrupulous feet of British officers
with insolent search-warrants in their hands.</p>

<p>Blair Robertson had his own views on these subjects&mdash;views which
we find him giving forth to his devoted followers one sunny Saturday
afternoon.</p>

<p>Blair was mounted on a sugar hogshead which stood in front of
one of the warehouses on the wharf. From this place of eminence
he looked down on a constantly increasing crowd of youthful listeners.
A half hour before, a row of little legs had been hanging over
the side of the wharf, while their owners were intent upon certain
corks and lines that danced or quivered amid the waves below.
Now the lines were made fast to stone and log, while the small
fishermen stood agape to listen to the fluent orator.</p>

<p>This was but the nucleus of the gathering crowd. Every boy who
came near the eager circle must of course stop to find out what
was going on; and it was with no little pride that Blair beheld
the dozens of faces soon upturned to his.</p>

<p>Blair might have remembered that if there had been but a dead
dog in the centre of the group, there would have been an equal
gathering and pushing to know the cause of the meeting; but he,
like many an older speaker, was willing to attribute to his eloquence
what might have had even a humbler cause.</p>

<p>"Our rights invaded; a man's ship no longer his castle; the free
American forced to forsake his stars and stripes! The foot of
the Briton pollutes our decks. His tyrannical arm takes captive
our fathers, and dooms them to a servitude of which the world
knows no equal. Shall we submit? We will not submit. We have protested.
We have declared war to the death. Has Fairport a voice in this
matter? Where are those whom we love best? Where but upon the
wide sea, a prey to our remorseless enemy. Where is <em>your</em>
father, and <em>yours</em>, and <em>yours</em>, and <em>mine</em>?"
said Blair, making his appeal personal as he pointed to the sailors'
sons. "This insolence must be checked. We must rebuke the proud
Briton on the very scene of his abominations. We must triumph
over him on the tossing ocean, and teach him that America, not
Britannia, rules the waves. Would that we all stood on some staunch
ship, to do battle with our young right-arms. Then should Englishmen
cringe before us; then would we doom to sudden destruction their
boasted admirals and flimsy fleets. Down with the English! down
with the English!"</p>

<p>Blair stamped emphatically on his hollow throne, until it rang
again.</p>

<p>"Down with the English!" echoed the crowd in a burst of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>At this moment a short, stout lad came round a neighboring corner.
On his arm he carried a large basket of clean linen, with which
he now tried to elbow his way through the crowd.</p>

<p>"An English boy! Shame that he should show his face among us,"
said Blair in his excitement.</p>

<p>"We'll give him a taste of salt water," said two or three of
the oldest boys as they seized the stranger roughly by the shoulders.
"We'll teach him to mend his manners."</p>

<p>"Stop, stop, boys. Give him fair play," shouted Blair; but Blair
was no longer the object of attention.</p>

<p>The English boy, in spite of his struggles, was hurried to the
edge of the wharf, and pushed relentlessly over the brink.</p>

<p>A thorough ducking to him, and the scattering of his precious
basket of clothes, was all that the young rascals intended. To
their horror, the stranger sank like a heavy load&mdash;rose, and then
sank again.</p>

<p>"He can't swim; he can't swim. He'll be drowned!" burst from
the lips of the spectators. All were paralyzed with fear.</p>

<p>Blair had forced his way through the crowd, and reached the edge
of the wharf in time to see the pale, agonized face of the English
boy, as he for the second time rose to the surface. In another
moment Blair was diving where, far in the deep water, the pale
face had vanished from sight.</p>

<p>There was a moment of breathless silence, then a deafening cheer,
as Blair reappeared with the drowning boy in his arms.</p>

<p>There were hands enough outstretched to aid him in laying his
burden on the shore. "Help me carry him, boys, straight to our
house. Mother will know what to do for him," said Blair, speaking
very quickly.</p>

<p>It was but a few steps down a neighboring street to Joe Robertson's
pleasant home.</p>

<p>Blair did not fear to take in the dripping boy and lay him on
his mother's best bed. He knew that mother's joy was to minister
to the distressed and succor the unfortunate.</p>

<p>The water was soon pouring from the mouth, nose, and ears of
the unconscious lad. Then he was rubbed and wrapped round with
hot flannels, while Mrs. Robertson's own hands forced his lungs
to work, until they again took their natural movement.</p>

<p>Not a word was asked as to how the accident had happened, until,
out of danger, the rescued boy was in a sweet sleep.</p>

<p>The eager crowd who had followed Blair and his charge had vanished,
and the mother sat alone with her son. Blair's dripping garments
had been exchanged for another suit, but in the midst of the late
confusion his mother's eye had silently and gratefully marked
upon him the signs that to him the English boy owed his life.</p>

<p>"You saved him, my son. God be thanked. I may well be proud of
my boy," said the mother earnestly and fondly.</p>

<p>A sudden flush of shame crimsoned the cheeks of Blair Robertson.
"Oh, mother, it was all my fault," he exclaimed. "If he had died
&mdash;Oh, if he had died, that pale struggling face would have
haunted me to my grave. I had been making one of my speeches to
the boys, and it pleased me to see how I could rouse them. I had
just shouted 'Down with the English!' and made them join me, when
poor Hal came round the corner. Nobody would have noticed him
if I had gone right on; but I pointed him out, and angry as they
were, I could not stop them before they had thrown him into the
water. They thought he could swim, I dare say; but I knew he couldn't.
Oh, mother, what I suffered, thinking he might drown before I
could reach him. But he's safe now. You think he'll get well,
don't you, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my child," said Mrs. Robertson, trembling with deep feeling.
"God's mercy has been great to you, my boy. May you learn this
day a solemn lesson. You have a powerful influence over your companions.
You know it, and I am afraid it has only fed your pride, not prompted
you to usefulness. Is it real love for your country that leads
you to these speeches; or is it a desire to see how you can rouse
the passions of your listeners, and force them to do your bidding?
For every talent we must give an account, and surely for none
more strictly than the power to prompt men to good or evil. I
believe you love your country, my boy. You love our dear country,
or I would blush to own you as my son. But I fear you have as
yet but a poor idea what it is to be a true patriot."</p>

<p>"A true patriot, mother? I think I know what that means. One
who loves his country, and would cheerfully die for her," said
Blair with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"You might even love your country and die for her, and yet be
no <em>true</em> patriot," said the mother. "You might be her
disgrace, and the cause of her afflictions, while you shed for
her your heart's blood."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said the boy thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Korah and his company thought themselves patriots when
they rebelled against the power of Moses and Aaron. They doubtless
moved the people by cunning speeches about their own short-lived
honor; yet they brought destruction on themselves and a plague
upon Israel. There is nothing more plain in the Bible than God's
great regard to the righteousness or wickedness of <em>individual</em>
men. Suppose that there had been found ten righteous men in Sodom,
for whose sake that wicked city would have been spared its awful
doom. Humble and obscure they might have been; but would not they,
who brought such a blessing down on the neighborhood where they
dwelt, be worthy of the name of patriots? My son, if you were
willing to lay down your life for your country, and yet were guilty
of the foul sin of swearing, and taught all around you to blaspheme,
would you not be laying up wrath against your native land, though
you fought with the bravery of an Alexander? These are times to
think on these things, my boy, if we really love our country.
No man liveth unto himself. His home, his state, his country is
in a degree blessed or cursed for his sake. Dear Blair, you cannot
be a true patriot without God's grace to help you rule your heart,
guard your lips, and purify your life. May you this day begin,
for your own sake as well as for that of your country, to serve
the God of our fathers. He has mercifully spared you the bitter
self-reproach to which you might have been doomed. Go in repentance
to his footstool, and he will abundantly pardon. Resolve henceforward
to walk humbly before him, trusting in his grace and striving
to do his will, and you shall count this day the most blessed
of your life."</p>

<p>Mrs. Robertson put her arm round the tall, strong boy at her
side. He yielded to her touch, as if he had been a little child.
Side by side they knelt, while the mother poured out such a prayer
as can only flow from the lips of a Christian mother pleading
for her only son.</p>

<p>Blair Robertson spent that long Saturday evening alone in his
room. That was indeed to be the beginning of days to him. He was
no longer to be a self-willed seeker of his own pleasure and honor.
He was "bought with a price," and was henceforward to be a servant
of the King of kings.</p>
