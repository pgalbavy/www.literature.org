<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>That night, after Uncle Elk had left the bungalow, Alvin Landon,
Chester Haynes and Mike Murphy held what Alvin called a council
of war.</p>

<p>Sauntering a little way from the building, they sat down in the
silent depths of the woods where no one could overhear what was
said by them. Not that a Boy Scout would be guilty of eavesdropping,
but it was best that no inkling of what was in the air should
become accidentally known to others.</p>

<p>Without quoting all the conversation, let me make clear its substance.
The three were so mystified by the incidents already told that
they determined not to cease their efforts until the puzzle was
solved. They were the only Boy Scouts who knew the particulars,
and it was natural that their friends should give their chief
interest to fishing, rambling in the forest, studying trees, picking
up what they could of natural history, and laying in unnecessary
stores of health and strength.</p>

<p>One thing was certain: Uncle Elk knew the secret and he wouldn’t
tell. More than that, Chester Haynes startled his chums by the
declaration:</p>

<p>"So does Mr. Hall,—at least I am pretty sure he does."</p>

<p>"What reason have you for thinking that?" asked the astonished
Alvin.</p>

<p>"I have seen them more than once whispering in a way that showed
they were keenly interested."</p>

<p>"Did you hear anything that either said?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"How do you know then to what they were referring?"</p>

<p>"I don’t; I’m only guessing."</p>

<p>"I belave ye’re right," added Mike; "I obsarved the same thing
and had the same ’spicion, and would have spoke of it if Chest
hadn’t got ahead of me. But I’m thinking that if Mr. Hall knows
it all, why the mischief doesn’t he tell us afore we bust?"</p>

<p>"For the simple reason that Uncle Elk has bound him to secrecy.
No; what we find out must be done without the help of either."</p>

<p>"And we’ll doot!" exclaimed Mike, "or we’ll break a trace trying."</p>

<p>"How shall we go about it?" asked Alvin. "Whatever we do must
be done without either of them, especially Uncle Elk, knowing
it."</p>

<p>"And there’s the rub."</p>

<p>Bring three bright-witted boys together and let them concentrate
their mental energies upon the solution of a problem, and even
if they don’t succeed, they are sure to evolve something worth
while.</p>

<p>"It is useless to apply to Mr. Hall," said Alvin, "for nothing
could induce him to violate the confidence of another. But Uncle
Elk holds the master key and can speak when he chooses."</p>

<p>"Which the same is the rule with most folks," commented Mike.</p>

<p>"Now, see here," put in Chester; "he has shown a fondness for
you——"</p>

<p>"Can ye name any one of me acquaintances that hasn’t?" interrupted
the wag.</p>

<p>"Why can’t you set to work and coax it out of him?"</p>

<p>"Begorra! haven’t I tried more than once. I’ve hinted and asked
him straight out until I’m in the fix of Phil Rafferty."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"Phil took a notion that he could butt ivery other admirer of
Bridget Mulrooney off the track. He kipt at it till one day he
towld me he had a dim ’spicion that Bridget and her big brother
Tarn and her dad of the same name, not forgitting Bridget her-silf,
weren’t as fond of him as they oughter be. They had dropped purty
plain hints and the last time Phil called, Bridget remarked sorter
off-hand like, that she niver wanted to see his ugly mug agin.
Her brother kicked him off the porch and flung him over the fence
and the owld gintleman set their dog on him, which the same nearly
choked in trying to swaller the seat of his pants. Phil said he
was beginnin’ to ’spicion that the family took as a whole, didn’t
love him as they oughter. It’s the same wid Uncle Elk and me.
He’s riddy to talk on anything excipt the raison them two tramps
was scared into taking a bath, and he won’t throw any light on
that p’int."</p>

<p>"Then there is no use of either of us trying."</p>

<p>"I could hev towld ye that long ago."</p>

<p>Once more it was Chester who showed the most subtlety.</p>

<p>"Uncle Elk knows that Mike is doing all he can to solve the puzzle;
he knows he’ll not stop trying till he learns the truth; if Alvin
and I keep him company, he will understand that we have joined
forces. It will be as easy for him to baffle us three when we
are together as to defeat any one of us. Therefore we ought to
separate and each push the hunt for himself."</p>

<p>"Ye’ve hit it!" exclaimed Mike, "and to encourage ye in good
works and to show ye the honor ye oughter hev, I offers ye me
hand."</p>

<p>He gravely extended his palm in the gloom and it was warmly shaken.</p>

<p>Let a party of boys engage in some plot—and the same is true
of adults—and their chief fear is that it will be discovered and
defeated by someone else more or less interested. No precaution
must be neglected. It was agreed by our friends that no one of
them should drop a word in the hearing of others that could rouse
curiosity, and not to show by their manner that anything unusual
was on their minds.</p>

<p>One question considered was whether Dr. Spellman should be taken
into their confidence. He had witnessed the panic of the tramps
and was as curious as the boys to learn its cause. Alvin disposed
of the matter.</p>

<p>"I don’t see how he can be of any help and he doesn’t wish to
leave his home too long since the trouble he had with the bums.
Uncle Elk, for some reason, hates the doctor; the two would be
pretty sure to meet if the doctor joined forces with us, and the
consequences would be bad. Say what you please, Uncle Elk has
a queer twist in his brain, and I dread doing anything that will
excite him. Let us work independently of every one else."</p>

<p>"I’m wid ye," assented Mike, and Chester agreed.</p>

<p>This much decided upon, the particulars of the plan remained
to be arranged. Mike proposed that he should saunter off alone
to the western end of the lake, near where Alvin and Chester had
gone in the canoe during the day, and there with no companion
should set himself to learn what he could. The others would take
the opposite course, which would lead them to the home of Uncle
Elk. They had no intention of questioning the old man or even
letting him know what they had in mind, but would employ their
wits as opportunity offered.</p>

<p>Nothing would have been more pleasing than for Mike to use the
canoe to reach the western end of the lake, but he decided that
the safest course was for all three to let the boats alone. The
hermit would doubtless be on the watch and would know the errand
of the lads.</p>

<p>"Do we need to have signals?" asked Chester.</p>

<p>"What for?" inquired Alvin in turn.</p>

<p>"If one of us finds out something, he will want to tell the others."</p>

<p>"I don’t see how the plan can work, for we shall be so far apart
that any call we make will be heard by some of the Scouts and
may give the whole thing away. Whatever comes to light can wait
till we meet here after supper to-night."</p>

<p>Mike, who had been thoughtful for a minute or two, now spoke:</p>

<p>"We thought that being Mr. Hall’s lips are closed, Uncle Elk
is the only one that can ixplain the queer actions of Biggs and
Hutt, but Uncle Elk isn’t the only one."</p>

<p>"Who else can do so?"</p>

<p>"Biggs and Hutt."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Alvin, "but I don’t believe they would show
any more willingness than Uncle Elk. Besides, after such a fright
as they got yesterday, they are probably miles away at this minute
and still running."</p>

<p>"Which doesn’t signify that they won’t come back again. One would
think they would have taken the warning Dr. Spellman gave them,
but they didn’t. I believe there is going to be more trouble with
those two scamps," said Chester impressively.</p>

<p>"They’ve got to behave thimselves," added Mike with more feeling
than he had yet shown, "or I’ll git Mr. Hall to lead the whole
troop agin ’em."</p>

<p>"You know the Boy Scouts are opposed to all violence."</p>

<p>"And so’m I, excipt whin it’s yer dooty to lambaste the ither
chap, as whin he drops a hint that he doesn’t think ye’re able
to doot. If Biggs and Hutt go to stealing or stepping too hard
on us, do ye ixpect we’re going to grin and bear it?"</p>

<p>"Without answering that question," remarked Alvin, "let me suggest
that if any one of us happens to meet either or both the hoboes,
he does his best to get an explanation from them. If you don’t
succeed, no harm will be done."</p>

<p>"Good counsel," commented Chester, "but I don’t believe it will
bring any result."</p>

<p>"We mustn’t neglect anything——"</p>

<p>"Whisht!" interrupted Mike, suddenly laying his hand on the arm
of this comrade.</p>

<p>All three became silent, and each distinctly heard faint footfalls
from a point deeper in the wood.</p>

<p>"Some one has been listening," whispered Alvin, "but he couldn’t
have heard anything."</p>

<p>"And what if he did?" asked Chester; "we have no enemies in this
part of the world."</p>

<p>Mike had started in the direction of the suspicious sound. He
did not take time to soften the noise of his feet, and the stranger
thus warned hurried away. Evidently he was a better woodman than
his pursuer, for he got over the ground faster. Mike caught a
glimpse of him in the star-gleam, as he emerged on the beach and
ran off. A few minutes later the Irish youth rejoined his friends.</p>

<p>"Do you know who it was?" asked Alvin.</p>

<p>"No; he didn’t spake nor look back. I thought it best to return
to ye."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I hadn’t me shillaleh wid me, and I was in too much danger of
overhauling the spalpeen." </p>
