<p>The captain bought the Still-life.  This new version of himself
along with the poached egg and the sunflowers was rather
frightening.  So he packed up for Austria, for Kaprun, with his
picture, and had a fight to get the beastly thing out of Germany,
and another fight to get it into Austria.  Fatigued and furious he
arrived in Salzburg, seeing no beauty in anything.  Next day he was
in Kaprun.</p>

<p>It was an elegant and fashionable watering-place before the war: a
lovely little lake in the midst of the Alps, an old Tyrolese town
on the water-side, green slopes sheering up opposite, and away
beyond a glacier.  It was still crowded and still elegant.  But
alas, with a broken, bankrupt, desperate elegance, and almost empty
shops.</p>

<p>The captain felt rather dazed.  He found himself in an hotel full
of Jews of the wrong, rich sort, and wondered what next.  The place
was beautiful, but the life wasn't.</p>
