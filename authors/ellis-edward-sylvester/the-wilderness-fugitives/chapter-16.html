<p>Slowly and evenly, as the shadow steals along the face of the
dial, did the Mohawk draw the canoe from its resting place on
the dark bank of the river. One might have stood and gazed directly
at it for ten minutes without suspecting what was going on, it
being only when he compared its situation with what it was a short
time before that the difference was likely to be noticed. If the
Iroquois sentinel should be on the alert for some such strategy
on the part of the Mohawk, who was known to all as one of the
most cunning of his race, it would seem that the trick was impossible.
But there was every reason to hope that he did not suspect it,
as his action in returning to his first station after the brief
examination, showed, and the Mohawk acted on this belief.</p>

<p>The retrograde movement, once started, was not abated till the
boat was drawn clear of the shore and floated free in the water.
Then, without shifting its position as regarded the bank itself,
the motion was continued down the current, until some eight or
a dozen feet were passed. The hopes of Lena-Wingo were high, for
the fact that the sentinel had failed to discover what was going
on under his very eyes indicated that his suspicions were turned
in another direction. Even should he detect the change of position
on the part of the boat, there was reason to hope he would attribute
it to the action of the current, for the motion of the craft was
made to imitate such progression by the cunning Mohawk.</p>

<p>Something like half the distance was accomplished, when Lena-Wingo
made a change in his own position. Instead of remaining at the
stern of the canoe as he had done before, he changed to the side,
so that he could appear at the front or rear the moment the necessity
arose. The reason for this step was that he had progressed so
far that he was determined there should be no failure. The experiment
had in his eyes been an assured success. If the Iroquois should
appear and attempt to interfere, Lena-Wingo would meet him half
way, and dispose of him for all time to come. Fortunately for
the sentinel, he seemed to be unusually obtuse that night, and
allowed the daring scheme to be carried out under his very nose,
without objection on his part.</p>

<p>The motion of the canoe was not hastened in the least, but continued
in the same steady, uninterrupted manner till the point was reached
where the fugitives were anxiously awaiting the success of the
plan of the scout. The first indication the latter received of
what was done, and the approach of the Mohawk, was his cautious
"'Sh!" uttered just loud enough to reach their ears. Not one of
the three had been able to detect the slightest sound that indicated
what the scout was doing, so skillfully had he conducted the whole
affair. Ned returned the almost inaudible exclamation to apprise
their friend that they were expecting him. A minute later, the
Mohawk appeared among them with the silence of a shadow.</p>

<p>"All here?" was his rather curious question.</p>

<p>"All here," replied Ned.</p>

<p>"Boat ready&mdash;come along&mdash;make no noise."</p>

<p>The four stole forward after the manner of those who knew their
lives depended upon perfect silence, and they succeeded in reaching
the side of the stream without alarming the sentinel, who still
held a position dangerously near the fugitives. Rosa was the first
to enter, and she took her place in the extreme end, there being
no difference between the bow and stern of such a craft. Immediately
after her came Ned, who placed himself as close to her as possible.
Then followed the Mohawk, paddle in hand, Jo Minturn locating
himself in the prow, so as to give the Mohawk the best position
in which to manage the craft, and to "trim ship," as the expression
goes.</p>

<p>This was as the red scout wanted matters arranged; and when he
grasped the paddle it was with a greater confidence than he had
felt at any time during the night. But he had entered upon one
of the most perilous attempts conceivable, and he was sure the
trick would be detected within the succeeding five minutes. In
fact, it was discovered in less than that time; for he had no
more than fairly dipped the oar in the water than he heard a low,
vibrating whoop from the spot where the Mohawk was stationed.
That sound, as Lena-Wingo well knew, meant danger, and was intended
as a signal for his companions to hasten to the spot&mdash;a signal
that was sure to be promptly obeyed when more than a half dozen
were on the alert and waiting for just such a call. It was so
distinct that the whites accepted it as evidence that their flight
was discovered, and pursuit was sure to follow.</p>

<p>Rosa was much frightened, for she felt they had gone so far that
they could not return, and it was a question whether they would
reach the other side of the river in safety, or be captured on
the stream itself, with the probabilities in favor of the latter.
Everything depended upon the skill and sagacity of the Mohawk,
who showed himself equal to the occasion. At the same instant
that the sound mentioned reached his ear, he dipped his paddle
deep into the water, and sent the canoe, with one powerful sweep,
several rods down the bank, keeping so close to the land that
the leaves of the overhanging limbs brushed the heads of the occupants,
and compelled them to duck their heads. This done, he allowed
the boat to rest, while he listened to learn what his enemies
were doing. The sounds that fell upon his ear told him the flight
of the boat had been detected, and there could be no doubt that
the whole force of Iroquois would be engaged in the hunt in the
next few minutes. Without speaking, he dipped the paddle again,
and the canoe was driven as far as before down the stream; but,
in this instance, he did not permit it to rest, continuing the
process until he had gone fully a hundred yards from his starting
point. This done, he considered he had reached the point where
he could make a change in the direction, and he headed boldly
out into the river, aiming for the other shore, which had been
their destination so long, and which he was determined to make
this time.</p>

<p>The skill with which he controlled and swayed the ashen blade
was wonderful. The night was still, without a breath of air stirring
the tree-tops, but the instant the boat left the cover of the
bank, the faces of the whites were swept as if by a gale. At that
rate, the other shore would be made in a very short time, and
the action of the Mohawk indicated that such was his purpose,
guided, perhaps, by the hope that it might be done before the
alarm could reach those grouped on that side.</p>

<p>But they were as vigilant as the ones who had made the discovery
of the flight, and a whoop that came from some point ahead warned
the Mohawk that the passage was not to be as uneventful as he
expected. The worst of it was, the reply heard by all in the canoe
came from immediately in front, so that they had only to keep
on in the direction in which they were going to run straight into
ambush. At this time the fugitives were near the middle of the
Susquehanna, the night being so dark that they were invisible
to any upon either shore, and they were hardly liable to discovery
unless some of their enemies should start out upon the river in
quest of them. It was obviously the duty of the Mohawk to hold
that position, and move up or down stream, as might seem best.
The whites supposed he would continue down the current, but, to
their surprise, he headed straight against it, and sped upward
with astonishing speed.</p>
