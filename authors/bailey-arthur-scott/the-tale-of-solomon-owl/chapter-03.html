<p>It was a warm summer’s evening—so warm that Mr. Frog, the tailor, had
taken his sewing outside his tailor’s shop and seated himself cross-legged
upon the bank of the brook, where he sang and sewed without ceasing—except
to take a swim now and then in the cool water, “to stretch his legs,” as
he claimed.
</p>
<p>He was making a new suit of blue clothes for Jasper Jay. And since Jasper
was a great dandy, and very particular Mr. Frog was taking special pains
with his sewing.
</p><p>Usually he did his work quickly. But now after every five stitches that he
put into his work he stopped to take out ten. And naturally he was not
getting on very fast. He had been working busily since early morning; and
Jasper Jay’s suit was further than ever from being finished.
</p><p>Since he was a most cheerful person, Mr. Frog did not mind that. Indeed,
he was more than pleased, because the oftener he took a swim the fewer
stitches he lost. So he sang the merriest songs he knew.
</p><p>The light was fast fading when a hollow laugh startled Mr. Frog. It seemed
to come from the willow tree right over his head. And he knew without
looking up that it was Solomon Owl’s deep voice.
</p><p>Mr. Frog tried to leap into the brook. But when he uncrossed his legs, in
his haste he tangled them up in his sewing. And all he could do was to
turn a somersault backward among some bulrushes, hoping that Solomon Owl
had not seen him.
</p><p>It is no secret that Mr. Frog was terribly afraid of Solomon Owl. Some of
Mr. Frog’s friends had mysteriously disappeared. And they had last been
seen in Solomon’s company.
</p><p>As it happened, Mr. Frog had hoped in vain. For Solomon Owl only laughed
more loudly than before. And then he said:
</p><p>“What are you afraid of, Mr. Frog?”
</p><p>The tailor knew at once that he was caught. So he hopped nimbly to his
feet and answered that there was nothing to be afraid of, so far as he
could see.
</p><p>It was a true statement, too; because Mr. Frog had not yet discovered
Solomon Owl’s exact whereabouts.
</p><p>But he learned them soon; for Solomon immediately dropped down from the
big willow and alighted on the bank near Mr. Frog—altogether <u>too near</u>
him, in fact, for the tailor’s comfort.
</p><p>Solomon looked at Mr. Frog very solemnly. And he thought that he shivered.
</p><p>“What’s the matter? Are you ill?” Solomon Owl inquired. “You seem to be
shaking.”
</p><p>“Just a touch of chills and fever, probably!” replied Mr. Frog with an
uneasy smile. “You know it’s very damp here.”
</p><p>“You don’t look in the best of health—that’s a fact!” Solomon Owl
remarked. “You appear to me to be somewhat green in the face.” And he
laughed once more—that same hollow, mirthless laugh.
</p><p>Mr. Frog couldn’t help jumping, because the sound alarmed him.
</p><p>“Don’t be disturbed!” said Solomon Owl. “I like all the Frog family.”
</p><p>At that remark, Mr. Frog started violently That was exactly the trouble!
Solomon Owl was <u>altogether too fond</u> of frogs, whether they were old or
young, big or little.
</p><p>It was no wonder that Mr. Frog swallowed rapidly sixteen times before he
could say another word.
