<p>Down the slope, through the thicket, came a man. She could see
his legs only. He wore dust-coloured breeches and tan puttees,
like Sticky Smith’s and Kid Glenn’s, only he wore no big, clanking
Mexican spurs.</p>

<p>The man passed in front of her, his burly body barely visible
through the leaves, but not his features.</p>

<p>She rose, turned, ran over the moss, hurried through the ferns
of the warren, retracing her steps, and arrived breathless at
the <em>lavoir</em>. And scarcely had she dropped to her knees
and seized soap and paddle, than a squat, bronzed, powerfully
built young man appeared on the opposite bank of the stream, stepping
briskly out of the bushes.</p>

<p>He did not notice her at first. He looked about for a place to
jump, found one, leaped safely across, and came on at a swinging
stride across the meadow.</p>

<p>The girl, bending above the water, suddenly struck sharply with
her paddle.</p>

<p>Instantly the man halted in his tracks, knee deep in clover.</p>

<p>Maryette, apparently unconscious of his presence, continued to
soap and scrub and slap her wash, singing in her clear, untrained
voice of a child the chansonette she had made that morning. But
out of the corner of her eyes she kept him in view&mdash;saw him come
sauntering forward as though reassured, became aware that he had
approached very near, was standing behind her.</p>

<p>Turning presently, where she knelt, to pick up another soiled
garment, she suddenly encountered his dark gaze; and her start
and slight exclamation were entirely genuine.</p>

<p>"<em>Mon Dieu!</em>" she said, with offended emphasis, "one does
not approach people that way, without a word!"</p>

<p>"Did I frighten mademoiselle?" he asked, in recognizable French,
but with an accent unpleasantly familiar to her. "If I did, I
am very sorry and I offer mademoiselle a thousand excuses and
apologies."</p>

<p>The girl, kneeling there in the clover, flashed a smile at him
over her shoulder. The quick colour reddened his face and powerful
neck. The girl had been right; her smile had been an answer that
he was not going to ignore.</p>

<p>"What a pretty spot for a <em>lavoir</em>," he said, stepping
to the edge of the pool; "and what a pretty girl to adorn it!"</p>

<p>Maryette tossed her head:</p>

<p>"Be pleased to pass your way, monsieur. Do you not perceive that
I am busy?"</p>

<p>"It is not impossible to exchange a polite word or two when people
are busy, is it, mademoiselle?" he asked, laughing and showing
a white and perfect set of teeth under a short, dark mustache.</p>

<p>She continued to wring out her wash; but there was now a slight
smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"May I not say who I am?" he asked persuasively. "May I not venture
to speak?"</p>

<p>"<em>Mon dieu</em>, monsieur, there is liberty of speech for
all in France. That blackbird might be glad to know your name
if you choose to tell him."</p>

<p>"But I ask <em>your</em> permission to speak to <em>you</em>!"
There seemed to be no sense of humour in this young man.</p>

<p>She laughed:</p>

<p>"I am not curious to hear who you are!... But if it affords you
any relief to explain to the west wind what your name may be&mdash;"
She ended with a disdainful shrug. After a moment she lifted her
pretty eyes to his&mdash;lovely, provocative, tormenting eyes. But
they were studying the stranger closely.</p>

<p>He was a powerfully built, dark-skinned young man in the familiar
khaki of the American muleteers, wearing their insignia, their
cap, their holster and belt, and an extra pouch or wallet, loaded
evidently with something heavy.</p>

<p>She said, coolly:</p>

<p>"You must be one of the new Yankee muleteers who came with that
beautiful new herd of mules."</p>

<p>He laughed:</p>

<p>"Yes, I’m an American muleteer. My name is Charles Braun. I came
over in the last transport."</p>

<p>"You know Steek?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Steek! Monsieur Steekee Smeete?"</p>

<p>"Sticky Smith?"</p>

<p>"<em>Mais oui?</em>"</p>

<p>"I’ve met him," he replied curtly.</p>

<p>"And Monsieur Keed Glenn?"</p>

<p>"I’ve met Kid Glenn, too. Why?"</p>

<p>"They are friends of mine&mdash;very intimate friends. Of course,"
she added, nose up-tilted, "if they are not also <em>your</em>
friends, any acquaintance with me will be very difficult for <em>you</em>,
Monsieur Braun."</p>

<p>He laughed easily and seated himself on the grass beside her;
and, as he sat down, a metallic clinking sounded in his wallet.</p>

<p>"<em>Tenez</em>," she remarked, "you carry old iron and bottles
about with you, I notice."</p>

<p>"Snaffles, curbs and stirrup irons," he replied carelessly. And
in the girl’s heart there leaped the swift, fierce flame of certainty
in suspicion.</p>

<p>"Why do you bring all that ironmongery down here?" she inquired,
with frankly childish curiosity, leisurely wringing out her linen.</p>

<p>"A mule got away from the corral. I’ve been wandering around
in the bushes trying to find him," he explained, so naturally
and in such a friendly voice that she raised her eyes to look
again at this young gallant who lingered here at the <em>lavoir</em>
for the sake of her <em>beaux yeux</em>.</p>

<p>Could this dark-eyed, smiling youth be a Hun spy? His smooth,
boyish features, his crisp short hair and tiny mustache shading
lips a trifle too red and overfull did not displease her. In his
way he was handsome.</p>

<p>His voice, too, was attractive, gaily persuasive, but it was
his pronunciation of the letters c and d which had instantly set
her on her guard.</p>

<p>Seated on the bank near her, his roving eyes full of bold curiosity
bent on her from time to time, his idle fingers plaiting a little
wreath out of long-stemmed clover and <em>boutons d’or</em>, he
appeared merely an intrusive, irresponsible young fellow willing
to amuse himself with a few moments’ rustic courtship here before
he continued on his way.</p>

<p>"You are exceedingly pretty," he said. "Will you tell me your
name in exchange for mine?"</p>

<p>"Maryette Courtray."</p>

<p>"Oh," he exclaimed in quick recognition; "you are bell-mistress
in Sainte Lesse, then! <em>You</em> are the celebrated carillonnette!
I have heard about you. I suspected that you might be the little
mistress of Sainte Lesse bells, because you wear the Legion&mdash;"
He nodded his handsome head toward the decoration on her blouse.</p>

<p>"And to think," he added effusively, "that it is just a mere
slip of a girl who was decorated for bravery by France!"</p>

<p>She smiled at him with all the beguilingly <em>bête</em> innocence
of the young when flattered:</p>

<p>"You are too amiable, monsieur. I really do not understand why
they gave me the Legion. To encourage all French children, perhaps&mdash;because
I really am a dreadful coward." She tapped the holster on her
thigh and gazed at him quite guilelessly out of wide and trustful
eyes. "You see? I dare not even come here to wash my clothes unless
I carry this&mdash;in case some Boche comes prowling."</p>

<p>"Whose pistol is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The weapon belongs to Monsieur Steek. When I come to wash here
I borrow it."</p>

<p>"Are you the sweetheart of Monsieur Steek?" he inquired, mimicking
her pronunciation of "Stick," and at the same time fixing his
dark eyes boldly and expressively on hers.</p>

<p>"Does a young girl of my age have sweethearts?" she demanded
scornfully.</p>

<p>"If she hasn’t had one, it’s time," he returned, staring hard
at her with a persistent and fixed smile that had become almost
offensive.</p>

<p>"Oh, la!" she exclaimed with a shrug of her youthful shoulders.
"Perhaps you think I have time for such foolishness&mdash;what with
housework to do and washing, and caring for my father, and my
duties in the belfry every day!"</p>

<p>"Youth passes swiftly, belle Maryette."</p>

<p>"Imitate him, beau monsieur, and swiftly pass your way!"</p>

<p>"<em>L’amour est doux, petite Marie!</em>"</p>

<p>"<em>Je m’en moque!</em>"</p>

<p>He rose, smiling confidently, dropped on his knees beside her,
and rolled back his cuffs.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "I’ll help you wash. We two should finish quickly."</p>

<p>"I am in no haste."</p>

<p>"But it will give you an hour’s leisure, belle Maryette."</p>

<p>"Why should I wish for leisure, beau monsieur?"</p>

<p>"I shall try to instruct you why, when we have our hour together."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to pay court to me?"</p>

<p>"I am doing that now. My ardent courtship will already be accomplished,
so that we need not waste our hour together!" He began to laugh
and wring out the linen.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she expostulated smilingly, "your apropos disturbs
me. Have you the assurance to believe that you already appeal
to my heart?"</p>

<p>"Have I not appealed to it a little, Maryette?"</p>

<p>The girl averted her head coquettishly. For a few minutes they
scrubbed away there together, side by side on their knees above
the rim of the pool. Then, without warning, his hot, red lips
burned her neck. Her swift recoil was also a shudder; her face
flushed.</p>

<p>"Don’t do that!" she said sharply, straightening up in the grass
where she was kneeling.</p>

<p>"You are so adorable!" he pleaded in a low, tense voice.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. She had moved aside and away from him
on her knees; her head remained turned, too, and her features
were set as though carven out of rosy marble.</p>

<p>She was summoning every atom of resolution, every particle of
courage to do what she must do. Every fibre in her revolted with
the effort; but she steeled herself, and at last the forced smile
was stamped on her lips, and she dared turn her head and meet
his burning gaze.</p>

<p>"You frighten me," she said&mdash;and her unsteady voice was convincing.
"A young girl is not courted so abruptly."</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he murmured. "I could not help myself&mdash;your neck
is so fragrant, so childlike&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Then you should treat me as you would a child!" she retorted
pettishly. "Amuse me, if you aspire to any comradeship with me.
Your behaviour does not amuse me at all."</p>

<p>"We shall become comrades," he said confidently, "and you shall
be sufficiently amused."</p>

<p>"It requires time for two people to become comrades."</p>

<p>"Will you give me an hour this evening?"</p>

<p>"What? A rendezvous?" she exclaimed, laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You mean somewhere alone with you?"</p>

<p>"Will you, Maryette?"</p>

<p>"But why? I am not yet old enough for such foolishness. It would
not amuse me at all to be alone with you for an hour." She pouted
and shrugged and absently plucked a hollow stem from the sedge.</p>

<p>"It would amuse me much more to sit here and blow bubbles," she
added, clearing the stem with a quick breath and soaping the end
of it.</p>

<p>Then, with tormenting malice, she let her eyes rest sideways
on him while she plunged the hollow stem into the water, withdrew
it, dripping, and deliberately blew an enormous golden bubble
from the end.</p>

<p>"Look!" she cried, detaching the bubble, apparently enchanted
to see it float upward. "Is it not beautiful, my fairy balloon?"</p>

<p>On her knees there beside the basin she blew bubble after bubble,
detaching each with a slight movement of her wrist, and laughing
delightedly to see them mount into the sunshine.</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> a child," he said, worrying his red underlip
with his teeth. "You’re a baby, after all."</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"Very well, then, children require toys to amuse them, not sighs
and kisses and bold, brown eyes to frighten and perplex them.
Have you any toys to amuse me if I give you an hour with me?"</p>

<p>"Maryette, I can easily teach you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No! Will you bring me a toy to amuse me?&mdash;a clay pipe to blow
bubbles? I adore bubbles."</p>

<p>"If I promise to amuse you, will you give me an hour?" he asked.</p>

<p>"How can I?" she demanded with sudden caprice. "I have my wash
to finish; then I have to see that my father has his soup; then
I must attend to customers at the inn, go up to the belfry, oil
the machinery, play the carillon later, wind the drum for the
night&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I shall come to you in the tower after the angelus," he said
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I shall be too busy&#11834;"</p>

<p>"After the carillon, then! Promise, Maryette!"</p>

<p>"And sit up there alone with you in the dark for an hour? <em>Ma
foi!</em> How amusing!" She laughed in pretty derision. "I shall
not even be able to blow bubbles!"</p>

<p>Watching her pouting face intently, he said:</p>

<p>"Suppose I bring some toy balloons for you to fly from the clock
tower? Would that amuse you&mdash;you beautiful, perverse child?"</p>

<p>"Little toy balloons!" she echoed, enchanted. "What pleasure
to set them afloat from the belfry! Do you really promise to bring
me some little toy balloons to fly?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But <em>you</em> must promise not to speak about it to
anybody."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because the gendarmes wouldn’t let us fly any balloons."</p>

<p>"You mean that they might think me a spy?" she inquired naïvely.</p>

<p>"Or me," he rejoined with a light laugh. "So we shall have to
be very discreet and go cautiously about our sport. And it ought
to be great fun, Maryette, to sail balloons out over the German
trenches. We’ll tie a message to every one! Shall we, little comrade?"</p>

<p>She clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"That <em>will</em> enrage the Boches!" she cried, "You won’t
forget to bring the balloons?"</p>

<p>"After the carillon," he nodded, staring at her intently.</p>

<p>"Half past ten," she said; "not one minute earlier. I cannot
be disturbed when playing. Do you understand? Do you promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I promise not to bother you before half past
ten."</p>

<p>"Very well. Now let me do my washing here in peace."</p>

<p>She was still scrubbing her linen when he went reluctantly away
across the meadow toward Sainte Lesse. And when she finally stood
up, swung the basket to her head, and left the meadow, the sun
hung low behind Sainte Lesse Wood and a rose and violet glow possessed
the world.</p>

<p>At the White Doe Inn she flew feverishly about her duties, aiding
the ancient peasant woman with the simple preparations for dinner,
giving her father his soup and helping him to bed, swallowing
a mouthful herself as she hastened to finish her household tasks.</p>

<p>Kid Glenn came in as usual for an <em>aperitif</em> while she
was gathering up her wooden gloves.</p>

<p>"Did a mule stray today from your corral?" she asked, filling
his glass for him.</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Dead certain. Why?"</p>

<p>"Do you know one of the new muleteers named Braun?"</p>

<p>"I know him by sight."</p>

<p>"Keed!" she said, going up to him and placing both hands on his
broad shoulders; "I play the carillon after the angelus. Bring
Steek to the bell-tower half an hour after you hear the carillon
end. You will hear it end; you will hear the quarter hour strike
presently. Half an hour later, after the third quarter hour strikes,
you shall arrive. Bring pistols. Do you promise?"</p>

<p>"Sure! What’s the row, Maryette?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know yet. I <em>think</em> we shall find a spy in the
tower."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the belfry, <em>parbleu</em>! And you and Steek shall come
up the stairs and you shall wait in the dark, there where the
keyboard is, and where you see all the wires leading upward. You
shall listen attentively, and I will be on the landing above,
among my bells. And when you hear me cry out to you, then you
shall come running with pistols!"</p>

<p>"For heaven’s sake&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Is it understood? Give me your word, Keed!"</p>

<p>"Sure!&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Allons! Assez!</em>" she whispered excitedly. "Make prisoner
any man you see there!&mdash;<em>any</em> man! You understand?"</p>

<p>"You bet!"</p>

<p>"<em>Any man!</em>" she repeated slowly, "even if he wears the
same uniform <em>you</em> wear."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Then:</p>

<p>"By God!" said Glenn under his breath.</p>

<p>"You suspect?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And if it <em>is</em> one of our German-American muleteers,
we’ll lynch him!" he whispered in a white rage.</p>

<p>But Maryette shook her head.</p>

<p>"No," she said in a dull, even voice, "let the gendarmerie take
him in charge. Spy or suspect, he must have his chance. That is
the law in France."</p>

<p>"You don’t give rats a chance, do you?"</p>

<p>"I give everything its chance," she said simply. "And so does
my country."</p>

<p>She drew the automatic pistol from her holster, examined it,
raised her eyes gravely to the American beside her:</p>

<p>"This is terrible for me," she added, in a low but steady voice.
"If it were not for my country&mdash;" She made a grave gesture, turned,
and went slowly out through the arched stone passage into the
main street of the town. A few minutes later the angelus sounded
sweetly over the woods and meadows of Sainte Lesse.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<hr>

</p>
</div>
<p>At ten, as the last stroke of the hour ended, there came a charming,
intimate little murmur of awakening bells; it grew sweeter, clearer,
filling the starry sky, growing, exquisitely increasing in limpid,
transparent volume, sweeping through the high, dim belfry like
a great wind from Paradise carrying Heaven’s own music out over
the darkened earth.</p>

<p>All Sainte Lesse came to its doorways to listen to the playing
of their beloved Carillonnette; the bell-music ebbed and swelled
under the stars; the ancient Flemish masterpiece, written by some
carillonneur whose bones had long been dust, became magnificently
vital again under the enchanted hands of the little mistress of
the bells.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes the carillon ended; a slight pause followed,
then the quarter hour struck.</p>

<p>With the last stroke of the bell, the girl drew off her wooden
gloves, laid them on the keyboard, turned slowly in her seat,
listening. A slight sound coming from the spiral staircase of
stone set her heart beating violently. Had the suspected man violated
his word? She drew the automatic pistol from her holster, rose,
and stole up to the stone platform overhead, where, rising tier
on tier into the darkness, the great carillon of Sainte Lesse
loomed overhead.</p>

<p>She listened uneasily. Had the man lied? It seemed to her as
though her hammering heart must burst from her bosom with the
terrible suspense of the moment.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shadowy form appeared at the head of the stairs, reaching
the platform at one bound. And her heart seemed to stop as she
realized that this man had arrived too early for her friends to
be of any use to her. He had lied to her. And now she must take
him unaided, or kill him there in the starlight under the looming
bells.</p>

<p>"Maryette!" he called. She did not stir.</p>

<p>"Maryette!" he whispered. "Where are you, little sweetheart?
Forgive me, I could not wait any longer. I adore you&#11834;"</p>

<p>All at once he discovered her standing motionless in the shadow
of the great bell Bayard&mdash;sprang toward her, eager, ardent, triumphant.</p>

<p>"Maryette," he whispered, "I love you! I shall teach you what
a lover is&#11834;"</p>

<p>Suddenly he caught a glimpse of her face; the terrible expression
in her eyes checked him.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he asked, bewildered. And then he caught
sight of the pistol in her hand.</p>

<p>"What’s that for?" he demanded harshly. "Are you afraid to love
me? Do you think I’m the kind of lover to stop for a thing like
that&#11834;"</p>

<p>She said, in a low, distinct voice:</p>

<p>"Don’t move! Put up both hands instantly!"</p>

<p>"What!" he snapped out, like the crack of a lash.</p>

<p>"I know who you are. You’re a Boche and no Yankee! Turn your
back and raise your arms!"</p>

<p>For a moment they looked at each other.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, steadily, "you had better explain your gas
cylinders and balloons to the gendarmes at the Poste."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I’ll explain them to you, <em>now</em>!&#11834;"</p>

<p>"If you touch your pistol, I fire!&#11834;"</p>

<p>But already he had whipped out his pistol; and she fired instantly,
smashing his right hand to pulp.</p>

<p>"You damned hell-cat!" he screamed, stretching out his shattered
hand in an agony of impotent fury. Blood rained from it on the
stone flags. Suddenly he started toward her.</p>

<p>"Don’t stir!" she whispered. "Turn your back and raise both arms!"</p>

<p>His face became ghastly.</p>

<p>"Let me go, in God’s name!" he burst out in a strangled voice.
"Don’t send me before a firing squad! Listen to me, little comrade
&mdash;I surrender myself to your mercy&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Then keep away from me! Keep your distance!" she cried, retreating.
He followed, fawning:</p>

<p>"Listen! We were such good comrades&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don’t come any nearer to me!" she called out sharply; but he
still shuffled toward her, whimpering, drenched in blood, both
hands uplifted.</p>

<p>"Kamerad!" he whined, "Kamerad&mdash;" and suddenly launched a kick
at her.</p>

<p>She just avoided it, springing behind the bell Bayard; and he
rushed at her and struck with both uplifted arms, showering her
with blood, but not quite reaching her.</p>

<p>In the darkness among the beams and the deep shadows of the bells
she could hear him hunting for her, breathing heavily and making
ferocious, inarticulate noises, as she swung herself up onto the
first beam above and continued to crawl upward.</p>

<p>"Where are you, little fool?" he cried at length. "I have business
with you before I cut your throat&mdash;that smooth, white throat of
yours that I kissed down there by the <em>lavoir</em>!" There
was no sound from her.</p>

<p>He went back toward the stairs and began hunting about in the
starlight for his pistol; but there was no parapet on the bell
platform, and he probably concluded that it had fallen over the
edge of the tower into the street.</p>

<p>Supporting his wounded hand, he stood glaring blankly about him,
and his bloodshot eyes presently fell on the door to the stairs.
But he must have realized that flight would be useless for him
if he left this girl alive in her bell-tower, ready to alarm the
town the moment he ran for the stairs.</p>

<p>With his left hand he fumbled under his tunic and disengaged
a heavy trench knife from its sheath. The loss of blood was making
his legs a trifle unsteady, but he pulled himself together and
moved stealthily under the shadows of beam and bell until he came
to the spot he selected. And there he lay down, the hilt of the
knife in his left hand, the blade concealed by his opened tunic.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<hr>

</p>
</div>
<p>His heavy groans at last had their effect on the girl, who had
climbed high up into the darkness, creeping from beam to beam
and mounting from one tier of bells to another.</p>

<p>Standing on the lowest beam, she cautiously looked out through
an oubliette and saw him lying on his back near the sheer edge
of the roof.</p>

<p>Evidently he, also, could see her head silhouetted against the
stars, for he called up to her in a plaintive voice that he was
bleeding to death and unable to move.</p>

<p>After a few moments, opening his eyes again, he saw her standing
on the roof beside him, looking down at him. And he whispered
his appeal in the name of Christ. And in His name the little bell-mistress
responded.</p>

<p>When she had used the blue kerchief at her neck for a tourniquet
and had checked the hemorrhage, he was still patiently awaiting
a better opportunity to employ his knife. It would not do to bungle
the affair. And he thought he knew how it could be properly done&mdash;if
he could get her head in the crook of his muscular elbow.</p>

<p>"Lift me, dear ministering angel," he whispered weakly.</p>

<p>She stooped impulsively, hesitated, then, suddenly terrified
at the blazing ferocity in his eyes, she shrank back at the same
instant that his broad knife flashed in her very face.</p>

<p>He was on his feet at a bound, and, as she raised her voice in
a startled cry for help, he plunged heavily at her, but slipped
and fell in his own blood. Then the clattering jingle of spurred
boots on the stone stairs below caught his ear. He was trapped,
and he realized it. He slowly got to his feet.</p>

<p>As Smith and Glenn appeared, springing out of the low-arched
door, the muleteer Braun turned and faced them.</p>

<p>There was a silence, then Glenn said, bitterly:</p>

<p>"It’s you, is it, you dirty Dutchman!"</p>

<p>"Hands up!" said Smith quietly. "Come on, now; it’s a case of
’Kamerad’ for yours."</p>

<p>Braun did not move to comply with the demand. Gradually it dawned
on them that the man was game.</p>

<p>"Maryette!" he called; "where are you?"</p>

<p>Smith said curiously:</p>

<p>"What do you want with her, Braun?"</p>

<p>"I want to speak to her."</p>

<p>"Come over here, Maryette," said Glenn sullenly.</p>

<p>The girl crept out of the shadows. Her face was ghastly.</p>

<p>Braun looked at her with pallid scorn:</p>

<p>"You little, ignorant fool," he said, "I’d have made you a better
lover than you’ll ever have now!"</p>

<p>He shrugged his square shoulders in contempt, turned without
a glance at Smith and Glenn, and stepped outward into space. And
as he fell there between sky and earth, hurtling downward under
the stars, Glenn’s pistol flashed twice, killing his quarry in
midair while falling.</p>

<p>"Can you beat it?" he demanded hoarsely, turning on Smith. "Ain’t
that me all over!&mdash;soft-hearted enough to do that skunk a kindness
thataway!"</p>

<p>But his youthful voice was shaking, and he stared at the edge
of the abyss, listening to the far tumult now arising from the
street below.</p>

<p>"Did you shoot?" he inquired, controlling his nervous voice with
an effort.</p>

<p>"Naw," said Smith disgustedly. "... Now, Maryette, put one arm
around my neck, and me and the Kid will take you down them stairs,
because you look tired&mdash;kind o’ peeked and fussed, what with all
this funny business going on&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Steek! Steek!" she sobbed. "Oh, <em>mon ami</em>, Steek!"</p>

<p>She began to cry bitterly. Smith picked her up in his arms.</p>

<p>"What you need is sleep," he said very gently.</p>

<p>But she shook her head: she had business to transact on her knees
that night&mdash;business with the Mother of God that would take all
night long&mdash;and many, many other sleepless nights; and many candles.</p>

<p>She put her left arm around Smith’s neck and hid her tear-wet
face on his shoulder. And, as he bore her out of the high tower
and descended the unlighted, interminable stairs of stone, he
heard her weeping against his breast and softly asking intercession
in behalf of a dead young man who had tried to be to her a "Kamerad"&mdash;as
he understood it&mdash;including the entire gamut, from amorous beast
to fiend.</p>

<p>There was a single candle lighted in the bar of the White Doe.
On the "zinc," side by side, like birds on a rail, sat the two
muleteers. In each big, sunburnt fist was an empty glass; their
spurred feet dangled; they leaned forward where they sat, hunched
up over their knees, heads slightly turned, as though intently
listening. A haze of cigarette smoke dimmed the candle flame.</p>

<p>The drone of an aëroplane high in the midnight sky came to them
at intervals. At last the sound died away under the far stars.</p>

<p>By the smoky candle flame Kid Glenn unfolded and once more read
the letter that kept them there:</p>

&mdash;I ought to get to Sainte Lesse somewhere around midnight. Don’t<br/>
say a word to Maryette.

</p>
<p>
Jack.

</p>
</div>
<p>Sticky Smith, reading over his shoulder, slowly rolled another
cigarette.</p>

<p>"When Jack comes," he drawled, "it’s a-goin’ to he’p a lot. That
Maryette girl’s plumb done in."</p>

<p>"Sure she’s done in," nodded Kid Glenn. "Wouldn’t it do in anybody
to shoot up a young man an’ then see him step off the top of a
skyscraper?"</p>

<p>Smith admitted that he himself had felt "kind er squeamish."
He added: "Gawd, how he spread when he hit them flags! You didn’t
look at him, did you, Kid?"</p>

<p>"Naw. Say, d’ya think Maryette has gone to bed?"</p>

<p>"I dunno. When we left her up there in her room, I turned and
took a peek to see she was comfy, but she was down onto both knees
before that china virgin on the niche over her bed."</p>

<p>"She oughter be in bed. You gotta sleep off a thing like that,
or you feel punk next day," remarked Glenn, meditatively twirling
the last drops of eau-de-vie around in his tumbler. Then he swallowed
them and smacked his lips. "She’ll come around all O. K. when
she sees Jack," he added.</p>

<p>"Goin’ to let him wake her up?"</p>

<p>"Can you see us stoppin’ him? He’d kick the pants off us&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!" motioned Smith; "there’s a automobile! By gum! It’s
stopped!&#11834;"</p>

<p>The two muleteers set their glasses on the bar, slid to the floor,
and marched, clanking, into the covered way that led to the street.
Smith undid the bolts. A young man stood outside in the starlight.</p>

<p>"Well, Jack Burley, you old son of a gun!" drawled Glenn. "Gawd!
You look fit for a dead one!"</p>

<p>"We ain’t told her!" whispered Smith. "She an’ us done in a Fritz
this evening, an’ it sorter turned Maryette’s stomach&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Not that she ain’t well," explained Glenn hastily; "only a girl
feels different. Stick an’ me, we just took a few drinks, but
Maryette, soon as she got home, she just flopped down on her knees
and asked that china virgin of hers to go easy on that there Fritz&#11834;"</p>

<p>They had conducted Burley to the bar; both their arms were draped
around his shoulders; both talked to him at the same time.</p>

<p>"This here Fritz," began Glenn&mdash;but Burley freed himself from
their embrace.</p>

<p>"Where’s Maryette?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Smith jerked a silent thumb toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>"In bed?"</p>

<p>"Or prayin’."</p>

<p>Burley flushed, hesitated.</p>

<p>"G’wan up, anyway," said Glenn. "I reckon it’ll do her a heap
o’ good to lamp you, you old son of a gun!"</p>

<p>Burley turned, went up the short flight of stairs to her closed
door. There was candle-light shining through the transom. He knocked
with a trembling hand. There was no answer. He knocked again;
heard her uncertain step; stepped back as her door opened.</p>

<p>The girl, a drooping figure in her night robe, stood listlessly
on the threshold. Which of the muleteers it was who had come to
her door she did not notice. She said:</p>

<p>"I am very tired. Death is a dreadful thing. I can’t put it from
my mind. I am trying to pray&#11834;"</p>

<p>She lifted her weary eyes and found herself looking into the
face of her own lover. She turned very white, lovely eyes dilated.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is it thou, Djack?"</p>

<p>"C’est moi, ma ploo belle!"</p>

<p>She melted into his tightening arms with a faint cry. Very high
overhead, under the lustrous stars, an aëroplane droned its uncharted
way across a blood-soaked world.</p>
