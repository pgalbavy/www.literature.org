<p>Next morning Arthur cashed his cheque, and started on his travels. He
had no very clear idea why he was going back to Madeira, or what he
meant to do when he got there; but then, at this painful stage of his
existence, none of his ideas could be called clear. Though he did not
realize it, what he was searching for was sympathy, female sympathy of
course; for in trouble members of either sex gravitate instinctively
to the other for comfort. Perhaps they do not quite trust their own,
or perhaps they are afraid of being laughed at.
</p>
<p>Arthur's was not one of those natures that can lock their griefs
within the bosom, and let them lie there till in process of time they
shrivel away. Except among members of the peerage, as pictured in
current literature, these stern, proud creatures are not common. Man,
whether he figures in the world as a peer or a hedge-carpenter, is, as
a matter of fact, mentally as well as physically, gregarious, and
adverse to loneliness either in his joys or sorrows.
</p><p>Decidedly, too, the homoeopathic system must be founded on great
natural facts, and there is philosophy, born of the observation of
human nature, in the somewhat vulgar proverb that recommends a "hair
of the dog that bit you." Otherwise, nine men out of every ten who
have been badly treated, or think that they have been badly treated,
by a woman, would not at once rush headlong for refuge to another, a
proceeding which also, in nine cases out of ten, ends in making
confusion worse confounded.
</p><p>Arthur, though he was not aware of it, was exemplifying a natural law
that has not yet been properly explained. But, even if he had known
it, it is doubtful if the knowledge would have made him any happier;
for it is irritating to reflect that we are the slaves of natural
laws, that our action is not the outcome of our own volition, but of a
vague force working silently as the Gulf Stream--since such knowledge
makes a man measure his weakness, and so strikes at his tenderest
point, his vanity.
</p><p>But, whilst we have been reflecting together, my reader and I, Arthur
was making his way to Madeira, so we may as well all come to a halt
off Funchal.
</p><p>Very shortly after the vessel had dropped her anchor, Arthur was
greeted by his friend, the manager of "Miles' Hotel."
</p><p>"Glad to see you, sir, though I can't say that you look well. I
scarcely expected to find anybody for us at this time of year.
Business is very slack in the summer."
</p><p>"Yes, I suppose that Madeira is pretty empty."
</p><p>"There is nobody here at all, sir."
</p><p>"Is Mrs. Carr gone, then?" asked Arthur, in some alarm.
</p><p>"No; she is still here. She has not been away this year. But she has
been very quiet; no parties or anything, which makes people think that
she has lost money."
</p><p>By this time the boat was rising on the roll of the last billow, to be
caught next moment by a dozen hands, and dragged up the shingle. It
was evening, or rather, verging that way, and from under the magnoliatrees 
below the cathedral there came the sound of the band summoning
the inhabitants of Funchal to congregate, chatter, and flirt.
</p><p>"I think," said Arthur, "that I will ask you to take my things up to
the hotel. I will come by-and-by. I should like the same room I had
before, if it is empty."
</p><p>"Very good, Mr. Heigham. You will have the place nearly all to
yourself now."
</p><p>Having seen his baggage depart, Arthur turned, and resisting the
importunities of beggars, guides, and parrot-sellers, who had not yet
recognized him as an old hand, made his way towards the Quinta Carr.
How well he knew the streets and houses, even to the withered faces of
the women who sat by the doors, and yet he seemed to have grown old
since he had seen them. Ten minutes of sharp walking brought him to
the gates of the Quinta, and he paused before them, and thought how, a
few months ago, he had quitted them, miserable at the grief of
another, now to re-enter them utterly crushed by his own.
</p><p>He walked on through the beautiful gardens to the house. The hall-door
stood open. He did not wait to ring, but, driven by some impulse,
entered. After the glare of the sun, which at that time of the year
was powerful even in its decline, the carefully shaded hall seemed
quite dark. But by degrees his eyes adapted themselves to the altered
light, and began to distinguish the familiar outline of the furniture.
Next they travelled to the door of the drawing-room, where another
sight awaited them. For there, herself a perfect picture, standing in
the doorway for a frame, her hands outstretched in welcome, and a
loving smile upon her lips, was Mildred.
</p><p>"I was waiting for you," she said, gently. "I thought that you would
come."
</p><p>"Mildred, my idol has been cast down, and, as you told me to do, I
have come back to you."
</p><p>"Dear," she answered, "you are very welcome."
</p><p>And then came Miss Terry, pleased with all her honest heart to see
him, and utterly ignorant of the fierce currents that swept under the
smooth surface of their little social sea. Miss Terry was not by
nature a keen observer.
</p><p>"Dear me, Mr. Heigham, who would have thought of seeing you again so
soon? You <u>are</u> brave to cross the bay so often" (her thoughts ran a
great deal on the Bay of Biscay); "but I don't think you look quite
well, you have such black lines under your eyes, and, I declare,
there's a grey hair!"
</p><p>"Oh, I assure you your favourite bay was enough to turn anybody's hair
grey, Miss Terry."
</p><p>And so, talking cheerfully, they went in to the pleasant little
dinner, Mildred leaning over so slightly on his arm, and gazing into
his sad face with full and happy eyes. After all that he had gone
through, it seemed to Arthur as though he had dropped into a haven of
rest.
</p><p>"See here," said Mildred, when they rose from table, "a wonder has
come to pass since you deserted us. Look, sceptic that you are!" and
she led him to the window, and, lifting a glass shade which protected
a flower-pot, showed him a green spike peeping from the soil.
</p><p>"What is that?"
</p><p>"What is it?--why, it is the mummy hyacinth which you declared that we
should never see blossom in this world. It has budded; whether or not
it will blossom, who can say?"
</p><p>"It is an omen," he said, with a little laugh; and for the first time
that evening their eyes met.
</p><p>"Come into the garden, and you can smoke on the museum verandah; it is
pleasant there these hot nights."
</p><p>"It is dangerous, your garden."
</p><p>She laughed softly. "You have proved yourself superior to danger."
</p><p>Then they passed out together. The evening was still and very sultry.
Not a breath stirred the silence of the night. The magnolia, the moonflower, 
and a thousand other blooms poured out their fragrance upon
the surrounding air, where it lay in rich patches, like perfume thrown
on water. A thin mist veiled the sea, and the little wavelets struck
with a sorrowful sound against the rock below.
</p><p>"Tell me all about it, Arthur."
</p><p>She had settled herself upon a long low chair, and as she leant back
the starlight glanced white upon her arms and bosom.
</p><p>"There is not much to tell. It is a common story--at least, I believe
so. She threw me over, and the day before I should have married her,
married another man."
</p><p>"Well?"
</p><p>"Well, I saw her the morning following her marriage. I do not remember
what I said, but I believe I spoke what was in my mind. She fainted,
and I left her."
</p><p>"Ah, you spoke harshly, perhaps."
</p><p>"Spoke harshly! Now that I have had time to think of it, I wish that I
could have had ten imaginations to shape my thoughts, and ten tongues
to speak them with! Do you understand what this woman has done? She
has sold herself to a brute--oh, Mildred, such a brute--she has
deserted me for a man who is not even a gentleman."
</p><p>"Perhaps she was forced into it."
</p><p>"Forced!--nonsense; we are not in the Middle Ages. A good woman should
have been forced to drown herself before she consented to commit such
a sacrilege against herself as to marry a man she hated. But she, 'my
love, my dove, my undefiled'--she whom I thought whiter than the snow
--she could do this, and do it deliberately. I had rather have seen
her dead, and myself dead with her."
</p><p>"Don't you take a rather exaggerated view, Arthur? Don't you think,
perhaps, that some of the fault lies with you for overrating women?
Believe me, so far as my experience goes, and I have seen a good many,
the majority of them do not possess the exalted purity of mind you and
many very young men attribute to them. They are, on the contrary, for
the most part quite ready to exercise a wise discretion in the matter
of marriage, even when the feeble tendencies which represent their
affections point another way. A little pressure goes a long way with
them; they are always glad to make the most of it; it is the dust they
throw up to hide their retreat. Your Angela, for instance, was no
doubt, and probably still is, very fond of you. You are a charming
young man, with nice eyes and a taking way with women, and she would
very much have liked to marry you; but then she also liked her
cousin's estates. She could not have both, and, being forced to
choose, she chose the latter. You should take a common-sense view of
the matter; you are not the first who has suffered. Women, especially
young women, who do not understand the value of affection, must be
very much in love before they submit to the self-sacrifice that is
supposed to be characteristic of them, and what men talk of as stains
upon them they do not consider as such. They know, if they know
nothing else, that a good income and an establishment will make them
perfectly clean in the opinion of their own small world--a little
world of shams and forms that cares nothing for the spirit of the
moral law, provided the letter is acted up to. It is by this that they
mark their standard of personal virtues, not by the high rule you men
imagine for them. There is no social fuller's soap so effectual as
money and position."
</p><p>"You speak like a book, and give your own sex a high character. Tell
me, then, would you do such a thing?"
</p><p>"I, Arthur? How can you ask me? I had rather be torn to pieces by wild
horses. I spoke of the majority of the women, not of them all."
</p><p>"Ah, and yet she could do it, and I thought her better than you."
</p><p>"I do not think that you should speak bitterly of her, Arthur; I think
that you should be sorry for her."
</p><p>"Sorry for her? Why?"
</p><p>"Because from what I have gathered about her, she is not quite an
ordinary young woman: however badly she may have treated you, she is a
person of refined feelings and susceptibilities. Is it not so?"
</p><p>"Without a doubt."
</p><p>"Well, then, you should pity her, because she will bitterly expiate
her mistake. For myself, I do not pity her much, because I will not
waste my sympathy on a fool; for, to my mind, the woman who could do
what she has done, and deliberately throw away everything that can
make life really worth living to us women, is a most contemptible
fool. But you love her, and, therefore, you should be sorry for her."
</p><p>"But why?"
</p><p>"Because she is a woman who at one-and-twenty has buried all the
higher part of life, who has, of her own act, for ever deprived
herself of joys that nothing else can bring her. Love, true love, is
almost the only expression, of which we women are capable, of all the
nobler instincts and vague yearnings after what is higher and better
than the things we see and feel around us. When we love most, and love
happily, then we are at our topmost bent, and soar further above the
earth than anything else can carry us. Consequently, when a woman is
faithless to her love, which is the purest and most honourable part of
her, the very best thing to which she can attain, she clips her wings,
and can fly no more, but must be tossed, like a crippled gull, hither
and thither upon the stormy surface of her little sea. Of course, I
speak of women of the higher stamp. Many, perhaps most, will feel
nothing of all this. In a little while they will grow content with
their dull round and the alien nature which they have mated with, and
in their children, and their petty cares and dissipations, will forget
that they possess a higher part, if indeed they do possess it. Like
everything else in the world, they find their level. But with women
like your Angela it is another thing. For them time only serves to
increasingly unveil the Medusa-headed truth, till at last they see it
as it is, and their hearts turn to stone. Backed with a sick longing
to see a face that is gone from them, they become lost spirits,
wandering everlastingly in the emptiness they have chosen, and finding
no rest. Even her children will not console her."
</p><p>Arthur uttered a smothered exclamation.
</p><p>"Don't start, Arthur; you <u>must</u> accustom yourself to the fact that
that woman has passed away from you, and is as completely the personal
property of another man, as that chair is mine. But, there, the
subject is a painful one to you; shall we change it?"
</p><p>"It is one that you seem to have studied pretty deeply."
</p><p>"Yes, because I have realized its importance to a woman. For some
years I have longed to be able to fall in love, and when at last I did
so, Arthur," and here her voice grew very soft, "it was with a man who
could care nothing for me. Such has been my unlucky chance. That a
woman, herself beloving and herself worthily beloved, could throw her
blessed opportunity away is to me a thing inconceivable, and that,
Arthur, is what your Angela has done."
