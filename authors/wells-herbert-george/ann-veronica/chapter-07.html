And now for some weeks Ann Veronica was to test her market value
in the world.  She went about in a negligent November London that
had become very dark and foggy and greasy and forbidding indeed,
and tried to find that modest but independent employment she had
so rashly assumed.  She went about, intent-looking and
self-possessed, trim and fine, concealing her emotions whatever
they were, as the realities of her position opened out before
her.  Her little bed-sitting-room was like a lair, and she went
out from it into this vast, dun world, with its smoke-gray
houses, its glaring streets of shops, its dark streets of homes,
its orange-lit windows, under skies of dull copper or muddy gray
or black, much as an animal goes out to seek food.  She would
come back and write letters, carefully planned and written
letters, or read some book she had fetched from Mudie's--she had
invested a half-guinea with Mudie's--or sit over her fire and
think.
<P>
Slowly and reluctantly she came to realize that Vivie Warren was
what is called an "ideal."  There were no such girls and no such
positions.  No work that offered was at all of the quality she
had vaguely postulated for herself.  With such qualifications as
she possessed, two chief channels of employment lay open, and
neither attracted her, neither seemed really to offer a
conclusive escape from that subjection to mankind against which,
in the person of her father, she was rebelling.  One main avenue
was for her to become a sort of salaried accessory wife or
mother, to be a governess or an assistant schoolmistress, or a
very high type of governess-nurse.  The other was to go into
business --into a photographer's reception-room, for example, or
a costumer's or hat-shop.  The first set of occupations seemed to
her to be altogether too domestic and restricted; for the latter
she was dreadfully handicapped by her want of experience.  And
also she didn't like them.  She didn't like the shops, she didn't
like the other women's faces; she thought the smirking men in
frock-coats who dominated these establishments the most
intolerable persons she had ever had to face.  One called her
very distinctly "My dear!"
<P>
Two secretarial posts did indeed seem to offer themselves in
which, at least, there was no specific exclusion of womanhood;
one was under a Radical Member of Parliament, and the other under
a Harley Street doctor, and both men declined her proffered
services with the utmost civility and admiration and terror.
There was also a curious interview at a big hotel with a
middle-aged, white-powdered woman, all covered with jewels and
reeking of scent, who wanted a Companion. She did not think Ann
Veronica would do as her companion.
<P>
And nearly all these things were fearfully ill-paid. They carried
no more than bare subsistence wages; and they demanded all her
time and energy.  She had heard of women journalists, women
writers, and so forth; but she was not even admitted to the
presence of the editors she demanded to see, and by no means sure
that if she had been she could have done any work they might have
given her.  One day she desisted from her search and went
unexpectedly to the Tredgold College.  Her place was not filled;
she had been simply noted as absent, and she did a comforting day
of admirable dissection upon the tortoise.  She was so
interested, and this was such a relief from the trudging anxiety
of her search for work, that she went on for a whole week as if
she was still living at home.  Then a third secretarial opening
occurred and renewed her hopes again: a position as
amanuensis--with which some of the lighter duties of a nurse were
combined--to an infirm gentleman of means living at Twickenham,
and engaged upon a great literary research to prove that the
"Faery Queen" was really a treatise upon molecular chemistry
written in a peculiar and picturesquely handled cipher.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 2
<P>
<P>
Now, while Ann Veronica was taking these soundings in the
industrial sea, and measuring herself against the world as it is,
she was also making extensive explorations among the ideas and
attitudes of a number of human beings who seemed to be largely
concerned with the world as it ought to be.  She was drawn first
by Miss Miniver, and then by her own natural interest, into a
curious stratum of people who are busied with dreams of world
progress, of great and fundamental changes, of a New Age that is
to replace all the stresses and disorders of contemporary life.
<P>
Miss Miniver learned of her flight and got her address from the
Widgetts.  She arrived about nine o'clock the next evening in a
state of tremulous enthusiasm. She followed the landlady half way
up-stairs, and called up to Ann Veronica, "May I come up?  It's
me!  You know--Nettie Miniver!"  She appeared before Ann Veronica
could clearly recall who Nettie Miniver might be.
<P>
There was a wild light in her eye, and her straight hair was out
demonstrating and suffragetting upon some independent notions of
its own.  Her fingers were bursting through her gloves, as if to
get at once into touch with Ann Veronica.  "You're Glorious!"
said Miss Miniver in tones of rapture, holding a hand in each of
hers and peering up into Ann Veronica's face.  "Glorious! You're
so calm, dear, and so resolute, so serene!
<P>
"It's girls like you who will show them what We are," said Miss
Miniver; "girls whose spirits have not been broken!"
<P>
Ann Veronica sunned herself a little in this warmth.
<P>
"I was watching you at Morningside Park, dear," said Miss
Miniver.  "I am getting to watch all women. I thought then
perhaps you didn't care, that you were like so many of them.  NOW
it's just as though you had grown up suddenly."
<P>
She stopped, and then suggested:  "I wonder--I should love--if it
was anything _I_ said."
<P>
She did not wait for Ann Veronica's reply.  She seemed  to assume
that it must certainly be something she had said.  "They all
catch on," she said.  "It spreads like wildfire.  This is such a
grand time!  Such a glorious time!  There never was such a time
as this!  Everything seems so close to fruition, so coming on and
leading on!  The Insurrection of Women!  They spring up
everywhere.  Tell me all that happened, one sister-woman to
another."
<P>
She chilled Ann Veronica a little by that last phrase, and yet
the magnetism of her fellowship and enthusiasm was very strong;
and it was pleasant to be made out a heroine after so much
expostulation and so many secret doubts.
<P>
But she did not listen long; she wanted to talk.  She sat,
crouched together, by the corner of the hearthrug under the
bookcase that supported the pig's skull, and looked into the fire
and up at Ann Veronica's face, and let herself go.  "Let us put
the lamp out," she said; "the flames are ever so much better for
talking," and Ann Veronica agreed.  "You are coming right out
into life--facing it all."
<P>
Ann Veronica sat with her chin on her hand, red-lit and saying
little, and Miss Miniver discoursed.  As she talked, the drift
and significance of what she was saying shaped itself slowly to
Ann Veronica's apprehension. It presented itself in the likeness
of a great, gray, dull world--a brutal, superstitious, confused,
and wrong-headed world, that hurt people and limited people
unaccountably.  In remote times and countries its evil tendencies
had expressed themselves in the form of tyrannies, massacres,
wars, and what not; but just at present in England they shaped as
commercialism and competition, silk hats, suburban morals, the
sweating system, and the subjection of women.  So far the thing
was acceptable enough.  But over against the world Miss Miniver
assembled a small but energetic minority, the Children of
Light--people she described as "being in the van," or "altogether
in the van," about whom Ann Veronica's mind was disposed to be
more sceptical.
<P>
Everything, Miss Miniver said, was "working up," everything was
"coming on"--the Higher Thought, the Simple Life, Socialism,
Humanitarianism, it was all the same really.  She loved to be
there, taking part in it all, breathing it, being it.  Hitherto
in the world's history there had been precursors of this Progress
at great intervals, voices that had spoken and ceased, but now it
was all coming on together in a rush.  She mentioned, with
familiar respect, Christ and Buddha and Shelley and Nietzsche and
Plato.  Pioneers all of them.  Such names shone brightly in the
darkness, with black spaces of unilluminated emptiness about
them, as stars shine in the night; but now--now it was different;
now it was dawn--the real dawn.
<P>
"The women are taking it up," said Miss Miniver; "the women and
the common people, all pressing forward, all roused."
<P>
Ann Veronica listened with her eyes on the fire.
<P>
"Everybody is taking it up," said Miss Miniver. "YOU had to come
in.  You couldn't help it.  Something drew you.  Something draws
everybody.  From suburbs, from country towns--everywhere.  I see
all the Movements.  As far as I can, I belong to them all. I keep
my finger on the pulse of things."
<P>
Ann Veronica said nothing.
<P>
"The dawn!" said Miss Miniver, with her glasses reflecting the
fire like pools of blood-red flame.
<P>
"I came to London," said Ann Veronica, "rather because of my own
difficulty.  I don't know that I understand altogether."
<P>
"Of course you don't," said Miss Miniver, gesticulating
triumphantly with her thin hand and thinner wrist, and patting
Ann Veronica's knee.  "Of course you don't. That's the wonder of
it.  But you will, you will.  You must let me take you to
things--to meetings and things, to conferences and talks.  Then
you will begin to see. You will begin to see it all opening out. 
I am up to the ears in it all--every moment I can spare.  I throw
up work--everything!  I just teach in one school, one good
school, three days a week.  All the rest--Movements! I can live
now on fourpence a day.  Think how free that leaves me to follow
things up!  I must take you everywhere. I must take you to the
Suffrage people, and the Tolstoyans, and the Fabians."
<P>
"I have heard of the Fabians," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"It's THE Society!" said Miss Miniver.  "It's the centre of the
intellectuals.  Some of the meetings are wonderful!  Such
earnest, beautiful women!  Such deep-browed men! . . .  And to
think that there they are making history!  There they are putting
together the plans of a new world.  Almos light-heartedly.  There
is Shaw, and Webb, and Wilkins the author, and Toomer, and Doctor
Tumpany--the most wonderful people! There you see them
discussing, deciding, planning! Just think--THEY ARE MAKING A NEW
WORLD!"
<P>
"But ARE these people going to alter everything?" said Ann
Veronica.
<P>
"What else can happen?" asked Miss Miniver, with a little weak
gesture at the glow.  "What else can possibly happen--as things
are going now?"
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 3
<P>
<P>
Miss Miniver let Ann Veronica into her peculiar levels of the
world with so enthusiastic a generosity that it seemed
ingratitude to remain critical.  Indeed, almost insensibly Ann
Veronica became habituated to the peculiar appearance and the
peculiar manners of the people "in the van."  The shock of their
intellectual attitude was over, usage robbed it of the first
quaint effect of deliberate unreason.  They were in many respects
so right; she clung to that, and shirked more and more the
paradoxical conviction that they were also somehow, and even in
direct relation to that rightness, absurd.
<P>
Very central in Miss Miniver's universe were the Goopes.  The
Goopes were the oddest little couple conceivable, following a
fruitarian career upon an upper floor in Theobald's Road.  They
were childless and servantless, and they had reduced simple
living to the finest of fine arts.  Mr. Goopes, Ann Veronica
gathered, was a mathematical tutor and visited schools, and his
wife wrote a weekly column in New Ideas upon vegetarian cookery,
vivisection, degeneration, the lacteal secretion, appendicitis,
and the Higher Thought generally, and assisted in the management
of a fruit shop in the Tottenham Court Road.  Their very
furniture had mysteriously a high-browed quality, and Mr. Goopes
when at home dressed simply in a pajama-shaped suit of canvas
sacking tied with brown ribbons, while his wife wore a purple
djibbah with a richly embroidered yoke.  He was a small, dark,
reserved man, with a large inflexible-looking convex forehead,
and his wife was very pink and high-spirited, with one of those
chins that pass insensibly into a full, strong neck.  Once a
week, every Saturday, they had a little gathering from nine till
the small hours, just talk and perhaps reading aloud and
fruitarian refreshments--chestnut sandwiches buttered with nut
tose, and so forth--and lemonade and unfermented wine; and to one
of these symposia Miss Miniver after a good deal of preliminary
solicitude, conducted Ann Veronica.
<P>
She was introduced, perhaps a little too obviously for her taste,
as a girl who was standing out against her people, to a gathering
that consisted of a very old lady with an extremely wrinkled skin
and a deep voice who was wearing what appeared to Ann Veronica's
inexperienced eye to be an antimacassar upon her head, a shy,
blond young man with a narrow forehead and glasses, two
undistinguished women in plain skirts and blouses, and a
middle-aged couple, very fat and alike in black, Mr. and Mrs.
Alderman Dunstable, of the Borough Council of Marylebone.  These
were seated in an imperfect semicircle about a very
copper-adorned fireplace, surmounted by a carved wood
inscription:
<P>
                    "DO IT NOW."
<P>
And to them were presently added a roguish-looking young man,
with reddish hair, an orange tie, and a fluffy tweed suit, and
others who, in Ann Veronica's memory, in spite of her efforts to
recall details, remained obstinately just "others."
<P>
The talk was animated, and remained always brilliant in form even
when it ceased to be brilliant in substance. There were moments
when Ann Veronica rather more than suspected the chief speakers
to be, as school-boys say, showing off at her.
<P>
They talked of a new substitute for dripping in vegetarian
cookery that Mrs. Goopes was convinced exercised an exceptionally
purifying influence on the mind.  And then they talked of
Anarchism and Socialism, and whether the former was the exact
opposite of the latter or only a higher form.  The reddish-haired
young man contributed allusions to the Hegelian philosophy that
momentarily confused the discussion.  Then Alderman Dunstable,
who had hitherto been silent, broke out into speech and went off
at a tangent, and gave his personal impressions of quite a number
of his fellow-councillors.  He continued to do this for the rest
of the evening intermittently, in and out, among other topics. He
addressed himself chiefly to Goopes, and spoke as if in reply to
long-sustained inquiries on the part of Goopes into the personnel
of the Marylebone Borough Council.  "If you were to ask me," he
would say, "I should say Blinders is straight.  An ordinary type,
of course--"
<P>
Mrs. Dunstable's contributions to the conversation were entirely
in the form of nods; whenever Alderman Dunstable praised or
blamed she nodded twice or thrice, according to the requirements
of his emphasis.  And she seemed always to keep one eye on Ann
Veronica's dress.  Mrs. Goopes disconcerted the Alderman a little
by abruptly challenging the roguish-looking young man in the
orange tie (who, it seemed, was the assistant editor of New
Ideas) upon a critique of Nietzsche and Tolstoy that had appeared
in his paper, in which doubts had been cast upon the perfect
sincerity of the latter. Everybody seemed greatly concerned about
the sincerity of Tolstoy.
<P>
Miss Miniver said that if once she lost her faith in Tolstoy's
sincerity, nothing she felt would really matter much any more,
and she appealed to Ann Veronica whether she did not feel the
same; and Mr. Goopes said that we must distinguish between
sincerity and irony, which was often indeed no more than
sincerity at the sublimated level.
<P>
Alderman Dunstable said that sincerity was often a matter of
opportunity, and illustrated the point to the fair young man with
an anecdote about Blinders on the Dust Destructor Committee,
during which the young man in the orange tie succeeded in giving
the whole discussion a daring and erotic flavor by questioning
whether any one could be perfectly sincere in love.
<P>
Miss Miniver thought that there was no true sincerity except in
love, and appealed to Ann Veronica, but the young man in the
orange tie went on to declare that it was quite possible to be
sincerely in love with two people at the same time, although
perhaps on different planes with each individual, and deceiving
them both.  But that brought Mrs. Goopes down on him with the
lesson Titian teaches so beautifully in his "Sacred and Profane
Love," and became quite eloquent upon the impossibility of any
deception in the former.
<P>
Then they discoursed on love for a time, and Alderman Dunstable,
turning back to the shy, blond young man and speaking in
undertones of the utmost clearness, gave a brief and confidential
account of an unfounded rumor of the bifurcation of the
affections of Blinders that had led to a situation of some
unpleasantness upon the Borough Council.
<P>
The very old lady in the antimacassar touched Ann Veronica's arm
suddenly, and said, in a deep, arch voice:
<P>
"Talking of love again; spring again, love again. Oh! you young
people!"
<P>
The young man with the orange tie, in spite of Sisyphus-like
efforts on the part of Goopes to get the topic on to a higher
plane, displayed great persistence in speculating upon the
possible distribution of the affections of highly developed
modern types.
<P>
The old lady in the antimacassar said, abruptly, "Ah! you young
people, you young people, if you only knew!" and then laughed and
then mused in a marked manner; and the young man with the narrow
forehead and glasses cleared his throat and asked the young man
in the orange tie whether he believed that Platonic love was
possible.  Mrs. Goopes said she believed in nothing else, and
with that she glanced at Ann Veronica, rose a little abruptly,
and directed Goopes and the shy young man in the handing of
refreshments.
<P>
But the young man with the orange tie remained in his place,
disputing whether the body had not something or other which he
called its legitimate claims. And from that they came back by way
of the Kreutzer Sonata and Resurrection to Tolstoy again.
<P>
So the talk went on.  Goopes, who had at first been a little
reserved, resorted presently to the Socratic method to restrain
the young man with the orange tie, and bent his forehead over
him, and brought out at last very clearly from him that the body
was only illusion and everything nothing but just spirit and
molecules of thought.  It became a sort of duel at last between
them, and all the others sat and listened--every one, that is,
except the Alderman, who had got the blond young man into a
corner by the green-stained dresser with the aluminum things, and
was sitting with his back to every one else, holding one hand
over his mouth for greater privacy, and telling him, with an
accent of confidential admission, in whispers of the chronic
struggle between the natural modesty and general inoffensiveness
of the Borough Council and the social evil in Marylebone.
<P>
So the talk went on, and presently they were criticising
novelists, and certain daring essays of Wilkins got their due
share of attention, and then they were discussing the future of
the theatre.  Ann Veronica intervened a little in the novelist
discussion with a defence of Esmond and a denial that the Egoist
was obscure, and when she spoke every one else stopped talking
and listened.  Then they deliberated whether Bernard Shaw ought
to go into Parliament.  And that brought them to vegetarianism
and teetotalism, and the young man in the orange tie and Mrs.
Goopes had a great set-to about the sincerity of Chesterton and
Belloc that was ended by Goopes showing signs of resuming the
Socratic method.
<P>
And at last Ann Veronica and Miss Miniver came down the dark
staircase and out into the foggy spaces of the London squares,
and crossed Russell Square, Woburn Square, Gordon Square, making
an oblique route to Ann Veronica's lodging.  They trudged along a
little hungry, because of the fruitarian refreshments, and
mentally very active.  And Miss Miniver fell discussing whether
Goopes or Bernard Shaw or Tolstoy or Doctor Tumpany or Wilkins
the author had the more powerful and perfect mind in existence at
the present time. She was clear there were no other minds like
them in all the world.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 4
<P>
<P>
Then one evening Ann Veronica went with Miss Miniver into the
back seats of the gallery at Essex Hall, and heard and saw the
giant leaders of the Fabian Society who are re-making the world: 
Bernard Shaw and Toomer and Doctor Tumpany and Wilkins the
author, all displayed upon a platform.  The place was crowded,
and the people about her were almost equally made up of very
good-looking and enthusiastic young people and a great variety of
Goopes-like types.  In the discussion there was the oddest
mixture of things that were personal and petty with an idealist
devotion that was fine beyond dispute.  In nearly every speech
she heard was the same implication of great and necessary changes
in the world--changes to be won by effort and sacrifice indeed,
but surely to be won.  And afterward she saw a very much larger
and more enthusiastic gathering, a meeting of the advanced
section of the woman movement in Caxton Hall, where the same note
of vast changes in progress sounded; and she went to a soiree of
the Dress Reform Association and visited a Food Reform
Exhibition, where imminent change was made even alarmingly
visible.  The women's meeting was much more charged with
emotional force than the Socialists'.  Ann Veronica was carried
off her intellectual and critical feet by it altogether, and
applauded and uttered cries that subsequent reflection failed to
endorse.  "I knew you would feel it," said Miss Miniver, as they
came away flushed and heated.  "I knew you would begin to see how
it all falls into place together."
<P>
It did begin to fall into place together.  She became more and
more alive, not so much to a system of ideas as to a big diffused
impulse toward change, to a great discontent with and criticism
of life as it is lived, to a clamorous confusion of ideas for
reconstruction--reconstruction of the methods of business, of
economic development, of the rules of property, of the status of
children, of the clothing and feeding and teaching of every one;
she developed a quite exaggerated consciousness of a multitude of
people going about the swarming spaces of London with their minds
full, their talk and gestures full, their very clothing charged
with the suggestion of the urgency of this pervasive project of
alteration.  Some indeed carried themselves, dressed themselves
even, rather as foreign visitors from the land of "Looking
Backward" and "News from Nowhere" than as the indigenous
Londoners they were.  For the most part these were detached
people: men practising the plastic arts, young writers, young men
in employment, a very large proportion of girls and women--self-
supporting women or girls of the student class.  They made a
stratum into which Ann Veronica was now plunged up to her neck;
it had become her stratum.
<P>
None of the things they said and did were altogether new to Ann
Veronica, but now she got them massed and alive, instead of by
glimpses or in books--alive and articulate and insistent.  The
London backgrounds, in Bloomsbury and Marylebone, against which
these people went to and fro, took on, by reason of their gray
facades, their implacably respectable windows and window-blinds,
their reiterated unmeaning iron railings, a stronger and stronger
suggestion of the flavor of her father at his most obdurate
phase, and of all that she felt herself fighting against.
<P>
She was already a little prepared by her discursive reading and
discussion under the Widgett influence for ideas and "movements,"
though temperamentally perhaps she was rather disposed to resist
and criticise than embrace them.  But the people among whom she
was now thrown through the social exertions of Miss Miniver and
the Widgetts--for Teddy and Hetty came up from Morningside Park
and took her to an eighteen-penny dinner in Soho and introduced
her to some art students, who were also Socialists, and so opened
the way to an evening of meandering talk in a studio--carried
with them like an atmosphere this implication, not only that the
world was in some stupid and even obvious way WRONG, with which
indeed she was quite prepared to agree, but that it needed only a
few pioneers to behave as such and be thoroughly and
indiscriminately "advanced," for the new order to achieve itself.
<P>
When ninety per cent. out of the ten or twelve people one meets
in a month not only say but feel and assume a thing, it is very
hard not to fall into the belief that the thing is so. 
Imperceptibly almost Ann Veronica began to acquire the new
attitude, even while her mind still resisted the felted ideas
that went with it.  And Miss Miniver began to sway her.
<P>
The very facts that Miss Miniver never stated an argument
clearly, that she was never embarrassed by a sense of
self-contradiction, and had little more respect for consistency
of statement than a washerwoman has for wisps of vapor, which
made Ann Veronica critical and hostile at their first encounter
in Morningside Park, became at last with constant association the
secret of Miss Miniver's growing influence.  The brain tires of
resistance, and when it meets again and again, incoherently
active, the same phrases, the same ideas that it has already
slain, exposed and dissected and buried, it becomes less and less
energetic to repeat the operation. There must be something, one
feels, in ideas that achieve persistently a successful
resurrection.  What Miss Miniver would have called the Higher
Truth supervenes.
<P>
Yet through these talks, these meetings and conferences, these
movements and efforts, Ann Veronica, for all that she went with
her friend, and at times applauded with her enthusiastically, yet
went nevertheless with eyes that grew more and more puzzled, and
fine eyebrows more and more disposed to knit.  She was with these
movements--akin to them, she felt it at times intensely--and yet
something eluded her.  Morningside Park had been passive and
defective; all this rushed about and was active, but it was still
defective. It still failed in something.  It did seem germane to
the matter that so many of the people "in the van" were plain
people, or faded people, or tired-looking people. It did affect
the business that they all argued badly and were egotistical in
their manners and inconsistent in their phrases.  There were
moments when she doubted whether the whole mass of movements and
societies and gatherings and talks was not simply one coherent
spectacle of failure protecting itself from abjection by the
glamour of its own assertions.  It happened that at the extremest
point of Ann Veronica's social circle from the Widgetts was the
family of the Morningside Park horse-dealer, a company of
extremely dressy and hilarious young women, with one equestrian
brother addicted to fancy waistcoats, cigars, and facial spots. 
These girls wore hats at remarkable angles and bows to startle
and kill; they liked to be right on the spot every time and up to
everything that was it from the very beginning and they rendered
their conception of Socialists and all reformers by the words
"positively frightening" and "weird."  Well, it was beyond
dispute that these words did convey a certain quality of the
Movements in general amid which Miss Miniver disported herself. 
They WERE weird.  And yet for all that--
<P>
It got into Ann Veronica's nights at last and kept her awake, the
perplexing contrast between the advanced thought and the advanced
thinker.  The general propositions of Socialism, for example,
struck her as admirable, but she certainly did not extend her
admiration to any of its exponents.  She was still more stirred
by the idea of the equal citizenship of men and women, by the
realization that a big and growing organization of women were
giving form and a generalized expression to just that personal
pride, that aspiration for personal freedom and respect which had
brought her to London; but when she heard Miss Miniver
discoursing on the next step in the suffrage campaign, or read of
women badgering Cabinet Ministers, padlocked to railings, or
getting up in a public meeting to pipe out a demand for votes and
be carried out kicking and screaming, her soul revolted.  She
could not part with dignity.  Something as yet unformulated
within her kept her estranged from all these practical aspects of
her beliefs.
<P>
"Not for these things, O Ann Veronica, have you revolted," it
said; "and this is not your appropriate purpose."
<P>
It was as if she faced a darkness in which was something very
beautiful and wonderful as yet unimagined. The little pucker in
her brows became more perceptible.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 5
<P>
<P>
In the beginning of December Ann Veronica began to speculate
privately upon the procedure of pawning. She had decided that she
would begin with her pearl necklace.  She spent a very
disagreeable afternoon and evening--it was raining fast outside,
and she had very unwisely left her soundest pair of boots in the
boothole of her father's house in Morningside Park--thinking over
the economic situation and planning a course of action. Her aunt
had secretly sent on to Ann Veronica some new warm underclothing,
a dozen pairs of stockings, and her last winter's jacket, but the
dear lady had overlooked those boots.
<P>
These things illuminated her situation extremely. Finally she
decided upon a step that had always seemed reasonable to her, but
that hitherto she had, from motives too faint for her to
formulate, refrained from taking.  She resolved to go into the
City to Ramage and ask for his advice.  And next morning she
attired herself with especial care and neatness, found his
address in the Directory at a post-office, and went to him.
<P>
She had to wait some minutes in an outer office, wherein three
young men of spirited costume and appearance regarded her with
ill-concealed curiosity and admiration.  Then Ramage appeared
with effusion, and ushered her into his inner apartment.  The
three young men exchanged expressive glances.
<P>
The inner apartment was rather gracefully furnished with a thick,
fine Turkish carpet, a good brass fender, a fine old bureau, and
on the walls were engravings of two young girls' heads by Greuze,
and of some modern picture of boys bathing in a sunlit pool.
<P>
"But this is a surprise!" said Ramage.  "This is wonderful!  I've
been feeling that you had vanished from my world.  Have you been
away from Morningside Park?"
<P>
"I'm not interrupting you?"
<P>
"You are.  Splendidly.  Business exists for such interruptions. 
There you are, the best client's chair."
<P>
Ann Veronica sat down, and Ramage's eager eyes feasted on her.
<P>
"I've been looking out for you," he said.  "I confess it."
<P>
She had not, she reflected, remembered how prominent his eyes
were.
<P>
"I want some advice," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"Yes?"
<P>
"You remember once, how we talked--at a gate on the Downs?  We
talked about how a girl might get an independent living."
<P>
"Yes, yes."
<P>
"Well, you see, something has happened at home."
<P>
She paused.
<P>
"Nothing has happened to Mr. Stanley?"
<P>
"I've fallen out with my father.  It was about--a question of
what I might do or might not do.  He--In fact, he--he locked me
in my room.  Practically."
<P>
Her breath left her for a moment.
<P>
"I SAY!" said Mr. Ramage.
<P>
"I wanted to go to an art-student ball of which he disapproved."
<P>
"And why shouldn't you?"
<P>
"I felt that sort of thing couldn't go on.  So I packed up and
came to London next day."
<P>
"To a friend?"
<P>
"To lodgings--alone."
<P>
"I say, you know, you have some pluck.  You did it on your own?"
<P>
Ann Veronica smiled.  "Quite on my own," she said.
<P>
"It's magnificent!"  He leaned back and regarded her with his
head a little on one side.  "By Jove!" he said, "there is
something direct about you.  I wonder if I should have locked you
up if I'd been your father. Luckily I'm not.  And you started out
forthwith to fight the world and be a citizen on your own basis?"
He came forward again and folded his hands under him on his desk.
<P>
"How has the world taken it?" he asked.  "If I was the world I
think I should have put down a crimson carpet, and asked you to
say what you wanted, and generally walk over me.  But the world
didn't do that."
<P>
"Not exactly."
<P>
"It presented a large impenetrable back, and went on thinking
about something else."
<P>
"It offered from fifteen to two-and-twenty shillings a week--for
drudgery."
<P>
"The world has no sense of what is due to youth and courage.  It
never has had."
<P>
"Yes," said Ann Veronica.  "But the thing is, I want a job."
<P>
"Exactly!  And so you came along to me.  And you see, I don't
turn my back, and I am looking at you and thinking about you from
top to toe."
<P>
"And what do you think I ought to do?"
<P>
"Exactly!"  He lifted a paper-weight and dabbed it gently down
again.  "What ought you to do?"
<P>
"I've hunted up all sorts of things."
<P>
"The point to note is that fundamentally you don't want
particularly to do it."
<P>
"I don't understand."
<P>
"You want to be free and so forth, yes.  But you don't
particularly want to do the job that sets you free--for its own
sake.  I mean that it doesn't interest you in itself."
<P>
"I suppose not."
<P>
"That's one of our differences.  We men are like children.  We
can get absorbed in play, in games, in the business we do. 
That's really why we do them sometimes rather well and get on. 
But women--women as a rule don't throw themselves into things
like that.  As a matter of fact it isn't their affair.  And as a
natural consequence, they don't do so well, and they don't get
on--and so the world doesn't pay them. They don't catch on to
discursive interests, you see, because they are more serious,
they are concentrated on the central reality of life, and a
little impatient of its--its outer aspects.  At least that, I
think, is what makes a clever woman's independent career so much
more difficult than a clever man's."
<P>
"She doesn't develop a specialty."  Ann Veronica was doing her
best to follow him.
<P>
"She has one, that's why.  Her specialty is the central thing in
life, it is life itself, the warmth of life, sex--and love."
<P>
He pronounced this with an air of profound conviction and with
his eyes on Ann Veronica's face.  He had an air of having told
her a deep, personal secret. She winced as he thrust the fact at
her, was about to answer, and checked herself.  She colored
faintly.
<P>
"That doesn't touch the question I asked you," she said.  "It may
be true, but it isn't quite what I have in mind."
<P>
"Of course not," said Ramage, as one who rouses himself from deep
preoccupations And he began to question her in a business-like
way upon the steps she had taken and the inquiries she had made. 
He displayed none of the airy optimism of their previous talk
over the downland gate.  He was helpful, but gravely dubious. 
"You see," he said, "from my point of view you're grown
up--you're as old as all the goddesses and the contemporary of
any man alive.  But from the--the economic point of view you're a
very young and altogether inexperienced person."
<P>
He returned to and developed that idea.  "You're still," he said,
"in the educational years.  From the point of view of most things
in the world of employment which a woman can do reasonably well
and earn a living by, you're unripe and half-educated.  If you
had taken your degree, for example."
<P>
He spoke of secretarial work, but even there she would need to be
able to do typing and shorthand. He made it more and more evident
to her that her proper course was not to earn a salary but to
accumulate equipment.  "You see," he said, "you are like an
inaccessible gold-mine in all this sort of matter. You're
splendid stuff, you know, but you've got nothing ready to sell. 
That's the flat business situation."
<P>
He thought.  Then he slapped his hand on his desk and looked up
with the air of a man struck by a brilliant idea.  "Look here,"
he said, protruding his eyes; "why get anything to do at all just
yet?  Why, if you must be free, why not do the sensible thing? 
Make yourself worth a decent freedom.  Go on with your studies at
the Imperial College, for example, get a degree, and make
yourself good value.  Or become a thorough-going typist and
stenographer and secretarial expert."
<P>
"But I can't do that."
<P>
"Why not?"
<P>
"You see, if I do go home my father objects to the College, and
as for typing--"
<P>
"Don't go home."
<P>
"Yes, but you forget; how am I to live?"
<P>
"Easily.  Easily. . . .  Borrow. . . .  From me."
<P>
"I couldn't do that," said Ann Veronica, sharply.
<P>
"I see no reason why you shouldn't."
<P>
"It's impossible."
<P>
"As one friend to another.  Men are always doing it, and if you
set up to be a man--"
<P>
"No, it's absolutely out of the question, Mr. Ramage." And Ann
Veronica's face was hot.
<P>
Ramage pursed his rather loose lips and shrugged his shoulders,
with his eyes fixed steadily upon her.  "Well anyhow-- I don't
see the force of your objection, you know.  That's my advice to
you.  Here I am.  Consider you've got resources deposited with
me.  Perhaps at the first blush--it strikes you as odd.  People
are brought up to be so shy about money.  As though it was
indelicate--it's just a sort of shyness.  But here I am to
draw upon.  Here I am as an alternative either to nasty work--or
going home."
<P>
"It's very kind of you--" began Ann Veronica.
<P>
"Not a bit.  Just a friendly polite suggestion.  I don't suggest
any philanthropy.  I shall charge you five per cent., you know,
fair and square."
<P>
Ann Veronica opened her lips quickly and did not speak.  But the
five per cent. certainly did seem to improve the aspect of
Ramage's suggestion.
<P>
"Well, anyhow, consider it open."  He dabbed with his
paper-weight again, and spoke in an entirely indifferent tone. 
"And now tell me, please, how you eloped from Morningside Park. 
How did you get your luggage out of the house?  Wasn't it--wasn't
it rather in some respects--rather a lark?  It's one of my
regrets for my lost youth.  I never ran away from anywhere with
anybody anywhen.  And now--I suppose I should be considered too
old.  I don't feel it. . . .  Didn't you feel rather EVENTFUL--in
the train--coming up to Waterloo?"
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 6
<P>
<P>
Before Christmas Ann Veronica had gone to Ramage again and
accepted this offer she had at first declined.
<P>
Many little things had contributed to that decision. The chief
influence was her awakening sense of the need of money.  She had
been forced to buy herself that pair of boots and a
walking-skirt, and the pearl necklace at the pawnbrokers' had
yielded very disappointingly.  And, also, she wanted to borrow
that money.  It did seem in so many ways exactly what Ramage said
it was--the sensible thing to do.  There it was--to be borrowed.
It would put the whole adventure on a broader and better footing;
it seemed, indeed, almost the only possible way in which she
might emerge from her rebellion with anything like success.  If
only for the sake of her argument with her home, she wanted
success.  And why, after all, should she not borrow money from
Ramage?
<P>
It was so true what he said; middle-class people WERE
ridiculously squeamish about money.  Why should they be?
<P>
She and Ramage were friends, very good friends.  If she was in a
position to help him she would help him; only it happened to be
the other way round.  He was in a position to help her.  What was
the objection?
<P>
She found it impossible to look her own diffidence in the face. 
So she went to Ramage and came to the point almost at once.
<P>
"Can you spare me forty pounds?" she said.
<P>
Mr. Ramage controlled his expression and thought very quickly.
<P>
"Agreed," he said, "certainly," and drew a checkbook toward him.
<P>
"It's best," he said, "to make it a good round sum.
<P>
"I won't give you a check though-- Yes, I will. I'll give you an
uncrossed check, and then you can get it at the bank here, quite
close by. . . .  You'd better not have all the money on you; you
had better open a small account in the post-office and draw it
out a fiver at a time.  That won't involve references, as a bank
account would--and all that sort of thing.  The money will last
longer, and--it won't bother you."
<P>
He stood up rather close to her and looked into her eyes.  He
seemed to be trying to understand something very perplexing and
elusive.  "It's jolly," he said, "to feel you have come to me. 
It's a sort of guarantee of confidence.  Last time--you made me
feel snubbed."
<P>
He hesitated, and went off at a tangent.  "There's no end of
things I'd like to talk over with you.  It's just upon my
lunch-time.  Come and have lunch with me."
<P>
Ann Veronica fenced for a moment.  "I don't want to take up your
time."
<P>
"We won't go to any of these City places.  They're just all men,
and no one is safe from scandal.  But I know a little place where
we'll get a little quiet talk."
<P>
Ann Veronica for some indefinable reason did not want to lunch
with him, a reason indeed so indefinable that she dismissed it,
and Ramage went through the outer office with her, alert and
attentive, to the vivid interest of the three clerks.  The three
clerks fought for the only window, and saw her whisked into a
hansom. Their subsequent conversation is outside the scope of our
story.
<P>
"Ritter's!" said Ramage to the driver, "Dean Street."
<P>
It was rare that Ann Veronica used hansoms, and to be in one was
itself eventful and exhilarating.  She liked the high, easy swing
of the thing over its big wheels, the quick clatter-patter of the
horse, the passage of the teeming streets.  She admitted her
pleasure to Ramage.
<P>
And Ritter's, too, was very amusing and foreign and discreet; a
little rambling room with a number of small tables, with red
electric light shades and flowers.  It was an overcast day,
albeit not foggy, and the electric light shades glowed warmly,
and an Italian waiter with insufficient English took Ramage's
orders, and waited with an appearance of affection.  Ann Veronica
thought the whole affair rather jolly.  Ritter sold better food
than most of his compatriots, and cooked it better, and Ramage,
with a fine perception of a feminine palate, ordered Vero Capri. 
It was, Ann Veronica felt, as a sip or so of that remarkable
blend warmed her blood, just the sort of thing that her aunt
would not approve, to be lunching thus, tete-a-tete with a man;
and yet at the same time it was a perfectly innocent as well as
agreeable proceeding.
<P>
They talked across their meal in an easy and friendly manner
about Ann Veronica's affairs.  He was really very bright and
clever, with a sort of conversational boldness that was just
within the limits of permissible daring.  She described the
Goopes and the Fabians to him, and gave him a sketch of her
landlady; and he talked in the most liberal and entertaining way
of a modern young woman's outlook.  He seemed to know a great
deal about life.  He gave glimpses of possibilities. He roused
curiosities.  He contrasted wonderfully with the empty
showing-off of Teddy.  His friendship seemed a thing worth
having. . . .
<P>
But when she was thinking it over in her room that evening vague
and baffling doubts came drifting across this conviction.  She
doubted how she stood toward him and what the restrained gleam of
his face might signify. She felt that perhaps, in her desire to
play an adequate part in the conversation, she had talked rather
more freely than she ought to have done, and given him a wrong
impression of herself.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 7
<P>
<P>
That was two days before Christmas Eve.  The next morning came a
compact letter from her father.
<P>
<P>
"MY DEAR DAUGHTER," it ran,--"Here, on the verge of the season of
forgiveness I hold out a last hand to you in the hope of a
reconciliation.  I ask you, although it is not my place to ask
you, to return home.  This roof is still open to you.  You will
not be taunted if you return and everything that can be done will
be done to make you happy.
<P>
"Indeed, I must implore you to return.  This adventure of yours
has gone on altogether too long; it has become a serious distress
to both your aunt and myself.  We fail altogether to understand
your motives in doing what you are doing, or, indeed, how you are
managing to do it, or what you are managing on.  If you will
think only of one trifling aspect--the inconvenience it must be
to us to explain your absence--I think you may begin to realize
what it all means for us.  I need hardly say that your aunt joins
with me very heartily in this request.
<P>
"Please come home.  You will not find me unreasonable with you.  
<P>
                 "Your affectionate                              
<P>
                             "FATHER."
<P>
<P>
Ann Veronica sat over her fire with her father's note in her
hand.  "Queer letters he writes," she said.  "I suppose most
people's letters are queer.  Roof open--like a Noah's Ark.  I
wonder if he really wants me to go home.  It's odd how little I
know of him, and of how he feels and what he feels."
<P>
"I wonder how he treated Gwen."
<P>
Her mind drifted into a speculation about her sister. "I ought to
look up Gwen," she said.  "I wonder what happened."
<P>
Then she fell to thinking about her aunt.  "I would like to go
home," she cried, "to please her.  She has been a dear. 
Considering how little he lets her have."
<P>
The truth prevailed.  "The unaccountable thing is that I wouldn't
go home to please her.  She is, in her way, a dear.  One OUGHT to
want to please her.  And I don't.  I don't care.  I can't even
make myself care."
<P>
Presently, as if for comparison with her father's letter, she got
out Ramage's check from the box that contained her papers.  For
so far she had kept it uncashed.  She had not even endorsed it.
<P>
"Suppose I chuck it," she remarked, standing with the mauve slip
in her hand--"suppose I chuck it, and surrender and go home! 
Perhaps, after all, Roddy was right!
<P>
"Father keeps opening the door and shutting it, but a time will
come--
<P>
"I could still go home!"
<P>
She held Ramage's check as if to tear it across.  "No," she said
at last; "I'm a human being--not a timid female.  What could I do
at home?  The other's a crumple-up--just surrender.  Funk!  I'll
see it out."
