<p>"Gad&mdash;a troop shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at the
last."</p>

<p>Lewis peered into the gorge and saw only a thin darkness. The
high walls made pits of shade at the foot, but above there was
a misty column of light which showed the spectres of rock and
bush in the nullah beyond. It was all but dark, and the stars
were coming out like the lights on a sea-wall, hard and cold and
gleaming. Just in the throat of the pass a huge boulder had fallen
and left a passage not two yards wide. Beyond there was a sharp
descent of a dozen feet to the gravelled bottom which fell away
in easier stages to the other watershed. Here was a place made
by nature for his plans. With immense pains he rolled the biggest
stones he could move to the passage, so that they were poised
above the slope. He tried the great boulder, too, with his shoulders,
and it seemed to quiver. In the last resort this mass of rock
might be sent crashing down the incline, and by the blessing of
God it should account for its man.</p>

<p>He brought his rifles forward to the stones, loaded them and
felt the cartridges easy in his pocket. They were for the thirty-yards
range; his pistol would be kept for closer quarters. He tried
one after the other, cuddling the stocks to his cheek. They were
all dear-loved weapons, used in deer-stalking at home and on many
a wilder beat. He knew the tricks of each, and he had little pet
devices laughed at by his friends. This one had clattered down
fifty feet of rock in Ross-shire as the scars on the stock bore
witness, and another had his initials burned in the wood, the
relic of a winter's night in a Finnish camp. A thousand old pleasant
memories came back to him, the sights and scents and sounds of
forgotten places, the zest of toil and escapade, the joy of food
and warmth and rest. Well! he had lived, had tasted to the full
the joys of the old earth, the kindly mother of her children.
He had faced death thoughtlessly many times, and now the Ancient
Enemy was on his heels and he was waiting to give him greeting.
A phrase ran in his head, some trophy from his aimless wanderings
among books, which spoke of death coming easily to one "who has
walked steadfastly in the direction of his dreams." It was a comforting
thought to a creature of moods and fancies. He had failed, doubtless,
but he had ever kept some select fanciful aim unforgotten. In
all his weakness he had never betrayed this ultimate Desire of
the Heart.</p>

<p>Some few feet up the cliff was a little thicket of withered thorns.
The air was chilly and the cleft was growing very black. Why should
not he make a fire behind the great boulder? He gathered some
armfuls and heaped them in a space of dry sand. They were a little
wet, so they burned slowly with a great smoke, which the rising
night wind blew behind him. He was still hungry, so he ate the
food he had brought in his pockets; and then he lit his pipe.
How oddly the tobacco tasted in this moment of high excitement!
It was as if the essence of all the pipes he had ever smoked was
concentrated into this last one. The smoke blew back, and as he
sniffed its old homely fragrance he seemed to feel the smell of
peat and heather, of drenched homespun in the snowy bogs, and
the glory of a bright wood fire and the moorland cottage. In a
second his thoughts were many thousand miles away. The night wind
cooled his brow, and he looked into the dark gap and saw his own
past.</p>

<p>The first picture was a cold place on a low western island. Snow
was drifting sparsely, and a dull grey Atlantic swell was grumbling
on the reefs. He was crouching among the withered rushes, where
seaweed and shells had been blown, and snow lay in dirty patches.
He felt the thick collar of his shooting-coat tight about his
neck, while the December evening grew darker and colder. A gillie,
who had no English, was lying at his right hand, and far out at
sea a string of squattering geese were slowly drifting shorewards
with the wind. He saw the scene clear in every line, and he remembered
the moment as if it had been yesterday. It had been one of his
periods of great exultation. He had just left Oxford, and had
fled northward after some weeks in Paris to wash out the taste
of civilization from his mouth among the island north-westers.
He had had a great day among the woodcock, and now was finishing
with a stalk after wild geese. He was furiously hungry, chilled
and soaked to the bone, but riotously happy. His future seemed
to stretch before him, a brighter continuation of a bright past,
a time for high achievement, bold work, and yet no surcease of
pleasure. He had been master of himself in that hour, his body
firm and strong, his soul clear, his mind a tempered weapon awaiting
his hands.</p>

<p>And then the scene changed to a June evening in his own countryside.
He was deep in the very heart of the hills beside a little loch,
whose clear waves lapped on beaches of milky sand, it was just
on twilight, and an infinite sighing of soft winds was around
him, a far-away ineffable brightness of sunset, and the good scents
of dusk among thyme and heather. He had fished all the afternoon,
and his catch lay on the bent beside him. He was to sleep the
night in his plaid, and already a fire of heather-roots behind
him was prepared for supper. He had been for a swim, and his hair
was still wet on his forehead. Just across a conical hill rose
into the golden air, the highest hill in all the countryside,
but here but a little thing, for the loch was as high as many
a hill-top. Just on its face was a scaur, and there a raven&mdash;a
speck&mdash;was wheeling slowly. Among the little islands broods of
mallard were swimming, and trout in a bay were splashing with
wide circles. The whole place had seemed caught up into an ecstasy,
a riot of gold and crimson and far-off haunting shades and scents
and voices. And yet it was no wild spectacle; it was the delicate
comfort of it all which had charmed him. Life seemed one glorious
holiday, the world a garden of the gods. There was his home across
the hills, with its cool chambers, its books and pictures, its
gardens and memories. There were his friends up and down the earth.
There was the earth itself waiting for his conquest. And, meantime,
there was this airy land around him, his own by the earliest form
of occupation.</p>

<p>The fire died down to embers and a sudden scattering of ashes
woke him out of his dreaming. The old Scots land was many thousand
miles away. His past was wiped out behind him. He was alone in
a very strange place, cut off by a great gulf from youth and home
and pleasure. For an instant the extreme loneliness of an exile's
death smote him, but the next second he comforted himself. The
heritage of his land and his people was his in this ultimate moment
a hundredfold more than ever. The sounding tale of his people's
wars&mdash;one against a host, a foray in the mist, a last stand among
the mountain snows&mdash;sang in his heart like a tune. The fierce,
northern exultation, which glories in hardships and the forlorn,
came upon him with such keenness and delight that, as he looked
into the night and the black unknown, he felt the joy of a greater
kinship. He was kin to men lordlier than himself, the true-hearted
who had ridden the King's path and trampled a little world under
foot. To the old fighters in the Border wars, the religionists
of the South, the Highland gentlemen of the Cause, he cried greeting
over the abyss of time. He had lost no inch of his inheritance.
Where, indeed, was the true Scotland? Not in the little barren
acres he had left, the few thousands of city-folk, or the contentions
of unlovely creeds and vain philosophies. The elect of his race
had ever been the wanderers. No more than Hellas had his land
a paltry local unity. Wherever the English flag was planted anew,
wherever men did their duty faithfully and without hope of little
reward&mdash;there was the fatherland of the true patriot.</p>

<p>The time was passing, and still the world was quiet. The hour
must be close on midnight, and still there was no sign of men.
For the first time he dared to hope for success. Before, an hour's
delay was all that he had sought. To give the north time for a
little preparation, to make defence possible, had been his aim;
now with the delay he seemed to see a chance for victory. Bardur
would be alarmed hours ago; men would be on the watch all over
Kashmir and the Punjab; the railways would be guarded. The invader
would find at the least no easy conquest. When they had trodden
his life out in the defile they would find stronger men to bar
their path, and he would not have died in vain. It was a slender
satisfaction for vanity, for what share would he have in the defence?
Unknown, unwept, he would perish utterly, and to others would
be the glory. He did not care, nay, he rejoiced in the brave obscurity.
He had never sought so vulgar a thing as fame. He was going out
of life like a snuffed candle. George, if George survived, would
know nothing of his death. He was miles beyond the frontier, and
if George, after months of war, should make his way to this fatal
cleft, what trace would he find of him? And all his friends, Wratislaw,
Arthur Mordaunt, the folk of Glenavelin&mdash;no word would ever come
to them to tell them of his end.</p>

<p>But Alice&mdash;and in one wave there returned to him the story which
he had striven to put out of his heart. She had known him in his
weakness, but she would never think of him in his strength. The
whimsical fate pleased him. The last meeting on that grey autumn
afternoon at the Broken Bridge had heartened him for his travellings.
It had been a compact between them; and now he was redeeming the
promise of the tryst. And she would never know it, would only
know that somewhere and somehow he had ceased to struggle with
an inborn weakness. Well-a-day! It was no world of rounded corners
and complete achievements. It was enough if a hint, a striving,
a beginning were found in the scheme of man's frailty. He had
no clear-cut conception of a future&mdash;that was the happy lot of
the strong-hearted&mdash;but he had a generous intolerance of little
success. He did not ask rewards, but he prayed for the hope of
a good beginning or a gallant failure. The odd romance which lies
in the wanderer's brain welcomed the paradox. Alice and her bright
hair floated dim on the horizon of his vision, something exquisite
and dear, a memory, a voice, a note of tenderness in this last
exhilaration. A sentimental passion was beyond him; he was too
critical of folly to worship any lost lady; and he had no love
for vain reminiscences. But the girl had become the embodied type
of the past. A year ago he had not seen her, now she was home
and childhood and friends to him. For a moment there was the old
heart-hunger, but the pain had gone. The ineffectual longing which
had galled him had perished at the advent of his new strength.</p>

<p>For in this ultimate moment he at last seemed to have come to
his own. The vulgar little fears, which, like foxes, gnaw at the
roots of the heart, had gone, even the greater perils of faint
hope and a halting energy. The half-hearted had become the stout-hearted.
The resistless vigour of the strong and the simple was his. He
stood in the dark gully peering into the night, his muscles stiff
from heel to neck. The weariness of the day had gone: only the
wound in his ear, got the day before, had begun to bleed afresh.
He wiped the blood away with his handkerchief, and laughed at
the thought of this little care. In a few minutes he would be
facing death, and now he was staunching a pin-prick.</p>

<p>He wondered idly how soon death would come. It would be speedy,
at least, and final. And then the glory of the utter loss. His
bones whitening among the stones, the suns of summer beating on
them and the winter snowdrifts decently covering them with a white
sepulchre. No man could seek a lordlier burial. It was the death
he had always craved. From murder, fire, and sudden death, why
should we call on the Lord to deliver us? A broken neck in a hunting-field,
a slip on rocky mountains, a wounded animal at bay&mdash;such was the
environment of death for which he had ever prayed. But this&mdash;this
was beyond his dreams.</p>

<p>And with it all a great humility fell upon him. His battles were
all unfought. His life had been careless and gay; and the noble
commonplaces of faith and duty had been things of small meaning.
He had lived within the confines of a little aristocracy of birth
and wealth and talent, and the great melancholy world scourged
by the winds of God had seemed to him but a phrase of rhetoric.
His creeds and his arguments seemed meaningless now in this solemn
hour; the truth had been his no more than his crude opponent's!
Had he his days to live over again he would look on the world
with different eyes. No man any more should call him a dreamer.
It pleased him to think that, half-hearted and sceptical as he
had been, a humorist, a laughing philosopher, he was now dying
for one of the catchwords of the crowd. He had returned to the
homely paths of the commonplace, and young, unformed, untried,
he was caught up by kind fate to the place of the wise and the
heroic.</p>

</div>
<p>Suddenly on his thoughts there broke in a dull tread of men,
a sound of slipping stones and feet upon dry gravel. He broke
into the cold sweat of tense nerves, and waited, half hidden,
with his rifle ready. Then came the light of dull lanterns which
showed a thin, endless column beneath the rock walls. They advanced
with wonderful quietness, the sound of feet broken only by a soft
word of command. He calculated the distance&mdash;now it was three
hundred yards, now two, now a bare eighty. At fifty his rifle
flew to his shoulder and he fired. His nerves were bad, for one
bullet clicked on the rock, while the second took the dust a yard
before the enemy's feet. Instantly there was a halt and the sound
of speech.</p>

<p>The failure had steadied him. The second pair of shots killed
their men. He heard the quick cry of pain and shivered. He was
new to this work and the cry hurt him. But he picked up his express
and fired again, and again there was a cry and a fall. Then he
heard a word of command and the sound of men creeping in the side
of the nullah. Eye and ear were marvelously acute at the moment,
for he picked out the scouts and killed them. Then he loaded his
rifles and waited.</p>

<p>He saw a man in the half-light not five yards below him. He fired
and the man dropped, but he had used his rifle and the great spattering
of earth showed his whereabouts. Now was the time for keen eye
and steady arm. The enemy had halted thirty yards off and beneath
the slope there was a patch of darkness. He kept one eye on this,
for it might contain a man. He fixed his attention on a ray of
moonlight which fell across the floor of the gully. When a man
crept past this he shot, and he rarely failed.</p>

<p>Then a command was given and the column came forward at the double.
He fired two shots, but the advance continued. They passed the
ray of light and he saw the whites of their eyes and the gleam
of teeth and steel. They paused a second to fire a volley, and
a storm of shot rattled about him. He had stepped back into his
shelter, and was unscathed, but when he looked out he saw the
enemy at the foot of the slope. His weapons were all loaded except
the express, and in mad haste he sent shot after shot into the
ranks. The fire halted them, and for a second they were on the
edge of a panic. This unknown destruction coming out of the darkness
was terrifying to the stoutest hearts. All the while there was
wrath behind them. This stopping of the advance column was throwing
the whole force into confusion. Angry messages came up from the
centre, and distracted officers cursed their native guides.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lewis was something wholly unlike himself, a maddened
creature with every sense on the alert, drinking in the glory
of the fight. He husbanded the chances of his life with generous
parsimony. Every chance meant some minutes' delay and every delay
a new link of safety for the north. His cartridges were getting
near an end, but there still remained the stones and his pistol
and the power of his arm hand to hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly came a second volley which all but killed him, bullets
glancing on all sides of him and scraping the rocks with a horrid
message of death. Then on the heels of it came a charge up the
slope. The turn had come for the last expedient. He rushed to
the stone and with the strength of madness rooted it from its
foundations. It wavered for a second, and then with a cloud of
earth and gravel it plunged downwards. A second and it had ploughed
its way with a sickening grinding sound into the ranks of the
men below. There was one wild scream of terror, and then a retreat,
a flight, almost a panic.</p>

<p>Down in the hollow was a babel of sound, men yelping with fright,
officers calming and cursing them, and the shouting of the forces
behind. For Lewis the last moment was approaching. The neck of
the pass was now bare and wide and half of the slope was gone.
He had lost his weapons in the fall, all but his express, and
the loosening of the stone had crushed his foot so that he could
scarcely stand. Then order seemed to be restored, for another
volley rang out, which passed over his head as he crouched on
the ground. The enemy were advancing slowly, resolutely. He knew
that now there was something different in their tread.</p>

<p>He was calm and quiet. The mad exhilaration was ebbing and he
was calculating chances as dispassionately as a scientist in his
study. Two shots, the six chambers of his pistol, and then he
would be ground to powder. The moon rode over the top of the cleft
and a sudden wave of light fell on the slope, the writhing dead,
and below, the advancing column. It gave him a chance for fair
shooting, and he did not miss. But the men were maddened with
anger and taunts, and they would have charged a battery. They
came up on the slope with a fierce rush, cursing in gutturals.
He slipped behind the old friendly jag of rock and waited till
they were abreast. Then began a strange pistol practice. Crouching
in the darkness he selected his men and shot them, making no mistake.
The front ranks of the column turned to the right and lunged with
their bayonets into the gloom. But the man knew his purpose. He
climbed farther back till he was above their heads, looking down
on ranks of white inhuman faces mad with slaughter and the courage
which is next door to fear. They were still advancing, but with
an uncertain air. He saw his chance and took it. Crying out he
knew not what, he leapt among them with clutched rifle, striking
madly to right and left. There was a roar of fright, and for a
moment a space was cleared around him. He fought like a maniac,
stumbling with his crushed foot and leaving two men stunned at
his feet. But it was only for a moment. A bayonet entered his
side and his rifle snapped at the stock. He grappled with the
nearest man and pulled him to the ground, for he could stand no
longer. Then there came a wild surge around, a dozen bayonets
pierced him, and in the article of death he was conscious of a
great press which ground him into the earth. The next moment the
column was marching over his body.</p>

<p>Dawn came with light and sweet airs to the dark cleft in the
hills. Just at that moment, when the red east was breaking into
spires and clouds of colour, and the little morning winds were
beginning to flutter among the crags, two men were standing in
the throat of the pass. The ground about them was ploughed up
as if by a battery, the rock seamed and broken, and red stains
of blood were on the dry gravel. From the north, in the direction
of the plain, came the confused sound of an army in camp. But
to the south there was a glimpse through an aperture of hill of
a far side of mountain, and on it a gleam as of fire.</p>

<p>Marka, clad in the uniform of a captain of Cossacks, looked fiercely
at his companion and then at the beacon.</p>

<p>"Look," he said, "look and listen!" And sure enough in the morning
stillness came the sound as of a watchword cried from post to
post.</p>

<p>"That," said he, "is the morning signal of an awakened empire
and the final proof of our failure."</p>

<p>"It was no fault of mine," said Fazir Khan sourly. "I did as
I was commanded, and lo! when I come I find an army in confusion
and the frontier guarded." The chief spoke with composure, but
he had in his heart an uneasy consciousness that he had had some
share in this undoing.</p>

<p>Marka looked down at a body which lay wrinkled across the path.
It was trodden all but shapeless, the poor face was unrecognizable,
the legs were scrawled like a child's letters. Only one hand with
a broken gold signet-ring remained to tell of the poor inmate
of the clay.</p>

<p>The Cossack looked down on the dead with a scowling face. "Curse
him&mdash;curse him eternally. Who would have guessed that this fool,
this phrasing fool, would have spoiled our plans? Curse his conscience
and his honour, and God pity him for a fool! I must return to
my troops, for this is no place to linger in." The man saw his
work of years spoiled in a night, and all by the agency of a single
adventurer. He saw his career blighted, his reputation gone. It
is not to be wondered at if he was bitter.</p>

<p>He turned to go, and in leaving pushed the dead man over with
his foot. He saw the hand and the broken ring.</p>

<p>"This thing was once a gentleman," he said, and he went down
the pass.</p>

<p>But Fazir Khan remained by the body. He remembered his guest
of two days before, and he cursed himself for underrating this
wandering Englishman. He saw himself in evil case. His chances
of spoil and glory had departed. He foresaw expeditions of reprisal,
and the Bada-Mawidi hunted like partridges upon the mountains.
He had staked his all on a desperate chance, and this one man
had been his ruin. For a moment the barbarian came out, and in
a sudden ferocity he kicked the dead.</p>

<p>But as he looked again he was moved to a juster appreciation.</p>

<p>"This thing was a man," he said.</p>

<p>Then stooping he dipped his finger in blood and touched his forehead.
"This man," he said, "was of the race of kings."</p>
