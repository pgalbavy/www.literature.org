<p>Valentine Corliss, having breakfasted in bed at a late hour that
morning, dozed again, roused himself, and, making a toilet, addressed
to the image in his shaving-mirror a disgusted monosyllable.</p>

<p>"Ass!"</p>

<p>However, he had not the look of a man who had played cards all
night to a disastrous tune with an accompaniment in Scotch. His
was a surface not easily indented: he was hard and healthy, clear-skinned
and clear-eyed. When he had made himself point-device, he went
into the "parlour" of his apartment, frowning at the litter of
malodorous, relics, stumps and stubs and bottles and half-drained
glasses, scattered chips and cards, dregs of a night session.
He had been making acquaintances.</p>

<p>He sat at the desk and wrote with a steady hand in Italian:</p>

<p><em>MOST ILLUSTRIOUS MOLITERNO</em>:</p>

<p>We live but learn little. As to myself it appears that I learn
nothing&mdash;nothing! You will at once convey to me by <em>cable</em>
five thousand lire. No; add the difference in exchange so as to
make it one thousand dollars which I shall receive, taking that
sum from the two-hundred and thirty thousand lire which I entrusted
to your safekeeping by cable as the result of my enterprise in
this place. I should have returned at once, content with that
success, but as you know I am a very stupid fellow, never pleased
with a moderate triumph, nor with a large one, when there is a
possible prospect of greater. I am compelled to believe that the
greater I had in mind in this case was an illusion: my gentle
diplomacy avails nothing against a small miser&mdash;for we have misers
even in these States, though you will not believe it. I abandon
him to his riches! From the success of my venture I reserved four
thousand dollars to keep by me and for my expenses, and it is
humiliating to relate that all of this, except a small banknote
or two, was taken from me last night by amateurs. I should keep
away from cards&mdash;they hate me, and alone I can do nothing with
them. Some young gentlemen of the place, whose acquaintance I
had made at a ball, did me the honour of this lesson at the native
game of poker, at which <em>I&mdash;</em>though also native&mdash;am not
even so expert as yourself, and, as you will admit, Antonio, my
friend, you are not a good player&mdash;when observed. Unaided, I was
a child in their hands. It was also a painful rule that one paid
for the counters upon delivery. This made me ill, but I carried
it off with an air of carelessness creditable to an adopted Neapolitan.
Upon receipt of the money you are to cable me, I shall leave this
town and sail immediately. Come to Paris, and meet me there at
the place on the Rue Auber within ten days from your reading this
letter. You will have, remaining, two hundred and twenty-five
thousand francs, which it will be safer to bring in cash, and
I will deal well with you, as is our custom with each other. You
have done excellently throughout; your cables and letters for
exhibition concerning those famous oil wells have been perfection;
and I shall of course not deduct what was taken by these thieves
of poker players from the sum of profits upon which we shall estimate
your commission. I have several times had the feeling that the
hour for departure had arrived; now I shall delay not a moment
after receiving your cable, though I may occupy the interim with
a last attempt to interest my small miser. Various circumstances
cause me some uneasiness, though I do not believe I could be successfully
assailed by the law in the matter of oil. You do own an estate
in Basilicata, at least your brother does&mdash;these good people here
would not be apt to discover the difference&mdash;and the rest is a
matter of plausibility. The odious coincidence of encountering
the old cow, Pryor, fretted me somewhat (though he has not repeated
his annoying call), and I have other small apprehensions&mdash;for
example, that it may not improve my credit if my loss of last
night becomes gossip, though the thieves professed strong habits
of discretion. My little affair of gallantry grows embarrassing.
Such affairs are so easy to inaugurate; extrication is more difficult.
However, without it I should have failed to interest my investor
and there is always the charm. Your last letter is too curious
in that matter. Licentious man, one does not write of these things
while under the banner of the illustrious Uncle Sam &mdash;I am
assuming the American attitude while here, or perhaps my early
youth returns to me&mdash;a thing very different from your own boyhood,
Don Antonio. Nevertheless, I promise you some laughter in the
Rue Auber. Though you will not be able to understand the half
of what I shall tell you&mdash;particularly the portraits I shall sketch
of my defeated rivals&mdash;your spirit shall roll with laughter.</p>

<p>To the bank, then, the instant you read. Cable me one thousand
dollars, and be at the Rue Auber not more than ten days later.
To the bank! Thence to the telegraph office. Speed! V. C.</p>

<p>He was in better spirits as he read over this letter, and he
chuckled as he addressed it. He pictured himself in the rear room
of the bar in the Rue Auber, relating, across the little marble-topped
table, this American adventure, to the delight of that blithe,
ne'er-do-well outcast of an exalted poor family, that gambler,
blackmailer and merry rogue, Don Antonio Moliterno, comrade and
teacher of this ductile Valentine since the later days of adolescence.
They had been school-fellows in Rome, and later roamed Europe
together unleashed, discovering worlds of many kinds. Valentine's
careless mother let her boy go as he liked, and was often negligent
in the matter of remittances: he and his friend learned ways to
raise the wind, becoming expert and making curious affiliations.
At her death there was a small inheritance; she had not been provident.
The little she left went rocketing, and there was the wind to
be raised again: young Corliss had wits and had found that they
could supply him&mdash;most of the time&mdash;with much more than the necessities
of life. He had also found that he possessed a strong attraction
for various women; already&mdash;at twenty-two&mdash;his experience was
considerable, and, in his way, he became a specialist. He had
a talent; he improved it and his opportunities. Altogether, he
took to the work without malice and with a light heart. . . .</p>

<p>He sealed the envelope, rang for a boy, gave him the letter to
post, and directed that the apartment should be set to rights.
It was not that in which he had received Ray Vilas. Corliss had
moved to rooms on another floor of the hotel, the day after that
eccentric and somewhat ominous person had called to make an "investment."
Ray's shadowy forebodings concerning that former apartment had
encountered satire: Corliss was a "materialist" and, at the mildest
estimate, an unusually practical man, but he would never sleep
in a bed with its foot toward the door; southern Italy had seeped
into him. He changed his rooms, a measure of which Don Antonio
Moliterno would have wholly approved. Besides, these were as comfortable
as the others, and so like them as even to confirm Ray's statement
concerning "A Reading from Homer": evidently this work had been
purchased by the edition.</p>

<p>A boy came to announce that his "roadster" waited for him at
the hotel entrance, and Corliss put on a fur motoring coat and
cap, and went downstairs. A door leading from the hotel bar into
the lobby was open, and, as Corliss passed it, there issued a
mocking shout:</p>

<p>"Tor'dor! Oh, look at the Tor'dor! Ain't he the handsome Spaniard!"</p>

<p>Ray Vilas stumbled out, tousled, haggard, waving his arms in
absurd and meaningless gestures; an amused gallery of tipplers
filling the doorway behind him.</p>

<p>"Goin' take Carmen buggy ride in the country, ain't he? Good
ole Tor'dor!" he quavered loudly, clutching Corliss's shoulder.
"How much you s'pose he pays f' that buzz-buggy by the day, jeli'm'n?
Naughty Tor'dor, stole thousand dollars from me&mdash;makin' presents&mdash;diamond
cresses. Tor'dor, I hear you been playing cards. Tha's sn't nice.
Tor'dor, you're not a goo' boy at all&mdash;<em>you</em> know you oughtn't
waste Dick Lindley's money like that!"</p>

<p>Corliss set his open hand upon the drunkard's breast and sent
him gyrating and plunging backward. Some one caught the grotesque
figure as it fell.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God," screamed Ray, "I haven't got a gun on me! He <em>knows</em>
I haven't got my gun with me! <em>Why</em> haven't I got my gun
with me?"</p>

<p>They hustled him away, and Corliss, enraged and startled, passed
on. As he sped the car up Corliss Street, he decided to anticipate
his letter to Moliterno by a cable. He had stayed too long.</p>

<p>Cora looked charming in a new equipment for November motoring;
yet it cannot be said that either of them enjoyed the drive. They
lunched a dozen miles out from the city at an establishment somewhat
in the nature of a roadside inn; and, although its cuisine was
quite unknown to Cora's friend, Mrs. Villard (an eager amateur
of the table), they were served with a meal of such unusual excellence
that the waiter thought it a thousand pities patrons so distinguished
should possess such poor appetites.</p>

<p>They returned at about three in the afternoon, and Cora descended
from the car wearing no very amiable expression.</p>

<p>"Why won't you come in now?" she asked, looking at him angrily.
"We've got to talk things out. We've settled nothing whatever.
I want to know why you can't stop."</p>

<p>"I've got some matters to attend to, and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What matters?" She shot him a glance of fierce skepticism.</p>

<p>"Are you packing to get out?"</p>

<p>"Cora!" he cried reproachfully, "how can you say things like
that to <em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Oh, it wouldn't surprise me in the least!
How do <em>I</em> know what you'll do? For all I know, you may
be just that kind of a man. You <em>said</em> you ought to be
going&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Cora," he explained, gently, "I didn't say I meant to go. I
said only that I thought I ought to, because Moliterno will be
needing me in Basilicata. I ought to be there, since it appears
that no more money is to be raised here. I ought to be superintending
operations in the oil-field, so as to make the best use of the
little I have raised."</p>

<p>"You?" she laughed. "Of course <em>I</em> didn't have anything
to do with it!"</p>

<p>He sighed deeply. "You know perfectly well that I appreciate
all you did. We don't seem to get on very well to-day&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No!" She laughed again, bitterly. "So you think you'll be going,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"To my rooms to write some necessary letters."</p>

<p>"Of course not to pack your trunk?"</p>

<p>"Cora," he returned, goaded; "sometimes you're just impossible.
I'll come to-morrow forenoon."</p>

<p>"Then don't bring the car. I'm tired of motoring and tired of
lunching in that rotten hole. We can talk just as well in the
library. Papa's better, and that little fiend will be in school
to-morrow. Come out about ten."</p>

<p>He started the machine. "Don't forget I love you," he called
in a low voice.</p>

<p>She stood looking after him as the car dwindled down the street.</p>

<p>"Yes, you do!" she murmured.</p>

<p>She walked up the path to the house, her face thoughtful, as
with a tiresome perplexity. In her own room, divesting herself
of her wraps, she gave the mirror a long scrutiny. It offered
the picture of a girl with a hard and dreary air; but Cora saw
something else, and presently, though the dreariness remained,
the hardness softened to a great compassion. She suffered: a warm
wave of sorrow submerged her, and she threw herself upon the bed
and wept long and silently for herself.</p>

<p>At last her eyes dried, and she lay staring at the ceiling. The
doorbell rang, and Sarah, the cook, came to inform her that Mr.
Richard Lindley was below.</p>

<p>"Tell him I'm out."</p>

<p>"Can't," returned Sarah. "Done told him you was home." And she
departed firmly.</p>

<p>Thus abandoned, the prostrate lady put into a few words what
she felt about Sarah, and, going to the door, whisperingly summoned
in Laura, who was leaving the sick-room, across the hall.</p>

<p>"Richard is downstairs. Will you go and tell him I'm sick in
bed&mdash;or dead? Anything to make him go." And, assuming Laura's
acquiescence, Cora went on, without pause: "Is father worse? What's
the matter with you, Laura?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. He's a little better, Miss Peirce thinks."</p>

<p>"You look ill."</p>

<p>"I'm all right."</p>

<p>"Then run along like a duck and get rid of that old bore for
me."</p>

<p>"Cora&mdash;please see him?"</p>

<p>"Not me! I've got too much to think about to bother with him."</p>

<p>Laura walked to the window and stood with her back to her sister,
apparently interested in the view of Corliss Street there presented.
"Cora," she said, "why don't you marry him and have done with
all this?"</p>

<p>Cora hooted.</p>

<p>"Why not? Why not marry him as soon as you can get ready? Why
don't you go down now and tell him you will? Why not, Cora?"</p>

<p>"I'd as soon marry a pail of milk&mdash;yes, tepid milk, skimmed!
I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't you realize how kind he'd be to you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Cora moodily. "He might object
to some things&mdash;but it doesn't matter, because I'm not going to
try him. I don't mind a man's being a fool, but I can't stand
the absent-minded breed of idiot. I've worn his diamond in the
pendant right in his eyes for weeks; he's never once noticed it
enough even to ask me about the pendant, but bores me to death
wanting to know why I won't wear the ring! Anyhow, what's the
use talking about him? He couldn't marry me right now, even if
I wanted him to&mdash;not till he begins to get something on the investment
he made with Val. Outside of that, he's got nothing except his
rooms at his mother's; she hasn't much either; and if Richard
should lose what he put in with Val, he couldn't marry for years,
probably. That's what made him so obstinate about it. No; if I
ever marry right off the reel it's got to be somebody with&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Cora" &mdash;Laura still spoke from the window, not turning&mdash;"aren't
you tired of it all, of this getting so upset about one man and
then another and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Tired</em>!" Cora uttered the word in a repressed fury of
emphasis. "I'm sick of <em>everything</em>! I don't care for anything
or anybody on this earth&mdash;except&mdash;except you and mamma. I thought
I was going to love Val. I thought I <em>did</em>&mdash;but oh, my
Lord, I don't! I don't think I <em>can</em> care any more. Or
else there isn't any such thing as love. How can anybody tell
whether there is or not? You get kind of crazy over a man and
want to go the limit&mdash;or marry him perhaps&mdash;or sometimes you just
want to make him crazy about you&mdash;and then you get over it&mdash;and
what is there left but hell!" She choked with a sour laugh. "Ugh!
For heaven's sake, Laura, don't make me talk. Everything's gone
to the devil and I've got to think. The best thing you can do
is to go down and get rid of Richard for me. I <em>can't</em>
see him!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Laura, and went to the door.</p>

<p>"You're a darling," whispered Cora, kissing her quickly. "Tell
him I'm in a raging headache&mdash;make him think I wanted to see him,
but you wouldn't let me, because I'm too ill." She laughed. "Give
me a little time, old dear: I may decide to take him yet!"</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Madison who informed the waiting Richard that Cora
was unable to see him, because she was "lying down"; and the young
man, after properly inquiring about Mr. Madison, went blankly
forth.</p>

<p>Hedrick was stalking the front yard, mounted at a great height
upon a pair of stilts. He joined the departing visitor upon the
sidewalk and honoured him with his company, proceeding storkishly
beside him.</p>

<p>"Been to see Cora?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Hedrick."</p>

<p>"What'd you want to see her about?" asked the frank youth seriously.</p>

<p>Richard was able to smile. "Nothing in particular, Hedrick."</p>

<p>"You didn't come to tell her about something?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever, my dear sir. I wished merely the honour of
seeing her and chatting with her upon indifferent subjects."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Did you see her?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm sorry to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"She's home, all right," Hedrick took pleasure in informing him.</p>

<p>"Yes. She was lying down and I told your mother not to disturb
her."</p>

<p>"Worn out with too much automobile riding, I expect," Hedrick
sniffed. "She goes out about every day with this Corliss in his
hired roadster."</p>

<p>They walked on in silence. Not far from Mrs. Lindley's, Hedrick
abruptly became vocal in an artificial laugh. Richard was obviously
intended to inquire into its cause, but, as he did not, Hedrick,
after laughing hollowly for some time, volunteered the explanation:</p>

<p>"I played a pretty good trick on you last night."</p>

<p>"Odd I didn't know it."</p>

<p>"That's why it was good. You'd never guess it in the world."</p>

<p>"No, I believe I shouldn't. You see what makes it so hard, Hedrick,
is that I can't even remember seeing you, last night."</p>

<p>"Nobody saw me. Somebody heard me though, all right."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The nigger that works at your mother's &mdash;Joe."</p>

<p>"What about it? Were you teasing Joe?"</p>

<p>"No, it was you I was after."</p>

<p>"Well? Did you get me?"</p>

<p>Hedrick made another somewhat ghastly pretence of mirth. "Well,
I guess I've had about all the fun out of it I'm going to. Might
as well tell you. It was that book of Laura's you thought she
sent you."</p>

<p>Richard stopped short; whereupon Hedrick turned clumsily, and
began to stalk back in the direction from which they had come.</p>

<p>"That book &mdash;I thought she&mdash;sent me?" Lindley repeated,
stammering.</p>

<p>"She never sent it," called the boy, continuing to walk away.
"She kept it hid, and I found it. I faked her into writing your
name on a sheet of paper, and made you think she'd sent the old
thing to you. I just did it for a joke on you."</p>

<p>With too retching an effort to simulate another burst of merriment,
he caught the stump of his right stilt in a pavement crack, wavered,
cut in the air a figure like a geometrical proposition gone mad,
and came whacking to earth in magnificent disaster.</p>

<p>Richard took him to Mrs. Lindley for repairs. She kept him until
dark: Hedrick was bandaged, led, lemonaded and blandished.</p>

<p>Never in his life had he known such a listener.</p>
