<p>WHEN Ottenburg and his host reached the house on Colfax Avenue, they
went directly to the library, a long double room on the second floor
which Archie had arranged exactly to his own taste. It was full of books
and mounted specimens of wild game, with a big writing-table at either
end, stiff, old-fashioned engravings, heavy hangings and deep
upholstery.
</p><p>When one of the Japanese boys brought the cocktails, Fred turned from
the fine specimen of peccoray he had been examining and said, “A man is
an owl to live in such a place alone, Archie. Why don't you marry? As
for me, just because I can't marry, I find the world full of charming,
unattached women, any one of whom I could fit up a house for with
alacrity.”
</p><p>“You're more knowing than I.” Archie spoke politely. “I'm not very wide
awake about women. I'd be likely to pick out one of the uncomfortable
ones--and there are a few of them, you know.” He drank his cocktail and
rubbed his hands together in a friendly way. “My friends here have
charming wives, and they don't give me a chance to get lonely. They are
very kind to me, and I have a great many pleasant friendships.”
</p><p>Fred put down his glass. “Yes, I've always noticed that women have
confidence in you. You have the doctor's way of getting next. And you
enjoy that kind of thing?”
</p><p>“The friendship of attractive women? Oh, dear, yes! I depend upon it a
great deal.”
</p><p>The butler announced dinner, and the two men went downstairs to the
dining-room. Dr. Archie's dinners were always good and well served, and
his wines were excellent.
</p><p>“I saw the Fuel and Iron people to-day,” Ottenburg said, looking up from
his soup. “Their heart is in the right place. I can't see why in the
mischief you ever got mixed up with that reform gang, Archie. You've got
nothing to reform out here. The situation has always been as simple as
two and two in Colorado; mostly a matter of a friendly understanding.”
</p><p>“Well,”--Archie spoke tolerantly,--“some of the young fellows seemed to
have red-hot convictions, and I thought it was better to let them try
their ideas out.”
</p><p>Ottenburg shrugged his shoulders. “A few dull young men who haven't
ability enough to play the old game the old way, so they want to put on
a new game which doesn't take so much brains and gives away more
advertising that's what your anti-saloon league and vice commission
amounts to. They provide notoriety for the fellows who can't distinguish
themselves at running a business or practicing law or developing an
industry. Here you have a mediocre lawyer with no brains and no
practice, trying to get a look-in on something. He comes up with the
novel proposition that the prostitute has a hard time of it, puts his
picture in the paper, and the first thing you know, he's a celebrity. He
gets the rake-off and she's just where she was before. How could you
fall for a mouse-trap like Pink Alden, Archie?”
</p><p>Dr. Archie laughed as he began to carve. “Pink seems to get under your
skin. He's not worth talking about. He's gone his limit. People won't
read about his blameless life any more. I knew those interviews he gave
out would cook him. They were a last resort. I could have stopped him,
but by that time I'd come to the conclusion that I'd let the reformers
down. I'm not against a general shaking-up, but the trouble with Pinky's
crowd is they never get beyond a general writing-up. We gave them a
chance to do something, and they just kept on writing about each other
and what temptations they had overcome.”
</p><p>While Archie and his friend were busy with Colorado politics, the
impeccable Japanese attended swiftly and intelligently to his duties,
and the dinner, as Ottenburg at last remarked, was worthy of more
profitable conversation.
</p><p>“So it is,” the doctor admitted. “Well, we'll go upstairs for our coffee
and cut this out. Bring up some cognac and arak, Tai,” he added as he
rose from the table.
</p><p>They stopped to examine a moose's head on the stairway, and when they
reached the library the pine logs in the fireplace had been lighted, and
the coffee was bubbling before the hearth. Tai placed two chairs before
the fire and brought a tray of cigarettes.
</p><p>“Bring the cigars in my lower desk drawer, boy,” the doctor directed.
“Too much light in here, isn't there, Fred? Light the lamp there on my
desk, Tai.” He turned off the electric glare and settled himself deep
into the chair opposite Ottenburg's.
</p><p>“To go back to our conversation, doctor,” Fred began while he waited for
the first steam to blow off his coffee; “why don't you make up your mind
to go to Washington? There'd be no fight made against you. I needn't say
the United Breweries would back you. There'd be some KUDOS coming to us,
too; backing a reform candidate.”
</p><p>Dr. Archie measured his length in his chair and thrust his large boots
toward the crackling pitch-pine. He drank his coffee and lit a big black
cigar while his guest looked over the assortment of cigarettes on the
tray. “You say why don't I,” the doctor spoke with the deliberation of a
man in the position of having several courses to choose from, “but, on
the other hand, why should I?” He puffed away and seemed, through his
half-closed eyes, to look down several long roads with the intention of
luxuriously rejecting all of them and remaining where he was. “I'm sick
of politics. I'm disillusioned about serving my crowd, and I don't
particularly want to serve yours. Nothing in it that I particularly
want; and a man's not effective in politics unless he wants something
for himself, and wants it hard. I can reach my ends by straighter roads.
There are plenty of things to keep me busy. We haven't begun to develop
our resources in this State; we haven't had a look in on them yet.
That's the only thing that isn't fake--making men and machines go, and
actually turning out a product.”
</p><p>The doctor poured himself some white cordial and looked over the little
glass into the fire with an expression which led Ottenburg to believe
that he was getting at something in his own mind. Fred lit a cigarette
and let his friend grope for his idea.
</p><p>“My boys, here,” Archie went on, “have got me rather interested in
Japan. Think I'll go out there in the spring, and come back the other
way, through Siberia. I've always wanted to go to Russia.” His eyes
still hunted for something in his big fireplace. With a slow turn of his
head he brought them back to his guest and fixed them upon him. “Just
now, I'm thinking of running on to New York for a few weeks,” he ended
abruptly.
</p><p>Ottenburg lifted his chin. “Ah!” he exclaimed, as if he began to see
Archie's drift. “Shall you see Thea?”
</p><p>“Yes.” The doctor replenished his cordial glass. “In fact, I suspect I
am going exactly TO see her. I'm getting stale on things here, Fred.
Best people in the world and always doing things for me. I'm fond of
them, too, but I've been with them too much. I'm getting ill-tempered,
and the first thing I know I'll be hurting people's feelings. I snapped
Mrs. Dandridge up over the telephone this afternoon when she asked me to
go out to Colorado Springs on Sunday to meet some English people who are
staying at the Antlers. Very nice of her to want me, and I was as sour
as if she'd been trying to work me for something. I've got to get out
for a while, to save my reputation.”
</p><p>To this explanation Ottenburg had not paid much attention. He seemed to
be looking at a fixed point: the yellow glass eyes of a fine wildcat
over one of the bookcases. “You've never heard her at all, have you?” he
asked reflectively. “Curious, when this is her second season in New
York.”
</p><p>“I was going on last March. Had everything arranged. And then old Cap
Harris thought he could drive his car and me through a lamp-post and I
was laid up with a compound fracture for two months. So I didn't get to
see Thea.”
</p><p>Ottenburg studied the red end of his cigarette attentively. “She might
have come out to see you. I remember you covered the distance like a
streak when she wanted you.”
</p><p>Archie moved uneasily. “Oh, she couldn't do that. She had to get back to
Vienna to work on some new parts for this year. She sailed two days
after the New York season closed.”
</p><p>“Well, then she couldn't, of course.” Fred smoked his cigarette close
and tossed the end into the fire. “I'm tremendously glad you're going
now. If you're stale, she'll jack you up. That's one of her specialties.
She got a rise out of me last December that lasted me all winter.”
</p><p>“Of course,” the doctor apologized, “you know so much more about such
things. I'm afraid it will be rather wasted on me. I'm no judge of
music.”
</p><p>“Never mind that.” The younger man pulled himself up in his chair. “She
gets it across to people who aren't judges. That's just what she does.”
 He relapsed into his former lassitude. “If you were stone deaf, it
wouldn't all be wasted. It's a great deal to watch her. Incidentally,
you know, she is very beautiful. Photographs give you no idea.”
</p><p>Dr. Archie clasped his large hands under his chin. “Oh, I'm counting on
that. I don't suppose her voice will sound natural to me. Probably I
wouldn't know it.”
</p><p>Ottenburg smiled. “You'll know it, if you ever knew it. It's the same
voice, only more so. You'll know it.”
</p><p>“Did you, in Germany that time, when you wrote me? Seven years ago, now.
That must have been at the very beginning.”
</p><p>“Yes, somewhere near the beginning. She sang one of the Rhine
daughters.” Fred paused and drew himself up again. “Sure, I knew it from
the first note. I'd heard a good many young voices come up out of the
Rhine, but, by gracious, I hadn't heard one like that!” He fumbled for
another cigarette. “Mahler was conducting that night. I met him as he
was leaving the house and had a word with him. 'Interesting voice you
tried out this evening,' I said. He stopped and smiled. 'Miss Kronborg,
you mean? Yes, very. She seems to sing for the idea. Unusual in a young
singer.' I'd never heard him admit before that a singer could have an
idea. She not only had it, but she got it across. The Rhine music, that
I'd known since I was a boy, was fresh to me, vocalized for the first
time. You realized that she was beginning that long story, adequately,
with the end in view. Every phrase she sang was basic. She simply WAS
the idea of the Rhine music.” Ottenburg rose and stood with his back to
the fire. “And at the end, where you don't see the maidens at all, the
same thing again: two pretty voices AND the Rhine voice.” Fred snapped
his fingers and dropped his hand.
</p><p>The doctor looked up at him enviously. “You see, all that would be lost
on me,” he said modestly. “I don't know the dream nor the interpretation
thereof. I'm out of it. It's too bad that so few of her old friends can
appreciate her.”
</p><p>“Take a try at it,” Fred encouraged him. “You'll get in deeper than you
can explain to yourself. People with no personal interest do that.”
</p><p>“I suppose,” said Archie diffidently, “that college German, gone to
seed, wouldn't help me out much. I used to be able to make my German
patients understand me.”
</p><p>“Sure it would!” cried Ottenburg heartily. “Don't be above knowing your
libretto. That's all very well for musicians, but common mortals like
you and me have got to know what she's singing about. Get out your
dictionary and go at it as you would at any other proposition. Her
diction is beautiful, and if you know the text you'll get a great deal.
So long as you're going to hear her, get all that's coming to you. You
bet in Germany people know their librettos by heart! You Americans are
so afraid of stooping to learn anything.”
</p><p>“I AM a little ashamed,” Archie admitted. “I guess that's the way we
mask our general ignorance. However, I'll stoop this time; I'm more
ashamed not to be able to follow her. The papers always say she's such a
fine actress.” He took up the tongs and began to rearrange the logs that
had burned through and fallen apart. “I suppose she has changed a great
deal?” he asked absently.
</p><p>“We've all changed, my dear Archie,--she more than most of us. Yes, and
no. She's all there, only there's a great deal more of her. I've had
only a few words with her in several years. It's better not, when I'm
tied up this way. The laws are barbarous, Archie.”
</p><p>“Your wife is--still the same?” the doctor asked sympathetically.
</p><p>“Absolutely. Hasn't been out of a sanitarium for seven years now. No
prospect of her ever being out, and as long as she's there I'm tied hand
and foot. What does society get out of such a state of things, I'd like
to know, except a tangle of irregularities? If you want to reform,
there's an opening for you!”
</p><p>“It's bad, oh, very bad; I agree with you!” Dr. Archie shook his head.
“But there would be complications under another system, too. The whole
question of a young man's marrying has looked pretty grave to me for a
long while. How have they the courage to keep on doing it? It depresses
me now to buy wedding presents.” For some time the doctor watched his
guest, who was sunk in bitter reflections. “Such things used to go
better than they do now, I believe. Seems to me all the married people I
knew when I was a boy were happy enough.” He paused again and bit the
end off a fresh cigar. “You never saw Thea's mother, did you, Ottenburg?
That's a pity. Mrs. Kronborg was a fine woman. I've always been afraid
Thea made a mistake, not coming home when Mrs. Kronborg was ill, no
matter what it cost her.”
</p><p>Ottenburg moved about restlessly. “She couldn't, Archie, she positively
couldn't. I felt you never understood that, but I was in Dresden at the
time, and though I wasn't seeing much of her, I could size up the
situation for myself. It was by just a lucky chance that she got to sing
ELIZABETH that time at the Dresden Opera, a complication of
circumstances. If she'd run away, for any reason, she might have waited
years for such a chance to come again. She gave a wonderful performance
and made a great impression. They offered her certain terms; she had to
take them and follow it up then and there. In that game you can't lose a
single trick. She was ill herself, but she sang. Her mother was ill, and
she sang. No, you mustn't hold that against her, Archie. She did the
right thing there.” Ottenburg drew out his watch. “Hello! I must be
traveling. You hear from her regularly?”
</p><p>“More or less regularly. She was never much of a letter-writer. She tells
me about her engagements and contracts, but I know so little about that
business that it doesn't mean much to me beyond the figures, which seem
very impressive. We've had a good deal of business correspondence, about
putting up a stone to her father and mother, and, lately, about her
youngest brother, Thor. He is with me now; he drives my car. To-day he's
up at the mine.”
</p><p>Ottenburg, who had picked up his overcoat, dropped it. “Drives your
car?” he asked incredulously.
</p><p>“Yes. Thea and I have had a good deal of bother about Thor. We tried a
business college, and an engineering school, but it was no good. Thor
was born a chauffeur before there were cars to drive. He was never good
for anything else; lay around home and collected postage stamps and took
bicycles to pieces, waiting for the automobile to be invented. He's just
as much a part of a car as the steering-gear. I can't find out whether
he likes his job with me or not, or whether he feels any curiosity about
his sister. You can't find anything out from a Kronborg nowadays. The
mother was different.”
</p><p>Fred plunged into his coat. “Well, it's a queer world, Archie. But
you'll think better of it, if you go to New York. Wish I were going with
you. I'll drop in on you in the morning at about eleven. I want a word
with you about this Interstate Commerce Bill. Good-night.”
</p><p>Dr. Archie saw his guest to the motor which was waiting below, and then
went back to his library, where he replenished the fire and sat down for
a long smoke. A man of Archie's modest and rather credulous nature
develops late, and makes his largest gain between forty and fifty. At
thirty, indeed, as we have seen, Archie was a soft-hearted boy under a
manly exterior, still whistling to keep up his courage. Prosperity and
large responsibilities--above all, getting free of poor Mrs. Archie--had
brought out a good deal more than he knew was in him. He was thinking
tonight as he sat before the fire, in the comfort he liked so well, that
but for lucky chances, and lucky holes in the ground, he would still be
a country practitioner, reading his old books by his office lamp. And
yet, he was not so fresh and energetic as he ought to be. He was tired
of business and of politics. Worse than that, he was tired of the men
with whom he had to do and of the women who, as he said, had been kind
to him. He felt as if he were still hunting for something, like old
Jasper Flight. He knew that this was an unbecoming and ungrateful state
of mind, and he reproached himself for it. But he could not help
wondering why it was that life, even when it gave so much, after all
gave so little. What was it that he had expected and missed? Why was he,
more than he was anything else, disappointed?
</p><p>He fell to looking back over his life and asking himself which years of
it he would like to live over again,--just as they had been,--and they
were not many. His college years he would live again, gladly. After them
there was nothing he would care to repeat until he came to Thea
Kronborg. There had been something stirring about those years in
Moonstone, when he was a restless young man on the verge of breaking
into larger enterprises, and when she was a restless child on the verge
of growing up into something unknown. He realized now that she had
counted for a great deal more to him than he knew at the time. It was a
continuous sort of relationship. He was always on the lookout for her as
he went about the town, always vaguely expecting her as he sat in his
office at night. He had never asked himself then if it was strange that
he should find a child of twelve the most interesting and companionable
person in Moonstone. It had seemed a pleasant, natural kind of
solicitude. He explained it then by the fact that he had no children of
his own. But now, as he looked back at those years, the other interests
were faded and inanimate. The thought of them was heavy. But wherever
his life had touched Thea Kronborg's, there was still a little warmth
left, a little sparkle. Their friendship seemed to run over those
discontented years like a leafy pattern, still bright and fresh when the
other patterns had faded into the dull background. Their walks and
drives and confidences, the night they watched the rabbit in the
moonlight,--why were these things stirring to remember? Whenever he
thought of them, they were distinctly different from the other memories
of his life; always seemed humorous, gay, with a little thrill of
anticipation and mystery about them. They came nearer to being tender
secrets than any others he possessed. Nearer than anything else they
corresponded to what he had hoped to find in the world, and had not
found. It came over him now that the unexpected favors of fortune, no
matter how dazzling, do not mean very much to us. They may excite or
divert us for a time, but when we look back, the only things we cherish
are those which in some way met our original want; the desire which
formed in us in early youth, undirected, and of its own accord.
