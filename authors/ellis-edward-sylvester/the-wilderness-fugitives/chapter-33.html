<p>The capture of Clinton by the six Iroquois was done as artistically
as if the whole thing were a play in which all had studied and
rehearsed their parts. The youth had not the least suspicion of
the peril, until he saw the hand suddenly extended and the rifle
withdrawn at the same moment he leaned it against the tree trunk.
Then, before he was able to form an idea of what it meant, the
Indians came out, he was surrounded and all escape cut off. His
gun was beyond his reach, and, wherever he turned, he was confronted
by a painted and fully armed Indian warrior.</p>

<p>Ned was confident that these were the same ones he had seen under
the command of Captain Bagley, and he looked around for that officer.
But he was not to be seen. It was a small matter, however, whether
they were the same redmen or not. It was not to be expected that
there was any perceptible difference between the Iroquois&mdash;let
them come from whatever part of the country they chose.</p>

<p>The warriors seemed to enjoy the consternation depicted on the
face of their prisoner, who was speechless for a minute or so.
But Ned was brave, and there was no shrinking when he was called
upon to face one of the possibilities of the warfare in which
he was engaged. The first really strong emotion of which he was
sensible was that of astonishment, as he recalled the events of
the past few days, during which he had met with so many narrow
escapes, both from death and capture. Now he had fallen a victim
just like a lamb when driven into a corner by the slayer. The
next matter which agitated him was the question whether the Iroquois
would kill him then and there, or whether they meant to preserve
him for future punishment and torture. It must have been that
they had received instructions from higher authorities that the
whites, whenever possible, were to be taken prisoners instead
of being shot, for they made no demonstration toward the fugitive
in their power.</p>

<p>After the first feeling of amazement passed, and the captors
and captured seemed to understand the situation more fully, the
Iroquois stood for several minutes in a conversation which seemed
to Ned to consist mainly of exclamations and gestures. He concluded
they were discussing what was best to do with him. As he was unable
to catch the meaning of a single word uttered, he busied himself
in trying to read their sentiments through the gestures in which
they indulged. This was a hard task, for they were not of a character
natural and expressive to him. But when the thing had lasted some
time, he caught the name of Lena-Wingo pronounced by one of them.
This led the youth to suspect they were discussing some other
question, having determined what was to be done with him long
before.</p>

<p>It might be that the warriors were arguing the question whether
they should attempt to reach the cavern, seeing that they had
secured one of the fugitives, who could conduct them direct to
the spot. But, in case such was their intention, Ned was resolved
that he would die before playing the part of guide and thus be
the means of delivering Rosa into the hands of Colonel Butler.
If they addressed him, even, in broken English, he could feign
an ignorance of what they said; and, if it should prove impossible
to carry out that artifice, he would simply refuse to lead them,
and they could do their worst. Fortunately, however, he was not
subjected to the trial. The conversation lasted but a short time,
when the Indians seemed to conclude it wise for them to leave
the immediate neighborhood, for Lena-Wingo was abroad, and there
was no telling when or where he would strike, nor in what manner
he would call on them.</p>

<p>"I suppose they're on their way to camp," thought Ned, following
as obediently as a child, "and I am likely to meet the great Colonel
Butler. I know what he thinks of me, and he won't be apt to adopt
me as a brother."</p>

<p>The mind of the young man was very active, and he indulged in
all kinds of speculation as he moved toward his unknown destination.
He was well aware that the Tory commander held him in especial
hatred, for the reason that he knew that he loved Rosa Minturn,
and suspected that she loved him in return. Surrounded by such
heartless allies as were the Iroquois, a cruel man like the Tory
could readily find the means of doing what he willed in the way
of punishing a rival in the affections of a lady. After indulging
in these reflections until he wearied, the prisoner found himself
wondering as to how long it would be before the Mohawk would find
out what had befallen his young friend.</p>

<p>"I think he will conclude to give me up," muttered Ned, "for
whenever he goes off to look after the interests of Rosa, he comes
back and finds the rest of us have gotten into trouble. It would
have been a great deal better if he had left Jo and me at home,
for we have been of little help. He may be gone till long after
dark, and when he returns it will be too late for him to devote
any attention to me, even if he has the inclination to do so.
As for Jo," continued Ned, following out his train of thought,
"it may be a long time ere he suspects what has befallen me; I
didn't set any fixed time when I would return, and may stay away
as long as Lena-Wingo himself before he will dream anything has
happened."</p>

<p>His thoughts were called from these speculations by the party
having him in charge. They came to a halt, and acted as if they
had discovered something of an alarming character. Several warriors
darted to cover, as if in quest of something in the undergrowth,
while the others stood listening and peering into the woods about
them. It was natural that Ned should suspect the presence of Lena-Wingo
when he saw this, and his heart beat high with the hope of some
rescue organized by that scout, who was so fertile in all the
expedients of the war-path. Had he reflected, he would have known
that if the Mohawk had attempted any such thing, he would have
managed it in such a way that the Iroquois would not have discovered
it so readily. The halt lasted but a few minutes, when the warriors
who had gone into cover so suddenly reappeared, a few words were
exchanged, and the march was resumed.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what all that was for," thought Ned. "We have
come quite a distance," he added, looking up and about him, "and
we ought to be very near the camp of Colonel Butler by this time."</p>
