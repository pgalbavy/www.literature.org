<p>Soon after Reddy Woodpecker settled in Farmer Green’s orchard he noticed
that a certain person often followed him.  The stranger wore gray fur
and always flourished a long, bushy tail behind him.  He could climb
trees as well as Reddy Woodpecker himself.  And though he couldn’t fly,
he was very skillful at leaping from one tree top into another.
</p><p>Whenever Reddy Woodpecker happened to turn around and spy this lurking
stranger the fellow acted as if he hadn’t seen Reddy Woodpecker.  He
would pretend to whisk a bit of bark off the tip of his tail, or arrange
his mustache.  But the moment Reddy turned his back upon him the
stranger would creep a little nearer.
</p><p>At last this sly person made a quick dash at Reddy Woodpecker one day.
He discovered, then, that Reddy was both wide-awake and spry.  For Reddy
slipped off the tree trunk where he had been clinging and easily escaped
the greedy clutches of the stranger.
</p><p>It’s no wonder that Reddy was angry. No one would care to have his
breakfast interrupted in such a fashion.
</p><p>"I knew that sneak meant to catch me if he could," Reddy muttered to
himself as he went on with his breakfast.
</p><p>A few moments later his cousin Mr. Flicker settled upon an ant hill
below him.
</p><p>"Who is that stranger?" Reddy Woodpecker asked Mr. Flicker.
</p><p>Mr. Flicker glanced at the sly person who was just dodging behind a
limb.
</p><p>"He’s no stranger," said Mr. Flicker. "He has lived here a good deal
longer than you have.  That’s Frisky Squirrel."
</p><p>"Well, he’s a little too frisky," Reddy Woodpecker scolded.  "He just
jumped at me.  He has been trying to catch me ever since I came to the
farm."
</p><p>Mr. Flicker laughed.
</p><p>"That’s a regular trick of his," he remarked.  "He’s always jumping off
a fence post at me.  But I have no trouble dodging him."
</p><p>"I don’t see why he wants to catch me," Reddy grumbled.  "He can’t
know—yet—that I’m fond of nuts.  But in the fall, when the nuts are
ripe, I expect I’ll make him almost crazy."
</p><p>The next time Reddy met his tormentor he called to him as pleasantly as
if there’d never been any trouble between them.
</p><p>"How’s this place for nuts?"
</p><p>"Fine!" cried Frisky Squirrel.  "The woods beyond the meadow are famous
for their beechnuts."
</p><p>"That’s good news," said Reddy.  "I’m glad I settled here."’
</p><p>Frisky gave him a sharp look.  "You don’t like beechnuts, do you?" he
asked.
</p><p>"Don’t I?  Oh, don’t I?" Reddy cried.
</p><p>Strange to say Frisky Squirrel knew the answer to that question.
</p><p>"Oh!  You <u>do</u> like them!" he chattered. "Well, maybe there aren’t as
many beechnuts as I thought.  Maybe the beechnutting is poor here.  No
doubt I’m mistaken about it.  Why don’t you go over on the other side of
Blue Mountain to live? You’re <u>sure</u> to find plenty of beechnuts over
there next fall."
</p><p>Reddy Woodpecker laughed heartily. Frisky Squirrel could not deceive
him.
