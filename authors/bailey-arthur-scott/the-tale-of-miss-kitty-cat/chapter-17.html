<p>FOR ANYBODY that was so faint, Moses Mouse ran to the box of potatoes
very spryly. His wife was already inside it, eating.
</p>
<p>"I'll have my supper first," he announced, "while you stay outside on
the cellar bottom and watch for Miss Snooper."
</p><p>"I'm just as hungry as you are," his wife objected. "I don't want to
wait. You know you'll be a long time at your supper." What she really
meant was that Moses Mouse would be sure to overeat.
</p><p>"Very well!" he said. "But don't blame me if Miss Snooper sneaks up on
us."
</p><p>Thereupon Moses Mouse fell to right greedily. Although there were
delicacies that he liked more than raw potatoes, he was hungry enough to
enjoy them--and not even ask for salt. And his wife, too, ate almost as
heartily as he did. The pale moonlight, streaming through the cellar
window, lighted their banquet hall with its ghostly gleams. They enjoyed
the cool dampness of the place. They liked its musty smell. And Moses
Mouse remarked--between mouthfuls--that they hadn't had such an elegant
feast for weeks. "It's quite like old times," he said.
</p><p>Mrs. Mouse agreed with him. Indeed, they relished their meal so
thoroughly that they forgot everything else. And if Moses Mouse hadn't
happened to glance up and see two eyes gleaming at him from over the
edge of the box he would have had no reason for leaving his meal
unfinished. At the moment, his mouth was crammed so full of raw potato
that he could scarcely say a word.
</p><p>"Miss Snooper!" he gasped, all but choking over the words. And he
vanished in a twinkling, hoping, of course, that Mrs. Mouse would take
the hint and disappear too, but not waiting to see whether she managed
to get away safely.
</p><p>A second later Miss Kitty Cat sprang into the box. She reached out a paw
and grabbed at what looked like Mrs. Mouse. But to her great disgust she
found her claws clutching nothing more interesting than a small potato,
with a little knob at one end that looked not unlike a head.
</p><p>Miss Kitty Cat let go of her prize with a mew of disappointment. She
knew that by that time Mr. and Mrs. Mouse had made their escape. And
Miss Kitty soon learned how they slipped away. In one corner of the box
she found a tiny hole. "Here's where they went!" she exclaimed. "I don't
see how I missed seeing it when I first came sniffing around this box."
</p><p>Though she had lost a midnight supper, Miss Kitty did not feel too sad.
She was too angry for that.
</p><p>"At last," she cried, "I've found out what old dog Spot wouldn't tell
me. The mice are calling me 'Miss Snooper' behind my back!"
</p><p>In the morning, when Miss Kitty met old dog Spot in the woodshed, she
was still feeling peevish. "What are you doing in here?" she snapped.
</p><p>"Oh, I'm just snooping around to see what I can find for my breakfast,"
he told her with a grin.
</p><p>Miss Kitty Cat bared her teeth in a snarl.
</p><p>"_Snooping!_" she cried. "You'd better be careful what you say to me! I
heard some mice talking last night."
</p><p>"Ah!" said old Spot. "Now you know that listeners seldom hear anything
good about themselves."
</p><p>Then he decided, suddenly, that he would look elsewhere for his
breakfast.
</p><p>For Miss Kitty Cat was in a terrible temper.
