<p>A reply came from Colles, addressed not to me but to Japp. It
seemed that the old fellow had once suggested the establishment
of a branch store at a place out in the plains called Umvelos',
and the firm was now prepared to take up the scheme.  Japp was
in high good humour, and showed me the letter.  Not a word was
said of what I had written about, only the bare details about
starting the branch.  I was to get a couple of masons, load up
two wagons with bricks and timber, and go down to Umvelos' and
see the store built.  The stocking of it and the appointment of
a storekeeper would be matter for further correspondence.  Japp
was delighted, for, besides getting rid of me for several weeks,
it showed that his advice was respected by his superiors.  He
went about bragging that the firm could not get on without him,
and was inclined to be more insolent to me than usual in his new
self-esteem.  He also got royally drunk over the head of it.</p>

<p>I confess I was hurt by the manager's silence on what seemed
to me more vital matters.  But I soon reflected that if he wrote
at all he would write direct to me, and I eagerly watched for
the post-runner.  No letter came, however, and I was soon too
busy with preparations to look for one.  I got the bricks and
timber from Pietersdorp, and hired two Dutch masons to run the
job.  The place was not very far from Sikitola's kraal, so there
would be no difficulty about native helpers. Having my eyes open
for trade, I resolved to kill two birds with one stone.  It was
the fashion among the old-fashioned farmers on the high-veld to
drive the cattle down into the bush-veld&mdash;which they call the
winter-veld&mdash;for winter pasture.  There is no fear of red-water
about that season, and the grass of the plains is rich and thick
compared with the uplands.  I discovered that some big droves
were passing on a certain day, and that the owners and their families
were travelling with them in wagons.  Accordingly I had a light
<em>naachtmaal</em> fitted up as a sort of travelling store, and
with my two wagons full of building material joined the caravan. 
I hoped to do good trade in selling little luxuries to the farmers
on the road and at Umvelos'.</p>

<p>It was a clear cold morning when we started down the Berg. At
first my hands were full with the job of getting my heavy wagons
down the awesome precipice which did duty as a highway.  We locked
the wheels with chains, and tied great logs of wood behind to
act as brakes. Happily my drivers knew their business, but one
of the Boer wagons got a wheel over the edge, and it was all that
ten men could do to get it back again.</p>

<p>After that the road was easier, winding down the side of a slowly
opening glen.  I rode beside the wagons, and so heavenly was the
weather that I was content with my own thoughts. The sky was clear
blue, the air warm, yet with a wintry tonic in it, and a thousand
aromatic scents came out of the thickets. The pied birds called
'Kaffir queens' fluttered across the path. Below, the Klein Labongo
churned and foamed in a hundred cascades.  Its waters were no
more the clear grey of the 'Blue Wildebeeste's Spring,' but growing
muddy with its approach to the richer soil of the plains.</p>

<p>Oxen travel slow, and we outspanned that night half a day's march
short of Umvelos'.  I spent the hour before sunset lounging and
smoking with the Dutch farmers.  At first they had been silent
and suspicious of a newcomer, but by this time I talked their
taal fluently, and we were soon on good terms. I recall a discussion
arising about a black thing in a tree about five hundred yards
away.  I thought it was an aasvogel, but another thought it was
a baboon.  Whereupon the oldest of the party, a farmer called
Coetzee, whipped up his rifle and, apparently without sighting,
fired.  A dark object fell out of the branch, and when we reached
it we found it a <em>baviaan</em>[1] sure enough, shot through
the head.  'Which side are you on in the next war?' the old man
asked me, and, laughing, I told him 'Yours.'</p>

<p>After supper, the ingredients of which came largely from my <em>naachtmaal</em>,
we sat smoking and talking round the fire, the women and children
being snug in the covered wagons.  The Boers were honest companionable
fellows, and when I had made a bowl of toddy in the Scotch fashion
to keep out the evening chill, we all became excellent friends. 
They asked me how I got on with Japp.  Old Coetzee saved me the
trouble of answering, for he broke in with <em>Skellum</em>! 
<em>Skellum</em>![2]  I asked him his objection to the storekeeper,
but he would say nothing beyond that he was too thick with the
natives.  I fancy at some time Mr Japp had sold him a bad plough.</p>

<p>We spoke of hunting, and I heard long tales of exploits&mdash;away
on the Limpopo, in Mashonaland, on the Sabi and in the Lebombo. 
Then we verged on politics, and I listened to violent denunciations
of the new land tax.  These were old residenters, I reflected,
and I might learn perhaps something of value.  So very carefully
I repeated a tale I said I had heard at Durban of a great wizard
somewhere in the Berg, and asked if any one knew of it.  They
shook their heads.  The natives had given up witchcraft and big
medicine, they said, and were more afraid of a parson or a policeman
than any witch-doctor. Then they were starting on reminiscences,
when old Coetzee, who was deaf, broke in and asked to have my
question repeated.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'I know.  It is in the Rooirand.  There is a
devil dwells there.'</p>

<p>I could get no more out of him beyond the fact that there was
certainly a great devil there.  His grandfather and father had
seen it, and he himself had heard it roaring when he had gone
there as a boy to hunt. He would explain no further, and went
to bed.</p>

<p>Next morning, close to Sikitola's kraal, I bade the farmers good-bye,
after telling them that there would be a store in my wagon for
three weeks at Umvelos' if they wanted supplies. We then struck
more to the north towards our destination.  As soon as they had
gone I had out my map and searched it for the name old Coetzee
had mentioned.  It was a very bad map, for there had been no surveying
east of the Berg, and most of the names were mere guesses.  But
I found the word 'Rooirand' marking an eastern continuation of
the northern wall, and probably set down from some hunter's report. 
I had better explain here the chief features of the country, for
they bulk largely in my story.  The Berg runs north and south,
and from it run the chief streams which water the plain.  They
are, beginning from the south, the Olifants, the Groot Letaba,
the Letsitela, the Klein Letaba, and the Klein Labongo, on which
stands Blaauwildebeestefontein.  But the greatest river of the
plain, into which the others ultimately flow, is the Groot Labongo,
which appears full-born from some subterranean source close to
the place called Umvelos'.  North from Blaauwildebeestefontein
the Berg runs for some twenty miles, and then makes a sharp turn
eastward, becoming, according to my map, the Rooirand.</p>

<p>I pored over these details, and was particularly curious about
the Great Labongo.  It seemed to me unlikely that a spring in
the bush could produce so great a river, and I decided that its
source must lie in the mountains to the north.  As well as I could
guess, the Rooirand, the nearest part of the Berg, was about thirty
miles distant.  Old Coetzee had said that there was a devil in
the place, but I thought that if it were explored the first thing
found would be a fine stream of water.</p>

<p>We got to Umvelos' after midday, and outspanned for our three
weeks' work.  I set the Dutchmen to unload and clear the ground
for foundations, while I went off to Sikitola to ask for labourers. 
I got a dozen lusty blacks, and soon we had a business-like encampment,
and the work went on merrily.  It was rough architecture and rougher
masonry.  All we aimed at was a two-roomed shop with a kind of
outhouse for stores.  I was architect, and watched the marking
out of the foundations and the first few feet of the walls.  Sikitola's
people proved themselves good helpers, and most of the building
was left to them, while the Dutchmen worked at the carpentry. 
Bricks ran short before we got very far, and we had to set to
brick-making on the bank of the Labongo, and finish off the walls
with green bricks, which gave the place a queer piebald look.</p>

<p>I was not much of a carpenter, and there were plenty of builders
without me, so I found a considerable amount of time on my hands. 
At first I acted as shopkeeper in the <em>naachtmaal</em>, but
I soon cleared out my stores to the Dutch farmers and the natives. 
I had thought of going back for more, and then it occurred to
me that I might profitably give some of my leisure to the Rooirand. 
I could see the wall of the mountains quite clear to the north,
within an easy day's ride.  So one morning I packed enough food
for a day or two, tied my sleeping-bag on my saddle, and set off
to explore, after appointing the elder of the Dutchmen foreman
of the job in my absence.</p>

<p>It was very hot jogging along the native path with the eternal
olive-green bush around me.  Happily there was no fear of losing
the way, for the Rooirand stood very clear in front, and slowly,
as I advanced, I began to make out the details of the cliffs. 
At luncheon-time, when I was about half-way, I sat down with my
Zeiss glass&mdash;my mother's farewell gift&mdash;to look for the valley. 
But valley I saw none.  The wall&mdash;reddish purple it looked, and,
I thought, of porphyry&mdash;was continuous and unbroken.  There were
chimneys and fissures, but none great enough to hold a river. 
The top was sheer cliff; then came loose kranzes in tiers, like
the seats in a gallery, and, below, a dense thicket of trees. 
I raked the whole line for a break, but there seemed none.  'It's
a bad job for me,' I thought, 'if there is no water, for I must
pass the night there.' The night was spent in a sheltered nook
at the foot of the rocks, but my horse and I went to bed without
a drink.  My supper was some raisins and biscuits, for I did not
dare to run the risk of increasing my thirst.  I had found a great
bank of <em>débris</em> sloping up to the kranzes, and thick wood
clothing all the slope.  The grass seemed wonderfully fresh, but
of water there was no sign.  There was not even the sandy channel
of a stream to dig in.</p>

<p>In the morning I had a difficult problem to face.  Water I must
find at all costs, or I must go home.  There was time enough for
me to get back without suffering much, but if so I must give up
my explorations.  This I was determined not to do.  The more I
looked at these red cliffs the more eager I was to find out their
secret.  There must be water somewhere; otherwise how account
for the lushness of the vegetation?</p>

<p>My horse was a veld pony, so I set him loose to see what he would
do. He strayed back on the path to Umvelos'.  This looked bad,
for it meant that he did not smell water along the cliff front. 
If I was to find a stream it must be on the top, and I must try
a little mountaineering.</p>

<p>Then, taking my courage in both my hands, I decided.  I gave
my pony a cut, and set him off on the homeward road.  I knew he
was safe to get back in four or five hours, and in broad day there
was little fear of wild beasts attacking him.  I had tied my sleeping
bag on to the saddle, and had with me but two pocketfuls of food. 
I had also fastened on the saddle a letter to my Dutch foreman,
bidding him send a native with a spare horse to fetch me by the
evening.  Then I started off to look for a chimney.</p>

<p>A boyhood spent on the cliffs at Kirkcaple had made me a bold
cragsman, and the porphyry of the Rooirand clearly gave excellent
holds.  But I walked many weary miles along the cliff-foot before
I found a feasible road.  To begin with, it was no light task
to fight one's way through the dense undergrowth of the lower
slopes.  Every kind of thorn-bush lay in wait for my skin, creepers
tripped me up, high trees shut out the light, and I was in constant
fear lest a black <em>mamba</em> might appear out of the tangle. 
It grew very hot, and the screes above the thicket were blistering
to the touch.  My tongue, too, stuck to the roof of my mouth with
thirst.</p>

<p>The first chimney I tried ran out on the face into nothingness,
and I had to make a dangerous descent.  The second was a deep
gully, but so choked with rubble that after nearly braining myself
I desisted.  Still going eastwards, I found a sloping ledge which
took me to a platform from which ran a crack with a little tree
growing in it.  My glass showed me that beyond this tree the crack
broadened into a clearly defined chimney which led to the top. 
If I can once reach that tree, I thought, the battle is won. The
crack was only a few inches wide, large enough to let in an arm
and a foot, and it ran slantwise up a perpendicular rock.  I do
not think I realized how bad it was till I had gone too far to
return.  Then my foot jammed, and I paused for breath with my
legs and arms cramping rapidly.  I remember that I looked to the
west, and saw through the sweat which kept dropping into my eyes
that about half a mile off a piece of cliff which looked unbroken
from the foot had a fold in it to the right.  The darkness of
the fold showed me that it was a deep, narrow gully.  However,
I had no time to think of this, for I was fast in the middle of
my confounded crack.  With immense labour I found a chockstone
above my head, and managed to force my foot free.  The next few
yards were not so difficult, and then I stuck once more.</p>

<p>For the crack suddenly grew shallow as the cliff bulged out above
me. I had almost given up hope, when I saw that about three feet
above my head grew the tree.  If I could reach it and swing out
I might hope to pull myself up to the ledge on which it grew. 
I confess it needed all my courage, for I did not know but that
the tree might be loose, and that it and I might go rattling down
four hundred feet.  It was my only hope, however, so I set my
teeth, and wriggling up a few inches, made a grab at it.  Thank
God it held, and with a great effort I pulled my shoulder over
the ledge, and breathed freely.</p>

<p>My difficulties were not ended, but the worst was past.  The
rest of the gully gave me good and safe climbing, and presently
a very limp and weary figure lay on the cliff-top.  It took me
many minutes to get back my breath and to conquer the faintness
which seized me as soon as the need for exertion was over.</p>

<p>When I scrambled to my feet and looked round, I saw a wonderful
prospect.  It was a plateau like the high-veld, only covered with
bracken and little bushes like hazels.  Three or four miles off
the ground rose, and a shallow vale opened.  But in the foreground,
half a mile or so distant, a lake lay gleaming in the sun.</p>

<p>I could scarcely believe my eyes as I ran towards it, and doubts
of a mirage haunted me.  But it was no mirage, but a real lake,
perhaps three miles in circumference, with bracken-fringed banks,
a shore of white pebbles, and clear deep blue water.  I drank
my fill, and then stripped and swam in the blessed coolness. 
After that I ate some luncheon, and sunned myself on a flat rock. 
'I have discovered the source of the Labongo,' I said to myself. 
'I will write to the Royal Geographical Society, and they will
give me a medal.'</p>

<p>I walked round the lake to look for an outlet.  A fine mountain
stream came in at the north end, and at the south end, sure enough,
a considerable river debauched.  My exploring zeal redoubled,
and I followed its course in a delirium of expectation.  It was
a noble stream, clear as crystal, and very unlike the muddy tropical
Labongo at Umvelos'.  Suddenly, about a quarter of a mile from
the lake, the land seemed to grow over it, and with a swirl and
a hollow roar, it disappeared into a mighty pot-hole.  I walked
a few steps on, and from below my feet came the most uncanny rumbling
and groaning. Then I knew what old Coetzee's devil was that howled
in the Rooirand.</p>

<p>Had I continued my walk to the edge of the cliff, I might have
learned a secret which would have stood me in good stead later. 
But the descent began to make me anxious, and I retraced my steps
to the top of the chimney whence I had come.  I was resolved that
nothing would make me descend by that awesome crack, so I kept
on eastward along the top to look for a better way.  I found one
about a mile farther on, which, though far from easy, had no special
risks save from the appalling looseness of the <em>débris</em>. 
When I got down at length, I found that it was near sunset.  I
went to the place I had bidden my native look for me at, but,
as I had feared, there was no sign of him.  So, making the best
of a bad job, I had supper and a pipe, and spent a very chilly
night in a hole among the boulders.</p>

<p>I got up at dawn stiff and cold, and ate a few raisins for breakfast.
There was no sign of horses, so I resolved to fill up the time
in looking for the fold of the cliff which, as I had seen from
the horrible crack of yesterday, contained a gully.  It was a
difficult job, for to get the sidelong view of the cliff I had
to scramble through the undergrowth of the slopes again, and even
a certain way up the kranzes.  At length I got my bearings, and
fixed the place by some tall trees in the bush.  Then I descended
and walked westwards.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I neared the place, I heard the strangest sound
coming from the rocks.  It was a deep muffled groaning, so eerie
and unearthly that for the moment I stood and shivered. Then I
remembered my river of yesterday.  It must be above this place
that it descended into the earth, and in the hush of dawn the
sound was naturally louder.  No wonder old Coetzee had been afraid
of devils.  It reminded me of the lines in <em>Marmion</em>&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'Diving as if condemned to lave<br/>
Some demon's subterranean cave,<br/>
Who, prisoned by enchanter's spell,<br/>
Shakes the dark rock with groan and yell.'

</p>
</div>
<p>While I was standing awestruck at the sound, I observed a figure
moving towards the cliffs.  I was well in cover, so I could not
have been noticed.  It was a very old man, very tall, but bowed
in the shoulders, who was walking slowly with bent head.  He could
not have been thirty yards from me, so I had a clear view of his
face.  He was a native, but of a type I had never seen before. 
A long white beard fell on his breast, and a magnificent kaross
of leopard skin covered his shoulders. His face was seamed and
lined and shrunken, so that he seemed as old as Time itself.</p>

<p>Very carefully I crept after him, and found myself opposite the
fold where the gully was.  There was a clear path through the
jungle, a path worn smooth by many feet.  I followed it through
the undergrowth and over the screes till it turned inside the
fold of the gully.  And then it stopped short.  I was in a deep
cleft, but in front was a slab of sheer rock.  Above, the gully
looked darker and deeper, but there was this great slab to pass. 
I examined the sides, but they were sheer rock with no openings.</p>

<p>Had I had my wits about me, I would have gone back and followed
the spoor, noting where it stopped.  But the whole thing looked
black magic to me; my stomach was empty and my enterprise small. 
Besides, there was the terrible moaning of the imprisoned river
in my ears.  I am ashamed to confess it, but I ran from that gully
as if the devil and all his angels had been following me.  Indeed,
I did not slacken till I had put a good mile between me and those
uncanny cliffs.  After that I set out to foot it back.  If the
horses would not come to me I must go to them.</p>

<p>I walked twenty-five miles in a vile temper, enraged at my Dutchmen,
my natives, and everybody.  The truth is, I had been frightened,
and my pride was sore about it.  It grew very hot, the sand rose
and choked me, the mopani trees with their dull green wearied
me, the 'Kaffir queens' and jays and rollers which flew about
the path seemed to be there to mock me. About half-way home I
found a boy and two horses, and roundly I cursed him.  It seemed
that my pony had returned right enough, and the boy had been sent
to fetch me.  He had got half-way before sunset the night before,
and there he had stayed.  I discovered from him that he was scared
to death, and did not dare go any nearer the Rooirand.  It was
accursed, he said, for it was an abode of devils, and only wizards
went near it.  I was bound to admit to myself that I could not
blame him. At last I had got on the track of something certain
about this mysterious country, and all the way back I wondered
if I should have the courage to follow it up.</p>
