<p>Every boy and girl ought to live a hundred years. When worn out
at last by old age, death will come like sweet sleep, without
pain, or suffering.</p>

<p>No one can live very long, unless he obeys the laws of health.
These laws are so simple that all can learn them. Many people
remain ignorant of them until they grow to be men and women, when
they find it too late to escape the penalty which nature visits
on those who break her laws.</p>

<p>One of the first things that boys and girls should study is how
to keep the health which their kind Creator has given them. Such
knowledge will save them days and nights of suffering and perhaps
bring them many years of enjoyment.</p>

<p>Children give little thought to the care of their bodies, and
often form habits whose ill effects are not seen for a long time.
Let them, therefore, try to learn, in early life, what is right
and wrong in this respect.</p>

<p>It is not a hard study. What is more interesting than to learn
about the most wonderful machine in the world? That machine is
yourself. There never can be any invention to compare with it.
God alone can create it, and it is your duty to do all you can
to keep it running until worn out.</p>

<p>Anatomy is the study of the structure or make-up of our bodies.
Physiology tells of the offices or purposes of all the parts of
our bodies. Hygiene, or Good Health, is the knowledge of the laws
by which all the organs and parts of our bodies are kept in the
best possible condition.</p>

<p>  How long ought every boy and girl to live? What is said of
death   from old age?</p>

<p>  What is necessary to secure long life? Are these laws simple?
What   mistake is made by many people?</p>

<p>  What should be one of the first things for boys and girls to
learn?   What will such knowledge save them?</p>

<p>  What do children do? What, therefore, should they try to learn?</p>

<p>  Is it a hard study? What is the most wonderful machine in the
world?   What is your duty?</p>

<p>  What is Anatomy? Physiology? Hygiene, or Good Health? </p>
