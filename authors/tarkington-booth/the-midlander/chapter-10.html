<p><em>HALF </em>an hour later he brought her a tray, a dainty one
prepared by his mother, and set it upon a table close beside the
bed.</p>

<p>"Here you are, dearie," he said gayly. "Jellied chicken, cold
as ice, and iced tea and ice-cold salad. Not a thing hot except
some nice crisp toast. You’ll feel like running a foot-race after
you eat it, Lena!"</p>

<p>She spoke without moving, keeping her face away from him. "Are
those women still downstairs?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Your grandmother and that big girl—the awful one."</p>

<p>"You don’t mean——"</p>

<p>"I asked you if they’re still in the house."</p>

<p>"They’re just goin’ home, Lena. Martha told me to tell you how
sorry she is you feel the heat so badly. Won’t you eat something
now, please, dear?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>"Please! You’ll feel all right again if you’ll eat something,
and to-morrow morning we’ll drive out to Ornaby Addition. <em>Then</em>
you’ll feel like a <em>queen</em>, Lena; because it’s all yours
and you’ll see what it’s goin’ to do for us."</p>

<p>"Do you think it will get us away from here?" she asked in a
dead voice.</p>

<p>"Well, by that time," Dan answered cheerfully, "I expect maybe
you won’t want to get away."</p>

<p>"‘By that time,’" she said, quoting him dismally. "You mean it’s
going to be a <em>long</em> time?"</p>

<p>"Lena, I wish you’d just look at this tray. I know if you’d only
look at it, you couldn’t help eating. You’d——"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush!" she moaned, and struck her pillow a futile blow.
"Someone told me once that you people out here always <em>were</em>
trying to get everybody to eat, that you thought just eating would
cure everything. I suppose you and all your family have been eating
away, downstairs there, just the same as ever. It makes me die
to think of it! I’ve had delirium in fevers, but I never was delirious
enough to imagine a place where there wasn’t <em>some</em> mercy
in the heat! There isn’t any here; it’s almost dusk and hotter
than ever. I couldn’t any more eat than if I were some poor thing
cooking alive on a grill. What on earth do you want me to <em>eat</em>
for?"</p>

<p>"Well, dearie," he said placatively. "I think it would strengthen
you and make you feel so much better, maybe you’d be willing to—to——"
He hesitated, faltering.</p>

<p>"To what?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see grandma’s so terribly old—and just these last
few months she’s broken so—we know we can’t hope to see much more
of her, dear; and so we make quite a little fuss over her when
she’s able to come here. I did hope maybe you’d feel able to go
down with me to tell her good-night."</p>

<p>At that, Lena struck the pillow again, and then again and again;
she beat it with a listless desperation. "Didn’t you <em>understand</em>
what I said to you about her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but I know that was just a little nervousness, Lena;
you didn’t really mean it. I know you feel differently about it
already."</p>

<p>"No!" she cried, interrupting him sharply. "No! No!" And then,
in her pain, her voice became so passionately vehement that Dan
was alarmed. "No! No! <em>No!</em>"</p>

<p>"Lena! I’m afraid they’ll hear you downstairs."</p>

<p>"What do <em>I</em> care!" she cried so loudly that Martha Shelby,
in the twilight of the yard below, on her way to the gate, paused
and half turned; and Dan saw her through the open window. "What
do <em>I</em> care!" Lena screamed. "What do I <em>care</em>!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" he groaned, and though Martha hurried on he was
sure that she had heard.</p>

<p>"I don’t <em>care</em>!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" he groaned again, and went to close the door which
he had thoughtlessly left open when he came into the room. But,
to his dismay, before he closed it he heard Mrs. Savage’s still
sonorous voice in the hall downstairs: "No, don’t bother him.
Harlan’s enough to get me home. But if <em>I</em> had a daughter-in-law
with tantrums I’d mighty soon cure her."</p>

<p>At that point Dan shut the door hurriedly, and went back to the
bedside. "Lena," he said, in great distress, "if you won’t eat
anything, I just don’t see what I can do!"</p>

<p>"You don’t?" she asked, and turned to look at him. "It seems
to me nothing could be simpler. You know perfectly well what you
can do."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Take me out of this. Keep your promise to me and take me abroad."</p>

<p>"But I <em>can’t</em>, dearie," he explained. "You see I didn’t
realize it was a promise exactly, and now it’s just out of the
question. You see everything we’ve got is in Ornaby Addition and
so——"</p>

<p>"Then sell it."</p>

<p>"What? Why, I wouldn’t have anything left at all if I did that
at this stage of the work. You see——"</p>

<p>"Then put a mortgage on it. People can always get money by mortgages."</p>

<p>Dan rubbed his forehead. "I’ve already got a mortgage on it,"
he said. "That’s where the money came from I’m workin’ with now."
He sighed, then went on more cheerfully. "But just wait till you
see it, Lena. We’ll drive out there first thing to-morrow morning
and you’ll understand right away what a big thing you and I own
together. You just wait! Why, two or three weeks from now—maybe
only two or three days from now—you’ll be as enthusiastic over
Ornaby as I am!" He leaned over her, smiling, and took her hand.
"Honestly, Lena, I don’t want to brag—I wouldn’t want to brag
to you, the last person in the world—but honestly, I believe it’s
goin’ to be the biggest thing that’s ever been done in this town.
You see if we can only get the city limits extended and run a
boulevard out there——"</p>

<p>But here she startled him; she snatched her hand away and burst
into a convulsive sobbing that shook every inch of her. "Oh, dear!"
she wailed. "I’m trapped! I’m trapped!"</p>

<p>This was all he could get from her during the next half hour;
that she was "trapped," repeated over and over in a heartbroken
voice at intervals in the sobbing; and Dan, agonized at the sight
and sound of such poignantly genuine suffering, found nothing
to offer in the way of effective solace. He tried to pet her,
to stroke her forehead, but at every such impulse of his she tossed
away from his extended hand. Then, in desperation, he fell back
upon renewed entreaties that she would eat, tempting her with
appetizing descriptions of the food he had brought and, when these
were so unsuccessful that she made him carry the untouched tray
out into the hall and leave it there, he returned to make further
prophecies of the restorative powers of Ornaby Addition.</p>

<p>Once she saw Ornaby, he said, she would be fairly in love with
it; and he was so unfortunate as to add that he knew she would
soon get used to his grandmother and like her.</p>

<p>Lena was growing somewhat more composed until he spoke of his
grandmother; but instantly, as if the relation between this cause
and its effect had already established itself as permanently automatic,
she uttered a loud cry of pain, the sobbing again became convulsive;
and Dan perceived that for a considerable time to come it would
be better to omit even the mention of Mrs. Savage in his wife’s
presence.</p>

<p>Darkness came upon the room where Lena tossed and lamented, and
the young husband walked up and down until she begged him to stop.
He sat by an open window, helplessly distressed to find that whatever
he did seemed to hurt her; for, when he had been silent awhile
she wailed piteously, "Oh, heavens! Why can’t you <em>say</em>
something?" And when he began to speak reassuringly of the climate,
telling her that the oppressive weather was only "a little hot
spell," she tossed and moaned the more.</p>

<p>So the long evening passed in slow, hot hours laden with emotions
that also burned. From the window Dan saw the family carriage
return from Mrs. Savage’s; the horses shaking themselves in their
lathered harness when they halted on the driveway to let Harlan
out. He went indoors, to the library as usual, Dan guessed vaguely;
and after a while Mr. and Mrs. Oliphant came from the house and
walked slowly up and down the path that led through the lawn to
the gate. They were "taking the air"—or as much of it as there
was to be taken—and, walking, thus together, the two figures seemed
to express a congeniality Dan had never before noticed with attention,
although he had been aware of it all his life. Both of them had
retained their slenderness, and in the night were so youthful
looking that they might have been taken for a pair of young lovers,
except for the peacefulness seeming to be theirs. This emanation
of a serenity between them suddenly became perceptible to their
son as a surprising thing; and he looked down upon them wonderingly.</p>

<p>There came a querulous inquiry from the bed. "What on earth are
you staring at?"</p>

<p>"Only father and mother. They’re outdoors coolin’ off."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" Lena said. "Cooling off!"</p>

<p>"You’re feelin’ better now, aren’t you, Lena?" he asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"‘Better!’" she wailed. "Oh, heavens!"</p>

<p>Dan rested his elbows on the window-sill, and his chin on his
hands. "They’re comin’ in, now," he said after a while. "They’ve
had their little evening walk in the yard together. They nearly
always do that when the weather isn’t too cold."</p>

<p>"‘Cold?’ I suppose this place gets just as cold in winter as
it does hot in summer!"</p>

<p>"It <em>does</em> get pretty cold here in winter sometimes,"
the thoughtless Dan said, with a touch of pride. "Why, last February——"</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens!" Lena wailed; and she began to weep again.</p>

<p>About midnight she was quiet, and Dan, going near her, discovered
that she drowsed. His foot touched something upon the carpet,
and he picked up the string of artificial pearls, put it upon
the table beside the bed, then tiptoed out of the room, closing
the door with great care to make no noise. The house was silent
and solidly dark as he went down the broad stairway and opened
the front door to let himself out into the faint illumination
of the summer night. It was a night profoundly hushed and motionless;
and within it, enclosed in heat, the town lay prostrate.</p>

<p>Sighing heavily, the young husband walked to and fro upon the
short grass of the lawn, wondering what had "happened" to Lena—as
he thought of it—to upset her so; wondering, too, what had happened
to himself, that since he had married her she had most of the
time seemed to him to be, not the Lena he thought he knew, but
an inexplicable stranger. This was a mystery beyond his experience,
and he could only sigh and shake his inadequate head; meanwhile
pacing beneath the midnight stars. But they were neither puzzled
nor surprised, those experienced stars, so delicately bright in
the warm sky, for they had looked down upon uncounted other young
husbands in his plight and pacing as he did.</p>

<p>By and by he stood still, aware of another presence in the dimness
of the neighbouring yard. The only sound in all the world seemed
to be a minute tinkling and plashing of water where the stoic
swan maintained himself at his duty while other birds slept; but
upon the stone rim of the fountain Dan thought he discerned a
white figure sitting. He went to the fence between the two lawns
to make sure, and found that he was right; a large and graceful
woman sat there, leaning over and drawing one hand meditatively
to and fro through the water.</p>

<p>"Martha?" he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>She looked up, said "Dan!" under her breath, and came to the
fence. "Why, you poor thing! You’re still in that heavy long coat!"</p>

<p>"Am I?" he asked vaguely. "I hadn’t noticed."</p>

<p>"‘Hadn’t noticed?’ In this weather!"</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> fairly hot," he said, as though this circumstance
had just been called to his attention.</p>

<p>"Then why don’t you take it off?"</p>

<p>"My coat?" he returned absently. "I don’t mind it."</p>

<p>"I do," Martha said. "You don’t need to bother about talking
to <em>me</em> with your coat off, do you? It’s only a dozen years
or so since we hid our shoes and stockings in the harness closet
in your stable and ran off barefoot to go wading in the street
after a thunderstorm. Take it off."</p>

<p>"Well——" He complied, explaining, "I just came out to get cool."</p>

<p>"So did I; but I don’t believe it can be done, Dan. I believe
this is the worst night for sheer hotness we’ve had in two or
three years. I haven’t felt it so much since the day I landed
in New York from Cherbourg, summer before last. I’ll never forget
that day!"</p>

<p>"In New York?" he asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"I should say so! I suppose I felt it more because I was just
from abroad, but I think people from our part of the country suffer
fearfully from the heat in New York, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I believe they do," he said thoughtfully. "And New York people
suffer from the heat when they come out here. That must be it."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" She appeared to be surprised. "I don’t see
how New York people could mind the heat anywhere else very much
after what they get at home."</p>

<p>"Oh, but they do, Martha! They suffer terribly from heat if they
come out here, for instance. You see they don’t spend the summers
in New York. They either go abroad in summer or else to the country."</p>

<p>"Does she?" Martha asked quickly; but corrected herself. "Do
they?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, seeming to be unaware of the correction. "That’s
why it upsets her so. You see——"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Well——" he said, hesitating. "It—it does kind of upset her.
It——" He paused, then added lamely, "It’s just the heat, though.
That’s all seems to be really the matter; she can’t stand the
weather."</p>

<p>"She’ll get used to it," Martha said gently. "You mustn’t worry,
Dan."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don’t. In a few days she’ll probably see how lovely it
really is here, and she’ll begin to enjoy it and be more like
herself. Everything’ll be all right in a day or so; I’m sure of
that."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dan."</p>

<p>"Of course just now, what with the heat and all and everybody
strangers to her, why, it’s no wonder it makes her feel a little
upset. Anybody <em>would</em> be, but in a few days from now"—he
hesitated, and concluded, with a somewhat lame insistence, "Well,
it’ll all be entirely different."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dan," she said again, but there was an almost imperceptible
tremble in her voice, and his attention was oddly caught by it.</p>

<p>All his mind had been upon the suffering little bride, but there
was something in the quality of this tremulousness in Martha’s
voice that made him think about Martha, instead. And suddenly
he looked at her with the same wonder he had felt earlier this
queer evening, when he noticed for the first time that emanation
of serenity between his father and mother. For there seemed to
be something about Martha, too, that he had known familiarly all
his life, but had never thought of before.</p>

<p>There is indeed a light that is light in darkness, and these
strange moments of revelation, when they come, are brought most
often by the night. Daylight, showing too many things, may afterwards
doubt them, but they are real and not to be forgotten. They are
only moments; and yet, while this one had its mystic little life,
Dan was possessed in part by the feeling, altogether vague, that
somewhere a peculiar but indefinable mistake had been made by
somebody not identified to him.</p>

<p>Moreover, here was matter more curious still: this thing he had
all his life known about Martha, but had never realized until
now, made her in a moment a woman new to him, so that she seemed
to stand there, facing him across the iron fence, a new Martha.
He had no definition in words for what he felt, nor sought one;
but it was as if he found himself in possession of an ineffable
gift, inexpressibly valuable and shining vaguely in the darkness.
This shining, wan and touching, seemed to come from Martha herself;
and this newness of hers, that was yet so old, put a glamour about
her. The dim, kind face and shimmering familiar figure were beautiful,
he saw, never before having had consciousness of her as beautiful;
but what most seemed to glow upon him out of the glamour about
her was the steadfastness within her; for that was the jewel worn
by the very self of her and shining upon him in the night.</p>

<p>"Martha——" he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dan?"</p>

<p>"You’ve always been such a friend of mine, I—I—I’ve never said
much about how I feel about it. I haven’t got anything I wouldn’t
sooner part with, Martha."</p>

<p>"I hope so," she said gently, and bowed her head in a kind of
meekness. "I hope so, Dan, but——" She stopped.</p>

<p>"But what, Martha?"</p>

<p>"I’m afraid," she said slowly, "your wife isn’t going to like
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, but she will," he returned, trying to put heartiness into
this assurance. "She’s bound to! Why, everybody in the world likes
you, Martha."</p>

<p>"No; I had the feeling as soon as I spoke to her that she never
would, Dan. It was just a feeling, but I’m afraid it’ll turn out
so. That doesn’t mean I won’t try my best to make her."</p>

<p>"You won’t need to try. Of course just now she’s suffering so
terribly, poor little thing——"</p>

<p>"Poor Dan!" Martha said, as he stopped speaking and sighed instead.
"You never <em>could</em> bear to see anybody suffer. The trouble
is it always makes you suffer more than the person that’s doing
the original suffering."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. But I don’t know what on earth to do for her. Of course,
in a few days, when she begins to see what it’s really <em>like</em>
here, and I get her to understand a little more about the Addition——"</p>

<p>He stopped, startled to hear his name called in a querulous little
voice from an upstairs window.</p>

<p>"She’s awake," he said in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Who on earth are you talking with out there?" called the querulous
voice.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he whispered, moving away hurriedly; but, looking
back, he saw that Martha remained at the separating iron fence,
leaning upon it now; and he could feel, rather than see, that
she was not looking at him, but that her head was again bowed
in the same meekness with which she had said she hoped he prized
her feeling for him. </p>
