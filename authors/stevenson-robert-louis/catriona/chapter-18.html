<p>On the morrow, from the justices’ private room, where none could
see me, I heard the verdict given in and judgment rendered upon
James. The Duke’s words I am quite sure I have correctly; and
since that famous passage has been made a subject of dispute,
I may as well commemorate my version. Having referred to the year
’45, the chief of the Campbells, sitting as Justice-General upon
the bench, thus addressed the unfortunate Stewart before him:
"If you had been successful in that rebellion, you might have
been giving the law where you have now received the judgment of
it; we, who are this day your judges, might have been tried before
one of your mock courts of judicature; and then you might have
been satiated with the blood of any name or clan to which you
had an aversion."</p>

<p>"This is to let the cat out of the bag, indeed," thought I. And
that was the general impression. It was extraordinary how the
young advocate lads took hold and made a mock of this speech,
and how scarce a meal passed but what someone would get in the
words: "And then you might have been satiated." Many songs were
made in time for the hour’s diversion, and are near all forgot.
I remember one began:</p>

<p>"What do ye want the bluid of, bluid of? Is it a name, or is
it a clan, Or is it an aefauld Hielandman, That ye want the bluid
of, bluid of?"</p>

<p>Another went to my old favourite air, <em>The House of Airlie</em>,
and began thus:</p>

<p>"It fell on a day when Argyle was on the bench, That they served
him a Stewart for his denner."</p>

<p>And one of the verses ran:</p>

<p>"Then up and spak’ the Duke, and flyted on his cook, I regard
it as a sensible aspersion, That I would sup ava’, an’ satiate
my maw, With the bluid of ony clan of my aversion."</p>

<p>James was as fairly murdered as though the Duke had got a fowling-piece
and stalked him. So much of course I knew: but others knew not
so much, and were more affected by the items of scandal that came
to light in the progress of the cause. One of the chief was certainly
this sally of the justice’s. It was run hard by another of a juryman,
who had struck into the midst of Coulston’s speech for the defence
with a "Pray, sir, cut it short, we are quite weary," which seemed
the very excess of impudence and simplicity. But some of my new
lawyer friends were still more staggered with an innovation that
had disgraced and even vitiated the proceedings. One witness was
never called. His name, indeed, was printed, where it may still
be seen on the fourth page of the list: "James Drummond, <em>alias</em>
Macgregor, <em>alias</em> James More, late tenant in Inveronachile";
and his precognition had been taken, as the manner is, in writing.
He had remembered or invented (God help him) matter which was
lead in James Stewart’s shoes, and I saw was like to prove wings
to his own. This testimony it was highly desirable to bring to
the notice of the jury, without exposing the man himself to the
perils of cross-examination; and the way it was brought about
was a matter of surprise to all. For the paper was handed round
(like a curiosity) in court; passed through the jury-box, where
it did its work; and disappeared again (as though by accident)
before it reached the counsel for the prisoner. This was counted
a most insidious device; and that the name of James More should
be mingled up with it filled me with shame for Catriona and concern
for myself.</p>

<p>The following day, Prestongrange and I, with a considerable company,
set out for Glasgow, where (to my impatience) we continued to
linger some time in a mixture of pleasure and affairs. I lodged
with my lord, with whom I was encouraged to familiarity; had my
place at entertainments; was presented to the chief guests; and
altogether made more of than I thought accorded either with my
parts or station; so that, on strangers being present, I would
often blush for Prestongrange. It must be owned the view I had
taken of the world in these last months was fit to cast a gloom
upon my character. I had met many men, some of them leaders in
Israel whether by their birth or talents; and who among them all
had shown clean hands? As for the Browns and Millers, I had seen
their self-seeking, I could never again respect them. Prestongrange
was the best yet; he had saved me, spared me rather, when others
had it in their minds to murder me outright; but the blood of
James lay at his door; and I thought his present dissimulation
with myself a thing below pardon. That he should affect to find
pleasure in my discourse almost surprised me out of my patience.
I would sit and watch him with a kind of a slow fire of anger
in my bowels. "Ah, friend, friend," I would think to myself, "if
you were but through with this affair of the memorial, would you
not kick me in the streets?" Here I did him, as events have proved,
the most grave injustice; and I think he was at once far more
sincere, and a far more artful performer, than I supposed.</p>

<p>But I had some warrant for my incredulity in the behaviour of
that court of young advocates that hung about in the hope of patronage.
The sudden favour of a lad not previously heard of troubled them
at first out of measure; but two days were not gone by before
I found myself surrounded with flattery and attention. I was the
same young man, and neither better nor bonnier, that they had
rejected a month before; and now there was no civility too fine
for me! The same, do I say? It was not so; and the by-name by
which I went behind my back confirmed it. Seeing me so firm with
the Advocate, and persuaded that I was to fly high and far, they
had taken a word from the golfing green, and called me <em>the
Tee’d Ball</em>. [14] I was told I was now "one of themselves";
I was to taste of their soft lining, who had already made my own
experience of the roughness of the outer husk; and one, to whom
I had been presented in Hope Park, was so aspired as even to remind
me of that meeting. I told him I had not the pleasure of remembering
it.</p>

<p>"Why" says he, "it was Miss Grant herself presented me! My name
is so-and-so."</p>

<p>"It may very well be, sir," said I; "but I have kept no mind
of it."</p>

<p>At which he desisted; and in the midst of the disgust that commonly
overflowed my spirits I had a glisk of pleasure.</p>

<p>But I have not patience to dwell upon that time at length. When
I was in company with these young politics I was borne down with
shame for myself and my own plain ways, and scorn for them and
their duplicity. Of the two evils, I thought Prestongrange to
be the least; and while I was always as stiff as buckram to the
young bloods, I made rather a dissimulation of my hard feelings
towards the Advocate, and was (in old Mr. Campbell’s word) "soople
to the laird." Himself commented on the difference, and bid me
be more of my age, and make friends with my young comrades.</p>

<p>I told him I was slow of making friends.</p>

<p>"I will take the word back," said he. "But there is such a thing
as <em>Fair gude s’en and fair gude day</em>, Mr. David. These
are the same young men with whom you are to pass your days and
get through life: your backwardness has a look of arrogance; and
unless you can assume a little more lightness of manner, I fear
you will meet difficulties in the path."</p>

<p>"It will be an ill job to make a silk purse of a sow’s ear,"
said I.</p>

<p>On the morning of October 1st I was awakened by the clattering
in of an express; and getting to my window almost before he had
dismounted, I saw the messenger had ridden hard. Somewhile after
I was called to Prestongrange, where he was sitting in his bedgown
and nightcap, with his letters round him.</p>

<p>"Mr. David," add he, "I have a piece of news for you. It concerns
some friends of yours, of whom I sometimes think you are a little
ashamed, for you have never referred to their existence."</p>

<p>I suppose I blushed.</p>

<p>"See you understand, since you make the answering signal," said
he. "And I must compliment you on your excellent taste in beauty.
But do you know, Mr. David? this seems to me a very enterprising
lass. She crops up from every side. The Government of Scotland
appears unable to proceed for Mistress Katrine Drummond, which
was somewhat the case (no great while back) with a certain Mr.
David Balfour. Should not these make a good match? Her first intromission
in politics—but I must not tell you that story, the authorities
have decided you are to hear it otherwise and from a livelier
narrator. This new example is more serious, however; and I am
afraid I must alarm you with the intelligence that she is now
in prison."</p>

<p>I cried out.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "the little lady is in prison. But I would not
have you to despair. Unless you (with your friends and memorials)
shall procure my downfall, she is to suffer nothing."</p>

<p>"But what has she done? What is her offence?" I cried.</p>

<p>"It might be almost construed a high treason," he returned, "for
she has broke the king’s Castle of Edinburgh."</p>

<p>"The lady is much my friend," I said. "I know you would not mock
me if the thing were serious."</p>

<p>"And yet it is serious in a sense," said he; "for this rogue
of a Katrine—or Cateran, as we may call her—has set adrift again
upon the world that very doubtful character, her papa."</p>

<p>Here was one of my previsions justified: James More was once
again at liberty. He had lent his men to keep me a prisoner; he
had volunteered his testimony in the Appin case, and the same
(no matter by what subterfuge) had been employed to influence
the jury. Now came his reward, and he was free. It might please
the authorities to give to it the colour of an escape; but I knew
better—I knew it must be the fulfilment of a bargain. The same
course of thought relieved me of the least alarm for Catriona.
She might be thought to have broke prison for her father; she
might have believed so herself. But the chief hand in the whole
business was that of Prestongrange; and I was sure, so far from
letting her come to punishment, he would not suffer her to be
even tried. Whereupon thus came out of me the not very politic
ejaculation:</p>

<p>"Ah! I was expecting that!"</p>

<p>"You have at times a great deal of discretion, too!" says Prestongrange.</p>

<p>"And what is my lord pleased to mean by that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I was just marvelling", he replied, "that being so clever as
to draw these inferences, you should not be clever enough to keep
them to yourself. But I think you would like to hear the details
of the affair. I have received two versions: and the least official
is the more full and far the more entertaining, being from the
lively pen of my eldest daughter. ‘Here is all the town bizzing
with a fine piece of work,’ she writes, ‘and what would make the
thing more noted (if it were only known) the malefactor is a <em>protégée</em>
of his lordship my papa. I am sure your heart is too much in your
duty (if it were nothing else) to have forgotten Grey Eyes. What
does she do, but get a broad hat with the flaps open, a long hairy-like
man’s greatcoat, and a big gravatt; kilt her coats up to <em>Gude
kens whaur</em>, clap two pair of boot-hose upon her legs, take
a pair of <em>clouted brogues</em> [15] in her hand, and off to
the Castle! Here she gives herself out to be a soutar [16] in
the employ of James More, and gets admitted to his cell, the lieutenant
(who seems to have been full of pleasantry) making sport among
his soldiers of the soutar’s greatcoat. Presently they hear disputation
and the sound of blows inside. Out flies the cobbler, his coat
flying, the flaps of his hat beat about his face, and the lieutenant
and his soldiers mock at him as he runs off. They laughed no so
hearty the next time they had occasion to visit the cell and found
nobody but a tall, pretty, grey-eyed lass in the female habit!
As for the cobbler, he was ‘over the hills ayout Dumblane,’ and
it’s thought that poor Scotland will have to console herself without
him. I drank Catriona’s health this night in public. Indeed, the
whole town admires her; and I think the beaux would wear bits
of her garters in their button-holes if they could only get them.
I would have gone to visit her in prison too, only I remembered
in time I was papa’s daughter; so I wrote her a billet instead,
which I entrusted to the faithful Doig, and I hope you will admit
I can be political when I please. The same faithful gomeral is
to despatch this letter by the express along with those of the
wiseacres, so that you may hear Tom Fool in company with Solomon.
Talking of <em>gomerals</em>, do tell <em>Dauvit Balfour</em>.
I would I could see the face of him at the thought of a long-legged
lass in such a predicament; to say nothing of the levities of
your affectionate daughter, and his respectful friend.’ So my
rascal signs herself!" continued Prestongrange. "And you see,
Mr. David, it is quite true what I tell you, that my daughters
regard you with the most affectionate playfulness."</p>

<p>"The gomeral is much obliged," said I.</p>

<p>"And was not this prettily done!" he went on. "Is not this Highland
maid a piece of a heroine?"</p>

<p>"I was always sure she had a great heart," said I. "And I wager
she guessed nothing . . . But I beg your pardon, this is to tread
upon forbidden subjects."</p>

<p>"I will go bail she did not," he returned, quite openly. "I will
go bail she thought she was flying straight into King George’s
face."</p>

<p>Remembrance of Catriona and the thought of her lying in captivity,
moved me strangely. I could see that even Prestongrange admired,
and could not withhold his lips from smiling when he considered
her behaviour. As for Miss Grant, for all her ill habit of mockery,
her admiration shone out plain. A kind of a heat came on me.</p>

<p>"I am not your lordship’s daughter. . . " I began.</p>

<p>"That I know of!" he put in, smiling.</p>

<p>"I speak like a fool," said I; "or rather I began wrong. It would
doubtless be unwise in Mistress Grant to go to her in prison;
but for me, I think I would look like a half-hearted friend if
I did not fly there instantly."</p>

<p>"So-ho, Mr. David," says he; "I thought that you and I were in
a bargain?"</p>

<p>"My lord," I said, "when I made that bargain I was a good deal
affected by your goodness, but I’ll never can deny that I was
moved besides by my own interest. There was self-seeking in my
heart, and I think shame of it now. It may be for your lordship’s
safety to say this fashious Davie Balfour is your friend and housemate.
Say it then; I’ll never contradict you. But as for your patronage,
I give it all back. I ask but the one thing—let me go, and give
me a pass to see her in her prison."</p>

<p>He looked at me with a hard eye. "You put the cart before the
horse, I think," says he. "That which I had given was a portion
of my liking, which your thankless nature does not seem to have
remarked. But for my patronage, it is not given, nor (to be exact)
is it yet offered." He paused a bit. "And I warn you, you do not
know yourself," he added. "Youth is a hasty season; you will think
better of all this before a year."</p>

<p>"Well, and I would like to be that kind of youth!" I cried. "I
have seen too much of the other party in these young advocates
that fawn upon your lordship and are even at the pains to fawn
on me. And I have seen it in the old ones also. They are all for
by-ends, the whole clan of them! It’s this that makes me seem
to misdoubt your lordship’s liking. Why would I think that you
would like me? But ye told me yourself ye had an interest!"</p>

<p>I stopped at this, confounded that I had run so far; he was observing
me with an unfathomable face.</p>

<p>"My lord, I ask your pardon," I resumed. "I have nothing in my
chafts but a rough country tongue. I think it would be only decent-like
if I would go to see my friend in her captivity; but I’m owing
you my life—I’ll never forget that; and if it’s for your lordship’s
good, here I’ll stay. That’s barely gratitude."</p>

<p>"This might have been reached in fewer words," says Prestongrange
grimly. "It is easy, and it is at times gracious, to say a plain
Scots ‘ay’."</p>

<p>"Ah, but, my lord, I think ye take me not yet entirely!" cried
I. "For <em>your</em> sake, for my life-safe, and the kindness
that ye say ye bear to me—for these, I’ll consent; but not for
any good that might be coming to myself. If I stand aside when
this young maid is in her trial, it’s a thing I will be noways
advantaged by; I will lose by it, I will never gain. I would rather
make a shipwreck wholly than to build on that foundation."</p>

<p>He was a minute serious, then smiled. "You mind me of the man
with the long nose," said he; "was you to see the moon by a telescope
you would see David Balfour there! But you shall have your way
of it. I will ask at you one service, and then set you free: My
clerks are overdriven; be so good as copy me these few pages,
and when that is done, I shall bid you God speed! I would never
charge myself with Mr. David’s conscience; and if you could cast
some part of it (as you went by) in a moss hag, you would find
yourself to ride much easier without it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not just entirely in the same direction though, my lord!"
says I.</p>

<p>"And you shall have the last word, too!" cries he gaily.</p>

<p>Indeed, he had some cause for gaiety, having now found the means
to gain his purpose. To lessen the weight of the memorial, or
to have a readier answer at his hand, he desired I should appear
publicly in the character of his intimate. But if I were to appear
with the same publicity as a visitor to Catriona in her prison
the world would scarce stint to draw conclusions, and the true
nature of James More’s escape must become evident to all. This
was the little problem I had to set him of a sudden, and to which
he had so briskly found an answer. I was to be tethered in Glasgow
by that job of copying, which in mere outward decency I could
not well refuse; and during these hours of employment Catriona
was privately got rid of. I think shame to write of this man that
loaded me with so many goodnesses. He was kind to me as any father,
yet I ever thought him as false as a cracked bell.</p>
