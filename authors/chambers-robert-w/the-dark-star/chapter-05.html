<p>After she had become accustomed to the smell of rancid oil and
dyestuffs and the interminable racket of machinery she did not
find her work at the knitting mill disagreeable. It was like any
work, she imagined, an uninteresting task which had to be done.</p>

<p>The majority of the girls and young men of the village worked
there in various capacities; wages were fair, salaries better,
union regulations prevailed. There was nothing to complain of.</p>

<p>And nothing to expect except possible increase in wages, holidays,
and a disquieting chance of getting caught in the machinery, which
familiarity soon discounted.</p>

<p>As for the social status of the mill workers, the mill <em>was</em>
Gayfield; and Gayfield was a village where the simpler traditions
of the Republic still survived; where there existed no invidious
distinction in vocations; a typical old-time community harbouring
the remains of a Grand Army Post and too many churches of too
many denominations; where the chance metropolitan stranger was
systematically "done"; where distrust of all cities and desire
to live in them was equalled only by a passion for moving pictures
and automobiles; where the school trustees used double negatives
and traced their ancestry to Colonial considerables&mdash;who, however,
had signed their names in "lower case" or with a Maltese cross&mdash;the
world in miniature, with its due proportion of petty graft, petty
squabbles, envy, kindness, jealousy, generosity, laziness, ambition,
stupidity, intelligence, honesty, hypocrisy, hatred, affection,
badness and goodness, as standardised by the code established
according to folk-ways on earth&mdash;in brief, a perfectly human community
composed of the usual ingredients, worthy and unworthy&mdash;that was
Gayfield, Mohawk County, New York.</p>

<p>Before spring came&mdash;before the first robin appeared, and while
icy roads still lay icy under sunlit pools of snow-water&mdash;a whole
winter indoors, and a sedentary one, had changed the smoothly
tanned and slightly freckled cheeks of Rue Carew to a thinner
and paler oval. Under her transparent skin a tea-rose pink came
and went; under her grey eyes lay bluish shadows. Also, floating
particles of dust, fleecy and microscopic motes of cotton and
wool filling the air in the room where Ruhannah worked, had begun
to irritate her throat and bronchial tubes; and the girl developed
an intermittent cough.</p>

<p>When the first bluebird arrived in Gayfield the cough was no
longer intermittent; and her mother sent her to the village doctor.
So Rue Carew was transferred to the box factory adjoining, in
which the mill made its own paper boxes, where young women sat
all day at intelligent machines and fed them with squares of pasteboard
and strips of gilt paper; and the intelligent and grateful machines
responded by turning out hundreds and hundreds of complete boxes,
all neatly gilded, pasted, and labelled. And after a little while
Ruhannah was able to nourish one of these obliging and responsive
machines. And by July her cough had left her, and two delicate
freckles adorned the bridge of her nose.</p>

<p>The half-mile walk from and to Brookhollow twice a day was keeping
her from rapid physical degeneration. Yet, like all northern American
summers, the weather became fearfully hot in July and August,
and the half-mile even in early morning and at six in the evening
left her listless, nervously dreading the great concrete-lined
room, the reek of glue and oil, the sweaty propinquity of her
neighbours, and the monotonous appetite of the sprawling machine
which she fed all day long with pasteboard squares.</p>

<p>She went to her work in early morning, bareheaded, in a limp
pink dress very much open at the throat, which happened to be
the merciful mode of the moment&mdash;a slender, sweet-lipped thing,
beginning to move with grace now&mdash;and her chestnut hair burned
gold-pale by the sun.</p>

</div>
<p>There came that movable holiday in August, when the annual shutdown
for repairs closed the mill and box factory during forty-eight
hours&mdash;a matter of prescribing oil and new bearings for the overfed
machines so that their digestions should remain unimpaired and
their dispositions amiable.</p>

<p>It was a hot August morning, intensely blue and still, with that
slow, subtle concentration of suspended power in the sky, ominous
of thunder brooding somewhere beyond the western edges of the
world.</p>

<p>Ruhannah aided her mother with the housework, picked peas and
a squash and a saucer full of yellow pansies in the weedy little
garden, and, at noon, dined on the trophies of her husbandry,
physically and Ã¦sthetically.</p>

<p>After dinner, dishes washed and room tidied, she sat down on
the narrow, woodbine-infested verandah with pencil and paper,
and attempted to draw the stone bridge and the little river where
it spread in deeps and shallows above the broken dam.</p>

<p>Perspective was unknown to her; of classic composition she was
also serenely ignorant, so the absence of these in her picture
did not annoy her. On the contrary, there was something hideously
modern and recessional in her vigorous endeavour to include in
her drawing everything her grey eyes chanced to rest on. She even
arose and gently urged a cow into the already overcrowded composition,
and, having accomplished its portrait with Cezanne-like fidelity,
was beginning to look about for Adoniram to include him also,
when her mother called to her, holding out a pair of old gloves.</p>

<p>"Dear, we are going to save a little money this year. Do you
think you could catch a few fish for supper?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded, took the gloves, laid aside her pencil and paper,
picked up the long bamboo pole from the verandah floor, and walked
slowly out into the garden.</p>

<p>A trowel was sticking in the dry earth near the flower bed, where
poppies, and pansies, and petunias, and phlox bordered the walk.</p>

<p>Under a lilac the ground seemed moister and more promising for
vermicular investigation; she drew on her gloves, dug a few holes
with the trowel, extracted an angleworm, frowned slightly, holding
it between gloved fingers, regarding its contortions with pity
and aversion.</p>

<p>To bait a hook was not agreeable to the girl; she managed to
do it, however, then shouldering her pole she walked across the
road and down to the left, through rank grasses and patches of
milkweed, bergamot, and queen's lace, scattering a cloud of brown
and silver-spotted butterflies.</p>

<p>Alder, elder, and Indian willow barred her way; rank thickets
of jewelweed hung vivid blossoming drops across her path; woodbine
and clematis trailed dainty snares to catch her in their fairy
nets; a rabbit scurried out from behind the ruined paper mill
as she came to the swift, shallow water below the dam.</p>

<p>Into this she presently plumped her line, and the next instant
jerked it out again with a wriggling, silvery minnow flashing
on the hook.</p>

<p>Carrying her pole with its tiny, glittering victim dangling aloft,
Rue hastily retraced her steps to the road, crossed the bridge
to the further end, seated herself on the limestone parapet, and,
swinging her pole with both hands, cast line and hook and minnow
far out into the pond. It was a business she did not care for&mdash;this
extinguishing of the life-spark in anything. But, like her mill
work, it appeared to be a necessary business, and, so regarding
it, she went about it.</p>

<p>The pond above the half-ruined dam lay very still; her captive
minnow swam about with apparently no discomfort, trailing on the
surface of the pond above him the cork which buoyed the hook.</p>

<p>Rue, her pole clasped in both hands between her knees, gazed
with preoccupied eyes out across the water. On the sandy shore,
a pair of speckled tip-ups ran busily about, dipping and bobbing,
or spread their white, striped wings to sheer the still surface
of the pond, swing shoreward with bowed wings again, and resume
their formal, quaint, and busy manners.</p>

<p>From the interstices of the limestone parapet grew a white bluebell&mdash;the
only one Rue had ever seen. As long as she could remember it had
come up there every year and bloomed, snow-white amid a world
of its blue comrades in the grass below. She looked for it now,
saw it in bud&mdash;three sturdy stalks sprouting at right angles from
the wall and curving up parallel to it. Somehow or other she had
come to associate this white freak of nature with herself&mdash;she
scarcely knew why. It comforted her, oddly, to see it again, still
surviving, still delicately vigorous, though where among those
stone slabs it found its nourishment she never could imagine.</p>

<p>The intense blue of the sky had altered since noon; the west
became gradually duller and the air stiller; and now, over the
Gayfield hills, a tall cloud thrust up silvery-edged convolutions
toward a zenith still royally and magnificently blue.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>She had been sitting there watching her swimming cork for over
an hour when the first light western breeze arrived, spreading
a dainty ripple across the pond. Her cork danced, drifted; beneath
it she caught the momentary glimmer of the minnow; then the cork
was jerked under; she clasped the pole with all her strength,
struck upward; and a heavy pickerel, all gold and green, sprang
furiously from the water and fell back with a sharp splash.</p>

<p>Under the sudden strain of the fish she nearly lost her balance,
scrambled hastily down from the parapet, propping the pole desperately
against her body, and stood so, unbending, unyielding, her eyes
fixed on the water where the taut line cut it at forty-five degrees.</p>

<p>At the same time two men in a red runabout speeding westward
caught sight of the sharp turn by the bridge which the ruins of
the paper mill had hidden. The man driving the car might have
made it even then had he not seen Ruhannah in the centre of the
bridge. It was instantly all off; so were both mud-guards and
one wheel. So were driver and passenger, floundering on their
backs among the rank grass and wild flowers. Ruhannah, petrified,
still fast to her fish, gazed at the catastrophe over her right
shoulder.</p>

<p>A broad, short, squarely built man of forty emerged from the
weeds, went hastily to the car and did something to it. Noise
ceased; clouds of steam continued to ascend from the crumpled
hood.</p>

<p>The other man, even shorter, but slimmer, sauntered out of a
bed of milkweed whither he had been catapulted. He dusted with
his elbow a grey felt hat as he stood looking at the wrecked runabout;
his comrade, still clutching a cigar between his teeth, continued
to examine the car.</p>

<p>"Hell!" remarked the short, thickset man.</p>

<p>"It's going to rain like it, too," added the other. The thunder
boomed again beyond Gayfield hills.</p>

<p>"What do you know about this!" growled the thickset man, in utter
disgust. "Do we hunt for a garage, or what?"</p>

<p>"It's up to you, Eddie. And say! What was the matter with you?
Don't you know a bridge when you see one?"</p>

<p>"That damn girl&#11834;" He turned and looked at Ruhannah, who was
dragging the big flapping pickerel over the parapet by main strength.</p>

<p>The men scowled at her in silence, then the one addressed as
Eddie rolled his cigar grimly into the left corner of his jaw.</p>

<p>"Damn little skirt," he observed briefly. "It seems to worry
her a lot what she's done to us."</p>

<p>"I wonder does she know she wrecked us," suggested the other.
He was a stunted, wiry little man of thirty-five. His head seemed
slightly too large; he had a pasty face with the sloe-black eyes,
button nose, and the widely chiselled mouth of a circus clown.</p>

<p>The eyes of the short, thickset man were narrow and greyish green
in a round, smoothly shaven face. They narrowed still more as
the thunder broke louder from the west.</p>

<p>Ruhannah, dragging her fish over the grass, was coming toward
them; and the man called Eddie stepped forward to bar her progress.</p>

<p>"Say, girlie," he began, the cigar still tightly screwed into
his cheek, "is there a juice mill anywhere near us, d'y'know?"</p>

<p>"What?" said Rue.</p>

<p>"A garage."</p>

<p>"Yes; there is one at Gayfield."</p>

<p>"How far, girlie?"</p>

<p>Rue flushed, but answered:</p>

<p>"It is half a mile to Gayfield."</p>

<p>The other man, noticing the colour in Ruhannah's face, took off
his pearl-grey hat. His language was less grammatical than his
friend's, but his instincts were better.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said&mdash;his companion staring all the while at
the girl without the slightest expression. "Is there a telephone
in any of them houses, miss?"&mdash;glancing around behind him at the
three edifices which composed the crossroads called Brookhollow.</p>

<p>"No," said Rue.</p>

<p>It thundered again; the world around had become very dusky and
silent and the flash veined a rapidly blackening west.</p>

<p>"It's going to rain buckets," said the man called Eddie. "If
you live around here, can you let us come into your house till
it's over, gir&mdash;er&mdash;miss?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'm Mr. Brandes &mdash;Ed Brandes of New York&#11834;" speaking
through cigar-clutching teeth. "This is Mr. Ben Stull, of the
same.... It's raining already. Is that your house?"</p>

<p>"I live <em>there</em>," said Rue, nodding across the bridge.
"You may go in."</p>

<p>She walked ahead, dragging the fish; Stull went to the car, took
two suitcases from the boot; Brandes threw both overcoats over
his arm, and followed in the wake of Ruhannah and her fish.</p>

<p>"No Saratoga and no races today, Eddie," remarked Stull. But
Brandes' narrow, grey-green eyes were following Ruhannah.</p>

<p>"It's a pity," continued Stull, "somebody didn't learn you to
drive a car before you ask your friends joy-riding."</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;shut up," returned Brandes slowly, between his teeth.</p>

<p>They climbed the flight of steps to the verandah, through a rapidly
thickening gloom which was ripped wide open at intervals by lightning.</p>

<p>So Brandes and his shadow, Bennie Stull, came into the home of
Ruhannah Carew.</p>

<p>Her mother, who had observed their approach from the window,
opened the door.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Ruhannah, "here is the fish I caught&mdash;and two
gentlemen."</p>

<p>With which dubious but innocent explanation she continued on
toward the kitchen, carrying her fish.</p>

<p>Stull offered a brief explanation to account for their plight
and presence; Brandes, listening and watching the mother out of
greenish, sleepy eyes, made up his mind concerning her.</p>

<p>While the spare room was being prepared by mother and daughter,
he and Stull, seated in the sitting-room, their hats upon their
knees, exchanged solemn commonplaces with the Reverend Mr. Carew.</p>

<p>Brandes, always the gambler, always wary and reticent by nature,
did all the listening before he came to conclusions that relaxed
the stiffness of his attitude and the immobility of his large,
round face.</p>

<p>Then, at ease under circumstances and conditions which he began
to comprehend and have an amiable contempt for, he became urbane
and conversational, and a little amused to find navigation so
simple, even when out of his proper element.</p>

<p>From the book on the invalid's knees, Brandes took his cue; and
the conversation developed into a monologue on the present condition
of foreign missions&mdash;skilfully inspired by the respectful attention
and the brief and ingenious questions of Brandes.</p>

<p>"Doubtless," concluded the Reverend Mr. Carew, "you are familiar
with the life of the Reverend Adoniram Judson, Mr. Brandes."</p>

<p>It turned out to be Brandes' favourite book.</p>

<p>"You will recollect, then, the amazing conditions in India which
confronted Dr. Judson and his wife."</p>

<p>Brandes recollected perfectly&mdash;with a slow glance at Stull.</p>

<p>"All that is changed," said the invalid. " &mdash;God be thanked.
And conditions in Armenia are changing for the better, I hope."</p>

<p>"Let us hope so," returned Brandes solemnly.</p>

<p>"To doubt it is to doubt the goodness of the Almighty," said
the Reverend Mr. Carew. His dreamy eyes became fixed on the rain-splashed
window, burned a little with sombre inward light.</p>

<p>"In Trebizond," he began, "in my time&#11834;"</p>

<p>His wife came into the room, saying that the spare bedchamber
was ready and that the gentlemen might wish to wash before supper,
which would be ready in a little while.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>On their way upstairs they encountered Ruhannah coming down.
Stull passed with a polite grunt; Brandes ranged himself for the
girl to pass him.</p>

<p>"Ever so much obliged to you, Miss Carew," he said. "We have
put you to a great deal of trouble, I am sure."</p>

<p>Rue looked up surprised, shy, not quite understanding how to
reconcile his polite words and pleasant voice with the voice and
manner in which he had addressed her on the bridge.</p>

<p>"It is no trouble," she said, flushing slightly. "I hope you
will be comfortable."</p>

<p>And she continued to descend the stairs a trifle more hastily,
not quite sure she cared very much to talk to that kind of man.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>In the spare bedroom, whither Stull and Brandes had been conducted,
the latter was seated on the big and rather shaky maple bed, buttoning
a fresh shirt and collar, while Stull took his turn at the basin.
Rain beat heavily on the windows.</p>

<p>"Say, Ben," remarked Brandes, "you want to be careful when we
go downstairs that the old guy don't spot us for sporting men.
He's a minister, or something."</p>

<p>Stull lifted his dripping face of a circus clown from the basin.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I say we don't want to give the old people a shock. You know
what they'd think of us."</p>

<p>"What do I care what they think?"</p>

<p>"Can't you be polite?"</p>

<p>"I can be better than that; I can be honest," said Stull, drying
his sour visage with a flimsy towel.</p>

<p>After Brandes had tied his polka-dotted tie carefully before
the blurred mirror:</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" he asked stolidly.</p>

<p>"Ah &mdash;I know what I mean, Eddie. So do you. You're a smooth
talker, all right. You can listen and look wise, too, when there's
anything in it for you. Just see the way you got Stein to put
up good money for you! And all you done was to listen to him and
keep your mouth shut."</p>

<p>Brandes rose with an air almost jocular and smote Stull upon
the back.</p>

<p>"Stein thinks he's the greatest manager on earth. Let him tell
you so if you want anything out of him," he said, walking to the
window.</p>

<p>The volleys of rain splashing on the panes obscured the outlook;
Brandes flattened his nose against the glass and stood as though
lost in thought.</p>

<p>Behind him Stull dried his features, rummaged in the suitcase,
produced a bathrobe and slippers, put them on, and stretched himself
out on the bed.</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming down to buzz the preacher?" demanded Brandes,
turning from the drenched window.</p>

<p>"So you can talk phony to the little kid? No."</p>

<p>"Ah, get it out of your head that I mean phony."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>Stull gave him a contemptuous glance and turned over on the pillow.</p>

<p>"Are you coming down?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>So Brandes took another survey of himself in the glass, used
his comb and brushes again, added a studied twist to his tie,
shot his cuffs, and walked out of the room with the solid deliberation
which characterised his carriage at all times.</p>
