But in remembering the old life I have run ahead of my story into
the new life.  The wholesale jail delivery did not occur until well
along into 1915.  Complicated as it was, it was carried through
without a hitch, and as a very creditable achievement it cheered us
on in our work.  From Cuba to California, out of scores of jails,
military prisons, and fortresses, in a single night, we delivered
fifty-one of our fifty-two Congressmen, and in addition over three
hundred other leaders.  There was not a single instance of
miscarriage.  Not only did they escape, but every one of them won
to the refuges as planned.  The one comrade Congressman we did not
get was Arthur Simpson, and he had already died in Cabanas after
cruel tortures.
<P>
The eighteen months that followed was perhaps the happiest of my
life with Ernest.  During that time we were never apart.  Later,
when we went back into the world, we were separated much.  Not more
impatiently do I await the flame of to-morrow's revolt than did I
that night await the coming of Ernest.  I had not seen him for so
long, and the thought of a possible hitch or error in our plans
that would keep him still in his island prison almost drove me mad.
The hours passed like ages.  I was all alone.  Biedenbach, and
three young men who had been living in the refuge, were out and
over the mountain, heavily armed and prepared for anything.  The
refuges all over the land were quite empty, I imagine, of comrades
that night.
<P>
Just as the sky paled with the first warning of dawn, I heard the
signal from above and gave the answer.  In the darkness I almost
embraced Biedenbach, who came down first; but the next moment I was
in Ernest's arms.  And in that moment, so complete had been my
transformation, I discovered it was only by an effort of will that
I could be the old Avis Everhard, with the old mannerisms and
smiles, phrases and intonations of voice.  It was by strong effort
only that I was able to maintain my old identity; I could not allow
myself to forget for an instant, so automatically imperative had
become the new personality I had created.
<P>
Once inside the little cabin, I saw Ernest's face in the light.
With the exception of the prison pallor, there was no change in
him--at least, not much.  He was my same lover-husband and hero.
And yet there was a certain ascetic lengthening of the lines of his
face.  But he could well stand it, for it seemed to add a certain
nobility of refinement to the riotous excess of life that had
always marked his features.  He might have been a trifle graver
than of yore, but the glint of laughter still was in his eyes.  He
was twenty pounds lighter, but in splendid physical condition.  He
had kept up exercise during the whole period of confinement, and
his muscles were like iron.  In truth, he was in better condition
than when he had entered prison.  Hours passed before his head
touched pillow and I had soothed him off to sleep.  But there was
no sleep for me.  I was too happy, and the fatigue of jail-breaking
and riding horseback had not been mine.
<P>
While Ernest slept, I changed my dress, arranged my hair
differently, and came back to my new automatic self.  Then, when
Biedenbach and the other comrades awoke, with their aid I concocted
a little conspiracy.  All was ready, and we were in the cave-room
that served for kitchen and dining room when Ernest opened the door
and entered.  At that moment Biedenbach addressed me as Mary, and I
turned and answered him.  Then I glanced at Ernest with curious
interest, such as any young comrade might betray on seeing for the
first time so noted a hero of the Revolution.  But Ernest's glance
took me in and questioned impatiently past and around the room.
The next moment I was being introduced to him as Mary Holmes.
<P>
To complete the deception, an extra plate was laid, and when we sat
down to table one chair was not occupied.  I could have cried with
joy as I noted Ernest's increasing uneasiness and impatience.
Finally he could stand it no longer.
<P>
"Where's my wife?" he demanded bluntly.
<P>
"She is still asleep," I answered.
<P>
It was the crucial moment.  But my voice was a strange voice, and
in it he recognized nothing familiar.  The meal went on.  I talked
a great deal, and enthusiastically, as a hero-worshipper might
talk, and it was obvious that he was my hero.  I rose to a climax
of enthusiasm and worship, and, before he could guess my intention,
threw my arms around his neck and kissed him on the lips.  He held
me from him at arm's length and stared about in annoyance and
perplexity.  The four men greeted him with roars of laughter, and
explanations were made.  At first he was sceptical.  He scrutinized
me keenly and was half convinced, then shook his head and would not
believe.  It was not until I became the old Avis Everhard and
whispered secrets in his ear that none knew but he and Avis
Everhard, that he accepted me as his really, truly wife.
<P>
It was later in the day that he took me in his arms, manifesting
great embarrassment and claiming polygamous emotions.
<P>
"You are my Avis," he said, and you are also some one else.  You
are two women, and therefore you are my harem.  At any rate, we are
safe now.  If the United States becomes too hot for us, why I have
qualified for citizenship in Turkey."*
<P>
<P>
* At that time polygamy was still practised in Turkey.
<P>
<P>
Life became for me very happy in the refuge.  It is true, we worked
hard and for long hours; but we worked together.  We had each other
for eighteen precious months, and we were not lonely, for there was
always a coming and going of leaders and comrades--strange voices
from the under-world of intrigue and revolution, bringing stranger
tales of strife and war from all our battle-line.  And there was
much fun and delight.  We were not mere gloomy conspirators.  We
toiled hard and suffered greatly, filled the gaps in our ranks and
went on, and through all the labour and the play and interplay of
life and death we found time to laugh and love.  There were
artists, scientists, scholars, musicians, and poets among us; and
in that hole in the ground culture was higher and finer than in the
palaces of wonder-cities of the oligarchs.  In truth, many of our
comrades toiled at making beautiful those same palaces and wonder-
cities.*
<P>
<P>
* This is not braggadocio on the part of Avis Everhard.  The flower
of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists.  With
the exception of a few of the musicians and singers, and of a few
of the oligarchs, all the great creators of the period whose names
have come down to us, were revolutionists.
<P>
<P>
Nor were we confined to the refuge itself.  Often at night we rode
over the mountains for exercise, and we rode on Wickson's horses.
If only he knew how many revolutionists his horses have carried!
We even went on picnics to isolated spots we knew, where we
remained all day, going before daylight and returning after dark.
Also, we used Wickson's cream and butter,* and Ernest was not above
shooting Wickson's quail and rabbits, and, on occasion, his young
bucks.
<P>
<P>
* Even as late as that period, cream and butter were still crudely
extracted from cow's milk.  The laboratory preparation of foods had
not yet begun.
<P>
<P>
Indeed, it was a safe refuge.  I have said that it was discovered
only once, and this brings me to the clearing up of the mystery of
the disappearance of young Wickson.  Now that he is dead, I am free
to speak.  There was a nook on the bottom of the great hole where
the sun shone for several hours and which was hidden from above.
Here we had carried many loads of gravel from the creek-bed, so
that it was dry and warm, a pleasant basking place; and here, one
afternoon, I was drowsing, half asleep, over a volume of
Mendenhall.*  I was so comfortable and secure that even his flaming
lyrics failed to stir me.
<P>
<P>
* In all the extant literature and documents of that period,
continual reference is made to the poems of Rudolph Mendenhall.  By
his comrades he was called "The Flame."  He was undoubtedly a great
genius; yet, beyond weird and haunting fragments of his verse,
quoted in the writings of others, nothing of his has come down to
us.  He was executed by the Iron Heel in 1928 A.D.
<P>
<P>
I was aroused by a clod of earth striking at my feet.  Then from
above, I heard a sound of scrambling.  The next moment a young man,
with a final slide down the crumbling wall, alighted at my feet.
It was Philip Wickson, though I did not know him at the time.  He
looked at me coolly and uttered a low whistle of surprise.
<P>
"Well," he said; and the next moment, cap in hand, he was saying,
"I beg your pardon.  I did not expect to find any one here."
<P>
I was not so cool.  I was still a tyro so far as concerned knowing
how to behave in desperate circumstances.  Later on, when I was an
international spy, I should have been less clumsy, I am sure.  As
it was, I scrambled to my feet and cried out the danger call.
<P>
"Why did you do that?" he asked, looking at me searchingly.
<P>
It was evident that he had no suspicion of our presence when making
the descent.  I recognized this with relief.
<P>
"For what purpose do you think I did it?" I countered.  I was
indeed clumsy in those days.
<P>
"I don't know," he answered, shaking his head.  "Unless you've got
friends about.  Anyway, you've got some explanations to make.  I
don't like the look of it.  You are trespassing.  This is my
father's land, and--"
<P>
But at that moment, Biedenbach, every polite and gentle, said from
behind him in a low voice, "Hands up, my young sir."
<P>
Young Wickson put his hands up first, then turned to confront
Biedenbach, who held a thirty-thirty automatic rifle on him.
Wickson was imperturbable.
<P>
"Oh, ho," he said, "a nest of revolutionists--and quite a hornet's
nest it would seem.  Well, you won't abide here long, I can tell
you."
<P>
"Maybe you'll abide here long enough to reconsider that statement,"
Biedenbach said quietly.  "And in the meanwhile I must ask you to
come inside with me"
<P>
"Inside?"  The young man was genuinely astonished.  "Have you a
catacomb here?  I have heard of such things."
<P>
"Come and see," Biedenbach answered with his adorable accent.
<P>
"But it is unlawful," was the protest.
<P>
"Yes, by your law," the terrorist replied significantly.  "But by
our law, believe me, it is quite lawful.  You must accustom
yourself to the fact that you are in another world than the one of
oppression and brutality in which you have lived."
<P>
"There is room for argument there," Wickson muttered.
<P>
"Then stay with us and discuss it."
<P>
The young fellow laughed and followed his captor into the house.
He was led into the inner cave-room, and one of the young comrades
left to guard him, while we discussed the situation in the kitchen.
<P>
Biedenbach, with tears in his eyes, held that Wickson must die, and
was quite relieved when we outvoted him and his horrible
proposition.  On the other hand, we could not dream of allowing the
young oligarch to depart.
<P>
"I'll tell you what to do," Ernest said.  "We'll keep him and give
him an education."
<P>
"I bespeak the privilege, then, of enlightening him in
jurisprudence, Biedenbach cried.
<P>
And so a decision was laughingly reached.  We would keep Philip
Wickson a prisoner and educate him in our ethics and sociology.
But in the meantime there was work to be done.  All trace of the
young oligarch must be obliterated.  There were the marks he had
left when descending the crumbling wall of the hole.  This task
fell to Biedenbach, and, slung on a rope from above, he toiled
cunningly for the rest of the day till no sign remained.  Back up
the canyon from the lip of the hole all marks were likewise
removed.  Then, at twilight, came John Carlson, who demanded
Wickson's shoes.
<P>
The young man did not want to give up his shoes, and even offered
to fight for them, till he felt the horseshoer's strength in
Ernest's hands.  Carlson afterward reported several blisters and
much grievous loss of skin due to the smallness of the shoes, but
he succeeded in doing gallant work with them.  Back from the lip of
the hole, where ended the young man's obliterated trial, Carlson
put on the shoes and walked away to the left.  He walked for miles,
around knolls, over ridges and through canyons, and finally covered
the trail in the running water of a creek-bed.  Here he removed the
shoes, and, still hiding trail for a distance, at last put on his
own shoes.  A week later Wickson got back his shoes.
<P>
That night the hounds were out, and there was little sleep in the
refuge.  Next day, time and again, the baying hounds came down the
canyon, plunged off to the left on the trail Carlson had made for
them, and were lost to ear in the farther canyons high up the
mountain.  And all the time our men waited in the refuge, weapons
in hand--automatic revolvers and rifles, to say nothing of half a
dozen infernal machines of Biedenbach's manufacture.  A more
surprised party of rescuers could not be imagined, had they
ventured down into our hiding-place.
<P>
I have now given the true disappearance of Philip Wickson, one-time
oligarch, and, later, comrade in the Revolution.  For we converted
him in the end.  His mind was fresh and plastic, and by nature he
was very ethical.  Several months later we rode him, on one of his
father's horses, over Sonoma Mountains to Petaluma Creek and
embarked him in a small fishing-launch.  By easy stages we smuggled
him along our underground railway to the Carmel refuge.
<P>
There he remained eight months, at the end of which time, for two
reasons, he was loath to leave us.  One reason was that he had
fallen in love with Anna Roylston, and the other was that he had
become one of us.  It was not until he became convinced of the
hopelessness of his love affair that he acceded to our wishes and
went back to his father.  Ostensibly an oligarch until his death,
he was in reality one of the most valuable of our agents.  Often
and often has the Iron Heel been dumbfounded by the miscarriage of
its plans and operations against us.  If it but knew the number of
its own members who are our agents, it would understand.  Young
Wickson never wavered in his loyalty to the Cause.  In truth, his
very death was incurred by his devotion to duty.  In the great
storm of 1927, while attending a meeting of our leaders, he
contracted the pneumonia of which he died.*
<P>
<P>
* The case of this young man was not unusual.  Many young men of
the Oligarchy, impelled by sense of right conduct, or their
imaginations captured by the glory of the Revolution, ethically or
romantically devoted their lives to it.  In similar way, many sons
of the Russian nobility played their parts in the earlier and
protracted revolution in that country.
