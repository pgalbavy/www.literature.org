<p> "<em>YES, </em>my friends," he used to say to his guests, "what
would you have? A youth of seventeen summers, without worldly
experience, and owing my rank only to the glorious patriotism
of my father, may God rest his soul, I suffered immense humiliation,
not so much from the disobedience of That subordinate, who, alter
all, was responsible for those prisoners; but I suffered because,
like the boy I was, I myself dreaded going to the adjutant for
the key. I had felt, before, his rough and cutting tongue. Being
quite a common fellow, with no merit except his savage valour,
he made me feel his contempt and dislike from the first day I
joined my battalion in garrison at the fort. It was only a fortnight
before! I would have confronted him sword in hand, but I shrank
from the mocking brutality of his sneers.</p>

<p>"I don’t remember having been so miserable in my life before
or since. The torment of my sensibility was so great that I wished
the sergeant to fall dead at my feet, and the stupid soldiers
who stared at me to turn into corpses; and even those wretches
for whom my entreaties had procured a reprieve I wished dead also,
because I could not face them without shame. A mephitic heat like
a whiff of air from hell came out of that dark place in which
they were confined. Those at the window who heard what was going
on jeered at me in very desperation; one of these fellows, gone
mad no doubt, kept on urging me volubly to order the soldiers
to fire through the window. His insane loquacity made my heart
turn faint. And my feet were like lead. There was no higher officer
to whom I could appeal. I had not even the firmness of spirit
to simply go away.</p>

<p>"Benumbed by my remorse, I stood with my back to the window.
You must not suppose that all this lasted a long time. How long
could it have been? A minute? If you measured by mental suffering
it was like a hundred years; a longer time than all my life has
been since. No, certainly, it was not so much as a minute. The
hoarse screaming of those miserable wretches died out in their
dry throats, and then suddenly a voice spoke, a deep voice muttering
calmly. It called upon me to turn round.</p>

<p>"That voice, senores, proceeded from the head of Gaspar Ruiz.
Of his body I could see nothing. Some of his fellow-captives had
clambered upon his back. He was holding them up. His eyes blinked
without looking at me. That and the moving of his lips was all
he seemed able to manage in his overloaded state. And when I turned
round, this head, that seemed more than human size resting on
its chin under a multitude of other heads, asked me whether I
really desired to quench the thirst of the captives.</p>

<p>"I said, ‘Yes, yes!’ eagerly, and came up quite close to the
window. I was like a child, and did not know what would happen.
I was anxious to be comforted in my helplessness and remorse.</p>

<p>"‘Have you the authority, senor teniente, to release my wrists
from their bonds?’ Gaspar Ruiz’s head asked me.</p>

<p>"His features expressed no anxiety, no hope; his heavy eyelids
blinked upon his eyes that looked past me straight into the courtyard.</p>

<p>"As if in an ugly dream, I spoke, stammering: ‘What do you mean?
And how can I reach the bonds on your wrists?’</p>

<p>"‘I will try what I can do,’ he said; and then that large staring
head moved at last, and all the wild faces piled up in that window
disappeared, tumbling down. He had shaken his load off with one
movement, so strong he was.</p>

<p>"And he had not only shaken it off, but he got free of the crush
and vanished from my sight. For a moment there was no one at all
to be seen at the window. He had swung about, butting and shouldering,
clearing a space for himself in the only way he could do it with
his hands tied behind his back.</p>

<p>"Finally, backing to the opening, he pushed out to me between
the bars his wrists, lashed with many turns of rope. His hands,
very swollen, with knotted veins, looked enormous and unwieldy.
I saw his bent back. It was very broad. His voice was like the
muttering of a bull.</p>

<p>"Cut, senor teniente! Cut!’</p>

<p>"I drew my sword, my new unblunted sword that had seen no service
as yet, and severed the many turns of the hide rope. I did this
without knowing the why and the wherefore of my action, but as
it were compelled by my faith in that man. The sergeant made as
if to cry out, but astonishment deprived him of his voice, and
he remained standing with his mouth open as if overtaken by sudden
imbecility.</p>

<p>"I sheathed my sword and faced the soldiers. An air of awestruck
expectation had replaced their usual listless apathy. I heard
the voice of Gaspar Ruiz shouting inside, but the words I could
not make out plainly. I suppose that to see him with his arms
free augmented the influence of his strength: I mean by this,
the spiritual influence that with ignorant people attaches to
an exceptional degree of bodily vigour. In fact, he was no more
to be feared than before, on account of the numbness of his arms
and hands, which lasted for some time.</p>

<p>"The sergeant had recovered his power of speech. ‘By all the
saints!’ he cried, ‘we shall have to get a cavalry man with a
lasso to secure him again, if he is to be led to the place of
execution. Nothing less than a good enlazador on a good horse
can subdue him. Your worship was pleased to perform a very mad
thing.’</p>

<p>"I had nothing to say. I was surprised myself, and I felt a childish
curiosity to see what would happen. But the sergeant was thinking
of the difficulty of controlling Gaspar Ruiz when the time for
making an example would come.</p>

<p>"‘Or perhaps,’ the sergeant pursued vexedly, ‘we shall be obliged
to shoot him down as he dashes out when the door is opened.’ He
was going to give further vent to his anxieties as to the proper
carrying out of the sentence; but he interrupted himself with
a sudden exclamation, snatched a musket from a soldier, and stood
watchful with his eyes fixed on the window.’"</p>
