<p>The patient, an old-fashioned man, thought the nurse made a mistake
in keeping both of the windows open, and her sprightly disregard
of his protests added something to his hatred of her. Every evening
he told her that anybody with ordinary gumption ought to realize
that night air was bad for the human frame. "The human frame won't
stand everything, Miss Perry," he warned her, resentfully. "Even
a child, if it had just ordinary gumption, ought to know enough
not to let the night air blow on sick people yes, nor well people,
either! 'Keep out of the night air, no matter how well you feel.'
That's what my mother used to tell me when I was a boy. 'Keep
out of the night air, Virgil,' she'd say. 'Keep out of the night
air.'"</p>

<p>"I expect probably her mother told her the same thing," the nurse
suggested.</p>

<p>"Of course she did. My grandmother&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess your GRANDmother thought so, Mr. Adams! That was
when all this flat central country was swampish and hadn't been
drained off yet. I guess the truth must been the swamp mosquitoes
bit people and gave 'em malaria, especially before they began
to put screens in their windows. Well, we got screens in these
windows, and no mosquitoes are goin' to bite us; so just you be
a good boy and rest your mind and go to sleep like you need to."</p>

<p>"Sleep?" he said. "Likely!"</p>

<p>He thought the night air worst of all in April; he hadn't a doubt
it would kill him, he declared. "It's miraculous what the human
frame <em>WILL </em>survive," he admitted on the last evening
of that month. "But you and the doctor ought to both be taught
it won't stand too dang much! You poison a man and poison and
poison him with this April night air&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Can't poison you with much more of it," Miss Perry interrupted
him, indulgently. "To-morrow it'll be May night air, and I expect
that'll be a lot better for you, don't you? Now let's just sober
down and be a good boy and get some nice sound sleep."</p>

<p>She gave him his medicine, and, having set the glass upon the
center table, returned to her cot, where, after a still interval,
she snored faintly. Upon this, his expression became that of a
man goaded out of overpowering weariness into irony.</p>

<p>"Sleep? Oh, <em>CERTAINLY, </em>thank you!"</p>

<p>However, he did sleep intermittently, drowsed between times,
and even dreamed; but, forgetting his dreams before he opened
his eyes, and having some part of him all the while aware of his
discomfort, he believed, as usual, that he lay awake the whole
night long. He was conscious of the city as of some single great
creature resting fitfully in the dark outside his windows. It
lay all round about, in the damp cover of its night cloud of smoke,
and tried to keep quiet for a few hours after midnight, but was
too powerful a growing thing ever to lie altogether still. Even
while it strove to sleep it muttered with digestions of the day
before, and these already merged with rumblings of the morrow.
"Owl" cars, bringing in last passengers over distant trolley-lines,
now and then howled on a curve; faraway metallic stirrings could
be heard from factories in the sooty suburbs on the plain outside
the city; east, west, and south, switch-engines chugged and snorted
on sidings; and everywhere in the air there seemed to be a faint,
voluminous hum as of innumerable wires trembling overhead to vibration
of machinery underground.</p>

<p>In his youth Adams might have been less resentful of sounds such
as these when they interfered with his night's sleep: even during
an illness he might have taken some pride in them as proof of
his citizenship in a "live town"; but at fifty-five he merely
hated them because they kept him awake. They "pressed on his nerves,"
as he put it; and so did almost everything else, for that matter.</p>

<p>He heard the milk-wagon drive into the cross-street beneath his
windows and stop at each house. The milkman carried his jars round
to the "back porch," while the horse moved slowly ahead to the
gate of the next customer and waited there. "He's gone into Pollocks',"
Adams thought, following this progress. "I hope it'll sour on
'em before breakfast. Delivered the Andersons'. Now he's getting
out ours. Listen to the darn brute! What's HE care who wants to
sleep!" His complaint was of the horse, who casually shifted weight
with a clink of steel shoes on the worn brick pavement of the
street, and then heartily shook himself in his harness, perhaps
to dislodge a fly far ahead of its season. Light had just filmed
the windows; and with that the first sparrow woke, chirped instantly,
and roused neighbours in the trees of the small yard, including
a loud-voiced robin. Vociferations began irregularly, but were
soon unanimous.</p>

<p>"Sleep? Dang likely now, ain't it!"</p>

<p>Night sounds were becoming day sounds; the far-away hooting of
freight-engines seemed brisker than an hour ago in the dark. A
cheerful whistler passed the house, even more careless of sleepers
than the milkman's horse had been; then a group of coloured workmen
came by, and although it was impossible to be sure whether they
were homeward bound from night-work or on their way to day-work,
at least it was certain that they were jocose. Loose, aboriginal
laughter preceded them afar, and beat on the air long after they
had gone by.</p>

<p>The sick-room night-light, shielded from his eyes by a newspaper
propped against a water-pitcher, still showed a thin glimmering
that had grown offensive to Adams. In his wandering and enfeebled
thoughts, which were much more often imaginings than reasonings,
the attempt of the night-light to resist the dawn reminded him
of something unpleasant, though he could not discover just what
the unpleasant thing was. Here was a puzzle that irritated him
the more because he could not solve it, yet always seemed just
on the point of a solution. However, he may have lost nothing
cheerful by remaining in the dark upon the matter; for if he had
been a little sharper in this introspection he might have concluded
that the squalor of the night-light, in its seeming effort to
show against the forerunning of the sun itself, had stimulated
some half-buried perception within him to sketch the painful little
synopsis of an autobiography.</p>

<p>In spite of noises without, he drowsed again, not knowing that
he did; and when he opened his eyes the nurse was just rising
from her cot. He took no pleasure in the sight, it may be said.
She exhibited to him a face mismodelled by sleep, and set like
a clay face left on its cheek in a hot and dry studio. She was
still only in part awake, however, and by the time she had extinguished
the night-light and given her patient his tonic, she had recovered
enough plasticity. "Well, isn't that grand! We've had another
good night," she said as she departed to dress in the bathroom.</p>

<p>"Yes, you had another!" he retorted, though not until after she
had closed the door.</p>

<p>Presently he heard his daughter moving about in her room across
the narrow hall, and so knew that she had risen. He hoped she
would come in to see him soon, for she was the one thing that
didn't press on his nerves, he felt; though the thought of her
hurt him, as, indeed, every thought hurt him. But it was his wife
who came first.</p>

<p>She wore a lank cotton wrapper, and a crescent of gray hair escaped
to one temple from beneath the handkerchief she had worn upon
her head for the night and still retained; but she did everything
possible to make her expression cheering.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're better again! I can see that, as soon as I look at
you," she said. "Miss Perry tells me you've had another splendid
night."</p>

<p>He made a sound of irony, which seemed to dispose unfavourably
of Miss Perry, and then, in order to be more certainly intelligible,
he added, "She slept well, as usual!"</p>

<p>But his wife's smile persisted. "It's a good sign to be cross;
it means you're practically convalescent right now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am, am I?"</p>

<p>"No doubt in the world!" she exclaimed. "Why, you're practically
a well man, Virgil&mdash;all except getting your strength back, of
course, and that isn't going to take long. You'll be right on
your feet in a couple of weeks from now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I will?"</p>

<p>"Of course you will!" She laughed briskly, and, going to the
table in the center of the room, moved his glass of medicine an
inch or two, turned a book over so that it lay upon its other
side, and for a few moments occupied herself with similar futilities,
having taken on the air of a person who makes things neat, though
she produced no such actual effect upon them. "Of course you will,"
she repeated, absently. "You'll be as strong as you ever were;
maybe stronger." She paused for a moment, not looking at him,
then added, cheerfully, "So that you can fly around and find something
really good to get into."</p>

<p>Something important between them came near the surface here,
for though she spoke with what seemed but a casual cheerfulness,
there was a little betraying break in her voice, a trembling just
perceptible in the utterance of the final word. And she still
kept up the affectation of being helpfully preoccupied with the
table, and did not look at her husband&mdash;perhaps because they had
been married so many years that without looking she knew just
what his expression would be, and preferred to avoid the actual
sight of it as long as possible. Meanwhile, he stared hard at
her, his lips beginning to move with little distortions not lacking
in the pathos of a sick man's agitation.</p>

<p>"So that's it," he said. "That's what you're hinting at."</p>

<p>"'Hinting?'" Mrs. Adams looked surprised and indulgent. "Why,
I'm not doing any hinting, Virgil."</p>

<p>"What did you say about my finding 'something good to get into?'"
he asked, sharply. "Don't you call that hinting?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams turned toward him now; she came to the bedside and
would have taken his hand, but he quickly moved it away from her.</p>

<p>"You mustn't let yourself get nervous," she said. "But of course
when you get well there's only one thing to do. You mustn't go
back to that old hole again."</p>

<p>"'Old hole?' That's what you call it, is it?" In spite of his
weakness, anger made his voice strident, and upon this stimulation
she spoke more urgently.</p>

<p>"You just mustn't go back to it, Virgil. It's not fair to any
of us, and you know it isn't."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me what I know, please!"</p>

<p>She clasped her hands, suddenly carrying her urgency to plaintive
entreaty. "Virgil, you <em>WON'T </em>go back to that hole?"</p>

<p>"That's a nice word to use to me!" he said. "Call a man's business
a hole!"</p>

<p>"Virgil, if you don't owe it to me to look for something different,
don't you owe it to your children? Don't tell me you won't do
what we all want you to, and what you know in your heart you ought
to! And if you <em>HAVE </em>got into one of your stubborn fits
and are bound to go back there for no other reason except to have
your own way, don't tell me so, for I can't bear it!"</p>

<p>He looked up at her fiercely. "You've got a fine way to cure
a sick man!" he said; but she had concluded her appeal&mdash;for that
time&mdash;and instead of making any more words in the matter, let
him see that there were tears in her eyes, shook her head, and
left the room.</p>

<p>Alone, he lay breathing rapidly, his emaciated chest proving
itself equal to the demands his emotion put upon it. "Fine!" he
repeated, with husky indignation. "Fine way to cure a sick man!
Fine!" Then, after a silence, he gave forth whispering sounds
as of laughter, his expression the while remaining sore and far
from humour.</p>

<p>"And give us our daily bread!" he added, meaning that his wife's
little performance was no novelty.</p>
