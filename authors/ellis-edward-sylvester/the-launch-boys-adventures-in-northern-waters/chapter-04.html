<p>Suddenly the <em>Water Witch's</em> whistle sent out a series
of piping toots.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of that?" asked Chester of Detective Calvert,
who had quietly resumed his seat in one of the wicker chairs in
front of the youth.</p>

<p>"It's a challenge to a race."</p>

<p>"I accept it," said Alvin, with a flash of his eyes. At the same
moment he swung the wheel over and began circling out to the left,
so as to turn in the shortest possible space. "If that boat can
outrun me I want to know it."</p>

<p>"Be keerful ye don't run over him," cautioned Mike, catching
the excitement, "as Tam McMurray said whin he started to overtake
a locomotive."</p>

<p>Alvin quickly hit up the pace of the launch, which sped down
the Sheepscot with so sudden a burst of speed that all felt the
impulse. The sharp bow cut the current like a knife, the water
curving over in a beautiful arch on each side and foaming away
from the churning screw. Even with the wind-shield they caught
the impact of the breeze, caused by their swiftness, and each
was thrilled by the battle for mastery.</p>

<p>"Are you doing your best?" asked Calvert, watching the actions
of the youthful Captain.</p>

<p>"No; I am making about two-thirds of the other's speed."</p>

<p>"Then don't do any better, is my advice," said the detective.</p>

<p>Alvin glanced over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It may be wise at this stage of the game not to let them know
that you can surpass them. Wait till the necessity arises."</p>

<p>"I agree with Mr. Calvert," added Chester, and the Captain was
impressed by the logic of the counsel. He was on the point of
increasing the pace, but refrained. In truth he was already wondering
what they would do if they overtook the other and what could be
gained by passing the boat.</p>

<p>Again the whistle piped several times and it was evident that
the fugitive, as it may be called, had "put on more steam."</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to let her get away from us?" asked Alvin.</p>

<p>"Not for the present, but that may be the best course. Hold your
own for awhile and then gradually fall back."</p>

<p>When the race opened, less than an eighth of a mile separated
the contestants. The abrupt burst lessened this slightly and then
it appeared to be stationary as the two glided down the river.</p>

<p>Such were the relative positions when the <em>Water Witch</em>
shot past Ram Island, holding the middle of the stream, and a
few minutes later came abreast of Isle of Springs.</p>

<p>"Those two young fellows have a man with them," remarked Calvert.
"He tried to keep out of sight when we first met, but now he doesn't
seem to care. You can see him plainly without the help of the
glasses."</p>

<p>Such was the fact, and Chester said:</p>

<p>"They must know that we also have a friend with us."</p>

<p>"I don't see that it matters either way. I think you are gaining."</p>

<p>"But not half fast enough," added Mike, who was standing and
impatient to beat their opponent. "We must come up wid the spalpeens
before they git to Boothbay."</p>

<p>"They are not heading for Boothbay," observed Calvert, whose
keen eyes had detected the change in the line of flight. His companions
saw he was right. The front boat had made so abrupt a change of
course that it was almost at right angles to that of the pursuer.
The side of the launch was exposed, showing the two youths, one
of whom held the wheel, while the man with a mustache sat directly
beside the other. It might be said of the two craft and their
crews that they were twins, so marked was their resemblance.</p>

<p>Naturally Alvin shifted his line of pursuit. You may recall that,
opposite the Isle of Springs, Goose Rock Passage connects Sheepscot
River with Knubble Bay, which leads into Montsweag Bay, reaching
northward on the western side of the long island of Westport.
In their first trip northward our young friends had gone to the
eastward of Westport, as they had been doing during this race.
Montsweag Bay takes the name of Back River at the northern end
of the island and that and the Sheepscot unite above before reaching
Wiscasset.</p>

<p>The <em>Water Witch</em> dived into Goose Neck Passage past Newdick
Point, where it turned northward into Knubble Bay. This is the
path taken by the steamers from Bath and other places on the Kennebec
when going to Boothbay Harbor, Squirrel Island and other points.
To the westward of these bodies of water sweeps the noble Kennebec
to the sea.</p>

<p>Just ahead was discerned a swiftly approaching mass of tumbling
water, above which the deck, pilot house and puffing smokestack
of a little steamer showed. This was the "pony of the Kennebec"&mdash;the
<em>Gardiner</em>, plowing ahead in such desperate haste that
one might well believe the fate of a score of persons depended
upon its not losing a half minute. Alvin took good care to give
her plenty of room and saluted with several whistle toots. There
was no reply. The captain merely glanced at the two craft and
sped onward like an arrow from the bow of the hunter.</p>

<p>The <em>Deerfoot</em> rocked and plunged in the swell made by
the steamer, which, spreading out like a fan from its bow, ran
tumbling and foaming along the rocky shores, keeping pace with
the headlong charge of the boat, and trying to engulf everything
in its path. One small catboat that was tied to a rickety, home-made
landing, after a couple of dives capsized, as if it were a giant
flapjack under which a housewife had slid her turning iron.</p>

<p>"They're gaining!" exclaimed Chester, who was closely watching
the progress of the racers. "Do you mean to let them get away,
Alvin?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Calvert will answer that question."</p>

<p>"I do so by advising that you neither gain nor lose for the present."</p>

<p>The Captain gave the launch a little more power, and it became
clear to all that the pursuer was picking up the ground, or rather
water, that she had lost. Then for several minutes no difference
in speed was perceptible. A space of a furlong separated the two
when they shot past the point of land bearing the odd name of
Thomas Great Toe, which is on the western side of the lower part
of Westport, some two miles above Goose Neck Passage. Here the
water is a mile in width, and is filled with islands of varying
sizes, until the large bay to the northward is reached.</p>

<p>The <em>Water Witch</em> persisted in hugging the eastern shore,
while her pursuer kept well out, as if to make sure of having
plenty of room in which to pass her, when the chance came. But
all the same the chance did not come. It was soon seen that the
fugitive was drawing away from her pursuer. Mike Murphy fumed,
but held his peace.</p>

<p>"It's mesilf that hasn't any inflooence here," he reflected,
"as I obsarved to mysilf whin dad and mither agreed that a thundering
big licking was due me."</p>

<p>"Can you overhaul her?" asked Detective Calvert.</p>

<p>"Easiest thing in the world; I can shoot past her as if she were
lying still."</p>

<p>"Well, don't do it."</p>

<p>Mike could remain silent no longer.</p>

<p>"That's a dooce of a way to run a race! Whin ye find ye can bate
the ither out of sight ye fall back and let her doot. That's the
style I used to run races wid the ither boys at school, but the
raison was I couldn't help it. If ye'll allow me to utter a few
words of wisdom I'll do the same."</p>

<p>Alvin nodded his head.</p>

<p>"It is that ye signal to that pirut ahead to wait and give us
a tow, being that's the only way we can howld our own wid 'em."</p>

<p>Now while it was trying to Alvin and Chester to engage in a race
of the nature described and voluntarily allow the contestant to
beat them, when they knew they had the power of winning, yet they
believed it was the true policy, since Detective Calvert had said
so. They understood the disgust of Mike and could not forbear
having a little fun at his expense.</p>

<p>"You see," said Chester gravely, "those two young men who gave
you and Alvin such a warm time the other night are on the other
boat, and if we should come to close quarters with them they would
be pretty sure to even up matters with you."</p>

<p>Mike glared at the speaker, as if doubting the evidence of his
ears.</p>

<p>"Phwat is that ye're saying?" he demanded. "Isn't that the dearest
object of yer heart? I shall niver die contint till I squar' matters
wid 'em, and ye knows the same."</p>

<p>"You forget," added Calvert, with the same seriousness, "that
they have a full-grown man to help them out."</p>

<p>"And haven't we a full-grown man wid us, as me dad said whin
he inthrodooced me to his friends at Donnybrook, I being 'liven
years old? Begorra, I'm thinking we haven't any such person on
boord."</p>

<p>It was a pretty sharp retort, but the officer could not repress
his amusement at the angry words. Alvin looked over his shoulder
and winked at Calvert and Chester, making sure that Mike did not
observe the signal. In his impatience, he had turned his back
upon them and was looking gloomily over the stern at the foaming
wake.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there isn't some tub along the shore that'll put
out and run us down. I hope, Captain, that whin we git back home
ye'll kaap this a secret from dad."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"He'll sure give me the greatest walloping of me life."</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>"For consoorting wid a party that run away from the finest chance
in the wurrld for a shindy. It's a sin that can be wiped out in
no ither way."</p>

<p>"I'll explain to him," said Calvert, "that you couldn't help
yourself."</p>

<p>"And it's mighty little difference that will make, as Terry McCarthy
said when he had the ch'ice of foighting two Tipperary byes or
three Corkonians."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't your father prefer to have us bring you home safe and
unhurt rather than to have your beauty battered out of you?" inquired
the detective, with a solemn visage.</p>

<p>Mike, who had risen to his feet and was still staring over the
stern, slowly turned and faced the questioner. Then, with an expression
of contempt, he said:</p>

<p>"Ye haven't the honor of an acquaintance wid me dad."</p>
