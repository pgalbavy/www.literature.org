<p>Peter Rabbit is one of the kindest hearted little people of the
Green Forest or the Green Meadows. He is happy-go-lucky, and his
dreadful curiosity is forever getting him into all kinds of trouble.
Perhaps it is because he has been in so many scrapes himself that
he always feels sorry for others who get into trouble. Anyway,
no sooner does Peter hear of some one in trouble, than he begins
to wonder how he can help them. So just as soon as he found out
for himself that Sammy Jay had told the truth about Chatterer
the Red Squirrel, and that Chatterer really was in a prison at
Farmer Brown's house, he began to think and think to find some
way to help Chatterer.</p>

<p>Now of course Peter didn't know what kind of a prison Chatterer
was in. He remembered right away how Prickly Porky the Porcupine
had gnawed a great hole in the box in which Johnny Chuck's lost
baby was kept by Farmer Brown's boy. Why shouldn't Prickly Porky
do as much for Chatterer? He would go see him at once. The trouble
with Peter is that he doesn't think of all sides of a question.
He is impulsive. That is, he goes right ahead and does the thing
that comes into his head first, and sometimes this isn't the wisest
or best thing to do. So now he scampered down into the Green Forest
as fast as his long legs would carry him, to hunt for Prickly
Porky. It was no trouble at all to find him, for he had only to
follow the line of trees that had been stripped of their bark.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Prickly Porky. Have you heard the news about
Chatterer?" said Peter, talking very fast, for he was quite out
of breath.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Prickly Porky. "Serves him right. I hope it will
teach him a lesson."</p>

<p>Peter's heart sank. "Don't you think it is dreadful?" he asked.
"Just think, he will never, never be able to run and play in the
Green Forest again, unless we can get him out."</p>

<p>"So much the better," grunted Prickly Porky. "So much the better.
He always was a nuisance. Never did see such a fellow for making
trouble for other people. No, Sir, I never did. The rest of us
can have some peace now. Serves him right." Prickly Porky went
on chewing bark as if Chatterer's trouble was no concern of his.</p>

<p>Peter's heart sank lower still. He scratched one long ear slowly
with a long hind foot, which is a way he has when he is thinking
very hard. He was so busy thinking that he didn't see the twinkle
in the dull little eyes of Prickly Porky, who really was not so
hard-hearted as his words sounded. After a long time, during which
Peter thought and thought, and Prickly Porky ate and ate, the
latter spoke again.</p>

<p>"What have you got on your mind, Peter?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I was just thinking how perfectly splendid it would
be if you would go up there and gnaw a way out of his prison for
Chatterer," replied Peter timidly.</p>

<p>"Huh!" grunted Prickly Porky. "Huh! Some folks think my wits
are pretty slow, but even I know better than that. Put on your
thinking cap again, Peter Rabbit."</p>

<p>"Why can't you? You are not afraid of Bowser the Hound or Farmer
Brown's boy, and everybody else is, excepting Jimmy Skunk," persisted
Peter.</p>

<p>"For the very good reason that if I could gnaw into his prison,
Chatterer could gnaw out. If he can't gnaw his way out with those
sharp teeth of his, I certainly can't gnaw in. Where's your common
sense, Peter Rabbit?"</p>

<p>"That's so. I hadn't thought of that," replied Peter slowly and
sorrowfully. "I must try to think of some other way to help Chatterer."</p>

<p>"I'd be willing to try if it was of any use. But it isn't," said
Prickly Porky, who didn't want Peter to think that he really was
as hard-hearted as he had seemed at first.</p>

<p>Illustration: "I'd be willing to try it if it was of any use.
But it isn't," said Prickly Porky.</p>

<p>So Peter bade Prickly Porky good-by and started for the dear
old Briar-patch to try to think of some other way to help Chatterer.
On the way he waked up Unc' Billy Possum and Bobby Coon, but they
couldn't give him any help. "There really doesn't seem to be any
way I can help," sighed Peter. And there really wasn't.</p>
