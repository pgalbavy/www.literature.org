<P>
While the train was stopping at the provincial town, Sergey
Ivanovitch did not go to the refreshment-room, but walked up and
down the platform.
<P>
The first time he passed Vronsky's compartment he noticed that
the curtain was drawn over the window; but as he passed it the
second time he saw the old countess at the window. She beckoned
to Koznishev.
<P>
"I'm going, you see, taking him as far as Kursk," she said.
<P>
"Yes, so I heard," said Sergey Ivanovitch, standing at her window
and peeping in. "What a noble act on his partl" he added,
noticing that Vronsky was not in the compartment.
<P>
"Yes, after his misfortune, what was there for him to do?"
<P>
"What a terrible thing it was!" said Sergey Ivanovitch.
<P>
"Ah, what I have been through! But do get in.... Ah, what I have
been through!" she repeated, when Sergey Ivanovitch had got in
and sat down beside her. "You can't conceive it! For six weeks he
did not speak to any one, and would not touch food except when I
implored him. And not for one minute could we leave him alone. We
took away everything he could have used against himself. We lived
on the ground-floor, but there was no reckoning on anything. You
know, of course, that he had shot himself once already on her
account," she said, and the old lady's eyelashes twitched at the
recollection. "Yes, hers was the fitting end for such a woman.
Even the death she chose was low and vulgar."
<P>
"It's not for us to judge, countess," said Sergey Ivanovitch;
"but I can understand that it has been very hard for you."
<P>
"Ah, don't speak of it! I was staying on my estate, and he was
with me. A note was brought him. He wrote an answer and sent it
off. We hadn't an idea that she was close by at the station. In
the evening I had only just gone to my room, when my Mary told me
a lady had thrown herself under the train. Something seemed to
strike me at once. I knew it was she. The first thing I said was,
he was not to be told. But they'd told him already. His coachman
was there and saw it all. When I ran into his room, he was beside
himself--it was fearful to see him. He didn't say a word, but
galloped off there. I don't know to this day what happened there,
but he was brought back at death's door. I shouldn't have known
him. Prostration complete, the doctor said. And that was followed
almost by madness. Oh, why talk of it!" said the countess with a
wave of her hand. "It was an awful time! No, say what you will,
she was a bad woman. Why, what is the meaning of such desperate
passions? It was all to show herself something out of the way.
Well, and that she did do. She brought herself to ruin and two
good men--her husband and my unhappy son."
<P>
"And what did her husband do?" asked Sergey Ivanovitch.
<P>
"He has taken her daughter. Alexey was ready to agree to anything
at first. Now it worries him terribly that he should have given
his own child away to another man. But he can't take back his
word. Karenin came to the funeral. But we tried to prevent his
meeting Alexey. For him, for her husband, it was easier, anyway.
She had set him free. But my poor son was utterly given up to
her. He had thrown up everything, his career, me, and even then
she had no mercy on him, but of set purpose she made his ruin
complete. No, say what you will, her very death was the death of
a vile woman, of no religious feeling. God forgive me, but I
can't help hating the memory of her, when I look at my son's
misery!"
<P>
"But how is he now?"
<P>
"It was a blessing from Providence for us--this Servian war. I'm
old, and I donit understand the rights and wrongs of it, but it's
come as a providential blessing to him. Of course for me, as his
mother, it's terrible; and what's worse, they say, ce n'est pas
tres bien vu a Petersbourg. But it can't be helped! It was the
one thing that could rouse him. Yashvin--a friend of his--he had
lost all he had at cards and he was going to Servia. He came to
see him and persuaded him to go. Now it's an interest for him. Do
please talk to him a little. I want to distract his mind. He's so
low-spirited. And as bad luck would have it, he has toothache
too. But he'll be delighted to see you. Please do talk to him;
he's walking up and down on that side."
<P>
Sergey Ivanovitch said he would be very glad to, and crossed over
to the other side of the station.
