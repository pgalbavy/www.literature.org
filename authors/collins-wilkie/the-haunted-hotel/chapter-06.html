<P>
<P>
The next day, the friend and legal adviser of Agnes Lockwood,
Mr. Troy, called on her by appointment in the evening.
<P>
Mrs. Ferrari--still persisting in the conviction of her husband's death--
had sufficiently recovered to be present at the consultation.
Assisted by Agnes, she told the lawyer the little that was
known relating to Ferrari's disappearance, and then produced
the correspondence connected with that event.  Mr. Troy read
(first) the three letters addressed by Ferrari to his wife;
(secondly) the letter written by Ferrari's courier-friend,
describing his visit to the palace and his interview with
Lady Montbarry; and (thirdly) the one line of anonymous writing
which had accompanied the extraordinary gift of a thousand pounds
to Ferrari's wife.
<P>
Well known, at a later period, as the lawyer who acted for Lady Lydiard,
in the case of theft, generally described as the case of 'My Lady's Money,'
Mr. Troy was not only a man of learning and experience in his profession--
he was also a man who had seen something of society at home and abroad.
He possessed a keen eye for character, a quaint humour, and a kindly
nature which had not been deteriorated even by a lawyer's professional
experience of mankind.  With all these personal advantages, it is
a question, nevertheless, whether he was the fittest adviser whom
Agnes could have chosen under the circumstances.  Little Mrs. Ferrari,
with many domestic merits, was an essentially commonplace woman.
Mr. Troy was the last person living who was likely to attract
her sympathies--he was the exact opposite of a commonplace man.
<P>
'She looks very ill, poor thing!'  In these words the lawyer
opened the business of the evening, referring to Mrs. Ferrari
as unceremoniously as if she had been out of the room.
<P>
'She has suffered a terrible shock,' Agnes answered.
<P>
Mr. Troy turned to Mrs. Ferrari, and looked at her again,
with the interest due to the victim of a shock.  He drummed absently
with his fingers on the table.  At last he spoke to her.
<P>
'My good lady, you don't really believe that your husband is dead?'
<P>
Mrs. Ferrari put her handkerchief to her eyes.  The word 'dead' was
ineffectual to express her feelings.  'Murdered!' she said sternly,
behind her handkerchief.
<P>
'Why?  And by whom?'  Mr. Troy asked.
<P>
Mrs. Ferrari seemed to have some difficulty in answering.
'You have read my husband's letters, sir,' she began.  'I believe
he discovered--' She got as far as that, and there she stopped.
<P>
'What did he discover?'
<P>
There are limits to human patience--even the patience of a bereaved wife.
This cool question irritated Mrs. Ferrari into expressing herself
plainly at last.
<P>
'He discovered Lady Montbarry and the Baron!' she answered,
with a burst of hysterical vehemence.  'The Baron is no more
that vile woman's brother than I am.  The wickedness of those two
wretches came to my poor dear husband's knowledge.  The lady's maid
left her place on account of it.  If Ferrari had gone away too,
he would have been alive at this moment.  They have killed him.
I say they have killed him, to prevent it from getting to Lord
Montbarry's ears.'  So, in short sharp sentences, and in louder
and louder accents, Mrs. Ferrari stated her opinion of the case.
<P>
Still keeping his own view in reserve, Mr. Troy listened
with an expression of satirical approval.
<P>
'Very strongly stated, Mrs. Ferrari,' he said.  'You build up your
sentences well; you clinch your conclusions in a workmanlike manner.
If you had been a man, you would have made a good lawyer--
you would have taken juries by the scruff of their necks.
Complete the case, my good lady--complete the case.
Tell us next who sent you this letter, enclosing the bank-note.
The "two wretches" who murdered Mr. Ferrari would hardly put
their hands in their pockets and send you a thousand pounds.
Who is it--eh?  I see the post-mark on the letter is "Venice."
Have you any friend in that interesting city, with a large heart,
and a purse to correspond, who has been let into the secret and who wishes
to console you anonymously?'
<P>
It was not easy to reply to this.  Mrs. Ferrari began to feel
the first inward approaches of something like hatred towards Mr. Troy.
'I don't understand you, sir,' she answered.  'I don't think this is
a joking matter.'
<P>
Agnes interfered, for the first time.  She drew her chair a little
nearer to her legal counsellor and friend.
<P>
'What is the most probable explanation, in your opinion?'
she asked.
<P>
'I shall offend Mrs. Ferrari if I tell you,' Mr. Troy answered.
<P>
'No, sir, you won't!' cried Mrs. Ferrari, hating Mr. Troy
undisguisedly by this time.
<P>
The lawyer leaned back in his chair.  'Very well,' he said, in his
most good-humoured manner.  'Let's have it out.  Observe, madam,
I don't dispute your view of the position of affairs at the palace
in Venice.  You have your husband's letters to justify you;
and you have also the significant fact that Lady Montbarry's
maid did really leave the house.  We will say, then, that Lord
Montbarry has presumably been made the victim of a foul wrong--
that Mr. Ferrari was the first to find it out--and that the guilty
persons had reason to fear, not only that he would acquaint Lord
Montbarry with his discovery, but that he would be a principal witness
against them if the scandal was made public in a court of law.
Now mark!  Admitting all this, I draw a totally different
conclusion from the conclusion at which you have arrived.
Here is your husband left in this miserable household of three,
under very awkward circumstances for him.  What does he do?
But for the bank-note and the written message sent to you with it,
I should say that he had wisely withdrawn himself from association
with a disgraceful discovery and exposure, by taking secretly to flight.
The money modifies this view--unfavourably so far as Mr. Ferrari
is concerned.  I still believe he is keeping out of the way.  But I
now say he is paid for keeping out of the way--and that bank-note there
on the table is the price of his absence, sent by the guilty persons to
his wife.'
<P>
Mrs. Ferrari's watery grey eyes brightened suddenly; Mrs. Ferrari's
dull drab-coloured complexion became enlivened by a glow of brilliant red.
<P>
'It's false!' she cried.  'It's a burning shame to speak of my
husband in that way!'
<P>
'I told you I should offend you!' said Mr. Troy.
<P>
Agnes interposed once more--in the interests of peace.  She took
the offended wife's hand; she appealed to the lawyer to reconsider
that side of his theory which reflected harshly on Ferrari.
While she was still speaking, the servant interrupted her by entering
the room with a visiting-card. It was the card of Henry Westwick;
and there was an ominous request written on it in pencil.
'I bring bad news.  Let me see you for a minute downstairs.'
Agnes immediately left the room.
<P>
Alone with Mrs. Ferrari, Mr. Troy permitted his natural kindness
of heart to show itself on the surface at last.  He tried to make
his peace with the courier's wife.
<P>
'You have every claim, my good soul, to resent a reflection cast upon
your husband,' he began.  'I may even say that I respect you for speaking
so warmly in his defence.  At the same time, remember, that I am bound,
in such a serious matter as this, to tell you what is really in my mind.
I can have no intention of offending you, seeing that I am a total
stranger to you and to Mr. Ferrari.  A thousand pounds is a large
sum of money; and a poor man may excusably be tempted by it
to do nothing worse than to keep out of the way for a while.
My only interest, acting on your behalf, is to get at the truth.
If you will give me time, I see no reason to despair of finding your
husband yet.'
<P>
Ferrari's wife listened, without being convinced:  her narrow little mind,
filled to its extreme capacity by her unfavourable opinion of Mr. Troy,
had no room left for the process of correcting its first impression.
'I am much obliged to you, sir,' was all she said.  Her eyes were
more communicative--her eyes added, in their language, 'You may say
what you please; I will never forgive you to my dying day.'
<P>
Mr. Troy gave it up.  He composedly wheeled his chair around,
put his hands in his pockets, and looked out of window.
<P>
After an interval of silence, the drawing-room door was opened.
<P>
Mr. Troy wheeled round again briskly to the table, expecting to see Agnes.
To his surprise there appeared, in her place, a perfect stranger to him--
a gentleman, in the prime of life, with a marked expression of pain
and embarrassment on his handsome face.  He looked at Mr. Troy,
and bowed gravely.
<P>
'I am so unfortunate as to have brought news to Miss Agnes Lockwood
which has greatly distressed her,' he said.  'She has retired to her room.
I am requested to make her excuses, and to speak to you in her place.'
<P>
Having introduced himself in those terms, he noticed Mrs. Ferrari,
and held out his hand to her kindly.  'It is some years since we
last met, Emily,' he said.  'I am afraid you have almost forgotten
the "Master Henry" of old times.'  Emily, in some little confusion,
made her acknowledgments, and begged to know if she could be of any
use to Miss Lockwood.  'The old nurse is with her,' Henry answered;
'they will be better left together.'  He turned once more to Mr. Troy.
'I ought to tell you,' he said, 'that my name is Henry Westwick.  I am
the younger brother of the late Lord Montbarry.'
<P>
'The late Lord Montbarry!'  Mr. Troy exclaimed.
<P>
'My brother died at Venice yesterday evening.  There is the telegram.'
With that startling answer, he handed the paper to Mr. Troy.
<P>
The message was in these words:
<P>
'Lady Montbarry, Venice.  To Stephen Robert Westwick,
Newbury's Hotel, London.  It is useless to take the journey.
Lord Montbarry died of bronchitis, at 8.40 this evening.
All needful details by post.'
<P>
'Was this expected, sir?' the lawyer asked.
<P>
'I cannot say that it has taken us entirely by surprise, Henry answered.
'My brother Stephen (who is now the head of the family) received a
telegram three days since, informing him that alarming symptoms had
declared themselves, and that a second physician had been called in.
He telegraphed back to say that he had left Ireland for London,
on his way to Venice, and to direct that any further message
might be sent to his hotel.  The reply came in a second telegram.
It announced that Lord Montbarry was in a state of insensibility,
and that, in his brief intervals of consciousness, he recognised nobody.
My brother was advised to wait in London for later information.
The third telegram is now in your hands.  That is all I know, up to the
present time.'
<P>
Happening to look at the courier's wife, Mr. Troy was struck
by the expression of blank fear which showed itself in the woman's face.
<P>
'Mrs. Ferrari,' he said, 'have you heard what Mr. Westwick has
just told me?'
<P>
'Every word of it, sir.'
<P>
'Have you any questions to ask?'
<P>
'No, sir.'
<P>
'You seem to be alarmed,' the lawyer persisted.  'Is it still
about your husband?'
<P>
'I shall never see my husband again, sir.  I have thought so all along,
as you know.  I feel sure of it now.'
<P>
'Sure of it, after what you have just heard?'
<P>
'Yes, sir.'
<P>
'Can you tell me why?'
<P>
'No, sir.  It's a feeling I have.  I can't tell why.'
<P>
'Oh, a feeling?'  Mr. Troy repeated, in a tone of compassionate contempt.
'When it comes to feelings, my good soul--!' He left the sentence
unfinished, and rose to take his leave of Mr. Westwick.  The truth is,
he began to feel puzzled himself, and he did not choose to let
Mrs. Ferrari see it.  'Accept the expression of my sympathy, sir,'
he said to Mr. Westwick politely.  'I wish you good evening.'
<P>
Henry turned to Mrs. Ferrari as the lawyer closed the door.
'I have heard of your trouble, Emily, from Miss Lockwood.  Is there
anything I can do to help you?'
<P>
'Nothing, sir, thank you.  Perhaps, I had better go home after
what has happened?  I will call to-morrow, and see if I can be of
any use to Miss Agnes.  I am very sorry for her.'  She stole away,
with her formal curtsey, her noiseless step, and her obstinate
resolution to take the gloomiest view of her husband's case.
<P>
Henry Westwick looked round him in the solitude of the little drawing-room.
There was nothing to keep him in the house, and yet he lingered in it.
It was something to be even near Agnes--to see the things belonging
to her that were scattered about the room.  There, in the corner,
was her chair, with her embroidery on the work-table by its side.
On the little easel near the window was her last drawing, not quite
finished yet.  The book she had been reading lay on the sofa,
with her tiny pencil-case in it to mark the place at which she
had left off.  One after another, he looked at the objects that
reminded him of the woman whom he loved--took them up tenderly--
and laid them down again with a sigh.  Ah, how far, how unattainably
far from him, she was still!  'She will never forget Montbarry,'
he thought to himself as he took up his hat to go.  'Not one of us
feels his death as she feels it.  Miserable, miserable wretch--how she
loved him!'
<P>
In the street, as Henry closed the house-door, he was stopped
by a passing acquaintance--a wearisome inquisitive man--
doubly unwelcome to him, at that moment.  'Sad news, Westwick,
this about your brother.  Rather an unexpected death, wasn't it?
We never heard at the club that Montbarry's lungs were weak.
What will the insurance offices do?'
<P>
Henry started; he had never thought of his brother's life insurance.
What could the offices do but pay?  A death by bronchitis, certified by
two physicians, was surely the least disputable of all deaths.  'I wish
you hadn't put that question into my head!' he broke out irritably.
'Ah!' said his friend, 'you think the widow will get the money?
So do I! so do I!'
