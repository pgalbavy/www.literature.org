<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Next morning we came into Clearwater Glen.</p>

<p>Shalah spoke to me of it before we started. He did not fear the
Cherokees, who had come from the far south of the range and had
never been settled in these parts. But he thought that there might
be others from the back of the hills who would have crossed by
this gap, and might be lying in the lower parts of the glen. It
behoved us, therefore, to go very warily. Once on the higher ridges,
he thought we might be safe for a time. An invading army has no
leisure to explore the rugged summits of a mountain.</p>

<p>The first sight of the place gave me a strong emotion of dislike.
A little river brawled in a deep gorge, falling in pools and linns
like one of my native burns. All its course was thickly shaded
with bushes and knotted trees. On either bank lay stretches of
rough hill pasture, lined with dark and tangled forests, which
ran up the hill-side till the steepness of the slope broke them
into copses of stunted pines among great bluffs of rock and raw
red scaurs. The glen was very narrow, and the mountains seemed
to beetle above it so as to shut out half the sunlight. The air
was growing cooler, with the queer, acrid smell in it that high
hills bring. I am a great lover of uplands, and the sourest peat-moss
has a charm for me, but to that strange glen I conceived at once
a determined hate. It is the way of some places with some men.
The senses perceive a hostility for which the mind has no proof,
and in my experience the senses are right.</p>

<p>Part of my discomfort was due to my bodily health. I had proudly
thought myself seasoned by those hot Virginian summers, in which
I had escaped all common ailments. But I had forgotten what old
hunters had told me, that the hills will bring out a fever which
is dormant in the plains. Anyhow, I now found that my head was
dizzy and aching, and my limbs had a strange trembling. The fatigue
of the past day had dragged me to the limits of my strength and
made me an easy victim. My heart, too, was full of cares. The
sight of Elspeth reminded me how heavy was my charge. 'Twas difficult
enough to scout well in this tangled place, but, forbye my duty
to the dominion, I had the business of taking one who was the
light of my life into this dark land of bloody secrets.</p>

<p>The youth and gaiety were going out of my quest. I could only
plod along dismally, attentive to every movement of Shalah, praying
incessantly that we might get well out of it all. To make matters
worse, the travelling became desperate hard. In the Tidewater
there were bridle paths, and in the vales of the foothills the
going had been good, with hard, dry soil in the woods, and no
hindrances save a thicket of vines or a rare windfall. But in
this glen, where the hill rains beat, there was no end to obstacles.
The open spaces were marshy, where our horses sank to the hocks.
The woods were one medley of fallen trees, rotting into touchwood,
hidden boulders, and matted briers. Often we could not move till
Donaldson and Bertrand with their hatchets had hewn some sort
of road. All this meant slow progress, and by midday we had not
gone half-way up the glen to the neck which meant the ridge of
the pass.</p>

<p>This was an occasion when Ringan showed at his best. He had lost
his awe of Elspeth, and devoted himself to making the road easy
for her. Grey, who would fain have done the same, was no match
for the seafarer, and had much ado to keep going himself. Ringan's
cheery face was better than medicine. His eyes never lost their
dancing light, and he was ready ever with some quip or whimsy
to tide over the worst troubles. We kept very still, but now and
again Elspeth's laugh rang out at his fooling, and it did my heart
good to hear it.</p>

<p>After midday the glen seemed to grow darker, and I saw that the
blue sky, which I had thought changeless, was becoming overcast.
As I looked upwards I saw the high ridge blotted out and a white
mist creeping down. I had noticed for some time that Shalah was
growing uneasy. He would halt us often, while he went a little
way on, and now he turned with so grim a look that we stopped
without bidding.</p>

<p>He slipped into the undergrowth, while we waited in that dark,
lonesome place. Even Ringan was sober now.</p>

<p>Elspeth asked in a low voice what was wrong, and I told her that
the Indian was uncertain of the best road.</p>

<p>"Best road!" she laughed. "Then pray show me what you call the
worst."</p>

<p>Ringan grinned at me ruefully. "Where do you wish yourself at
this moment, Andrew?"</p>

<p>"On the top of this damned mountain," I grunted.</p>

<p>"Not for me," he said. "Give me the Dry Tortugas, on a moonlight
night when the breaming fires burn along the shore, and the lads
are singing 'Spanish Ladies.' Or, better still, the little isle
of St. John the Baptist, with the fine yellow sands for careening,
and Mother Daria brewing bobadillo and the trades blowing fresh
in the tops of the palms. This land is a gloomy sort of business.
Give me the bright, changeful sea."</p>

<p>"And I," said Elspeth, "would be threading rowan berries for
a necklace in the heather of Medwyn Glen. It must be about four
o'clock of a midsummer afternoon and a cloudless sky, except for
white streamers over Tinto. Ah, my own kind countryside!"</p>

<p>Ringan's face changed.</p>

<p>"You are right, my lady. No Tortugas or Spanish isles for Ninian
Campbell. Give him the steeps of Glenorchy on an October morn
when the deer have begun to bell. My sorrow, but we are far enough
from our desires&mdash;all but Andrew, who is a prosaic soul. And here
comes Shalah with ugly news!"</p>

<p>The Indian spoke rapidly to me. "The woods are full of men. I
do not think we are discovered, but we cannot stay here. Our one
hope is to gain the cover of the mist. There is an open space
beyond this thicket, and we must ride our swiftest. Quick, brother."</p>

<p>"The men?" I gasped. "Cherokees?"</p>

<p>"Nay," he said, "not Cherokees. I think they are those you seek
from beyond the mountains."</p>

<p>The next half-hour is a mad recollection, wild and confused,
and distraught with anxiety. The thought of Elspeth among savages
maddened me, the more so as she had just spoken of Medwyn Glen,
and had sent my memory back to fragrant hours of youth. We scrambled
out of the thicket and put our weary beasts to a gallop. Happily
it was harder ground, albeit much studded with clumps of fern,
and though we all slipped and stumbled often, the horses kept
their feet. I was growing so dizzy in the head that I feared every
moment I would fall off. The mist had now come low down the hill,
and lay before us, a line, of grey vapour drawn from edge to edge
of the vale. It seemed an infinite long way off.</p>

<p>Shalah on foot kept in the rear, and I gathered from him that
the danger he feared was behind. Suddenly as I stared ahead something
fell ten yards in advance of us in a long curve, and stuck, quivering
in the soil.</p>

<p>It was an Indian arrow.</p>

<p>We would have reined up if Shalah had not cried on us to keep
on. I do not think the arrow was meant to strike us. 'Twas a warning,
a grim jest of the savages in the wood.</p>

<p>Then another fell, at the same distance before our first rider.</p>

<p>Still Shalah cried us on. I fell back to the rear, for if we
were to escape I thought there might be need of fighting there.
I felt in my belt for my loaded pistols.</p>

<p>We were now in a coppice again, where the trees were short and
sparse. Beyond that lay another meadow, and, then, not a quarter-mile
distant, the welcome line of the mist, every second drawing down
on us.</p>

<p>A third time an arrow fell. Its flight was shorter and dropped
almost under the nose of Elspeth's horse, which swerved violently,
and would have unseated a less skilled horsewoman.</p>

<p>"On, on," I cried, for we were past the need for silence, and
when I looked again, the kindly fog had swallowed up the van of
the party.</p>

<p>I turned and gazed back, and there I saw a strange sight. A dozen
men or more had come to the edge of the trees on the hill-side.
They were quite near, not two hundred yards distant, and I saw
them clearly. They carried bows or muskets, but none offered to
use them. They were tall fellows, but lighter in the colour than
any Indians I had seen. Indeed, they were as fair as many an Englishman,
and their slim, golden-brown bodies were not painted in the maniac
fashion of the Cherokees. They stood stock still, watching us
with a dreadful impassivity which was more frightening to me than
violence. Then I, too, was overtaken by the grey screen.</p>

<p>"Will they follow?" I asked Shalah.</p>

<p>"I do not think so. They are not hill-men, and fear the high
places where the gods smoke. Further-more, there is no need."</p>

<p>"We have escaped, then?" I asked, with a great relief in my voice.</p>

<p>"Say rather we have been shepherded by them into a fold. They
will find us when they desire us."</p>

<p>It was a perturbing thought, but at any rate we were safe for
the moment, and I resolved to say nothing to alarm the others.
We overtook them presently, and Shalah became our guide. Not that
more guiding was needed than Ringan or I could have given, for
the lift of the ground gave us our direction, and there was the
sound of a falling stream. To an upland-bred man mist is little
of a hindrance, unless on a featureless moor.</p>

<p>Ever as we jogged upward the air grew colder. Rain was blowing
in our teeth, and the ferny grass and juniper clumps dripped with
wet. Almost it might have been the Pentlands or the high mosses
between Douglas Water and Clyde. To us coming fresh from the torrid
plains it was bitter weather, and I feared for Elspeth, who was
thinly clad for the hill-tops. Ringan seemed to feel the cold
the worst of us, for he had spent his days in the hot seas of
the south. He put his horse-blanket over his shoulders, and cut
a comical figure with his red face peeping from its folds.</p>

<p>"Lord," he would cry, "I wish I was in the Dry Tortugas or snug
in the beach-house at the Isle o' Pines. This minds me painfully
of my young days, when I ran in a ragged kilt in the cold heather
of Cruachan. I must be getting an old man, Andrew, for I never
thought the hills could freeze my blood."</p>

<p>Suddenly the fog lightened a little, the slope ceased, and we
had that gust of freer air which means the top of the pass. My
head was less dizzy now, and I had a momentary gladness that at
any rate we had done part of what we set out to do.</p>

<p>"Clearwater Gap!" I cried. "Except for old Studd, we are the
first Christians to stand on this watershed."</p>

<p>Below us lay a swimming hollow of white mist, hiding I knew not
what strange country.</p>

<p>From the vales below I had marked the lie of the land on each
side of the gap. The highest ground was to the right, so we turned
up the ridge, which was easier than the glen and better travelling.
Presently we were among pines again, and got a shelter from the
driving rain. My plan was to find some hollow far up the mountain
side, and there to make our encampment. After an hour's riding,
we came to the very place I had sought. A pocket of flat land
lay between two rocky knolls, with a ring of good-sized trees
around it. The spot was dry and hidden, and what especially took
my fancy was a spring of water which welled up in the centre,
and from which a tiny stream ran down the hill. 'Twas a fine site
for a stockade, and so thought Shalah and the two Borderers.</p>

<p>There was much to do to get the place ready, and Donaldson and
Bertrand fell to with their axes to fell trees for the fort. Now
that we had reached the first stage in our venture, my mind was
unreasonably comforted. With the buoyancy of youth, I argued that
since we had got so far we must get farther. Also the fever seemed
to be leaving my bones and my head clearing. Elspeth was almost
merry. Like a child playing at making house, she ordered the men
about on divers errands. She was a fine sight, with the wind ruffling
her hair and her cheeks reddened from the rain.</p>

<p>Ringan came up to me. "There are three Hours of daylight in front
of us. What say you to make for the top of the hills and find
Studd's cairn? I need some effort to keep my blood running."</p>

<p>I would gladly have stayed behind, for the fever had tired me,
but I could not be dared by Ringan and not respond. So we set
off at a great pace up the ridge, which soon grew very steep,
and forced us to a crawl. There were places where we had to scramble
up loose cliffs amid a tangle of vines, and then we would dip
into a little glade, and then once again breast a precipice. By
and by the trees dropped away, and there was nothing but low bushes
and boulders and rank mountain grasses. In clear air we must have
had a wonderful prospect, but the mist hung close around us, the
drizzle blurred our eyes, and the most we saw was a yard or two
of grey vapour. It was easy enough to find the road, for the ridge
ran upwards as narrow as a hog's back.</p>

<p>Presently it ceased, and with labouring breath we walked a step
or two in flat ground. Ringan, who was in front, stumbled over
a little heap of stones about a foot high.</p>

<p>"Studd had a poor notion of a cairn," he said, as he kicked them
down. There was nothing beneath but bare soil.</p>

<p>But the hunter had spoken the truth. A little digging in the
earth revealed the green metal of an old powder-flask with a wooden
stopper. I forced it open, and shook from its inside a twist of
very dirty paper. There were some rude scratchings on it with
charcoal, which I read with difficulty.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>Somehow in that bleak place this scrap of a human message wonderfully
uplifted our hearts. Before we had thought only of our danger
and cares, but now we had a vision of the reward. Down in the
mists lay a new world. Studd had seen it, and we should see it;
and some day the Virginian people would drive a road through Clearwater
Gap and enter into possession. It is a subtle joy that which fills
the heart of the pioneer, and mighty unselfish too. He does not
think of payment, for the finding is payment enough. He does not
even seek praise, for it is the unborn generations that will call
him blessed. He is content, like Moses, to leave his bones in
the wilderness if his people may pass over Jordan.</p>

<p>Ringan turned his flask in his hands. "A good man, this old Studd,"
he said. "I like his words, <em>Salute to Adventurers</em>. He
was thinking of the folk that should come after him, which is
the mark of a big mind, Andrew. Your common fellow would have
writ some glorification of his own doings, but Studd was thinking
of the thing he had done and not of himself. You say he's dead
these ten years. Maybe he's looking down at us and nodding his
old head well pleased. I would like fine to drink his health."</p>

<p>We ran down the hill, and came to the encampment at the darkening.
Ringan, who had retained the flask, presented it to Elspeth with
a bow.</p>

<p>"There, mistress," he says, "there's the key of your new estate."</p>
