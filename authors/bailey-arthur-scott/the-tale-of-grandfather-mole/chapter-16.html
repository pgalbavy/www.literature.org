<p>WHATEVER Grandfather Mole's neighbors might say of him, they never could
claim that he was lazy. He was always busy. When he wasn't eating or
sleeping you could be quite sure that he was digging. He never seemed to
be satisfied with his house, but was forever making what he called
"improvements." If there was one thing he liked, it was plenty of halls.
He had halls running in every direction. And since a person could never
tell in which one Grandfather Mole might be, visitors might roam about
his dark galleries a long time without finding him.
</p>
<p>If anybody happened to point out to Grandfather Mole that his house had
such a drawback, Grandfather Mole always answered that he liked his
house just as it was and that he wouldn't change it for anything--except
to add a few more halls.
</p><p>He was very set in his ways. He claimed that he wouldn't be comfortable
in a house that had maybe only two halls--a front and a back one, as
Billy Woodchuck's dwelling was known to contain.
</p><p>Maybe that was the reason why Grandfather Mole never went visiting. And
as for anybody else visiting him--well, what was the use when most
likely you never could find him?
</p><p>Nevertheless there was one of Grandfather Mole's neighbors who called at
his house frequently, and for the very reason that he knew he could
probably do exactly as he pleased. Far from trying to find Grandfather
Mole, Mr. Meadow Mouse always took pains to avoid him. And if by chance
he met Grandfather Mole in one of his galleries Mr. Meadow Mouse was
always extremely polite--and ready to run at a moment's notice.
</p><p>During corn-planting time Mr. Meadow Mouse went regularly down into a
gallery of Grandfather Mole's that ran under a corner of the cornfield.
And somehow he soon grew quite plump.
</p><p>Now, Grandfather Mole had met Mr. Meadow Mouse two or three times in
that particular gallery. And he was not slow to notice that his visitor
looked fatter each time he saw him. So one day Grandfather Mole asked
Mr. Meadow Mouse bluntly what he was doing there.
</p><p>"I'm taking a stroll!" Mr. Meadow Mouse told him meekly.
</p><p>"Be careful"--Grandfather Mole warned him--"be careful that you don't
take anything else!"
</p><p>Trembling slightly (for Grandfather Mole could be terribly severe when
he wanted to be) Mr. Meadow Mouse said that he hoped Grandfather Mole
didn't mind if a person took a little exercise now and then in those
underground halls. "On a warm summer's day it's delightfully cool down
here," Mr. Meadow Mouse murmured.
</p><p>His speech pleased Grandfather Mole.
</p><p>"I'm glad there's some one that agrees with me!" he exclaimed. "Most
people think I'm queer because I like to live underground."
</p><p>Mr. Meadow Mouse hastened to assure him that <u>he</u> didn't think him
queer--not in the least!
</p><p>"Thank you! Thank you!" Grandfather Mole said. "And since you're a
person of more sense than I had supposed you're welcome to ramble
through my halls--so long as you don't take anything except exercise and
a stroll."
</p><p>Then it was Mr. Meadow Mouse's turn to thank Grandfather Mole.
</p><p>"I feel better," he said, "now that you've given me permission to come
here. For to tell the truth, I've often felt that I was taking a
chance."
</p><p>So matters went on smoothly for a time. And Mr. Meadow Mouse spent hours
in the gallery under the cornfield. And he grew fatter every day.
Naturally he did not take such pains to dodge Grandfather Mole--after
the talk they had had. And when the two met one evening Grandfather Mole
stopped Mr. Meadow Mouse.
</p><p>"There's something I want to say to you," he remarked. "I notice you're
looking extremely well-fed. And I hope you're not eating any of my
angleworms."
</p><p>Mr. Meadow Mouse laughed right in Grandfather Mole's face.
</p><p>"Oh, no!" he replied.
</p><p>"Nor any of my grubs or bugs?" Grandfather Mole persisted.
</p><p>"Certainly not!" said Mr. Meadow Mouse, making a wry face as he
spoke--for he was rather a dainty person. And then he whispered
something to Grandfather Mole.
</p><p>"Oh!" said Grandfather Mole. "So that's it, eh? Well, I don't mind. I
never eat anything of that sort. Take all you want of it!"
