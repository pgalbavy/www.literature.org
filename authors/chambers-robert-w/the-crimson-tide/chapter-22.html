<p>She felt a trifle weak. In her ears there lingered a dull, confused
sensation, like the echo of things still falling. Something had
gone very wrong with the scheme of nature. Even beneath her feet,
now, the floor seemed unsteady, unreliable.</p>

<p>A half-darkness dimmed her eyes; she laid one slim hand on the
sofa-back and seated herself, fighting instinctively for consciousness.</p>

<p>She sat there for a long while. The swimming faintness passed
away. An intense stillness seemed to invade her, and the room,
and the street outside. And for vast distances beyond. Half hours
and hours rang clearly through the silence from the mantel-clock.
So still was the place that a sheaf of petals falling from a fading
rose on the piano seemed to fill the room with ghostly rustling.</p>

<p>This, then, was the finish. Love had ended. Youth itself was
ending, too, here in the dead silence of this lamplit room.</p>

<p>There remained nothing more. Except that ever darkening horizon
where, at the earth's ends, those grave shapes of cloud closed
out the vista of remote skies.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no shelter anywhere in the vast nakedness
of the scheme of things&mdash;no shadow under which to crouch&mdash;no refuge.</p>

<p>Dim visions of cloistered forms, moving in a blessed twilight,
grew and assumed familiar shape amid the dumb desolation reigning
in her brain. The spectral temptation passed, repassed; processional,
recessional glided by, timed by her heart's low rhythm.</p>

<p>But, little by little, she came to understand that there was
no refuge even there; no mystic glow in the dark corridors of
her own heart; no source of light save from the candles glimmering
on the high altar; no aureole above the crucifix.</p>

<p>Always, everywhere, there seemed to be no shelter, no roof above
the scheme of things.</p>

<p>She heard the telephone. As she slowly rose from the sofa she
noted the hour as it sounded;&mdash;four o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>A man's voice was speaking&mdash;an unhurried, precise, low-pitched,
monotonous voice:</p>

<p>"This&mdash;is&mdash;the&mdash;Memorial Hospital. Doctor&mdash;Willis&mdash;speaking.
Mr. &mdash;John-Estridge&mdash;died&mdash;at&mdash;ten minutes&mdash;to&mdash;four. Miss
Westgard&mdash;wishes&mdash;to-go&mdash;to&mdash;your&mdash;residence&mdash;and&mdash;remain&mdash;over&mdash;night&mdash;if&mdash;convenient....
Thank you. Miss &mdash;Westgard&mdash;will&mdash;go&mdash;to&mdash;you&mdash;immediately.
Good-night."</p>

<p>Palla rose from her chair in the unfurnished drawing-room, went
out into the hall, admitted Ilse, then locked and chained the
two front doors.</p>

<p>When she turned around, trembling and speechless, they kissed.
But it was only Palla's mouth that trembled; and when they mounted
the stairs it was Ilse's arm that supported Palla.</p>

<p>Except that her eyes were heavy and seemed smeared with deep
violet under the lower lids, Ilse did not appear very much changed.</p>

<p>She took off her furs, hat, and gloves and sat down beside Palla.
Her voice was quite clear and steady; there appeared to be no
sign of shock or of grief, save for a passing tremor of her tired
eyes now and then.</p>

<p>She said: "We talked a little together, Jack and I, after I telephoned
to you.</p>

<p>"That was the last. His hand began to burn in mine steadily,
like something on fire. And when, presently, I found he was not
asleep, I motioned to the night nurse.</p>

<p>"The change seemed to come suddenly; she went to find one of
the internes; I sat with my hand on his pulse.... There were three
physicians there.... Jack was not conscious after midnight."</p>

<p>Palla's lips and throat were dry and aching and her voice almost
inaudible:</p>

<p>"Darling," she whispered, "&mdash;darling&mdash;if I could give him back
to you and take his place!&#11834;"</p>

<p>Ilse smiled, but her heavy eyelids quivered:</p>

<p>"The scheme of things is so miserably patched together.... Except
for the indestructible divinity within each one of us, it all
would be so hopeless.... I had never been able to imagine Jack
and Death together&mdash;" She looked up at the clock. "He was alive
only an hour ago.... Isn't it strange&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ilse, Ilse! I wish this God who deals out such wickedness
and misery had struck me down instead!"</p>

<p>Neither seemed to notice the agnostic paradox in this bitter
cry wrung from a young girl's grief.</p>

<p>Ilse closed her eyes as though to rest them, and sat so, her
steady hand on Palla's. And, so resting, said in her unfaltering
voice:</p>

<p>"Jack, of course, lives.... But it seems a long time to wait
to see him."</p>

<p>"Jack lives," whispered Palla.</p>

<p>"Of course.... Only&mdash;it seems so long a time to wait.... I wanted
to show him&mdash;how kind love has been to us&mdash;how still more wonderful
love could have been to us ... for I could have borne him many
children.... And now I shall bear but one."</p>

<p>After a silence, Palla lifted her eyes. In them the shadow of
terror still lingered; there was not an atom of colour in her
face.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Ilse slept that night, though Palla scarcely closed her eyes.
Dreadful details of the coming day rose up to haunt her&mdash;all the
ghastly routine necessary before the dead lie finally undisturbed
by the stir and movement of many footsteps&mdash;the coming and going
of the living.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>Because what they called pneumonia was the Black Death of the
ancient East, they had warned Ilse to remain aloof from that inert
thing that had been her lover. So she did not look upon his face
again.</p>

<p>There were relatives of sorts at the chapel. None spoke to her.
The sunshine on the flower-covered casket was almost spring like.</p>

<p>And in the cemetery, too, there was no snow; and, under the dead
grass, everywhere new herbage tinted the earth with delicate green.</p>

<p>Ilse returned from the cemetery with Palla. Her black veil and
garments made of her gold hair and blond skin a vivid beauty that
grief had not subdued.</p>

<p>That deathless courage which was part of her seemed to sustain
the clear glow of her body's vigour as it upheld her dauntless
spirit.</p>

<p>"Did you see Jim in the chapel?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>Palla nodded. She had seen Marya, also. After a little while
Ilse said gravely:</p>

<p>"I think it no treachery to creed when one submits to the equally
vital belief of another. I think our creed includes submission,
because that also is part of love."</p>

<p>Palla lifted her face in flushed surprise:</p>

<p>"Is there any compromising with truth?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I think love is the greatest truth. What difference does it
make how we love?"</p>

<p>"Does not our example count? You had the courage of your belief.
Do you counsel me to subscribe to what I do not believe by acquiescing
in it?"</p>

<p>Ilse closed her sea-blue eyes as though fatigued. She said dreamily:</p>

<p>"I think that to believe in love and mating and the bearing of
children is the only important belief in the world. But under
what local laws you go about doing these things seems to be of
minor importance,&mdash;a matter, I should say, of personal inclination."</p>

<p>Ilse wished to go home. That is, to her own apartment, where
now were enshrined all her memories of this dead man who had given
to her womanhood that ultimate crown which in her eyes seemed
perfect.</p>

<p>She said serenely to Palla: "Mine is not the loneliness that
craves company with the living. I have a long time to wait; that
is all. And after a while I shall not wait alone.</p>

<p>"So you must not grieve for me, darling. You see I know that
Jack lives. It's just the long, long wait that calls for courage.
But I think it is a little easier to wait alone until&mdash;until there
are two to wait&mdash;for him&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Will you call me when you want me, Ilse?"</p>

<p>"Always, darling. Don't grieve. Few women know happiness. I have
known it. I know it now. It shall not even die with me."</p>

<p>She smiled faintly and turned to enter her doorway; and Palla
continued on alone toward that dwelling which she called home.</p>

<p>The mourning which she had worn for her aunt, and which she had
worn for John Estridge that morning, she now put off, although
vaguely inclined for it. But she shrank from the explanations
in which it was certain she must become involved when on duty
at the Red Cross and the canteen that afternoon.</p>

<p>Undressed, she sent her maid for a cup of tea, feeling too tired
for luncheon. Afterward she lay down on her bed, meaning merely
to close her eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>It was after four in the afternoon when she sat up with a start&mdash;too
late for the Red Cross; but she could do something at the canteen.</p>

<p>She went about dressing as though bruised. It seemed to take
an interminable time. Her maid called a taxi; but the short winter
daylight had nearly gone when she arrived at the canteen.</p>

<p>She remained there on kitchen duty until seven, then untied her
white tablier, washed, pinned on her hat, and went out into the
light-shot darkness of the streets and turned her steps once more
toward home.</p>

<p>There is, among the weirder newspapers of the metropolis, a sheet
affectionately known as "pink-and-punk," the circulation of which
seems to depend upon its distribution of fake "extras."</p>

<p>As Palla turned into her street, shabby men with hoarse voices
were calling an extra and selling the newspaper in question.</p>

<p>She bought one, glanced at the headlines, then, folding it, unlocked
her door.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced almost immediately, but she could not touch
it.</p>

<p>She sank down on the sofa, still wearing her furs and hat. After
a little while she opened her newspaper.</p>

<p>It seemed that a Bolsheviki plot had been discovered to murder
the premiers and rulers of the allied nations, and to begin simultaneously
in every capital and principal city of Europe and America a reign
of murder and destruction.</p>

<p>In fact, according to the account printed in startling type,
the Terrorists had already begun their destructive programme in
Philadelphia. Half a dozen buildings&mdash;private dwellings and one
small hotel&mdash;had been more or less damaged by bombs. A New York
man named Wilding, fairly well known as an impresario, had been
killed outright; and a Russian pianist, Vanya Tchernov, who had
just arrived in Philadelphia to complete arrangements for a concert
to be given by him under Mr. Wilding's management, had been fatally
injured by the collapse of the hotel office which, at that moment,
he was leaving in company with Mr. Wilding.</p>

<p>A numbness settled over Palla's brain. She did not seem to be
able to comprehend that this affair concerned Vanya&mdash;that this
newspaper was telling her that Vanya had been fatally hurt somewhere
in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Hours later, while she was lying on the lounge with her face
buried in the cushions, and still wearing her hat and furs, somebody
came into the room. And when she turned over she saw it was Ilse.</p>

<p>Palla sat up stupidly, the marks of tears still glistening under
her eyes. Ilse picked up the newspaper from the couch, laid it
aside, and seated herself.</p>

<p>"So you know about Vanya?" she said calmly.</p>

<p>Palla nodded.</p>

<p>"You don't know all. Marya called me on the telephone a few minutes
ago to tell me."</p>

<p>"Vanya is dead," whispered Palla.</p>

<p>"Yes. They found an unmailed letter directed to Marya in his
pockets. That's why they notified her."</p>

<p>After an interval: "So Vanya is dead," repeated Palla under her
breath.</p>

<p>Ilse sat plaiting the black edges of her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"It's such a&mdash;a senseless interruption&mdash;death&#11834;" she murmured.
"It seems so wanton, so meaningless in the scheme of things ...
to make two people wait so long&mdash;so long!&mdash;to resume where they
had been interrupted&#11834;"</p>

<p>Palla asked coldly whether Marya had seemed greatly shocked.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Palla. She called me up and told me. I asked her
if there was anything I could do; and she answered rather strangely
that what remained for her to do she would do alone. I don't know
what she meant."</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Whether Marya herself knew exactly what she meant seemed not
to be entirely clear to her. For, when Mr. Puma, dressed in a
travelling suit and carrying a satchel, arrived at her apartment
in the Hotel Rajah, and entered the reception room with his soundless,
springy step, she came out of her bedroom partly dressed, and
still hooking her waist.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" she demanded contemptuously, looking
him over from, head to foot. "Did you really suppose I meant to
go to Mexico with you?"</p>

<p>His heavy features crimsoned: "What pleasantry is this, my Marya?&#11834;"
he began; but the green blaze in her slanting eyes silenced him.</p>

<p>"The difference," she said, "between us is this. You run from
those who threaten you. I kill them."</p>

<p>"Of&mdash;of what nonsense are you speaking!" he stammered. "All is
arranged that we shall go at eleven&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No," she said wearily, "one sometimes plays with stray animals
for a few moments&mdash;and that is all. And that is all I ever saw
in you, Angelo&mdash;a stray beast to amuse and entertain me between
two yawns and a cup of tea." She shrugged, still twisted lithely
in her struggle to hook her waist. "You may go," she added, not
even looking at him, "or, if you are not too cowardly, you may
come with me to the Red Flag Club."</p>

<p>"In God's name what do you mean&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Mean? I mean to take my pistol to the Red Flag Club and kill
some Bolsheviki. That is what I mean, my Angelo&mdash;my ruddy Eurasian
pig!"</p>

<p>She slipped in the last hook, turned and enveloped him again
with an insolent, slanting glance: "<em>Allons!</em> Do you come
to the Red Flag?"</p>

<p>"Marya&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes or no! <em>Allez!</em>"</p>

<p>"My God, are&mdash;are you then demented?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"My God, I'm not," she mimicked him, "but I can't answer for
what I might do to you if you hang around this apartment any longer."</p>

<p>She came slowly toward him, her hands bracketed on her hips,
her strange eyes narrowing.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," she said. "I have loved many times. But never
<em>you</em>! One doesn't love your kind. One experiments, possibly,
if idle.</p>

<p>"A man died to-day whom I loved; but was too stupid to love enough.
Perhaps he knows now how stupid I am.... Unless they blew his
soul to pieces, also. <em>Allez!</em> Good-night. I tell you I
have business to attend to, and you stand there rolling your woman's
eyes at me!&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Damn you!" he said between his teeth. "What is the matter with
you&#11834;"</p>

<p>He had caught her arm; she wrenched it free, tearing the sleeve
to her naked shoulder.</p>

<p>Then she went to her desk and took a pistol from an upper drawer.</p>

<p>"If you don't go," she said, "I shall have to shoot you and leave
you here kicking on the carpet."</p>

<p>"In God's name, Marya!" he cried hoarsely, "who is it you shall
kill at the hall?"</p>

<p>"I shall kill Sondheim and Bromberg and Kastner, I hope. What
of it?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;if I go to-night&mdash;the others will say <em>I</em> did it!
I can't run away if you do such thing! I can not go into Mexico
but they shall arrest me before I am at the border&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Eurasian pig, I shall admit the killing!" she said with a green
gleam in her eyes that perhaps was laughter.</p>

<p>"Yes, my Marya," he explained in agony, the sweat pouring from
his temples, "but if they think me your accomplice they shall
arrest me. Me&mdash;I can not wait &mdash;I shall be ruined if I am
arrest! You do not comprehend. I have not said it to you how it
is that I am compel to travel with some money which&mdash;which is
not&mdash;my own."</p>

<p>Marya looked at him for a long while. Suddenly she flung the
pistol into a corner, threw back her head while peal on peal of
laughter rang out in the room.</p>

<p>"A thief," she said, fairly holding her slender sides between
gemmed fingers: " &mdash;Just a Levantine thief, after all! Not
a thing to shoot. Not a man. No! But a giant cockroach from the
tropics. Ugh! Too large to place one's foot upon!&#11834;"</p>

<p>She came leisurely forward, halted, inspected him with laughing
insolence:</p>

<p>"And the others &mdash;Kastner, Sondheim&mdash;and the other vermin?
You were quite right. Why should I kill them&mdash;merely because to-day
a real man died? What if they are the same species of vermin that
slew Vanya Tchernov? They are not men to pay for it. My pistol
could not make a dead man out of a live louse! No, you are quite
correct. You know your own kind. It would be no compliment to
Vanya if I should give these vermin the death that real men die!"</p>

<p>Puma stood close to the door, furtively passing a thick tongue
over his dry, blanched lips.</p>

<p>"Then you will not interfere?" he asked softly.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders: one was bare with the torn sleeve
dangling. "No," she said wearily. "Run home, painted pig. After
all, the world is mostly swine.... I, too, it seems&#11834;" She half
raised her arms, but the gesture failed, and she stood thinking
again and staring at the curtained window. She did not hear him
leave.</p>
