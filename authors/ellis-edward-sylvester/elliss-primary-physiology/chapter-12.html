<p>"Early to bed and early to rise" should be your motto. Children
need abundant sleep, and ought to retire early and rise as soon
as they awake in the morning. Their bodies and brains require
regular rest.</p>

<p>Never lie on your back when sleeping, but on the left or right
side. Place your limbs in the easiest position possible; otherwise
you will be troubled by bad dreams, which will awake you from
slumber. Try to keep your mouth closed, so as to breathe through
your nostrils. You will thus escape the unpleasant habit of snoring.</p>

<em>TIME FOR SLEEP</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Infants and old people need more sleep than boys and girls. Night
is made for rest, and the day for work. Do not take naps through
the day nor sit up late at night. Never lie down to sleep directly
after a meal.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>POSITION IN STANDING, ETC</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Children are apt to stand and sit in a wrong position. When walking,
the head and shoulders should be thrown back, so as to give the
lungs full play. Breathe slowly and deeply, filling every part
of the lungs at each inspiration. When in the school-room or at
home, be careful not to lean over by bending the body in the middle
of the back.</p>

</div>
<p>I am afraid that a good many children will find, if they notice
their posture when studying their lessons, that their spines are
curved like a bow and their shoulders pushed forward so as to
crowd the lungs and prevent deep, healthful breathing. The boys,
perhaps, will find a large dent or wrinkle in their clothing in
front at the pit of the stomach. This shows that their posture
is wrong.</p>

<em>WHERE TO BEND THE BODY</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>If you wish to bend forward, the pivot is at the hips; the spine
should not be bent at all. When a child is reminded that his posture
is wrong, he is apt to straighten up with a jerk, throw his shoulders
far back and thrust his chest forward like a pouter pigeon. This
is almost as bad as the other extreme, for it is unnatural, and
after a few minutes, they gradually return to their former stoop.
The natural posture is easy and graceful and can be held longer
than any other.</p>

<p>  What should be your motto? What do children need? What do their  
bodies and brains require?</p>

<p>  What position should be taken when lying in bed? What should
be done   with the limbs? What of bad dreams? How can you avoid
the habit of   snoring?</p>

<p>  Who needs the most sleep? What is said of night and day? What
of   taking naps through the day? When should you avoid sleep?</p>

<p>  What of standing and sitting? What ought your posture to be
when   walking? What is the right way to breathe? What must be
guarded   against when in the school-room or at home?</p>

<p>  What will a good many children find, if they notice their posture  
when studying their lessons? What will show a boy that his position  
is wrong?</p>

<p>  What is the right way to bend forward? What of the spine? What
is a   child apt to do when shown that his position at the desk
is wrong?   What have you to say of this? </p>
