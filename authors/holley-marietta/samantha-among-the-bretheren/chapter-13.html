<p>Curius, hain't it? How folks will get to tellin' things, and finally
tell 'em so much, that finally they will get to believin' of 'em
themselves - boastin' of bein' rich, etc., or bad. Now I have seen folks
boast over that, act real haughty because they had been bad and got over
it. I've seen temperance lecturers and religious exhorters boast sights
and sights over how bad they had been. But they wuzn't tellin' the
truth, though they had told the same thing so much that probable they
had got to thinkin' so.</p>

<p>But in the case of one man in petickuler, I found out for myself, for I
didn't believe what he wuz a sayin' any of the time.</p>

<p>Why, he made out in evenin' meetin's, protracted and otherwise, that he
had been a awful villain. Why no pirate wuz ever wickeder than he made
himself out to be, in the old times before he turned round and become
pious.</p>

<p>[Illustration: &quot;HIS FACE WUZ A GOOD MORAL FACE.&quot;]</p>

<p>But I didn't believe it, for he had a good look to his face, all but the
high headed look he had, and sort o' vain.</p>

<p>But except this one look, his face wuz a good moral face, and I knew
that no man could cut up and act as he claimed that he had, without
carryin' some marks on the face of the cuttin' up, and also of the
actin'.</p>

<p>And so, as it happened, I went a visitin' (to Josiah's relations) to the
very place where he had claimed to do his deeds of wild badness, and I
found that he had always been a pattern man - never had done a single
mean act, so fur as wuz known.</p>

<p>Where wuz his boastin' then? As the Bible sez, why, it wuz all vain
talk. He had done it to get up a reputation. He had done it because he
wuz big feelin' and vain. And he had got so haughty over it, and had
told of it so much, that I spoze he believed in it himself.</p>

<p>Curius! hain't it? But I am a eppisodin', and to resoom. Trueman's wife
would talk jest so, jest so haughty and high headed, about the world
comin' to a end.</p>

<p>She'd dispute with everybody right up and down if they disagreed with
her - and specially about that religion of hern. How sot she wuz, how
extremely sot.</p>

<p>But then, it hain't in me, nor never wuz, to fight anybody for any
petickuler religion of theirn. There is sights and sights of different
religions round amongst different friends of mine, and most all on 'em
quite good ones.</p>

<p>That is, they are agreeable to the ones who believe in 'em, and not over
and above disagreeable to me.</p>

<p>Now it seems to me that in most all of these different doctrines and
beliefs, there is a grain of truth, and if folks would only kinder hold
onto that grain, and hold themselves stiddy while they held onto it,
they would be better off.</p>

<p>But most folks when they go to follerin' off a doctrine, they foller too
fur, they hain't megum enough.</p>

<p>Now, for instance, when you go to work and whip anybody, or hang 'em, or
burn 'em up for not believin' as you do, that is goin' too fur.</p>

<p>It has been done though, time and agin, in the world's history, and
mebby will be agin.</p>

<p>But it hain't reasonable. Now what good will doctrines o' any kind do to
anybody after they are burnt up or choked to death?</p>

<p>You see such things hain't bein' megum. Because I can't believe jest as
somebody else duz, it hain't for me to pitch at 'em and burn 'em up, or
even whip 'em.</p>

<p>No, indeed! And most probable if I should study faithfully out their
beliefs, I would find one grain, or mebby a grain and a half of real
truth in it.</p>

<p>[Illustration: &quot;EF I FELL ON A STUN.&quot;]</p>

<p>Now, for instance, take the doctrines of Christian Healin', or Mind
Cure. Now I can't exactly believe that if I fell down and hurt my head
on a stun - I cannot believe as I am a layin' there, that I hain't fell,
and there hain't no stun - and while I am a groanin' and a bathin' the
achin' bruise in anarky and wormwood, I can't believe that there hain't
no such thing as pain, nor never wuz.</p>

<p>No, I can't believe this with the present light I have got on the
subject.</p>

<p>But yet, I have seen them that this mind cure religion had fairly riz
right up, and made 'em nigher to heaven every way - so nigh to it that
seemin'ly a light out of some of its winders had lit up their faces with
its glowin' repose, its sweet rapture.</p>

<p>I've seen 'em, seen 'em as the Patent Medicine Maker observes so
frequently, &quot;before and after takin'.&quot;</p>

<p>Folks that wuz despondent and hopeless, and wretched actin', why, this
belief made 'em jest blossom right out into a state of hopefulness, and
calmness, and joy - refreshin' indeed to contemplate.</p>

<p>Wall now, the idee of whippin' anybody for believin' anything that
brings such a good change to 'em, and fills them and them round 'em with
so much peace and happiness.</p>

<p>Why, I wouldn't do it for a dollar bill. And as for hangin' 'em, and
brilin' 'em on gridirons, etc., why, that is entirely out of the
question, or ort to be.</p>

<p>And now, it don't seem to me that I ever could make a tree walk off, by
lookin' at it, and commandin' it to - or call some posys to fall down
into my lap, right through, the plasterin' - </p>

<p>Or send myself, or one of myselfs, off to Injy, while the other one of
me stayed to Jonesville.</p>

<p>Now, honestly speakin', it don't seem to me that I ever could learn to
do this, not at my age, any way, and most dead with rheumatiz a good
deal of the time.</p>

<p>I most know I couldn't.</p>

<p>But then agin I have seen believers in Theosiphy that could do wonders,
and seemed indeed to have got marvelous control over the forces of
Natur.</p>

<p>And now the idee of my whippin' 'em for it. Why you wouldn't ketch me at
it.</p>

<p>And Spiritualism now! I spoze, and I about know that there are lots
of folks that won't ever see into any other world than this, till the
breath leaves their body.</p>

<p>Yet i've seen them, pure sweet souls too, as I ever see, whose eyes
beheld blessed visions withheld from more material gaze.</p>

<p>Yes, i've neighbored with about all sorts of religius believers, and
never disputed that they had a right to their own religion.</p>

<p>And I've seen them too that didn't make a practice of goin' to any
meetin' houses much, who lived so near to God and his angels that they
felt the touch of angel hands on their forwards every day of their
lives, and you could see the glow of the Fairer Land in their rapt eyes.</p>

<p>They had outgrown the outward forms of religion that had helped them
at first, jest as children outgrow the primers and ABC books of their
childhood and advance into the higher learnin'.</p>

<p>I've seen them folks i've neighbored with 'em. Human faults they had,
or God would have taken them to His own land before now. Their
imperfections, I spoze sort o' anchored 'em here for a spell to a
imperfect world.</p>

<p>But you could see, if you got nigh enough to their souls to see anything
about 'em - you could see that the anchor chains wuz slight after all,
and when they wuz broke, oh how lightly and easily they would sail away,
away to the land that their rapt souls inhabited even now.</p>

<p>Yes, I've seen all sorts of religius believers and I wuzn't goin' to be
too hard on Tamer for her belief, though I couldn't believe as she did.</p>
