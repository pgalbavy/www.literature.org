<p><em>LET ME </em>skip a great deal of what may be called introduction,
for of necessity it bore a resemblance to that which has already
been told, and has little if any connection with the main events
of my story.</p>

<p>Mr. Watrous’ arrangements for the comfort of the boys was perfect.
The ride to St. Louis in the famous Limited Express was the luxury
of railway travelling, and they landed in the Mound City within
twenty-four hours after leaving Philadelphia, where Nick met his
old friend, Ned Osmun, who had given to him his wonderful ride
on his engine to Jersey City. He wished them every pleasure on
their long journey, which he said caused him a touch of envy,
but he meant to even-up matters by another fishing excursion in
Western Pennsylvania, with a call on Nick’s parents and pretty
Nellie.</p>

<p>They stayed overnight at the Lindell in St. Louis, but were in
such a hurry to reach their destination that, without spending
any time in visiting the sights and interesting scenes, they left
the following morning over the Iron Mountain Railway for Texarkana.</p>

<p>This ride, though long and at times tedious, was enjoyed by both,
for the scenes and incidents gave a foretaste of what was coming.
A number of cattlemen were on the train, and the boys struck up
an acquaintance with them. They found them pleasant and ready
to impart all the information that was asked for.</p>

<p>There were long hours of riding through the dismal pine woods
of Missouri and Arkansas, where, mile after mile, they saw only
an occasional settler’s cabin, with the half-dressed children
playing around the door. In several cases, the openings between
the logs were so large that they could look through both the front
and rear of the structure and see the trees on the other side.</p>

<p>They left the train at Malvern, and took the narrow gauge railway
to the celebrated Hot Springs, twenty-five miles distant, where
they stayed overnight. One of the interesting facts learned here
was the clever manner in which "Diamond Jo," who built and owns
the narrow gauge railway, outwitted the Arkansas Legislature,
which forbade a charge of more than five cents a mile on every
line in the State between any two places. The capitalist named
had been charging and receiving ten cents a mile, and he now flanked
the law by locating the western terminus of his line within two
or three feet of the boundary of Hot Springs, and continued serenely
to receive his excessive rates as before.</p>

<p>They reached Texarkana Saturday evening, and, since there was
no travelling westward on Sunday, that day was spent in the town,
which lies partly within Texas and partly within Arkansas, and
includes within its odd name a portion of the appellation of each
of the two States.</p>

<p>They attended church, which was capable of accommodating fifty
people by crowding, and whose walls contained but a single placard,
which was a request for the attendants not to spit on the floor.</p>

<p>The next stopping place was at Austin, the capital of Texas.
The weather was quite warm, but the nights were cool and breezy,
and the glimpses of the snowy cotton fields were a treat to the
boys, who looked upon them for the first time.</p>

<p>They spent one night and a portion of a day in Austin, visiting
the capitol and strolling through the city, which contains many
fine buildings of white marble-like stone, peculiar to the vicinity.
In the capitol they saw several fine paintings of the early heroes
of Texas. On the cenotaph (since destroyed by the burning of the
capitol), was the inscription to the memory of the defenders of
the Alamo, which is one of the most striking tributes ever conceived
by man: "<em>THERMOPYLÆ HAD ITS MESSENGER OF DEFEAT: THE ALAMO
HAD NONE</em>."</p>

<p>The railway line to San Antonio had recently been finished, and
they arrived in that quaint old town as night was closing in.
A bright moon was shining in an unclouded sky, and, after registering
at the Menger House, facing the Plaza, they strolled through the
city and enjoyed a view of the Alamo by moonlight. The brown adobe
walls were softened in the mild radiance, and, as Nick described
the defence made by the garrison of less than two hundred men
against four thousand Mexicans under Santa Anna, it seemed to
Herbert that he was witnessing that tremendous fight, which continued
for eleven days, until only a dozen grimy, panting, and exhausted
defenders were left. The terrible Colonel Bowie was shot in his
sick bed, and Davy Crockett was among the handful that at last
surrendered, under the promise of honorable treatment, but were
treacherously massacred by Santa Anna.</p>

<p>The winding Colorado was impressively beautiful in the moonlight,
and the adobe mission houses, which were visited the next day,
were viewed with the interest that all tourists feel when they
first look upon them. Each was over a century old. One, in a fine
state of preservation, was pointed out, where the Jesuit fathers
were besieged by the Comanche Indians for nearly two years.</p>

<p>Among the curiosities noticed in San Antonio were the Mexican
dogs, without a hair on their bodies, and the other canines, known
as "tramps" or "nobody’s dogs," who roam over the country between
the city and the Rio Grande, picking up their food, as do their
biped brothers, and confessing to the ownership of no one. That
portion of San Antonio called Mexico was squalid, and made up
of old residents, many of whom cannot speak a word of English,
while in other sections nearly everyone understands English, Spanish,
and German.</p>

<p>The boys stayed several days in this city, for they looked upon
it as their real starting point or entrance into the great southwest.
They had talked over the question while on their way thither,
and agreed upon the line to be followed. Herbert had a letter
of recommendation to Mr. Lord, a banker, by which he could secure
all the funds needed, and who showed a wish to help him in every
way in his power.</p>

<p>He invited the boys to visit him at his house, where they spent
an evening with the gentleman, who, having been a resident in
Texas from a date several years before the Civil War, was able
to give the very knowledge and counsel they needed. He told them
a fact that they had not noticed. San Antonio itself is a resort
for invalids threatened with, or suffering from, pulmonary weakness,
who find the mild, equable climate very helpful. He had known
of cases in which it had wrought a complete cure.</p>

<p>"But I see," he said with a smile, "that that doesn’t suit your
ideas; while there are many sights here that you have not seen—such
as the Colorado Springs—yet you could not content yourselves in
our sleepy town for more than a day or two longer. You can take
the stage from here to El Paso, but the ride is tiresome, and,
at this season of the year, dusty and trying to a degree."</p>

<p>"I don’t think we should fancy that," said Nick, who refrained
from giving a hint of the plan they had formed.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are both good horsemen?" was the inquiring remark
of the banker.</p>

<p>They answered that they were fairly good riders. Nick had learned
to ride horses almost as soon as he could walk, and Herbert had
taken instructions at an academy in New York for a couple of years
past.</p>

<p>"Everybody rides a horse or burro in Texas," said Mr. Lord, "and
the only caution you need is to make sure you possess a clear
title to the animal you throw your leg over. There are few people
hanged in Texas for murder, but plenty are strung up every year
for horse-stealing. You would be objects of suspicion if you should
take a walk out in the country. My advice, then, is to buy three
excellent ponies, provide yourselves with a good outfit, including
a fine repeating Winchester rifle and a revolver apiece, with
plenty of ammunition. You will need an extra animal to carry your
luggage. Then strike out for New Mexico. You will have to ride
a clean five hundred miles before crossing the boundary, but it
is the right season of the year, and the ride will do you good."</p>

<p>"Do you advise us to go alone?" asked Herbert.</p>

<p>"By no means; you must have companions who are familiar with
the country, and they can be easily secured."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"There are hunters, miners, prospectors, and adventurers in San
Antonio all the time, who have either just come from the wild
regions beyond or are about to set out for them. They may be rough
in their ways, but they are generally honest and trustworthy,
and there will be no trouble in engaging them as companions."</p>

<p>"You have laid out the plan Herbert and I had fixed upon, but
we felt doubts about being able to carry it out. We have informed
ourselves, so far as we can, concerning the country over which
we wish to ride, and the more we learned, the more we saw the
need of having men who were familiar with it. How about the Indians?"</p>

<p>"Well, you are liable to meet them, but I do not think there
is much to be feared, as I have heard no disquieting rumors lately,
though," added the banker significantly, "I was shot at myself,
within the present year, by a party of marauding Comanches, within
six miles of San Antonio. When you get into New Mexico, you will
be likely to find matters more lively."</p>

<p>"Can you help us in engaging the right parties?"</p>

<p>"I think so; call around at my office to-morrow afternoon, when
I am quite sure I will be able to put you on the track of the
ones whom you ought to meet."</p>

<p>The lads assured their host that they would be glad to do so,
and, declining his kind invitation to spend the night at his home,
bade him good-evening and started on their return to the Menger
House.</p>
