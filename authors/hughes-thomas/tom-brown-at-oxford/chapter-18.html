<p>Dame Winburn was not long after her son, and they sat down together
to breakfast in their best Sunday clothes&mdash;she, in a plain large
white cap which covered all but a line of grey hair, a black stuff
gown reaching to neck and wrists, and small silk neckkerchief
put on like a shawl; a thin, almost gaunt old woman, whom the
years had not used tenderly, and who showed marks of their usage&mdash;but
a resolute, high-couraged soul, who had met hard times in the
face, and could meet them again if need were. She spoke in broad
Berkshire, and was otherwise a homely body, but self-possessed
and without a shade of real vulgarity in her composition.</p>

<p>The widow looked with some anxiety at Harry as he took his seat.
Although something of a rustic dandy, of late he had not been
so careful in the matter of dress as usual; but, in consequence
of her reproaches, on this Sunday there was nothing to complain
of. His black velveteen shooting coat, and cotton plush waistcoat,
his brown corduroy knee-breeches and gaiters, sat on him well,
and gave the world assurance of a well-to-do man, for few of the
Englebourn labourers rose above smock-frocks and fustian trousers.
He wore a blue bird's-eye handkerchief round his neck, and his
shirt, though coarse in texture, was as white as the sun and the
best laundress in Englebourn could manage to bleach it. There
was nothing to find fault with in his dress, therefore, but still
his mother did not feel quite comfortable as she took stealthy
glances at him. Harry was naturally a reserved fellow, and did
not make much conversation himself, and his mother felt a little
embarrassed on this particular morning.</p>

<p>It was not, therefore, until Dame Winburn had finished her first
slice of bread and butter, and had sipped the greater part of
her second dish of tea out of her saucer, that she broke silence.</p>

<p>"I minded thy business last night, Harry, when I wur up at the
Rectory about the washin'. It's my belief as thou'lt get t'other
'lotment next quarter-day. The Doctor spoke very kind about it,
and said as how he heer'd as high a character o' thee, young as
thee bist, as of are' a man in the parish, and as how he wur set
on lettin' the lots to thaay as'd do best by 'em; only he said
as the farmers went agin givin' more nor an acre to any man as
worked for <em>them</em>; and the Doctor, you see, he don't like
to go altogether agin the vestry folk."</p>

<p>"What business is it o' theirs," said Harry, "so long as they
get their own work done? There's scarce one on 'em as hasn't more
land already nor he can keep as should be, and for all that they
want to snap up every bit as falls vacant, so as no poor man shall
get it."</p>

<p>"'Tis mostly so with them as has," said his mother, with a half
puzzled look; "Scriptur says as to them shall be given, and they
shall have more abundant," Dame Winburn spoke hesitatingly, and
looked doubtfully at Harry, as a person who has shot with a strange
gun, and knows not what effect the bolt may have. Harry was brought
up all standing by this unexpected quotation of his mother's;
but, after thinking for a few moments while he cut himself a slice
of bread, replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It don't say as those shall have more that can't use what they've
got already. 'Tis a deal more like Naboth's vineyard for aught
as I can see. But 'tis little odds to me which way it goes."</p>

<p>"How canst talk so, Harry?" said his mother reproachfully; "thou
know'st thou wast set on it last fall, like a wasp on sugar. Why
scarce a day past but thou wast up to the Rectory, to see the
Doctor about it; and now thou'rt like to get th'lotment thou'lt
not go anyst 'un."</p>

<p>Harry looked out at the open door, without answering. It was
quite true that, in the last autumn, he had been very anxious
to get as large an allotment as he could into his own hands, and
that he had been for ever up towards the Rectory, but perhaps
not always on the allotment business. He was naturally a self-reliant,
shrewd fellow, and felt that if he could put his hand on three
or four acres of land, he could soon make himself independent
of the farmers. He knew that at harvest-times, and whenever there
was a pinch for good labourers, they would be glad enough to have
him; while at other times, with a few acres of his own, he would
be his own master and could do much better for himself. So he
had put his name down first on the Doctor's list, taken the largest
lot he could get, and worked it so well that his crops, amongst
others, had been a sort of village show last harvest-time. Many
of the neighboring allotments stood out in sad contrast to those
of Harry and the more energetic of the peasantry, and lay by the
side of these latter only half worked and full of weeds, and the
rent was never ready. It was worse than useless to let matters
go on thus, and the question arose, what was to be done with the
neglected lots. Harry, and all the men like him, applied at once
for them; and their eagerness to get them had roused some natural
jealousy amongst the farmers, who began to foresee that the new
system might shortly leave them with none but the worst labourers.
So the vestry had pressed on the Doctor, as Dame Winburn said,
not to let any man have more than an acre, or an acre and a half;
and the well-meaning, easy-going invalid old man couldn't make
up his mind what to do. So here was May again, and the neglected
lots were still in the nominal occupation of the idlers. The Doctor
got no rent, and was annoyed at the partial failure of a scheme
which he had not indeed originated, but for which he had taken
much credit to himself. The negligent occupiers grumbled that
they were not allowed a drawback for manure, and that no pigstyes
were put up for them. "'Twas allers understood so," they maintained,
"and they'd never ha' took to the lots but for that." The good
men grumbled that it would be too late now for them to do more
than clean the lots of weeds this year. The farmers grumbled that
it was always understood that no man should have more than one
lot. The poor rector had led his flock into a miry place with
a vengeance. People who cannot make up their minds breed trouble
in other places besides country villages. However quiet and out
of the way the place may be, there is always some <em>quasi</em>
public topic, which stands, to the rural Englishman, in the place
of treaty, or budget, or reform-bill. So the great allotment question,
for the time, was that which exercised the minds of the inhabitants
of Englebourn; and until lately no one had taken a keener interest
in it than Harry Winburn. But that interest had now much abated,
and so Harry looked through the cottage door, instead of answering
his mother.</p>

<p>"'Tis my belief as you med amost hev it for the axin'." Dame
Winburn began again when she found that he would not re-open the
subject himself. "The young missus said as much to me herself
last night. Ah! to be sure, things'd go better if she had the
guidin' on 'em."</p>

<p>"I'm not going after it any more, mother. We can keep the bits
o' sticks here together without it while you be alive; and if
anything was to happen to you, I don't think I should stay in
these parts. But it don't matter what becomes o' me; I can earn
a livelihood anywhere."</p>

<p>Dame Winburn paused a moment before answering to subdue her vexation,
and then said, "How can 'ee let hankerin' arter a lass take the
heart out o' thee so? Hold up thy head, and act a bit measterful.
The more thow makest o' thyself, the more like thou art to win."</p>

<p>"Did you hear aught of her last night, mother?" replied Harry,
taking advantage of this ungracious opening to speak of the subject
which was uppermost in his mind.</p>

<p>"I heer'd she wur goin' on well," said his mother.</p>

<p>"No likelihood of her comin' home?"</p>

<p>"Not as I could make out. Why, she hevn't been gone not four
months. Now, do 'ee pluck up a bit, Harry; and be more like thyself."</p>

<p>"Why, mother, I've not missed a day's work since Christmas; so
there ain't much to find fault with."</p>

<p>"Nay, Harry, 'tisn't thy work. Thou wert always good at thy work,
praise God. Thou'rt thy father's own son for that. But thou dostn't
keep about like, and take thy place wi' the lave on 'em since
Christmas. Thou look'st hagged at times, and folk'll see't, and
talk about thee afore long."</p>

<p>"Let 'em talk. I mind their talk no more than last year's wind,"
said Harry, abruptly.</p>

<p>"But thy old mother does," she said, looking at him with eyes
full of pride and love; and so Harry, who was a right good son,
began to inquire what it was that was specially weighing on his
mother's mind, determined to do anything in reason to re-place
her on the little harmless social pinnacle from which she was
wont to look down on all the other mothers and sons of the parish.
He soon found out that her present grievance arose from his having
neglected his place as ringer of the heavy bell in the village
peal on the two preceding Sundays; and, as this post was, in some
sort the corresponding one to stroke of the boat at Oxford, her
anxiety was reasonable enough. So Harry promised to go to ringing
in good time that morning, and then set about little odds and
ends of jobs till it would be time to start. Dame Winburn went
to her cooking and other household duties, which were pretty well
got under when her son took his hat and started for the belfry.
She stood at the door with a half-peeled potato in one hand, shading
her eyes with the other, as she watched him striding along the
raised footpath under the elms, when the sound of light footsteps
and pleasant voices, coming up from the other direction, made
her turn round and drop a curtsey as the rector's daughter and
another young lady stopped at her door.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Betty," said the former; "here's a bright Sunday
morning at last, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"'Tis indeed, miss; but where hev'ee been to?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we've only been for a little walk before school-time. This
is my cousin, Betty. She hasn't been at Englebourn since she was
quite a child; so I've been taking her to the Hawk's Lynch to
see our view."</p>

<p>"And you can't think how I have enjoyed it," said her cousin;
"it is so still and beautiful."</p>

<p>"I've heer'd say as there ain't no such a place for thretty mile
round," said Betty, proudly, "But do'ee come in, tho', and sit'ee
down a bit," she added, bustling inside her door, and beginning
to rub down a chair with her apron; "'tis a smart step for gentlefolk
to walk afore church." Betty's notions of the walking powers of
gentlefolk were very limited.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, we must be getting on," said Miss Winter; "but
how lovely your flowers are! Look, Mary, did you ever see such
double pansies? We've nothing like them at the Rectory."</p>

<p>"Do'ee take some," said Betty, emerging again, and beginning
to pluck a handful of her finest flowers; "'tis all our Harry's
doing; he's 'mazing partickler about seeds."</p>

<p>"He seems to make everything thrive, Betty. There, that's plenty,
thank you. We won't take many, for fear they should fade before
church is over."</p>

<p>"Oh, dwont'ee be afeard, there's plenty more; and you be as welcom'
as the day."</p>

<p>Betty never said a truer word; she was one of the real open-handed
sort, who are found mostly amongst those who have the least to
give. They or anyone else were welcome to the best she had.</p>

<p>So the young ladies took the flowers, thanked her again, and
passed on towards the Sunday-school.</p>

<p>The rector's daughter might have been a year or so older than
her companion; she looked more. Her position in the village had
been one of much anxiety, and she was fast getting an old head
on young shoulders. The other young lady was a slip of a girl
just coming out; in fact, this was the first visit which she had
ever paid out of leading strings. She had lived in a happy home,
where she had always been trusted and loved, and perhaps a thought
too much petted.</p>

<p>There are some natures which attract petting; you can't help
doing your best to spoil them in this way, and it is satisfactory,
therefore, to know (as the fact is) that they are just the ones
which cannot be so spoilt.</p>

<p>Miss Mary was one of these. Trustful, for she had never been
tricked; fearless, for she had never been cowed; pure and bright
as the Englebourn brook at fifty yards from its parent spring
in the chalk, for she had a pure and bright nature, and had come
in contact as yet with nothing which could soil or cast a shadow.
What wonder that her life gave forth light and music as it glided
on, and that every one who knew her was eager to have her with
them, to warm themselves in the light and rejoice in the music!</p>

<p>Besides all her other attractions, or in consequence of them
for anything I know, she was one of the merriest young women in
the world, always ready to bubble over and break out into clear
laughter on the slightest provocation. And provocation had not
been wanting during the last two days which she had spent with
her cousin. As usual she had brought sunshine with her, and the
old doctor had half forgotten his numerous complaints and grievances
for the time. So the cloud which generally hung over the house
had been partially lifted, and Mary, knowing and suspecting nothing
of the dark side of life at Englebourn Rectory, rallied her cousin
on her gravity, and laughed till she cried at the queer ways and
talk of the people about the place.</p>

<p>As soon as they were out of hearing of Dame Winburn, Mary began&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Katie, I can't say that you have mended your case at all."</p>

<p>"Surely you can't deny that there is a great deal of character
in Betty's face?" said Miss Winter.</p>

<p>"Oh, plenty of character; all your people, as soon as they begin
to stiffen a little and get wrinkles, seem to be full of character,
and I enjoy it much more than beauty; but we were talking about
beauty, you know."</p>

<p>"Betty's son is the handsomest young man in the parish," said
Miss Winter; "and I must say I don't think you could find a better-looking
one anywhere."</p>

<p>"Then I can't have seen him."</p>

<p>"Indeed you have; I pointed him out to you at the post office
yesterday. Don't you remember? He was waiting for a letter."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! now I remember. Well, he was better than most. But
the faces of your young people in general are not interesting
&mdash;I don't mean the children, but the young men and women&mdash;and
they are awkward and clownish in their manners, without the quaintness
of the elder generation, who are the funniest old dears in the
world."</p>

<p>"They will all be quaint enough as they get older. You must remember
the sort of life they lead. They get their notions very slowly,
and they must have notions in their heads before they can show
them on their faces."</p>

<p>"Well, your Betty's son looked as if he had a notion of hanging
himself yesterday."</p>

<p>"It's no laughing matter, Mary. I hear that he is desperately
in love."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! that makes a difference, of course. I hope he won't
carry out his notion. Who is it, do you know? Do tell me all about
it."</p>

<p>"Our gardener's daughter, I believe. Of course, I never meddle
with these matters; but one can't help hearing the servant's gossip.
I think it likely to be true, for he was about our premises at
all sorts of times until lately, and I never see him now that
she is away."</p>

<p>"Is she pretty?" said Mary, who was getting interested.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is our belle. In fact, they are the two beauties of
the parish."</p>

<p>"Fancy that cross-grained old Simon having a pretty daughter.
Oh, Katie, look here! who is this figure of fun?"</p>

<p>The figure of fun was a middle-aged man of small stature, and
very bandy-legged, dressed in a blue coat and brass buttons, and
carrying a great bass-viol bigger than himself, in a rough baize
cover. He came out of a footpath into the road just before them,
and, on seeing them, touched his hat to Miss Winter, and then
fidgeted along with his load, and jerked his head in a deprecatory
manner away from them as he walked on, with the sort of look and
action which a favorite terrier uses when his master holds out
a lighted cigar to his nose. He was the village tailor and constable,
also the principal performer in the church-music which obtained
in Englebourn. In the latter capacity he had of late come into
collision with Miss Winter.</p>

<p>For this was another of the questions which divided the parish
&mdash;The great church music question. From time immemorial,
at least ever since the gallery at the west end had been built,
the village psalmody had been in the hands of the occupiers of
that Protestant structure. In the middle of the front row sat
the musicians, three in number, who played respectively a bass-viol,
a fiddle, and a clarionet. On one side of them were two or three
young women, who sang treble&mdash;shrill, ear-piercing treble&mdash;with
a strong nasal Berkshire drawl in it. On the other side of the
musicians sat the blacksmith, the wheelwright, and other tradesmen
of the place. Tradesmen means in that part of the country what
we mean by artisan, and these were naturally allied with the laborers,
and consorted with them. So far as church-going was concerned,
they formed a sort of independent opposition, sitting in the gallery,
instead of in the nave, where the farmers and the two or three
principal shopkeepers&mdash;the great landed and commercial interests&mdash;regularly
sat and slept, and where the two publicans occupied pews, but
seldom made even the pretence of worshipping.</p>

<p>The rest of the gallery was filled by the able-bodied male peasantry.
The old worn-out men generally sat below in the free seats; the
women also, and some few boys. But the hearts of these latter
were in the gallery&mdash;a seat on the back benches of which was a
sign that they had indued the <em>toga virilis</em>, and were
thenceforth free from maternal and pastoral tutelage in the matter
of church-going. The gallery thus constituted had gradually usurped
the psalmody as their particular and special portion of the service;
they left the clerk and the school children, aided by such of
the aristocracy below as cared to join, to do the responses; but,
when singing time came, they reigned supreme. The slate on which
the Psalms were announced was hung out from before the centre
of the gallery, and the clerk, leaving his place under the reading-desk,
marched up there to give them out. He took this method of preserving
his constitutional connection with the singing, knowing that otherwise
he could not have maintained the rightful position of his office
in this matter. So matters had stood until shortly before the
time of our story.</p>

<p>The present curate, however, backed by Miss Winter, had tried
a reform. He was a quiet man, with a wife and several children,
and small means. He had served in the diocese ever since he had
been ordained, in a hum-drum sort of way, going where he was sent
for, and performing his routine duties reasonably well, but without
showing any great aptitude for his work. He had little interest,
and had almost given up expecting promotion, which he certainly
had done nothing particular to merit. But there was one point
on which he was always ready to go out of his way, and take a
little trouble. He was a good musician, and had formed choirs
at all his former curacies.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival, therefore, he, in concert with Miss Winter,
had begun to train the children in church-music. A small organ,
which had stood in a passage in the Rectory for many years, had
been repaired, and appeared first at the schoolroom, and at length
under the gallery of the church; and it was announced one week
to the party in possession, that, on the next Sunday, the constituted
authorities would take the church-music into their own hands.
Then arose a strife, the end of which had nearly been to send
the gallery off, in a body, headed by the offended bass-viol,
to the small red-brick little Bethel at the other end of the village.
Fortunately the curate had too much good sense to drive matters
to extremities, and so alienate the parish constable, and a large
part of his flock, though he had not tact or energy enough to
bring them round to his own views. So a compromise was come to;
and the curate's choir were allowed to chant the Psalms and Canticles,
which had always been read before, while the gallery remained
triumphant masters of the regular Psalms.</p>

<p>My readers will now understand why Miss Winter's salutation to
the musical constable was not so cordial as it was to the other
villagers whom they had come across previously.</p>

<p>Indeed, Miss Winter, though she acknowledged the constable's
salutation, did not seem inclined to encourage him to accompany
them, and talk his mind out, although he was going the same way
with them; and, instead of drawing him out, as was her wont in
such cases, went on talking herself to her cousin.</p>

<p>The little man walked out in the road, evidently in trouble of
mind. He did not like to drop behind or go ahead without some
further remark from Miss Winter, and yet could not screw up his
courage to the point of opening the conversation himself. So he
ambled on alongside the footpath on which they were walking, showing
his discomfort by a twist of his neck every few seconds, and perpetual
shiftings of his bass-viol, and hunching up of one shoulder.</p>

<p>The conversation of the young ladies under these circumstances
was of course forced; and Miss Mary, though infinitely delighted
at the meeting, soon began to pity their involuntary companion.
She was full of the sensitive instinct which the best sort of
women have to such a marvellous extent, and which tells them at
once and infallibly if any one in their company has even a creased
rose-leaf next their moral skin.</p>

<p>Before they had walked a hundred yards she was interceding for
the rebellious constable.</p>

<p>"Katie," she said softly in French, "do speak to him. The poor
man is frightfully uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"It serves him right," answered Miss Winter in the same language;
"you don't know how impertinent he was the other day to Mr. Walker.
And he won't give way on the least point, and leads the rest of
the old singers, and makes them as stubborn as himself."</p>

<p>"But look how he is winking and jerking his head at you. You
really mustn't be so cruel to him, Katie. I shall have to begin
talking to him if you don't."</p>

<p>Thus urged, Miss Winter opened the conversation by asking after
his wife, and when she had ascertained "that his missus wur pretty
middlin," made some other commonplace remark, and relapsed into
silence. By the help of Mary, however, a sort of disjointed dialogue
was kept up till they came to the gate which led up to the school,
into which the children were trooping by twos and threes. Here
the ladies turned in, and were going up the walk towards the school
door, when the constable summoned up courage to speak on the matter
which was troubling him, and, resting the bass-viol carefully
on his right foot, calling out after them,</p>

<p>"Oh, please marm! Miss Winter!"</p>

<p>"Well," she said quietly, turning round, "what do you wish to
say?"</p>

<p>"Why, please mann, I hopes as you don't think I be any ways unked
'bout this here quire singin', as they calls it &mdash;I'm sartin
you knows as there ain't amost nothing I wouldn't do to please
ee."</p>

<p>"Well, you know how to do it very easily," she said when he paused.
"I don't ask you even to give up your music and try to work with
us, though I think you might have done that. I only ask you to
use some psalms and tunes which are fit to be used in a church."</p>

<p>"To be sure us ool. 'Taint we as wants no new-fangled tunes;
them as we sings be aal owld ones as ha' been used in our church
ever since I can mind. But you only choose thaay as you likes
out o' the book? and we be ready to kep to thaay."</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Walker made a selection for you some weeks ago,"
said Miss Winter; "did he not?"</p>

<p>"'Ees, but 'tis narra mossel o' use for we to try his 'goriums
and sich like. I hopes you wun't be offended wi' me, miss, for
I be telling nought but truth." He spoke louder as they got nearer
to the school door, and, as they were opening it, shouted his
last shot after them, "'Tis na good to try thaay tunes o' his'n,
miss. When us praises God, us likes to praise un joyful."</p>

<p>"There, you hear that, Mary," said Miss Winter. "You'll soon
begin to see why I look grave. There never was such a hard parish
to manage. Nobody will do what they ought. I never can get them
to do anything. Perhaps we may manage to teach the children better,
that's my only comfort."</p>

<p>"But, Katie dear, what <em>do</em> the poor things sing? Psalms,
I hope."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, but they choose all the odd ones on purpose, I believe.
Which class will you take?"</p>

<p>And so the young ladies settled to their teaching, and the children
in her class all fell in love with Mary before church-time.</p>

<p>The bass-viol proceeded to the church and did the usual rehearsals,
and gossiped with the sexton, to whom he confided the fact that
the young missus was "terrible vexed." The bells soon began to
ring, and Widow Winburn's heart was glad as she listened to the
full peal, and thought to herself that it was her Harry who was
making so much noise in the world, and speaking to all the neighborhood.
Then the peal ceased as church-time drew near, and the single
bell began, and the congregation came flocking in from all sides.
The farmers, letting their wives and children enter, gathered
round the church porch and compared notes in a ponderous manner
on crops and markets. The labourers collected near the door by
which the gallery was reached. All the men of the parish seemed
to like standing about before church, until they had seen the
clergyman safely inside. He came up with the school children and
the young ladies, and in due course the bell stopped and the service
began. There was a very good congregation still at Englebourn;
the adult generation had been bred up in times when every decent
person in the parish went to church, and the custom was still
strong, notwithstanding the rector's bad example. He scarcely
ever came to church himself in the mornings, though his wheelchair
might be seen going up and down on the gravel before his house
or on the lawn on warm days, and this was one of his daughter's
greatest troubles.</p>

<p>The little choir of children sang admirably, led by the schoolmistress,
and Miss Winter and the curate exchanged approving glances. They
performed the liveliest chant in their collection, that the opposition
might have no cause to complain of their want of joyfulness. And
in turn Miss Winter was in hopes that, out of deference to her,
the usual rule of selection in the gallery might have been modified.
It was with no small annoyance, therefore, that, after the Litany
was over, and the tuning finished, she heard the clerk give out
that they would praise God by singing part of the ninety-first
Psalm. Mary, who was on the tiptoe of expectation as to what was
coming, saw the curate give a slight shrug with his shoulders
and lift of his eyebrows as he left the reading-desk, and in another
minute it became a painful effort for her to keep from laughing
as she slyly watched her cousin's face; while the gallery sang
with vigour worthy of any cause or occasion&mdash;</p>

<p>   "On the old lion He shall go,    The adder fell and long;   
On the young lion tread also,    With dragons stout and strong."</p>

<p>The trebles took up the last line, and repeated&mdash;</p>

<p>   "With dragons stout and strong;"</p>

<p>and then the whole strength of the gallery chorused again&mdash;</p>

<p>   "With <em>dra-gons</em> stout and strong;"</p>

<p>and the bass-viol seemed to her to prolong the notes and to gloat
over them as he droned them out, looking triumphantly at the distant
curate. Mary was thankful to kneel down to compose her face. The
first trial was the severe one, and she got through the second
psalm much better; and by the time Mr. Walker had plunged fairly
into his sermon she was a model of propriety and sedateness again.
But it was to be a Sunday of adventures. The sermon had scarcely
begun when there was a stir down by the door at the west end,
and people began to look round and whisper. Presently a man came
softly up and said something to the clerk; the clerk jumped up
and whispered to the curate, who paused for a moment with a puzzled
look, and, instead of finishing his sentence, said in a loud voice,
"Farmer Groves' house is on fire!"</p>

<p>The curate probably anticipated the effect of his words; in a
minute he was the only person left in the church except the clerk
and one or two very infirm old folk. He shut up and pocketed his
sermon, and followed his flock.</p>

<p>It proved luckily to be only Farmer Groves' chimney and not his
house which was on fire. The farmhouse was only two fields from
the village, and the congregation rushed across there, Harry Winburn
and two or three of the most active young men and boys leading.
As they entered the yard, the flames were rushing out of the chimney,
and any moment the thatch might take fire. Here was the real danger.
A ladder had just been raised against the chimney, and, while
a frightened farm-girl and a carter-boy held it at the bottom,
a man was going up it carrying a bucket of water. It shook with
his weight, and the top was slipping gradually along the face
of the chimney, and in another moment would rest against nothing.
Harry and his companions saw the danger at a glance, and shouted
to the man to stand still till they could get to the ladder. They
rushed towards him with the rush which men can only make under
strong excitement. The foremost of them caught a spoke with one
hand, but before he could steady it, the top slipped clear of
the chimney, and, ladder, man, and bucket came heavily to the
ground.</p>

<p>Then came a scene of bewildering confusion, as women and children
trooped into the yard&mdash;"Who was it?"</p>

<p>"Was he dead?"</p>

<p>"The fire was catching the thatch."</p>

<p>"The stables were on fire."</p>

<p>"Who did it?"&mdash;all sorts of cries and all sorts of acts except
the right ones. Fortunately two or three of the men, with heads
on their shoulders, soon organized a line for handling buckets;
the flue was stopped below, and Harry Winburn standing nearly
at the top of the ladder, which was now safely planted, was deluging
the thatch round the chimney from the buckets handed up to him.
In a few minutes he was able to pour water down the chimney itself,
and soon afterwards the whole affair was at an end. The farmer's
dinner was spoilt, but otherwise no damage had been done, except
to the clothes of the foremost men; and the only accident was
that first fall from the ladder.</p>

<p>The man had been carried out of the yard while the fire was still
burning; so that it was hardly known who it was.</p>

<p>Now, in answer to their inquiries, it proved to be old Simon,
the rector's gardener and head man, who had seen the fire, and
sent the news to the church, while he himself went to the spot,
with such result as we have seen.</p>

<p>The surgeon had not yet seen him. Some declared he was dead;
others, that he was sitting up at home, and quite well. Little
by little the crowd dispersed to Sunday's dinners; when they met
again before the afternoon's service, it was ascertained that
Simon was certainly not dead, but all else was still nothing more
than rumor. Public opinion was much divided, some holding that
it would go hard with a man of his age and heft; but the common
belief seemed to be that he was of that sort "as'd take a deal
o' killin'," and that he would be none the worse for such a fall
as that.</p>

<p>The two young ladies had been much shocked at the accident, and
had accompanied the hurdle on which old Simon was carried to his
cottage door; after afternoon service they went round by the cottage
to inquire. The two girls knocked at the door, which was opened
by his wife, who dropped a curtsey and smoothed down her Sunday
apron when she found who were her visitors.</p>

<p>She seemed at first a little unwilling to let them in; but Miss
Winter pressed so kindly to see her husband, and Mary made such
sympathizing eyes at her, that the old woman gave in, and conducted
them through the front room into that beyond, where the patient
lay.</p>

<p>"I hope as you'll excuse it, miss, for I knows the place do smell
terrible bad of baccer; only my old man he said as how-"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind, we don't care at all about the smell. Poor Simon!
I'm sure if it does him any good, or soothes the pain, I shall
be glad to buy him some tobacco myself."</p>

<p>The old man was lying on the bed, with his coat and boots off,
and a worsted nightcap of his wife's knitting pulled on to his
head. She had tried hard to get him to go to bed at once, and
take some physic, and his present costume and position was the
compromise. His back was turned to them as they entered, and he
was evidently in pain, for he drew his breath heavily and with
difficulty, and gave a sort of groan at every respiration. He
did not seem to notice their entrance; so his wife touched him
on the shoulder, and said, "Simon, here's the young ladies come
to see how you be."</p>

<p>Simon turned himself round, and winced and groaned as he pulled
off his nightcap in token of respect.</p>

<p>"We didn't like to go home without coming to see how you were,
Simon. Has the doctor been?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, thank'ee, miss. He've a been and feel'd un all over,
and listened at the chest on un," said his wife.</p>

<p>"And what did he say?"</p>

<p>"He zem'd to zay as there wur no bwones bruk&mdash;ugh, ugh," put
in Simon, who spoke his native tongue with a buzz, imported from
farther west, "but a couldn't zay wether or no there warn't som
infarnal injury-"</p>

<p>"Etarnal, Simon, etarnal!" interrupted his wife; "how canst use
such words afore the young ladies?"</p>

<p>"I tell'ee wife, as 'twur infarnal&mdash;ugh, ugh," retorted the gardener.</p>

<p>"Internal injury?" suggested Miss Winter. "I'm very sorry to
hear it."</p>

<p>"Zummut inside o' me like, as wur got out o' place," explained
Simon; "and I thenks a must be near about the mark, for I feels
mortal bad here when I tries to move;" and he put his hand on
his side. "Hows'm'ever, as there's no bwones bruk, I hopes to
be about to-morrow mornin', please the Lord&mdash;ugh, ugh."</p>

<p>"You mustn't think of it, Simon," said Miss Winter. "You must
be quite quiet for a week, at least, till you get rid of this
pain."</p>

<p>"So I tells un, Miss Winter," put in the wife. "You hear what
the young missus says, Simon?"</p>

<p>"And wut's to happen to Tiny?" said the contumacious Simon, scornfully.
"Her'll cast her calf, and me not by. Her's calving maybe this
minut. Tiny's time were up, miss, two days back, and her's never
no gurt while arter her time."</p>

<p>"She will do very well, I dare say," said Miss Winter, "One of
the men can look after her."</p>

<p>The notion of anyone else attending Tiny in her interesting situation
seemed to excite Simon beyond bearing, for he raised himself on
one elbow, and was about to make a demonstration with his other
hand, when the pain seized him again, and he sank back groaning.</p>

<p>"There, you see, Simon, you can't move without pain. You must
be quiet till you have seen the doctor again."</p>

<p>"There's the red spider out along the south wall&mdash;ugh, ugh,"
persisted Simon, without seeming to hear her; "and your new g'raniums
a'most covered wi' blight. I wur a tacklin' one of 'em just afore
you cum in."</p>

<p>Following the direction indicated by his nod, the girls became
aware of a plant by his bedside, which he had been fumigating,
for his pipe was leaning against the flower-pot in which it stood.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't lie still nohow, miss," explained his wife, "till
I went and fetched un in a pipe and one o' thaay plants from the
greenhouse."</p>

<p>"It was very thoughtful of you, Simon," said Miss Winter; "you
know how much I prize these new plants; but we will manage them;
and you mustn't think of these things now. You have had a wonderful
escape to-day for a man of your age. I hope we shall find that
there is nothing much the matter with you after a few days, but
you might have been killed you know. You ought to be very thankful
to God that you were not killed in that fall."</p>

<p>"So I be, miss, werry thankful to un&mdash;ugh, ugh;&mdash;and if it please
the Lord to spare my life till to-morrow mornin',&mdash;ugh, ugh,&mdash;we'll
smoke them cussed insects."</p>

<p>This last retort of the incorrigible Simon on her cousin's attempt,
as the rector's daughter, to improve the occasion, was too much
for Miss Mary, and she slipped out of the room, lest she should
bring disgrace on herself by an explosion of laughter. She was
joined by her cousin in another minute, and the two walked together
toward the Rectory.</p>

<p>"I hope you were not faint, dear, with that close room, smelling
of smoke?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no; to tell you the truth, I was only afraid of laughing
at your quaint old patient. What a rugged old dear he is. I hope
he isn't much hurt."</p>

<p>"I hope not, indeed; for he is the most honest, faithful old
servant in the world, but so obstinate. He never will go to church
on Sunday mornings; and, when I speak to him about it, he says
papa doesn't go, which is very wrong and impertinent of him."</p>
