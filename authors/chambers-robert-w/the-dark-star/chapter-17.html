<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was in mid-ocean that Neeland finally came to the conclusion
that nobody on board the <em>Volhynia</em> was likely to bother
him or his box.</p>

<p>The July weather had been magnificent&mdash;blue skies, a gentle wind,
and a sea scarcely silvered by a comber.</p>

<p>Assorted denizens of the Atlantic took part in the traditional
vaudeville performance for the benefit of the <em>Volhynia</em>
passengers; gulls followed the wake to mid-ocean; Mother Carey's
chickens skimmed the baby billows; dolphins turned watery flip-flaps
under the bows; and even a distant whale consented to oblige.</p>

<p>Everybody pervaded the decks morning, noon, and evening; the
most squeamish recovered confidence in twenty-four hours; and
every constitutional lubber concluded he was a born sailor.</p>

<p>Neeland really was one; no nausea born from the bad adjustment
of that anatomical auricular gyroscope recently discovered in
man ever disturbed his abdominal nerves. Short of shipwreck, he
enjoyed any entertainment the Atlantic offered him.</p>

<p>So he was always on deck, tranquilly happy and with nothing in
the world to disturb him except his responsibility for the olive-wood
box.</p>

<p>He dared not leave it in his locked cabin; he dared not entrust
it to anybody; he lugged it about with him wherever he went. On
deck it stood beside his steamer chair; it dangled from his hand
when he promenaded, exciting the amazement and curiosity of others;
it reposed on the floor under the table and beneath his attentive
feet when he was at meals.</p>

<p>These elaborate precautions indicated his wholesome respect for
the persistence of Scheherazade and her friends; he was forever
scanning his fellow-voyagers at table, in the smoking room, and
as they strolled to and fro in front of his steamer chair, trying
to make up his mind concerning them.</p>

<p>But Neeland, a clever observer of externals, was no reader of
character. The passenger list never seemed to confirm any conclusions
he arrived at concerning any of the passengers on the <em>Volhynia</em>.
A gentleman he mistook for an overfed broker turned out to be
a popular clergyman with outdoor proclivities; a slim, poetic-looking
youth who carried a copy of "Words and Wind" about the deck travelled
for the Gold Leaf Lard Company.</p>

<p>Taking them all in all, Neeland concluded that they were as harmless
a collection of <em>reconcentrados</em> as he had ever observed;
and he was strongly tempted to leave the box in his locked stateroom.</p>

<p>He decided to do so one afternoon after luncheon, and, lugging
his box, started to return to his stateroom with that intention,
instead of going on deck, as usual, for a postprandial cigarette.</p>

<p>There was nobody in the main corridor as he passed, but in the
short, carpeted passage leading to his stateroom he caught a glimpse
of a white serge skirt vanishing into the stateroom opposite to
his, and heard the door close and the noise of a key turned quickly.</p>

<p>His steward, being questioned on the first day out, had told
him that this stateroom was occupied by an invalid gentleman travelling
alone, who preferred to remain there instead of trusting to his
crutches on a temperamental deck.</p>

<p>Neeland, passing the closed and curtained door, wondered whether
the invalid had made a hit, or whether he had a relative aboard
who wore a white serge skirt, white stockings and shoes, and was
further endowed with agreeable ankles.</p>

<p>He fitted his key to his door, turned it, withdrew the key to
pocket it; and immediately became aware that the end of the key
was sticky.</p>

<p>He entered the stateroom, however, and bolted the door, then
he sat down on his sofa and examined his fingers and his door
key attentively. There was wax sticking to both.</p>

<p>When he had fully digested this fact he wiped and pocketed his
key and cast a rather vacant look around the little stateroom.
And immediately his eye was arrested by a white object lying on
the carpet between the bed and the sofa&mdash;a woman's handkerchief,
without crest or initials, but faintly scented.</p>

<p>After he became tired of alternately examining it and sniffing
it, he put it in his pocket and began an uneasy tour of his room.</p>

<p>If it had been entered and ransacked, everything had been replaced
exactly as he had left it, as well as he could remember. Nothing
excepting this handkerchief and the wax on the key indicated intrusion;
nothing, apparently, had been disturbed; and yet there was the
handkerchief; and there was the wax on the end of his door key.</p>

<p>"Here's a fine business!" he muttered to himself; and rang for
his steward.</p>

<p>The man came&mdash;a cockney, dense as his native fog&mdash;who maintained
that nobody could have entered the stateroom without his knowledge
or the knowledge of the stewardess.</p>

<p>"Do you think <em>she's</em> been in my cabin?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Call her."</p>

<p>The stewardess, an alert, intelligent little woman with a trace
of West Indian blood in her, denied entering his stateroom. Shown
the handkerchief and invited to sniff it, she professed utter
ignorance concerning it, assured him that no lady in her section
used that perfume, and offered to show it to the stewardesses
of other sections on the chance of their identifying the perfume
or the handkerchief.</p>

<p>"All right," said Neeland; "take it. But bring it back. And here's
a sovereign. And&mdash;one thing more. If anybody pays you to deceive
me, come to me and I'll outbid them. Is that a bargain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she said unblushingly.</p>

<p>When she had gone away with the handkerchief, Neeland closed
the door again and said to the steward:</p>

<p>"Keep an eye on my door. I am positive that somebody has taken
a wax impression of the keyhole. What I said to that stewardess
also holds good with you. I'll outbid anybody who bribes you."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Sure it's good! It's devilish good. Here's a beautiful and newly
minted gold sovereign. Isn't it artistic? It's yours, steward."</p>

<p>"Thanky, sir."</p>

<p>"Not at all. And, by the way, what's that invalid gentleman's
name?"</p>

<p>"'Awks, sir."</p>

<p>"Hawks?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; Mr. 'Erbert 'Awks."</p>

<p>"American?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"British?"</p>

<p>"Shall I inquire, sir?" starting to go.</p>

<p>"Not of <em>him</em>! Don't be a lunatic, steward! Please try
to understand that I want nothing said about this matter or about
my inquiries."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well, then! Find out, if you can, who Mr. Herbert Hawks
is. Find out all you can concerning him. It's easy money, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment. Has he any friends or relatives on board?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, no friends, eh? No ladies who wear white serge skirts and
white shoes and stockings?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, not as I knows of."</p>

<p>"Oh! Suppose you step across to his door, knock, and ask him
if he rang. And, if the door is opened, take a quick slant at
the room."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>Neeland, his door at the crack, watched the steward cross the
corridor and knock at the door of Mr. Herbert Hawks.</p>

<p>"Well, what iss it?" came a heavy voice from within.</p>

<p>"Mr. 'Awks, sir, did you ring?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not."</p>

<p>"Oh, beg pardon, sir&#11834;"</p>

<p>The steward was starting to return to Neeland, but that young
man motioned him violently away from his door and closed it. Then,
listening, his ear against the panel, he presently heard a door
in the passage creak open a little way, then close again, stealthily.</p>

<p>He possessed his soul in patience, believing that Mr. Hawks or
his fair friend in the white skirt had merely taken a preliminary
survey of the passage and perhaps also of his closed door. But
the vigil was vain; the door did not reopen; no sound came from
the stateroom across the passageway.</p>

<p>To make certain that the owner of the white shoes and stockings
did not leave that stateroom without his knowledge, he opened
his door with many precautions and left it on the crack, stretching
a rubber band from knob to bolt, so that the wind from the open
port in the passage should not blow it shut. Then, drawing his
curtain, he sat down to wait.</p>

<p>He had a book, one of those slobbering American novels which
serve up falsehood thickly buttered with righteousness and are
consumed by the morally sterilised.</p>

<p>And, as he smoked he read; and, as he read he listened. One eye
always remained on duty; one ear was alert; he meant to see who
was the owner of the white shoes if it took the remainder of the
voyage to find out.</p>

<p>The book aided him as a commonplace accompaniment aids a soloist&mdash;alternately
boring and exasperating him.</p>

<p>It was an "uplift" book, where the heroine receives whacks with
patient smiles. Fate boots her from pillar to post and she blesses
Fate and is much obliged. That most deadly reproach to degenerate
human nature&mdash;the accidental fact of sex&mdash;had been so skilfully
extirpated from those pages that, like chaste amoeb√¶, the characters
merely multiplied by immaculate subdivision; and millions of lineal
descendants of the American Dodo were made gleeful for $1.50 net.</p>

<p>It was hard work waiting, harder work reading, but between the
two and a cigarette now and then Neeland managed to do his sentry
go until dinner time approached and the corridors resounded with
the trample of the hungry.</p>

<p>The stewardess reappeared a little later and returned to him
his handkerchief and the following information:</p>

<p>Mr. Hawks, it appeared, travelled with a trained nurse, whose
stateroom was on another deck. That nurse was not in her stateroom,
but a similar handkerchief was, scented with similar perfume.</p>

<p>"You're a wonder," said Neeland, placing some more sovereigns
in her palm and closing her fingers over them. "What is the nurse's
name?"</p>

<p>"Miss White."</p>

<p>"Very suitable name. Has she ever before visited Herr &mdash;I
mean <em>Mr.</em> &mdash;Hawks in his stateroom?"</p>

<p>"Her stewardess says she has been indisposed since we left New
York."</p>

<p>"Hasn't been out of her cabin?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I see. Did you inquire what she looked like?"</p>

<p>"Her stewardess couldn't be certain. The stateroom was kept dark
and the tray containing her meals was left at the bedside. Miss
White smokes."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Neeland reflectively, "she smokes Red Light cigarettes,
I believe. Thank you, very much. More sovereigns if you are discreet.
And say to my steward that I'll dine in my stateroom. Soup, fish,
meat, any old thing you can think of. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, sir."</p>

<p>When she had withdrawn he kneeled down on his sofa and looked
out through the port at the sunset sea.</p>

<p>There was a possibility that Scheherazade and her friends might
be on board the <em>Volhynia</em>. Who else would be likely to
take wax impressions of his keyhole and leave a scented scrap
of a handkerchief on his stateroom floor?</p>

<p>That they had kept themselves not only out of sight but off the
passenger list merely corroborated suspicion. That's what they'd
be likely to do.</p>

<p>And now there was no question in his mind of leaving the box
in his cabin. He'd cling to it like a good woman to alimony. Death
alone could separate his box from him.</p>

<p>As he knelt there, sniffing the salt perfume of the sea, his
ears on duty detected the sound of a tray in the corridor.</p>

<p>"Leave it on the camp-table outside my door!" he said over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>He was not hungry; he was thinking too hard.</p>

<p>"Confound it," he thought to himself, "am I to squat here in
ambush for the rest of the trip?"</p>

<p>The prospect was not agreeable for a man who loved the sea. All
day and most of the starry night the hurricane deck called to
him, and his whole anatomy responded. And now to sit hunched up
here like a rat in the hold was not to his taste. Suppose he should
continue to frequent the deck, carrying with him his box, of course.
He might never discover who owned the white serge skirt or who
owned the voice which pronounced is as "iss."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it occurred to him that for a quarter of an hour or
more his dinner outside his door had been growing colder and colder.
So he slid from the sofa, unstrapped the rubber band, opened the
door, lifted table and tray into his stateroom with a sharp glance
at the opposite door, and, readjusting the rubber band, composed
himself to eat.</p>
