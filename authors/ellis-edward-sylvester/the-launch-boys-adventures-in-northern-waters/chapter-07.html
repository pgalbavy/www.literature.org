<p>Had the large man undergone the scientific training of the smaller
one, he might have overcome him, for, as has been said, he was
immensely powerful and must have been a third heavier than Stockham
Calvert. But he was out of condition, and, worse than all for
him, had not the slightest knowledge of the "manly art." When
he doubled his huge hairy fists, he charged upon the detective
like a roaring bull, expecting to beat down his smaller antagonist
as if he were pulp.</p>

<p>The pose of the defendant was perfect. Resting easily on his
right foot, the left advanced and gently touching the ground,
he could leap forward, backward or to one side with the agility
of a panther. The left fist was held something more than a foot
beyond the chest, the elbow slightly crooked, while the right
forearm crossed the breast diagonally at a distance of a few inches.
This is the true position, and the combatant who knows his business
always looks straight into the eyes of his opponent. The arms
and body are thus in his field of vision, whereas if he once glances
elsewhere he lays himself open to a sudden blow.</p>

<p>With that alertness which becomes second nature to a pugilist,
Calvert saw before the first demonstration that his foe had no
knowledge whatever of defending himself. He allowed him to make
a single rush, his big fists and arms sawing space like a windmill.
He struck twice, swishing the air in front of Calvert's face,
and gathered himself to strike again, when&#11834;</p>

<p>Not one of the three spectators could ever describe how it was
done, for the action was too quick for the eye to follow. But,
all the same, that metal-like left fist shot forward with the
speed of lightning, and landing on the point of the chin, the
recipient went down like an ox stricken by the axe of a butcher.
Rather curiously, he did not fall backward, but lurched forward
and lay senseless, knocked out in the first round.</p>

<p>"You have killed him!" whispered the scared Captain.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, but he will be dead to the world for ten or
fifteen minutes. We may as well let him rest in peace. What's
become of that dog?" asked the officer, glancing inquiringly around.</p>

<p>Chester pointed toward the house. The brute, with his two inches
of tail aimed skyward, was scooting around the corner of the building
as fast as his bowed legs could carry him. He would not have done
so had he been of true bulldog breed, but being a mongrel, there
was a big streak of yellow in his make-up.</p>

<p>"He's come to the belief that it's a good time to adjourn, as
me cousin said whin someone blowed up the stump on which he was
risting his weary body."</p>

<p>"I think we have had enough foraging along the river," remarked
Captain Alvin, who re-entered the boat and resumed his place at
the wheel. "We dine at Wiscasset."</p>

<p>"I'm not partic'lar as to the place," said Mike, "if only we
dine."</p>

<p>Chester flung the loop of rope off the support, and he and the
others stepped aboard the launch, which moved up the river. Standing
in front of the detective, Mike, with his genial grin, offered
his hand:</p>

<p>"I asks the privilege of a shake of yours. I apologize for thinking
ye didn't like a shindy as well as the rest of us. I'm sorry for
me mistake, as me uncle said, whin he inthroodoced dad to a party
of leddies as a gintleman. I couldn't have done better mesilf."</p>

<p>The smiling officer cordially accepted the proffer.</p>

<p>"No one can doubt your pluck, Mike, but, to quote your favorite
method of expressing yourself, you showed mighty poor judgment,
as the owner of the bull said when the animal tried to butt a
locomotive off the track. That man would have eaten you up."</p>

<p>"P-raps, but he would have found me hard to digist. Do ye obsarve?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the little landing which they were leaving behind
them. All looked and saw the burly brute of a man slowly rise
to a sitting posture, with his hat off and his frowsy hair in
his eyes, as he stared confusedly after the launch speeding up
the river.</p>

<p>"He is recovering quicker than I expected," was the only remark
Calvert made, as he turned his back upon the fellow and gave his
attention to lighting another cigar.</p>

<p>"He has the look of a fellow mixed and confused like, similar
to Pat McGuigan, whin he dived off the dock and his head and shoulders
wint through a lobster pot that he didn't obsarve in time to avoid
the same."</p>

<p>"He's coming round all right," said Calvert, referring to the
man they had left behind, though he did not glance at him. "He
may not be very pretty, but he knows more than he did a little
while ago. Which reminds me to say something that ought to have
been said at our first interview."</p>

<p>The three listened to the words of Calvert, who clearly was in
earnest.</p>

<p>"Each of you knows that I am a professional detective who has
been sent into Maine to do all I can to capture the gang that
is robbing the post offices in this section. I told you that much,
but I wish to ask you to be very, very careful not to say this
to any person whom you may meet, until you have my permission
to do so. Some would insist that it was unprofessional on my part
to say what I did, but I had good reason for it, as will appear
before I am through with the business."</p>

<p>"It was not necessary to tell Chester and me that, but I suppose
you wish to run no risk that can be avoided."</p>

<p>"That's it; I did not doubt your loyalty, but you know we can't
be too careful."</p>

<p>Mike was leaning back in his chair deeply thinking.</p>

<p>"There's one waak p'int in the plan suggisted."</p>

<p>Inasmuch as no one had submitted a plan the three wondered.</p>

<p>"Me friend doesn't wish us to tell anyone that he's the best
detictive and scrapper outside of our family in Ireland, but when
folks priss their questions, some answer must be given or 'spicions
will be stirred."</p>

<p>"The point is well taken. I don't wish you to tell an untruth&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'm sure the task is not difficult fur the Captain and second
mate," interrupted Mike, "though it's beyond me."</p>

<p>"But you can evade a direct reply."</p>

<p>"May I vinture upon another suggistion?" asked Mike.</p>

<p>"We shall all be glad to hear it, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Without waiting for questions to be asked, I'll step up to ivery
one that I obsarve casting an inquiring eye over ye and say ye're
my older brither, that took a hand in the Phoenix Park murders,
but broke out of Dublin jail and thus escaped hanging, and yer
kaaping dark in Ameriky till the little matter blows over."</p>

<p>"A brilliant idea!" laughed the officer. "All I ask is that you
give no truthful information about me."</p>

<p>"Ye doesn't objict to my telling folks how ye laid out that Goliah
a bit ago?"</p>

<p>"I prefer you should not mention it."</p>

<p>Mike sighed.</p>

<p>"Ah, have ye no pride of family, as Tam O'Toole used to say whin
mintioning the fact that all his five brithers were in jail, where
Tarn himsilf ought to have been?"</p>

<p>"I may add," continued the man, "that it is quite likely we shall
soon part company."</p>

<p>Mike affected to be surprised.</p>

<p>"Doesn't the Captain pay ye 'nough wages?"</p>

<p>"I have no fault to find on that score."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to larn that. If he requires ye to do too much dooty,
I'll hilp ye out, the bist I can."</p>

<p>"I promise to call upon you if necessary, Mike, but I hope I
shall not be obliged to do so."</p>

<p>"I have been wondering since we started," said Alvin over his
shoulder, "whether by any possibility the <em>Water Witch</em>
kept on up the river ahead of us instead of running into some
bay or inlet to the south."</p>

<p>"It is possible, but not probable. You know we had an extended
view of this stream, or rather of Montsweag Bay, and she could
not have gone far enough in the short time to pass out of sight."</p>

<p>"Ye forgits how anxious the Captain was not to overtake her,"
reminded Mike. "I once read of a farmer who chased a big black
bear that had been staaling his sheep fur two days and nights
and then quit. Can ye guess why?"</p>

<p>"I should say that after so long a chase he would have given
up disgusted," replied the detective.</p>

<p>"It was not that; it was 'cause he found the tracks were becooming
too fresh."</p>

<p>"I don't think, Mike, that you are in danger of being accused
of that," ventured Chester, "because you are always fresh&mdash;you
are never <em>becoming</em> so."</p>

<p>"But the same is becooming to me, as Jim Flannery said whin he
walked into church wid two black eyes and his head bent out of
shape from the shindy he had with his twin brither over the quistion
of aiting maat on Friday."</p>

<p>"You seem quite sure that these three whom we saw in the launch
are mixed up in these post office robberies?" asked Alvin.</p>

<p>"It has that look. No matter how certain I may feel, nothing
can be accomplished until legal proof is obtained. You know the
rule that every man must be presumed to be innocent until proved
guilty."</p>

<p>"It shtrikes me that the most important quistion of all has been
sittled."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"These two young gintlemen are the spalpeens that tried to hold
ye up, Captain, the ither night on yer way home. That fur outweighs
the taking of a few postage stamps from some country offices."</p>

<p>"The puzzling feature of that business," said Alvin, "is that
when you meet those two fellows again, you will not have Mr. Calvert
along to protect you."</p>

<p>Mike stared as if he failed to catch the meaning of this astounding
remark.</p>

<p>"Plaise say that agin, Captain, and say it slow like."</p>

<p>Alvin's face being turned away, he was not forced to maintain
his gravity while he repeated in his most serious tones the remark
quoted.</p>

<p>"All I have to say to that is not to say anything, as Teddy Geoghan
observed whin they found a stolen pig in the bag he was carrying
over his shoulder which the same he insisted was filled with clothes
for Widow Mulligan."</p>
