You must picture Mr. Thomas Marvel as a person of copious, flexible
visage, a nose of cylindrical protrusion, a liquorish, ample,
fluctuating mouth, and a beard of bristling eccentricity.  His figure
inclined to embonpoint; his short limbs accentuated this inclination.
He wore a furry silk hat, and the frequent substitution of twine and
shoe-laces for buttons, apparent at critical points of his costume,
marked a man essentially bachelor.
<P>
Mr. Thomas Marvel was sitting with his feet in a ditch by the
roadside over the down toward Adderdean, about a mile and a half out
of Iping.  His feet, save for socks of irregular openwork, were bare,
his big toes were broad, and pricked like the ears of a watchful dog.
In a leisurely manner--he did everything in a leisurely manner--he
was contemplating trying on a pair of boots.  They were the soundest
boots he had come across for a long time, but too large for him;
whereas the ones he had were, in dry weather, a very comfortable fit,
but too thin-soled for damp.  Mr. Thomas Marvel hated roomy boots,
but then he hated damp.  He had never properly thought out which he
hated most, and it was a pleasant day, and there was nothing better
to do.  So he put the four boots in a graceful group on the turf and
looked at them.  And seeing them there among the grass and springing
agrimony, it suddenly occurred to him that both pairs were
exceedingly ugly to see.  He was not at all startled by a voice
behind him.
<P>
"They're boots, anyhow," said the voice.
<P>
"They are--charity boots," said Mr. Thomas Marvel, with his head on
one side regarding them distastefully; "and which is the ugliest pair
in the whole blessed universe, I'm darned if I know!"
<P>
"H'm," said the voice.
<P>
"I've worn worse--in fact, I've worn none.  But none so owdacious
ugly--if you'll allow the expression.  I've been cadging boots--in
particular--for days.  Because I was sick of them.  They're sound
enough, of course.  But a gentleman on tramp sees such a thundering
lot of his boots.  And if you'll believe me, I've raised nothing in
the whole blessed county, try as I would, but THEM.  Look at 'em!
And a good county for boots, too, in a general way.  But it's just my
promiscuous luck.  I've got my boots in this county ten years or
more.  And then they treat you like this."
<P>
"It's a beast of a county," said the voice.  "And pigs for people."
<P>
"Ain't it?" said Mr. Thomas Marvel.  "Lord!  But them boots!  It
beats it."
<P>
He turned his head over his shoulder to the right, to look at the
boots of his interlocutor with a view to comparisons, and lo!  where
the boots of his interlocutor should have been were neither legs nor
boots.  He turned his head over his shoulder to the left, and there
also were neither legs nor boots.  He was irradiated by the dawn of a
great amazement.  "Where are yar?"  said Mr. Thomas Marvel over his
shoulder and coming round on all fours.  He saw a stretch of empty
downs with the wind swaying and remote green-pointed furze bushes.
<P>
"Am I drunk?" said Mr. Marvel.  "Have I had visions?  Was I talking
to myself?  What the--"
<P>
"Don't be alarmed," said a voice.
<P>
"None of your ventriloquising me," said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rising
sharply to his feet.  "Where are yer?  Alarmed, indeed!"
<P>
"Don't be alarmed," repeated the voice.
<P>
"You'll be alarmed in a minute, you silly fool," said Mr.  Thomas
Marvel.  "Where are yer?  Lemme get my mark on yer--
<P>
"Are you buried?" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, after an interval.
<P>
There was no answer.  Mr. Thomas Marvel stood bootless and amazed,
his jacket nearly thrown off.
<P>
"Peewit," said a peewit, very remote.
<P>
"Peewit, indeed!" said Mr. Thomas Marvel.  "This ain't no time for
foolery."  The down was desolate, east and west, north and south; the
road with its shallow ditches and white bordering stakes, ran smooth
and empty north and south, and, save for that peewit, the blue sky
was empty too.  "So help me," said Mr. Thomas Marvel, shuffling his
coat on to his shoulders again.  "It's the drink!  I might ha'
known."
<P>
"It's not the drink," said the voice.  "You keep your nerves steady."
<P>
"Ow!" said Mr. Marvel, and his face grew white amidst its patches.
"It's the drink," his lips repeated noiselessly.  He remained staring
about him, rotating slowly backwards.  "I could have swore I heard a
voice," he whispered.
<P>
"Of course you did."
<P>
"It's there again," said Mr. Marvel, closing his eyes and clasping
his hand on his brow with a tragic gesture.  He was suddenly taken by
the collar and shaken violently and left more dazed than ever.
"Don't be a fool," said the voice.
<P>
"I'm--off--my--blooming--chump," said Mr. Marvel.  "It's no good.
It's fretting about them blarsted boots.  I'm off my blessed blooming
chump.  Or it's spirits."
<P>
"Neither one thing nor the other," said the voice.  "Listen!"
<P>
"Chump," said Mr. Marvel.
<P>
"One minute," said the voice penetratingly,--tremulous with
self-control.
<P>
"Well?" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, with a strange feeling of having been
dug in the chest by a finger.
<P>
"You think I'm just imagination?  Just imagination?"
<P>
"What else can you be?" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rubbing the back of
his neck.
<P>
"Very well," said the voice, in a tone of relief.  "Then I'm going to
throw flints at you till you think differently."
<P>
"But where are yer?"
<P>
The voice made no answer.  Whiz came a flint, apparently out of the
air, and missed Mr. Marvel's shoulder by a hair's breadth.  Mr.
Marvel, turning, saw a flint jerk up into the air, trace a
complicated path, hang for a moment, and then fling at his feet with
almost invisible rapidity.  He was too amazed to dodge.  Whiz it
came, and ricocheted from a bare toe into the ditch.  Mr. Thomas
Marvel jumped a foot and howled aloud.  Then he started to run,
tripped over an unseen obstacle, and came head over heels into a
sitting position.
<P>
"Now," said the voice, as a third stone curved upward and hung in the
air above the tramp.  "Am I imagination?"
<P>
Mr. Marvel by way of reply struggled to his feet, and was immediately
rolled over again.  He lay quiet for a moment.  "If you struggle any
more," said the voice, "I shall throw the flint at your head."
<P>
"It's a fair do," said Mr. Thomas Marvel, sitting up, taking his
wounded toe in hand and fixing his eye on the third missle.  "I don't
understand it.  Stones flinging themselves.  Stones talking.  Put
yourself down.  Rot away.  I'm done."
<P>
The third flint fell.
<P>
"It's very simple," said the voice.  "I'm an invisible man."
<P>
"Tell us something I don't know," said Mr. Marvel, gasping with pain.
"Where you've hid--how you do it--I don't know, I'm beat."
<P>
"That's all," said the voice.  "I'm invisible.  That's what I want
you to understand."
<P>
"Any one could see that.  There is no need for you to be so
confounded impatient, mister.  Now then.  Give us a notion.  How are
you hid?"
<P>
"I'm invisible.  That's the great point.  And what I want you to
understand is this--"
<P>
"But whereabouts?" interrupted Mr. Marvel.
<P>
"Here!  Six yards in front of you."
<P>
"Oh, come!  I ain't blind.  You'll be telling me next you're just
thin air.  I'm not one of your ignorant tramps--"
<P>
"Yes, I am--thin air.  You're looking through me."
<P>
"What!  Ain't there any stuff to you?  Vox et--what is it?-- jabber.
Is it that?
<P>
"I am just a human being--solid, needing food and drink, needing
covering too--But I'm invisible.  You see?  Invisible.  Simple idea.
Invisible."
<P>
"What, real like?"
<P>
"Yes, real."
<P>
"Let's have a hand of you," said Marvel, "if you are real.  It won't
be so darn out-of-the-way like, then--Lord!" he said, "how you made
me jump!--gripping me like that!"
<P>
He felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged
fingers, and his touch went timorously up the arm, patted a muscular
chest, and explored a bearded face.  Marvel's face was astonishment.
<P>
"I'm dashed!" he said.  "If this don't beat cock-fighting!  Most
remarkable!--And there I can see a rabbit clean through you, 'arf a
mile away!  Not a bit of you visible--except--"
<P>
He scrutinised the apparently empty space keenly.  "You 'aven't been
eatin' bread and cheese?" he asked, holding the invisible arm.
<P>
"You're quite right, and it's not quite assimilated into the system."
<P>
"Ah!" said Mr. Marvel.  "Sort of ghostly, though."
<P>
"Of course, all this isn't so wonderful as you think."
<P>
"It's quite wonderful enough for my modest wants," said Mr.  Thomas
Marvel.  "Howjer manage it?  How the dooce is it done?"
<P>
"It's too long a story.  And besides--"
<P>
"I tell you, the whole business fair beats me," said Mr.  Marvel.
<P>
"What I want to say at present is this: I need help.  I have come to
that--I came upon you suddenly.  I was wandering, mad with rage,
naked, impotent.  I could have murdered.  And I saw you--"
<P>
"Lord!" said Mr. Marvel.
<P>
"I came up behind you--hesitated--went on--"
<P>
Mr. Marvel's expression was eloquent.
<P>
"--then stopped.  'Here,' I said, 'is an outcast like myself.  This
is the man for me.'  So I turned back and came to you--you.  And--"
<P>
"Lord!" said Mr. Marvel.  "But I'm all in a dizzy.  May I ask--How is
it?  And what you may be requiring in the way of help?-- Invisible!"
<P>
"I want you to help me get clothes--and shelter--and then, with other
things.  I've left them long enough.  If you won't--well!  But you
will--must."
<P>
"Look here," said Mr. Marvel.  "I'm too flabbergasted.  Don't knock
me about any more.  And leave me go.  I must get steady a bit.  And
you've pretty near broken my toe.  It's all so unreasonable.  Empty
downs, empty sky.  Nothing visible for miles except the bosom of
Nature.  And then comes a voice.  A voice out of heaven!  And stones!
And a fist--Lord!"
<P>
"Pull yourself together," said the voice, "for you have to do the job
I've chosen for you."
<P>
Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks, and his eyes were round.
<P>
"I've chosen you," said the voice.  "You are the only man, except
some of those fools down there, who knows there is such a thing as an
invisible man.  You have to be my helper.  Help me--and I will do
great things for you.  An invisible man is a man of power."  He
stopped for a moment to sneeze violently.
<P>
"But if you betray me," he said, "if you fail to do as I direct
you--"
<P>
He paused and tapped Mr. Marvel's shoulder smartly.  Mr.  Marvel gave
a yelp of terror at the touch.  "I don't want to betray you," said
Mr. Marvel, edging away from the direction of the fingers.  "Don't
you go a-thinking that, whatever you do.  All I want to do is to help
you--just tell me what I got to do.  (Lord!)  Whatever you want done,
that I'm most willing to do."
