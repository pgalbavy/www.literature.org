<p>Slight as was the noise made by the flashing of the powder, Deerfoot
not only heard it, but knew what it meant. He was so angered that
he bounded back among the trees like a tiger leaping upon the
hunter that has wounded him. He grasped his knife and sought the
treacherous Pawnee, with a fierceness that seemed could not be
denied.</p>

<p>Hay-uta stepped softly in the other direction, where he was under
the shadow of the trees, and waited for events to develop before
doing any thing further.</p>

<p>In the depth of the woods where the vegetation was dense, the
darkness was impenetrable. Keen as were the eyes of the Shawanoe,
they were not those of the owl or cat, and his enemy was wise
enough to remain still. So long as he did so, he was in no danger.</p>

<p>Had Deerfoot been able to find the traitor, he would have made
short work with him, but suspecting what he was doing, or rather
what he was not doing, he did not tarry. He withdrew so cautiously
that no straggling ray of moonlight could fall on his figure,
as he moved among the trees. Rejoining the Sauk, they passed down
stream.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when they stopped near the edge of the
water. There was none of the band on the open space on which the
Pawnee camp-fire had been kindled a half mile or so above, so
they were covered by all the shelter they could wish.</p>

<p>From the moment of turning their backs for the last time on the
Pawnee who had sought to shoot one of them, the Shawanoe and Sauk
had not spoken a word. They understood each other too well to
need conversation; but, remembering the click of the flint lock
and the useless flash of the powder, they made sure that no chance
was given for a second attempt.</p>

<p>The Pawnee, who understood why he failed to bring down one of
them, was wise enough to withdraw and make his way back to the
camp-fire, pondering on the road the explanation which he would
add to the store of extraordinary narratives related by his comrades,
who had been brought in contact with the young Shawanoe.</p>

<p>The sky was cloudy and the light of the moon treacherous and
uncertain. Sometimes the surface of the swiftly flowing river
in front was lighted up, and the shadowy line of wood on the other
shore stood out clear, and again it seemed to recede, when the
face of the moon was obscured.</p>

<p>It was not far to the other bank, and the Indian friends expected
to swim across, as they had done scores of times under similar
circumstances. Fully two hours had passed since they left young
Jack Carleton. During that period not the slightest sign was received
from him, and he might have been dead or a thousand miles distant,
for all that indicated the contrary.</p>

<p>And yet, it is not to be supposed that either the Sauk or Shawanoe
felt any concern for the lad. They had seen no hostiles on that
side of the stream; besides, the experience of Jack ought to have
kept him from any possible harm.</p>

<p>But the understanding was that the three were to come together
at nightfall, or as soon thereafter as possible. Consequently,
Jack would be looking for them.</p>

<p>Deerfoot and Hay-uta stood by the margin of the wood, listening
and looking. The soft murmur of the forest and the ripple of the
current, as it twisted around some gnarled root along shore or
struck against the dipping branch of a tree overhanging the water,
were the sounds which first fell on their ears. But a moment later
the wailing scream of a panther came from the depths of the wilderness,
answered a moment after by a similar cry from a point a mile away.</p>

<p>As if the night was to be given no rest, a husky whistle, like
that which a locomotive sends faintly through many miles of fog
and damp, reached their ears. Deerfoot and Hay-uta recognized
it as a signal from one of the Pawnees who were so numerous in
the neighborhood. It came from a point near where Deerfoot had
caught his first sight of the group around the camp-fire.</p>

<p>But the friends were in a section where they had never been before,
and were playing battledore and shuttlecock with a warlike tribe
of whom they knew nothing. It was impossible, therefore, for them
to understand the meaning of the signal, for whose response they
listened with close attention.</p>

<p>They were astonished that no answer was returned. They would
have heard it had there been any, but for several minutes the
stillness was unbroken. It was as if one of the Pawnees had called
to another who was too distant to be reached, and consequently
no response could be sent.</p>

<p>But the next interruption was the report of a gun, sounding startlingly
distinct on the quiet air. That, so far as could be judged, came
from near the spot whither was sent the first signal.</p>

<p>The Sauk and Shawanoe waited further, but nothing was heard that
threw the least light on the plans or doings of the warriors with
whom Deerfoot had had such a sharp brush.</p>

<p>"My brother has learned naught of the pale face?" remarked the
Shawanoe, inquiringly, when his companion had related the experience
through which he passed, after their separation during the afternoon.</p>

<p>"The lips of the Pawnees are shut to the Sauk," replied Hay-uta,
alluding to the tongue of the red men, which was unintelligible
to him.</p>

<p>"Their lips are shut to Deerfoot, but Lone Bear speaks the words
which Deerfoot can understand."</p>

<p>"What were his words to my brother!" asked Hay-uta.</p>

<p>"He says he and Red Wolf have never looked upon the pale face."</p>

<p>"Lone Bear and Red Wolf speak lies!" exclaimed the Sauk with
more feeling than would be expected. "What does Deerfoot think?"
he asked, as if his opinion was a matter of vital importance.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot believes the word of Hay-uta; he told Lone Bear, while
looking in his eyes, that his tongue was double and his heart
was full of lies; Lone Bear rushed upon Deerfoot and sought to
slay him for his words."</p>

<p>This reply was gratifying to Hay-uta, who held the young Shawanoe
that had vanquished him with such brilliancy, in higher esteem
than any one else in the world. He was silent, as if unable to
express his feelings, and the Shawanoe continued:</p>

<p>"Hay-uta has talked with the Great Spirit; he has listened to
the words of the kind Father who looks down from the moon behind
the clouds; the whisperings of the Great Spirit have been sweet
in his ears; Hay-uta could not speak with a double tongue, when
he thinks of his goodness."</p>

<p>As the Sauk replied, he looked upward at the sky. The ragged
cloud which a moment before was passing across the face of the
moon, glided off, and the soft light shone full upon the coppery
countenance that glowed with a feeling, such as only a close communion
with God stirs in the recesses of the heart.</p>

<p>"Hay-uta has heard the voice of the Great Spirit," said the Sauk,
speaking in low tones, "but his words were whispers and Hay-uta
did not hear them all, and sometimes he could not hear aright."</p>

<p>This confession that the mists had not cleared from before the
Sauk's vision did not surprise Deerfoot, for his own gropings
after light were too distinct for him ever to forget the winding
path over which he trod.</p>

<p>"The Great Spirit never sleeps," replied Deerfoot, in a voice
almost as low as his companion's; "he listens for the words of
his children and his ear is always open; he will hear Hay-uta,
if he calls upon him and speaks and acts so that when the Great
Spirit looks down he will smile."</p>

<p>"Hay-uta will talk with the Great Spirit, so that the whispers
which he now hears shall become so loud that Hay-uta can not mistake
them."</p>

<p>Deerfoot added a few words of encouragement, and then, having
paused long enough on the shore, they addressed themselves to
the duty before them.</p>

<p>This was simply to cross to the other side, so as to rejoin Jack
Carleton. As there was but the one means of passing over, it was
idle to hesitate. The Shawanoe stepped carefully a few paces,
when the water reached his armpits, and he began swimming. He
did so, holding his bow above the surface with one hand, so as
to protect the string from moisture. This was one of the disadvantages
of that weapon, though the rifle was not free from a similar inconvenience;
but Hay-uta fastened it to his back, so that the muzzle projected
above his head and the water could not run into the barrel. Sometimes
he used a cork-like piece of wood to keep the load from wetting,
and again he took no precautions, but drew the charge after leaving
the stream. Even with all the care that could be taken, the clumsy
hammer and flint let down in the pan often failed to protect the
powder.</p>

<p>But both were splendid swimmers, and, though the current was
powerful, they advanced with steady, even strokes until their
feet touched bottom, when they walked out on the opposite side.
There the shore was similar to the one just left, so that when
their moccasins pressed dry land again, they stood in the shadow
of the overhanging trees, millions of which, at that day, covered
the vast western wilderness.</p>

<p>Their course had been such that (supposing Jack Carleton remained
near the spot where the parting took place), it was now necessary
to make their way for some distance up the stream. As there was
reason to believe that the broad, swift current interposed between
them and the hostiles, Deerfoot and Hay-uta looked back at the
land just left behind.</p>

<p>The view was so similar to what has already been described, that
no more words are needed. The clouds were still floating in front
of the moon, and quaint shadows moved across the river, forest
and openings, but the searching vision failed to show the twinkle
of any camp-fire, nor could the keen eyes of the Shawanoe catch
the faintest glimpse of any shadowy figures stealing along shore.</p>

<p>Though it was the mild season, the night was quite cool, and
it will be remembered that neither carried his blanket with him.
Most persons would have shivered with discomfort, but the American
Indian is educated to the severest exposure and inured to sudden
changes of temperature. It would have been more pleasant had they
been arrayed in dry clothing rather than in their clinging garments,
yet neither acted as if he cared for the difference.</p>

<p>They were moving along the river bank in their usual guarded
manner, when both came to an abrupt stop; they had caught the
twinkle of a camp-fire among the trees just ahead.</p>
