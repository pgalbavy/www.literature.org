The Tin Owl gave a hoot of delight when he saw the Red
Wagon draw up before Jinjur's house, and the Brown Bear
grunted and growled with glee and trotted toward Ozma
as fast as he could wobble. As for the Canary, it flew
swiftly to Dorothy's shoulder and perched there, saying
in her ear:
<P>
"Thank goodness you have come to our rescue!"
<P>
"But who are you?" asked Dorothy
<P>
"Don't you know?" returned the Canary.
<P>
"No; for the first time we noticed you in the Magic
Picture, you were just a bird, as you are now. But
we've guessed that the giant woman had transformed you,
as she did the others."
<P>
"Yes; I'm Polychrome, the Rainbow's Daughter,"
announced the Canary.
<P>
"Goodness me!" cried Dorothy. "How dreadful."
<P>
"Well, I make a rather pretty bird, I think,"
returned Polychrome, "but of course I'm anxious to
resume my own shape and get back upon my rainbow."
<P>
"Ozma will help you, I'm sure," said Dorothy. "How
does it feel, Scarecrow, to be a Bear?" she asked,
addressing her old friend.
<P>
"I don't like it," declared the Scarecrow Bear. "This
brutal form is quite beneath the dignity of a wholesome
straw man."
<P>
"And think of me," said the Owl, perching upon the
dashboard of the Red Wagon with much noisy clattering
of his tin feathers. "Don't I look horrid, Dorothy,
with eyes several sizes too big for my body, and so
weak that I ought to wear spectacles?"
<P>
"Well," said Dorothy critically, as she looked him
over, "you're nothing to brag of, I must confess. But
Ozma will soon fix you up again."
<P>
The Green Monkey had hung back, bashful at meeting
two lovely girls while in the form of a beast; but
Jinjur now took his hand and led him forward while she
introduced him to Ozma, and Woot managed to make a low
bow, not really ungraceful, before her girlish Majesty,
the Ruler of Oz.
<P>
"You have all been forced to endure a sad
experience," said Ozma, "and so I am anxious to do all
in my power to break Mrs. Yoop's enchantments. But
first tell me how you happened to stray into that
lonely Valley where Yoop Castle stands."
<P>
Between them they related the object of their
journey, the Scarecrow Bear telling of the Tin
Woodman's resolve to find Nimmie Amee and marry her, as
a just reward for her loyalty to him. Woot told of
their adventures with the Loons of Loonville, and the
Tin Owl described the manner in which they had been
captured and transformed by the Giantess. Then
Polychrome related her story, and when all had been
told, and Dorothy had several times reproved Toto for
growling at the Tin Owl, Ozma remained thoughtful for a
while, pondering upon what she had heard. Finally she
looked up, and with one of her delightful smiles, said
to the anxious group:
<P>
"I am not sure my magic will be able to restore
every one of you, because your transformations are
of such a strange and unusual character. Indeed,
Mrs. Yoop was quite justified in believing no power
could alter her enchantments. However, I am sure
I can restore the Scarecrow to his original shape.
He was stuffed with straw from the beginning, and
even the yookoohoo magic could not alter that. The
Giantess was merely able to make a bear's shape of
a man's shape, but the bear is stuffed with straw,
just as the man was. So I feel confident I can make
a man of the bear again."
<P>
"Hurrah!" cried the Brown Bear, and tried clumsily to
dance a jig of delight.
<P>
"As for the Tin Woodman, his case is much the same,"
resumed Ozma, still smiling. "The power of the Giantess
could not make him anything but a tin creature,
whatever shape she transformed him into, so it will not
be impossible to restore him to his manly form. Anyhow,
I shall test my magic at once, and see if it will do
what I have promised."
<P>
She drew from her bosom a small silver Wand and,
making passes with the Wand over the head of the Bear,
she succeeded in the brief space of a moment in
breaking his enchantment. The original Scarecrow of Oz
again stood before them, well stuffed with straw and
with his features nicely painted upon the bag which
formed his head.
<P>
The Scarecrow was greatly delighted, as you may
suppose, and he strutted proudly around while the
powerful fairy, Ozma of Oz, broke the enchantment that
had transformed the Tin Woodman and made a Tin Owl into
a Tin Man again.
<P>
"Now, then," chirped the Canary, eagerly; "I'm
next, Ozma!"
<P>
"But your case is different," replied Ozma, no
longer smiling but wearing a grave expression on
her sweet face. "I shall have to experiment on you,
Polychrome, and I may fail in all my attempts."
<P>
She then tried two or three different methods of
magic, hoping one of them would succeed in breaking
Polychrome's enchantment, but still the Rainbow's
Daughter remained a Canary-Bird. Finally, however, she
experimented in another way. She transformed the Canary
into a Dove, and then transformed the Dove into a
Speckled Hen, and then changed the Speckled Hen into a
rabbit, and then the rabbit into a Fawn. And at the
last, after mixing several powders and sprinkling them
upon the Fawn, the yookoohoo enchantment was suddenly
broken and before them stood one of the daintiest and
loveliest creatures in any fairyland in the world.
Polychrome was as sweet and merry in disposition as she
was beautiful, and when she danced and capered around
in delight, her beautiful hair floated around her like
a golden mist and her many-hued raiment, as soft as
cobwebs, reminded one of drifting clouds in a summer
sky.
<P>
Woot was so awed by the entrancing sight of this
exquisite Sky Fairy that he quite forgot his own sad
plight until be noticed Ozma gazing upon him with an
intent expression that denoted sympathy and sorrow.
Dorothy whispered in her friend's ear, but the Ruler of
Oz shook her head sadly.
<P>
Jinjur, noticing this and understanding Ozma's looks,
took the paw of the Green Monkey in her own hand and
patted it softly.
<P>
"Never mind," she said to him. "You are a very
beautiful color, and a monkey can climb better than a
boy and do a lot of other things no boy can ever do."
<P>
"What's the matter?" asked Woot, a sinking feeling at
his heart. "Is Ozma's magic all used up?"
<P>
Ozma herself answered him.
<P>
"Your form of enchantment, my poor boy," she said
pityingly, "is different from that of the others.
Indeed, it is a form that is impossible to alter by any
magic known to fairies or yookoohoos. The wicked
Giantess was well aware, when she gave you the form of
a Green Monkey, that the Green Monkey must exist in the
Land of Oz for all future time."
<P>
Woot drew a long sigh.
<P>
"Well, that's pretty hard luck," he said bravely,
"but if it can't be helped I must endure it; that's
all. I don't like being a monkey, but what's the use of
kicking against my fate?"
<P>
They were all very sorry for him, and Dorothy
anxiously asked Ozma:
<P>
"Couldn't Glinda save him?"
<P>
"No," was the reply. "Glinda's power in trans-
formations is no greater than my own. Before I left my
palace I went to my Magic Room and studied Woot's case
very carefully. I found that no power can do away with
the Green Monkey. He might transfer, or exchange his
form with some other person, it is true; but the Green
Monkey we cannot get rid of by any magic arts known to
science."
<P>
"But -- see here," said the Scarecrow, who had
listened intently to this explanation, "why not put the
monkey's form on some one else?"
<P>
"Who would agree to make the change?" asked Ozma. "If
by force we caused anyone else to become a Green
Monkey, we would be as cruel and wicked as Mrs. Yoop.
And what good would an exchange do?" she continued.
"Suppose, for instance, we worked the enchantment, and
made Toto into a Green Monkey. At the same moment Woot
would become a little dog."
<P>
"Leave me out of your magic, please," said Toto, with
a reproachful growl. "I wouldn't become a Green Monkey
for anything."
<P>
"And I wouldn't become a dog," said Woot. "A green
monkey is much better than a dog, it seems to me."
<P>
"That is only a matter of opinion," answered Toto.
<P>
"Now, here's another idea," said the Scarecrow. "My
brains are working finely today, you must admit. Why
not transform Toto into Woot the Wanderer, and then
have them exchange forms? The dog would become a green
monkey and the monkey would have his own natural shape
again."
<P>
"To be sure!" cried Jinjur. "That's a fine idea."
<P>
"Leave me out of it," said Toto. "I won't do it."
<P>
"Wouldn't you be willing to become a green monkey --
see what a pretty color it is -- so that this poor boy
could be restored to his own shape?" asked Jinjur,
pleadingly
<P>
"No," said Toto.
<P>
"I don't like that plan the least bit," declared
Dorothy, "for then I wouldn't have any little dog."
<P>
"But you'd have a green monkey in his place,"
persisted Jinjur, who liked Woot and wanted to help
him.
<P>
"I don't want a green monkey," said Dorothy
positively.
<P>
"Don't speak of this again, I beg of you," said Woot.
"This is my own misfortune and I would rather suffer it
alone than deprive Princess Dorothy of her dog, or
deprive the dog of his proper shape. And perhaps even
her Majesty, Ozma of Oz, might not be able to transform
anyone else into the shape of Woot the Wanderer."
<P>
"Yes; I believe I might do that," Ozma returned; "but
Woot is quite right; we are not justified in inflicting
upon anyone -- man or dog -- the form of a green
monkey. Also it is certain that in order to relieve the
boy of the form he now wears, we must give it to
someone else, who would be forced to wear it always."
<P>
"I wonder," said Dorothy, thoughtfully, "if we
couldn't find someone in the Land of Oz who would be
willing to become a green monkey? Seems to me a monkey
is active and spry, and he can climb trees and do a lot
of clever things, and green isn't a bad color for a
monkey -- it makes him unusual."
<P>
"I wouldn't ask anyone to take this dreadful form,"
said Woot; "it wouldn't be right, you know. I've been a
monkey for some time, now, and I don't like it. It
makes me ashamed to be a beast of this sort when by
right of birth I'm a boy; so I'm sure it would be
wicked to ask anyone else to take my place."
<P>
They were all silent, for they knew he spoke the
truth. Dorothy was almost ready to cry with pity and
Ozma's sweet face was sad and disturbed. The Scarecrow
rubbed and patted his stuffed head to try to make it
think better, while the Tin Woodman went into the house
and began to oil his tin joints so that the sorrow of
his friends might not cause him to weep. Weeping is
liable to rust tin, and the Emperor prided himself upon
his highly polished body -- now doubly dear to him
because for a time he had been deprived of it.
<P>
Polychrome had danced down the garden paths and back
again a dozen times, for she was seldom still a moment,
yet she had heard Ozma's speech and understood very
well Woot's unfortunate position. But the Rainbow's
Daughter, even while dancing, could think and reason
very clearly, and suddenly she solved the problem in
the nicest possible way. Coming close to Ozma, she
said:
<P>
"Your Majesty, all this trouble was caused by the
wickedness of Mrs. Yoop, the Giantess. Yet even now
that cruel woman is living in her secluded castle,
enjoying the thought that she has put this terrible
enchantment on Woot the Wanderer. Even now she is
laughing at our despair because we can find no way to
get rid of the green monkey. Very well, we do not wish
to get rid of it. Let the woman who created the form
wear it herself, as a just punishment for her
wickedness. I am sure your fairy power can give to Mrs.
Yoop the form of Woot the Wanderer -- even at this
distance from her --and then it will be possible to
exchange the two forms. Mrs. Yoop will become the Green
Monkey, and Woot will recover his own form again."
<P>
Ozma's face brightened as she listened to this clever
proposal.
<P>
"Thank you, Polychrome," said she. "The task you
propose Is not so easy as you suppose, but I will make
the attempt, and perhaps I may succeed."
