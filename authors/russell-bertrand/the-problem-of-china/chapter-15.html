<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>In this chapter I propose to take, as far as I am able, the standpoint
of a progressive and public-spirited Chinese, and consider what
reforms, in what order, I should advocate in that case.</p>

<p>To begin with, it is clear that China must be saved by her own
efforts, and cannot rely upon outside help. In the international
situation, China has had both good and bad fortune. The Great
War was unfortunate, because it gave Japan temporarily a free
hand; the collapse of Tsarist Russia was fortunate, because it
put an end to the secret alliance of Russians and Japanese; the
Anglo-Japanese Alliance was unfortunate, because it compelled
us to abet Japanese aggression even against our own economic interests;
the friction between Japan and America was fortunate; but the
agreement arrived at by the Washington Conference, though momentarily
advantageous as regards Shantung, is likely, in the long run,
to prove unfortunate, since it will make America less willing
to oppose Japan. For reasons which I set forth in Chap. X., unless
China becomes strong, either the collapse of Japan or her unquestioned
ascendency in the Far East is almost certain to prove disastrous
to China; and one or other of these is very likely to come about.
All the Great Powers, without exception, have interests which
are incompatible, in the long run, with China's welfare and with
the best development of Chinese civilization. Therefore the Chinese
must seek salvation in their own energy, not in the benevolence
of any outside Power.</p>

<p>The problem is not merely one of <em>political</em> independence;
a certain cultural independence is at least as important. I have
tried to show in this book that the Chinese are, in certain ways,
superior to us, and it would not be good either for them or for
us if, in these ways, they had to descend to our level in order
to preserve their existence as a nation. In this matter, however,
a compromise is necessary. Unless they adopt some of our vices
to some extent, we shall not respect them, and they will be increasingly
oppressed by foreign nations. The object must be to keep this
process within the narrowest limits compatible with safety.</p>

<p>First of all, a patriotic spirit is necessary&mdash;not, of course,
the bigoted anti-foreign spirit of the Boxers, but the enlightened
attitude which is willing to learn from other nations while not
willing to allow them to dominate. This attitude has been generated
among educated Chinese, and to a great extent in the merchant
class, by the brutal tuition of Japan. The danger of patriotism
is that, as soon as it has proved strong enough for successful
defence, it is apt to turn to foreign aggression. China, by her
resources and her population, is capable of being the greatest
Power in the world after the United States. It is much to be feared
that, in the process of becoming strong enough to preserve their
independence, the Chinese may become strong enough to embark upon
a career of imperialism. It cannot be too strongly urged that
patriotism should be only defensive, not aggressive. But with
this proviso, I think a spirit of patriotism is absolutely necessary
to the regeneration of China. Independence is to be sought, not
as an end in itself, but as a means towards a new blend of Western
skill with the traditional Chinese virtues. If this end is not
achieved, political independence will have little value.</p>

<p>The three chief requisites, I should say, are: (1) The establishment
of an orderly Government; (2) industrial development under Chinese
control; (3) The spread of education. All these aims will have
to be pursued concurrently, but on the whole their urgency seems
to me to come in the above order. We have already seen how large
a part the State will have to take in building up industry, and
how impossible this is while the political anarchy continues.
Funds for education on a large scale are also unobtainable until
there is good government. Therefore good government is the prerequisite
of all other reforms. Industrialism and education are closely
connected, and it would be difficult to decide the priority between
them; but I have put industrialism first, because, unless it is
developed very soon by the Chinese, foreigners will have acquired
such a strong hold that it will be very difficult indeed to oust
them. These reasons have decided me that our three problems ought
to be taken in the above order.</p>

<p>1. <em>The establishment of an orderly government</em>. &mdash;At
the moment of writing, the condition of China is as anarchic as
it has ever been. A battle between Chang-tso-lin and Wu-Pei-Fu
is imminent; the former is usually considered, though falsely
according to some good authorities, the most reactionary force
in China; Wu-Pei-Fu, though <em>The Times</em> calls him "the
Liberal leader," may well prove no more satisfactory than "Liberal"
leaders nearer home. It is of course possible that, if he wins,
he may be true to his promises and convoke a Parliament for all
China; but it is at least equally possible that he may not. In
any case, to depend upon the favour of a successful general is
as precarious as to depend upon the benevolence of a foreign Power.
If the progressive elements are to win, they must become a strong
organized force.</p>

<p>So far as I can discover, Chinese Constitutionalists are doing
the best thing that is possible at the moment, namely, concerting
a joint programme, involving the convoking of a Parliament and
the cessation of military usurpation. Union is essential, even
if it involves sacrifice of cherished beliefs on the part of some.
Given a programme upon which all the Constitutionalists are united,
they will acquire great weight in public opinion, which is very
powerful in China. They may then be able, sooner or later, to
offer a high constitutional position to some powerful general,
on condition of his ceasing to depend upon mere military force.
By this means they may be able to turn the scales in favour of
the man they select, as the student agitation turned the scales
in July 1920 in favour of Wu-Pei-Fu against the An Fu party. Such
a policy can only be successful if it is combined with vigorous
propaganda, both among the civilian population and among the soldiers,
and if, as soon as peace is restored, work is found for disbanded
soldiers and pay for those who are not disbanded. This raises
the financial problem, which is very difficult, because foreign
Powers will not lend except in return for some further sacrifice
of the remnants of Chinese independence. (For reasons explained
in Chap. X., I do not accept the statement by the American consortium
bankers that a loan from them would not involve control over China's
internal affairs. They may not mean control to be involved, but
I am convinced that in fact it would be.) The only way out of
this difficulty that I can see is to raise an internal loan by
appealing to the patriotism of Chinese merchants. There is plenty
of money in China, but, very naturally, rich Chinese will not
lend to any of the brigands who now control the Government.</p>

<p>When the time comes to draft a permanent Constitution, I have
no doubt that it will have to be federal, allowing a very large
measure of autonomy to the provinces, and reserving for the Central
Government few things except customs, army and navy, foreign relations
and railways. Provincial feeling is strong, and it is now, I think,
generally recognized that a mistake was made in 1912 in not allowing
it more scope.</p>

<p>While a Constitution is being drafted, and even after it has
been agreed upon, it will not be possible to rely upon the inherent
prestige of Constitutionalism, or to leave public opinion without
guidance. It will be necessary for the genuinely progressive people
throughout the country to unite in a strongly disciplined society,
arriving at collective decisions and enforcing support of those
decisions upon all its members. This society will have to win
the confidence of public opinion by a very rigid avoidance of
corruption and political profiteering; the slightest failure of
a member in this respect must be visited by expulsion. The society
must make itself obviously the champion of the national interests
as against all self-seekers, speculators and toadies to foreign
Powers. It will thus become able authoritatively to commend or
condemn politicians and to wield great influence over opinion,
even in the army. There exists in Young China enough energy, patriotism
and honesty to create such a society and to make it strong through
the respect which it will command. But unless enlightened patriotism
is organized in some such way, its power will not be equal to
the political problems with which China is faced.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, the encroachments of foreign Powers upon the
sovereign rights of China must be swept away. The Chinese must
recover the Treaty Ports, control of the tariff, and so on; they
must also free themselves from extra-territoriality. But all this
can probably be done, as it was in Japan, without offending foreign
Powers (except perhaps the Japanese). It would be a mistake to
complicate the early stages of Chinese recovery by measures which
would antagonize foreign Powers in general. Russia was in a stronger
position for defence than China, yet Russia has suffered terribly
from the universal hostility provoked by the Bolsheviks. Given
good government and a development of China's resources, it will
be possible to obtain most of the needed concessions by purely
diplomatic means; the rest can wait for a suitable opportunity.</p>

<p>2. <em>Industrial development.</em> &mdash;On this subject I
have already written in Chap. <em>XIV.; </em>it is certain general
aspects of the subject that I wish to consider now. For reasons
already given, I hold that all railways ought to be in the hands
of the State, and that all successful mines ought to be purchased
by the State at a fair valuation, even if they are not State-owned
from the first. Contracts with foreigners for loans ought to be
carefully drawn so as to leave the control to China. There would
not be much difficulty about this if China had a stable and orderly
government; in that case, many foreign capitalists would be willing
to lend on good security, without exacting any part in the management.
Every possible diplomatic method should be employed to break down
such a monopoly as the consortium seeks to acquire in the matter
of loans.</p>

<p>Given good government, a large amount of State enterprise would
be desirable in Chinese industry. There are many arguments for
State Socialism, or rather what Lenin calls State Capitalism,
in any country which is economically but not culturally backward.
In the first place, it is easier for the State to borrow than
for a private person; in the second place, it is easier for the
State to engage and employ the foreign experts who are likely
to be needed for some time to come; in the third place, it is
easier for the State to make sure that vital industries do not
come under the control of foreign Powers. What is perhaps more
important than any of these considerations is that, by undertaking
industrial enterprise from the first, the State can prevent the
growth of many of the evils of private capitalism. If China can
acquire a vigorous and honest State, it will be possible to develop
Chinese industry without, at the same time, developing the overweening
power of private capitalists by which the Western nations are
now both oppressed and misled.</p>

<p>But if this is to be done successfully, it will require a great
change in Chinese morals, a development of public spirit in place
of the family ethic, a transference to the public service of that
honesty which already exists in private business, and a degree
of energy which is at present rare. I believe that Young China
is capable of fulfilling these requisites, spurred on by patriotism;
but it is important to realize that they are requisites, and that,
without them, any system of State Socialism must fail.</p>

<p>For industrial development, it is important that the Chinese
should learn to become technical experts and also to become skilled
workers. I think more has been done towards the former of these
needs than towards the latter. For the latter purpose, it would
probably be wise to import skilled workmen&mdash;say from Germany&mdash;and
cause them to give instruction to Chinese workmen in any new branch
of industrial work that it might be desired to develop.</p>

<p>3. <em>Education.</em> &mdash;If China is to become a democracy,
as most progressive Chinese hope, universal education is imperative.
Where the bulk of the population cannot read, true democracy is
impossible. Education is a good in itself, but is also essential
for developing political consciousness, of which at present there
is almost none in rural China. The Chinese themselves are well
aware of this, but in the present state of the finances it is
impossible to establish universal elementary education. Until
it has been established for some time, China must be, in fact,
if not in form, an oligarchy, because the uneducated masses cannot
have any effective political opinion. Even given good government,
it is doubtful whether the immense expense of educating such a
vast population could be borne by the nation without a considerable
industrial development. Such industrial development as already
exists is mainly in the hands of foreigners, and its profits provide
warships for the Japanese, or mansions and dinners for British
and American millionaires. If its profits are to provide the funds
for Chinese education, industry must be in Chinese hands. This
is another reason why industrial development must probably precede
any complete scheme of education.</p>

<p>For the present, even if the funds existed, there would not be
sufficient teachers to provide a schoolmaster in every village.
There is, however, such an enthusiasm for education in China that
teachers are being trained as fast as is possible with such limited
resources; indeed a great deal of devotion and public spirit is
being shown by Chinese educators, whose salaries are usually many
months in arrears.</p>

<p>Chinese control is, to my mind, as important in the matter of
education as in the matter of industry. For the present, it is
still necessary to have foreign instructors in some subjects,
though this necessity will soon cease. Foreign instructors, however,
provided they are not too numerous, do no harm, any more than
foreign experts in railways and mines. What does harm is foreign
management. Chinese educated in mission schools, or in lay establishments
controlled by foreigners, tend to become de-nationalized, and
to have a slavish attitude towards Western civilization. This
unfits them for taking a useful part in the national life, and
tends to undermine their morals. Also, oddly enough, it makes
them more conservative in purely Chinese matters than the young
men and women who have had a modern education under Chinese auspices.
Europeans in general are more conservative about China than the
modern Chinese are, and they tend to convey their conservatism
to their pupils. And of course their whole influence, unavoidably
if involuntarily, militates against national self-respect in those
whom they teach.</p>

<p>Those who desire to do research in some academic subject will,
for some time to come, need a period of residence in some European
or American university. But for the great majority of university
students it is far better, if possible, to acquire their education
in China. Returned students have, to a remarkable extent, the
stamp of the country from which they have returned, particularly
when that country is America. A society such as was foreshadowed
earlier in this chapter, in which all really progressive Chinese
should combine, would encounter difficulties, as things stand,
from the divergencies in national bias between students returned
from (say) Japan, America and Germany. Given time, this difficulty
can be overcome by the increase in purely Chinese university education,
but at present the difficulty would be serious.</p>

<p>To overcome this difficulty, two things are needed: inspiring
leadership, and a clear conception of the kind of civilization
to be aimed at. Leadership will have to be both intellectual and
practical. As regards intellectual leadership, China is a country
where writers have enormous influence, and a vigorous reformer
possessed of literary skill could carry with him the great majority
of Young China. Men with the requisite gifts exist in China; I
might mention, as an example personally known to me, Dr. Hu Suh.[110]
He has great learning, wide culture, remarkable energy, and a
fearless passion for reform; his writings in the vernacular inspire
enthusiasm among progressive Chinese. He is in favour of assimilating
all that is good in Western culture, but by no means a slavish
admirer of our ways.</p>

<p>The practical political leadership of such a society as I conceive
to be needed would probably demand different gifts from those
required in an intellectual leader. It is therefore likely that
the two could not be combined in one man, but would need men as
different as Lenin and Karl Marx.</p>

<p>The aim to be pursued is of importance, not only to China, but
to the world. Out of the renaissance spirit now existing in China,
it is possible, if foreign nations can be prevented from working
havoc, to develop a new civilization better than any that the
world has yet known. This is the aim which Young China should
set before itself: the preservation of the urbanity and courtesy,
the candour and the pacific temper, which are characteristic of
the Chinese nation, together with a knowledge of Western science
and an application of it to the practical problems of China. Of
such practical problems there are two kinds: one due to the internal
condition of China, and the other to its international situation.
In the former class come education, democracy, the diminution
of poverty, hygiene and sanitation, and the prevention of famines.
In the latter class come the establishment of a strong government,
the development of industrialism, the revision of treaties and
the recovery of the Treaty Ports (as to which Japan may serve
as a model), and finally, the creation of an army sufficiently
strong to defend the country against Japan. Both classes of problems
demand Western science. But they do not demand the adoption of
the Western philosophy of life.</p>

<p>If the Chinese were to adopt the Western philosophy of life,
they would, as soon as they had made themselves safe against foreign
aggression, embark upon aggression on their own account. They
would repeat the campaigns of the Han and Tang dynasties in Central
Asia, and perhaps emulate Kublai by the invasion of Japan. They
would exploit their material resources with a view to producing
a few bloated plutocrats at home and millions dying of hunger
abroad. Such are the results which the West achieves by the application
of science. If China were led astray by the lure of brutal power,
she might repel her enemies outwardly, but would have yielded
to them inwardly. It is not unlikely that the great military nations
of the modern world will bring about their own destruction by
their inability to abstain from war, which will become, with every
year that passes, more scientific and more devastating. If China
joins in this madness, China will perish like the rest. But if
Chinese reformers can have the moderation to stop when they have
made China capable of self-defence, and to abstain from the further
step of foreign conquest; if, when they have become safe at home,
they can turn aside from the materialistic activities imposed
by the Powers, and devote their freedom to science and art and
the inauguration of a better economic system&mdash;then China will
have played the part in the world for which she is fitted, and
will have given to mankind as a whole new hope in the moment of
greatest need. It is this hope that I wish to see inspiring Young
China. This hope is realizable; and because it is realizable,
China deserves a foremost place in the esteem of every lover of
mankind.</p>

<p><em>FOOTNOTES</em>:</p>

<p>[Footnote 110: An account of a portion of his work will be found
in Tyau, op. cit. pp. 40 ff.]</p>

<p><em>APPENDIX</em></p>

<p>While the above pages were going through the Press, some important
developments have taken place in China. Wu-Pei-Fu has defeated
Chang-tso-lin and made himself master of Peking. Chang has retreated
towards Manchuria with a broken army, and proclaimed the independence
of Manchuria. This might suit the Japanese very well, but it is
hardly to be supposed that the other Powers would acquiesce. It
is, therefore, not unlikely that Chang may lose Manchuria also,
and cease to be a factor in Chinese politics.</p>

<p>For the moment, Wu-Pei-Fu controls the greater part of China,
and his intentions become important. The British in China have,
for some years, befriended him, and this fact colours all Press
telegrams appearing in our newspapers. According to <em>The Times</em>,
he has pronounced in favour of the reassembling of the old all-China
Parliament, with a view to the restoration of constitutional government.
This is a measure in which the South could concur, and if he really
adheres to this intention he has it in his power to put an end
to Chinese anarchy. <em>The Times</em> Peking correspondent, telegraphing
on May 30, reports that "Wu-Pei-Fu declares that if the old Parliament
will reassemble and work in national interests he will support
it up to the limit, and fight any obstructionists."</p>

<p>On May 18, the same correspondent telegraphed that "Wu-Pei-Fu
is lending his support to the unification movements, and has found
common ground for action with Chen Chiung Ming," who is Sun's
colleague at Canton and is engaged in civil war with Sun, who
is imperialistic and wants to conquer all China for his government,
said to be alone constitutional. The programme agreed upon between
Wu and Chen Chiung Ming is given in the same telegram as follows:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Local self-government shall be established and magistrates shall<br/>
be elected by the people; District police shall be created under<br/>
District Boards subject to Central Provincial Boards; Civil<br/>
governors shall be responsible to the Central Government, not to<br/>
the Tuchuns; a national army shall be created, controlled and<br/>
paid by the Central Government; Provincial police and<br/>
<em>gendarmerie</em>, not the Tuchuns or the army, shall be responsible<br/>
for peace and order in the provinces; the whole nation shall<br/>
agree to recall the old Parliament and the restoration of the<br/>
Provisional Constitution of the first year of the Republic; Taxes<br/>
shall be collected by the Central Government, and only a<br/>
stipulated sum shall be granted to each province for expenses,<br/>
the balance to be forwarded to the Central Government as under<br/>
the Ching dynasty; Afforestation shall be undertaken, industries<br/>
established, highways built, and other measures taken to keep the<br/>
people on the land.

</p>
</div>
<p>This is an admirable programme, but it is impossible to know
how much of it will ever be carried out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sun Yat Sen is still at war with Wu-Pei-Fu. It has
been stated in the British Press that there was an alliance between
Sun and Chang, but it seems there was little more than a common
hostility to Wu. Sun's friends maintain that he is a genuine Constitutionalist,
and that Wu is not to be trusted, but Chen Chiung Ming has a better
reputation than Sun among reformers. The British in China all
praise Wu and hate Sun; the Americans all praise Sun and decry
Wu. Sun undoubtedly has a past record of genuine patriotism, and
there can be no doubt that the Canton Government has been the
best in China. What appears in our newspapers on the subject is
certainly designed to give a falsely unfavourable impression of
Canton. For example, in <em>The Times</em> of May 15, a telegram
appeared from Hong-Kong to the following effect:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
I learn that the troops of Sun Yat Sen, President of South China,<br/>
which are stated to be marching north from Canton, are a rabble.<br/>
Many are without weapons and a large percentage of the uniforms<br/>
are merely rags. There is no discipline, and gambling and<br/>
opium-smoking are rife.

</p>
</div>
<p>Nevertheless, on May 30, <em>The Times</em> had to confess that
this army had won a brilliant victory, capturing "the most important
stronghold in Kiangsi," together with 40 field guns and large
quantities of munitions.</p>

<p>The situation must remain obscure until more detailed news has
arrived by mail. It is to be hoped that the Canton Government,
through the victory of Chen Chiung Ming, will come to terms with
Wu-Pei-Fu, and will be strong enough to compel him to adhere to
the terms. It is to be hoped also that Chang's proclamation of
the independence of Manchuria will not be seized upon by Japan
as an excuse for a more complete absorption of that country. If
Wu-Pei-Fu adheres to the declaration quoted above, there can be
no patriotic reason why Canton should not co-operate with him;
on the other hand, the military strength of Canton makes it more
likely that Wu will find it prudent to adhere to his declaration.
There is certainly a better chance than there was before the defeat
of Chang for the unification of China and the ending of the Tuchuns'
tyranny. But it is as yet no more than a chance, and the future
is still problematical.</p>
