<p>The gray light of dawn was spreading over the wood and river
when Elwood Brandon again opened his eyes. He was somewhat startled
to see nothing of the Pah Utah, although his canoe was still in
the advance; but a second look showed that they were resting against
the bank, and the Indian lay asleep in the front of his boat,
his body and face covered entirely by his somber-hued blanket.</p>

<p>"No doubt he needs rest, and so I will not wake him!" was Elwood's
thought, as he carefully raised himself to the sitting position.
But he had scarcely moved when the end of Shasta's blanket was
raised, and the boy saw his dark eyes fixed inquiringly upon him.
Satisfied that there was nothing wrong the blanket dropped again
and all was still.</p>

<p>Elwood now looked around. Howard was sleeping soundly, his feet
resting against the shaggy sides of Terror, who was equally oblivious
to the external world. There could be no doubt of Tim's somnolence
for he gave unmistakable evidence of it. The light was just sufficient
to afford a distinct view of the other shore, and in the clear
summer air of the morning it had a cool appearance, very pleasing
and refreshing to the eye.</p>

<p>Elwood, of course, had no knowledge of the distance they had
come during the night; but he believed Shasta had not slept more
than an hour or two, and that as a consequence they were many
miles from their starting point&mdash;far enough at any rate to make
them perfectly easy regarding the troublesome visitors of yesterday.</p>

<p>He noticed the peculiar character of the place in which Shasta
had run the canoe. It was a small indentation covered with overhanging
limbs and shrubbery in such manner that while the whites could
peer out upon the river there was no danger of their being seen
by any passers-by, unless particular suspicion was directed toward
the spot.</p>

<p>Elwood's limbs were so cramped from the forced position in which
he had lain during the night, that he concluded there could be
no harm in stepping ashore to yawn and stretch himself. Of course
he would take good care not to wander away from the boat, as he
had seen the danger of secession in a small party like theirs.
As he was stepping over the canoe he saw Shasta looking at him
so intently that he paused. The Pah Utah nodded, but made a rather
odd gesture, which Elwood took as a caution not to wander away.
He nodded assent and stepped out upon the land. At this juncture
Howard awoke and followed him.</p>

<p>"Shall we try and hunt something for breakfast?" asked Elwood.</p>

<p>"Tim's troubles have proved that it is hardly safe; I think we
had better leave all such matters to Shasta."</p>

<p>This was good advice certainly, and the boys acted upon it. They
walked up and down the banks of the river admiring the beautiful
scenery, but seeing nothing of wild animals. They heard the whirr
of a flock of birds overhead, alarmed by the apparition of two
human beings, but the luxuriant vegetation allowed but a glimpse
of them as they shot away.</p>

<p>While a few rods distant, they heard the discharge of a rifle,
and in no little trepidation they hastened back to their friends.
They were relieved by finding that it had been done by Tim O'Rooney
for the purpose of affording a means of ignition to some sticks
and leaves. He and the Pah Utah were on shore, making as much
preparation for their breakfast as though they had a dozen men
to provide for.</p>

<p>"What does yez think of it?" asked Tim.</p>

<p>"All very well, but where is your breakfast?"</p>

<p>The Irishman jerked his thumb in a very significant manner toward
Shasta.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to eat him," laughed Elwood.</p>

<p>"Git out wid yer nonsense!" retorted Tim. "He and meself have
been talking together, and we've fixed the whole thing."</p>

<p>"What language did you use?"</p>

<p>"This kind of talk."</p>

<p>And the Irishman explained himself by several extravagant but
meaningless gestures.</p>

<p>The fire being nicely burning, Shasta took some white crumbs
from a sort of receptacle in his hunting-shirt, stepped carefully
into the canoe, and then gently dropped them upon the surface
of the water. Our friend watched his movements with interest.</p>

<p>Leaning carefully over the boat, he curved his arm and held his
closed fingers so that they were just within the water, looking
down into the stream all the time with the fixedness of gaze that
characterizes the hawk when about to dart downward after his prey.</p>

<p>Suddenly a flight ripple was heard, and before either of the
three on shore comprehended what he was doing, something flashed
before their gaze, and a plump, glistening fish, fully two pounds
in weight, lay floundering at their feet.</p>

<p>"Capital!" shouted Elwood in his excitement, and he was proceeding
to pay the Pah Utah several highly flavored compliments, when
he raised his hand as a warning for them to remain quiet. Bending
still further over the canoe, he soon thrust his hand beneath,
and with the same lightning-like quickness flung a still larger
fish up the bank. This was continued for some time, until he had
five fine plump-looking fellows all shining and fresh, waiting
for the hungry stomachs.</p>

<p>They had an abundance of food, and its preparation now only remained.
Here Shasta displayed his remarkable culinary skill. With his
keen-edged hunting-knife he slitted the fish, excepting Terror's
portion, which of course was devoured raw, the entire length of
the bodies, and throwing aside the superfluous portion, then skewered
them upon some green prongs in such a manner that they were completely
flat, and the entire internal and external surface exposed.</p>

<p>The fire, which had been burning some time, was now raked down
until several square feet of live red coals lay bare, when one
of the fish was held down within a few inches. As soon as one
side was thoroughly cooked the other was turned under, and after
this same fashion the four were most speedily and thoroughly prepared
for the palate.</p>

<p>"Luxurious!" exclaimed Howard, as he took his prize and buried
his teeth in its flesh. "It is cooked to perfection&mdash;a trifle
of pepper and salt would make this the best dish I ever tasted."</p>

<p>"I never enjoyed a meal more," replied Elwood. "But when I come
to think, the first one I tasted in California was nearly as good
as this."</p>

<p>Tim was too much engaged to take time for conversation. He waited
until he had filled himself to repletion, when he gave a great
sigh of relief and remarked:</p>

<p>"I ain't hungry&mdash;not a bit; I've lost me appetite very quickly.
Mr. Shasta, you're an excellent cook&mdash;worthy of the honor of attending
to the wants of Timothy O'Rooney, Esquire."</p>

<p>The Pah Utah paid no heed to this praise, but contented himself
with devouring his fish, which he did until he had all that he
wished, when from some hidden recess he produced a beautifully
carved Indian pipe.</p>

<p>"There I'm wid yees agin," remarked Tim, as he replenished his
own. "The pipe is very soothin' to one's faalings after sevare
labor, as me brother's wife used to say after whacking a few hours
wid her broomstick&mdash;what is your opinion upon the same, Mr. Shasta?"</p>

<p>The Indian nodded his head and murmured some unintelligible reply.</p>

<p>"Precisely," assented Tim, as he puffed forth a thick volume
of smoke; "that's me own idaas exactly, and the boys here will
bear me witness that I've always contended for the same."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Elwood.</p>

<p>"Ax him," replied Tin, nodding his head toward his dusky friend.
"He's able to explain better nor is meself."</p>
