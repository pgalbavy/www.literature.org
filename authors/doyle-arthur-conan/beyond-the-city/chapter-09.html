Little did poor Doctor Walker imagine as he sat at
his breakfast-table next morning that the two sweet girls
who sat on either side of him were deep in a conspiracy,
and that he, munching innocently at his muffins, was the
victim against whom their wiles were planned.  Patiently
they waited until at last their opening came.
<P>
"It is a beautiful day," he remarked.  "It will do
for Mrs. Westmacott.  She was thinking of having a spin
upon the tricycle."
<P>
"Then we must call early.  We both intended to see
her after breakfast."
<P>
"Oh, indeed!"  The Doctor looked pleased.
<P>
"You know, pa," said Ida, "it seems to us that we
really have a very great advantage in having Mrs.
Westmacott living so near."
<P>
"Why so, dear?"
<P>
"Well, because she is so advanced, you know.  If we
only study her ways we may advance ourselves also."
<P>
"I think I have heard you say, papa," Clara remarked,
"that she is the type of the woman of the future."
<P>
"I am very pleased to hear you speak so sensibly, my
dears.  I certainly think that she is a woman whom you
may very well take as your model.  The more intimate you
are with her the better pleased I shall be."
<P>
"Then that is settled," said Clara demurely, and the
talk drifted to other matters.
<P>
All the morning the two girls sat extracting from
Mrs. Westmacott her most extreme view as to the duty of
the one sex and the tyranny of the other.  Absolute
equality, even in details, was her ideal.  Enough of the
parrot cry of unwomanly and unmaidenly.  It had been
invented by man to scare woman away when she poached too
nearly upon his precious preserves.  Every woman should
be independent.  Every woman should learn a trade.  It
was their duty to push in where they were least
welcome.  Then they were martyrs to the cause, and
pioneers to their weaker sisters.  Why should the
wash-tub, the needle, and the housekeeper's book be
eternally theirs?  Might they not reach higher, to the
consulting-room, to the bench, and even to the pulpit? 
Mrs. Westmacott sacrificed her tricycle ride in her
eagerness over her pet subject, and her two fair
disciples drank in every word, and noted every suggestion
for future use.  That afternoon they went shopping in
London, and before evening strange packages began to be
handed in at the Doctor's door.  The plot was ripe for
execution, and one of the conspirators was merry and
jubilant, while the other was very nervous and troubled.
<P>
When the Doctor came down to the dining-room next
morning, he was surprised to find that his daughters had
already been up some time.  Ida was installed at one end
of the table with a spirit-lamp, a curved glass flask,
and several bottles in front of her.   The contents of
the flask were boiling furiously, while a villainous
smell filled the room.  Clara lounged in an arm-chair
with her feet upon a second one, a blue-covered book in
her hand, and a huge map of the British Islands spread
across her lap.  "Hullo!" cried the Doctor, blinking and
sniffing, "where's the breakfast?"
<P>
"Oh, didn't you order it?" asked Ida.
<P>
"I!  No; why should I?"  He rang the bell.  "Why have
you not laid the breakfast, Jane?"
<P>
"If you please, sir, Miss Ida was a workin' at the
table."
<P>
"Oh, of course, Jane," said the young lady calmly. 
"I am so sorry.  I shall be ready to move in a few
minutes."
<P>
"But what on earth are you doing, Ida?" asked the
Doctor.  "The smell is most offensive.  And, good
gracious, look at the mess which you have made upon the
cloth!  Why, you have burned a hole right through."
<P>
"Oh, that is the acid," Ida answered contentedly. 
"Mrs. Westmacott said that it would burn holes."
<P>
"You might have taken her word for it without
trying," said her father dryly.
<P>
"But look here, pa!  See what the book says:  `The
scientific mind takes nothing upon trust.  Prove all
things!'  I have proved that."
<P>
"You certainly have.  Well, until breakfast is ready
I'll glance over the Times.  Have you seen it?"
<P>
"The Times?  Oh, dear me, this is it which I have
under my spirit-lamp.  I am afraid there is some acid
upon that too, and it is rather damp and torn.  Here it
is."
<P>
The Doctor took the bedraggled paper with a rueful
face.  "Everything seems to be wrong to-day," he
remarked.  "What is this sudden enthusiasm about
chemistry, Ida?"
<P>
"Oh, I am trying to live up to Mrs. Westmacott's
teaching."
<P>
"Quite right! quite right!" said he, though perhaps
with less heartiness than he had shown the day before. 
"Ah, here is breakfast at last!"
<P>
But nothing was comfortable that morning.  There were
eggs without egg-spoons, toast which was leathery from
being kept, dried-up rashers, and grounds in the coffee. 
Above all, there was that dreadful smell which pervaded
everything and gave a horrible twang to every mouthful.
<P>
"I don't wish to put a damper upon your studies,
Ida," said the Doctor, as he pushed back his chair.  "But
I do think it would be better if you did your chemical
experiments a little later in the day."
<P>
"But Mrs. Westmacott says that women should rise
early, and do their work before breakfast."
<P>
"Then they should choose some other room besides the
breakfast-room."  The Doctor was becoming just a little
ruffled.  A turn in the open air would soothe him, he
thought.  "Where are my boots?" he asked.
<P>
But they were not in their accustomed corner by his
chair.  Up and down he searched, while the three servants
took up the quest, stooping and peeping under
book-cases and drawers.  Ida had returned to her studies,
and Clara to her blue-covered volume, sitting absorbed
and disinterested amid the bustle and the racket.  At
last a general buzz of congratulation announced that the
cook had discovered the boots hung up among the hats in
the hall.  The Doctor, very red and flustered, drew them
on, and stamped off to join the Admiral in his morning
walk.
<P>
As the door slammed Ida burst into a shout of
laughter.  "You see, Clara," she cried, "the charm works
already.  He has gone to number one instead of to number
three.  Oh, we shall win a great victory.  You've been
very good, dear; I could see that you were on thorns to
help him when he was looking for his boots."
<P>
"Poor papa!  It is so cruel.  And yet what are we to
do?"
<P>
"Oh, he will enjoy being comfortable all the more if
we give him a little discomfort now.  What horrible
work this chemistry is!  Look at my frock!  It is ruined. 
And this dreadful smell!"  She threw open the window, and
thrust her little golden-curled head out of it.  Charles
Westmacott was hoeing at the other side of the garden
fence.
<P>
"Good morning, sir," said Ida.
<P>
"Good morning!"  The big man leaned upon his hoe and
looked up at her.
<P>
"Have you any cigarettes, Charles?"
<P>
"Yes, certainly."
<P>
"Throw me up two."
<P>
"Here is my case.  Can you catch!"
<P>
A seal-skin case came with a soft thud on to the
floor.  Ida opened it.  It was full.
<P>
"What are these?" she asked.
<P>
"Egyptians."
<P>
"What are some other brands?"
<P>
"Oh, Richmond Gems, and Turkish, and Cambridge.  But
why?"
<P>
"Never mind!"  She nodded to him and closed the
window.  "We must remember all those, Clara," said she. 
"We must learn to talk about such things.  Mrs.
Westmacott knows all about the brands of cigarettes.  Has
your rum come?"
<P>
"Yes, dear.  It is here."
<P>
"And I have my stout.  Come along up to my room now. 
This smell is too abominable.  But we must be ready for
him when he comes back.  If we sit at the window we shall
see him coming down the road."
<P>
The fresh morning air, and the genial company of the
Admiral had caused the Doctor to forget his troubles, and
he came back about midday in an excellent humor.  As he
opened the hall door the vile smell of chemicals which
had spoilt his breakfast met him with a redoubled
virulence.  He threw open the hall window, entered the
dining-room, and stood aghast at the sight which met his
eyes.
<P>
Ida was still sitting among her bottles, with a lit
cigarette in her left hand and a glass of stout on the
table beside her.  Clara, with another cigarette, was
lounging in the easy chair with several maps spread out
upon the floor around.  Her feet were stuck up on the
coal scuttle, and she had a tumblerful of some
reddish-brown composition on the smoking table close at
her elbow.  The Doctor gazed from one to the other of
them through the thin grey haze of smoke, but his eyes
rested finally in a settled stare of astonishment upon
his elder and more serious daughter.
<P>
"Clara!" he gasped, "I could not have believed it!"
<P>
"What is it, papa?"
<P>
"You are smoking!"
<P>
"Trying to, papa.  I find it a little difficult, for
I have not been used to it."
<P>
"But why, in the name of goodness--"
<P>
"Mrs. Westmacott recommends it."
<P>
"Oh, a lady of mature years may do many things which
a young girl must avoid."
<P>
"Oh, no," cried Ida, "Mrs. Westmacott says that there
should be one law for all.  Have a cigarette, pa?"
<P>
"No, thank you.  I never smoke in the morning."
<P>
"No?  Perhaps you don't care for the brand. What
are these, Clara?"
<P>
"Egyptians."
<P>
"Ah, we must have some Richmond Gems or Turkish.  I
wish, pa, when you go into town, you would get me some
Turkish."
<P>
"I will do nothing of the kind.  I do not at all
think that it is a fitting habit for young ladies.  I do
not agree with Mrs. Westmacott upon the point."
<P>
"Really, pa!  It was you who advised us to imitate
her."
<P>
"But with discrimination.  What is it that you are
drinking, Clara?"
<P>
"Rum, papa."
<P>
"Rum?  In the morning?"  He sat down and rubbed his
eyes as one who tries to shake off some evil dream.  "Did
you say rum?"
<P>
"Yes, pa.  They all drink it in the profession which
I am going to take up."
<P>
"Profession, Clara?"
<P>
"Mrs. Westmacott says that every woman should follow
a calling, and that we ought to choose those which women
have always avoided."
<P>
"Quite so."
<P>
"Well, I am going to act upon her advice.  I am going
to be a pilot."
<P>
"My dear Clara!  A pilot!  This is too much."
<P>
"This is a beautiful book, papa.  `The Lights,
Beacons, Buoys, Channels, and Landmarks of Great
Britain.'  Here is another, `The Master Mariner's
Handbook.'  You can't imagine how interesting it is."
<P>
"You are joking, Clara.  You must be joking!"
<P>
"Not at all, pa.  You can't think what a lot I have
learned already.  I'm to carry a green light to starboard
and a red to port, with a white light at the mast-head,
and a flare-up every fifteen minutes."
<P>
"Oh, won't it look pretty at night!" cried her
sister.
<P>
"And I know the fog-signals.  One blast means that a
ship steers to starboard, two to port, three astern, four
that it is unmanageable.  But this man asks such dreadful
questions at the end of each chapter.  Listen to this: 
`You see a red light.  The ship is on the port tack and
the wind at north; what course is that ship steering to
a point?'"
<P>
The Doctor rose with a gesture of despair.  "I can't
imagine what has come over you both," said he.
<P>
"My dear papa, we are trying hard to live up to Mrs.
Westmacott's standard."
<P>
"Well, I must say that I do not admire the result. 
Your chemistry, Ida, may perhaps do no harm; but your
scheme, Clara, is out of the question.  How a girl of
your sense could ever entertain such a notion is more
than I can imagine.  But I must absolutely forbid you to
go further with it."
<P>
"But, pa," asked Ida, with an air of innocent
inquiry in her big blue eyes, "what are we to do when
your commands and Mrs. Westmacott's advice are opposed? 
You told us to obey her.  She says that when women try to
throw off their shackles, their fathers, brothers and
husbands are the very first to try to rivet them on
again, and that in such a matter no man has any
authority."
<P>
"Does Mrs. Westmacott teach you that I am not the
head of my own house?"  The Doctor flushed, and his
grizzled hair bristled in his anger.
<P>
"Certainly.  She says that all heads of houses are
relics of the dark ages."
<P>
The Doctor muttered something and stamped his foot
upon the carpet.  Then without a word he passed out into
the garden and his daughters could see him striding
furiously up and down, cutting off the heads of the
flowers with a switch.
<P>
"Oh, you darling!  You played your part so
splendidly!" cried Ida.
<P>
"But how cruel it is!  When I saw the sorrow and
surprise in his eyes I very nearly put my arms about him
and told him all.  Don't you think we have done enough?"
<P>
"No, no, no.  Not nearly enough.  You must not turn
weak now, Clara.  It is so funny that I should be leading
you.  It is quite a new experience.  But I know I am
right.  If we go an as we are doing, we shall be able
to say all our lives that we have saved him.  And if we
don't, oh, Clara, we should never forgive ourselves."
