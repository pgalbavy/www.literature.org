The two savages, Kaviri and Mugambi, squatting before
the entrance to Kaviri's hut, looked at one another--
Kaviri with ill-concealed alarm.
<P>
"What is it?" he whispered.
<P>
"It is Bwana Tarzan and his people," replied Mugambi.  
"But what they are doing I know not, unless it be that they
are devouring your people who ran away."
<P>
Kaviri shuddered and rolled his eyes fearfully toward the jungle.  
In all his long life in the savage forest he had never
heard such an awful, fearsome din.
<P>
Closer and closer came the sounds, and now with them were
mingled the terrified shrieks of women and children and
of men.  For twenty long minutes the blood-curdling cries
continued, until they seemed but a stone's throw from
the palisade.  Kaviri rose to flee, but Mugambi seized and
held him, for such had been the command of Tarzan.
<P>
A moment later a horde of terrified natives burst from the jungle,
racing toward the shelter of their huts.  Like frightened sheep
they ran, and behind them, driving them as sheep might be driven,
came Tarzan and Sheeta and the hideous apes of Akut.
<P>
Presently Tarzan stood before Kaviri, the old quiet smile upon his lips.
<P>
"Your people have returned, my brother," he said, "and
now you may select those who are to accompany me and
paddle my canoe."
<P>
Tremblingly Kaviri tottered to his feet, calling to his people
to come from their huts; but none responded to his summons.
<P>
"Tell them," suggested Tarzan, "that if they do not come
I shall send my people in after them."
<P>
Kaviri did as he was bid, and in an instant the entire
population of the village came forth, their wide and frightened
eyes rolling from one to another of the savage creatures that
wandered about the village street.
<P>
Quickly Kaviri designated a dozen warriors to accompany Tarzan.  
The poor fellows went almost white with terror at the
prospect of close contact with the panther and the apes in
the narrow confines of the canoes; but when Kaviri explained
to them that there was no escape--that Bwana Tarzan
would pursue them with his grim horde should they attempt
to run away from the duty--they finally went gloomily down
to the river and took their places in the canoe.
<P>
It was with a sigh of relief that their chieftain saw the party
disappear about a headland a short distance up-river.
<P>
For three days the strange company continued farther and
farther into the heart of the savage country that lies on either
side of the almost unexplored Ugambi.  Three of the twelve
warriors deserted during that time; but as several of the apes
had finally learned the secret of the paddles, Tarzan felt no
dismay because of the loss.
<P>
As a matter of fact, he could have travelled much more
rapidly on shore, but he believed that he could hold his own
wild crew together to better advantage by keeping them to
the boat as much as possible.  Twice a day they landed to hunt
and feed, and at night they slept upon the bank of the mainland
or on one of the numerous little islands that dotted the river.
<P>
Before them the natives fled in alarm, so that they found
only deserted villages in their path as they proceeded.  
Tarzan was anxious to get in touch with some of the savages
who dwelt upon the river's banks, but so far he had been unable
to do so.
<P>
Finally he decided to take to the land himself, leaving his
company to follow after him by boat.  He explained to Mugambi
the thing that he had in mind, and told Akut to follow
the directions of the black.
<P>
"I will join you again in a few days," he said.  "Now I go
ahead to learn what has become of the very bad white man
whom I seek."
<P>
At the next halt Tarzan took to the shore, and was soon
lost to the view of his people.
<P>
The first few villages he came to were deserted, showing
that news of the coming of his pack had travelled rapidly;
but toward evening he came upon a distant cluster of thatched
huts surrounded by a rude palisade, within which were a
couple of hundred natives.
<P>
The women were preparing the evening meal as Tarzan of
the Apes poised above them in the branches of a giant tree
which overhung the palisade at one point.
<P>
The ape-man was at a loss as to how he might enter into
communication with these people without either frightening
them or arousing their savage love of battle.  He had no desire
to fight now, for he was upon a much more important mission
than that of battling with every chance tribe that he
should happen to meet with.
<P>
At last he hit upon a plan, and after seeing that he was
concealed from the view of those below, he gave a few hoarse
grunts in imitation of a panther.  All eyes immediately turned
upward toward the foliage above.
<P>
It was growing dark, and they could not penetrate the leafy
screen which shielded the ape-man from their view.  The moment
that he had won their attention he raised his voice to
the shriller and more hideous scream of the beast he personated,
and then, scarce stirring a leaf in his descent, dropped
to the ground once again outside the palisade, and, with the
speed of a deer, ran quickly round to the village gate.
<P>
Here he beat upon the fibre-bound saplings of which the
barrier was constructed, shouting to the natives in their own
tongue that he was a friend who wished food and shelter for
the night.
<P>
Tarzan knew well the nature of the black man.  He was
aware that the grunting and screaming of Sheeta in the tree
above them would set their nerves on edge, and that his
pounding upon their gate after dark would still further add
to their terror.
<P>
That they did not reply to his hail was no surprise, for
natives are fearful of any voice that comes out of the night
from beyond their palisades, attributing it always to some
demon or other ghostly visitor; but still he continued to call.
<P>
"Let me in, my friends!" he cried.  "I am a white man
pursuing the very bad white man who passed this way a few
days ago.  I follow to punish him for the sins he has committed
against you and me.
<P>
"If you doubt my friendship, I will prove it to you by going
into the tree above your village and driving Sheeta back into
the jungle before he leaps among you.  If you will not promise
to take me in and treat me as a friend I shall let Sheeta stay
and devour you."
<P>
For a moment there was silence.  Then the voice of an old
man came out of the quiet of the village street.
<P>
"If you are indeed a white man and a friend, we will let
you come in; but first you must drive Sheeta away."
<P>
"Very well," replied Tarzan.  "Listen, and you shall hear
Sheeta fleeing before me."
<P>
The ape-man returned quickly to the tree, and this time he
made a great noise as he entered the branches, at the same
time growling ominously after the manner of the panther, so that
those below would believe that the great beast was still there.
<P>
When he reached a point well above the village street he
made a great commotion, shaking the tree violently, crying
aloud to the panther to flee or be killed, and punctuating his
own voice with the screams and mouthings of an angry beast.
<P>
Presently he raced toward the opposite side of the tree and
off into the jungle, pounding loudly against the boles of trees
as he went, and voicing the panther's diminishing growls as
he drew farther and farther away from the village.
<P>
A few minutes later he returned to the village gate, calling
to the natives within.
<P>
"I have driven Sheeta away," he said.  "Now come and
admit me as you promised."
<P>
For a time there was the sound of excited discussion within
the palisade, but at length a half-dozen warriors came and
opened the gates, peering anxiously out in evident trepidation
as to the nature of the creature which they should find
waiting there.  They were not much relieved at sight of an
almost naked white man; but when Tarzan had reassured
them in quiet tones, protesting his friendship for them,
they opened the barrier a trifle farther and admitted him.
<P>
When the gates had been once more secured the self-confidence
of the savages returned, and as Tarzan walked up the village street
toward the chief's hut he was surrounded by a host of curious men,
women, and children.
<P>
From the chief he learned that Rokoff had passed up the
river a week previous, and that he had horns growing from
his forehead, and was accompanied by a thousand devils.  
Later the chief said that the very bad white man had remained
a month in his village.
<P>
Though none of these statements agreed with Kaviri's, that
the Russian was but three days gone from the chieftain's
village and that his following was much smaller than now stated,
Tarzan was in no manner surprised at the discrepancies, for
he was quite familiar with the savage mind's strange manner
of functioning.
<P>
What he was most interested in knowing was that he was upon
the right trail, and that it led toward the interior.  In this
circumstance he knew that Rokoff could never escape him.
<P>
After several hours of questioning and cross-questioning
the ape-man learned that another party had preceded the
Russian by several days--three whites--a man, a woman,
and a little man-child, with several Mosulas.
<P>
Tarzan explained to the chief that his people would follow
him in a canoe, probably the next day, and that though he
might go on ahead of them the chief was to receive them
kindly and have no fear of them, for Mugambi would see
that they did not harm the chief's people, if they were
accorded a friendly reception.
<P>
"And now," he concluded, "I shall lie down beneath this
tree and sleep.  I am very tired.  Permit no one to disturb me."
<P>
The chief offered him a hut, but Tarzan, from past experience
of native dwellings, preferred the open air, and, further,
he had plans of his own that could be better carried out
if he remained beneath the tree.  He gave as his reason a
desire to be close at hand should Sheeta return, and after this
explanation the chief was very glad to permit him to sleep
beneath the tree.
<P>
Tarzan had always found that it stood him in good stead
to leave with natives the impression that he was to some
extent possessed of more or less miraculous powers.  He might
easily have entered their village without recourse to the
gates, but he believed that a sudden and unaccountable
disappearance when he was ready to leave them would result
in a more lasting impression upon their childlike minds, and
so as soon as the village was quiet in sleep he rose, and,
leaping into the branches of the tree above him, faded silently
into the black mystery of the jungle night.
<P>
All the balance of that night the ape-man swung rapidly
through the upper and middle terraces of the forest.  When the
going was good there he preferred the upper branches of the
giant trees, for then his way was better lighted by the moon;
but so accustomed were all his senses to the grim world of
his birth that it was possible for him, even in the dense,
black shadows near the ground, to move with ease and rapidity.  
You or I walking beneath the arcs of Main Street, or Broadway,
or State Street, could not have moved more surely or with
a tenth the speed of the agile ape-man through the
gloomy mazes that would have baffled us entirely.
<P>
At dawn he stopped to feed, and then he slept for several
hours, taking up the pursuit again toward noon.
<P>
Twice he came upon natives, and, though he had considerable
difficulty in approaching them, he succeeded in each
instance in quieting both their fears and bellicose intentions
toward him, and learned from them that he was upon the trail
of the Russian.
<P>
Two days later, still following up the Ugambi, he came
upon a large village.  The chief, a wicked-looking fellow with
the sharp-filed teeth that often denote the cannibal, received
him with apparent friendliness.
<P>
The ape-man was now thoroughly fatigued, and had determined
to rest for eight or ten hours that he might be fresh
and strong when he caught up with Rokoff, as he was sure
he must do within a very short time.
<P>
The chief told him that the bearded white man had left his
village only the morning before, and that doubtless he would
be able to overtake him in a short time.  The other party the
chief had not seen or heard of, so he said.
<P>
Tarzan did not like the appearance or manner of the fellow,
who seemed, though friendly enough, to harbour a certain
contempt for this half-naked white man who came with no
followers and offered no presents; but he needed the rest and
food that the village would afford him with less effort than
the jungle, and so, as he knew no fear of man, beast, or
devil, he curled himself up in the shadow of a hut and was
soon asleep.
<P>
Scarcely had he left the chief than the latter called two of
his warriors, to whom he whispered a few instructions.  
A moment later the sleek, black bodies were racing along the
river path, up-stream, toward the east.
<P>
In the village the chief maintained perfect quiet.  He would
permit no one to approach the sleeping visitor, nor any
singing, nor loud talking.  He was remarkably solicitous
lest his guest be disturbed.
<P>
Three hours later several canoes came silently into view
from up the Ugambi.  They were being pushed ahead rapidly
by the brawny muscles of their black crews.  Upon the bank
before the river stood the chief, his spear raised in a
horizontal position above his head, as though in some
manner of predetermined signal to those within the boats.
<P>
And such indeed was the purpose of his attitude--which
meant that the white stranger within his village still
slept peacefully.
<P>
In the bows of two of the canoes were the runners that the
chief had sent forth three hours earlier.  It was evident that
they had been dispatched to follow and bring back this party,
and that the signal from the bank was one that had been
determined upon before they left the village.
<P>
In a few moments the dugouts drew up to the verdure-clad bank.  
The native warriors filed out, and with them a half-dozen
white men.  Sullen, ugly-looking customers they were,
and none more so than the evil-faced, black-bearded man
who commanded them.
<P>
"Where is the white man your messengers report to be
with you?" he asked of the chief.
<P>
"This way, bwana," replied the native.  "Carefully have
I kept silence in the village that he might be still asleep when
you returned.  I do not know that he is one who seeks you to
do you harm, but he questioned me closely about your coming
and your going, and his appearance is as that of the one
you described, but whom you believed safe in the country
which you called Jungle Island.
<P>
"Had you not told me this tale I should not have recognized
him, and then he might have gone after and slain you.  
If he is a friend and no enemy, then no harm has been done,
bwana; but if he proves to be an enemy, I should like very
much to have a rifle and some ammunition."
<P>
"You have done well," replied the white man, "and you
shall have the rifle and ammunition whether he be a friend
or enemy, provided that you stand with me."
<P>
"I shall stand with you, bwana," said the chief,
"and now come and look upon the stranger, who sleeps
within my village."
<P>
So saying, he turned and led the way toward the hut, in the
shadow of which the unconscious Tarzan slept peacefully.
<P>
Behind the two men came the remaining whites and a score
of warriors; but the raised forefingers of the chief and
his companion held them all to perfect silence.
<P>
As they turned the corner of the hut, cautiously and upon
tiptoe, an ugly smile touched the lips of the white as his eyes
fell upon the giant figure of the sleeping ape-man.
<P>
The chief looked at the other inquiringly.  The latter nodded
his head, to signify that the chief had made no mistake
in his suspicions.  Then he turned to those behind him and,
pointing to the sleeping man, motioned for them to seize
and bind him.
<P>
A moment later a dozen brutes had leaped upon the surprised
Tarzan, and so quickly did they work that he was securely
bound before he could make half an effort to escape.
<P>
Then they threw him down upon his back, and as his eyes
turned toward the crowd that stood near, they fell upon the
malign face of Nikolas Rokoff.
<P>
A sneer curled the Russian's lips.  He stepped quite close
to Tarzan.
<P>
"Pig!" he cried.  "Have you not learned sufficient
wisdom to keep away from Nikolas Rokoff?"
<P>
Then he kicked the prostrate man full in the face.
<P>
"That for your welcome," he said.
<P>
"Tonight, before my Ethiop friends eat you, I shall tell
you what has already befallen your wife and child, and what
further plans I have for their futures."
