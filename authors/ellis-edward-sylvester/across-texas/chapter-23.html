<p>I <em>MUST </em>not omit to say that during the days occupied
in the long ride toward the northwest, our friends saw Indians
more than once. They were generally straggling parties, who viewed
the three horsemen with as much curiosity as our friends studied
them. They were either Comanches or Kioways, though the hunting
grounds of the latter were far to the eastward. Close to the New
Mexican boundary they observed a half dozen warriors, who the
Texans said were Apaches. They followed the whites for one afternoon,
discharging their guns from a distance, and more than once seemed
on the point of attacking them; but a shot from Lattin wounded
a dusky raider badly, after which all drew off and were seen no
more.</p>

<p>The sight of a white man riding toward them, with the evident
purpose of a meeting, centred the interest of the three on him.
He was mounted on a wiry "plug," and as he drew near was seen
to be one of those individuals occasionally met in the wildest
parts of the great West a generation ago. He belonged to the trappers
and hunters, who, leaving the confines of civilization at the
close of the summer season, spent the severe winters in trapping
beavers, otters, and other fur-bearing animals. They faced the
perils of vengeful red men, wild beasts, and the rigorous winters
for the sake of the pittance paid at the frontier posts and towns
for the scant peltries carried thither.</p>

<p>The man who rode up had but the single animal, his worldly possessions
being strapped in place behind him, while his long, old-fashioned
rifle rested across the saddle in front. His dress may be described
as a cross between that of a cowboy and an Indian. His hat was
of the sombrero order, but he wore a skin hunting shirt, leggings
and moccasins, and possessed a massive frame which must have been
the repository of immense strength.</p>

<p>His face was a study. His hair was long, and, like the beard
that covered his face, plentifully sprinkled with gray. His small
eyes were light in color, restless, bright, and twinkling; his
nose large and Roman in form, and his voice a mellow bass.</p>

<p>The trapper was yet several rods distant when Lattin exclaimed
in a surprised undertone:</p>

<p>"Why, that’s old Eph, as sure as I live!"</p>

<p>"So it is," added Strubell; "I haven’t seen him for years."</p>

<p>The hunter recognized the Texan at the same moment, and the movement
of his heavy beard showed he was smiling, though it was impossible
to see his mouth. He uttered a hearty salutation as he came forward,
and grasped each hand in turn, being introduced by Strubell to
Herbert, who noticed the searching look he fixed for a moment
on his face.</p>

<p>"I’m glad to know you, younker," he said, almost crushing his
hand; "but I’m s’prised to meet you so soon after seeing another;
I aint used to running agin boys in this part of the world; but
things seem to be gettin’ endways the last few years, and I’ve
made up my mind thar’s powerful little in the trappin’ bus’ness
any longer."</p>

<p>Eph Bozeman, as Strubell announced him, proved by the words just
uttered that he had seen Nick Ribsam, and therefore must have
news to impart. Since he had come directly over the trail of the
horse thieves, the Texans had suspected the other fact before
he made it known.</p>

<p>After the exchange of a few questions and answers, during which
Bozeman stated that he was on his way to Austin to hunt up an
old friend, who had been engaged for a number of years in buying
and selling mustangs, Strubell explained the business that had
brought him and his companions over the border into New Mexico.</p>

<p>"How far are we behind Rickard and the others?"</p>

<p>The trapper turned in his saddle and looked to the rear for a
few seconds without speaking. His forehead was wrinkled with thought,
but it did not take him long to answer the question.</p>

<p>"You are thirty-five miles or tharabouts from the Pecos, and
Bell and Harman will cross the stream about noon, which is two
hours off, so you may say thar is thirty miles atween you."</p>

<p>"There wasn’t more than a dozen when we started," was the remark
of the disgusted Lattin, "so we have been losing ground for more
than a week that we’ve been chasing ‘em."</p>

<p>"Thar can’t be any doubt of that ‘cordin’ to your own words,"
replied the trapper; "but if you keep on you’ll be up with ‘em
by the end of two days."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?" asked Strubell.</p>

<p>"‘Cause they’re goin’ to stop at the ranch layin’ just beyond."</p>

<p>Strubell and Lattin exchanged glances, and Herbert, who was watching
them, was satisfied that the news did not surprise them. They
had expected it from the first or they would not have persevered
thus far.</p>

<p>"I met ‘em yesterday," continued Bozeman, "not fur back; they
had halted to cook a young antelope that Harman shot, and I jined
in on the chorus."</p>

<p>"What did they say to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothin’ in partic’lar; I told ‘em whar I was goin’, and asked
‘em what they war doin’ in this part of the world. They said they
war on thar way to look at that ranch I spoke about on t’other
side of the Pecos, and it might be they would spend some time
thar."</p>

<p>"Did they say anything about the boy with them?" asked Herbert,
whose curiosity was at the highest point.</p>

<p>"Yas—consid’rable. I asked who he was and whar he come from;
Bell told me he was a younker as wanted to take a trip through
Texas fur his health—though he’s the healthiest younker I’ve looked
on for many a day—and tharfur they war takin’ him along."</p>

<p>"Did you have anything to say to Nick?"</p>

<p>"Who’s Nick?" asked the trapper, with another movement of the
beard around his mouth that showed he was smiling.</p>

<p>"He’s the boy—my friend that we’re looking after."</p>

<p>"I shook hands with him, give him some good advice that he thanked
me for, and that was all."</p>

<p>"I suppose he was afraid to say anything more."</p>

<p>"It must have been that; Bell and Harman watched him powerful
close, and though he looked as if he would like to add something,
he didn’t. I tell you," continued the trapper, addressing Strubell
and the others, "I s’pected something was wrong, though I didn’t
say nothin’, ‘cause thar warn’t any show for me doin’ anything.
I’m s’prised to hear what you say, and, boys, if you want me to
give you any help, I’m yours to command."</p>

<p>This was said with a heartiness that left no doubt of its sincerity.
His friends were delighted with the offer, and Herbert especially
was sure that no better thing could happen. He assured old Eph
he should be well paid for his trouble. The trapper did not refuse,
though his proposal was made without any idea of the kind; but,
as he confessed, matters had gone ill with him for a long time,
and he was in need of all he could honestly earn.</p>

<p>He had known Rickard and Slidham for ten years, and was aware
of the crooked business in which they were engaged; but, inasmuch
as they did not cross his path, there was no cause to quarrel
with them. He had spent more than one night in their company,
and would not hesitate to do so again, without misgiving; but
when he learned of their high-handed outrage, his sturdy nature
was filled with wrath, and he declared himself eager not only
to help rescue the boy, but to punish them for their crime.</p>

<p>This decision was reached within ten minutes after the handshaking,
and the trapper wheeled his pony around and joined in the pursuit
without further delay.</p>

<p>Since it was clear that the others could not be overtaken until
they made their final halt, the pursuers let down in their pace,
and allowed their animals to follow at a leisurely rate.</p>

<p>It struck Herbert as very strange that the destination of the
enemies and friends of Nick Ribsam should be the same. Though
the former could not have caught sight of their pursuers, they
must have known of it, and were now about to stop and give them
time to come up, and make battle, if they chose, for the possession
of the young man, who, without any fault of his own, had become
the bone of contention.</p>

<p>There was something about the business that he could not understand;
but by listening to the stealthy conversation of his friends he
gained an inkling of the truth. He learned, too, that they were
less hopeful of success than he. The almost endless pursuit, however,
was drawing to a close, and the end, whatever it might be, was
at hand.</p>
