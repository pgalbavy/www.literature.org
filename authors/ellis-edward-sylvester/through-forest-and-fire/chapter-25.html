<p>But Nick Ribsam was full of grit, and, though every step he took
caused him pain, he persevered with that grim resolution that
was a part of his nature from his very birth.</p>

<p>After walking some distance he found the soreness and stiffness
leaving him, and he straightened up with something of his natural
vim and elasticity of spirits.</p>

<p>"There's one thing certain," he added, recalling his encounter
with the buck, "I didn't have any one to help me out of that scrape,
except the One who always helps him that helps himself; but I
never wanted a friend more than then, and, if it hadn't been for
that oak, it would have been the last of Nicholas Ribsam."</p>

<p>"There is another thing I have learned," he added, with that
glimmer of humor which was sure to show itself, "I know considerable
more than I did yesterday; I have a good idea of how it feels
when a wounded buck <em>raises</em> you, and, after this, I won't
shoot one of the creatures unless I'm sure of making a better
shot than I did a while ago&mdash;hallo!"</p>

<p>Well might he utter the last exclamation, for at that moment
he came upon the dead body of the buck, lying as he had fallen
on the earth, when at last he succumbed to the wound received
at the hands of Nick himself.</p>

<p>The boy stopped to examine it, for he was much impressed by the
discovery.</p>

<p>"That came very near ending in the death of us both: nothing
but the oak saved me. I wonder whether I am going right."</p>

<p>He raised his head from his examination, and looked about him,
but he was without the means of judging whether he was following
the proper direction or not. When leaving the scene of his encounter
with the deer, he had taken the course that seemed to be right,
without pausing until he could make himself certain in the matter.</p>

<p>This is pretty sure, in a majority of cases, to lead one astray,
but it so happened with Nick that he headed in a bee-line for
the camp, where the impatient Sam Harper was awaiting him.</p>

<p>But the error came afterward: he toiled forward without any guide,
and soon began to turn to the left, so that he was in reality
moving on the circumference of a large circle, without suspecting
how much he wandered from the true course.</p>

<p>This peculiar mistake is made by many who are lost in the wilderness,
and is supposed to be due to the fact that everybody is either
right or left handed, instead of being ambidextrous as we all
ought to be.</p>

<p>One side of the body being stronger than the other, we unconsciously
exert the limb on that side the most, and swerve from a straight
line, unless we have something to direct in the shape of a landmark
or guiding-post.</p>

<p>It was not until Nick had gone a long ways out of the right course
that he suspected his error: the appearance of the camp fire which
Sam Harper had kindled, was what led him to stop and make the
best investigation he could.</p>

<p>There was little else he could appeal to, and he was in doubt
as to whether that had not been kindled by some other party; but
fortunately, while he was debating the matter, he caught the faint
but distinct signal of his friend, who was on the point of starting
out to look for him.</p>

<p>Nick replied, and in the course of half an hour had joined Sam
and Herbert by the fire.</p>

<p>They were relieved beyond expression to see the figure of the
sturdy little fellow, as he emerged from the gloom, and took his
seat around the camp fire.</p>

<p>They noticed that he limped, and knew something unusual must
have taken place to delay him. He had the most attentive of listeners
when he related his dangerous encounter with the buck, which came
so nigh ending his life.</p>

<p>But, happily, he had come out without any serious injury, and
the lads attacked their supper with the keenest of appetites.</p>

<p>"The reason the buck did not kill you," said Herbert, "was because
he was disabled by the wound I gave him."</p>

<p>"He was struck by one bullet only, and that one was mine," said
Nick, who saw no sense in deferring to the absurd claims of the
youth.</p>

<p>"Possibly not, but we shall have to examine his carcass to make
sure of that."</p>

<p>"I don't believe we shall have much time to look after dead deer,"
said Sam, "for I believe we are in the neighborhood of the very
bear we're looking for."</p>

<p>His friends turned toward him for an explanation of this remark,
which was uttered with all seriousness.</p>

<p>"Bowser has been acting very queer for the last half-hour."</p>

<p>"I think he has acted queer all day," observed Nick.</p>

<p>"I did not consider him of much account until he saved me from
the rattlesnake this afternoon; after that, I'm ready to believe
he's got a good deal more sense than you are willing to think."</p>

<p>Then Sam told his story, and added that the hound had left the
vicinity of the fire several times, and, going some distance in
the woods, had come back, giving utterance to a peculiar whine.
At the same time he looked up in the face of his master with much
the same expression as he did when seeking to warn him of his
danger from the poisonous serpent.</p>

<p>"There he goes now!" suddenly exclaimed Sam; "just watch him!"</p>

<p>Bowser had been stretched out near enough to the fire to receive
much of its warmth, and appeared to be asleep. All at once he
threw up his head and sniffed the air, as though he scented something;
then he rose, with a low whine, and trotted straight out in the
gloom.</p>

<p>The lads listened attentively for some sound from him, but all
remained still. At the end of ten minutes he came trotting to
view again, and walked straight up to his master, looked up in
his face, wagging his tail, and whined again.</p>

<p>"You can depend on it," said Sam, "he has made some discovery,
though I have no idea what it is."</p>

<p>"Let's follow him and find out."</p>

<p>It was Nick Ribsam who made the proposal; the others were inclined
to hold back, but the plucky little fellow insisted, and it was
agreed that Bowser's secret should be learned by keeping him company
to the spot which he visited.</p>
