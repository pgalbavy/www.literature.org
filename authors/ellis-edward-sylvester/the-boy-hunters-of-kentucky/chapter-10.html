<p>It looked to the young hunters as though they had struck the
popular hour for the visitors to the salt lick.  They were no
more than fairly rid of the bisons when they were met by three
bears, that showed no wish to yield the path to them.  It was
this fact that led Will and George to take to their heels while
Jack Gedney held his ground.</p>

<p>Now, it was the season of the year, as I have said, when the
bears are generally in good condition.  You know that they are
what are called hibernating animals&mdash;that is, they spend most
of the winter in sleep, during which their nourishment is the
fat of their own bodies, though it is claimed that each sucks
his fore paw.  It is in the spring, when the bears come forth
from their winter’s sleep, that they are lean, fierce, and dangerous. 
In the autumn they are in such comfortable form that they will
not go far out of their way to harm any one, unless he first provokes
them.</p>

<p>Jack did not mean to fight the three bears single-handed. He
was impatient when he saw that there was just one apiece, and
that his two friends had fled.</p>

<p>"You’re my game," said Jack to himself, drawing his gun to his
shoulder and aiming at the foremost.</p>

<p>The latter was less than twenty yards away when he observed the
lads. He halted and raised his pig-like snout, while the others,
some distance to the rear, lumbered forward, not seeing the cause
that had checked their leader.</p>

<p>I must do the brothers credit, however, by making haste to say
that they had run but a short distance when both stopped as if
by one accord.</p>

<p>"This won’t do," said the elder; "if Jack makes a fight with
the bears we must help him."</p>

<p>"That’s what I think," added George, who, as he faced about,
raised the flint of his gun.</p>

<p>The sight was a stirring one.  There stood Jack with his gun
at his shoulder, and pointed at the front of the savage-looking
beast that had paused, as if from curiosity, and was looking at
him.  Close behind were the other two brutes, swinging along in
their awkward fashion, indifferent to the drama that must open
within the next few moments.</p>

<p>Both Will and George could have sent a bullet into the body of
the leading bear without stirring from where they stood, had they
been so minded, but one or two causes restrained them.</p>

<p>it was clear that, so to speak, the foremost brute belonged to
Jack himself, and he might well take offence if they should open
on him before it was seen that their help was needed.</p>

<p>Then, too, the instant the first one should be disposed of, the
others would demand attention.  The crack of the rifle, and the
fall or struggles of the brute, would tell his companions what
had taken place, even though Bruin is one of the most stupid of
animals.  Jack’s gun having been fired, it was more than likely
that he would be unable to re-load it in time to make defence
against the others.  He would have to leave them, therefore, for
his comrades to dispose of.  They knew that Jack would be able
to take care of his special charge unless some slip took place.
And that slip did take place.  The young hunter observed, while
his eye was running along the sights of his rifle, that a small
limb or twig, no thicker than his finger, reached across the trail
between him and the bear, so that it was in the exact line of
his fire.</p>

<p>While ordinarily this would have made no difference to the swift-speeding
bullet, yet the lad was wise enough to wait until the bear had
advanced far enough to shift the line out of the way.  This was
the cause of the brothers thinking that Jack held his aim a long
time.</p>

<p>At the instant of firing, however, a slight puff of wind stirred
the leaves and moved the twig, so that the stem bowed again across
the path of the bullet.</p>

<p>The consequence was that the ball was turned just enough out
of its course to wound instead of killing the brute.  It chipped
its way through a corner of the skull without making a fatal hurt,
though it was one that roused all the fury of the enormous beast.</p>

<p>Will and George, who were closely watching events, were sure
that Jack had killed Bruin, who reared on his hind legs and swung
his paws as if trying to draw the supposed splinters from his
flesh. Then, instead of toppling over like a small mountain, he
made straight for the young man who he well knew had caused his
hurt.</p>

<p>Jack Gedney, like his young friends, was astonished at this proof
that he had made a failure.  He stood for a moment, waiting for
the royal game to fall to the ground, but the vigour of the beast
told plainly enough that there was a dangerous amount of life
left in him.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this alarming truth did not break upon Jack until
the beast was on him.  He knew better than to try to re-load his
gun, but hastily clubbing it, he swung it back over his shoulder,
and brought the stock down on the head of the bear with the utmost
strength he could command.</p>

<p>It may be said that the blow for one of the boy’s years was powerful,
but it did no more harm when it landed on the iron-like skull
of Bruin than if it had been a feather-duster.  Instead of striking
squarely, it glanced with such force that the weapon flew twenty
feet out of the hands of the owner.</p>

<p>By this time, as you may well suppose, Will and George discovered
the peril of their friend, and hastened to his rescue; but the
seconds passed fast, and the bear had reared for the purpose of
seizing Jack, whose blow was descending before the brothers brought
their own guns to their shoulders and fired.</p>

<p>They had no time to run closer or to make their aim as effective
as they wished, but they sent both bullets into the big black
body that rose in front of the brave boy.  The result was what
you can well understand: Bruin was hit hard, but for a time at
least he was as strong as ever, while his rage was the more intensified.</p>

<p>He reached out both ponderous paws to seize Jack, who, had he
been caught, would have received a hug sufficient to crush all
the bones in his body to a pulp; but with a dexterity and coolness
wonderful in one of his years, he dropped down, so that the paws
clasped vacancy over his head, and, darting to one side, he made
a dash to the nearest sapling.</p>

<p>When the animal turned to see what had become of his victim,
he observed him dashing off in a full run.  Heavy and clumsy as
is the bear, he is capable of considerable speed, and the one
of which I am telling you dropped upon all fours, swung around,
and made after the boy with astonishing dexterity.</p>

<p>It need not be said that Jack did not let the grass grow under
his feet. Fortunately, indeed, for him that he did not have far
to run before he flung his arms and legs about a small tree, up
which he began travelling with desperate energy.</p>

<p>As it was, his pursuer was so close, that when he reared again,
and reached upward with his paws, his long sharp nails rattled
against one of Jack’s shoes. The boy jerked up both feet as though
he had felt the fangs of a rattlesnake, and one more hitch took
him beyond reach of the brute. </p>
