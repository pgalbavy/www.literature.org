<p>When night had fallen Tarzan donned the mask and the dead tail of the
priest he had slain in the vaults beneath the temple. He judged that it
would not do to attempt again to pass the guard, especially so late at
night as it would be likely to arouse comment and suspicion, and so he
swung into the tree that overhung the garden wall and from its branches
dropped to the ground beyond.
</p>
<p>Avoiding too grave risk of apprehension the ape-man passed through the
grounds to the court of the palace, approaching the temple from the
side opposite to that at which he had left it at the time of his
escape. He came thus it is true through a portion of the grounds with
which he was unfamiliar but he preferred this to the danger of
following the beaten track between the palace apartments and those of
the temple. Having a definite goal in mind and endowed as he was with
an almost miraculous sense of location he moved with great assurance
through the shadows of the temple yard.
</p><p>Taking advantage of the denser shadows close to the walls and of what
shrubs and trees there were he came without mishap at last to the
ornate building concerning the purpose of which he had asked Lu-don
only to be put off with the assertion that it was forgotten--nothing
strange in itself but given possible importance by the apparent
hesitancy of the priest to discuss its use and the impression the
ape-man had gained at the time that Lu-don lied.
</p><p>And now he stood at last alone before the structure which was three
stories in height and detached from all the other temple buildings. It
had a single barred entrance which was carved from the living rock in
representation of the head of a GRYF, whose wide-open mouth constituted
the doorway. The head, hood, and front paws of the creature were
depicted as though it lay crouching with its lower jaw on the ground
between its outspread paws. Small oval windows, which were likewise
barred, flanked the doorway.
</p><p>Seeing that the coast was clear, Tarzan stepped into the darkened
entrance where he tried the bars only to discover that they were
ingeniously locked in place by some device with which he was unfamiliar
and that they also were probably too strong to be broken even if he
could have risked the noise which would have resulted. Nothing was
visible within the darkened interior and so, momentarily baffled, he
sought the windows. Here also the bars refused to yield up their
secret, but again Tarzan was not dismayed since he had counted upon
nothing different.
</p><p>If the bars would not yield to his cunning they would yield to his
giant strength if there proved no other means of ingress, but first he
would assure himself that this latter was the case.  Moving entirely
around the building he examined it carefully.  There were other windows
but they were similarly barred. He stopped often to look and listen but
he saw no one and the sounds that he heard were too far away to cause
him any apprehension.
</p><p>He glanced above him at the wall of the building. Like so many of the
other walls of the city, palace, and temple, it was ornately carved and
there were too the peculiar ledges that ran sometimes in a horizontal
plane and again were tilted at an angle, giving ofttimes an impression
of irregularity and even crookedness to the buildings. It was not a
difficult wall to climb, at least not difficult for the ape-man.
</p><p>But he found the bulky and awkward headdress a considerable handicap
and so he laid it aside upon the ground at the foot of the wall. Nimbly
he ascended to find the windows of the second floor not only barred but
curtained within. He did not delay long at the second floor since he
had in mind an idea that he would find the easiest entrance through the
roof which he had noticed was roughly dome shaped like the throneroom
of Ko-tan. Here there were apertures. He had seen them from the ground,
and if the construction of the interior resembled even slightly that of
the throneroom, bars would not be necessary upon these apertures, since
no one could reach them from the floor of the room.
</p><p>There was but a single question: would they be large enough to admit
the broad shoulders of the ape-man.
</p><p>He paused again at the third floor, and here, in spite of the hangings,
he saw that the interior was lighted and simultaneously there came to
his nostrils from within a scent that stripped from him temporarily any
remnant of civilization that might have remained and left him a fierce
and terrible bull of the jungles of Kerchak. So sudden and complete was
the metamorphosis that there almost broke from the savage lips the
hideous challenge of his kind, but the cunning brute-mind saved him
this blunder.
</p><p>And now he heard voices within--the voice of Lu-don he could have
sworn, demanding. And haughty and disdainful came the answering words
though utter hopelessness spoke in the tones of this other voice which
brought Tarzan to the pinnacle of frenzy.
</p><p>The dome with its possible apertures was forgotten. Every consideration
of stealth and quiet was cast aside as the ape-man drew back his mighty
fist and struck a single terrific blow upon the bars of the small
window before him, a blow that sent the bars and the casing that held
them clattering to the floor of the apartment within.
</p><p>Instantly Tarzan dove headforemost through the aperture carrying the
hangings of antelope hide with him to the floor below.  Leaping to his
feet he tore the entangling pelt from about his head only to find
himself in utter darkness and in silence. He called aloud a name that
had not passed his lips for many weary months. "Jane, Jane," he cried,
"where are you?" But there was only silence in reply.
</p><p>Again and again he called, groping with outstretched hands through the
Stygian blackness of the room, his nostrils assailed and his brain
tantalized by the delicate effluvia that had first assured him that his
mate had been within this very room. And he had heard her dear voice
combatting the base demands of the vile priest. Ah, if he had but acted
with greater caution! If he had but continued to move with quiet and
stealth he might even at this moment be holding her in his arms while
the body of Lu-don, beneath his foot, spoke eloquently of vengeance
achieved. But there was no time now for idle self-reproaches.
</p><p>He stumbled blindly forward, groping for he knew not what till suddenly
the floor beneath him tilted and he shot downward into a darkness even
more utter than that above. He felt his body strike a smooth surface
and he realized that he was hurtling downward as through a polished
chute while from above there came the mocking tones of a taunting laugh
and the voice of Lu-don screamed after him: "Return to thy father, O
Dor-ul-Otho!"
</p><p>The ape-man came to a sudden and painful stop upon a rocky floor.
Directly before him was an oval window crossed by many bars, and beyond
he saw the moonlight playing on the waters of the blue lake below.
Simultaneously he was conscious of a familiar odor in the air of the
chamber, which a quick glance revealed in the semidarkness as of
considerable proportion.
</p><p>It was the faint, but unmistakable odor of the GRYF, and now Tarzan
stood silently listening. At first he detected no sounds other than
those of the city that came to him through the window overlooking the
lake; but presently, faintly, as though from a distance he heard the
shuffling of padded feet along a stone pavement, and as he listened he
was aware that the sound approached.
</p><p>Nearer and nearer it came, and now even the breathing of the beast was
audible. Evidently attracted by the noise of his descent into its
cavernous retreat it was approaching to investigate. He could not see
it but he knew that it was not far distant, and then, deafeningly there
reverberated through those gloomy corridors the mad bellow of the GRYF.
</p><p>Aware of the poor eyesight of the beast, and his own eyes now grown
accustomed to the darkness of the cavern, the ape-man sought to elude
the infuriated charge which he well knew no living creature could
withstand. Neither did he dare risk the chance of experimenting upon
this strange GRYF with the tactics of the Tor-o-don that he had found
so efficacious upon that other occasion when his life and liberty had
been the stakes for which he cast. In many respects the conditions were
dissimilar. Before, in broad daylight, he had been able to approach the
GRYF under normal conditions in its natural state, and the GRYF itself
was one that he had seen subjected to the authority of man, or at least
of a manlike creature; but here he was confronted by an imprisoned
beast in the full swing of a furious charge and he had every reason to
suspect that this GRYF might never have felt the restraining influence
of authority, confined as it was in this gloomy pit to serve likely but
the single purpose that Tarzan had already seen so graphically
portrayed in his own experience of the past few moments.
</p><p>To elude the creature, then, upon the possibility of discovering some
loophole of escape from his predicament seemed to the ape-man the
wisest course to pursue. Too much was at stake to risk an encounter
that might be avoided--an encounter the outcome of which there was
every reason to apprehend would seal the fate of the mate that he had
just found, only to lose again so harrowingly. Yet high as his
disappointment and chagrin ran, hopeless as his present estate now
appeared, there tingled in the veins of the savage lord a warm glow of
thanksgiving and elation.  She lived! After all these weary months of
hopelessness and fear he had found her. She lived!
</p><p>To the opposite side of the chamber, silently as the wraith of a
disembodied soul, the swift jungle creature moved from the path of the
charging Titan that, guided solely in the semi-darkness by its keen
ears, bore down upon the spot toward which Tarzan's noisy entrance into
its lair had attracted it. Along the further wall the ape-man hurried.
Before him now appeared the black opening of the corridor from which
the beast had emerged into the larger chamber. Without hesitation
Tarzan plunged into it. Even here his eyes, long accustomed to darkness
that would have seemed total to you or to me, saw dimly the floor and
the walls within a radius of a few feet--enough at least to prevent him
plunging into any unguessed abyss, or dashing himself upon solid rock
at a sudden turning.
</p><p>The corridor was both wide and lofty, which indeed it must be to
accommodate the colossal proportions of the creature whose habitat it
was, and so Tarzan encountered no difficulty in moving with reasonable
speed along its winding trail. He was aware as he proceeded that the
trend of the passage was downward, though not steeply, but it seemed
interminable and he wondered to what distant subterranean lair it might
lead. There was a feeling that perhaps after all he might better have
remained in the larger chamber and risked all on the chance of subduing
the GRYF where there was at least sufficient room and light to lend to
the experiment some slight chance of success. To be overtaken here in
the narrow confines of the black corridor where he was assured the GRYF
could not see him at all would spell almost certain death and now he
heard the thing approaching from behind. Its thunderous bellows fairly
shook the cliff from which the cavernous chambers were excavated. To
halt and meet this monstrous incarnation of fury with a futile whee-oo!
seemed to Tarzan the height of insanity and so he continued along the
corridor, increasing his pace as he realized that the GRYF was
overhauling him.
</p><p>Presently the darkness lessened and at the final turning of the passage
he saw before him an area of moonlight. With renewed hope he sprang
rapidly forward and emerged from the mouth of the corridor to find
himself in a large circular enclosure the towering white walls of which
rose high upon every side--smooth perpendicular walls upon the sheer
face of which was no slightest foothold. To his left lay a pool of
water, one side of which lapped the foot of the wall at this point. It
was, doubtless, the wallow and the drinking pool of the GRYF.
</p><p>And now the creature emerged from the corridor and Tarzan retreated to
the edge of the pool to make his last stand. There was no staff with
which to enforce the authority of his voice, but yet he made his stand
for there seemed naught else to do.  Just beyond the entrance to the
corridor the GRYF paused, turning its weak eyes in all directions as
though searching for its prey.  This then seemed the psychological
moment for his attempt and raising his voice in peremptory command the
ape-man voiced the weird whee-oo! of the Tor-o-don. Its effect upon the
GRYF was instantaneous and complete--with a terrific bellow it lowered
its three horns and dashed madly in the direction of the sound.
</p><p>To right nor to left was any avenue of escape, for behind him lay the
placid waters of the pool, while down upon him from before thundered
annihilation. The mighty body seemed already to tower above him as the
ape-man turned and dove into the dark waters.
</p><p>Dead in her breast lay hope. Battling for life during harrowing months
of imprisonment and danger and hardship it had fitfully flickered and
flamed only to sink after each renewal to smaller proportions than
before and now it had died out entirely leaving only cold, charred
embers that Jane Clayton knew would never again be rekindled. Hope was
dead as she faced Lu-don, the high priest, in her prison quarters in
the Temple of the Gryf at A-lur. Both time and hardship had failed to
leave their impress upon her physical beauty--the contours of her
perfect form, the glory of her radiant loveliness had defied them, yet
to these very attributes she owed the danger which now confronted her,
for Lu-don desired her. From the lesser priests she had been safe, but
from Lu-don, she was not safe, for Lu-don was not as they, since the
high priestship of Pal-ul-don may descend from father to son.
</p><p>Ko-tan, the king, had wanted her and all that had so far saved her from
either was the fear of each for the other, but at last Lu-don had cast
aside discretion and had come in the silent watches of the night to
claim her. Haughtily had she repulsed him, seeking ever to gain time,
though what time might bring her of relief or renewed hope she could
not even remotely conjecture.  A leer of lust and greed shone hungrily
upon his cruel countenance as he advanced across the room to seize her.
She did not shrink nor cower, but stood there very erect, her chin up,
her level gaze freighted with the loathing and contempt she felt for
him. He read her expression and while it angered him, it but increased
his desire for possession. Here indeed was a queen, perhaps a goddess;
fit mate for the high priest.
</p><p>"You shall not!" she said as he would have touched her. "One of us
shall die before ever your purpose is accomplished."
</p><p>He was close beside her now. His laugh grated upon her ears.  "Love
does not kill," he replied mockingly.
</p><p>He reached for her arm and at the same instant something clashed
against the bars of one of the windows, crashing them inward to the
floor, to be followed almost simultaneously by a human figure which
dove headforemost into the room, its head enveloped in the skin window
hangings which it carried with it in its impetuous entry.
</p><p>Jane Clayton saw surprise and something of terror too leap to the
countenance of the high priest and then she saw him spring forward and
jerk upon a leather thong that depended from the ceiling of the
apartment. Instantly there dropped from above a cunningly contrived
partition that fell between them and the intruder, effectively barring
him from them and at the same time leaving him to grope upon its
opposite side in darkness, since the only cresset the room contained
was upon their side of the partition.
</p><p>Faintly from beyond the wall Jane heard a voice calling, but whose it
was and what the words she could not distinguish. Then she saw Lu-don
jerk upon another thong and wait in evident expectancy of some
consequent happening. He did not have long to wait. She saw the thong
move suddenly as though jerked from above and then Lu-don smiled and
with another signal put in motion whatever machinery it was that raised
the partition again to its place in the ceiling.
</p><p>Advancing into that portion of the room that the partition had shut off
from them, the high priest knelt upon the floor, and down tilting a
section of it, revealed the dark mouth of a shaft leading below.
Laughing loudly he shouted into the hole: "Return to thy father, O
Dor-ul-Otho!"
</p><p>Making fast the catch that prevented the trapdoor from opening beneath
the feet of the unwary until such time as Lu-don chose the high priest
rose again to his feet.
</p><p>"Now, Beautiful One!" he cried, and then, "Ja-don! what do you here?"
</p><p>Jane Clayton turned to follow the direction of Lu-don's eyes and there
she saw framed in the entrance-way to the apartment the mighty figure
of a warrior, upon whose massive features sat an expression of stern
and uncompromising authority.
</p><p>"I come from Ko-tan, the king," replied Ja-don, "to remove the
beautiful stranger to the Forbidden Garden."
</p><p>"The king defies me, the high priest of Jad-ben-Otho?" cried Lu-don.
</p><p>"It is the king's command--I have spoken," snapped Ja-don, in whose
manner was no sign of either fear or respect for the priest.
</p><p>Lu-don well knew why the king had chosen this messenger whose heresy
was notorious, but whose power had as yet protected him from the
machinations of the priest. Lu-don cast a surreptitious glance at the
thongs hanging from the ceiling. Why not? If he could but maneuver to
entice Ja-don to the opposite side of the chamber!
</p><p>"Come," he said in a conciliatory tone, "let us discuss the matter,"
and moved toward the spot where he would have Ja-don follow him.
</p><p>"There is nothing to discuss," replied Ja-don, yet he followed the
priest, fearing treachery.
</p><p>Jane watched them. In the face and figure of the warrior she found
reflected those admirable traits of courage and honor that the
profession of arms best develops. In the hypocritical priest there was
no redeeming quality. Of the two then she might best choose the
warrior. With him there was a chance--with Lu-don, none. Even the very
process of exchange from one prison to another might offer some
possibility of escape. She weighed all these things and decided, for
Lu-don's quick glance at the thongs had not gone unnoticed nor
uninterpreted by her.
</p><p>"Warrior," she said, addressing Ja-don, "if you would live enter not
that portion of the room."
</p><p>Lu-don cast an angry glance upon her. "Silence, slave!" he cried.
</p><p>"And where lies the danger?" Ja-don asked of Jane, ignoring Lu-don.
</p><p>The woman pointed to the thongs. "Look," she said, and before the high
priest could prevent she had seized that which controlled the partition
which shot downward separating Lu-don from the warrior and herself.
</p><p>Ja-don looked inquiringly at her. "He would have tricked me neatly but
for you," he said; "kept me imprisoned there while he secreted you
elsewhere in the mazes of his temple."
</p><p>"He would have done more than that," replied Jane, as she pulled upon
the other thong. "This releases the fastenings of a trapdoor in the
floor beyond the partition. When you stepped on that you would have
been precipitated into a pit beneath the temple.  Lu-don has threatened
me with this fate often. I do not know that he speaks the truth, but he
says that a demon of the temple is imprisoned there--a huge GRYF."
</p><p>"There is a GRYF within the temple," said Ja-don. "What with it and the
sacrifices, the priests keep us busy supplying them with prisoners,
though the victims are sometimes those for whom Lu-don has conceived
hatred among our own people. He has had his eyes upon me for a long
time. This would have been his chance but for you. Tell me, woman, why
you warned me. Are we not all equally your jailers and your enemies?"
</p><p>"None could be more horrible than Lu-don," she replied; "and you have
the appearance of a brave and honorable warrior. I could not hope, for
hope has died and yet there is the possibility that among so many
fighting men, even though they be of another race than mine, there is
one who would accord honorable treatment to a stranger within his
gates--even though she be a woman."
</p><p>Ja-don looked at her for a long minute. "Ko-tan would make you his
queen," he said. "That he told me himself and surely that were
honorable treatment from one who might make you a slave."
</p><p>"Why, then, would he make me queen?" she asked.
</p><p>Ja-don came closer as though in fear his words might be overheard. "He
believes, although he did not tell me so in fact, that you are of the
race of gods. And why not? Jad-ben-Otho is tailless, therefore it is
not strange that Ko-tan should suspect that only the gods are thus. His
queen is dead leaving only a single daughter. He craves a son and what
more desirable than that he should found a line of rulers for
Pal-ul-don descended from the gods?"
</p><p>"But I am already wed," cried Jane. "I cannot wed another. I do not
want him or his throne."
</p><p>"Ko-tan is king," replied Ja-don simply as though that explained and
simplified everything.
</p><p>"You will not save me then?" she asked.
</p><p>"If you were in Ja-lur," he replied, "I might protect you, even against
the king."
</p><p>"What and where is Ja-lur?" she asked, grasping at any straw.
</p><p>"It is the city where I rule," he answered. "I am chief there and of
all the valley beyond."
</p><p>"Where is it?" she insisted, and "is it far?"
</p><p>"No," he replied, smiling, "it is not far, but do not think of
that--you could never reach it. There are too many to pursue and
capture you. If you wish to know, however, it lies up the river that
empties into Jad-ben-lul whose waters kiss the walls of A-lur--up the
western fork it lies with water upon three sides.  Impregnable city of
Pal-ul-don--alone of all the cities it has never been entered by a
foeman since it was built there while Jad-ben-Otho was a boy."
</p><p>"And there I would be safe?" she asked.
</p><p>"Perhaps," he replied.
</p><p>Ah, dead Hope; upon what slender provocation would you seek to glow
again! She sighed and shook her head, realizing the inutility of
Hope--yet the tempting bait dangled before her mind's eye--Ja-lur!
</p><p>"You are wise," commented Ja-don interpreting her sigh. "Come now, we
will go to the quarters of the princess beside the Forbidden Garden.
There you will remain with O-lo-a, the king's daughter. It will be
better than this prison you have occupied."
</p><p>"And Ko-tan?" she asked, a shudder passing through her slender frame.
</p><p>"There are ceremonies," explained Ja-don, "that may occupy several days
before you become queen, and one of them may be difficult of
arrangement." He laughed, then.
</p><p>"What?" she asked.
</p><p>"Only the high priest may perform the marriage ceremony for a king," he
explained.
</p><p>"Delay!" she murmured; "blessed delay!" Tenacious indeed of life is
Hope even though it be reduced to cold and lifeless char--a veritable
phoenix.
