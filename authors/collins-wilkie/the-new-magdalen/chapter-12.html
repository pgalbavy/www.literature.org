<P>
JULIAN happened to be standing nearest to Mercy. He was the first
at her side when she fell.
<P>
In the cry of alarm which burst from him, as he raised her for a
moment in his arms, in the expression of his eyes when he looked
at her death-like face, there escaped the plain--too
plain--confession of the interest which he felt in her, of the
admiration which she had aroused in him. Horace detected it.
There was the quick suspicion of jealousy in the movement by
which he joined Julian; there was the ready resentment of
jealousy in the tone in which he pronounced the words, "Leave her
to me." Julian resigned her in silence. A faint flush appeared on
his pale face as he drew back while Horace carried her to the
sofa. His eyes sunk to the ground; he seemed to be meditating
self-reproachfully on the tone in which his friend had spoken to
him. After having been the first to take an active part in
meeting the calamity that had happened, he was now, to all
appearance, insensible to everything that was passing in the
room.
<P>
A touch on his shoulder roused him.
<P>
He turned and looked round. The woman who had done the
mischief--the stranger in the poor black garments--was standing
behind him. She pointed to the prostrate figure on the sofa, with
a merciless smile.
<P>
"You wanted a proof just now," she said. "There it is!"
<P>
Horace heard her. He suddenly left the sofa and joined Julian.
His face, naturally ruddy, was pale with suppressed fury.
<P>
"Take that wretch away!" he said. "Instantly! or I won't answer
for what I may do."
<P>
Those words recalled Julian to himself. He looked round the room.
Lady Janet and the housekeeper were together, in attendance on
the swooning woman. The startled servants were congregated in the
library doorway. One of them offered to run to the nearest
doctor; another asked if he should fetch the police. Julian
silenced them by a gesture, and turned to Horace. "Compose
yourself," he said. "Leave me to remove her quietly from the
house." He took Grace by the hand as he spoke. She hesitated, and
tried to release herself. Julian pointed to the group at the
sofa, and to the servants looking on. "You have made an enemy of
every one in this room," he said, "and you have not a friend in
London. Do you wish to make an enemy of _me?_ Her head drooped;
she made no reply; she waited, dumbly obedient to the firmer will
than her own. Julian ordered the servants crowding together in
the doorway to withdraw. He followed them into the library,
leading Grace after him by the hand. Before closing the door he
paused, and looked back into the dining-room.
<P>
"Is she recovering?" he asked, after a moment's hesitation.
<P>
Lady Janet's voice answered him. "Not yet."
<P>
"Shall I send for the nearest doctor?"
<P>
Horace interposed. He declined to let Julian associate himself,
even in that indirect manner, with Mercy's recovery.
<P>
"If the doctor is wanted," he said, "I will go for him myself."
<P>
Julian closed the library door. He absently released Grace; he
mechanically pointed to a chair. She sat down in silent surprise,
following him with her eyes as he walked slowly to and fro in the
room.
<P>
For the moment his mind was far away from her, and from all that
had happened since her appearance in the house. It was impossible
that a man of his fineness of perception could mistake the
meaning of Horace's conduct toward him. He was questioning his
own heart, on the subject of Mercy, sternly and unreservedly as
it was his habit to do. "After only once seeing her," he thought,
"has she produced such an impression on me that Horace can
discover it, before I have even suspected it myself? Can the time
have come already when I owe it to my friend to see her no more?"
He stopped irritably in his walk. As a man devoted to a serious
calling in life, there was something that wounded his
self-respect in the bare suspicion that he could be guilty of the
purely sentimental extravagance called "love at first sight."
<P>
He had paused exactly opposite to the chair in which Grace was
seated. Weary of the silence, she seized the opportunity of
speaking to him.
<P>
"I have come here with you as you wished," she said. "Are you
going to help me? Am I to count on you as my friend?"
<P>
He looked at her vacantly. It cost him an effort before he could
give her the attention that she had claimed.
<P>
"You have been hard on me," Grace went on. "But you showed me
some kindness at first; you tried to make them give me a fair
hearing. I ask you, as a just man, do you doubt now that the
woman on the sofa in the next room is an impostor who has taken
my place? Can there be any plainer confession that she is Mercy
Merrick than the confession she has made? _You_ saw it; _they_
saw it. She fainted at the sight of me."
<P>
Julian crossed the room--still without answering her--and rang
the bell. When the servant appeared, he told the man to fetch a
cab.
<P>
Grace rose from her chair. "What is the cab for?" she asked,
sharply.
<P>
"For you and for me," Julian replied. "I am going to take you
back to your lodgings."
<P>
"I refuse to go. My place is in this house. Neither Lady Janet
nor you can get over the plain facts. All I asked was to be
confronted with her. And what did she do when she came into the
room? She fainted at the sight of me."
<P>
Reiterating her one triumphant assertion, she fixed her eyes on
Julian with a look which said plainly: Answer that if you can. In
mercy to her, Julian answered it on the spot.
<P>
"As far as I understand," he said, "you appear to take it for
granted that no innocent woma n would have fainted on first
seeing you. I have something to tell you which will alter your
opinion. On her arrival in England this lady informed my aunt
that she had met with you accidentally on the French frontier,
and that she had seen you (so far as she knew) struck dead at her
side by a shell. Remember that, and recall what happened just
now. Without a word to warn her of your restoration to life, she
finds herself suddenly face to face with you, a living woman--and
this at a time when it is easy for any one who looks at her to
see that she is in delicate health. What is there wonderful, what
is there unaccountable, in her fainting under such circumstances
as these?"
<P>
The question was plainly put. Where was the answer to it?
<P>
There was no answer to it. Mercy's wisely candid statement of the
manner in which she had first met with Grace, and of the accident
which had followed had served Mercy's purpose but too well. It
was simply impossible for persons acquainted with that statement
to attach a guilty meaning to the swoon. The false Grace
Roseberry was still as far beyond the reach of suspicion as ever,
and the true Grace was quick enough to see it. She sank into the
chair from which she had risen; her hands fell in hopeless
despair on her lap.
<P>
"Everything is against me," she said. "The truth itself turns
liar, and takes _her_ side." She paused, and rallied her sinking
courage. "No!" she cried, resolutely, "I won't submit to have my
name and my place taken from me by a vile adventuress! Say what
you like, I insist on exposing her; I won't leave the house!"
<P>
The servant entered the room, and announced that the cab was at
the door.
<P>
Grace turned to Julian with a defiant wave of her hand. "Don't
let me detain you," she said. "I see I have neither advice nor
help to expect from Mr. Julian Gray."
<P>
Julian beckoned to the servant to follow him into a corner of the
room.
<P>
"Do you know if the doctor has been sent for?" he asked.
<P>
"I believe not, sir. It is said in the servants' hall that the
doctor is not wanted."
<P>
Julian was too anxious to be satisfied with a report from the
servants' hall. He hastily wrote on a slip of paper: "Has she
recovered?" and gave the note to the man, with directions to take
it to Lady Janet.
<P>
"Did you hear what I said?" Grace inquired, while the messenger
was absent in the dining room.
<P>
"I will answer you directly," said Julian.
<P>
The servant appeared again as he spoke, with some lines in pencil
written by Lady Janet on the back of Julian's note. "Thank God,
we have revived her. In a few minutes we hope to be able to take
her to her room."
<P>
The nearest way to Mercy's room was through the library. Grace's
immediate removal had now become a necessity which was not to be
trifled with. Julian addressed himself to meeting the difficulty
the instant he was left alone with Grace.
<P>
"Listen to me," he said. "The cab is waiting, and I have my last
words to say to you. You are now (thanks to the consul's
recommendation) in my care. Decide at once whether you will
remain under my charge, or whether you will transfer yourself to
the charge of the police."
<P>
Grace started. "What do you mean?" she asked, angrily.
<P>
"If you wish to remain under my charge," Julian proceeded, "you
will accompany me at once to the cab. In that case I will
undertake to give you an opportunity of telling your story to my
own lawyer. He will be a fitter person to advise you than I am.
Nothing will induce we to believe that the lady whom you have
accused has committed, or is capable of committing, such a fraud
as you charge her with. You will hear what the lawyer thinks, if
you come with me. If you refuse, I shall have no choice but to
send into the next room, and tell them that you are still here.
The result will be that you will find yourself in charge of the
police. Take which course you like: I will give you a minute to
decide in. And remember this--if I appear to express myself
harshly, it is your conduct which forces me to speak out. I mean
kindly toward you; I am advising you honestly for your good."
<P>
He took out his watch to count the minute.
<P>
Grace stole one furtive glance at his steady, resolute face. She
was perfectly unmoved by the manly consideration for her which
Julian's last words had expressed. All she understood was that he
was not a man to be trifled with. Future opportunities would
offer themselves of returning secretly to the house. She
determined to yield--and deceive him.
<P>
"I am ready to go," she said, rising with dogged submission.
"Your turn now," she muttered to herself, as she turned to the
looking-glass to arrange her shawl. "My turn will come."
<P>
Julian advanced toward her, as if to offer her his arm, and
checked himself. Firmly persuaded as he was that her mind was
deranged--readily as he admitted that she claimed, in virtue of
her affliction, every indulgence that he could extend to
her--there was something repellent to him at that moment in the
bare idea of touching her. The image of the beautiful creature
who was the object of her monstrous accusation--the image of
Mercy as she lay helpless for a moment in his arms--was vivid in
his mind while he opened the door that led into the hall, and
drew back to let Grace pass out before him. He left the servant
to help her into the cab. The man respectfully addressed him as
he took his seat opposite to Grace.
<P>
"I am ordered to say that your room is ready, sir, and that her
ladyship expects you to dinner."
<P>
Absorbed in the events which had followed his aunt's invitation,
Julian had forgotten his engagement to stay at Mablethorpe House.
Could he return, knowing his own heart as he now knew it? Could
he honorably remain, perhaps for weeks together, in Mercy's
society, conscious as he now was of the impression which she had
produced on him? No. The one honorable course that he could take
was to find an excuse for withdrawing from his engagement. "Beg
her ladyship not to wait dinner for me," he said. "I will write
and make my apologies." The cab drove off. The wondering servant
waited on the doorstep, looking after it. "I wouldn't stand in
Mr. Julian's shoes for something," he thought, with his mind
running on the difficulties of the young clergyman's position.
"There she is along with him in the cab. What is he going to do
with her after that?"
<P>
Julian himself, if it had been put to him at the moment, could
not have answered the question.
<P>
--------
<P>
Lady Janet's anxiety was far from being relieved when Mercy had
been restored to her senses and conducted to her own room.
<P>
Mercy's mind remained in a condition of unreasoning alarm, which
it was impossible to remove. Over and over again she was told
that the woman who had terrified her had left the house, and
would never be permitted to enter it more; over and over again
she was assured that the stranger's frantic assertions were
regarded by everybody about her as unworthy of a moment's serious
attention. She persisted in doubting whether they were telling
her the truth. A shocking distrust of her friends seemed to
possess her. She shrunk when Lady Janet approached the bedside.
She shuddered when Lady Janet kissed her. She flatly refused to
let Horace see her. She asked the strangest questions about
Julian Gray, and shook her head suspiciously when they told her
that he was absent from the house. At intervals she hid her face
in the bedclothes and murmured to herself piteously, "Oh, what
shall I do? What shall I do?" At other times her one petition was
to be left alone. "I want nobody in my room"--that was her sullen
cry--"nobody in my room."
<P>
The evening advanced, and brought with it no change for the
better. Lady Janet, by the advice of Horace, sent for her own
medical adviser.
<P>
The doctor shook his head. The symptoms, he said, indicated a
serious shock to the nervous system. He wrote a sedative
prescription; and he gave (with a happy choice of language) some
sound and safe advice. It amounted briefly to this: "Take her
away, and try the sea-side." Lady Janet's customary energy acted
on the advice, without a moment's needless delay. She gave the
necessary directions for packing the trunks overnight, and
decided on leaving Mablethorpe Hous e with Mercy the next
morning.
<P>
Shortly after the doctor had taken his departure a letter from
Julian, addressed to Lady Janet, was delivered by private
messenger.
<P>
Beginning with the necessary apologies for the writer's absence,
the letter proceeded in these terms:
<P>
<P>
"Before I permitted my companion to see the lawyer, I felt the
necessity of consulting him as to my present position toward her
first.
<P>
"I told him--what I think it only right to repeat to you--that I
do not feel justified in acting on my own opinion that her mind
is deranged. In the case of this friendless woman I want medical
authority, and, more even than that, I want some positive proof,
to satisfy my conscience as well as to confirm my view.
<P>
"Finding me obstinate on this point, the lawyer undertook to
consult a physician accustomed to the treatment of the insane, on
my behalf.
<P>
"After sending a message and receiving the answer, he said,
'Bring the lady here--in half an hour; she shall tell her story
to the doctor instead of telling it to me.' The proposal rather
staggered me; I asked how it was possible to induce her to do
that. He laughed, and answered, 'I shall present the doctor as my
senior partner; my senior partner will be the very man to advise
her.' You know that I hate all deception, even where the end in
view appears to justify it. On this occasion, however, there was
no other alternative than to let the lawyer take his own course,
or to run the risk of a delay which might be followed by serious
results.
<P>
"I waited in a room by myself (feeling very uneasy, I own) until
the doctor joined me, after the interview was over.
<P>
"His opinion is, briefly, this:
<P>
"After careful examination of the unfortunate creature, he thinks
that there are unmistakably symptoms of mental aberration. But
how far the mischief has gone, and whether her case is, or is
not, sufficiently grave to render actual restraint necessary, he
cannot positively say, in our present state of ignorance as to
facts.
<P>
"'Thus far,' he observed, 'we know nothing of that part of her
delusion which relates to Mercy Merrick. The solution of the
difficulty, in this case, is to be found there. I entirely agree
with the lady that the inquiries of the consul at Mannheim are
far from being conclusive. Furnish me with satisfactory evidence
either that there is, or is not, such a person really in
existence as Mercy Merrick, and I will give you a positive
opinion on the case whenever you choose to ask for it.'
<P>
"Those words have decided me on starting for the Continent and
renewing the search for Mercy Merrick.
<P>
"My friend the lawyer wonders jocosely whether _I_ am in my right
senses. His advice is that I should apply to the nearest
magistrate, and relieve you and myself of all further trouble in
that way.
<P>
"Perhaps you agree with him? My dear aunt (as you have often
said), I do nothing like other people. I am interested in this
case. I cannot abandon a forlorn woman who has been confided to
me to the tender mercies of strangers, so long as there is any
hope of my making discoveries which may be instrumental in
restoring her to herself--perhaps, also, in restoring her to her
friends.
<P>
"I start by the mail-train of to-night. My plan is to go first to
Mannheim and consult with the consul and the hospital doctors;
then to find my way to the German surgeon and to question _him_;
and, that done, to make the last and hardest effort of all--the
effort to trace the French ambulance and to penetrate the mystery
of Mercy Merrick.
<P>
"Immediately on my return I will wait on you, and tell you what I
have accomplished, or how I have failed.
<P>
"In the meanwhile, pray be under no alarm about the reappearance
of this unhappy woman at your house. She is fully occupied in
writing (at my suggestion) to her friends in Canada; and she is
under the care of the landlady at her lodgings--an experienced
and trustworthy person, who has satisfied the doctor as well as
myself of her fitness for the charge that she has undertaken.
<P>
"Pray mention this to Miss Roseberry (whenever you think it
desirable), with the respectful expression of my sympathy, and of
my best wishes for her speedy restoration to health. And once
more forgive me for failing, under stress of necessity, to enjoy
the hospitality of Mablethorpe House."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Lady Janet closed Julian's letter, feeling far from satisfied
with it. She sat for a while, pondering over what her nephew had
written to her.
<P>
"One of two things," thought the quick-witted old lady. "Either
the lawyer is right, and Julian is a fit companion for the
madwoman whom he has taken under his charge, or he has some
second motive for this absurd journey of his which he has
carefully abstained from mentioning in his letter. What can the
motive be?"
<P>
At intervals during the night that question recurred to her
ladyship again and again. The utmost exercise of her ingenuity
failing to answer it, her one resource left was to wait patiently
for Julian's return, and, in her own favorite phrase, to "have it
out of him" then.
<P>
The next morning Lady Janet and her adopted daughter left
Mablethorpe House for Brighton; Horace (who had begged to be
allowed to accompany them) being sentenced to remain in London by
Mercy's express desire. Why--nobody could guess; and Mercy
refused to say.
