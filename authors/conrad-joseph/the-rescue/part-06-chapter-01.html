<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>"Have you got King Tom's watch in there?" said a voice that seemed
not to attach the slightest importance to the question. Jorgenson,
outside the door of Mrs. Travers' part of the deckhouse, waited
for the answer. He heard a low cry very much like a moan, the
startled sound of pain that may be sometimes heard in sick rooms.
But it moved him not at all. He would never have dreamt of opening
the door unless told to do so, in which case he would have beheld,
with complete indifference, Mrs. Travers extended on the floor
with her head resting on the edge of the camp bedstead (on which
Lingard had never slept), as though she had subsided there from
a kneeling posture which is the attitude of prayer, supplication,
or defeat. The hours of the night had passed Mrs. Travers by.
After flinging herself on her knees, she didn't know why, since
she could think of nothing to pray for, had nothing to invoke,
and was too far gone for such a futile thing as despair, she had
remained there till the sense of exhaustion had grown on her to
the point in which she lost her belief in her power to rise. In
a half-sitting attitude, her head resting against the edge of
the couch and her arms flung above her head, she sank into an
indifference, the mere resignation of a worn-out body and a worn-out
mind which often is the only sort of rest that comes to people
who are desperately ill and is welcome enough in a way. The voice
of Jorgenson roused her out of that state. She sat up, aching
in every limb and cold all over.</p>

<p>Jorgenson, behind the door, repeated with lifeless obstinacy:</p>

<p>"Do you see King Tom's watch in there?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers got up from the floor. She tottered, snatching at
the air, and found the back of the armchair under her hand.</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>She was also ready to ask: "Where am I?" but she remembered and
at once became the prey of that active dread which had been lying
dormant for a few hours in her uneasy and prostrate body. "What
time is it?" she faltered out.</p>

<p>"Dawn," pronounced the imperturbable voice at the door. It seemed
to her that it was a word that could make any heart sink with
apprehension. Dawn! She stood appalled. And the toneless voice
outside the door insisted:</p>

<p>"You must have Tom's watch there!"</p>

<p>"I haven't seen it," she cried as if tormented by a dream.</p>

<p>"Look in that desk thing. If you push open the shutter you will
be able to see."</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers became aware of the profound darkness of the cabin.
Jorgenson heard her staggering in there. After a moment a woman's
voice, which struck even him as strange, said in faint tones:</p>

<p>"I have it. It's stopped."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. I don't want to know the time. There should
be a key about. See it anywhere?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's fastened to the watch," the dazed voice answered from
within. Jorgenson waited before making his request. "Will you
pass it out to me? There's precious little time left now!"</p>

<p>The door flew open, which was certainly something Jorgenson had
not expected. He had expected but a hand with the watch protruded
through a narrow crack, But he didn't start back or give any other
sign of surprise at seeing Mrs. Travers fully dressed. Against
the faint clearness in the frame of the open shutter she presented
to him the dark silhouette of her shoulders surmounted by a sleek
head, because her hair was still in the two plaits. To Jorgenson
Mrs. Travers in her un-European dress had always been displeasing,
almost monstrous. Her stature, her gestures, her general carriage
struck his eye as absurdly incongruous with a Malay costume, too
ample, too free, too bold&mdash;offensive. To Mrs. Travers, Jorgenson,
in the dusk of the passage, had the aspect of a dim white ghost,
and he chilled her by his ghost's aloofness.</p>

<p>He picked up the watch from her outspread palm without a word
of thanks, only mumbling in his moustache, "H'm, yes, that's it.
I haven't yet forgotten how to count seconds correctly, but it's
better to have a watch."</p>

<p>She had not the slightest notion what he meant. And she did not
care. Her mind remained confused and the sense of bodily discomfort
oppressed her. She whispered, shamefacedly, "I believe I've slept."</p>

<p>"I haven't," mumbled Jorgenson, growing more and more distinct
to her eyes. The brightness of the short dawn increased rapidly
as if the sun were impatient to look upon the Settlement. "No
fear of that," he added, boastfully.</p>

<p>It occurred to Mrs. Travers that perhaps she had not slept either.
Her state had been more like an imperfect, half-conscious, quivering
death. She shuddered at the recollection.</p>

<p>"What an awful night," she murmured, drearily.</p>

<p>There was nothing to hope for from Jorgenson. She expected him
to vanish, indifferent, like a phantom of the dead carrying off
the appropriately dead watch in his hand for some unearthly purpose.
Jorgenson didn't move. His was an insensible, almost a senseless
presence! Nothing could be extorted from it. But a wave of anguish
as confused as all her other sensations swept Mrs. Travers off
her feet.</p>

<p>"Can't you tell me something?" she cried.</p>

<p>For half a minute perhaps Jorgenson made no sound; then: "For
years I have been telling anybody who cared to ask," he mumbled
in his moustache. "Telling Tom, too. And Tom knew what he wanted
to do. How's one to know what <em>you</em> are after?"</p>

<p>She had never expected to hear so many words from that rigid
shadow. Its monotonous mumble was fascinating, its sudden loquacity
was shocking. And in the profound stillness that reigned outside
it was as if there had been no one left in the world with her
but the phantom of that old adventurer. He was heard again: "What
I could tell you would be worse than poison."</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers was not familiar with Jorgenson's consecrated phrases.
The mechanical voice, the words themselves, his air of abstraction
appalled her. And he hadn't done yet; she caught some more of
his unconcerned mumbling: "There is nothing I don't know," and
the absurdity of the statement was also appalling. Mrs. Travers
gasped and with a wild little laugh:</p>

<p>"Then you know why I called after King Tom last night."</p>

<p>He glanced away along his shoulder through the door of the deckhouse
at the growing brightness of the day. She did so, too. It was
coming. It had come! Another day! And it seemed to Mrs. Travers
a worse calamity than any discovery she had made in her life,
than anything she could have imagined to come to her. The very
magnitude of horror steadied her, seemed to calm her agitation
as some kinds of fatal drugs do before they kill. She laid a steady
hand on Jorgenson's sleeve and spoke quietly, distinctly, urgently.</p>

<p>"You were on deck. What I want to know is whether I was heard?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jorgenson, absently, "I heard you." Then, as if roused
a little, he added less mechanically: "The whole ship heard you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers asked herself whether perchance she had not simply
screamed. It had never occurred to her before that perhaps she
had. At the time it seemed to her she had no strength for more
than a whisper. Had she been really so loud? And the deadly chill,
the night that had gone by her had left in her body, vanished
from her limbs, passed out of her in a flush. Her face was turned
away from the light, and that fact gave her courage to continue.
Moreover, the man before her was so detached from the shames and
prides and schemes of life that he seemed not to count at all,
except that somehow or other he managed at times to catch the
mere literal sense of the words addressed to him&mdash;and answer them.
And answer them! Answer unfailingly, impersonally, without any
feeling.</p>

<p>"You saw Tom &mdash;King Tom? Was he there? I mean just then,
at the moment. There was a light at the gangway. Was he on deck?"</p>

<p>"No. In the boat."</p>

<p>"Already? Could I have been heard in the boat down there? You
say the whole ship heard me&mdash;and I don't care. But could he hear
me?"</p>

<p>"Was it Tom you were after?" said Jorgenson in the tone of a
negligent remark.</p>

<p>"Can't you answer me?" she cried, angrily.</p>

<p>"Tom was busy. No child's play. The boat shoved off," said Jorgenson,
as if he were merely thinking aloud.</p>

<p>"You won't tell me, then?" Mrs. Travers apostrophized him, fearlessly.
She was not afraid of Jorgenson. Just then she was afraid of nothing
and nobody. And Jorgenson went on thinking aloud.</p>

<p>"I guess he will be kept busy from now on and so shall I."</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers seemed ready to take by the shoulders and shake
that dead-voiced spectre till it begged for mercy. But suddenly
her strong white arms fell down by her side, the arms of an exhausted
woman.</p>

<p>"I shall never, never find out," she whispered to herself.</p>

<p>She cast down her eyes in intolerable humiliation, in intolerable
desire, as though she had veiled her face. Not a sound reached
the loneliness of her thought. But when she raised her eyes again
Jorgenson was no longer standing before her.</p>

<p>For an instant she saw him all black in the brilliant and narrow
doorway, and the next moment he had vanished outside, as if devoured
by the hot blaze of light. The sun had risen on the Shore of Refuge.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Travers came out on deck herself it was as it were
with a boldly unveiled face, with wide-open and dry, sleepless
eyes. Their gaze, undismayed by the sunshine, sought the innermost
heart of things each day offered to the passion of her dread and
of her impatience. The lagoon, the beach, the colours and the
shapes struck her more than ever as a luminous painting on an
immense cloth hiding the movements of an inexplicable life. She
shaded her eyes with her hand. There were figures on the beach,
moving dark dots on the white semicircle bounded by the stockades,
backed by roof ridges above the palm groves. Further back the
mass of carved white coral on the roof of the mosque shone like
a white day-star. Religion and politics&mdash;always politics! To the
left, before Tengga's enclosure, the loom of fire had changed
into a pillar of smoke. But there were some big trees over there
and she couldn't tell whether the night council had prolonged
its sitting. Some vague forms were still moving there and she
could picture them to herself: Daman, the supreme chief of sea-robbers,
with a vengeful heart and the eyes of a gazelle; Sentot, the sour
fanatic with the big turban, that other saint with a scanty loin
cloth and ashes in his hair, and Tengga whom she could imagine
from hearsay, fat, good-tempered, crafty, but ready to spill blood
on his ambitious way and already bold enough to flaunt a yellow
state umbrella at the very gate of Belarab's stockade&mdash;so they
said.</p>

<p>She saw, she imagined, she even admitted now the reality of those
things no longer a mere pageant marshalled for her vision with
barbarous splendour and savage emphasis. She questioned it no
longer&mdash;but she did not feel it in her soul any more than one
feels the depth of the sea under its peaceful glitter or the turmoil
of its grey fury. Her eyes ranged afar, unbelieving and fearful&mdash;and
then all at once she became aware of the empty Cage with its interior
in disorder, the camp bedsteads not taken away, a pillow lying
on the deck, the dying flame like a shred of dull yellow stuff
inside the lamp left hanging over the table. The whole struck
her as squalid and as if already decayed, a flimsy and idle phantasy.
But Jorgenson, seated on the deck with his back to it, was not
idle. His occupation, too, seemed fantastic and so truly childish
that her heart sank at the man's utter absorption in it. Jorgenson
had before him, stretched on the deck, several bits of rather
thin and dirty-looking rope of different lengths from a couple
of inches to about a foot. He had (an idiot might have amused
himself in that way) set fire to the ends of them. They smouldered
with amazing energy, emitting now and then a splutter, and in
the calm air within the bulwarks sent up very slender, exactly
parallel threads of smoke, each with a vanishing curl at the end;
and the absorption with which Jorgenson gave himself up to that
pastime was enough to shake all confidence in his sanity.</p>

<p>In one half-opened hand he was holding the watch. He was also
provided with a scrap of paper and the stump of a pencil. Mrs.
Travers was confident that he did not either hear or see her.</p>

<p>"Captain Jorgenson, you no doubt think. . . ."</p>

<p>He tried to wave her away with the stump of the pencil. He did
not want to be interrupted in his strange occupation. He was playing
very gravely indeed with those bits of string. "I lighted them
all together," he murmured, keeping one eye on the dial of the
watch. Just then the shortest piece of string went out, utterly
consumed. Jorgenson made a hasty note and remained still while
Mrs. Travers looked at him with stony eyes thinking that nothing
in the world was any use. The other threads of smoke went on vanishing
in spirals before the attentive Jorgenson.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked Mrs. Travers, drearily.</p>

<p>"Timing match . . . precaution. . . ."</p>

<p>He had never in Mrs. Travers' experience been less spectral than
then. He displayed a weakness of the flesh. He was impatient at
her intrusion. He divided his attention between the threads of
smoke and the face of the watch with such interest that the sudden
reports of several guns breaking for the first time for days the
stillness of the lagoon and the illusion of the painted scene
failed to make him raise his head. He only jerked it sideways
a little. Mrs. Travers stared at the wisps of white vapour floating
above Belarab's stockade. The series of sharp detonations ceased
and their combined echoes came back over the lagoon like a long-drawn
and rushing sigh.</p>

<p>"What's this?" cried Mrs. Travers.</p>

<p>"Belarab's come home," said Jorgenson.</p>

<p>The last thread of smoke disappeared and Jorgenson got up. He
had lost all interest in the watch and thrust it carelessly into
his pocket, together with the bit of paper and the stump of pencil.
He had resumed his aloofness from the life of men, but approaching
the bulwark he condescended to look toward Belarab's stockade.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is home," he said very low.</p>

<p>"What's going to happen?" cried Mrs. Travers. "What's to be done?" 
Jorgenson kept up his appearance of communing with himself.</p>

<p>"I know what to do," he mumbled.</p>

<p>"You are lucky," said Mrs. Travers, with intense bitterness.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she was abandoned by all the world. The
opposite shore of the lagoon had resumed its aspect of a painted
scene that would never roll up to disclose the truth behind its
blinding and soulless splendour. It seemed to her that she had
said her last words to all of them: to d'Alcacer, to her husband,
to Lingard himself&mdash;and that they had all gone behind the curtain
forever out of her sight. Of all the white men Jorgenson alone
was left, that man who had done with life so completely that his
mere presence robbed it of all heat and mystery, leaving nothing
but its terrible, its revolting insignificance. And Mrs. Travers
was ready for revolt. She cried with suppressed passion:</p>

<p>"Are you aware, Captain Jorgenson, that I am alive?"</p>

<p>He turned his eyes on her, and for a moment she was daunted by
their cold glassiness. But before they could drive her away, something
like the gleam of a spark gave them an instant's animation.</p>

<p>"I want to go and join them. I want to go ashore," she said,
firmly. "There!"</p>

<p>Her bare and extended arm pointed across the lagoon, and Jorgenson's
resurrected eyes glided along the white limb and wandered off
into space.</p>

<p>"No boat," he muttered.</p>

<p>"There must be a canoe. I know there is a canoe. I want it."</p>

<p>She stepped forward compelling, commanding, trying to concentrate
in her glance all her will power, the sense of her own right to
dispose of herself and her claim to be served to the last moment
of her life. It was as if she had done nothing. Jorgenson didn't
flinch.</p>

<p>"Which of them are you after?" asked his blank, unringing voice.</p>

<p>She continued to look at him; her face had stiffened into a severe
mask; she managed to say distinctly:</p>

<p>"I suppose you have been asking yourself that question for some
time, Captain Jorgenson?"</p>

<p>"No. I am asking you now."</p>

<p>His face disclosed nothing to Mrs. Travers' bold and weary eyes.
"What could you do over there?" Jorgenson added as merciless,
as irrepressible, and sincere as though he were the embodiment
of that inner voice that speaks in all of us at times and, like
Jorgenson, is offensive and difficult to answer.</p>

<p>"Remember that I am not a shadow but a living woman still, Captain
Jorgenson. I can live and I can die. Send me over to share their
fate."</p>

<p>"Sure you would like?" asked the roused Jorgenson in a voice
that had an unexpected living quality, a faint vibration which
no man had known in it for years. "There may be death in it,"
he mumbled, relapsing into indifference.</p>

<p>"Who cares?" she said, recklessly. "All I want is to ask Tom
a question and hear his answer. That's what I would like. That's
what I must have."</p>
