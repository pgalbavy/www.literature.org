<p>After the guests had gone away to dress Portlaw looked inquiringly
at Malcourt and said: "That misdeal may have been a slip. I begin
to believe I was mistaken after all. What do you think, Louis?"</p>

<p>Malcourt's eyes wandered toward his wife who still bent low over
her sewing. "I don't think," he said absently, and sauntered over
to Shiela, saying:</p>

<p>"It's rather dull for you, isn't it?"</p>

<p>She made no reply until Portlaw had gone upstairs; then looking
around at him:</p>

<p>"Is there any necessity for me to sit here while you play cards
this evening?"</p>

<p>"No, if it doesn't amuse you."</p>

<p>Amuse her! She rested her elbow on the window ledge, and, chin
on hand, stared out into the gray world of rain&mdash;the world that
had been so terribly altered for her for ever. In the room shadows
were gathering; the dull light faded. Outside it rained over land
and water, over the encircling forest which walled in this stretch
of spectral world where the monotony of her days was spent.</p>

<p>To the sadness of it she was slowly becoming inured; but the
strangeness of her life she could not yet comprehend&mdash;its meaningless
days and nights, its dragging hours&mdash;and the strange people around
her immersed in their sordid pleasures&mdash;this woman&mdash;her husband's
sister, thin-lipped, hard-featured, drinking, smoking, gambling,
shrill in disputes, merciless of speech, venomously curious concerning
all that she held locked in the privacy of her wretchedness.</p>

<p>"Shiela," he said, "why don't you pay your family a visit?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You're afraid they might suspect that you are not particularly
happy?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... It was wrong to have Gray and Cecile here. It was fortunate
you were away. But they saw the Tressilvains."</p>

<p>"What did they think of 'em?" inquired Malcourt.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose they would think?"</p>

<p>"Quite right. Well, don't worry. Hold out a little longer. This
is a ghastly sort of pantomime for you, but there's always a grand
transformation scene at the end. Who knows how soon the curtain
will rise on fairyland and the happy lovers and all that bright
and sparkling business? Children demand it&mdash;must have it.... And
you are very young yet."</p>

<p>He laughed, seeing her perplexed expression.</p>

<p>"You don't know what I mean, do you? Listen, Shiela; stay here
to dinner, if you can stand my relatives. We won't play cards.
You'll really find it amusing I think."</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to stay?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I want you to see something."</p>

<p>A few moments afterward she took her umbrella and waterproof
and went away to dress, returning to a dinner-table remarkable
for the silence of the diners. Something, too, had gone wrong
with the electric plant, and after dinner candles were lighted
in the living-room. Outside it rained heavily.</p>

<p>Malcourt sat beside his wife, smoking, and, unaided, sustaining
what conversation there was; and after a while he rose, dragged
a heavy, solid wooden table to the middle of the room, placed
five chairs around it, and smilingly invited Shiela, the Tressilvains,
and Portlaw to join him.</p>

<p>"A seance in table-tipping?" asked his sister coldly. "Really,
Louis, I think we are rather past such things."</p>

<p>"I never saw a bally table tip," observed Tressilvain. "How do
you do it, Louis?"</p>

<p>"I don't; it tips. Come, Shiela, if you don't mind. Come on,
Billy."</p>

<p>Tressilvain seated himself and glanced furtively about him.</p>

<p>"I dare say you're all in this game," he said, with a rattling
laugh.</p>

<p>"It's no game. If the table tips it tips, and our combined weight
can't hold it down," said Malcourt. "If it won't tip it won't,
and I'll bet you a hundred dollars that you can't tip it, Herby."</p>

<p>Tressilvain, pressing his hands hard on the polished edge, tried
to move the table; then he stood up and tried. It was too heavy
and solid, and he could do nothing except by actually lifting
it or by seizing it in both hands and dragging it about.</p>

<p>One by one, reluctantly, the others took seats around the table
and, as instructed by Malcourt, rested the points of their fingers
on the dully polished surface.</p>

<p>"Does it really ever move?" asked Shiela of Malcourt.</p>

<p>"It sometimes does."</p>

<p>"What's the explanation?" demanded Portlaw, incredulously; "spirits?"</p>

<p>"I don't think anybody here would credit such an explanation,"
said Malcourt. "The table moves or it doesn't. If it does you'll
see it. I'll leave the explanation to you, William."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen it move?" asked Shiela, turning again to
Malcourt.</p>

<p>"Yes; so has my sister. It's not a trick." Lady Tressilvain looked
bored, but answered Shiela's inquiry:</p>

<p>"I've seen it often. Louis and I and my father used to do it.
I don't know how it's done, and nobody else does. Personally I
think it's rather a stupid way to spend an evening&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," interrupted Portlaw, "there'll be nothing stupid about
it if the table begins to tip up here under our very fingers.
I'll bet you, Louis, that it doesn't. Do you care to bet?"</p>

<p>"Shouldn't the lights be put out?" asked Tressilvain.</p>

<p>Malcourt said it was not necessary, and cautioned everybody to
sit absolutely clear of the table, and to rest only the tips of
the fingers very lightly on the surface.</p>

<p>"Can we speak?" grinned Portlaw.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, if you like." A bright colour glowed in Malcourt's
face; he looked down dreamily at the top of the table where his
hands touched. A sudden quiet fell over the company.</p>

<p>Shiela, sitting with her white fingers lightly brushing the smooth
mahogany, bent her head, mind wandering; and her thoughts were
very far away when, under her sensitive touch, a curious quiver
seemed to run through the very grain of the wood.</p>

<p>"What's that!" exclaimed Portlaw.</p>

<p>Deep in the wood, wave after wave of motion seemed to spread
until the fibres emitted a faint splintering sound. Then, suddenly,
the heavy table rose slowly, the end on which Shiela's hands rested
sinking; and fell back with a solid shock.</p>

<p>"That's&mdash;rather&mdash;odd!" muttered Tressilvain. Portlaw's distended
eyes were fastened on the table, which was now heaving uneasily
like a boat at anchor, creaking, cracking, rocking under their
finger-tips. Tressilvain rose from his chair and tried to see,
but as everybody was clear of the table, and their fingers barely
touched the top, he could discover no visible reason for what
was occurring so violently under his very pointed nose.</p>

<p>"It's like a bally earthquake," he said in amazement. "God bless
my soul! the thing is walking off with us!"</p>

<p>Everybody had risen from necessity; chairs were pushed back,
skirts drawn aside as the heavy table, staggering, lurching, moved
out across the floor; and they all followed, striving to keep
their finger-tips on the top.</p>

<p>Portlaw was speechless; Shiela pale, tremulous, bewildered; Tressilvain's
beady eyes shone like the eyes of a surprised rat; but his wife
and Malcourt took it calmly.</p>

<p>"The game is," said Malcourt, "to ask whether there is a spirit
present, and then recite the alphabet. Shall I?... It isn't frightening
you, is it, Shiela?"</p>

<p>"No.... But I don't understand why it moves."</p>

<p>"Neither does anybody. But you see it, feel it. Nor can anybody
explain why an absurd question and reciting the alphabet sometimes
results in a coherent message. Shall I try it, Helen?"</p>

<p>His sister nodded indifferently.</p>

<p>There was a silence, then Malcourt, still standing, said quietly:</p>

<p>"Is there a message?"</p>

<p>From the deep, woody centre of the table three loud knocks sounded&mdash;almost
ripped out, and the table quivered in every fibre.</p>

<p>"Is there a message for anybody present?"</p>

<p>Three raps followed in a startling volley.</p>

<p>"Get the chairs," motioned Malcourt; and when all were seated
clear of the table but touching lightly the surface with their
finger-tips:</p>

<p>"A B C D E F"&mdash;began Malcourt, slowly reciting the alphabet;
and, as the raps rang out, sig-nalling some letter, he began again
in a monotonous voice: "A B C D E F G"&mdash;pausing as soon as the
raps arrested him at a certain letter, only to begin again.</p>

<p>"Get a pad and pencil," whispered Lady Tressilvain to Shiela.</p>

<p>So Shiela left the table, found a pad and pencil, and seated
herself near a candle by the window; and as each letter was rapped
out by the table, she put it down in order.</p>

<p>The recitation seemed endless; Malcourt's voice grew hoarse with
the repetition; letter after letter was added to the apparently
meaningless sequence on Shiela's pad.</p>

<p>"Is there any sense in it so far?" asked Lady Tressilvain.</p>

<p>"I cannot find any," said Shiela, striving with her pencil point
to divide the string of letters into intelligible words.</p>

<p>And still Malcourt's monotonous voice droned on, and still the
raps sounded from the table. Portlaw hung over it as though hypnotized;
Tressilvain had fallen to moistening his lips with the tip of
his tongue, stealthy eyes always roaming about the candle-lit
room as though searching for something uncanny lurking in the
shadows.</p>

<p>Shiela shivered, wide-eyed, as she sat watching the table which
was now snapping and cracking and heaving under her gaze. A slow
fear of the thing crept over her&mdash;of this senseless, lifeless
mass of wood, fashioned by human hands. The people around it,
the room, the house were becoming horrible to her; she loathed
them and what they were doing.</p>

<p>A ripping crash brought her to her feet; everybody sprang up.
Under their hands the table was shuddering convulsively. Suddenly
it split open as though rent by a bolt, and fell like a live thing
in agony, a mass of twisted fibres protruding like viscera from
its shattered core.</p>

<p>Stunned silence; and Malcourt turned to his sister and spoke
in a low voice, but she only shook her head, shivering, and stared
at the wreck of wood as though revolted.</p>

<p>"W-what happened?" faltered Portlaw, bewildered.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Malcourt unsteadily.</p>

<p>"Don't know! Look at that table! Why, man, it's&mdash;it's <em>dying</em>!"</p>

<p>Tressilvain stood as though stupefied. Malcourt walked slowly
over to where Shiela stood.</p>

<p>She shrank involuntarily away from him as he bent to pick up
the pad which had fallen from her hands.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be frightened about," he said, forcing a
smile; and, holding the pad under the light, scanned it attentively.
His sister came over to him, asking if the letters made any sense.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>They studied it together, Shiela's fascinated gaze riveted on
them both. And she saw Lady Tressilvain's big eyes widen as she
laid her pencil on a sequence; saw Malcourt's quick nod of surprised
comprehension when she checked off a word, then another, another,
another; and suddenly her face turned white to the lips, and she
caught at her brother's arm, terrified.</p>

<p>"Will you keep quiet?" he whispered fiercely, snatching the sheet
from the pad and crumpling it into his palm.</p>

<p>Sister and brother faced each other; in his eyes leaped a flame
infernal which seemed to hold her paralyzed for a moment; then,
with a gesture, she swept him aside, and covering her eyes with
her hands, sank into a chair.</p>

<p>"What a fool you are!" he said furiously, bending down beside
her. "It's in us both; you'll do it, too, when you are ready&mdash;if
you have any sporting blood in you!"</p>

<p>And, straightening up impatiently, his eyes fell on Shiela, and
he shrugged his shoulders and smiled resignedly.</p>

<p>"It's nothing. My sister's nerves are a bit upset.... After all,
this parlour magic is a stupid mistake, because there's always
somebody who takes it seriously. It's only humbug, anyway; you
know that, don't you, Shiela?"</p>

<p>He untwisted the paper in his hand and held it in the candle
flame until it burned to cinders.</p>

<p>"What was there on that paper?" asked Shiela, managing to control
her voice.</p>

<p>"Why, merely a suggestion that I travel," he said coolly. "I
can't see why my sister should make a fool of herself over the
idea of my going on a journey. I've meant to, for years&mdash;to rest
myself. I've told you that often, haven't I, Shiela?"</p>

<p>She nodded slowly, but her eyes reverted to the woman crouching
in the chair, face buried in her brilliantly jewelled hands. Portlaw
and Tressilvain were also staring at her.</p>

<p>"You'd better go to bed, Helen," said Malcourt coolly; and turned
on his heel, lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>A little later the Tressilvains and Shiela started across the
lawn to their own apartments, and Malcourt went with them to hold
an umbrella over his wife.</p>

<p>In the lower hall they separated with scarcely a word, but Malcourt
detained his brother-in-law by a significant touch on the arm,
and drew him into the library.</p>

<p>"So you're leaving to-morrow?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What?" said Tressilvain.</p>

<p>"I say that I understand you and Helen are leaving us to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I had not thought of leaving," said Tressilvain.</p>

<p>"Think again," suggested Malcourt.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Malcourt walked up very close and looked him in the face.</p>

<p>"Must I explain?" he asked contemptuously. "I will if you like&mdash;you
clumsy card-slipping, ace-pricking blackguard!... The station-wagon
will be ready at seven. See that you are, too. Now go and tell
my sister. It may reconcile her to various ideas of mine."</p>

<p>And he turned and, walking to a leather-covered chair drawn up
beside the library table, seated himself and opened a heavy book.</p>

<p>Tressilvain stood absolutely still, his close-set eyes fairly
starting from his face, in which not a vestige of colour now remained;
and when at length he left the room he left so noiselessly that
Malcourt did not hear him. However, Malcourt happened to be very
intent upon his own train of thought, so absorbed, in fact, that
it was a long while before he looked up and around, as though
somebody had suddenly spoken his name.</p>

<p>But it was only the voice which had sounded so often and familiarly
in his ears; and he smiled and inclined his graceful head to listen,
folding his hands under his chin.</p>

<p>He seemed very young and boyish, there, leaning both elbows on
the library table, head bent expectantly as he listened, or lifted
when he, in turn, spoke aloud. And sometimes he spoke gravely,
argumentatively, sometimes almost flippantly, and once or twice
his laugh rang out through the empty room.</p>

<p>In the forest a heavy wind had risen; somewhere outside a door
or shutter banged persistently. He did not hear it, but Shiela,
sleepless in her room above, laid down Hamil's book; then, thinking
it might be the outer door left carelessly unlocked, descended
the stairs with lighted candle. Passing the library and hearing
voices she halted, astonished to see her husband there alone;
and as she stood, perplexed and disturbed, he spoke as though
answering a question. But there was no one there who could have
asked it; the room was empty save for that solitary figure. Something
in his voice terrified her&mdash;in the uncanny monologue which meant
nothing to her&mdash;in his curiously altered laugh&mdash;in his intent
listening attitude. It was not the first time she had seen him
this way.</p>

<p>"Louis!" she exclaimed; "what are you doing?"</p>

<p>He turned dreamily toward her, rose as in a trance.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it you?... Come in here."</p>

<p>"I cannot; I am tired."</p>

<p>"So am I, Shiela&mdash;tired to death. What time is it?"</p>

<p>"After ten, I think&mdash;if that clock is right."</p>

<p>She entered, reluctant, uncertain, peering up at the clock; then:</p>

<p>"I thought the front door had been left open and came down to
lock it. What are you doing here at this hour? I &mdash;I thought
I heard you talking."</p>

<p>"I was talking to my father."</p>

<p>"What!" she said, startled.</p>

<p>"Pretending to," he added wearily; "sit down."</p>

<p>"Do you wish me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; sit down."</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;" </em>she looked fearfully at him, hesitated, and slowly
seated herself on the arm of a lounge. "W-what is it you&mdash;want,
Louis?" she faltered, every nerve on edge.</p>

<p>"Nothing much; a kindly word or two."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Have I ever been unkind? I &mdash;I am too
unhappy to be unkind to anybody." Suddenly her eyes filled.</p>

<p>"Don't do that," he said; "you are always civil to me&mdash;never
unkind. By the way, my relatives leave to-morrow. That will comfort
you, won't it?"</p>

<p>She said nothing.</p>

<p>He leaned heavily on the table, dark face framed in both hands:</p>

<p>"Shiela, when a man is really tired, don't you think it reasonable
for him to take a rest&mdash;and give others one?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"A rather protracted rest is good for tired people, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In fact," with a whimsical smile, "a sort of endlessly eternal
rest ought to cure anybody. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>She stared at him.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to remember that my father, needing a good long
rest, took a sudden vacation to enjoy it?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>don't know what you mean!"&mdash;tremulously.</p>

<p>"You remember how he started on that restful vacation which he
is still enjoying?"</p>

<p>A shudder ran over her. She strove to speak, but her voice died
in her throat.</p>

<p>"My father," he said dreamily, "seems to want me to join him
during his vacation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Louis!"</p>

<p>"What are you frightened about? It's as good a vacation as any
other&mdash;only one takes no luggage and pays no hotel bills.... Haven't
you any sense of humour left in you, Shiela? I'm not serious."</p>

<p>She said, trembling, and very white: "I thought you meant it."
Then she rose with a shiver, turned, and mounted the stairs to
her room again. But in the stillness of the place something was
already at work on her&mdash;fear&mdash;a slow dawning alarm at the silence,
the loneliness, the forests, the rain&mdash;a growing horror of the
place, of the people in it, of this man the world called her husband,
of his listening silences, his solitary laughter, his words spoken
to something unseen in empty rooms, his awful humour.</p>

<p>Her very knees were shaking under her now; she stared around
her like a trapped thing, desperate, feeling that self-control
was going in sudden, ungovernable panic.</p>

<p>Scarcely knowing what she was about she crept to the telephone
and, leaning heavily against the wall, placed the receiver to
her ear.</p>

<p>For a long while she waited, dreading lest the operator had gone.
Then a far voice hailed her; she gave the name; waited interminable
minutes until a servant's sleepy voice requested her to hold the
wire. And, at last:</p>

<p>"Is it you?"</p>

<p>"No, not ill. It's only that I am so horribly alone here in the
rain. I &mdash;I cannot seem to endure it." She was speaking almost
incoherently, now, scarcely conscious of what she was saying.
"There's a man downstairs who talks in empty rooms and listens
to things I cannot hear&mdash;listens every day, I tell you; I've seen
him often, often &mdash;I mean Louis Malcourt! And I cannot endure

<p>She hung up the receiver, turned, and flung open the window.</p>

<p>Over the wet woods a rain-washed moon glittered; the long storm
had passed.</p>

<p>An hour later, as she kneeled by the open window, her chin on
her arms, watching for him, out of the shadow and into the full
moonlight galloped a rider who drew bridle on the distant lawn,
waving her a gay gesture of reassurance.</p>

<p>It was too far for her to call; she dared not descend fearing
the dogs might wake the house.</p>

<p>And in answer to his confident salute, she lighted a candle,
and, against the darkness, drew the fiery outline of a heart;
then extinguishing the light, she sank back in her big chair,
watching him as he settled in his stirrups for the night-long
vigil that she meant to share with him till dawn.</p>

<p>The whole night long once more together! She thrilled at the
thought of it&mdash;at the memory of that other night and dawn under
the Southern planets where a ghostly ocean thundered at their
feet&mdash;where her awakened heart quickened with the fear of him&mdash;and
all her body trembled with the blessed fear of him, and every
breath was delicious with terror of the man who had come this
night to guard her.</p>

<p>Partly undressed, head cradled in her tumbled hair, she lay there
in the darkness watching him&mdash;her paladin on guard beneath the
argent splendour of the moon. Under the loosened silken vest her
heart was racing; under the unbound hair her cheeks were burning.
The soft lake breeze rippled the woodbine leaves along the sill,
stirring the lace and ribbon on her breast.</p>

<p>Hour after hour she lay there, watching him through the dreamy
lustre of the moon, all the mystery of her love for him tremulous
within her. Once, on the edge of sleep, yet still awake, she stretched
her arms toward him in the darkness, unconsciously as she did
in dreams.</p>

<p>Slowly the unreality of it all was enveloping her, possessed
her as her lids grew heavy. In the dim silvery light she could
scarcely see him now: a frail mist belted horse and rider, stretching
fairy barriers across the lawn. Suddenly, within her, clear, distinct,
a voice began calling to him imperiously; but her lips never moved.
Yet she knew he would hear; surely he heard! Surely, surely!&mdash;for
was he not already drifting toward her through the moonlight,
nearer, here under the palms and orange-trees&mdash;here at her feet,
holding her close, safe, strong, till, faint with the happiness
of dreams come true, she slept, circled by his splendid arms.</p>

<p>And, while she lay there, lips scarce parted, sleeping quietly
as a tired child, he sat his mud-splashed saddle, motionless under
the moon, eyes never leaving her window for an instant, till at
last the far dawn broke and the ghostly shadows fled away.</p>

<p>Then, in the pallid light, he slowly gathered bridle and rode
back into the Southern forest, head heavy on his breast.</p>
