A JACKDAW, seeing some Doves in a cote abundantly provided with
food, painted himself white and joined them in order to share
their plentiful maintenance.  The Doves, as long as he was
silent, supposed him to be one of themselves and admitted him to
their cote.  But when one day he forgot himself and began to
chatter, they discovered his true character and drove him forth,
pecking him with their beaks.  Failing to obtain food among the
Doves, he returned to the Jackdaws.  They too, not recognizing
him on account of his color.  expelled him from living with them. 
So desiring two ends, he obtained neither.
