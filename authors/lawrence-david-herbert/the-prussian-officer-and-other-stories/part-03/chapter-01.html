<p>Mr Lindley was first vicar of Aldecross.  The cottages of this tiny
hamlet had nestled in peace since their beginning, and the country
folk had crossed the lanes and farm-lands, two or three miles, to
the parish church at Greymeed, on the bright Sunday mornings.</p>

<p>But when the pits were sunk, blank rows of dwellings started up
beside the high roads, and a new population, skimmed from the
floating scum of workmen, was filled in, the cottages and the
country people almost obliterated.</p>

<p>To suit the convenience of these new collier-inhabitants, a church
must be built at Aldecross.  There was not too much money.  And so
the little building crouched like a humped stone-and-mortar mouse,
with two little turrets at the west corners for ears, in the fields
near the cottages and the apple trees, as far as possible from the
dwellings down the high road.  It had an uncertain, timid look
about it.  And so they planted big-leaved ivy, to hide its
shrinking newness.  So that now the little church stands buried in
its greenery, stranded and sleeping among the fields, while the
brick houses elbow nearer and nearer, threatening to crush it down.
It is already obsolete.</p>

<p>The Reverend Ernest Lindley, aged twenty-seven, and newly married,
came from his curacy in Suffolk to take charge of his church.  He
was just an ordinary young man, who had been to Cambridge and taken
orders.  His wife was a self-assured young woman, daughter of a
Cambridgeshire rector.  Her father had spent the whole of his
thousand a year, so that Mrs Lindley had nothing of her own.  Thus
the young married people came to Aldecross to live on a stipend of
about a hundred and twenty pounds, and to keep up a superior
position.</p>

<p>They were not very well received by the new, raw, disaffected
population of colliers.  Being accustomed to farm labourers, Mr
Lindley had considered himself as belonging indisputably to the
upper or ordering classes.  He had to be humble to the county
families, but still, he was of their kind, whilst the common people
were something different.  He had no doubts of himself.</p>

<p>He found, however, that the collier population refused to accept
this arrangement.  They had no use for him in their lives, and they
told him so, callously.  The women merely said, &quot;they were throng,&quot;
or else, &quot;Oh, it's no good you coming here, we're Chapel.&quot;  The men
were quite good-humoured so long as he did not touch them too nigh,
they were cheerfully contemptuous of him, with a preconceived
contempt he was powerless against.</p>

<p>At last, passing from indignation to silent resentment, even, if he
dared have acknowledged it, to conscious hatred of the majority of
his flock, and unconscious hatred of himself, he confined his
activities to a narrow round of cottages, and he had to submit.  He
had no particular character, having always depended on his position
in society to give him position among men.  Now he was so poor, he
had no social standing even among the common vulgar tradespeople of
the district, and he had not the nature nor the wish to make his
society agreeable to them, nor the strength to impose himself where
he would have liked to be recognized.  He dragged on, pale and
miserable and neutral.</p>

<p>At first his wife raged with mortification.  She took on airs and
used a high hand.  But her income was too small, the wrestling with
tradesmen's bills was too pitiful, she only met with general,
callous ridicule when she tried to be impressive.</p>

<p>Wounded to the quick of her pride, she found herself isolated in an
indifferent, callous population.  She raged indoors and out.  But
soon she learned that she must pay too heavily for her outdoor
rages, and then she only raged within the walls of the rectory.
There her feeling was so strong, that she frightened herself.  She
saw herself hating her husband, and she knew that, unless she were
careful, she would smash her form of life and bring catastrophe
upon him and upon herself.  So in very fear, she went quiet.  She
hid, bitter and beaten by fear, behind the only shelter she had in
the world, her gloomy, poor parsonage.</p>

<p>Children were born one every year; almost mechanically, she
continued to perform her maternal duty, which was forced upon her.
Gradually, broken by the suppressing of her violent anger and
misery and disgust, she became an invalid and took to her couch.</p>

<p>The children grew up healthy, but unwarmed and rather rigid.  Their
father and mother educated them at home, made them very proud and
very genteel, put them definitely and cruelly in the upper classes,
apart from the vulgar around them.  So they lived quite isolated.
They were good-looking, and had that curiously clean, semi-
transparent look of the genteel, isolated poor.</p>

<p>Gradually Mr and Mrs Lindley lost all hold on life, and spent their
hours, weeks and years merely haggling to make ends meet, and
bitterly repressing and pruning their children into gentility,
urging them to ambition, weighting them with duty.  On Sunday
morning the whole family, except the mother, went down the lane to
church, the long-legged girls in skimpy frocks, the boys in black
coats and long, grey, unfitting trousers.  They passed by their
father's parishioners with mute, clear faces, childish mouths
closed in pride that was like a doom to them, and childish eyes
already unseeing.  Miss Mary, the eldest, was the leader.  She was
a long, slim thing with a fine profile and a proud, pure look of
submission to a high fate.  Miss Louisa, the second, was short and
plump and obstinate-looking.  She had more enemies than ideals.
She looked after the lesser children, Miss Mary after the elder.
The collier children watched this pale, distinguished procession of
the vicar's family pass mutely by, and they were impressed by the
air of gentility and distance, they made mock of the trousers of
the small sons, they felt inferior in themselves, and hate stirred
their hearts.</p>

<p>In her time, Miss Mary received as governess a few little daughters
of tradesmen; Miss Louisa managed the house and went among her
father's church-goers, giving lessons on the piano to the colliers'
daughters at thirteen shillings for twenty-six lessons.</p>
