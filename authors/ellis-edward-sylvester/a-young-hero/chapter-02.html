<p>Fred Sheldon, as I have said, is the hero of this story.</p>

<p>He was twelve years of age, the picture of rosy health, good
nature, bounding spirits and mental strength. He was bright and
well advanced in his studies, and as is generally the case with
such vigorous youngsters he was fond of fun, which too often,
perhaps, passed the line of propriety and became mischief.</p>

<p>On the Monday morning after the fight, which Fred Sheldon interrupted,
some ten or twelve boys stopped on their way to the Tottenville
Public School to admire in open-mouthed wonder, the gorgeous pictures
pasted on a huge framework of boards, put up for the sole purpose
of making such a display.</p>

<p>These flaming posters were devoted to setting forth the unparalleled
attractions of Bandman's great menagerie and circus, which was
announced to appear in the well-known "Hart's Half-Acre," near
the village of Tottenville.</p>

<p>These scenes, in which elephants, tigers, leopards, camels, sacred
cows, and indeed an almost endless array of animals were shown
on a scale that indicated they were as high as a meeting-house,
in which the serpents, it unwound from the trees where they were
crushing men and beasts to death, would have stretched across
"Hart's Half-Acre" (which really contained several acres), those
frightful encounters, in which a man, single-handed, was seen
to be spreading death and destruction with a clubbed gun among
the fierce denizens of the forest; all these had been displayed
on the side of barns and covered bridges, at the cross-roads,
and indeed in every possible available space for the past three
weeks; and, as the date of the great show was the one succeeding
that of which we are speaking, it can be understood that the little
village of Tottenville and the surrounding country were in a state
of excitement such as had not been known since the advent of the
preceding circus.</p>

<p>Regularly every day the school children had stopped in front
of the huge bill-board and studied and admired and talked over
the great show, while those who expected to go in the afternoon
or evening looked down in pity on their less fortunate playmates.</p>

<p>The interest seemed to intensify as the day approached, and,
now that it was so close at hand, the little group found it hard
to tear themselves away from the fascinating scenes before them.</p>

<p>Down in one corner of the board was the picture of a hyena desecrating
a cemetery, as it is well known those animals are fond of doing.
This bad creature, naturally enough, became very distasteful to
the boys, who showed their ill-will in many ways.</p>

<p>Several almost ruined their new shoes by kicking him, while others
had pelted him with stones, and still others, in face of the warning
printed in big letters, had haggled him dreadfully with their
jack-knives.</p>

<p>It was a warm summer morning and most of the boys not only were
bare-footed, but had their trousers rolled above their knees,
and, generally, were without coat or vest.</p>

<p>"To-morrow afternoon the show will be here," said Sammy McClay,
smacking his lips and shaking his head as though he tasted a luscious
morsel, "and I'm going."</p>

<p>"How are you going," asked Joe Hunt, sarcastically, "when your
father said he wouldn't give you the money?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind," was the answer, with another significant shake
of the head. "I'm goin'&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"Goin' to try and crawl under the tent. I know. But you can't
do it. You'll get a whack from the whip of the man that's watching
that you'll feel for six weeks. Don't I know&mdash;'cause, didn't I
try it?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be such a dunce as you; you got half way under the
tent and then stuck fast, so you couldn't go backward or forward,
and you begun to yell so you like to broke up the performance,
and when the man come along why he had the best chance in the
world to cowhide you, and he did it. I think I know a little better
than that."</p>

<p>At this moment, Mr. Abijah McCurtis, the school teacher in the
little stone school-house a hundred yards away, solemnly lifted
his spectacles from his nose to his forehead, and grasping the
handle of his large cracked bell walked to the door and swayed
it vigorously for a minute or so.</p>

<p>This was the regular summons for the boys and girls to enter
school, and he had sent forth the unmusical clangor, summer and
winter, for a full two-score years.</p>

<p>Having called the pupils together, the pedagogue sat down, drew
his spectacles back astride of his nose, and resumed setting copies
in the books which had been laid on his desk the day before.</p>

<p>In a minute or so the boys and girls came straggling in, but
the experienced eye of the teacher saw that several were missing.</p>

<p>Looking through the open door he discovered where the four delinquent
urchins were; they were still standing in front of the great showy
placards, studying the enchanting pictures, as they had done so
many times before.</p>

<p>They were all talking earnestly, Sammy McClay, Joe Hunt, Jimmy
Emery and Fred Sheldon, and they had failed for the first time
in their lives to hear the cracked bell.</p>

<p>Most teachers, we are bound to believe, would have called the
boys a second time or sent another lad to notify them, but the
present chance was one of those which, unfortunately, the old-time
pedagogue was glad to have, and Mr. McCurtis seized it with pleasure.</p>

<p>Rising from his seat, he picked up from where it lay across his
desk a long, thin switch, and started toward the four barefooted
lads, who were admiring the circus pictures.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more inviting, for, not only were they
barefooted, but each had his trousers rolled to the knee, and
Fred Sheldon had drawn and squeezed his so far that they could
go no further. His plump, clean legs offered the most inviting
temptation to the teacher, who was one of those sour old pedagogues,
of the long ago, who delighted in seeing children tortured under
the guise of so-called discipline.</p>

<p>"I don't believe in wearing trousers in warm weather," said Fred,
when anybody looked wonderingly to see whether he really had such
useful garments on, "and that's why I roll mine so high up. Don't
you see I'm ready to run into the water, and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"How about going through the bushes and briars?" asked Joe Hunt.</p>

<p>"I don't go through 'em," was the crushing answer. "I feel so
supple and limber that I just jump right over the top. I tell
you, boys, that you ought to see me jump&#11834;"</p>

<p>Fred's wish was gratified, for at that moment he gave such an
exhibition of jumping as none of his companions had ever seen
before. With a shout he sprang high in air, kicking out his bare
legs in a frantic way, and ran with might and main for the school-house.</p>

<p>The other three lads did pretty much the same, for the appearance
of the teacher among them was made known by the whizzing hiss
of his long, slender switch, which first landed on Fred's legs,
and was then quickly transferred to the lower limbs of the other
boys, the little company immediately heading for the school house,
with Fred Sheldon at the front.</p>

<p>Each one shouted, and made a high and frantic leap every few
steps, believing that the teacher was close behind him with upraised
stick, and looking for the chance to bring it down with effect.</p>

<p>"I'll teach you not to stand gaping at those pictures," shouted
Mr. McCurtis, striding wrathfully after them.</p>

<p>A man three-score years old cannot be expected to be as active
as a boy with one-fifth as many years; but the teacher had the
advantage of being very tall and quite attenuated, and for a short
distance he could outrun any of his pupils.</p>

<p>The plump, shapely legs of Fred Sheldon, twinkling and doubling
under him as he ran, seemed to be irresistibly tempting to Mr.
McCurtis, who, with upraised switch, dashed for him like a thunder-gust,
paying no attention to the others, who ducked aside as he passed.</p>

<p>"It's your fault, you young scapegrace," called out the pursuer,
as he rapidly overhauled him; "you haven't been thinking of anything
else but circuses for the past month and I mean to whip it out
of you&mdash;good gracious sakes!"</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon had seen how rapidly the teacher was gaining, and
finding there was no escape, resorted to the common trick among
boys of suddenly falling flat on his face while running at full
speed.</p>

<p>The cruel-hearted teacher at that very moment made a savage stroke,
intending to raise a ridge on the flesh of the lad, who escaped
it by a hair's breadth, as may be said.</p>

<p>The spiteful blow spent itself in vacancy, and the momentum spun
Mr. McCurtis around on one foot, so that he faced the other way.
At that instant his heels struck the prostrate form of the crouching
boy, and he went over, landing upon his back, his legs pointing
upward, like a pair of huge dividers.</p>

<p>There is nothing a boy perceives so quickly as a chance for fun,
and before the teacher could rise, Sammy McClay also went tumbling
over the grinning Fred Sheldon, with such violence, indeed, that
he struck the bewildered instructor as he was trying to adjust
his spectacles to see where he was.</p>

<p>Then came Joe Hunt and Jimmy Emery, and Fred Sheldon capped the
climax by running at full speed and jumping on the struggling
group, spreading out his arms and legs in the effort to bear them
down to the earth.</p>

<p>But the difficulty was that Fred was not very heavy nor bony,
so that his presence on top caused very little inconvenience,
the teacher rising so hurriedly that Fred fell from his shoulders,
and landed on his head when he struck the earth.</p>

<p>The latter was dented, but Fred wasn't hurt at all, and he and
his friends scrambled hastily into the school-house, where the
other children were in an uproar, fairly dancing with delight
at the exhibition, or rather "circus," as some of them called
it, which took place before the school-house and without any expense
to them.</p>

<p>By the time the discomfited teacher had got upon his feet and
shaken himself together, the four lads were in school, busily
engaged in scratching their legs and studying their lessons.</p>

<p>Mr. McCurtis strode in a minute later switch in hand, and in
such a grim mood that he could only quiet his nerves by walking
around the room and whipping every boy in it.</p>
