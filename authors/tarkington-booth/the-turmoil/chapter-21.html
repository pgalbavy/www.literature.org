<p>And so Bibbs sat in the porch of the temple with the money-changers.
But no one came to scourge him forth, for this was the temple
of Bigness, and the changing of money was holy worship and true
religion. The priests wore that "settish" look Bibbs's mother
had seen beginning to develop about his mouth and eyes&mdash;a wary
look which she could not define, but it comes with service at
the temple; and it was the more marked upon Bibbs for his sharp
awakening to the necessities of that service.</p>

<p>He did as little "useless" thinking as possible, giving himself
no time for it. He worked continuously, keeping his thoughts still
on his work when he came home at night; and he talked of nothing
whatever except his work. But he did not sing at it. He was often
in the streets, and people were not allowed to sing in the streets.
They might make any manner of hideous uproar&mdash;they could shake
buildings; they could out-thunder the thunder, deafen the deaf,
and kill the sick with noise; or they could walk the streets or
drive through them bawling, squawking, or screeching, as they
chose, if the noise was traceably connected with business; though
street musicians were not tolerated, being considered a nuisance
and an interference. A man or woman who went singing for pleasure
through the streets&mdash;like a crazy Neopolitan&mdash;would have been
stopped, and belike locked up; for Freedom does not mean that
a citizen is allowed to do every outrageous thing that comes into
his head. The streets were dangerous enough, in all conscience,
without any singing! and the Motor Federation issued public warnings
declaring that the pedestrian's life was in his own hands, and
giving directions how to proceed with the least peril. However,
Bibbs Sheridan had no desire to sing in the streets, or anywhere.
He had gone to his work with an energy that, for the start, at
least, was bitter, and there was no song left in him.</p>

<p>He began to know his active fellow-citizens. Here and there among
them he found a leisurely, kind soul, a relic of the old period
of neighborliness, "pioneer stock," usually; and there were men&mdash;particularly
among the merchants and manufacturers&mdash;"so honest they leaned
backward"; reputations sometimes attested by stories of heroic
sacrifices to honor; nor were there lacking some instances of
generosity even nobler. Here and there, too, were book-men, in
their little leisure; and, among the Germans, music-men. And these,
with the others, worshiped Bigness and the growth, each man serving
for his own sake and for what he could get out of it, but all
united in their faith in the beneficence and glory of their god.</p>

<p>To almost all alike that service stood as the most important
thing in life, except on occasion of some such vital, brief interregnum
as the dangerous illness of a wife or child. In the way of "relaxation"
some of the servers took golf; some took fishing; some took "shows"&mdash;a
mixture of infantile and negroid humor, stockings, and tin music;
some took an occasional debauch; some took trips; some took cards;
and some took nothing. The high priests were vigilant to watch
that no "relaxation"  should affect the service. When a man attended
to anything outside his business, eyes were upon him; his credit
was in danger&mdash;that is, his life was in danger. And the old priests
were as ardent as the young ones; the million was as eager to
be bigger as the thousand; seventy was as busy as seventeen. They
strove mightily against one another, and the old priests were
the most wary, the most plausible, and the most dangerous. Bibbs
learned he must walk charily among these&mdash;he must wear a thousand
eyes and beware of spiders indeed!</p>

<p>And outside the temple itself were the pretenders, the swarming
thieves and sharpers and fleecers, the sly rascals and the open
rascals; but these were feeble folk, not dangerous once he knew
them, and he had a good guide to point them out to him. They were
useful sometimes, he learned, and many of them served as go-betweens
in matters where business must touch politics. He learned also
how breweries and "traction" companies and banks and other institutions
fought one another for the political control of the city. The
newspapers, he discovered, had lost their ancient political influence,
especially with the knowing, who looked upon them with a skeptical
humor, believing the journals either to be retained partisans,
like lawyers, or else striving to forward the personal ambitions
of their owners. The control of the city lay not with them, but
was usually obtained by giving the hordes of negroes gin-money,
and by other largesses. The revenues of the people were then distributed
as fairly as possible among a great number of men who had assisted
the winning side. Names and titles of offices went with many of
the prizes, and most of these title-holders were expected to present
a busy appearance at times; and, indeed, some among them did work
honestly and faithfully.</p>

<p>Bibbs had been very ignorant. All these simple things, so well
known and customary, astonished him at first, and once&mdash;in a brief
moment of forgetting that he was done with writing&mdash;he thought
that if he had known them and written of them, how like a satire
the plainest relation of them must have seemed! Strangest of all
to him was the vehement and sincere patriotism. On every side
he heard it&mdash;it was a permeation; the newest school-child caught
it, though just from Hungary and learning to stammer a few words
of the local language. Everywhere the people shouted of the power,
the size, the riches, and the growth of their city. Not only that,
they said that the people of their city were the greatest, the
"finest," the strongest, the Biggest people on earth. They cited
no authorities, and felt the need of none, being themselves the
people thus celebrated. And if the thing was questioned, or if
it was hinted that there might be one small virtue in which they
were not perfect and supreme, they wasted no time examining themselves
to see if what the critic said was true, but fell upon him and
hooted him and cursed him, for they were sensitive. So Bibbs,
learning their ways and walking with them, harkened to the voice
of the people and served Bigness with them. For the voice of the
people is the voice of their god.</p>

<p>Sheridan had made the room next to his own into an office for
Bibbs, and the door between the two rooms usually stood open&mdash;the
father had established that intimacy. One morning in February,
when Bibbs was alone, Sheridan came in, some sheets of typewritten
memoranda in his hand.</p>

<p>"Bibbs," he said, "I don't like to butt in very often this way,
and when I do I usually wish I hadn't&mdash;but for Heaven's sake what
have you been buying that ole busted inter-traction stock for?"</p>

<p>Bibbs leaned back from his desk. "For eleven hundred and fifty-five
dollars. That's all it cost."</p>

<p>"Well, it ain't worth eleven hundred and fifty-five cents. You
ought to know that. I don't get your idea. That stuff's deader'n
Adam's cat!"</p>

<p>"It might be worth something&mdash;some day."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"It mightn't be so dead&mdash;not if we went into it," said Bibbs,
coolly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Sheridan considered this musingly; then he said, "Who'd
you buy it from?"</p>

<p>"A broker &mdash;Fansmith."</p>

<p>"Well, he must 'a' got it from one o' the crowd o' poor ninnies
that was soaked with it. Don't you know who owned it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Ain't sayin', though? That it? What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"It belonged to Mr. Vertrees," said Bibbs, shortly, applying
himself to his desk.</p>

<p>"So!" Sheridan gazed down at his son's thin face. "Excuse me,"
he said. "Your business." And he went back to his own room. But
presently he looked in again.</p>

<p>"I reckon you won't mind lunchin' alone to-day"&mdash;he was shuffling
himself into his overcoat&mdash;"because I just thought I'd go up to
the house and get <em>THIS </em>over with mamma." He glanced apologetically
toward his right hand as it emerged from the sleeve of the overcoat.
The bandages had been removed, finally, that morning, revealing
but three fingers&mdash;the forefinger and the finger next to it had
been amputated. "She's bound to make an awful fuss, and better
to spoil her lunch than her dinner. I'll be back about two."</p>

<p>But he calculated the time of his arrival at the New House so
accurately that Mrs. Sheridan's lunch was not disturbed, and she
was rising from the lonely table when he came into the dining-room.
He had left his overcoat in the hall, but he kept his hands in
his trousers pockets.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, papa?" she asked, quickly. "Has anything
gone wrong? You ain't sick?"</p>

<p>"Me!" He laughed loudly. "Me <em>SICK</em>?"</p>

<p>"You had lunch?"</p>

<p>"Didn't want any to-day. You can give me a cup o' coffee, though."</p>

<p>She rang, and told George to have coffee made, and when he had
withdrawn she said querulously, "I just know there's something
wrong."</p>

<p>"Nothin' in the world," he responded, heartily, taking a seat
at the head of the table. "I thought I'd talk over a notion o'
mine with you, that's all. It's more women-folks' business than
what it is man's, anyhow."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"Why, ole Doc Gurney was up at the office this morning awhile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To look at your hand? How's he say it's doin'?"</p>

<p>"Fine! Well, he went in and sat around with Bibbs awhile&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheridan nodded pessimistically. "I guess it's time you
had him, too. I <em>KNEW </em>Bibbs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, mamma, hold your horses! I wanted him to look Bibbs over
<em>BEFORE </em>anything's the matter. You don't suppose I'm goin'
to take any chances with <em>BIBBS, </em>do you? Well, afterwards,
I shut the door, and I an' ole Gurney had a talk. He's a mighty
disagreeable man; he rubbed it in on me what he said about Bibbs
havin' brains if he ever woke up. Then I thought he must want
to get something out o' me, he go so flattering&mdash;for a minute!
'Bibbs couldn't help havin' business brains,' he says, 'bein'
<em>YOUR </em>son. Don't be surprised,' he says&mdash;'don't be surprised
at his makin' a success,' he says. 'He couldn't get over his heredity;
he couldn't <em>HELP </em>bein' a business success&mdash;once you got
him into it. It's in his blood. Yes, sir' he says, 'it doesn't
need <em>MUCH </em>brains,' he says, 'an only third-rate brains,
at that,' he says, 'but it does need a special <em>KIND </em>o'
brains,' he says, 'to be a millionaire. I mean,' he says, 'when
a man's given a start. If nobody gives him a start, why, course
he's got to have luck <em>AND </em>the right kind o' brains. The
only miracle about Bibbs,' he says, 'is where he got the <em>OTHER
</em>kind o' brains&mdash;the brains you made him quit usin' and throw
away.'"</p>

<p>"But what'd he say about his health?" Mrs. Sheridan demanded,
impatiently, as George placed a cup of coffee before her husband.
Sheridan helped himself to cream and sugar, and began to sip the
coffee.</p>

<p>"I'm comin' to that," he returned, placidly. "See how easy I
manage this cup with my left hand, mamma?"</p>

<p>"You been doin' that all winter. What did&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's wonderful," he interrupted, admiringly, "what a fellow
can do with his left hand. I can sign my name with mine now, well's
I ever could with my right. It came a little hard at first, but
now, honest, I believe I <em>RATHER </em>sign with my left. That's
all I ever have to write, anyway&mdash;just the signature. Rest's all
dictatin'." He blew across the top of the cup unctuously. "Good
coffee, mamma! Well, about Bibbs. Ole Gurney says he believes
if Bibbs could somehow get back to the state o' mind he was in
about the machine-shop&mdash;that is, if he could some way get to feelin'
about business the way he felt about the shop&mdash;not the poetry
and writin' part, but&mdash;" He paused, supplementing his remarks
with a motion of his head toward the old house next door. "He
says Bibbs is older and harder'n what he was when he broke down
that time, and besides, he ain't the kind o' dreamy way he was
then&mdash;and I should say he <em>AIN'T! I'</em>d like 'em to show
ME anybody his age that's any wider awake! But he says Bibbs's
health never need bother us again if&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheridan shook her head. "I don't see any help <em>THAT
</em>way. You know yourself she wouldn't have Jim."</p>

<p>"Who's talkin' about her havin' anybody? But, my Lord! she might
let him <em>LOOK </em>at her! She needn't 'a' got so mad, just
because he asked her, that she won't let him come in the house
any more. He's a mighty funny boy, and some ways I reckon he's
pretty near as hard to understand as the Bible, but Gurney kind
o' got me in the way o' thinkin' that if she'd let him come back
and set around with her an evening or two sometimes&mdash;not reg'lar,
I don't mean&mdash;why &mdash;Well, I just thought I'd see what <em>YOU'D
</em>think of it. There ain't any way to talk about it to Bibbs
himself &mdash;I don't suppose he'd let you, anyhow&mdash;but I thought
maybe you could kind o' slip over there some day, and sort o'
fix up to have a little talk with her, and kind o' hint around
till you see how the land lays, and ask her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"ME!" Mrs. Sheridan looked both helpless and frightened. "No."
She shook her head decidedly. "It wouldn't do any good."</p>

<p>"You won't try it?"</p>

<p>"I won't risk her turnin' me out o' the house. Some way, that's
what I believe she did to Sibyl, from what Roscoe said once. No,
I <em>CAN'T&mdash;</em>and, what's more, it'd only make things worse.
If people find out you're runnin' after 'em they think you're
cheap, and then they won't do as much for you as if you let 'em
alone. I don't believe it's any use, and I couldn't do it if it
was."</p>

<p>He sighed with resignation. "All right, mamma. That's all." Then,
in a livelier tone, he said: "Ole Gurney took the bandages off
my hand this morning. All healed up. Says I don't need 'em any
more."</p>

<p>"Why, that's splendid, papa!" she cried, beaming. "I was afraid
&mdash;Let's see."</p>

<p>She came toward him, but he rose, still keeping his hand in his
pocket. "Wait a minute," he said, smiling. "Now it may give you
just a teeny bit of a shock, but the fact is&mdash;well, you remember
that Sunday when Sibyl came over here and made all that fuss about
nothin'&mdash;it was the day after I got tired o' that statue when
Edith's telegram came&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me see your hand!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Now wait!" he said, laughing and pushing her away with his left
hand. "The truth is, mamma, that I kind o' slipped out on you
that morning, when you wasn't lookin', and went down to ole Gurney's
office&mdash;he'd told me to, you see&mdash;and, well, it doesn't <em>AMOUNT
</em>to anything." And he held out, for her inspection, the mutilated
hand. "You see, these days when it's all dictatin', anyhow, nobody'd
mind just a couple o'&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had to jump for her&mdash;she went over backward. For the second
time in her life Mrs. Sheridan fainted.</p>

e voice. And as Mrs. Sheridan
started another record, a sudden, vital resolve leaped like fire
in the eyes of Sibyl. She walked down the hall and straight into
the smoking-room.</p>

<p>Lamhorn and Edith both sprang to their feet, separating. Edith
became instantly deathly white with a rage that set her shaking
from head to foot, and Lamhorn stuttered as he tried to speak.</p>

<p>But Edith's shaking was not so violent as Sibyl's, nor was her
face so white. At sight of them and of their embrace, all possible
consequences became nothing to Sibyl. She courtesied, holding
up her skirts and contorting her lips to the semblance of a smile.</p>

<p>"Sit just as you were&mdash;both of you!" she said. And then to Edith:
"Did you tell my husband I had been telephoning to Lamhorn?"</p>

<p>"You march out of here!" said Edith, fiercely. "March straight
out of here!"</p>

<p>Sibyl leveled a forefinger at Lamhorn.</p>

<p>"Did you tell her I'd been telephoning you I wanted you to come?"</p>

<p>"Oh, good God!" Lamhorn said. "Hush!"</p>

<p>"You knew she'd tell my husband, <em>DIDN'T </em>you?" she cried.
"You knew that!"</p>

<p>"<em>HUSH!" </em>he begged, panic-stricken.</p>

<p>"That was a <em>MANLY </em>thing to do! Oh, it was like a gentleman!
You wouldn't come&mdash;you wouldn't even come for five minutes to
hear what I had to say! You were <em>TIRED </em>of what I had
to say! You'd heard it all a thousand times before, and you wouldn't
come! No! No! NO!" she stormed. "You wouldn't even come for five
minutes, but you could tell that little cat! And <em>SHE </em>told
my husband! You're a <em>MAN</em>!"</p>

<p>Edith saw in a flash that the consequences of battle would be
ruinous to Sibyl, and the furious girl needed no further temptation
to give way to her feelings. "Get out of this house!" she shrieked.
"This is my father's house. Don't you dare speak to Robert like
that!"</p>

<p>"No! No! I mustn't <em>SPEAK</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you <em>DARE</em>!"</p>

<p>Edith and Sibyl began to scream insults at each other simultaneously,
fronting each other, their furious faces close. Their voices shrilled
and rose and cracked&mdash;they screeched. They could be heard over
the noise of the phonograph, which was playing a brass-band selection.
They could be heard all over the house. They were heard in the
kitchen; they could have been heard in the cellar. Neither of
them cared for that.</p>

<p>"You told my husband!" screamed Sibyl, bringing her face still
closer to Edith's. "You told my husband! This man put <em>THAT
</em>in your hands to strike me with! HE did!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell your husband again! I'll tell him everything I know!
It's <em>TIME </em>your husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>They were swept asunder by a bandaged hand. "Do you want the
neighbors in?" Sheridan thundered.</p>

<p>There fell a shocking silence. Frenzied Sibyl saw her husband
and his mother in the doorway, and she understood what she had
done. She moved slowly toward the door; then suddenly she began
to run. She ran into the hall, and through it, and out of the
house. Roscoe followed her heavily, his eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>"<em>NOW THEN!" </em>said Sheridan to Lamhorn.</p>

<p>The words were indefinite, but the voice was not. Neither was
the vicious gesture of the bandaged hand, which concluded its
orbit in the direction of the door in a manner sufficient for
the swift dispersal of George and Jackson and several female servants
who hovered behind Mrs. Sheridan. They fled lightly.</p>

<p>"Papa, papa!" wailed Mrs. Sheridan. "Look at your hand! You'd
oughtn't to been so rough with Edie; you hurt your hand on her
shoulder. Look!"</p>

<p>There was, in fact, a spreading red stain upon the bandages at
the tips of the fingers, and Sheridan put his hand back in the
sling. "Now then!"  he repeated. "You goin' to leave my house?"</p>

<p>"He will <em>NOT!" </em>sobbed Edith. "Don't you <em>DARE </em>order
him out!"</p>

<p>"Don't you bother, dear," said Lamhorn, quietly. "He doesn't
understand. <em>YOU </em>mustn't be troubled." Pallor was becoming
to him; he looked very handsome, and as he left the room he seemed
in the girl's distraught eyes a persecuted noble, indifferent
to the rabble yawping insult at his heels&mdash;the rabble being enacted
by her father.</p>

<p>"Don't come back, either!" said, Sheridan, realistic in this
impersonation. "Keep off the premises!" he called savagely into
the hall. "This family's through with you!"</p>

<p>"It is <em>NOT!" </em>Edith cried, breaking from her mother.
"You'll <em>SEE </em>about that! You'll find out! You'll find
out what'll happen! What's HE done? I guess if I can stand it,
it's none of <em>YOUR </em>business, is it? What's HE done, I'd
like to know? You don't know anything about it. Don't you s'pose
he told ME? She was crazy about him soon as he began going there,
and he flirted with her a little. That's everything he did, and
it was before he met ME! After that he wouldn't, and it wasn't
anything, anyway&mdash;he never was serious a minute about it. <em>SHE
</em>wanted it to be serious, and she was bound she wouldn't give
him up. He told her long ago he cared about me, but she kept persecuting
him and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sheridan, sternly; "that's <em>HIS </em>side of it!
That'll do! He doesn't come in this house again!"</p>

<p>"You look out!" Edith cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll look out! I'd 'a' told you to-day he wasn't to be
allowed on the premises, but I had other things on my mind. I
had Abercrombie look up this young man privately, and he's no
'count. He's no 'count on earth! He's no good! He's <em>NOTHIN'!
</em>But it wouldn't matter if he was George Washington, after
what's happened and what I've heard to-night!"</p>

<p>"But, papa," Mrs. Sheridan began, "if Edie says it was all Sibyl's
fault, makin' up to him, and he never encouraged her much, nor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'S enough!" he roared. "He keeps off these premises! And if
any of you so much as ever speak his name to me again&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Edith screamed, clapping her hands over her ears to shut
out the sound of his voice, and ran up-stairs, sobbing loudly,
followed by her mother. However, Mrs. Sheridan descended a few
minutes later and joined her husband in the library. Bibbs, still
sitting in his gold chair, saw her pass, roused himself from reverie,
and strolled in after her.</p>

<p>"She locked her door," said Mrs. Sheridan, shaking her head woefully.
"She wouldn't even answer me. They wasn't a sound from her room."</p>

<p>"Well," said her husband, "she can settle her mind to it. She
never speaks to that fellow again, and if he tries to telephone
her to-morrow &mdash;Here! You tell the help if he calls up to
ring off and say it's my orders. No, you needn't. I'll tell 'em
myself."</p>

<p>"Better not," said Bibbs, gently.</p>

<p>His father glared at him.</p>

<p>"It's no good," said Bibbs. "Mother, when you were in love with
father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My goodness!" she cried. "You ain't a-goin' to compare your
father to that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Edith feels about him just what you did about father," said
Bibbs. "And if <em>YOUR </em>father had told you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't <em>LISTEN </em>to such silly talk!" she declared, angrily.</p>

<p>"So you're handin' out your advice, are you, Bibbs?" said Sheridan.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Let her see him all she wants."</p>

<p>"You're a&mdash;" Sheridan gave it up. "I don't know what to call
you!"</p>

<p>"Let her see him all she wants," Bibbs repeated, thoughtfully.
"You're up against something too strong for you. If Edith were
a weakling you'd have a chance this way, but she isn't. She's
got a lot of your determination, father, and with what's going
on inside of her she'll beat you. You can't keep her from seeing
him, as long as she feels about him the way she does now. You
can't make her think less of him, either. Nobody can. Your only
chance is that she'll do it for herself, and if you give her time
and go easy she probably will. Marriage would do it for her quickest,
but that's just what you don't want, and as you <em>DON'T </em>want
it, you'd better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't stand any more!" Sheridan burst out. "If it's come to
<em>BIBBS </em>advisin' me how to run this house I better resign.
Mamma, where's that nigger George? Maybe HE'S got some plan how
I better manage my family. Bibbs, for God's sake go and lay down!
'Let her see him all she wants'! Oh, Lord! here's wisdom; here's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bibbs," said Mrs. Sheridan, "if you haven't got anything to
do, you might step over and take Sibyl's wraps home&mdash;she left
'em in the hall. I don't think you seem to quiet your poor father
very much just now."</p>

<p>"All right." And Bibbs bore Sibyl's wraps across the street and
delivered them to Roscoe, who met him at the door. Bibbs said
only, "Forgot these," and, "Good night, Roscoe," cordially and
cheerfully, and returned to the New House. His mother and father
were still talking in the library, but with discretion he passed
rapidly on and upward to his own room, and there he proceeded
to write in his note-book.</p>
