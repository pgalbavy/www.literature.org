<p>"Yes! Cat, dog, anything that can scratch or bite; as long as
it is harmful enough and mangy enough. A sick tiger would make
you happy&mdash;of all things. A half-dead tiger that you could weep
over and palm upon some poor devil in your power, to tend and
nurse for you. Never mind the consequences&mdash;to the poor devil.
Let him be mangled or eaten up, of course! You haven’t any pity
to spare for the victims of your infernal charity. Not you! Your
tender heart bleeds only for what is poisonous and deadly. I curse
the day when you set your benevolent eyes on him. I curse it .
. ."</p>

<p>"Now then! Now then!" growled Lingard in his moustache. Almayer,
who had talked himself up to the choking point, drew a long breath
and went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes! It has been always so. Always. As far back as I can remember.
Don’t you recollect? What about that half-starved dog you brought
on board in Bankok in your arms. In your arms by . . . ! It went
mad next day and bit the serang. You don’t mean to say you have
forgotten? The best serang you ever had! You said so yourself
while you were helping us to lash him down to the chain-cable,
just before he died in his fits. Now, didn’t you? Two wives and
ever so many children the man left. That was your doing. . . .
And when you went out of your way and risked your ship to rescue
some Chinamen from a water-logged junk in Formosa Straits, that
was also a clever piece of business. Wasn’t it? Those damned Chinamen
rose on you before forty-eight hours. They were cut-throats, those
poor fishermen. You knew they were cut-throats before you made
up your mind to run down on a lee shore in a gale of wind to save
them. A mad trick! If they hadn’t been scoundrels&mdash;hopeless scoundrels&mdash;you
would not have put your ship in jeopardy for them, I know. You
would not have risked the lives of your crew&mdash;that crew you loved
so&mdash;and your own life. Wasn’t that foolish! And, besides, you
were not honest. Suppose you had been drowned? I would have been
in a pretty mess then, left alone here with that adopted daughter
of yours. Your duty was to myself first. I married that girl because
you promised to make my fortune. You know you did! And then three
months afterwards you go and do that mad trick&mdash;for a lot of Chinamen
too. Chinamen! You have no morality. I might have been ruined
for the sake of those murderous scoundrels that, after all, had
to be driven overboard after killing ever so many of your crew&mdash;of
your beloved crew! Do you call that honest?"</p>

<p>"Well, well!" muttered Lingard, chewing nervously the stump of
his cheroot that had gone out and looking at Almayer&mdash;who stamped
wildly about the verandah&mdash;much as a shepherd might look at a
pet sheep in his obedient flock turning unexpectedly upon him
in enraged revolt. He seemed disconcerted, contemptuously angry
yet somewhat amused; and also a little hurt as if at some bitter
jest at his own expense. Almayer stopped suddenly, and crossing
his arms on his breast, bent his body forward and went on speaking.</p>

<p>"I might have been left then in an awkward hole&mdash;all on account
of your absurd disregard for your safety&mdash;yet I bore no grudge.
I knew your weaknesses. But now&mdash;when I think of it! Now we are
ruined. Ruined! Ruined! My poor little Nina. Ruined!"</p>

<p>He slapped his thighs smartly, walked with small steps this way
and that, seized a chair, planted it with a bang before Lingard,
and sat down staring at the old seaman with haggard eyes. Lingard,
returning his stare steadily, dived slowly into various pockets,
fished out at last a box of matches and proceeded to light his
cheroot carefully, rolling it round and round between his lips,
without taking his gaze for a moment off the distressed Almayer.
Then from behind a cloud of tobacco smoke he said calmly&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you had been in trouble as often as I have, my boy, you wouldn’t
carry on so. I have been ruined more than once. Well, here I am."</p>

<p>"Yes, here you are," interrupted Almayer. "Much good it is to
me. Had you been here a month ago it would have been of some use.
But now! . . You might as well be a thousand miles off."</p>

<p>"You scold like a drunken fish-wife," said Lingard, serenely.
He got up and moved slowly to the front rail of the verandah.
The floor shook and the whole house vibrated under his heavy step.
For a moment he stood with his back to Almayer, looking out on
the river and forest of the east bank, then turned round and gazed
mildly down upon him.</p>

<p>"It’s very lonely this morning here. Hey?" he said.</p>

<p>Almayer lifted up his head.</p>

<p>"Ah! you notice it&mdash;don’t you? I should think it is lonely! Yes,
Captain Lingard, your day is over in Sambir. Only a month ago
this verandah would have been full of people coming to greet you.
Fellows would be coming up those steps grinning and salaaming&mdash;to
you and to me. But our day is over. And not by my fault either.
You can’t say that. It’s all the doing of that pet rascal of yours.
Ah! He is a beauty! You should have seen him leading that hellish
crowd. You would have been proud of your old favourite."</p>

<p>"Smart fellow that," muttered Lingard, thoughtfully. Almayer
jumped up with a shriek.</p>

<p>"And that’s all you have to say! Smart fellow! O Lord!"</p>

<p>"Don’t make a show of yourself. Sit down. Let’s talk quietly.
I want to know all about it. So he led?"</p>

<p>"He was the soul of the whole thing. He piloted Abdulla’s ship
in. He ordered everything and everybody," said Almayer, who sat
down again, with a resigned air.</p>

<p>"When did it happen&mdash;exactly?"</p>

<p>"On the sixteenth I heard the first rumours of Abdulla’s ship
being in the river; a thing I refused to believe at first. Next
day I could not doubt any more. There was a great council held
openly in Lakamba’s place where almost everybody in Sambir attended.
On the eighteenth the Lord of the Isles was anchored in Sambir
reach, abreast of my house. Let’s see. Six weeks to-day, exactly."</p>

<p>"And all that happened like this? All of a sudden. You never
heard anything&mdash;no warning. Nothing. Never had an idea that something
was up? Come, Almayer!"</p>

<p>"Heard! Yes, I used to hear something every day. Mostly lies.
Is there anything else in Sambir?"</p>

<p>"You might not have believed them," observed Lingard. "In fact
you ought not to have believed everything that was told to you,
as if you had been a green hand on his first voyage."</p>

<p>Almayer moved in his chair uneasily.</p>

<p>"That scoundrel came here one day," he said. "He had been away
from the house for a couple of months living with that woman.
I only heard about him now and then from Patalolo’s people when
they came over. Well one day, about noon, he appeared in this
courtyard, as if he had been jerked up from hell-where he belongs."</p>

<p>Lingard took his cheroot out, and, with his mouth full of white
smoke that oozed out through his parted lips, listened, attentive.
After a short pause Almayer went on, looking at the floor moodily&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must say he looked awful. Had a bad bout of the ague probably.
The left shore is very unhealthy. Strange that only the breadth
of the river . . ."</p>

<p>He dropped off into deep thoughtfulness as if he had forgotten
his grievances in a bitter meditation upon the unsanitary condition
of the virgin forests on the left bank. Lingard took this opportunity
to expel the smoke in a mighty expiration and threw the stump
of his cheroot over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said, after a while. "He came to see you . . ."</p>

<p>"But it wasn’t unhealthy enough to finish him, worse luck!" went
on Almayer, rousing himself, "and, as I said, he turned up here
with his brazen impudence. He bullied me, he threatened vaguely.
He wanted to scare me, to blackmail me. Me! And, by heaven&mdash;he
said you would approve. You! Can you conceive such impudence?
I couldn’t exactly make out what he was driving at. Had I known,
I would have approved him. Yes! With a bang on the head. But how
could I guess that he knew enough to pilot a ship through the
entrance you always said was so difficult. And, after all, that
was the only danger. I could deal with anybody here&mdash;but when
Abdulla came. . . . That barque of his is armed. He carries twelve
brass six-pounders, and about thirty men. Desperate beggars. Sumatra
men, from Deli and Acheen. Fight all day and ask for more in the
evening. That kind."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," said Lingard, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Of course, then, they were cheeky as much as you please after
he anchored abreast of our jetty. Willems brought her up himself
in the best berth. I could see him from this verandah standing
forward, together with the half-caste master. And that woman was
there too. Close to him. I heard they took her on board off Lakamba’s
place. Willems said he would not go higher without her. Stormed
and raged. Frightened them, I believe. Abdulla had to interfere.
She came off alone in a canoe, and no sooner on deck than she
fell at his feet before all hands, embraced his knees, wept, raved,
begged his pardon. Why? I wonder. Everybody in Sambir is talking
of it. They never heard tell or saw anything like it. I have all
this from Ali, who goes about in the settlement and brings me
the news. I had better know what is going on&mdash;hadn’t I? From what
I can make out, they&mdash;he and that woman&mdash;are looked upon as something
mysterious&mdash;beyond comprehension. Some think them mad. They live
alone with an old woman in a house outside Lakamba’s campong and
are greatly respected&mdash;or feared, I should say rather. At least,
he is. He is very violent. She knows nobody, sees nobody, will
speak to nobody but him. Never leaves him for a moment. It’s the
talk of the place. There are other rumours. From what I hear I
suspect that Lakamba and Abdulla are tired of him. There’s also
talk of him going away in the Lord of the Isles&mdash;when she leaves
here for the southward&mdash;as a kind of Abdulla’s agent. At any rate,
he must take the ship out. The half-caste is not equal to it as
yet."</p>

<p>Lingard, who had listened absorbed till then, began now to walk
with measured steps. Almayer ceased talking and followed him with
his eyes as he paced up and down with a quarter-deck swing, tormenting
and twisting his long white beard, his face perplexed and thoughtful.</p>

<p>"So he came to you first of all, did he?" asked Lingard, without
stopping.</p>

<p>"Yes. I told you so. He did come. Came to extort money, goods
&mdash;I don’t know what else. Wanted to set up as a trader&mdash;the
swine! I kicked his hat into the courtyard, and he went after
it, and that was the last of him till he showed up with Abdulla.
How could I know that he could do harm in that way? Or in any
way at that! Any local rising I could put down easy with my own
men and with Patalolo’s help."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes. Patalolo. No good. Eh? Did you try him at all?"</p>

<p>"Didn’t I!" exclaimed Almayer. "I went to see him myself on the
twelfth. That was four days before Abdulla entered the river.
In fact, same day Willems tried to get at me. I did feel a little
uneasy then. Patalolo assured me that there was no human being
that did not love me in Sambir. Looked as wise as an owl. Told
me not to listen to the lies of wicked people from down the river.
He was alluding to that man Bulangi, who lives up the sea reach,
and who had sent me word that a strange ship was anchored outside&mdash;which,
of course, I repeated to Patalolo. He would not believe. Kept
on mumbling ‘No! No! No!’ like an old parrot, his head all of
a tremble, all beslobbered with betel-nut juice. I thought there
was something queer about him. Seemed so restless, and as if in
a hurry to get rid of me. Well. Next day that one-eyed malefactor
who lives with Lakamba&mdash;what’s his name &mdash;Babalatchi, put
in an appearance here! Came about mid-day, casually like, and
stood there on this verandah chatting about one thing and another.
Asking when I expected you, and so on. Then, incidentally, he
mentioned that they&mdash;his master and himself&mdash;were very much bothered
by a ferocious white man&mdash;my friend&mdash;who was hanging about that
woman &mdash;Omar’s daughter. Asked my advice. Very deferential
and proper. I told him the white man was not my friend, and that
they had better kick him out. Whereupon he went away salaaming,
and protesting his friendship and his master’s goodwill. Of course
I know now the infernal nigger came to spy and to talk over some
of my men. Anyway, eight were missing at the evening muster. Then
I took alarm. Did not dare to leave my house unguarded. You know
what my wife is, don’t you? And I did not care to take the child
with me&mdash;it being late&mdash;so I sent a message to Patalolo to say
that we ought to consult; that there were rumours and uneasiness
in the settlement. Do you know what answer I got?"</p>

<p>Lingard stopped short in his walk before Almayer, who went on,
after an impressive pause, with growing animation.</p>

<p>"All brought it: ‘The Rajah sends a friend’s greeting, and does
not understand the message.’ That was all. Not a word more could
Ali get out of him. I could see that Ali was pretty well scared.
He hung about, arranging my hammock&mdash;one thing and another. Then
just before going away he mentioned that the water-gate of the
Rajah’s place was heavily barred, but that he could see only very
few men about the courtyard. Finally he said, ‘There is darkness
in our Rajah’s house, but no sleep. Only darkness and fear and
the wailing of women.’ Cheerful, wasn’t it? It made me feel cold
down my back somehow. After Ali slipped away I stood here&mdash;by
this table, and listened to the shouting and drumming in the settlement.
Racket enough for twenty weddings. It was a little past midnight
then."</p>

<p>Again Almayer stopped in his narrative with an abrupt shutting
of lips, as if he had said all that there was to tell, and Lingard
stood staring at him, pensive and silent. A big bluebottle fly
flew in recklessly into the cool verandah, and darted with loud
buzzing between the two men. Lingard struck at it with his hat.
The fly swerved, and Almayer dodged his head out of the way. Then
Lingard aimed another ineffectual blow; Almayer jumped up and
waved his arms about. The fly buzzed desperately, and the vibration
of minute wings sounded in the peace of the early morning like
a far-off string orchestra accompanying the hollow, determined
stamping of the two men, who, with heads thrown back and arms
gyrating on high, or again bending low with infuriated lunges,
were intent upon killing the intruder. But suddenly the buzz died
out in a thin thrill away in the open space of the courtyard,
leaving Lingard and Almayer standing face to face in the fresh
silence of the young day, looking very puzzled and idle, their
arms hanging uselessly by their sides&mdash;like men disheartened by
some portentous failure.</p>

<p>"Look at that!" muttered Lingard. "Got away after all."</p>

<p>"Nuisance," said Almayer in the same tone. "Riverside is overrun
with them. This house is badly placed . . . mosquitos . . . and
these big flies . . . . last week stung Nina . . . been ill four
days . . . poor child. . . . I wonder what such damned things
are made for!"</p>
