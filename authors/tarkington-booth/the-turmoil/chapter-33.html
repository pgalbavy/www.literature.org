<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>There was a heavy town-fog that afternoon, a smoke-mist, densest
in the sanctuary of the temple. The people went about in it, busy
and dirty, thickening their outside and inside linings of coal-tar,
asphalt, sulphurous acid, oil of vitriol, and the other familiar
things the men liked to breathe and to have upon their skins and
garments and upon their wives and babies and sweethearts. The
growth of the city was visible in the smoke and the noise and
the rush. There was more smoke than there had been this day of
February a year earlier; there was more noise; and the crowds
were thicker&mdash;yet quicker in spite of that. The traffic policeman
had a hard time, for the people were independent&mdash;they retained
some habits of the old market-town period, and would cross the
street anywhere and anyhow, which not only got them killed more
frequently than if they clung to the legal crossings, but kept
the motormen, the chauffeurs, and the truck-drivers in a stew
of profane nervousness. So the traffic policemen led harried lives;
they themselves were killed, of course, with a certain periodicity,
but their main trouble was that they could not make the citizens
realize that it was actually and mortally perilous to go about
their city. It was strange, for there were probably no citizens
of any length of residence who had not personally known either
some one who had been killed or injured in an accident, or some
one who had accidentally killed or injured others. And yet, perhaps
it was not strange, seeing the sharp preoccupation of the faces&mdash;the
people had something on their minds; they could not stop to bother
about dirt and danger.</p>

<p>Mary Vertrees was not often down-town; she had never seen an
accident until this afternoon. She had come upon errands for her
mother connected with a timorous refurbishment; and as she did
these, in and out of the department stores, she had an insistent
consciousness of the Sheridan Building. From the street, anywhere,
it was almost always in sight, like some monstrous geometrical
shadow, murk-colored and rising limitlessly into the swimming
heights of the smoke-mist. It was gaunt and grimy and repellent;
it had nothing but strength and size&mdash;but in that consciousness
of Mary's the great structure may have partaken of beauty. Sheridan
had made some of the things he said emphatic enough to remain
with her. She went over and over them&mdash;and they began to seem
true: "Only <em>ONE </em>girl he could feel <em>THAT </em>sorry
for!" "Gurney says he's got you on his brain so bad&mdash;" The man's
clumsy talk began to sing in her heart. The song was begun there
when she saw the accident.</p>

<p>She was directly opposite the Sheridan Building then, waiting
for the traffic to thin before she crossed, though other people
were risking the passage, darting and halting and dodging parlously.
Two men came from the crowd behind her, talking earnestly, and
started across. Both wore black; one was tall and broad and thick,
and the other was taller, but noticeably slender. And Mary caught
her breath, for they were Bibbs and his father. They did not see
her, and she caught a phrase in Bibbs's mellow voice, which had
taken a crisper ring: "Sixty-eight thousand dollars? Not sixty-eight
thousand buttons!" It startled her queerly, and as there was a
glimpse of his profile she saw for the first time a resemblance
to his father.</p>

<p>She watched them. In the middle of the street Bibbs had to step
ahead of his father, and the two were separated. But the reckless
passing of a truck, beyond the second line of rails, frightened
a group of country women who were in course of passage; they were
just in front of Bibbs, and shoved backward upon him violently.
To extricate himself from them he stepped back, directly in front
of a moving trolley-car&mdash;no place for absent-mindedness, but Bibbs
was still absorbed in thoughts concerned with what he had been
saying to his father. There were shrieks and yells; Bibbs looked
the wrong way&mdash;and then Mary saw the heavy figure of Sheridan
plunge straight forward in front of the car. With absolute disregard
of his own life, he hurled himself at Bibbs like a football-player
shunting off an opponent, and to Mary it seemed that they both
went down together. But that was all she could see&mdash;automobiles,
trucks, and wagons closed in between. She made out that the trolley-car
stopped jerkily, and she saw a policeman breaking his way through
the instantly condensing crowd, while the traffic came to a standstill,
and people stood up in automobiles or climbed upon the hubs and
tires of wheels, not to miss a chance of seeing anything horrible.</p>

<p>Mary tried to get through; it was impossible. Other policemen
came to help the first, and in a minute or two the traffic was
in motion again. The crowd became pliant, dispersing&mdash;there was
no figure upon the ground, and no ambulance came. But one of the
policemen was detained by the clinging and beseeching of a gloved
hand.</p>

<p>"What IS the matter, lady?"</p>

<p>"Where are they?" Mary cried.</p>

<p>"Who? Ole man Sheridan? I reckon HE wasn't much hurt!"</p>

<p>"His <em>SON</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was that who the other one was? I seen him knock him&mdash;oh, he's
not bad off, I guess, lady. The ole man got him out of the way
all right. The fender shoved the ole man around some, but I reckon
he only got shook up. They both went on in the Sheridan Building
without any help. Excuse me, lady."</p>

<p>Sheridan and Bibbs, in fact, were at that moment in the elevator,
ascending. "Whisk-broom up in the office," Sheridan was saying.
"You got to look out on those corners nowadays, I tell you. I
don't know I got any call to blow, though&mdash;because I tried to
cross after you did. That's how I happened to run into you. Well,
you want to remember to look out after this. We were talkin' about
Murtrie's askin' sixty-eight thousand flat for that ninety-nine-year
lease. It's his lookout if he'd rather take it that way, and I
don't know but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Bibbs, emphatically, as the elevator stopped; "he
won't get it. Not from us, he won't, and I'll show you why. I
can convince you in five minutes." He followed his father into
the office anteroom&mdash;and convinced him. Then, having been diligently
brushed by a youth of color, Bibbs went into his own room and
closed the door.</p>

<p>He was more shaken than he had allowed his father to perceive,
and his side was sore where Sheridan had struck him. He desired
to be alone; he wanted to rub himself and, for once, to do some
useless thinking again. He knew that his father had not "happened"
to run into him; he knew that Sheridan had instantly&mdash;and instinctively&mdash;proved
that he held his own life of no account whatever compared to that
of his son and heir. Bibbs had been unable to speak of that, or
to seem to know it; for Sheridan, just as instinctively, had swept
the matter aside&mdash;as of no importance, since all was well&mdash;reverting
immediately to business.</p>

<p>Bibbs began to think intently of his father. He perceived, as
he had never perceived before, the shadowing of something enormous
and indomitable&mdash;and lawless; not to be daunted by the will of
nature's very self; laughing at the lightning and at wounds and
mutilation; conquering, irresistible&mdash;and blindly noble. For the
first time in his life Bibbs began to understand the meaning of
being truly this man's son.</p>

<p>He would be the more truly his son henceforth, though, as Sheridan
said, Bibbs had not come down-town with him meanly or half-heartedly.
He had given his word because he had wanted the money, simply,
for Mary Vertrees in her need. And he shivered with horror of
himself, thinking how he had gone to her to offer it, asking her
to marry him&mdash;with his head on his breast in shameful fear that
she would accept him! He had not known her; the knowing had lost
her to him, and this had been his real awakening; for he knew
now how deep had been that slumber wherein he dreamily celebrated
the superiority of "friendship"! The sleep-walker had wakened
to bitter knowledge of love and life, finding himself a failure
in both. He had made a burnt offering of his dreams, and the sacrifice
had been an unforgivable hurt to Mary. All that was left for him
was the work he had not chosen, but at least he would not fail
in that, though it was indeed no more than "dust in his mouth."
If there had been anything "to work for&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went to the window, raised it, and let in the uproar of the
streets below. He looked down at the blurred, hurrying swarms
and he looked across, over the roofs with their panting jets of
vapor, into the vast, foggy heart of the smoke. Dizzy traceries
of steel were rising dimly against it, chattering with steel on
steel, and screeching in steam, while tiny figures of men walked
on threads in the dull sky. Buildings would overtop the Sheridan.
Bigness was being served.</p>

<p>But what for? The old question came to Bibbs with a new despair.
Here, where his eyes fell, had once been green fields and running
brooks, and how had the kind earth been despoiled and disfigured!
The pioneers had begun the work, but in their old age their orators
had said for them that they had toiled and risked and sacrificed
that their posterity might live in peace and wisdom, enjoying
the fruits of the earth. Well, their posterity was here&mdash;and there
was only turmoil. Where was the promised land? It had been promised
by the soldiers of all the wars; it had been promised to this
generation by the pioneers; but here was the very posterity to
whom it had been promised, toiling and risking and sacrificing
in turn&mdash;for what?</p>

<p>The harsh roar of the city came in through the open window, continuously
beating upon Bibbs's ear until he began to distinguish a pulsation
in it&mdash;a broken and irregular cadence. It seemed to him that it
was like a titanic voice, discordant, hoarse, rustily metallic&mdash;the
voice of the god, Bigness. And the voice summoned Bibbs as it
summoned all its servants.</p>

<p>"Come and work!" it seemed to yell. "Come and work for Me, all
men! By your youth and your hope I summon you! By your age and
your despair I summon you to work for Me yet a little, with what
strength you have. By your love of home I summon you! By your
love of woman I summon you! By your hope of children I summon
you!</p>

<p>"You shall be blind slaves of Mine, blind to everything but Me,
your Master and Driver! For your reward you shall gaze only upon
my ugliness. You shall give your toil and your lives, you shall
go mad for love and worship of my ugliness! You shall perish still
worshipping Me, and your children shall perish knowing no other
god!"</p>

<p>And then, as Bibbs closed the window down tight, he heard his
father's voice booming in the next room; he could not distinguish
the words but the tone was exultant&mdash;and there came the <em>THUMP!
THUMP! </em>of the maimed hand. Bibbs guessed that Sheridan was
bragging of the city and of Bigness to some visitor from out-of-town.</p>

<p>And he thought how truly Sheridan was the high priest of Bigness.
But with the old, old thought again, "What for?" Bibbs caught
a glimmer of far, faint light. He saw that Sheridan had all his
life struggled and conquered, and must all his life go on struggling
and inevitably conquering, as part of a vast impulse not his own.
Sheridan served blindly&mdash;but was the impulse blind? Bibbs asked
himself if it was not he who had been in the greater hurry, after
all. The kiln must be fired before the vase is glazed, and the
Acropolis was not crowned with marble in a day.</p>

<p>Then the voice came to him again, but there was a strain in it
as of some high music struggling to be born of the turmoil. "Ugly
I am," it seemed to say to him, "but never forget that I AM a
god!" And the voice grew in sonorousness and in dignity. "The
highest should serve, but so long as you worship me for my own
sake I will not serve you. It is man who makes me ugly, by his
worship of me. If man would let me serve him, I should be beautiful!"</p>

<p>Looking once more from the window, Bibbs sculptured for himself&mdash;in
the vague contortions of the smoke and fog above the roofs&mdash;a
gigantic figure with feet pedestaled upon the great buildings
and shoulders disappearing in the clouds, a colossus of steel
and wholly blackened with soot. But Bibbs carried his fancy further&mdash;for
there was still a little poet lingering in the back of his head&mdash;and
he thought that up over the clouds, unseen from below, the giant
labored with his hands in the clean sunshine; and Bibbs had a
glimpse of what he made there&mdash;perhaps for a fellowship of the
children of the children that were children now&mdash;a noble and joyous
city, unbelievably white&mdash;</p>

<p>It was the telephone that called him from his vision. It rang
fiercely.</p>

<p>He lifted the thing from his desk and answered&mdash;and as the small
voice inside it spoke he dropped the receiver with a crash. He
trembled violently as he picked it up, but he told himself he
was wrong&mdash;he had been mistaken&mdash;yet it was a startlingly beautiful
voice; startlingly kind, too, and ineffably like the one he hungered
most to hear.</p>

<p>"Who?" he said, his own voice shaking&mdash;like his hand.</p>

<p>"Mary."</p>

<p>He responded with two hushed and incredulous words: "IS IT?"</p>

<p>There was a little thrill of pathetic half-laughter in the instrument.
"Bibbs &mdash;I wanted to&mdash;just to see if you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;Mary?"</p>

<p>"I was looking when you were so nearly run over. I saw it, Bibbs.
They said you hadn't been hurt, they thought, but I wanted to
know for myself."</p>

<p>"No, no, I wasn't hurt at all &mdash;Mary. It was father who
came nearer it. He saved me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw; but you had fallen. I couldn't get through the crowd
until you had gone. And I wanted to <em>KNOW</em>."</p>

<p>"Mary&mdash;would you&mdash;have minded?" he said.</p>

<p>There was a long interval before she answered.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bibbs?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say," he cried. "It's so wonderful to hear
your voice again&mdash;I'm shaking, Mary&mdash;<em>I&mdash;I </em>don't know
&mdash;I don't know anything except that I AM talking to you!
It IS you &mdash;Mary?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bibbs!"</p>

<p>"Mary &mdash;I've seen you from my window at home&mdash;only five
times since <em>I&mdash;</em>since then. You looked&mdash;oh, how can I
tell you? It was like a man chained in a cave catching a glimpse
of the blue sky, Mary. Mary, won't you&mdash;let me see you again&mdash;near?
I think I could make you really forgive me&mdash;you'd have to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I <em>DID&mdash;</em>then."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not really&mdash;or you wouldn't have said you couldn't see me
any more."</p>

<p>"That wasn't the reason." The voice was very low.</p>

<p>"Mary," he said, even more tremulously than before, "I can't&mdash;you
<em>COULDN'T </em>mean it was because&mdash;you can't mean it was because
you&mdash;care?"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Mary?" he called, huskily. "If you mean <em>THAT&mdash;</em>you'd
let me see you&mdash;wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>And now the voice was so low he could not be sure it spoke at
all, but if it did, the words were, "Yes, Bibbs&mdash;dear."</p>

<p>But the voice was not in the instrument&mdash;it was so gentle and
so light, so almost nothing, it seemed to be made of air&mdash;and
it came from the air.</p>

<p>Slowly and incredulously he turned&mdash;and glory fell upon his shining
eyes. The door of his father's room had opened.</p>

<p>Mary stood upon the threshold.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>
