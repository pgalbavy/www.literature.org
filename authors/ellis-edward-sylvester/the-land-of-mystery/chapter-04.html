<p>It will be recalled that the Professor started in pursuit of
the flying native with as much ardor as his friend, but, less
skilful than he, he had taken but a step or two, when an obstruction
flung him to the ground with discouraging emphasis.</p>

<p>Concluding that he had undertaken a futile task, he hastily climbed
to his feet to await the return of Long who, he was satisfied,
would attempt only a brief pursuit.</p>

<p>Remembering the javelin which had whizzed so near his crown,
he cast about for a moment and picked it up from the earth where
it lay but a few feet distant.  As he balanced it in his hand,
he observed that it was about six feet in length, was made entirely
of wood, which was heavy and as hard and smooth as polished ebony.</p>

<p>The light of the moon was like that of the day itself.  It would
have been easy to read ordinary print by it.  He had no trouble,
therefore, in closely examining the novel implement of war.  As
he suspected, the point was made of stone or flint, ground almost
to needle-like sharpness and securely fastened in place by a fine
tendon wound around the portion of the stick that held the harder
part.  This was covered with a gummy substance extending to the
end.</p>

<p>This he was satisfied was among the most virulent of substances
known to toxicology.  A puncture of the skin was sure to be fatal
unless some remedy, of whose existence he held no suspicion, was
instantly obtainable.</p>

<p>He had set down his rifle white examining the weapon, but quickly
caught it up again, still retaining the javelin in his right band. 
He had been startled by the sound of the terrific threshing among
the trees on his right.</p>

<p>He supposed that his friend was coming back, but, glancing toward
the point where he expected him to appear, he was amazed to see
the third native, who whisked off before Long could draw a bead
on him, step from the wood not twenty paces away.  His back was
toward the Professor, and, strangely enough, he did not observe
the white man&mdash;an oversight that never could have occurred, but
for the tumult in the undergrowth which held his attention.</p>

<p>Grimcke had hardly caught sight of him, when the other native
came flying to view, so astonishing his waiting comrade that he
stood a moment irresolute after the white pursuer burst into sight.</p>

<p>Brief as was this pause, it gave the Professor time for some
exceedingly fine work.  He uttered a shout which caused the native
to turn his affrighted gaze behind him, just in time to observe
the white man with javelin raised and apparently in the very act
of launching it at him.</p>

<p>The savage knew what a prick from that frightful thing meant,
and with a howling shriek he ducked his head as though he had
caught its whizz through the air, and shot among the trees with
as much celerity as his companion had shown in coming from them.</p>

<p>Neither of the explorers wished to slay the natives, no matter
how savage, unless compelled to do so in actual self-defence. 
Long had recovered from his first burst of fury, and, though the
Professor could have sunk the javelin in the naked body, he withheld
it, not unwilling that his assailant, now that he had started
to flee, should escape.</p>

<p>The one who had so foolishly come back to the river side was
left in the worst possible situation, for both his enemies stood
between him and the sheltering forest and he was defenceless. 
He was at their mercy, and such people as those natives neither
gave nor expected quarter, when engaged in their savage warfare.</p>

<p>The fellow acted like a bewildered animal.  The white strangers
were standing a few paces apart, so as to form the two angles
of a triangle, while he made the third.  The nearest point to
the forest way midway between Grimcke and Long, as was apparent
to the savage, who was fairly cornered.</p>

<p>Had the Xingu behind him been as placid as farther above or below
the rapids, he would not have hesitated to plunge into its waters,
trusting to his skill in swimming; but, to dive into the raging
current would have been as certain destruction as for a man to
undertake to swim unaided through the whirlpool below Niagara.</p>

<p>Grimcke and Long were not unwilling to torment the fellow, because
of his cowardly attempt a few minutes before, though, as has been
stated, neither intended to do him any special harm.</p>

<p>The affrighted native crouched down, as though seeking to draw
himself into such a narrow compass that the terrible javelin could
not reach him.  Despite the proof he had seen of the power of
the civilized weapons, he held his own in greater dread.</p>

<p>Grimcke raised the spear, as if poising it aloft to hurl at the
savage. The latter uttered a howl of terror, and, with his head
still low, attempted to dart between the strangers.  Naturally
he shied as far away as possible from the Professor, and thereby
brought himself almost close enough to touch Jared.</p>

<p>"That's what I want," muttered the latter, hurriedly concentrating
his strength in his good right leg, and delivering the most powerful
kick at his command.</p>

<p>It was well aimed and most effectively landed.  The Professor
was sure he heard the "dull thud," and always insisted that the
recipient was lifted clear of the ground and propelled among the
trees with an impetus sufficient to break his neck.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed the New Englander, looking around, "I guess
I'm through!"</p>

<p>"I am sure that last fellow hopes so," said the Professor with
a laugh, "for it's safe to conclude he was never handled with
such vigor before."</p>

<p>The levity which both felt over their triumphant routing of their
assailants was checked by the sight of the stark, lifeless form
on the ground, only a few paces distant.</p>

<p>They had the best plea in the world for shooting the fierce savage,
but the consciousness that the necessity existed and that the
deed had been done, rendered them serious and thoughtful.</p>

<p>There was reason for believing the other natives would watch
them from the forest, and the one who retained his javelin was
likely to seek the chance to use it again.  He certainly had strong
temptation to do so, with the prospect of little risk to himself.</p>

<p>Besides, as the explorers followed the rapids, their uproar increased
to that extent that the savages could move freely without danger
of any noise being overheard.</p>

<p>The most prudent thing to do seemed for the friends to walk so
briskly as to disconcert any plan their enemies might have formed. 
This was quite easy, because of the open space, already mentioned,
as lining both banks of the Xingu.</p>

<p>Fortunately the distance to camp was not far, and, with the hurried
pace adopted by the Professor and Long, it ought not to occupy
more than a few minutes, provided no interruption occurred.  Strange
emotions tortured both, as they kept their eyes fixed on the dark
wood at their side, from which they expected the sweep of the
fearful javelin, whose touch was death.</p>

<p>The keenest hearing could not detect the faint whizz, while the
roar of the rapids was in their ears, and they had to depend,
therefore, on their eyes, which promised to be of little more
service.</p>

<p>But the entire distance was almost passed, and the hearts of
the two were beating high with increasing hope, when Long, with
a gasp of terror, grasped the arm of the Professor with incredible
force, and jerking him backward, pointed with his extended finger
to the camp in front of them.</p>
