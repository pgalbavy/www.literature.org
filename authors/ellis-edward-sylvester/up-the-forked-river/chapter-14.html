<p>The tug rounded to and approached the shore so close that by
running out the gangplank, the young women were readily assisted
to land. They were nervously eager, for there was no saying when
the hostile craft would appear and open fire, since its crew and
leader must be unaware of the presence of the noncombatants.</p>

<p>General Yozarro could not have been more thoughtful. He was profuse
in his regrets because it was necessary to subject them to this
inconvenience, and he assured both over and over again that everything
would be done for their comfort.</p>

<p>"You know the Castle is prepared for your stay, which I hope
will be brief; I shall see that nothing is neglected and you will
hear from me tomorrow."</p>

<p>The three were standing for a minute or two on the bank, having
but little luggage to take with them, since, when they left Atlamalco
nothing like this had been dreamed of by the two.</p>

<p>"But, General," said the Señorita, "it is a mile to the Castle;
how are we to reach there alone and at night?"</p>

<p>Before he answered, two men came silently out of the gloomy wood.
They were in the uniform of soldiers, and one of them, saluting,
said:</p>

<p>"General, we have the horses saddled and waiting."</p>

<p>"That is fortunate; I will assist you to mount."</p>

<p>This time he did not press the hand of Miss Starland, when with
his slight help, she vaulted into the saddle, nor did he sigh
or give expression to anything sentimental. The time was too critical
for anything like that. He waved them farewell, hurried aboard
over the plank, which was quickly drawn in, and the screw of the
tugboat began churning the muddy water, as she circled slowly
about and headed up stream.</p>

<p>The young women, being mounted, looked apprehensively out over
the moonlit stream, expecting and dreading the coming of the other
boat which was to fire the opening gun of another senseless and
vicious conflict between the peppery republics. The situation,
however, was too dangerous for them to wait more than a few minutes,
and one of the soldiers, doffing his sombrero, spoke with the
utmost deference:</p>

<p>"I will lead the way and your horse will follow. My comrade will
walk at the rear; be assured there is no danger."</p>

<p>Each man carried a musket and the one who had spoken turned inland.
The horse of the American followed, the gait of all being the
ordinary walk. The Señorita was only a few steps behind her, while
the second soldier silently stalked at the rear. The American
noticed that they were following a clearly marked path or trail,
which soon began descending, then climbed upward, and wound around
and between rocks, the gloom in some places being so deep that
she caught only shadowy glimpses of the guide in front, as he
plodded onward like one familiar with his course. At times there
were openings where the light was like that at mid-day. She might
well have trembled had not her animal been sure-footed, for they
had penetrated no more than a few hundred yards, when the little
procession began threading along the face of a mass of rocks,
where the path was so narrow that she felt the swish of her skirts
against the mountain wall, and on her right it sloped downward
perpendicularly, until what seemed a bottomless pit was hidden
in a pool of gloom. A misstep by any member of the party would
have sent him or her to instant destruction. But the animals and
men moved confidently, though the pace was slow. Evidently, with
the exception of the women, all were familiar, not only with this
method of traveling, but with this particular route.</p>

<p>As soon as our friends had become accustomed to the work, the
thoughts of both reverted to the river, and they listened with
shrinking foreboding for the sound of the guns that would mark
the opening of the fight between the two craft. General Yozarro
had declared that he would not permit the boat of his enemy to
reach the capital, and he intimated that as soon as he was released
from the care of the ladies, he would be quick to open the naval
battle.</p>

<p>"He steamed up stream," reflected Miss Starland, "but he will
not go far; he is seeking a favorable position near by and the
conflict will be a fierce one."</p>

<p>But the minutes passed and the silence was unbroken. Naught but
the myriad voices of the jungle thrummed into her ears and she
found herself wondering what the explanation of the continued
silence could be. Had General Yozarro changed his mind and hastened
to his capital, with the decision to offer defence there? She
could not believe it. It seemed more probable that he had hurried
down the river toward Zalapata to meet his antagonist, who may
have turned and fled to his own town. Even this looked unlikely,
but it was the only explanation that presented itself. She would
have liked to converse with her friend, but the circumstances
were unfavorable. The continual shifting of conditions compelled
her to keep a firm seat and rein and to watch every step of her
horse.</p>

<p>As the minutes passed and they penetrated farther into the interior,
without hearing the boom of the gun, a disquieting question forced
itself upon her. How did it come about that when she and her friend
were put ashore, two soldiers were awaiting them, with properly
saddled animals? It could not have been accident or coincidence.
They must have been there by order of General Yozarro, who intended
from the first that the landing should be made. No other theory
was reasonable. Had any doubt lingered, it would have been removed
by the silence of the armed craft.</p>

<p>This question inevitably suggested the other as to the reason
why General Yozarro had adopted so extraordinary a policy. Had
he wished to send the two to the Castle, there was not the shadow
of a difficulty in doing so, by the simplest and most direct means.
As we know, they had already visited the gloomy building and would
not have hesitated to accompany him again. Why all this mystery
of landing them from the boat at night and sending them into the
mountains in charge of two of his soldiers?</p>

<p>The thoughts that thronged upon the American were too perplexing
for solution, and she resolutely put them away for a more convenient
season. When she and her comrade could sit down and talk in quietude,
they might formulate the explanation which at present was beyond
reach.</p>

<p>One resolution, however, had crystallized: she would lose no
time or opportunity in getting beyond the domain of General Yozarro
and would never again willingly enter it. She had had more than
enough of Zalapata as well as Atlamalco, and yearned for the return
of Jack's yacht, when they could flit from a country which she
had come to detest unutterably. She dearly loved Manuela and could
not reconcile herself to the thought of losing her companionship
forever; but from this time forward, the American must voyage
to the country which had been her home for years, and where she
could be assured of respectful treatment.</p>
