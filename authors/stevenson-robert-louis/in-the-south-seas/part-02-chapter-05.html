<p>No, I had no guess of these men’s terrors.  Yet I had received ere that a
hint, if I had understood; and the occasion was a funeral.
</p>
<p>A little apart in the main avenue of Rotoava, in a low hut of leaves that
opened on a small enclosure, like a pigsty on a pen, an old man dwelt
solitary with his aged wife.  Perhaps they were too old to migrate with
the others; perhaps they were too poor, and had no possessions to
dispute.  At least they had remained behind; and it thus befell that they
were invited to my feast.  I dare say it was quite a piece of politics in
the pigsty whether to come or not to come, and the husband long swithered
between curiosity and age, till curiosity conquered, and they came, and
in the midst of that last merrymaking death tapped him on the shoulder.
For some days, when the sky was bright and the wind cool, his mat would
be spread in the main highway of the village, and he was to be seen lying
there inert, a mere handful of a man, his wife inertly seated by his
head.  They seemed to have outgrown alike our needs and faculties; they
neither spoke nor listened; they suffered us to pass without a glance;
the wife did not fan, she seemed not to attend upon her husband, and the
two poor antiques sat juxtaposed under the high canopy of palms, the
human tragedy reduced to its bare elements, a sight beyond pathos,
stirring a thrill of curiosity.  And yet there was one touch of the
pathetic haunted me: that so much youth and expectation should have run
in these starved veins, and the man should have squandered all his lees
of life on a pleasure party.
</p><p>On the morning of 17th September the sufferer died, and, time pressing,
he was buried the same day at four.  The cemetery lies to seaward behind
Government House; broken coral, like so much road-metal, forms the
surface; a few wooden crosses, a few inconsiderable upright stones,
designate graves; a mortared wall, high enough to lean on, rings it
about; a clustering shrub surrounds it with pale leaves.  Here was the
grave dug that morning, doubtless by uneasy diggers, to the sound of the
nigh sea and the cries of sea-birds; meanwhile the dead man waited in his
house, and the widow and another aged woman leaned on the fence before
the door, no speech upon their lips, no speculation in their eyes.
</p><p>Sharp at the hour the procession was in march, the coffin wrapped in
white and carried by four bearers; mourners behind—not many, for not many
remained in Rotoava, and not many in black, for these were poor; the men
in straw hats, white coats, and blue trousers or the gorgeous
parti-coloured pariu, the Tahitian kilt; the women, with a few
exceptions, brightly habited.  Far in the rear came the widow, painfully
carrying the dead man’s mat; a creature aged beyond humanity, to the
likeness of some missing link.
</p><p>The dead man had been a Mormon; but the Mormon clergyman was gone with
the rest to wrangle over boundaries in the adjacent isle, and a layman
took his office.  Standing at the head of the open grave, in a white coat
and blue pariu, his Tahitian Bible in his hand and one eye bound with a
red handkerchief, he read solemnly that chapter in Job which has been
read and heard over the bones of so many of our fathers, and with a good
voice offered up two prayers.  The wind and the surf bore a burthen.  By
the cemetery gate a mother in crimson suckled an infant rolled in blue.
In the midst the widow sat upon the ground and polished one of the
coffin-stretchers with a piece of coral; a little later she had turned
her back to the grave and was playing with a leaf.  Did she understand?
God knows.  The officiant paused a moment, stooped, and gathered and
threw reverently on the coffin a handful of rattling coral.  Dust to
dust: but the grains of this dust were gross like cherries, and the true
dust that was to follow sat near by, still cohering (as by a miracle) in
the tragic semblance of a female ape.
</p><p>So far, Mormon or not, it was a Christian funeral.  The well-known
passage had been read from Job, the prayers had been rehearsed, the grave
was filled, the mourners straggled homeward.  With a little coarser grain
of covering earth, a little nearer outcry of the sea, a stronger glare of
sunlight on the rude enclosure, and some incongruous colours of attire,
the well-remembered form had been observed.
</p><p>By rights it should have been otherwise.  The mat should have been buried
with its owner; but, the family being poor, it was thriftily reserved for
a fresh service.  The widow should have flung herself upon the grave and
raised the voice of official grief, the neighbours have chimed in, and
the narrow isle rung for a space with lamentation.  But the widow was
old; perhaps she had forgotten, perhaps never understood, and she played
like a child with leaves and coffin-stretchers.  In all ways my guest was
buried with maimed rites.  Strange to think that his last conscious
pleasure was the <u>Casco</u> and my feast; strange to think that he had
limped there, an old child, looking for some new good.  And the good
thing, rest, had been allotted him.
</p><p>But though the widow had neglected much, there was one part she must not
utterly neglect.  She came away with the dispersing funeral; but the dead
man’s mat was left behind upon the grave, and I learned that by set of
sun she must return to sleep there.  This vigil is imperative.  From
sundown till the rising of the morning star the Paumotuan must hold his
watch above the ashes of his kindred.  Many friends, if the dead have
been a man of mark, will keep the watchers company; they will be well
supplied with coverings against the weather; I believe they bring food,
and the rite is persevered in for two weeks.  Our poor survivor, if,
indeed, she properly survived, had little to cover, and few to sit with
her; on the night of the funeral a strong squall chased her from her
place of watch; for days the weather held uncertain and outrageous; and
ere seven nights were up she had desisted, and returned to sleep in her
low roof.  That she should be at the pains of returning for so short a
visit to a solitary house, that this borderer of the grave should fear a
little wind and a wet blanket, filled me at the time with musings.  I
could not say she was indifferent; she was so far beyond me in experience
that the court of my criticism waived jurisdiction; but I forged excuses,
telling myself she had perhaps little to lament, perhaps suffered much,
perhaps understood nothing.  And lo! in the whole affair there was no
question whether of tenderness or piety, and the sturdy return of this
old remnant was a mark either of uncommon sense or of uncommon fortitude.
</p><p>Yet one thing had occurred that partly set me on the trail.  I have said
the funeral passed much as at home.  But when all was over, when we were
trooping in decent silence from the graveyard gate and down the path to
the settlement, a sudden inbreak of a different spirit startled and
perhaps dismayed us.  Two people walked not far apart in our procession:
my friend Mr. Donat—Donat-Rimarau: ‘Donat the much-handed’—acting
Vice-Resident, present ruler of the archipelago, by far the man of chief
importance on the scene, but known besides for one of an unshakable good
temper; and a certain comely, strapping young Paumotuan woman, the
comeliest on the isle, not (let us hope) the bravest or the most polite.
Of a sudden, ere yet the grave silence of the funeral was broken, she
made a leap at the Resident, with pointed finger, shrieked a few words,
and fell back again with a laughter, not a natural mirth.  ‘What did she
say to you?’ I asked.  ‘She did not speak to <u>me</u>,’ said Donat, a shade
perturbed; ‘she spoke to the ghost of the dead man.’  And the purport of
her speech was this: ‘See there!  Donat will be a fine feast for you
to-night.’
</p><p>‘M. Donat called it a jest,’ I wrote at the time in my diary.  ‘It seemed
to me more in the nature of a terrified conjuration, as though she would
divert the ghost’s attention from herself.  A cannibal race may well have
cannibal phantoms.’  The guesses of the traveller appear foredoomed to be
erroneous; yet in these I was precisely right.  The woman had stood by in
terror at the funeral, being then in a dread spot, the graveyard.  She
looked on in terror to the coming night, with that ogre, a new spirit,
loosed upon the isle.  And the words she had cried in Donat’s face were
indeed a terrified conjuration, basely to shield herself, basely to
dedicate another in her stead.  One thing is to be said in her excuse.
Doubtless she partly chose Donat because he was a man of great
good-nature, but partly, too, because he was a man of the half-caste.
For I believe all natives regard white blood as a kind of talisman
against the powers of hell.  In no other way can they explain the
unpunished recklessness of Europeans.
