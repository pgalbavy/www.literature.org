<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The week passed swiftly, day after day echoing with the steady
fusillade from marsh to covert, from valley to ridge. Guns flashed
at dawn and dusk along the flat tidal reaches haunted of black
mallard and teal; the smokeless powder cracked through alder swamp
and tangled windfall where the brown grouse burst away into noisy
blundering flight; where the woodcock, wilder now, shrilled skyward
like feathered rockets, and the big northern hares, not yet flecked
with snowy patches of fur, loped off into swamps to the sad undoing
of several of the younger setters.</p>

<p>There was a pheasant drive at Black Fells to which the Ferralls'
guests were bidden by Beverly Plank&mdash;a curious scene, where ladies
and gentlemen stood on a lawn, backed by an army of loaders and
gun-bearers, while another improvised army of beaters drove some
thousands of frightened, bewildered, homeless foreign pheasants
at the guns. And the miserable aliens that escaped the guns were
left to perish in the desolation of a coming winter which they
were unfitted to withstand.</p>

<p>So the first week of the season sped gaily, ending on Saturday
with a heavy flight of northern woodcock and an uproarious fusillade
among the silver birches.</p>

<p>Once Ferrall loaded two motor cars with pioneers for a day beyond
his own boundaries; and one day was spent ingloriously with the
beagles; but otherwise the Shotover estate proved more than sufficient
for good bags or target practice, as the skill of the sportsmen
developed.</p>

<p>Lord Alderdene, good enough on snipe and cock, was driven almost
frantic by the ruffed grouse; Voucher did better for a day or
two, and then lost the knack; Marion Page attended to business
in her cool and thorough style, and her average on the gun-room
books was excellent, and was also adorned with clever pen-and-ink
sketches by Siward.</p>

<p>Leroy Mortimer had given up shooting and established himself
as a haunter of cushions in sunny corners. Tom O'Hara had gone
back to Lenox; Mrs. Vendenning to Hot Springs. Beverly Plank,
master of Black Fells, began to pervade the house after a tentative
appearance; and he and Major Belwether pottered about the coverts,
usually after luncheon&mdash;the latter doing little damage with his
fowling-piece, and nobody knew how much with his gossiping tongue.
Quarrier appeared in the field methodically, shot with judgment,
taking no chances for a brilliant performance which might endanger
his respectable average. As for the Page boys, they kept the river
ducks stirring whenever Eileen Shannon and Rena Bonnesdel could
be persuaded to share the canoes with them. Otherwise they haunted
the vicinity of those bored maidens, suffering snubs sorrowfully,
but persistently faithful. They were a great nuisance in the evening,
especially as their sister did not permit them to lose more than
ten dollars a day at cards.</p>

<p>Cards&mdash;that is Bridge and Preference&mdash;ruled as usual; and the
latter game being faster suited Mortimer and Ferrall, but did
not aid Siward toward recouping his Bridge losses.</p>

<p>Noticing this, late in the week, Major Belwether kindly suggested
Klondyke for Siward's benefit, which proved more quickly disastrous
to him than anything yet proposed; and he went back to Bridge,
preferring rather to "carry" Agatha Caithness at intervals than
crumble into bankruptcy under the sheer deadly hazard of Klondyke.</p>

<p>Two matters occupied him; since "cup day" he had never had another
opportunity to see Sylvia Landis alone; that was the first matter.
He had touched neither wine nor spirits nor malt since the night
Ferrall had found him prone, sprawling in a stupor on his disordered
bed. That was the second matter, and it occupied him, at times
required all his attention, particularly when the physical desire
for it set in, steadily, mercilessly, mounting inexorably like
a tide. … But, like the tide, it ebbed at last, particularly when
a sleepless night had exhausted him.</p>

<p>He had gone back to his shooting again after a cool review of
the ethics involved. It even amused him to think that the whimsical
sermon delivered him by a girl who had cleverness enough to marry
many millions, with Quarrier thrown in, could have so moved him
to sentimentality. He had ceded the big cup of antique silver
to Quarrier, too&mdash;a matter which troubled him little, however,
as in the irritation of the reaction he had been shooting with
the brilliancy of a demon; and the gun-room books were open to
any doubting guests' inspection.</p>

<p>Time, therefore, was never heavy on his hands, save when the
tide threatened&mdash;when at night he stirred and awoke, conscious
of its crawling advance, aware of its steady mounting menace.
Moments at table, when the aroma of wine made him catch his breath,
moments in the gun-room redolent of spicy spirits; a maddening
volatile fragrance clinging to the card-room, too! Yes, the long
days were filled with such moments for him.</p>

<p>But afield the desire faded; and even during the day, indoors,
he shrugged desire aside. It was night that he dreaded&mdash;the long
hours, lying there tense, stark-eyed, sickened with desire.</p>

<p>As for Sylvia, she and Grace Ferrall had taken to motoring, driving
away into the interior or taking long flights north and south
along the coast. Sometimes they took Quarrier, sometimes, when
Mrs. Ferrall drove, they took in ballast in the shape of a superfluous
Page boy and a girl for him. Once Grace Ferrall asked Siward to
join them; but no definite time being set, he was scarcely surprised
to find them gone when he returned from a morning on the snipe
meadows. And Sylvia, leagues away by that time, curled up in the
tonneau beside Grace Ferrall, watched the dark pines flying past,
cheeks pink, eyes like stars, while the rushing wind drove health
into her and care out of her&mdash;cleansing, purifying, overwhelming
winds flowing through and through her, till her very soul within
her seemed shining through the beauty of her eyes. Besides, she
had just confessed.</p>

<p>"He kissed you!" repeated Grace Ferrall incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a number of times. He was silly enough to do it, and I
let him."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;did he say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know what he said; I was all nerves&mdash;confused&mdash;scared&mdash;a
perfect stick in fact! … I don't believe he'd care to try again."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Ferrall deliberately settled down in her furs to extract
from the girl beside her every essential detail; and the girl,
frank at first, grew shy and silent&mdash;reticent enough to worry
her friend into a silence which lasted a long while for a cheerful
little matron of her sort.</p>

<p>Presently they spoke of other matters&mdash;matters interesting to
pretty women with much to do in the coming winter between New
York, Hot Springs, and Florida; surmises as to dinners, dances,
and the newcomers in the younger sets, and the marriages to be
arranged or disarranged, and the scandals humanity is heir to,
and the attitude of the bishop toward divorce.</p>

<p>And the new pavillion to be built for Saint Berold's Hospital,
and the various states of the various charities each was interested
in, and the chances of something new at the opera, and the impossibility
of saving Fifth Avenue from truck traffic, and the increasing
importance of Washington as a social centre, and the bad manners
of a foreign ambassador, and the better manners of another diplomat,
and the lack of discrimination betrayed by our ambassador to a
certain great Power in choosing people for presentation at court,
and the latest unhappy British-American marriage, and the hopelessness
of the French as decent husbands, and the recent accident to the
Claymores' big yacht, and the tendency of well-born young men
toward politics, and the anything but distinguished person of
Lord Alderdene, which was, however, vastly superior to the demeanour
and person of others of his rank recently imported, and the beauty
of Miss Caithness, and the chance that Captain Voucher had if
Leila Mortimer would let him alone, and the absurdity of the Page
twins, and the furtive coarseness of Leroy Mortimer and his general
badness, and the sadness of Leila Mortimer's lot when she had
always been in love with other people,&mdash;and a little scandalous
surmise concerning Tom O'Hara, and the new house on Seventy-ninth
Street building for Mrs. Vendenning, and that charming widow's
success at last year's horse show&mdash;and whether the fashion of
the function was reviving, and whether Beverly Plank had completely
broken into the social sets he had besieged so long, or whether
a few of the hunting and shooting people merely permitted him
to drive pheasants for them, and why Katharyn Tassel made eyes
at him, having sufficient money of her own to die unwed, and&mdash;and&mdash;and
then, at last, as the big motor car swung in a circle at Wenniston
Cross-Roads, and poked its brass and lacquer muzzle toward Shotover,
the talk swung back to Siward once more&mdash;having travelled half
the world over to find him.</p>

<p>"He is the sweetest fellow with his mother," sighed Grace; "and
that counts heavily with me. But there's trouble ahead for her&mdash;sorrow
and trouble enough for them both, if he is a true Siward."</p>

<p>"Heredity again!" said Sylvia impatiently. "Isn't he man enough
to win out? I'll bet you he settles down, marries, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Marries? Not he! How many girls do you suppose have believed
that&mdash;were justified in believing he meant anything by his attractive
manner and nice ways of telling you how much he liked you? He
had a desperate affair with Mrs. Mortimer&mdash;innocent enough I fancy.
He's had a dozen within three years; and in a week Rena Bonnesdel
has come to making eyes at him, and Eileen gives him no end of
chances which he doesn't see. As for Marion Page, the girl had
been on the edge of loving him for years! You laugh? But you are
wrong; she is in love with him now as much as she ever can be
with anybody."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes I do. Hadn't you suspected it?"</p>

<p>And as Sylvia had suspected it she remained silent.</p>

<p>"If any woman in this world could keep him to the mark, she could," 
continued Mrs. Ferrall. "He's a perfect fool not to see how she
cares for him."</p>

<p>Sylvia said: "He is indeed."</p>

<p>"It would be a sensible match, if she cared to risk it, and if
he would only ask her. But he won't."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," ventured Sylvia, "she'll ask him. She strikes me as
that sort. I do not mean it unkindly&mdash;only Marion is so tailor-made
and cigaretteful&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrall looked up at her.</p>

<p>"Did he propose to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I think so."</p>

<p>"Then it's the first time for him. He finds women only too willing
to play with him as a rule, and he doesn't have to be definite.
I wonder what he meant by being so definite with you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he meant marriage," said Sylvia serenely; yet there
was the slightest ring in her voice; and it amused Mrs. Ferrall
to try her a little further.</p>

<p>"Oh, you think he really intended to commit himself?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" retorted Sylvia, turning red. "Do you think he found
me over-willing, as you say he finds others?"</p>

<p>"You were probably a new sensation for him," inferred Mrs. Ferrall
musingly. "You mustn't take him seriously, child&mdash;a man with his
record. Besides, he has the same facility with a girl that he
has with everything else he tries; his pen&mdash;you know how infernally
clever he is; and he can make good verse, and write witty jingles,
and he can carry home with him any opera and play it decently,
too, with the proper harmonies. Anything he finds amusing he is
clever with&mdash;dogs, horses, pen, brush, music, women"&mdash;that was
too malicious, for Sylvia had flushed up painfully, and Grace
Ferrall dropped her gloved hand on the hand of the girl beside
her: "Child, child," she said, "he is not that sort; no decent
man ever is unless the girl is too."</p>

<p>Sylvia, sitting up very straight in her furs, said: "He found
me anything but difficult&mdash;if that's what you mean."</p>

<p>"I don't. Please don't be vexed, dear. I plague everybody when
I see an opening. There's really only one thing that worries me
about it all."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Sylvia without interest.</p>

<p>"It's that you might be tempted to care a little for him, which,
being useless, might be unwise."</p>

<p>"I am … tempted."</p>

<p>"Not seriously!"</p>

<p>"I don't know." She turned in a sudden nervous impatience foreign
to her. "Howard Quarrier is too perfectly imperfect for me. I'm
glad I've said it. The things he knows about and doesn't know
have been a revelation in this last week with him. There is too
much surface, too much exterior admirably fashioned. And inside
is all clock-work. I've said it; I'm glad I have. He seemed different
at Newport; he seemed nice at Lenox. The truth is, he's a horrid
disappointment&mdash;and I'm bored to death at my brilliant prospects."</p>

<p>The low whizzing hum of the motor filled a silence that produced
considerable effect upon Grace Ferrall. And, after mastering her
wits, she said in a subdued voice:</p>

<p>"Of course it's my meddling."</p>

<p>"Of course it isn't. I asked your opinion, but I knew what I
was going to do. Only, I did think him personally possible&mdash;which
made the expediency, the mercenary view of it easier to contemplate."</p>

<p>She was becoming as frankly brutal as she knew how to be, which
made the revolt the more ominous.</p>

<p>"You don't think you could endure him for an hour or two a day,
Sylvia?"</p>

<p>"It is not that," said the girl almost sullenly.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid of myself&mdash;call it inherited mischief if you like!
If I let a man do to me what Mr. Siward did when I was only engaged
to Howard, what might I do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are not that sort!" said Mrs. Ferrall bluntly. "Don't be
exotic, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"How do you know&mdash;if I don't know? Most girls are kissed; <em>I&mdash;</em>well
I didn't expect to be. But I was! I tell you, Grace, I don't know
what I am or shall be. I'm unsafe; I know that much."</p>

<p>"It's moral and honest to realize it," said Mrs. Ferrall suavely;
"and in doing so you insure your own safety. Sylvia dear, I wish
I hadn't meddled; I'm meddling some more I suppose when I say
to you, don't give Howard his congé for the present. It is a horridly
common thing to dwell upon, but Howard is too materially important
to be cut adrift on the impulse of the moment."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"You are too clever not to. Consider the matter wisely, dispassionately,
intelligently, dear; then if by April you simply can't stand it&mdash;talk
the thing over with me again," she ended rather vaguely and wistfully;
for it had been her heart's desire to wed Sylvia's beauty and
Quarrier's fortune, and the suitability of the one for the other
was apparent enough to make even sterner moralists wobbly in their
creed. Quarrier, as a detail of modern human architecture, she
supposed might fit in somewhere, and took that for granted in
laying the corner stone for her fairy palace which Sylvia was
to inhabit. And now!&mdash;oh, vexation!&mdash;the neglected but essentially
constructive detail of human architecture had buckled, knocking
the dream palace and its princess and its splendour about her
ears.</p>

<p>"Things never happen in real life," she observed plaintively;
"only romances have plots where things work out. But we people
in real life, we just go on and on in a badly constructed, plotless
sort of way with no villains, no interesting situations, no climaxes,
no ensemble. No, we grow old and irritable and meaner and meaner;
we lose our good looks and digestions, and we die in hopeless
discord with the unity required in a dollar and a half novel by
a master of modern fiction."</p>

<p>"But some among us amass fortunes," suggested Sylvia, laughing.</p>

<p>"But we don't live happy ever after. Nobody ever had enough money
in real life."</p>

<p>"Some fall in love," observed Sylvia, musing.</p>

<p>"And they are not content, silly!"</p>

<p>"Why? Because nobody ever had enough love in real life," mocked
Sylvia.</p>

<p>"You have said it, child. That is the malady of the world, and
nobody knows it until some pretty ninny like you babbles the truth.
And that is why we care for those immortals in romance, those
fortunate lovers who, in fable, are given and give enough of love;
those magic shapes in verse and tale whose hearts are satisfied
when the mad author of their being inks his last period and goes
to dinner."</p>

<p>Sylvia laughed awhile, then, chin on wrist, sat musing there,
muffled in her furs.</p>

<p>"As for love, I think I should be moderate in the asking, in
the giving. A little&mdash;to flavour routine&mdash;would be sufficient
for me I fancy."</p>

<p>"You know so much about it," observed Mrs. Ferrall ironically.</p>

<p>"I am permitted to speculate, am I not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Only speculate in sound investments, dear."</p>

<p>"How can you make a sound investment in love? Isn't it always
sheerest speculation?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is why simple matrimony is usually a safer speculation
than love."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;love isn't matrimony."</p>

<p>"Match that with its complementary platitude and you have the
essence of modern fiction," observed Mrs. Ferrall. "Love is a
subject talked to death, which explains the present shortage in
the market I suppose. You're not in love and you don't miss it.
Why cultivate an artificial taste for it? If it ever comes naturally,
you'll be astonished at your capacity for it, and the constant
deterioration in quantity and quality of the visible supply. Goodness!
my epigrams make me yawn&mdash;or is it age and the ill humour of the
aged when the porridge spills over on the family cat?"</p>

<p>"I am the cat, I suppose," asked Sylvia, laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes you are&mdash;and you go tearing away, back up, fur on end, leaving
me by the fire with no porridge and only the aroma of the singeing
fur to comfort me. … Still there's one thing to comfort me."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Kitty-cats come back, dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so. … Do you believe I could induce him to wear
his hair any way except pompadour? … and, dear, his beard is so
dreadfully silky. Isn't there anything he could take for it?"</p>

<p>"Only a razor I'm afraid. Those long, thick, soft, eyelashes
of his are ominous. Eyes of that sort ruin a man for my taste.
He might just as reasonably wear my hat."</p>

<p>"But he can't follow the fashions in eyes," laughed Sylvia. "Oh,
this is atrocious of us&mdash;it is simply horrible to sit here and
say such things. I am cold-blooded enough as it is&mdash;material enough,
mean, covetous, contemptible&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear!" said Grace Ferrall mildly, "you are not choosing a husband;
you are choosing a career. To criticise his investments might
be bad taste; to be able to extract what amusement you can out
of Howard is a direct mercy from Heaven. Otherwise you'd go mad,
you know."</p>

<p>"Grace! Do you wish me to marry him?"</p>

<p>"What is the alternative, dear?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing&mdash;self-respect, dowdiness, and peace."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"All I can see."</p>

<p>"Not Stephen Siward?"</p>

<p>"To marry? No. To enjoy, yes. … Grace, I have had such a good
time with him; you don't know! He is such a boy&mdash;sometimes; and
I &mdash;I believe that I am rather good for him. … Not that I'd
ever again let him do that sort of thing. … Besides, his curiosity
is quenched; I am the sort he supposed. Now he's found out he
will be nice. … It's been days since I've had a talk with him.
He tried to, but I wouldn't. Besides, the major has said nasty
things about him when Howard was present; nothing definite, only
hints, smiling silences, innuendoes on the verge of matters rather
unfit; and I had nothing definite to refute. I could not even
appear to understand or notice&mdash;it was all done in such a horridly
vague way. But it only made me like him; and no doubt that actress
he took to the Patroons is better company than he finds in nine
places out of ten among his own sort."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Grace Ferrall slowly, "if that is the way you feel,
I don't see why you shouldn't play with Mr. Siward whenever you
like."</p>

<p>"Nor I. I've been a perfect fool not to. … Howard hates him."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"What a question! A woman knows such things. Then, you remember
that caricature&mdash;so dreadfully like Howard? Howard has no sense
of humour; he detests such things. It was the most dreadful thing
that Mr. Siward could have done to him."</p>

<p>"Meddled again!" groaned Grace. "Doesn't Howard know that I did
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but nothing I can say alters his conviction that the likeness
was intended. You know it was a likeness! And if Mr. Siward had
not told me that it was not intended, I should never have believed
it to be an accident."</p>

<p>After a prolonged silence Sylvia said, overcarelessly: "I don't
quite understand Howard. With me anger lasts but a moment, and
then I'm open to overtures for peace … I think Howard's anger
lasts."</p>

<p>"It does," said Grace. "He was a muff as a boy&mdash;a prig with a
prig's memory under all his shallow, showy surface. I'm frank
with you; I never could take my cousin either respectfully or
seriously, but I've known him to take his own anger so seriously
that years after he has visited it upon those who had really wronged
him. And he is equipped for retaliation if he chooses. That fortune
of his reaches far. … Not that I think him capable of using such
a power to satisfy a mere personal dislike. Howard has principles,
loads of them. But&mdash;the weapon is there."</p>

<p>"Is it true that Mr. Siward is interested in building electric
roads?"  asked Sylvia curiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know, child. Why?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I wondered."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Mortimer said so."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose he is. I'll ask Kemp if you like. Why? Isn't
it all right to build them?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Howard is in it somehow. In fact Howard's company
is behind Mr. Siward's, I believe."</p>

<p>Grace Ferrall turned and looked at the girl beside her, laughing
outright.</p>

<p>"Oh, Howard doesn't do mysterious financial things to nice young
men because they draw impudent pictures of him running after his
dog&mdash;or for any other reason. That, dear, is one of those skilfully
developed portions of an artistic plot; and plots exist only in
romance. So do villains; and besides, my cousin isn't one. Besides
that, if Howard is in that thing, no doubt Kemp and I are too.
So your nice young man is in very safe company."</p>

<p>"You draw such silly inferences," said Sylvia coolly; but there
was a good deal of colour in her cheeks; and she knew it and pulled
her big motor veil across her face, fastening it under her chin.
All of which amused Grace Ferrall infinitely until the subtler
significance of the girl's mental processes struck her, sobering
her own thoughts. Sylvia, too, had grown serious in her preoccupation;
and the partie-à-deux terminated a few minutes later in a duet
of silence over the tea-cups in the gun-room.</p>

<p>The weather had turned warm and misty; one of those sudden sea-coast
changes had greyed the blue in the sky, spreading a fine haze
over land and water, effacing the crisp sparkle of the sea, dulling
the westering sun.</p>

<p>A few moments later Sylvia, glancing over her shoulder, noticed
that a fine misty drizzle had clouded the casements. That meant
that her usual evening stroll on the cliffs with Quarrier, before
dressing for dinner, was off. And she drew a little breath of
unconscious relief as Marion Page walked in, her light woollen
shooting-jacket, her hat, shoes, and the barrels of the fowling-piece
tucked under her left arm-pit, all glimmering frostily with powdered
rain drops.</p>

<p>She said something to Grace Ferrall about the mist promising
good point-shooting in the morning, took the order book from a
servant, jotted down her request to be called an hour before sunrise,
filled in the gun-room records with her score&mdash;the species and
number bagged, and the number of shells used&mdash;and accepting the
tea offered, drew out a tiny cigarette-case of sweet-bay wood
heavily crusted with rose-gold.</p>

<p>"With whom were you shooting?" asked Grace, as Marion dropped
one well-shaped leg over the other and wreathed her delicately
tanned features in smoke.</p>

<p>"Stephen Siward and Blinky. They're at it yet, but I had some
letters to write." She glanced leisurely at Sylvia and touched
the ash-tray with the whitening end of her cigarette. "That dog
you let Mr. Siward have is a good one. I'm taking him to Jersey
next week for the cock-shooting."</p>

<p>Sylvia returned her calm gaze blankly.</p>

<p>An unreasonable and disagreeable shock had passed through her.</p>

<p>"My North Carolina pointers are useless for close work," observed
Marion indifferently; and she leaned back, watching the blue smoke
curling upward from her cigarette.</p>

<p>Sylvia, distrait, but with downcast eyes on fire under the fringed
lids, was thinking of the cheque Siward had given her for Sagamore.
The transaction, for her, had been a business one on the surface
only. She had never meant to use the cheque. She had laid it away
among a few letters, relics, pleasant souvenirs of the summer.
To her the affair had been softened by a delicate hint of intimacy,&mdash;the
delight he was to take in something that had once been hers had
given her a faint taste of the pleasure of according pleasure
to a man. And this is what he had done!</p>

<p>The drizzle had turned to fog, through which rain was now pelting
the cliffs; people were returning from the open; a motor-car came
whizzing into the drive, and out of it tumbled Rena and Eileen
and the faithful Pages, the girls irritable and ready for tea,
and the boys like a pair of eager, wagging, setter puppies, pleased
with everything and everybody, utterly oblivious to the sombre
repose brooding above the tea-table.</p>

<p>Their sister calmly refused them the use of her cigarettes. Eileen
presented her pretty shoulder, Rena nearly yawned at them, but,
nothing dampened, they recounted a number of incidents with reciprocal
enthusiasm to Sylvia, who was too inattentive to smile, and to
Grace Ferrall, who smiled the more sweetly through sheer inattention.</p>

<p>Then Alderdene came in, blinking a greeting through his foggy
goggles, sloppy, baggy, heavy shoes wheezing, lingered in the
vicinity long enough to swallow his "peg" and acquire a disdainful
opinion of his shooting from Marion, and then took himself off,
leaving the room noisy with his laugh, which resembled the rattle
of a startled kingfisher.</p>

<p>In ones and twos the guests reported as the dusk-curtained fog
closed in on Shotover. Quarrier came, dry as a chip under his
rain-coat, but his silky beard was wet with rain, and moisture
powdered his long, soft eyelashes and white skin; and his flexible,
pointed fingers, as he drew off his gloves, seemed startling in
their whiteness through the gathering gloom.</p>

<p>"I suppose our evening walk is out of the question," he said,
standing by Sylvia, who had nodded a greeting and then turned
her head rather hastily to see who had entered the room. It was
Siward, only a vague shape in the gloom, but perfectly recognisable
to her. At the same moment Marion Page rose leisurely and strolled
toward the billiard-room.</p>

<p>"Our walk?" repeated Sylvia absently&mdash;"it's raining, you know."
Yet only a day or two ago she had walked to church with Siward
through the rain, the irritated Major feeling obliged to go with
them. Her eyes followed Siward's figure, suddenly dark against
the door of the lighted billiard-room, then brilliantly illuminated,
as he entered, nodded acceptance to Mortimer's invitation, and
picked up the cue just laid aside by Agatha Caithness, who had
turned to speak to Marion. Then Mortimer's bulk loomed nearer;
voices became gay and animated in the billiard-room. Siward's
handsome face was bent toward Agatha Caithness in gay challenge;
Mortimer's heavy laugh broke out; there came the rattle of pool-balls,
and the dull sound of cue-butts striking the floor; then, crack!
and the game began, with Marion Page and Siward fighting Mortimer
and Miss Caithness for something or other.</p>

<p>Quarrier had been speaking for some time before Sylvia became
aware of it&mdash;something about a brisk walk in the morning somewhere;
and she nodded impatiently, watching Marion's supple waist-line
as she bent far over the illuminated table for a complicated shot
at the enemy.</p>

<p>His fiancée's inattention was not agreeable to Quarrier. A dozen
things had happened since his arrival which had not been agreeable
to him: her failure to meet him at the Fells Crossing, and the
reason for her failure; and her informal acquaintance with Siward,
whose presence at Shotover he had not looked for, and her sudden
intimacy with the man he had never particularly liked, and whom
within six months he had come to detest and to avoid.</p>

<p>These things&mdash;the outrageous liberty Siward had permitted himself
in caricaturing him, the mortifying caprice of Sylvia for Siward
on the day of the Shotover cup-drive&mdash;had left indelible impressions
in a cold and rather heavy mind, slow to waste effort in the indulgence
of any vital emotion.</p>

<p>In a few years indifference to Siward had changed to passive
disapproval; that, again, to an emotionless dislike; and when
the scandal at the Patroons Club occurred, for the first time
in his life he understood what it was to fear the man he disliked.
For if Siward had committed the insane imprudence which had cost
him his title to membership, he had also done something, knowingly
or otherwise, which awoke in Quarrier a cold, slow fear; and that
fear was dormant, but present, now, and it, for the time being,
dictated his attitude and bearing toward the man who might or
might not be capable of using viciously a knowledge which Quarrier
believed that he must possess.</p>

<p>For that reason, when it was not possible to avoid Siward, his
bearing toward him was carefully civil; for that reason he dampened
Major Belwether's eagerness to tell everybody all he knew about
the shamelessly imprudent girl who had figured with Siward in
the scandal, but whose identity the press had not discovered.</p>

<p>Silence was always desirable to Quarrier; silence concerning
all matters was a trait inborn and congenially cultivated to a
habit by him in every affair of life&mdash;in business, in leisure,
in the methodical pursuits of such pleasures as a limited intellect
permitted him, in personal and family matters, in public questions
and financial problems.</p>

<p>He listened always, but never invited confidences; he had no
opinion to express when invited. And he became very, very rich.</p>

<p>And over it all spread a thin membrane of vanity, nervous, not
intellectual, sensitiveness; for all sense of humour was absent
in this man, whose smile, when not a physical effort, was automatically
and methodically responsive to certain fixed cues. He smiled when
he said "Good morning," when declining or accepting invitations,
when taking his leave, when meeting anybody of any financial importance,
and when everybody except himself had begun to laugh in a theatre
or a drawing-room. This limit to any personal manifestation he
considered a generous one. And perhaps it was.</p>

<p>A sudden rain-squall, noisy against the casements, had darkened
the room; then the electric lights broke out with a mild candle-like
lustre, and Quarrier, standing beside Sylvia's chair, discovered
it to be empty.</p>

<p>It was not until he had dressed for dinner that he saw her again,
seated on the stairs with Marion Page&mdash;a new appearance of intimacy
for both women, who heretofore had found nothing except a passing
civility in common.</p>

<p>Marion was discussing dog-breeding with that cool, crude, direct
insouciance so unpleasant to some men. Sylvia was attentive, curious,
and instinctively shrinking by turns, secretly dismayed at the
overplainness of terms employed in kennel lore by the girl at
her side.</p>

<p>The conversation veered toward the Sagamore pup. Marion explained
that Siward was too busy to do any Southern shooting, which was
why he was glad to have her polish Sagamore on Jersey woodcock.</p>

<p>"I thought it was not good for a dog to be used by anybody except
his master," said Sylvia carelessly.</p>

<p>"Only second-raters suffer. Besides, I have shot enough, now,
with Mr. Siward to use his dog as he does."</p>

<p>"He is an agreeable shooting companion, smiled Sylvia.</p>

<p>"He is perfect," answered Marion coolly. "The only test for a
thoroughbred is the field. He rings true."</p>

<p>They exchanged carefully impersonal views on Siward's good qualities
for a moment or two; then Marion said bluntly: "Do you know anything
in particular about that Patroons Club affair?"</p>

<p>"No," said Sylvia, "nothing in particular."</p>

<p>"Neither do I; and I don't care to; I mean, that I don't care
what he did; and I wish that gossiping old Major would stop trying
to hint it to me."</p>

<p>"My uncle!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I forgot. Beg your pardon, you know, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not offended," observed Sylvia, with a shrug of her pretty,
bare shoulders.</p>

<p>Marion laughed. "Such a gadabout! Besides, I'm no prude, but
he and Leroy Mortimer have no business to talk to unmarried women
the way they do. No matter how worldly wise we are, men have no
right to suppose we are."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" shrugged Sylvia. "I have no patience to study out double-entendre,
so it never shocks me. Besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was going to add that she was not at all versed in doubtful
worldly wisdom, but decided not to, as it might seem to imply
disapproval of Marion's learning. So she went on: "Besides, what
have innuendoes to do with Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I care to understand them. The Major hinted
that the woman&mdash;the one who figured in it&mdash;is&mdash;rather exclusively
Mr. Siward's 'property.'"</p>

<p>"Exclusively?" repeated Sylvia curiously. "She's a public actress,
isn't she?"</p>

<p>"If you call the manoeuvres of a newly fledged chorus girl acting,
yes, she is. But I don't believe Mr. Siward figures in that unfashionable
rôle. Why, there are too many women of his own sort ready for
mischief."  Marion turned to Sylvia, her eyes hard with a cynicism
quite lost on the other. "That sort of thing might suit Leroy
Mortimer, but it doesn't fit Mr. Siward," she concluded, rising
as their hostess appeared from above and the butler from below.</p>

<p>And all through dinner an indefinitely unpleasant remembrance
of the conversation lingered with Sylvia, and she sat silent for
minutes at a time, returning to actualities with a long, curious
side-glance across at Siward, and an uncomprehending smile of
assent for whatever Quarrier or Major Belwether had been saying
to her.</p>

<p>Cards she managed to avoid after dinner, and stood by Quarrier's
chair for half an hour, absently watching the relentless method
and steady adherence to rule which characterised his Bridge-playing,
the eager, unslaked brutality of Mortimer, the set, selfish face
of his pretty wife, the chilled intensity of Miss Caithness.</p>

<p>And Grace Ferrall's phrase recurred to her, "Nobody ever has
enough money!"&mdash;not even these people, whose only worry was to
find investment for the surplus they were unable to spend. Something
of the meanness of it all penetrated her. Were these the real
visages of these people, whose faces otherwise seemed so smooth
and human? Was Leila Mortimer aware of the shrillness of her voice?
Did Agatha Caithness realise how pinched her mouth and nose had
grown? Did even Leroy Mortimer dream how swollen the pouches under
his eyes were; how red and puffy his hands, shuffling a new pack;
how pendulous and dreadful his red under-lip when absorbedly making
up his cards?</p>

<p>Instinctively she moved a step forward for a glimpse of Quarrier's
face. The face appeared to be a study in blankness. His natural
visage was emotionless and inexpressive enough, but this face,
from which every vestige of colour had fled, fascinated her with
its dead whiteness; and the hair brushed high, the long, black
lashes, the silky beard, struck her as absolutely ghastly, as
though they had been glued to a face of wax.</p>

<p>She turned on her heel, restless, depressed, inclined for companionship.
The Page boys had tempted Rena and Eileen to the billiard-room;
Voucher, Alderdene, and Major Belwether were huddled over a table,
immersed in Preference; Katharyn Tassel and Grace Ferrall sat
together looking over the announcements of Sylvia's engagement
in a batch of New York papers just arrived; Ferrall was writing
at a desk, and Siward and Marion were occupied in the former's
sketch for an ideal shooting vehicle, to be built on the buckboard
principle, with a clever arrangement for dogs, guns, ammunition,
and provisions. Siward's profile, as it bent in the lamplight
over the paper, was very engaging. The boyish note predominated
as he talked while he drew, his eyes now smiling, now seriously
intent on the sketch which was developing so swiftly under his
facile pencil.</p>

<p>Marion's clean-cut blond head was close to his, her supple body
twisted in her seat, one bare arm hanging over the back of the
chair. Something in her attitude seemed to exclude intrusion;
her voice, too, was hushed in comment, though his was pitched
in his naturally agreeable key.</p>

<p>Sylvia had taken a hesitating step toward them, but halted, turning
irresolutely; and suddenly over her crept a sensation of isolation&mdash;something
of that feeling which had roused her at midnight from her bed
and driven her to Grace Ferrall for a refuge from she knew not
what.</p>

<p>The rustle of her silken dinner gown was scarcely perceptible
as she turned. Siward, moving his head slightly, glanced up, then
brought his sketch to a brilliant finish.</p>

<p>"Don't you think something of this sort is practicable?" he asked
pleasantly, including Mrs. Ferrall and Katharyn Tassel in a general
appeal which brought them into the circle of two. Grace Ferrall
leaned forward, looking over Marion's shoulder, and Siward rose
and stepped back, with a quick glance into the hall&mdash;in time to
catch a glimmer of pale blue and lace on the stairs.</p>

<p>"I suppose my cigarettes are in my room as usual," he said aloud
to himself, wheeling so that he could not have time to see Marion's
offer of her little gold-encrusted case, or notice her quickly
raised eyes, bright with suspicion and vexation. For she, too,
had observed Sylvia's distant entrance, had been perfectly aware
of Siward's cognizance of Sylvia's retreat; and when Siward went
on sketching she had been content. Now she could not tell whether
he had deliberately and skillfully taken his congé to follow Sylvia,
or whether, in his quest for his cigarettes, chance might meddle,
as usual. Even if he returned, she could not know with certainty
how much of a part hazard had played on the landing above, where
she already heard the distant sounds of Sylvia's voice mingling
with Siward's, then a light footfall or two, and silence.</p>

<p>He had greeted her in his usual careless, happy fashion, just
as she had reached her chamber door; and she turned at the sound
of his voice, confused, unsmiling, a little pale.</p>

<p>"Is it headache, or are you too in quest of cigarettes?" he asked,
as he stopped in passing her where she stood, one slender hand
on the knob of her door.</p>

<p>"I don't smoke, you know," she said, looking up at him with a
cool little laugh. "It isn't headache either. I was&mdash;boring myself,
Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>"Is there any virtue in me as a remedy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have no doubt you have lots of virtues. … Perhaps you
might do as a temporary remedy&mdash;first aid to the injured." She
laughed again, uncertainly. "But you are on a quest for cigarettes."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"A rendezvous&mdash;with the Sand-Man. … Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night … if you must say it."</p>

<p>"It's polite to say something … isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It would be polite to say, 'With pleasure, Mr. Siward!'"</p>

<p>"But you haven't invited me to do anything&mdash;not even to accept
a cigarette. Besides, you didn't expect to meet me up here?"</p>

<p>The trailing accent made it near enough a question for him to
say, "Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"How could you?"</p>

<p>"I saw you leave the room."</p>

<p>"You were sketching for Marion Page. Do you wish me to believe
that you noticed me&mdash;"</p>

<p>" &mdash;And followed you? Yes, I did follow you." She looked
at him, then past him toward a corner of the wide hall where a
maid in cap and apron sat pretending to be sewing. "Careful!"
she motioned with smiling lips, "servants gossip. … Good night,
again."</p>

<p>"Won't you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! you mustn't speak so loud," she motioned, with her
fresh, sweet lips curving on the edge of that adorable smile once
more.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we have a moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! I must open my door"&mdash;lingering. "I might come out again,
if you have anything particularly important to communicate to
me."</p>

<p>"I have. There's a big bay-window at the end of the other corridor.
Will you come?"</p>

<p>But she opened her door, with a light laugh, saying "good night"
again, and closed it noiselessly behind her.</p>

<p>He walked on, turning into his corridor, but kept straight ahead,
passing his own door, on to the window at the end of the hall,
then north along a wide passageway which terminated in a bay-window
overlooking the roof of the indoor swimming tank.</p>

<p>Rain rattled heavily, against the panes and on the lighted roof
of opalescent glass below, through which he could make out the
shadowy fronds of palms.</p>

<p>It appeared that he had cigarettes enough, for he lighted one
presently, and, leaving his chair, curled up in the cushioned
and pillowed window-seat, gathering his knees together under his
arm.</p>

<p>The cigarette he had lighted went out. He had bitten into it
and twisted it so roughly that it presently crumbled; and he threw
the rags of it into a metal bowl, locking his jaws in silence.
For the night threatened to be a bad one for him. A heavy fragrance
from his neighbour's wine-glass at dinner had stirred up what
had for a time lain dormant; and, by accident, something&mdash;some
sweetmeat he had tasted&mdash;was saturated in brandy.</p>

<p>Now, his restlessness at the prospect of a blank night had quickened
to uneasiness, with a hint of fever tinting his skin, but, as
yet, the dull ache in his body was scarcely more than a premonition.</p>

<p>He had his own devices for tiding him over such periods&mdash;reading,
tobacco, and the long, blind, dogged tramps he took in town. But
here, to-night, in the rain, one stood every chance of walking
off the cliffs; and he was sick of reading himself sightless over
the sort of books sent wholesale to Shotover; and he was already
too ill at ease, physically, to make smoking endurable.</p>

<p>Were it not for a half-defiant, half-sullen dread of the coming
night, he might have put it from his mind in spite of the slowly
increasing nervous tension and the steady dull consciousness of
desire. He drew another Sirdar from his case and sat staring at
the rain-smeared night, twisting the frail fragrant cigarette
to bits between his fingers.</p>

<p>After a while he began to walk monotonously to and fro the length
of the corridor, like a man timing his steps to the heavy ache
of body or mind. Once he went as far as his own door, entered,
and stepping to the wash-basin, let the icy water run over hands
and wrists. This sometimes helped to stimulate and soothe him;
it did now, for a while&mdash;long enough to change the current of
his thoughts to the girl he had hoped might have the imprudence
to return for a tryst, innocent enough in itself, yet unconventional
and unreasonable enough to prove attractive to them both.</p>

<p>Probably she wouldn't come; she had kept her fluffy skirts clear
of him since Cup Day&mdash;which simply corroborated his vague estimate
of her. Had she done the contrary, his estimate would have been
the same; for, unconsciously but naturally, he had prejudged her.
A girl who could capture Quarrier at full noontide, and in the
face of all Manhattan, was a girl equipped for anything she dared&mdash;though
she was probably too clever to dare too much; a girl to be interested
in, to amuse and be amused by; a girl to be reckoned with. His
restlessness and his fever subdued by the icy water, he stood
drying his hands, thinking, coolly, how close he had come to being
seriously in love with this young girl, whose attitude was always
a curious temptation, whose smile was a charming provocation,
whose youth and beauty were to him a perpetual challenge. He admitted
to himself, calmly, that he had never seen a woman he cared as
much for; that for the brief moment of his declaration he had
known an utterly new emotion, which inevitably must have become
the love he had so quietly declared it to be. He had never before
felt as he felt then, cared as he cared then. Anything had been
possible for him at that time&mdash;any degree of love, any devotion,
any generous renunciation. Clear-sighted, master of himself, he
saw love before him, and knew it when he saw it; recognised it,
was ready for it, offered it, emboldened by her soft hands so
eloquent in his.</p>

<p>And in his arms he held it for an instant, he thought, spite
of the sudden inertia, spite of the according of cold lips and
hands still colder, relaxed, inert; held it until he doubted.
That was all; he had been wise to doubt such sudden miracles as
that. She, consummate and charming, had soon set him right. And,
after all, she liked him; and she had been sure enough of herself
to permit the impulse of a moment to carry her with him&mdash;a little
way, a very little way&mdash;merely to the formal symbol of a passion
the germ of which she recognised in him.</p>

<p>Then she had become intelligent again, with a little laughter,
a little malice, a becoming tint of hesitation and confusion;
all the sense, all the arts, all the friendly sweetness of a woman
thorough in training, schooled in self-possession, clear enough
to be audacious and perverse without danger to herself, to the
man, or to the main chance.</p>

<p>Standing there alone in his lighted room, he wondered whether,
had her trained and inbred policy been less precise, less worldly,
she might have responded to such a man as he. Perfectly conscious
that he had been capable of loving her; aware, too, that his experience
had left him on that borderland only through his cool refusal
to cross it and face a hopeless battle already lost, he leisurely
and mentally took the measure of his own state of mind, and found
all well, all intact; found himself still master of his affections,
and probably clear-minded enough to remain so under the circumstances.</p>

<p>To such a man as he, impulse to love, capacity to love, did not
mean instant capsizing with a flop into sentimental tempests,
where swamped, ardent and callow youth raises a hysterically selfish
clamour for reciprocity or death. His nature partly, partly his
character, accounted for this balance; and, in part, a rather
wide experience with women of various degrees counted more.</p>

<p>So, by instinct and experience, normally temperate, only what
was abnormal and inherited might work a mischief in this man.
His listlessness, his easy acquiescence, were but consequent upon
the self-knowledge of self-control. But mastery of the master-vice
required something different; he was sick of a sickness; and because,
in this sickness, will, mind, and body are tainted too, reason
and logic lack clarity; and, to the signals of danger his reply
had always been either overconfident or weak&mdash;and it had been
always the same reply: "Not yet. There is time." And now, this
last week, it had come upon him that the time was now; the skirmish
was already on; and it had alarmed him suddenly to find that the
skirmish was already a battle, and a rough one.</p>

<p>As he stood there he heard voices on the stairs. People had already
begun to retire, because late cards and point-shooting at dawn
do not agree. And a point-shooting picnic in snugly elaborate
blinds was popular with women&mdash;or was supposed to be.</p>

<p>He could distinguish by their voices, by their laughter and step,
the people who were mounting the stairway and lingering for gossip
or passing through the various corridors to court the sleep denied
him; he heard Mortimer's heavy tread and the soft shuffling step
of Major Belwether as they left the elevator; and the patter of
his hostess's satin slippers, and her gay "good night" on the
stairs.</p>

<p>Little by little the tumult died away. Quarrier's measured step
came, passed; Marion Page's cool, crisp voice and walk, and the
giggle and amble of the twins, and Rena and Eileen,&mdash;the last
laggards, with Ferrall's brisk, decisive tones and stride to close
the procession.</p>

<p>He turned and looked grimly at his bed, then, shutting off the
lights, he opened his door and went out into the deserted corridor,
where the elevator shaft was dark and only the dim night-lights
burned at angles in the passageways.</p>

<p>He had his rain-coat and cap with him, not being certain of what
he might be driven to; but for the present he found the bay-window
overlooking the swimming tank sufficient to begin the vigil.</p>

<p>Secure from intrusion, as there were no bedrooms on that corridor,
he tossed coat and cap into the window-seat, walked to and fro
for a while listening to the rain, then sat down, his well-shaped
head between his hands. And in silence he faced the Enemy.</p>

<p>How long he had sat there he did not know. When he raised his
face, all gray and drawn with the tension of conflict, his eyes
were not very clear, nor did the figure standing there in the
dim light from the hall mean anything for a moment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward?" in an uncertain voice, almost a whisper.</p>

<p>He stood up mechanically, and she saw his face.</p>

<p>"Are you ill? What is it?"</p>

<p>"Ill? No." He passed his hand over his eyes. "I fancy I was close
to the edge of sleep." Some colour came back into his face; he
stood smiling now, the significance of her presence dawning on
him.</p>

<p>"Did you really come?" he asked. "This isn't a very lovely but
impalpable astral vision, is it?"</p>

<p>"It's horridly imprudent, isn't it?" she murmured, still considering
the rather drawn and pallid face of the man before her. "I came
out of pure curiosity, Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>She glanced about her. He moved a big bunch of hothouse roses
so she could pass, and she settled down lightly on the edge of
the window-seat. When he had piled some big downy cushions behind
her back, she made a quick gesture of invitation.</p>

<p>"I have only a moment," she said, as he seated himself beside
her. "Part of my curiosity is satisfied in finding you here; I
didn't suppose you so faithful."</p>

<p>"I can be fairly faithful. What else are you curious about?"</p>

<p>"You said you had something important&mdash;"</p>

<p>" &mdash;To tell you? So I did. That was bribery, perjury, false
pretences, robbery under arms, anything you will! I only wanted
you to come."</p>

<p>"That is a shameful confession!" she said; but her smile was
gay enough, and she noiselessly shook out her fluffy skirts and
settled herself a trifle more deeply among the pillows.</p>

<p>"Of course," she observed absently, "you are dreadfully mortified
at yourself."</p>

<p>"Naturally," he admitted.</p>

<p>The patter of the rain attracted her attention; she peered out
through the blurred casements into the blackness. Then, picking
up his cap and indicating his raincoat, "Why?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;in case you hadn't come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A walk? By yourself? A night like this on the cliffs! You are
not perfectly mad, are you?"</p>

<p>"Not perfectly."</p>

<p>Her face grew serious and beautiful.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"Things."</p>

<p>"Do you care to be more explicit?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, with a humourous glance at her, "I haven't seen
you for ages. That's not wholesome for me, you know."</p>

<p>"But you see me now; and it does not seem to benefit you."</p>

<p>"I feel much better," he insisted, laughing; and her blue eyes
grew very lovely as the smile broke from them in uncertain response.</p>

<p>"So you had nothing really important to tell me, Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"Only that I wanted you."</p>

<p>"Oh! … I said important."</p>

<p>But he did not argue the question; and she leaned forward, broke
a rose from its stem, then sank back a little way among the cushions,
looking at him, idly inhaling the hothouse perfume.</p>

<p>"Why have you so ostentatiously avoided me, Mr. Siward?" she
asked languidly.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word!" he said, with a touch of irritation.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are so dreadfully literal!" she shrugged, brushing her
straight, sensitive nose with the pink blossom; "I only said it
to give you a chance. … If you are going to be stupid, good night!"
But she made no movement to go. … "Yes, then; I have avoided you.
And it doesn't become you to ask why."</p>

<p>"Because I kissed you?"</p>

<p>"You hint at the true reason so chivalrously, so delicately,"
she said, "that I scarcely recognise it." The cool mockery of
her voice and the warm, quick colour tinting neck and face were
incongruous. He thought with slow surprise that she was not yet
letter-perfect in her rôle of the material triumphant over the
spiritual. A trifle ashamed, too, he sat silent, watching the
silken petals fall one by one as she slowly detached them with
delicate, restless lips.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I came," she said reflectively. "You don't know why
I came, do you? Sheer loneliness, Mr. Siward; there is something
of the child in me still, you see. I am not yet sufficiently resourceful
to take it out in a quietly tearful obligato; I never learned
how to produce tears. … So I came to you." She had stripped the
petals from the rose, and now, tossing the crushed branch from
her, she leaned forward and broke from its stem a heavy, perfumed
bud, half unfolded.</p>

<p>"It seems my fate to pass my life in bidding you good night,"
she said, straightening up and turning to him with the careless
laughter touching mouth and eyes again. Then, resting her weight
on one hand, her smooth, white shoulder rounded beside her cheek,
she looked at him out of humourous eyes:</p>

<p>"What is it that women find so attractive in you? The man's experienced
insouciance? The boy's unconscious cynicism? The mystery of your
self-sufficiency? The faulty humanity in you? The youth in you
already showing traces of wear that hint of future scars? What
will you be at thirty-five? At forty? … Ah," she added softly,
"what are you now? For I don't know, and you cannot tell me if
you would. … Out of these little windows called eyes we look at
one another, and study surfaces, and try to peep into neighbours'
windows. But all is dark behind the windows&mdash;always dark, in there
where they tell us souls hide."</p>

<p>She laid the shell-pink bud against her cheek that matched it,
smiling with wise sweetness to herself.</p>

<p>"What counts with you?" he asked after a moment.</p>

<p>"Counts? How?"</p>

<p>"In your affections. What prepossesses you?"</p>

<p>She laughed audaciously: "Your traits&mdash;some of them&mdash;all of them
that you reveal. You must be aware of that much already, considering
everything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, what is it I lack? Where do I fail?"</p>

<p>"But you don't lack&mdash;you don't fail! I ask nothing more of you,
Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>"A man from whom a woman desires nothing is already convicted
of insufficiency. … You would recognise this very quickly if I
made love to you."</p>

<p>"Is that the only way I am to discover your insufficiency, Mr.
Siward?"</p>

<p>"Or my sufficiency. … Have you enough curiosity to try?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought you were to try." Then, quickly: "But I think
you have already experimented; and I did not notice your shortcomings.
So there is no use in pursuing that line of investigation any
farther&mdash;is there?"</p>

<p>And always with her the mischief lay in the trailing upward inflection;
in the confused sweetness of her eyes, and their lovely uncertainty.</p>

<p>One slim white hand held the rose against her cheek; the other
lay idly on her knee, fresh and delicate as a fallen petal; and
he laid both hands over it and lifted it between them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward, I am afraid this is becoming a habit with you."
The gay mockery was not quite genuine; the curve of lips too sensitive
for a voice so lightly cynical.</p>

<p>He smiled, bending there, considering her hand between his; and
after a moment her muscles relaxed, and bare round arm and hand
lay abandoned to him.</p>

<p>"Quite flawless&mdash;perfect," he said aloud to himself.</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;read hands?"</p>

<p>"Vaguely." He touched the smooth palm: "Long life, clear mind,
and"&mdash;he laughed&mdash;"heart supreme over reason! There is written
a white lie&mdash;but a pretty one."</p>

<p>"It is no lie."</p>

<p>He laughed again, unconvinced.</p>

<p>"It is the truth," she said, seriously insisting and bending
sideways above her own hand where it lay in his. "It is a miserable
confession to admit it, but I'm afraid intelligence would fight
a losing battle with heart if the conflict ever came. You see,
I know, having nobody to study except myself all these years.
… There is the proof of it&mdash;that selfish, smooth contour, where
there should be generosity. Then, look at the tendency of imagination
toward mischief!" She laid her right forefinger on the palm of
the left hand which he held, and traced the developments arising
in the Mount of Hermes. "Is it not a horrid hand, Mr. Siward?
I don't know how much you know about palms, but&mdash;" She suddenly
flushed, and attempted to close her hand, doubling the thumb over.
There was a little half-hearted struggle, freeing one of his arms,
which fell, settling about her slender waist; a silence, a breathless
moment, and he had kissed her. Her lips were warm, this time.</p>

<p>She recovered herself, avoiding his eyes, and moved backward,
shielding her face with pretty upflung elbows out-turned. "I told
you it was becoming a habit with you!" The loud beating of her
pulses marred her voice. "Must I establish a dead-line every time
I commit the folly of being alone with you?"</p>

<p>"I'll draw that line," he said, taking her in his arms.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I beg you will draw it quickly, Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>"I do; it passes through your heart and mine!"</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;do you mean a declaration&mdash;again? You are compromising yourself,
you know. I warn you that you are committing yourself."</p>

<p>"So are you. Look at me!"</p>

<p>In his arms, her own arms pressed against his breast, resisting,
she raised her splendid youthful eyes; and through and through
her shot pulse on pulse, until every nerve seemed aquiver.</p>

<p>"While I'm still sane," he said with a dry catch in his throat,
"before I tell you that I love you, look at me."</p>

<p>"I will, if you wish," she said with a trembling smile, "but
it is useless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is what I shall find out in time. … You must meet my eyes.
That is well; that is frank and sweet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And useless&mdash;truly it is. … Please don't tell me&mdash;anything."</p>

<p>"You will not listen?"</p>

<p>"There is no chance for you&mdash;if you mean love. I &mdash;I tell
you in time, you see. … I am utterly frivolous&mdash;quite selfish
and mercenary."</p>

<p>"I take my chance!"</p>

<p>"No, I give you none! Why do you interfere! <em>A&mdash;</em>a girl's
policy costs her something if it be worth anything; whatever it
costs it is worth it to me. … And I do not love you. In so short
a time how could I?"</p>

<p>Then in his arms she fell a-trembling. Something blinded her
eyes, and she turned her head sharply, only to encounter his lips
on hers in a deep, clinging embrace that left her dazed, still
resisting with the fragments of breath and voice.</p>

<p>"Not again &mdash;I beg&mdash;you. Let me go now. It is not best.
Oh! truly, truly it is all wrong with us now." She bent her head,
blinded with tears, swaying, stunned; then, with a breathless
sound, turned in his arms to meet his lips, her hands contracting
in his; and, confronting, they paused, suspending the crisis,
young faces close, and hearts afire.</p>

<p>"Sylvia, I love you."</p>

<p>For an instant their lips clung; she had rendered him his kiss.
Then, tremblingly, "It is useless … even though I loved you."</p>

<p>"Say it!"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Say it!"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I cannot! … And it is no use&mdash;no use! I do not know
myself&mdash;this way. My eyes&mdash;are wet. It is not like me; there is
nothing of me in this girl you hold so closely, so confidently.
… I do care for you&mdash;how can I help it? How could any woman help
it? Is not that enough?"</p>

<p>"Until you are a bride, yes."</p>

<p>"A bride? Stephen! &mdash;I cannot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You cannot help it, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"I must! I have my way to go."</p>

<p>"My way lies that way."</p>

<p>"No! no! I cannot do it; it is not best for me&mdash;not best for
you. … I do care for you; you have taught me how to say it. But&mdash;you
know what I have done&mdash;and mean to do, and must carry through.
Then, how can you love a girl like that?"</p>

<p>"Dear, I know the woman I love."</p>

<p>"Silly, she is what her life has made her&mdash;material, passionately
selfish, unable to renounce the root of all evil. … Even if this&mdash;this
happiness were ours always &mdash;I mean, if this madness could
last our wedded life &mdash;I am not good enough, not noble enough,
to forget what I might have had, and put away. … Is it not dreadful
to admit it? Do you not know that self-contempt is part of the
price? … I have no money. I know what you have. … I asked. And
it is enough for a man who remains unmarried. … For I cannot 'make
things do'; I cannot 'contrive'; I will not cling to the fringe
of things, or play that heartbreaking rôle of the shabby expatriated
on the Continent. … No person in this world ever had enough. I
tell you I could find use for every flake of metal ever mined!
… You see you do not know me. From my pretty face and figure you
misjudge me. I am intelligent&mdash;not intellectual, though I might
have been, might even be yet. I am cultivated, not learned; though
I care for learning&mdash;or might, if I had time. … My rôle in life
is to mount to a security too high for any question as to my dominance.
… Can you take me there?"</p>

<p>"There are other heights, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"Higher?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"The spiritual; I know. I could not breathe there, if I cared
to climb. … And I have told you what I am&mdash;all silk and lace and
smooth-skinned selfishness." She looked at him wistfully. "If
you can change me, take me." And she rose, facing him.</p>

<p>"I do not give you up," he said, with a savage note hardening
his voice; and it thrilled her to hear it, and every drop of blood
in her body leaped as she yielded to his arms again, heavy-lidded,
trembling, confused, under the piercing sweetness of contact.</p>

<p>The perfume of her mouth, her hair, the consenting fingers locked
in his, palm against palm, the lips, acquiescent, then afire at
last, responsive to his own; and her eyes opening from the dream
under the white lids&mdash;these were what he had of her till every
vein in him pulsed flame. Then her voice, broken, breathless:</p>

<p>"Good night. Love me while you can&mdash;and forgive me! … Good night.
… Where are we? All&mdash;all this must have stunned me, blinded me.
… Is this my door, or yours? Hush! I am half dead with fear&mdash;to
be here under the light again. … If you take me again, my knees
will give way. … And I must find my door. Oh, the ghastly imprudence
of it! … Good night … good night. I &mdash;I love you!"</p>
