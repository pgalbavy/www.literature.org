<p>Geronimo, as every reader of these pages knows, has been a "good
Indian" for many years. He makes his home among civilized people,
has acted as usher at the dedication of a schoolhouse and believes
in education. No fault can be found with the old chieftain in
these times, but only a few years ago, he was the most terrible
scourge of the southwest border.</p>

<p>The outrages committed by him and his desperadoes are matters
of history, as are the hardships and sufferings undergone by our
soldiers in their desperate efforts to run him to earth. There
was a universal sigh of relief among the ranches and settlements
of Arizona, when it became known of a certainty that Geronimo
and his principal associates had been taken eastward and would
never again be permitted to place foot west of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>We are writing of the trying period preceding the capture of
this Apache, when the mention of his name caused an involuntary
shudder on the part of the bravest man.</p>

<p>Mendez had given such incontestible proof of his astonishing
power of vision, that when he handed back the fieldglass and announced
that the Indian, a mile away, was that ferocious chieftain no
one doubted him.</p>

<p>The lieutenant passed the instrument to Cemuri with the request
that he would make use of it. The fellow hesitated but did as
desired. A moment after he pointed the glass westward, the Indian,
as if aware of his own recklessness, sank down until as in the
case of his companions, only the top of his head and forehead
was visible.</p>

<p>But the second scout secured a good view the moment before this
took place.</p>

<p>"Mendez right—he Geronimo," remarked Cemuri, as if that being
settled no further interest attached to their arch enemy.</p>

<p>"Since that is the case, it is probable that his whole band is
with him. If I had the rest of the boys at hand, we would sail
in and hustle those bucks westward faster than they came eastward."</p>

<p>"But you haven’t them at hand," observed Freeman, "so there isn’t
much chance of doing anything against the party."</p>

<p>Having "located" Geronimo and his band, the next question for
the lieutenant to decide was what should be done. Brave as was
the young officer (and his companions were equally brave) it would
have been madness to attack a company of Apaches, fully armed
and on the warpath, and who outnumbered them four or five to one.</p>

<p>Those cunning warriors were at home in this sandy waste and nothing
would have pleased them better than to be assailed. No doubt they
were keeping well out of sight in the hope of drawing on the little
company of horsemen, who, had they ridden over the ridge, as there
seemed a likelihood of their doing, would have entered a trap
from which there was no extrication.</p>

<p>"We must make connection with some of the boys who are scouting,"
remarked the lieutenant; "then when we are strong enough we’ll
give Geronimo a tussle. If it should be my good fortune to wipe
him out what a feather it would be in my cap!"</p>

<p>"And if it should be his bad fortune to wipe <em>you</em> out,"
suggested Freeman; "where would be your feather?"</p>

<p>Decker shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Honors that are not hardly earned are not honors. We’ll ride
to the right, and see whether we cannot gain a better sight of
them. It may be that this is only a part of the main band, and
if so we’ll have a fight."</p>

<p>The scheme seemed to be the only one feasible and was followed.
The clear sunshiny afternoon was drawing to a close and nothing
could be hoped for, in holding their motionless position in the
midst of the low, valley-like depression.</p>

<p>The young officer struck his horse to a moderate gallop, with
Freeman at his side and the scouts following closely at the rear,
grim, silent and watchful. The hostiles whose heads had been showing
above the ridge vanished from sight and there was no saying what
their course of action would be.</p>

<p>Had not the contour of the country been favorable, there would
have been an imprudent risk in the course of Lieutenant Decker;
for it is evident that it would have been easy for the hostiles
to shift their position along the ridge so as still to confront
the whites who would have ridden into the trap that has already
been described.</p>

<p>But a comparatively short distance to the right, the moderate
elevation sloped down to the level of the plain, permitting a
view of the winding stream which further to the left passed out
of sight behind the ridge. The Apaches could not advance upon
this without being observed, though (so wonderful is their cunning)
had they been given more time, they would have formed an ambush,
where neither wood nor elevation gave screen or protection. It
would not have been the first time that members of that tribe
have performed this seemingly impossible feat.</p>

<p>The promptness of the four horsemen prevented such a trap. They
swung forward at a swift gallop, until the ridge was flanked and
their position admitted a view of both sides for a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>The result was interesting. Four warriors were in plain view,
all mounted on their tough ponies and facing the white men and
scouts. A space of a fourth of a mile separated the parties, when
they thus confronted each other.</p>

<p>The Apaches immediately began tantalizing the whites, in the
hope of inducing them to attack. They swung their blankets aloft,
shouted, and Geronimo, riding out a short distance from his companions,
deliberately fired his rifle at the horsemen. He had a good weapon,
for the singing of the bullet was heard as it passed over the
heads of his enemies.</p>

<p>"I can be as polite as you," remarked Lieutenant Decker, bringing
his Winchester to his shoulder and letting fly.</p>

<p>He aimed at the chieftain, and nothing would have delighted him
more than to see him pitch from the back of his pony, but the
distance was too great to make the aim accurate and the leader
suffered no more harm than had his enemies at his hands.</p>

<p>"Mendez," said the young officer, turning to his principal scout;
"do you think it likely there are only four of the Apaches? If
such is your belief we’ll charge them."</p>

<p>The sagacious scout grimly shook his head.</p>

<p>"More—plenty more—hide in sand—want us to fight ’em."</p>

<p>"But where are their ponies?"</p>

<p>"Hide ’em easy—lay down—cover ’em wid sand—go in water—only nose
stick out."</p>

<p>Nothing would have pleased Geronimo more than to be attacked.
In his broken English he called out taunts so insulting that the
swarthy cheek of Lieutenant Decker flushed. How he would have
leaped at the chance of a fight with him on anything like equal
terms!</p>

<p>The chieftain now rode his pony more than a hundred yards in
a straight line toward the group. His animal walked slowly and
his rider continued to shout his taunts.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker, holding his horse well in hand, advanced the
same distance toward Geronimo.</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do?" sternly asked Freeman.</p>

<p>"I’ll take care of myself," was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>"I don’t know whether you will or not," added Freeman, with no
little misgiving.</p>

<p>Decker continued his guarded advance until like his enemy, he
judged he had gone far enough, when he too halted.</p>

<p>"I’ll go as far as he dare," he muttered; "if he will only come
far enough to be beyond the support of his men, I’ll meet him
and we can have it out between us."</p>

<p>Geronimo had ceased his taunting shouts, and, with his horse
perfectly motionless sat like an equestrian statue with his gaze
upon this young David. Then he did a singular thing.</p>

<p>All four, while watching him, discovered that instead of holding
his pony stationary, as at first, he was backing him. The well-trained
animal, keeping his nose toward the foe, was stepping slowly backward,
the movement of his legs and the change of position being clearly
seen by all.</p>

<p>Mendez and Cemuri looked at each other and smiled; they knew
what it meant. Geronimo was seeking to lure the young officer
away from his supports, or, better still, striving to tempt forward
the whole four, under the belief that the two forces were equal.</p>

<p>"Don’t go any nearer!" called Freeman, growing impatient with
the recklessness of the officer; "he’s trying to draw you on."</p>

<p>The lieutenant made no reply. His spirited horse, of his own
volition, took two steps forward, but his rider checked him.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Geronimo, but the fly isn’t ready to walk into the
spider’s web."</p>

<p>Seeing the failure of his scheme, the Apache chief, with the
quickness of a flash, raised his Winchester again and fired directly
at the officer, whose escape was quite narrow, for the interval
admitted of a fatal shot, provided it were well aimed.</p>

<p>As if to imitate every action of his enemy, Decker brought his
rifle to a level and sighted carefully at Geronimo. It required
no phenomenal marksmanship to bring him down, and he was hopeful
of doing so, but at the moment of pressing the trigger, the chieftain
disappeared as if by magic.</p>

<p>He knew what was coming and saw his danger. He flung himself
over the side of his pony, whose body was thus interposed as a
shield. Not to be baffled, the officer sighted as best he could
and fired.</p>

<p>He did not harm the chieftain, but the bullet passed through
the brain of his pony, who, with a cry of agony, reared on his
hind legs, pawed the air and rolled over as dead as Julius Cæsar.
His agile rider, who had no saddle, leaped free and ran hastily
back to his companions, amid the jeering shouts of the youth who
had unhorsed him.</p>

<p>"Geronimo is a squaw! He runs from the white man! He dare not
come forward and fight him! He is afraid he will be hurt!"</p>

<p>All which, if it were so, did not change the situation or give
any additional advantage to him who uttered the taunts.</p>
