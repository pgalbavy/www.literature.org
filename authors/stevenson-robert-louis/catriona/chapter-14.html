<p>I had no thought where they were taking me; only looked here
and there for the appearance of a ship; and there ran the while
in my head a word of Ransome’s—the_ twenty-pounders_. If I were
to be exposed a second time to that same former danger of the
plantations, I judged it must turn ill with me; there was no second
Alan; and no second shipwreck and spare yard to be expected now;
and I saw myself hoe tobacco under the whip’s lash. The thought
chilled me; the air was sharp upon the water, the stretchers of
the boat drenched with a cold dew: and I shivered in my place
beside the steersman. This was the dark man whom I have called
hitherto the Lowlander; his name was Dale, ordinarily called Black
Andie. Feeling the thrill of my shiver, he very kindly handed
me a rough jacket full of fish-scales, with which I was glad to
cover myself.</p>

<p>"I thank you for this kindness," said I, "and will make so free
as to repay it with a warning. You take a high responsibility
in this affair. You are not like these ignorant, barbarous Highlanders,
but know what the law is and the risks of those that break it."</p>

<p>"I am no just exactly what ye would ca’ an extremist for the
law," says he, "at the best of times; but in this business I act
with a good warranty."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nae harm," said he, "nae harm ava’. Ye’ll have strong freens,
I’m thinking. Ye’ll be richt eneuch yet."</p>

<p>There began to fall a greyness on the face of the sea; little
dabs of pink and red, like coals of slow fire, came in the east;
and at the same time the geese awakened, and began crying about
the top of the Bass. It is just the one crag of rock, as everybody
knows, but great enough to carve a city from. The sea was extremely
little, but there went a hollow plowter round the base of it.
With the growing of the dawn I could see it clearer and clearer;
the straight crags painted with sea-birds’ droppings like a morning
frost, the sloping top of it green with grass, the clan of white
geese that cried about the sides, and the black, broken buildings
of the prison sitting close on the sea’s edge.</p>

<p>At the sight the truth came in upon me in a clap.</p>

<p>"It’s there you’re taking me!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Just to the Bass, mannie," said he: "Whaur the auld saints were
afore ye, and I misdoubt if ye have come so fairly by your preeson."</p>

<p>"But none dwells there now," I cried; "the place is long a ruin."</p>

<p>"It’ll be the mair pleisand a change for the solan geese, then,"
quoth Andie dryly.</p>

<p>The day coming slowly brighter I observed on the bilge, among
the big stones with which fisherfolk ballast their boats, several
kegs and baskets, and a provision of fuel. All these were discharged
upon the crag. Andie, myself, and my three Highlanders (I call
them mine, although it was the other way about), landed along
with them. The sun was not yet up when the boat moved away again,
the noise of the oars on the thole-pins echoing from the cliffs,
and left us in our singular reclusion:</p>

<p>Andie Dale was the Prefect (as I would jocularly call him) of
the Bass, being at once the shepherd and the gamekeeper of that
small and rich estate. He had to mind the dozen or so of sheep
that fed and fattened on the grass of the sloping part of it,
like beasts grazing the roof of a cathedral. He had charge besides
of the solan geese that roosted in the crags; and from these an
extraordinary income is derived. The young are dainty eating,
as much as two shillings a-piece being a common price, and paid
willingly by epicures; even the grown birds are valuable for their
oil and feathers; and a part of the minister’s stipend of North
Berwick is paid to this day in solan geese, which makes it (in
some folks’ eyes) a parish to be coveted. To perform these several
businesses, as well as to protect the geese from poachers, Andie
had frequent occasion to sleep and pass days together on the crag;
and we found the man at home there like a farmer in his steading.
Bidding us all shoulder some of the packages, a matter in which
I made haste to bear a hand, he led us in by a locked gate, which
was the only admission to the island, and through the ruins of
the fortress, to the governor’s house. There we saw by the ashes
in the chimney and a standing bed-place in one corner, that he
made his usual occupation.</p>

<p>This bed he now offered me to use, saying he supposed I would
set up to be gentry.</p>

<p>"My gentrice has nothing to do with where I lie," said I. "I
bless God I have lain hard ere now, and can do the same again
with thankfulness. While I am here, Mr. Andie, if that be your
name, I will do my part and take my place beside the rest of you;
and I ask you on the other hand to spare me your mockery, which
I own I like ill."</p>

<p>He grumbled a little at this speech, but seemed upon reflection
to approve it. Indeed, he was a long-headed, sensible man, and
a good Whig and Presbyterian; read daily in a pocket Bible, and
was both able and eager to converse seriously on religion, leaning
more than a little towards the Cameronian extremes. His morals
were of a more doubtful colour. I found he was deep in the free
trade, and used the ruins of Tantallon for a magazine of smuggled
merchandise. As for a gauger, I do not believe he valued the life
of one at half-a-farthing. But that part of the coast of Lothian
is to this day as wild a place, and the commons there as rough
a crew, as any in Scotland.</p>

<p>One incident of my imprisonment is made memorable by a consequence
it had long after. There was a warship at this time stationed
in the Firth, the <em>Seahorse</em>, Captain Palliser. It chanced
she was cruising in the month of September, plying between Fife
and Lothian, and sounding for sunk dangers. Early one fine morning
she was seen about two miles to east of us, where she lowered
a boat, and seemed to examine the Wildfire Rocks and Satan’s Bush,
famous dangers of that coast. And presently after having got her
boat again, she came before the wind and was headed directly for
the Bass. This was very troublesome to Andie and the Highlanders;
the whole business of my sequestration was designed for privacy,
and here, with a navy captain perhaps blundering ashore, it looked
to become public enough, if it were nothing worse. I was in a
minority of one, I am no Alan to fall upon so many, and I was
far from sure that a warship was the least likely to improve my
condition. All which considered, I gave Andie my parole of good
behaviour and obedience, and was had briskly to the summit of
the rock, where we all lay down, at the cliff’s edge, in different
places of observation and concealment. The <em>Seahorse</em> came
straight on till I thought she would have struck, and we (looking
giddily down) could see the ship’s company at their quarters and
hear the leadsman singing at the lead. Then she suddenly wore
and let fly a volley of I know not how many great guns. The rock
was shaken with the thunder of the sound, the smoke flowed over
our heads, and the geese rose in number beyond computation or
belief. To hear their screaming and to see the twinkling of their
wings, made a most inimitable curiosity; and I suppose it was
after this somewhat childish pleasure that Captain Palliser had
come so near the Bass. He was to pay dear for it in time. During
his approach I had the opportunity to make a remark upon the rigging
of that ship by which I ever after knew it miles away; and this
was a means (under Providence) of my averting from a friend a
great calamity, and inflicting on Captain Palliser himself a sensible
disappointment.</p>

<p>All the time of my stay on the rock we lived well. We had small
ale and brandy, and oatmeal, of which we made our porridge night
and morning. At times a boat came from the Castleton and brought
us a quarter of mutton, for the sheep upon the rock we must not
touch, these being specially fed to market. The geese were unfortunately
out of season, and we let them be. We fished ourselves, and yet
more often made the geese to fish for us: observing one when he
had made a capture and scaring him from his prey ere he had swallowed
it.</p>

<p>The strange nature of this place, and the curiosities with which
it abounded, held me busy and amused. Escape being impossible,
I was allowed my entire liberty, and continually explored the
surface of the isle wherever it might support the foot of man.
The old garden of the prison was still to be observed, with flowers
and pot-herbs running wild, and some ripe cherries on a bush.
A little lower stood a chapel or a hermit’s cell; who built or
dwelt in it, none may know, and the thought of its age made a
ground of many meditations. The prison, too, where I now bivouacked
with Highland cattle-thieves, was a place full of history, both
human and divine. I thought it strange so many saints and martyrs
should have gone by there so recently, and left not so much as
a leaf out of their Bibles, or a name carved upon the wall, while
the rough soldier lads that mounted guard upon the battlements
had filled the neighbourhood with their mementoes—broken tobacco-pipes
for the most part, and that in a surprising plenty, but also metal
buttons from their coats. There were times when I thought I could
have heard the pious sound of psalms out of the martyr’s dungeons,
and seen the soldiers tramp the ramparts with their glinting pipes,
and the dawn rising behind them out of the North Sea.</p>

<p>No doubt it was a good deal Andie and his tales that put these
fancies in my head. He was extraordinarily well acquainted with
the story of the rock in all particulars, down to the names of
private soldiers, his father having served there in that same
capacity. He was gifted besides with a natural genius for narration,
so that the people seemed to speak and the things to be done before
your face. This gift of his and my assiduity to listen brought
us the more close together. I could not honestly deny but what
I liked him; I soon saw that he liked me; and indeed, from the
first I had set myself out to capture his good-will. An odd circumstance
(to be told presently) effected this beyond my expectation; but
even in early days we made a friendly pair to be a prisoner and
his gaoler.</p>

<p>I should trifle with my conscience if I pretended my stay upon
the Bass was wholly disagreeable. It seemed to me a safe place,
as though I was escaped there out of my troubles. No harm was
to be offered me; a material impossibility, rock and the deep
sea, prevented me from fresh attempts; I felt I had my life safe
and my honour safe, and there were times when I allowed myself
to gloat on them like stolen waters. At other times my thoughts
were very different, I recalled how strong I had expressed myself
both to Rankeillor and to Stewart; I reflected that my captivity
upon the Bass, in view of a great part of the coasts of Fife and
Lothian, was a thing I should be thought more likely to have invented
than endured; and in the eyes of these two gentlemen, at least,
I must pass for a boaster and a coward. Now I would take this
lightly enough; tell myself that so long as I stood well with
Catriona Drummond, the opinion of the rest of man was but moonshine
and spilled water; and thence pass off into those meditations
of a lover which are so delightful to himself and must always
appear so surprisingly idle to a reader. But anon the fear would
take me otherwise; I would be shaken with a perfect panic of self-esteem,
and these supposed hard judgments appear an injustice impossible
to be supported. With that another train of thought would he presented,
and I had scarce begun to be concerned about men’s judgments of
myself, than I was haunted with the remembrance of James Stewart
in his dungeon and the lamentations of his wife. Then, indeed,
passion began to work in me; I could not forgive myself to sit
there idle: it seemed (if I were a man at all) that I could fly
or swim out of my place of safety; and it was in such humours
and to amuse my self-reproaches that I would set the more particularly
to win the good side of Andie Dale.</p>

<p>At last, when we two were alone on the summit of the rock on
a bright morning, I put in some hint about a bribe. He looked
at me, cast back his head, and laughed out loud.</p>

<p>"Ay, you’re funny, Mr. Dale," said I, "but perhaps if you’ll
glance an eye upon that paper you may change your note."</p>

<p>The stupid Highlanders had taken from me at the time of my seizure
nothing but hard money, and the paper I now showed Andie was an
acknowledgment from the British Linen Company for a considerable
sum.</p>

<p>He read it. "Troth, and ye’re nane sae ill aff," said he.</p>

<p>"I thought that would maybe vary your opinions," said I.</p>

<p>"Hout!" said he. "It shows me ye can bribe; but I’m no to be
bribit."</p>

<p>"We’ll see about that yet a while," says I. "And first, I’ll
show you that I know what I am talking. You have orders to detain
me here till after Thursday, 21st September."</p>

<p>"Ye’re no a’thegether wrong either," says Andie. "I’m to let
you gang, bar orders contrair, on Saturday, the 23rd."</p>

<p>I could not but feel there was something extremely insidious
in this arrangement. That I was to re-appear precisely in time
to be too late would cast the more discredit on my tale, if I
were minded to tell one; and this screwed me to fighting point.</p>

<p>"Now then, Andie, you that kens the world, listen to me, and
think while ye listen," said I. "I know there are great folks
in the business, and I make no doubt you have their names to go
upon. I have seen some of them myself since this affair began,
and said my say into their faces too. But what kind of a crime
would this be that I had committed? or what kind of a process
is this that I am fallen under? To be apprehended by some ragged
John-Hielandman on August 30th, carried to a rickle of old stones
that is now neither fort nor gaol (whatever it once was) but just
the gamekeeper’s lodge of the Bass Rock, and set free again, September
23rd, as secretly as I was first arrested—does that sound like
law to you? or does it sound like justice? or does it not sound
honestly like a piece of some low dirty intrigue, of which the
very folk that meddle with it are ashamed?"</p>

<p>"I canna gainsay ye, Shaws. It looks unco underhand," says Andie.
"And werenae the folk guid sound Whigs and true-blue Presbyterians
I would has seen them ayont Jordan and Jeroozlem or I would have
set hand to it."</p>

<p>"The Master of Lovat’ll be a braw Whig," says I, "and a grand
Presbyterian."</p>

<p>"I ken naething by him," said he. "I hae nae trokings wi’ Lovats."</p>

<p>"No, it’ll be Prestongrange that you’ll be dealing with," said
I.</p>

<p>"Ah, but I’ll no tell ye that," said Andie.</p>

<p>"Little need when I ken," was my retort.</p>

<p>"There’s just the ae thing ye can be fairly sure of, Shaws,"
says Andie. "And that is that (try as ye please) I’m no dealing
wi’ yoursel’; nor yet I amnae goin’ to," he added.</p>

<p>"Well, Andie, I see I’ll have to be speak out plain with you,"
I replied. And told him so much as I thought needful of the facts.</p>

<p>He heard me out with some serious interest, and when I had done,
seemed to consider a little with himself.</p>

<p>"Shaws," said he at last, "I’ll deal with the naked hand. It’s
a queer tale, and no very creditable, the way you tell it; and
I’m far frae minting that is other than the way that ye believe
it. As for yoursel’, ye seem to me rather a dacent-like young
man. But me, that’s aulder and mair judeecious, see perhaps a
wee bit further forrit in the job than what ye can dae. And here
the maitter clear and plain to ye. There’ll be nae skaith to yoursel’
if I keep ye here; far free that, I think ye’ll be a hantle better
by it. There’ll be nae skaith to the kintry—just ae mair Hielantman
hangit—Gude kens, a guid riddance! On the ither hand, it would
be considerable skaith to me if I would let you free. Sae, speakin’
as a guid Whig, an honest freen’ to you, and an anxious freen’
to my ainsel’, the plain fact is that I think ye’ll just have
to bide here wi’ Andie an’ the solans."</p>

<p>"Andie," said I, laying my hand upon his knee, "this Hielantman’s
innocent."</p>

<p>"Ay, it’s a peety about that," said he. "But ye see, in this
warld, the way God made it, we cannae just get a’thing that we
want."</p>
