<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Lord Coombe was ushered into the little drawing-room by an extremely
immature young footman who--doubtless as a consequence of his
immaturity--appeared upon the scene too suddenly. The War left one only
servants who were idiots or barely out of Board Schools, Feather said.
And in fact it was something suggesting "a scene" upon which Coombe was
announced. The athletic and personable young actor--entitled upon
programmes Owen Delamore--was striding to and fro talking excitedly.
There was theatrical emotion in the air and Feather, delicately flushed
and elate, was listening with an air half frightened, half pleased. The
immaturity of the footman immediately took fright and the youth turning
at once produced the fatal effect of fleeing precipitately.
</p>
<p>Mr. Owen Delamore suddenly ceased speaking and would doubtless have
flushed vividly if he had not already been so high of colour as to
preclude the possibility of his flushing at all. The scene, which was
plainly one of emotion, being intruded upon in its midst left him
transfixed on his expression of anguish, pleading and reproachful
protest--all thrilling and confusing things.
</p><p>The very serenity of Lord Coombe's apparently unobserving entrance was
perhaps a shock as well as a relief. It took even Feather two or three
seconds to break into her bell of a laugh as she shook hands with her
visitor.
</p><p>"Mr. Delamore is going over his big scene in the new play," she
explained with apt swiftness of resource. "It's very good, but it
excites him dreadfully. I've been told that great actors don't let
themselves get excited at all, so he ought not to do it, ought he, Lord
Coombe?"
</p><p>Coombe was transcendently well behaved.
</p><p>"I am a yawning abyss of ignorance in such matters, but I cannot agree
with the people who say that emotion can be expressed without feeling."
He himself expressed exteriorly merely intelligent consideration of the
idea. "That however may be solely the opinion of one benighted."
</p><p>It was so well done that the young athlete, in the relief of relaxed
nerves, was almost hysterically inclined to believe in Feather's adroit
statement and to feel that he really had been acting. He was at least
able to pull himself together, to become less flushed and to sit down
with some approach to an air of being lightly amused at himself.
</p><p>"Well it is proved that I am not a great actor," he achieved. "I can't
come anywhere near doing it. I don't believe Irving ever did--or
Coquelin. But perhaps it is one of my recommendations that I don't
aspire to be great. At any rate people only ask to be amused and helped
out just now. It will be a long time before they want anything else,
it's my opinion."
</p><p>They conversed amiably together for nearly a quarter of an hour before
Mr. Owen Delamore went on his way murmuring polite regrets concerning
impending rehearsals, his secret gratitude expressing itself in special
courtesy to Lord Coombe.
</p><p>As he was leaving the room, Feather called to him airily:
</p><p>"If you hear any more of the Zepps--just dash in and tell me!--Don't
lose a minute! Just dash!"
</p><p>When the front door was heard to close upon him, Coombe remarked
casually:
</p><p>"I will ask you to put an immediate stop to that sort of thing."
</p><p>He observed that Feather fluttered--though she had lightly moved to a
table as if to rearrange a flower in a group.
</p><p>"Put a stop to letting Mr. Delamore go over his scene here?"
</p><p>"Put a stop to Mr. Delamore, if you please."
</p><p>It was at this moment more than ever true that her light being was
overstrung and that her light head whirled too fast. This one particular
also overstrung young man had shared all her amusements with her and had
ended by pleasing her immensely--perhaps to the verge of inspiring a
touch of fevered sentiment she had previously never known. She told
herself that it was the War when she thought of it. She had however not
been clever enough to realise that she was a little losing her head in a
way which might not be to her advantage. For the moment she lost it
completely. She almost whirled around as she came to Coombe.
</p><p>"I won't," she exclaimed. "I won't!"
</p><p>It was a sort of shock to him. She had never done anything like it
before. It struck him that he had never before seen her look as she
looked at the moment. She was a shade too dazzlingly made up--she had
crossed the line on one side of which lies the art which is perfect.
Even her dress had a suggestion of wartime lack of restraint in its
style and colours.
</p><p>It was of a strange green and a very long scarf of an intensely vivid
violet spangled with silver paillettes was swathed around her bare
shoulders and floated from her arms. One of the signs of her excitement
was that she kept twisting its ends without knowing that she was
touching it. He noted that she wore a big purple amethyst ring--the
amethyst too big. Her very voice was less fine in its inflections and as
he swiftly took in these points Coombe recognised that they were the
actual result of the slight tone of raffishness he had observed as
denoting the character of her increasingly mixed circle.
</p><p>She threw herself into a chair palpitating in one of her rages of a
little cat--wreathing her scarf round and round her wrist and singularly
striking him with the effect of almost spitting and hissing out her
words.
</p><p>"I won't give up everything I like and that likes me," she flung out.
"The War has done something to us all. It's made us let ourselves go.
It's done something to me too. It's made me less frightened. I won't be
bullied into--into things."
</p><p>"Do I seem to bully you? I am sorry."
</p><p>The fact that she had let herself go with the rest of the world got the
better of her.
</p><p>"You have not been near me for weeks and now you turn up with your air
of a grand Bashawe and order people out of my house. You have not been
near me."
</p><p>The next instant it was as though she tore off some last shred of mental
veiling and threw it aside in her reckless mounting heat of temper.
</p><p>"Near me!" she laughed scathingly, "For the matter of that when have you
ever been <u>near</u> me? It's always been the same. I've known it for years.
As the Yankees say, you 'wouldn't touch me with a ten-foot pole.' I'm
sick of it. What did you <u>do</u> it for?"
</p><p>"Do what?"
</p><p>"Take possession of me as if I were your property. You never were in
love with me--never for a second. If you had been you'd have married
me."
</p><p>"Yes. I should have married you."
</p><p>"There was no reason why you should not. I was pretty. I was young. I'd
been decently brought up--and it would have settled everything. Why
<u>didn't</u> you instead of letting people think I was your mistress when I
didn't count for as much as a straw in your life?"
</p><p>"You represented more than that," he answered. "Kindly listen to me."
</p><p>That she had lost her head completely was sufficiently manifested by the
fact that she had begun to cry--which made it necessary for her to use
her handkerchief with inimitable skill to prevent the tears from
encroaching on her brilliant white and rose.
</p><p>"If you had been in love with me--" she chafed bitterly.
</p><p>"On the morning some years ago when I came to you I made myself clear to
the best of my ability," he said. "I did not mention love. I told you
that I had no intention of marrying you. I called your attention to what
the world would assume. I left the decision to you."
</p><p>"What could I do--without a penny? Some other man would have had to do
it if you had not," the letting go rushed her into saying.
</p><p>"Or you would have been obliged to return to your parents in
Jersey--which you refused to contemplate."
</p><p>"Of course I refused. It would have been mad to do it. And there were
other people who would have paid my bills."
</p><p>"Solely because I knew that, I made my proposition. Being much older
than you I realised that other people might not feel the responsibility
binding--and permanent."
</p><p>She sat up and stared at him. There was no touch of the rancour of
recrimination in his presentation of detached facts. He <u>was</u> different
from the rest. He was always better dressed and the perfection of his
impersonal manner belonged to a world being swept away. He made Mr. Owen
Delamore seem by contrast a bounder and an outsider. But the fact which
had in the secret places of her small mind been the fly in her
ointment--the one fact that he had never for a moment cared a straw for
her--caused her actually to hate him as he again made it, quite without
prejudice, crystal clear. It was true that he had more than kept his
word--that he had never broken a convention in his bearing towards
her--that in his rigid way he had behaved like a prince--but she had
been dirt under his feet--she had been dirt under his feet! She wanted
to rave like a fishwife--though there were no fishwives in Mayfair.
</p><p>It was at this very moment of climax that a sudden memory beset her.
</p><p>"Rob always said that if a woman who was pretty could see a man often
enough--again and again--he couldn't <u>help</u> himself--unless there <u>was</u>
some one else!"
</p><p>Her last words were fiercely accusing. She quite glared at him a few
seconds, her chest heaving pantingly.
</p><p>She suddenly sprang from her sofa and dashed towards a table where a
pile of photographs lay in an untidy little heap. She threw them about
with angrily shaking hands until at last she caught at one and brought
it back to him.
</p><p>"There <u>was</u> some one else," she laughed shrilly. "You were in love with
that creature."
</p><p>It was one of the photographs of Alixe such as the Bond Street shop had
shown in its windows.
</p><p>She made a movement as if to throw it into the grate and he took it from
her hand, saying nothing whatever.
</p><p>"I'd forgotten about it until Owen Delamore reminded me only yesterday,"
she said. "He's a romantic thing and he heard that you had been in
attendance and had been sent to their castle in Germany. He worked the
thing out in his own way. He said you had chosen me because I was like
her. I can see now! I <u>was</u> like her!"
</p><p>"If you had been like her," his voice was intensely bitter, "I should
have asked you to be my wife. You are as unlike her as one human being
can be to another."
</p><p>"But I was enough like her to make you take me up!" she cried furiously.
</p><p>"I have neither taken you up nor put you down," he answered. "Be good
enough never to refer to the subject again."
</p><p>"I'll refer to any subject I like. If you think I shall not you are
mistaken. It will be worth talking about. An Early Victorian romance is
worth something in these days."
</p><p>The trend of her new circle had indeed carried her far. He was privately
appalled by her. She was hysterically, passionately spiteful--almost to
the point of malignance.
</p><p>"Do you realise that this is a scene? It has not been our habit to
indulge in scenes," he said.
</p><p>"I shall speak about it as freely as I shall speak about Robin," she
flaunted at him, wholly unrestrained. "Do you think I know nothing about
Robin? I'm an affectionate mother and I've been making inquiries. She's
not with the Dowager at Eaton Square. She got ill and was sent away to
be hidden in the country. Girls are, sometimes. I thought she would be
sent away somewhere, the day I met her in the street. She looked
exactly like that sort of thing. Where is she? I demand to know."
</p><p>There is nothing so dangerous to others as the mere spitefully malignant
temper of an empty headed creature giving itself up to its own weak
fury. It knows no restraint, no limit in its folly. In her fantastic
broodings over her daughter's undue exaltation of position Feather had
many times invented for her own entertainment little scenes in which she
could score satisfactorily. Such scenes had always included Coombe, the
Dowager, Robin and Mrs. Muir.
</p><p>"I am her mother. She is not of age. I <u>can</u> demand to see her. I can
make her come home and stay with me while I see her through her
'trouble,' as pious people call it. She's got herself into trouble--just
like a housemaid. I knew she would--I warned her," and her laugh was
actually shrill.
</p><p>It was inevitable--and ghastly--that he should suddenly see Robin with
her white eyelids dropped over her basket of sewing by the window in the
Tower room at Darreuch. It rose as clear as a picture on a screen and he
felt sick with actual terror.
</p><p>"I'll go to the Duchess and ask her questions until she can't face me
without telling the truth. If she's nasty I'll talk to the War Work
people who crowd her house. They all saw Robin and the wide-awake ones
will understand when I'm maternal and tragic and insist on knowing. I'll
go to Mrs. Muir and talk to her. It will be fun to see her face and the
Duchess'."
</p><p>He had never suspected her of malice such as this. And even in the midst
of his ghastly dismay he saw that it was merely the malice of an angrily
spiteful selfish child of bad training and with no heart. There was
nothing to appeal to--nothing to arrest and control. She might repent
her insanity in a few days but for the period of her mood she would do
her senseless worst.
</p><p>"Your daughter has not done what you profess to believe," he said. "You
do not believe it. Will you tell me why you propose to do these things?"
</p><p>She had worked herself up to utter recklessness.
</p><p>"Because of <u>everything</u>," she spat forth. "Because I'm in a
rage--because I'm sick of her and her duchesses. And I'm most sick of
you hovering about her as if she were a princess of the blood and you
were her Grand Chamberlain. Why don't you marry her yourself--baby and
all! Then you'll be sure there'll be another Head of the House of
Coombe!"
</p><p>She knew then that she had raved like a fishwife--that, even though
there had before been no fishwives in Mayfair, he saw one standing
shrilling before him. It was in his eyes and she knew it before she had
finished speaking, for his look was maddening. It enraged her even
further and she shook in the air the hand with the big purple amethyst
ring, still clutching the end of the bedizened purple scarf. She was
intoxicated with triumph--for she had reached him.
</p><p>"I will! I will!" she cried. "I will--to-morrow!"
</p><p>"You will not!" his voice rang out as she had never heard it before. He
even took a step forward. Then came the hurried leap of feet up the
narrow staircase and Owen Delamore flung the door wide, panting:
</p><p>"You told me to dash in," he almost shouted. "They're coming! We can
rush round to the Sinclairs'. They're on the roof already!"
</p><p>She caught the purple scarf around her and ran towards him, for at this
new excitement her frenzy reached its highest note.
</p><p>"I will! I will!" she called back to Coombe as she fled out of the room
and she held up and waved at him again the hand with the big amethyst.
"I will, to-morrow!"
</p><hr/>
<p>Lord Coombe was left standing in the garish, crowded little drawing-room
listening to ominous sounds in the street--to cries, running feet and
men on fleeing bicycles shouting warnings as they sped at top speed and
strove to clear the way.
