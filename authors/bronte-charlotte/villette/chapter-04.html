<p>On quitting Bretton, which I did a few weeks after Paulina's
departure - little thinking then I was never again to visit it; never
more to tread its calm old streets - I betook myself home, having been
absent six months. It will be conjectured that I was of course glad to
return to the bosom of my kindred. Well! the amiable conjecture does
no harm, and may therefore be safely left uncontradicted. Far from
saying nay, indeed, I will permit the reader to picture me, for the
next eight years, as a bark slumbering through halcyon weather, in a
harbour still as glass - the steersman stretched on the little deck,
his face up to heaven, his eyes closed: buried, if you will, in a long
prayer. A great many women and girls are supposed to pass their lives
something in that fashion; why not I with the rest?</p>

<p>Picture me then idle, basking, plump, and happy, stretched on a
cushioned deck, warmed with constant sunshine, rocked by breezes
indolently soft. However, it cannot be concealed that, in that case, I
must somehow have fallen overboard, or that there must have been wreck
at last. I too well remember a time - a long time - of cold, of danger,
of contention. To this hour, when I have the nightmare, it repeats the
rush and saltness of briny waves in my throat, and their icy pressure
on my lungs. I even know there was a storm, and that not of one hour
nor one day. For many days and nights neither sun nor stars appeared;
we cast with our own hands the tackling out of the ship; a heavy
tempest lay on us; all hope that we should be saved was taken away. In
fine, the ship was lost, the crew perished.</p>

<p>As far as I recollect, I complained to no one about these troubles.
Indeed, to whom could I complain? Of Mrs. Bretton I had long lost
sight. Impediments, raised by others, had, years ago, come in the way
of our intercourse, and cut it off. Besides, time had brought changes
for her, too: the handsome property of which she was left guardian for
her son, and which had been chiefly invested in some joint-stock
undertaking, had melted, it was said, to a fraction of its original
amount. Graham, I learned from incidental rumours, had adopted a
profession; both he and his mother were gone from Bretton, and were
understood to be now in London. Thus, there remained no possibility of
dependence on others; to myself alone could I look. I know not that I
was of a self-reliant or active nature; but self-reliance and exertion
were forced upon me by circumstances, as they are upon thousands
besides; and when Miss Marchmont, a maiden lady of our neighbourhood,
sent for me, I obeyed her behest, in the hope that she might assign me
some task I could undertake.</p>

<p>Miss Marchmont was a woman of fortune, and lived in a handsome
residence; but she was a rheumatic cripple, impotent, foot and hand,
and had been so for twenty years. She always sat upstairs: her
drawing-room adjoined her bed-room. I had often heard of Miss
Marchmont, and of her peculiarities (she had the character of being
very eccentric), but till now had never seen her. I found her a
furrowed, grey-haired woman, grave with solitude, stern with long
affliction, irritable also, and perhaps exacting. It seemed that a
maid, or rather companion, who had waited on her for some years, was
about to be married; and she, hearing of my bereaved lot, had sent for
me, with the idea that I might supply this person's place. She made
the proposal to me after tea, as she and I sat alone by her fireside.</p>

<p>&quot;It will not be an easy life;&quot; said she candidly, &quot;for I require a
good deal of attention, and you will be much confined; yet, perhaps,
contrasted with the existence you have lately led, it may appear
tolerable.&quot;</p>

<p>I reflected. Of course it ought to appear tolerable, I argued
inwardly; but somehow, by some strange fatality, it would not. To live
here, in this close room, the watcher of suffering - sometimes,
perhaps, the butt of temper - through all that was to come of my youth;
while all that was gone had passed, to say the least, not blissfully!
My heart sunk one moment, then it revived; for though I forced myself
to <span style="text-decoration: underline">realise</span> evils, I think I was too prosaic to <span style="text-decoration: underline">idealise</span>,
and consequently to exaggerate them.</p>

<p>&quot;My doubt is whether I should have strength for the undertaking,&quot; I
observed.</p>

<p>&quot;That is my own scruple,&quot; said she; &quot;for you look a worn-out
creature.&quot;</p>

<p>So I did. I saw myself in the glass, in my mourning-dress, a faded,
hollow-eyed vision. Yet I thought little of the wan spectacle. The
blight, I believed, was chiefly external: I still felt life at life's
sources.</p>

<p>&quot;What else have you in view - anything?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing clear as yet: but I may find something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you imagine: perhaps you are right. Try your own method, then; and
if it does not succeed, test mine. The chance I have offered shall be
left open to you for three months.&quot;</p>

<p>This was kind. I told her so, and expressed my gratitude. While I was
speaking, a paroxysm of pain came on. I ministered to her; made the
necessary applications, according to her directions, and, by the time
she was relieved, a sort of intimacy was already formed between us. I,
for my part, had learned from the manner in which she bore this
attack, that she was a firm, patient woman (patient under physical
pain, though sometimes perhaps excitable under long mental canker);
and she, from the good-will with which I succoured her, discovered
that she could influence my sympathies (such as they were). She sent
for me the next day; for five or six successive days she claimed my
company. Closer acquaintance, while it developed both faults and
eccentricities, opened, at the same time, a view of a character I
could respect. Stern and even morose as she sometimes was, I could
wait on her and sit beside her with that calm which always blesses us
when we are sensible that our manners, presence, contact, please and
soothe the persons we serve. Even when she scolded me - which she did,
now and then, very tartly - it was in such a way as did not humiliate,
and left no sting; it was rather like an irascible mother rating her
daughter, than a harsh mistress lecturing a dependant: lecture,
indeed, she could not, though she could occasionally storm. Moreover,
a vein of reason ever ran through her passion: she was logical even
when fierce. Ere long a growing sense of attachment began to present
the thought of staying with her as companion in quite a new light; in
another week I had agreed to remain.</p>

<p>Two hot, close rooms thus became my world; and a crippled old woman,
my mistress, my friend, my all. Her service was my duty - her pain, my
suffering - her relief, my hope - her anger, my punishment - her regard,
my reward. I forgot that there were fields, woods, rivers, seas, an
ever-changing sky outside the steam-dimmed lattice of this sick
chamber; I was almost content to forget it. All within me became
narrowed to my lot. Tame and still by habit, disciplined by destiny, I
demanded no walks in the fresh air; my appetite needed no more than
the tiny messes served for the invalid. In addition, she gave me the
originality of her character to study: the steadiness of her virtues,
I will add, the power of her passions, to admire; the truth of her
feelings to trust. All these things she had, and for these things I
clung to her.</p>

<p>For these things I would have crawled on with her for twenty years, if
for twenty years longer her life of endurance had been protracted. But
another decree was written. It seemed I must be stimulated into
action. I must be goaded, driven, stung, forced to energy. My little
morsel of human affection, which I prized as if it were a solid pearl,
must melt in my fingers and slip thence like a dissolving hailstone.
My small adopted duty must be snatched from my easily contented
conscience. I had wanted to compromise with Fate: to escape occasional
great agonies by submitting to a whole life of privation and small
pains. Fate would not so be pacified; nor would Providence sanction
this shrinking sloth and cowardly indolence.</p>

<p>One February night - I remember it well - there came a voice near Miss
Marchmont's house, heard by every inmate, but translated, perhaps,
only by one. After a calm winter, storms were ushering in the spring.
I had put Miss Marchmont to bed; I sat at the fireside sewing. The
wind was wailing at the windows; it had wailed all day; but, as night
deepened, it took a new tone - an accent keen, piercing, almost
articulate to the ear; a plaint, piteous and disconsolate to the
nerves, trilled in every gust.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, hush! hush!&quot; I said in my disturbed mind, dropping my work, and
making a vain effort to stop my ears against that subtle, searching
cry. I had heard that very voice ere this, and compulsory observation
had forced on me a theory as to what it boded. Three times in the
course of my life, events had taught me that these strange accents in
the storm - this restless, hopeless cry - denote a coming state of the
atmosphere unpropitious to life. Epidemic diseases, I believed, were
often heralded by a gasping, sobbing, tormented, long-lamenting east
wind. Hence, I inferred, arose the legend of the Banshee. I fancied,
too, I had noticed - but was not philosopher enough to know whether
there was any connection between the circumstances - that we often at
the same time hear of disturbed volcanic action in distant parts of
the world; of rivers suddenly rushing above their banks; and of
strange high tides flowing furiously in on low sea-coasts. &quot;Our
globe,&quot; I had said to myself, &quot;seems at such periods torn and
disordered; the feeble amongst us wither in her distempered breath,
rushing hot from steaming volcanoes.&quot;</p>

<p>I listened and trembled; Miss Marchmont slept.</p>

<p>About midnight, the storm in one half-hour fell to a dead calm. The
fire, which had been burning dead, glowed up vividly. I felt the air
change, and become keen. Raising blind and curtain, I looked out, and
saw in the stars the keen sparkle of a sharp frost.</p>

<p>Turning away, the object that met my eyes was Miss Marchmont awake,
lifting her head from the pillow, and regarding me with unusual
earnestness.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it a fine night?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>I replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought so,&quot; she said; &quot;for I feel so strong, so well. Raise me. I
feel young to-night,&quot; she continued: &quot;young, light-hearted, and happy.
What if my complaint be about to take a turn, and I am yet destined to
enjoy health? It would be a miracle!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And these are not the days of miracles,&quot; I thought to myself, and
wondered to hear her talk so. She went on directing her conversation
to the past, and seeming to recall its incidents, scenes, and
personages, with singular vividness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love Memory to-night,&quot; she said: &quot;I prize her as my best friend.
She is just now giving me a deep delight: she is bringing back to my
heart, in warm and beautiful life, realities - not mere empty ideas,
but what were once realities, and that I long have thought decayed,
dissolved, mixed in with grave-mould. I possess just now the hours,
the thoughts, the hopes of my youth. I renew the love of my life - its
only love - almost its only affection; for I am not a particularly good
woman: I am not amiable. Yet I have had my feelings, strong and
concentrated; and these feelings had their object; which, in its
single self, was dear to me, as to the majority of men and women, are
all the unnumbered points on which they dissipate their regard. While
I loved, and while I was loved, what an existence I enjoyed! What a
glorious year I can recall - how bright it comes back to me! What a
living spring - what a warm, glad summer - what soft moonlight,
silvering the autumn evenings - what strength of hope under the ice-
bound waters and frost-hoar fields of that year's winter! Through that
year my heart lived with Frank's heart. O my noble Frank - my faithful
Frank - my <span style="text-decoration: underline">good</span> Frank! so much better than myself - his standard
in all things so much higher! This I can now see and say: if few women
have suffered as I did in his loss, few have enjoyed what I did in his
love. It was a far better kind of love than common; I had no doubts
about it or him: it was such a love as honoured, protected, and
elevated, no less than it gladdened her to whom it was given. Let me
now ask, just at this moment, when my mind is so strangely clear, - let
me reflect why it was taken from me? For what crime was I condemned,
after twelve months of bliss, to undergo thirty years of sorrow?</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know,&quot; she continued after a pause: &quot;I cannot - <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot</span>
see the reason; yet at this hour I can say with sincerity, what I
never tried to say before, Inscrutable God, Thy will be done! And at
this moment I can believe that death will restore me to Frank. I never
believed it till now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is dead, then?&quot; I inquired in a low voice.</p>

<p>&quot;My dear girl,&quot; she said, &quot;one happy Christmas Eve I dressed and
decorated myself, expecting my lover, very soon to be my husband,
would come that night to visit me. I sat down to wait. Once more I see
that moment - I see the snow twilight stealing through the window over
which the curtain was not dropped, for I designed to watch him ride up
the white walk; I see and feel the soft firelight warming me, playing
on my silk dress, and fitfully showing me my own young figure in a
glass. I see the moon of a calm winter night, float full, clear, and
cold, over the inky mass of shrubbery, and the silvered turf of my
grounds. I wait, with some impatience in my pulse, but no doubt in my
breast. The flames had died in the fire, but it was a bright mass yet;
the moon was mounting high, but she was still visible from the
lattice; the clock neared ten; he rarely tarried later than this, but
once or twice he had been delayed so long.</p>

<p>&quot;Would he for once fail me? No - not even for once; and now he was
coming - and coming fast-to atone for lost time. 'Frank! you furious
rider,' I said inwardly, listening gladly, yet anxiously, to his
approaching gallop, 'you shall be rebuked for this: I will tell you it
is <span style="text-decoration: underline">my</span> neck you are putting in peril; for whatever is yours is,
in a dearer and tenderer sense, mine.' There he was: I saw him; but I
think tears were in my eyes, my sight was so confused. I saw the
horse; I heard it stamp - I saw at least a mass; I heard a clamour.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Was</span> it a horse? or what heavy, dragging thing was it, crossing,
strangely dark, the lawn. How could I name that thing in the moonlight
before me? or how could I utter the feeling which rose in my soul?</p>

<p>&quot;I could only run out. A great animal - truly, Frank's black horse - 
stood trembling, panting, snorting before the door; a man held it
Frank, as I thought.</p>

<p>&quot;'What is the matter?' I demanded. Thomas, my own servant, answered by
saying sharply, 'Go into the house, madam.' And then calling to
another servant, who came hurrying from the kitchen as if summoned by
some instinct, 'Ruth, take missis into the house directly.' But I was
kneeling down in the snow, beside something that lay there - something
that I had seen dragged along the ground - something that sighed, that
groaned on my breast, as I lifted and drew it to ms. He was not dead;
he was not quite unconscious. I had him carried in; I refused to be
ordered about and thrust from him. I was quite collected enough, not
only to be my own mistress but the mistress of others. They had begun
by trying to treat me like a child, as they always do with people
struck by God's hand; but I gave place to none except the surgeon; and
when he had done what he could, I took my dying Frank to myself. He
had strength to fold me in his arms; he had power to speak my name; he
heard me as I prayed over him very softly; he felt me as I tenderly
and fondly comforted him.</p>

<p>&quot;'Maria,' he said, 'I am dying in Paradise.' He spent his last breath
in faithful words for me. When the dawn of Christmas morning broke, my
Frank was with God.</p>

<p>&quot;And that,&quot; she went on, &quot;happened thirty years ago. I have suffered
since. I doubt if I have made the best use of all my calamities. Soft,
amiable natures they would have refined to saintliness; of strong,
evil spirits they would have made demons; as for me, I have only been
a woe-struck and selfish woman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have done much good,&quot; I said; for she was noted for her liberal
almsgiving.</p>

<p>&quot;I have not withheld money, you mean, where it could assuage
affliction. What of that? It cost me no effort or pang to give. But I
think from this day I am about to enter a better frame of mind, to
prepare myself for reunion with Frank. You see I still think of Frank
more than of God; and unless it be counted that in thus loving the
creature so much, so long, and so exclusively, I have not at least
blasphemed the Creator, small is my chance of salvation. What do you
think, Lucy, of these things? Be my chaplain, and tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>This question I could not answer: I had no words. It seemed as if she
thought I <span style="text-decoration: underline">had</span> answered it.</p>

<p>&quot;Very right, my child. We should acknowledge God merciful, but not
always for us comprehensible. We should accept our own lot, whatever
it be, and try to render happy that of others. Should we not? Well,
to-morrow I will begin by trying to make you happy. I will endeavour
to do something for you, Lucy: something that will benefit you when I
am dead. My head aches now with talking too much; still I am happy. Go
to bed. The clock strikes two. How late you sit up; or rather how late
I, in my selfishness, keep you up. But go now; have no more anxiety
for me; I feel I shall rest well.&quot;</p>

<p>She composed herself as if to slumber. I, too, retired to my crib in a
closet within her room. The night passed in quietness; quietly her
doom must at last have come: peacefully and painlessly: in the morning
she was found without life, nearly cold, but all calm and undisturbed.
Her previous excitement of spirits and change of mood had been the
prelude of a fit; one stroke sufficed to sever the thread of an
existence so long fretted by affliction.</p>
