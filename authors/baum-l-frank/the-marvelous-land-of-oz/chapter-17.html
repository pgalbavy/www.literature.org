<P>
When the adventurers reassembled upon the roof it was found that a
remarkably queer assortment of articles had been selected by the various
members of the party. No one seemed to have a very clear idea of what was
required, but all had brought something.
<P>
The Woggle-Bug had taken from its position over the mantle-piece in the
great hallway the head of a Gump, which was adorned with wide-spreading
antlers; and this, with great care and greater difficulty, the insect had
carried up the stairs to the roof. This Gump resembled an Elk's head, only
the nose turned upward in a saucy manner and there were whiskers
upon its chin, like those of a billy-goat. Why the Woggle-Bug selected this
article he could not have explained, except that it had aroused his
curiosity.
<P>
Tip, with the aid of the Saw-Horse, had brought a large, upholstered sofa to
the roof. It was an oldfashioned piece of furniture, with high back and
ends, and it was so heavy that even by resting the greatest weight upon the
back of the Saw-Horse, the boy found himself out of breath when at last the
clumsy sofa was dumped upon the roof.
<P>
The Pumpkinhead had brought a broom, which was the first thing he saw. The
Scarecrow arrived with a coil of clothes-lines and ropes which he had taken
from the courtyard, and in his trip up the stairs he had become so entangled
in the loose ends of the ropes that both he and his burden tumbled in a heap
upon the roof and might have rolled off if Tip had not rescued him.
<P>
The Tin Woodman appeared last. He also had been to the courtyard, where he
had cut four great, spreading leaves from a huge palm-tree that was the
pride of all the inhabitants of the Emerald City.
<P>
"My dear Nick!" exclaimed the Scarecrow, seeing what his friend had done;
"you have been guilty of the greatest crime any person can commit in the
Emerald City. If I remember rightly, the
penalty for chopping leaves from the royal palm-tree is to be killed seven
times and afterward imprisoned for life."
<P>
"It cannot be helped now" answered the Tin Woodman, throwing down the big
leaves upon the roof. "But it may be one more reason why it is necessary for
us to escape. And now let us see what you have found for me to work with."
<P>
Many were the doubtful looks cast upon the heap of miscellaneous material
that now cluttered the roof, and finally the Scarecrow shook his head and
remarked:
<P>
"Well, if friend Nick can manufacture, from this mess of rubbish, a Thing
that will fly through the air and carry us to safety, then I will
acknowledge him to be a better mechanic than I suspected."
<P>
But the Tin Woodman seemed at first by no means sure of his powers, and only
after polishing his forehead vigorously with the chamois-leather did he
resolve to undertake the task.
<P>
"The first thing required for the machine," said he, "is a body big enough
to carry the entire party. This sofa is the biggest thing we have, and might
be used for a body. But, should the machine ever tip sideways, we would all
slide off and fall to the ground."
<P>
"Why not use two sofas?" asked Tip. "There's another one just like this down
stairs."
<P>
"That is a very sensible suggestion," exclaimed the Tin Woodman. "You must
fetch the other sofa at once."
<P>
So Tip and the Saw-Horse managed, with much labor, to get the second sofa to
the roof; and when the two were placed together, edge to edge, the backs and
ends formed a protecting rampart all around the seats.
<P>
"Excellent!" cried the Scarecrow. "We can ride within this snug nest quite
at our ease."
<P>
The two sofas were now bound firmly together with ropes and clothes-lines,
and then Nick Chopper fastened the Gump's head to one end.
<P>
"That will show which is the front end of the Thing," said he, greatly
pleased with the idea." And, really, if you examine it critically, the Gump
looks very well as a figure-head. These great palm-leaves, for which I have
endangered my life seven times, must serve us as wings."
<P>
"Are they strong enough?" asked the boy.
<P>
"They are as strong as anything we can get," answered the Woodman; "and
although they are not in proportion to the Thing's body, we are not in a
position to be very particular."
<P>
So he fastened the palm-leaves to the sofas, two on each side.
<P>
Said the Woggle-Bug, with considerable admiration:
<P>
"The Thing is now complete, and only needs to be brought to life."
<P>
"Stop a moment!" exclaimed Jack." Are you not going to use my broom?"
<P>
"What for?" asked the Scarecrow.
<P>
"Why, it can be fastened to the back end for a tail," answered the
Pumpkinhead. "Surely you would not call the Thing complete without a tail."
<P>
"Hm!" said the Tin Woodman, "I do not see the use of a tail. We are not
trying to copy a beast, or a fish, or a bird. All we ask of the Thing is to
carry us through the air.
<P>
"Perhaps, after the Thing is brought to life, it can use a tail to steer
with," suggested the Scarecrow. "For if it flies through the air it will not
be unlike a bird, and I've noticed that all birds have tails, which they use
for a rudder while flying."
<P>
"Very well," answered Nick, "the broom shall be used for a tail," and he
fastened it firmly to the back end of the sofa body.
<P>
Tip took the pepper-box from his pocket.
<P>
"The Thing looks very big," said he, anxiously;
"and I am not sure there is enough powder left to bring all of it to life.
But I'll make it go as far as possible."
<P>
"Put most on the wings," said Nick Chopper; "for they must be made as strong
as possible."
<P>
"And don't forget the head!" exclaimed the Woggle-Bug.
<P>
"Or the tail!" added Jack Pumpkinhead.
<P>
"Do be quiet," said Tip, nervously; "you must give me a chance to work the
magic charm in the proper manner."
<P>
Very carefully he began sprinkling the Thing with the precious powder. Each
of the four wings was first lightly covered with a layer. then the sofas
were sprinkled, and the broom given a slight coating.
<P>
"The head! The head! Don't, I beg of you, forget the head!" cried the
Woggle-Bug, excitedly.
<P>
"There's only a little of the powder left," announced Tip, looking within
the box." And it seems to me it is more important to bring the legs of the
sofas to life than the head."
<P>
"Not so," decided the Scarecrow. "Every thing must have a head to direct it;
and since this creature is to fly, and not walk, it is really unimportant
whether its legs are alive or not."
<P>
So Tip abided by this decision and sprinkled the Gump's head with the
remainder of the powder.
<P>
"Now" said he, "keep silence while I work the, charm!"
<P>
Having heard old Mombi pronounce the magic words, and having also succeeded
in bringing the Saw-Horse to life, Tip did not hesitate an instant in
speaking the three cabalistic words, each accompanied by the peculiar
gesture of the hands.
<P>
It was a grave and impressive ceremony.
<P>
As he finished the incantation the Thing shuddered throughout its huge bulk,
the Gump gave the screeching cry that is familiar to those animals, and then
the four wings began flopping furiously.
<P>
Tip managed to grasp a chimney, else he would have been blown off the roof
by the terrible breeze raised by the wings. The Scarecrow, being light in
weight, was caught up bodily and borne through the air until Tip luckily
seized him by one leg and held him fast. The Woggle-Bug lay flat upon the
roof and so escaped harm,
and the Tin Woodman, whose weight of tin anchored him firmly, threw both
arms around Jack Pumpkinhead and managed to save him. The Saw-Horse toppled
over upon his back and lay with his legs waving helplessly above him.
<P>
And now, while all were struggling to recover themselves, the Thing rose
slowly from the roof and mounted into the air.
<P>
"Here! Come back!" cried Tip, in a frightened voice, as he clung to the
chimney with one hand and the Scarecrow with the other. "Come back at once,
I command you!"
<P>
It was now that the wisdom of the Scarecrow, in bringing the head of the
Thing to life instead of the legs, was proved beyond a doubt. For the Gump,
already high in the air, turned its head at Tip's command and gradually
circled around until it could view the roof of the palace.
<P>
"Come back!" shouted the boy, again.
<P>
And the Gump obeyed, slowly and gracefully waving its four wings in the air
until the Thing had settled once more upon the roof and become still.
