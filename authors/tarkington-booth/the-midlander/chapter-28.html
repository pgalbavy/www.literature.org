<p>HE <em>FOUND </em>Henry, but the search took two hours, and his
clothes were sodden with the rain that drenched them as he got
in and out of his car to make inquiries, or to investigate restaurants
of lively all-night reputations. The red "speedster" he had bought
for his son stood hub-deep in the running gutter before the last
of these to be reached; and when the father brought his boy out
of the place, and helped him into the Morgan limousine, Henry
protested in a whimper somewhat incoherent that he wanted to drive
his own car home;—he didn’t like to leave it out all night in
the rain he said.</p>

<p>"I guess it <em>has</em> stood where it is about long enough!"
Dan told him grimly. "But we’ll leave it there till I send a man
for it in the morning—to sell it, Henry."</p>

<p>Henry whimpered again; then recovered enough presence of mind
to say no more. When they reached home, he went upstairs as quickly
as he could, although once he had to employ the assistance of
the banister railing; and his father followed him.</p>

<p>A light still shone into the hall from the library door, and
Dan, whose face was pallid and startled, made his voice cheerful
as he called from the stairway: "It’s all right, mother. The boy’s
home and everything’s all right. Just a little foolishness with
his car; and I’ve decided it’ll be offered for sale to-morrow.
You go to bed now."</p>

<p>Henry went to his room and Dan was following him, when Lena,
wearing a bright kimono over her nightdress, made her appearance
in the open doorway of her bedroom. "What <em>is</em> all this?"
she asked petulantly.</p>

<p>"Never mind!"</p>

<p>"But I do mind! What are you saying about selling Henry’s car?
Didn’t I hear you say——"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did." Dan closed the door of Henry’s room and came
to her. "I made a terrible mistake to give it to him. We’ve both
made a mistake the way we’ve raised him. He’s a good boy; he’s
got a fine nature and a noble soul. But he’s got with bad companions.
He’s been——" He paused, and went on slowly, with difficulty: "He’s
been—he’s been drinkin’, Lena."</p>

<p>She said nothing, but stared at him blankly for a moment—then
the stare became an angry one.</p>

<p>"We’ve got to change our whole way of treatin’ Henry," her unhappy
husband told her. "We’ve been all wrong. He—he got with bad companions——"</p>

<p>"Yes," she interrupted angrily. "I should think he might, in
a town like this!"</p>

<p>"My Lord! It ain’t the <em>town’s</em> fault. For heaven’s sake,
don’t go back to that old story at a time like this!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," she said. "The time’s come when you’ve got to
let me take Henry and go where I want to."</p>

<p>Dan looked dazed. "Go where you want to? Why, where do you want
to go?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere I please!"</p>

<p>"But, my Lord! You were away seven months out of last year. You
only got back from Europe last October! What do you——"</p>

<p>"I want to go and I want to take Henry with me! What’s just happened
proves that I’m right. This is the wrong place for him."</p>

<p>"But I tell you the place hasn’t got anything on earth to do
with it."</p>

<p>"Hasn’t it?" she cried. "I tell you it has all to do with it,
just as it’s had all to do with me ever since I came here! I’ve
hated it every instant of all these silly, wasted years I’ve been
pent up here. And now it’s ruining my child—yes, ruining him—and
you want me still to stay here and let <em>him</em> stay here!
You want me to waste the rest of my life, and ruin my <em>child’s</em>
life, but I tell you, Dan Oliphant, you can’t make us <em>do</em>
it—not either of us! Not <em>either</em> of us, do you hear?"
She had become hysterical, and her voice was so wild and loud
that Mrs. Oliphant had come into the hall, downstairs, and was
calling up piteously to know what was the matter.</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> the matter, Dan, dear?" she called. "What <em>is</em>
the matter with Lena?"</p>

<p>But Lena, shrieking, "You can’t <em>make</em> us—you can’t <em>make</em>
us!" ran into her room and locked the door. It was a thick old
door, but she could still be heard, and it was not difficult to
understand that she had thrown herself upon her bed, and was there
convulsive, still shrieking: "You can’t <em>make</em> us! You
can’t <em>make</em> us! You can’t, you can’t, you <em>can’t</em>——" </p>
