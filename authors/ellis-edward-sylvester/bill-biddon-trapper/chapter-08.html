<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>One of the savages cast some wood upon the fire, and as it blazed
up, I saw that five of them stood around me. Resistance would
be useless, as my rifle, knife, and revolver were in their hands.
Their faces were devoid of paint, and they were probably a party
of hunters who had fallen upon my trail. I remembered my spectral
visitant a few hours before, and doubted not that he was the means
of the tedious captivity which had now only commenced.</p>

<p>After I had arisen to my feet, the captors continued conversing
in an unknown tongue. It perplexed me to understand how one of
them was able to address me in tolerably good English; but I supposed
he must have had intercourse with the fur traders and hunters
and the forts and stations of the northwest.</p>

<p>The debate of the Indians I judged to be a decision upon the
course they were to follow. Singularly enough, I had hardly any
fears at all in regard to my life, feeling pretty well convinced
that they intended an endless captivity for me. I doubted not
I should be adopted into their tribe, and doomed to the office
of the meanest slave. This was not a very encouraging prospect
it is true, but it was infinitely superior to that of death.</p>

<p>After a few minutes’ conversation, the Indians apparently came
to a satisfactory conclusion; for they seated themselves around
the fire, ordering me to do the same, and here they sat as grim
and silent as statues, not a muscle moving, excepting an occasional
wink of the eyes at long intervals. I watched them, it seemed
for an hour, shivering with cold all the time, although my captors
had not deprived me of my blanket.</p>

<p>At last, as I looked up, I saw that day was breaking. There was
a faint light in the east, heralding the approach of the sun.
Shortly after, it burst above the forest line, lighting up the
interminable prairie and wilderness with its golden glory. The
savages sprang to their feet, seized their weapons and started
away.</p>

<p>"Keep close, and don’t run!" said the savage who had addressed
me at first.</p>

<p>"No danger of my attempting it," I answered, following almost
cheerfully behind them.</p>

<p>And in truth it would have been the height of folly to make an
attempt to escape. Each of the savages was a fleet runner, each
possessed a loaded rifle (and one of them had another, together
with my revolver, which, by the way, was a source of great wonderment
and perplexity to him), and the utmost limit that I possibly could
have gained, as will be evident to the reader, was perhaps ten
feet. So I meditated no attempt, but followed close in the footsteps
of my captors.</p>

<p>No halt was made for breakfast, and during the whole forenoon
we tramped through the wilderness in a northerly direction. As
I knew I was in the extreme upper part of the great Nebraska Territory
when taken captive, I felt pretty certain that I was now in the
Hudson Bay Territory, within the British line. But here my companions
made a turn to the eastward, and then, strangely enough, proceeded
south again, so that I was uncertain whether I was now in the
United States or not. The reason of this detour on the part of
the savages I never knew and could only conjecture. I afterward
imagined it was for the purpose of misleading and bewildering
me in case I should ever attempt to leave them.</p>

<p>When the sun was overhead, the Indians halted upon the bank of
a small flashing stream, and prepared their meal. A half-hour
before halting, one of the Indians had dodged off into the forest.
Some time after I heard the report of a rifle, and in a few minutes
he returned with a large ptarmigan in his hand. The feathers were
plucked from this, and the body dressed much after the fashion
of civilized communities. It was then partially cooked over the
blaze, and despite the change of circumstances, I made as good
and substantial a meal upon it as did any of my companions.</p>

<p>The meal finished, the savages squatted before the fire, drew
forth their pipes and commenced silently smoking, their eyes glittering
through the vapor with suppressed fierceness, as ever and anon
a sidelong glance was bestowed upon me. One of the Indians&mdash;he
who spoke English&mdash;was examining my revolver. He closed one eye
and peered wonderingly into the six little barrels; then he fingered
about the hammer, took off the cap, tasted it, and replaced it.
(It may be remarked here that at the time of my experience, percussion
caps were almost unknown in this region. As they were of comparatively
recent invention, few of the trappers consented to use them until
a long time after.) I was expecting each moment to see the weapon
discharge itself, as it was fully charged, and was handled awkwardly.
The Indian looked at it in every direction, at last gave it up.
He took a smell of it, and snuffing the gunpowder, handed it to
me.</p>

<p>"What is he?"</p>

<p>"A young gun," I answered with a smile.</p>

<p>As I took the weapon I looked about me. There were five unsuspicious
savages, and there were six messengers of death at my command.
For an instant a wild resolve thrilled me; but it was for an instant
only. My soul revolted at the wholesale slaughter I should be
compelled to inflict, and I looked at my interlocutor with a pleasant
smile.</p>

<p>"Does he shoot?" he queried, his dark eyes lighting up with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Of course. Would you like to see me fire it?"</p>

<p>"Yaw! shoot at him," he answered, pointing at the trunk of a
large tree.</p>

<p>"What part of it?"</p>

<p>"Hit him where you mind to."</p>

<p>"Oh, let’s have a mark," I laughed, stepping forward and tearing
off a small piece of the bark, so as to offer a red spot several
inches in diameter. The other savages were now surveying my motions
with interest, and with some degree of suspicion the formidable
looking little weapon in my hand. I saw there was an opportunity
for making a good impression and I resolved to do it. I stepped
back a few paces, took a careful, though apparently a careless
aim, and fired the six barrels in succession with tolerable good
effect.</p>

<p>"Just look at the mark," I remarked, rather stiffly.</p>

<p>The Indian stepped forward and examined the holes, all within
an inch or two of the center. Then with his knife he pried out
each bullet, and showed them to his companions. They grunted their
satisfaction, or rather wonder, and turned the diminutive six-shooter
over and over in their hands, totally unable to comprehend how
such a number of fatal shots could come almost simultaneously
from it. I loaded and fired it a number of times, and my friend&mdash;he
who spoke English&mdash;asked me to make him a present of it. I assented
with the greatest pleasure, as I had no power to refuse, and volunteered
to instruct him in its use, and all things considered we were
getting on quite intimate terms.</p>

<p>This proceeding of mine was a stroke of policy, to which I believe
I owe my life. My apparent cheerfulness, my readiness to acquiesce
in all their wishes, convinced them that I cherished no sullen
vindictiveness toward them, and I am well satisfied that had I
asked my captors at this time to allow me to proceed unmolested
upon my way, they would have done so. Yet I was perfectly willing
to tarry with them a while, for reasons which, I trust, are obvious
to the reader, and I made no request of them.</p>

<p>We remained in this spot for over an hour practicing with the
revolver. At the end of that time its new owner had made such
progress as to be able to strike a good-sized tree a yard distant,
at nearly every shot.</p>

<p>"Him nice thing!" he remarked, shoving it carefully down in his
belt.</p>

<p>"Very good in a close hug with a bear or foe," I replied.</p>

<p>"He is, by dam," he added, pulling it forth and again examining
each part.</p>

<p>There was but one drawback to the savage’s prospect of pleasure.
I had but a small quantity of caps, and of course there was no
means of obtaining any among his own kindred. He however satisfied
himself with the thought that he could obtain more at some of
the trading posts in that section.</p>

<p>The line of march was again taken up, and continued until nightfall.
They traveled in Indian file, my dusky friend bringing up the
rear, and myself directly in front of him. This plan was adopted,
not through any fear of pursuit, as they were in their own country,
but because caution and watchfulness are habitual to the North
American Indian. Every now and then the click of the revolver
was audible behind, but I felt no apprehension as I knew the savage
was only examining it for his own pleasure.</p>

<p>Just before dusk we reached a large and rapidly flowing stream.
Here the rifles were slung about their persons, and we grasped
hands and plunged unhesitatingly in. Had not this expedient been
adopted, I should never have reached the opposite side. We sank
to our shoulders several times, and the boisterous current lifted
me clean from the bottom, but the strong arms of my captors were
all-efficient, and held me firmly in my place until the opposite
shore was reached, with no greater misfortune than the uncomfortableness
of our soaked and clinging garments.</p>

<p>The sun had sunk behind the western mountains, and the deep gloom
of night was settling over the wilderness, when as we reached
the top of a swell, I saw for the first time the Indian village.
It lay in a sort of valley, and numbered sixty or seventy lodges.
As seen in the dim twilight these looked singularly picturesque
and fanciful. I could see dark forms flitting like shadows about
the lodges, and the low hum of their conversation was audible.
We were descried, as our forms stood out in relief against the
sky, but no signals were given by either party.</p>

<p>As we descended into the valley my heart began to fail me, at
what I feared my reception would be. Stories of the tortures undergone
by captives came over me, and I ventured my fears to my friend.</p>

<p>"What your name?" he asked, halting and turning toward me.</p>

<p>"Will," I replied.</p>

<p>"Will stay here, and me come and fix things. My name Jim," said
he, taking the name probably given him by the whites with whom
he was acquainted.</p>

<p>The other savages seeing us halting stopped also, and looked
suspiciously. Jim (as I shall hereafter name him) said something
in an unintelligible tongue and they passed on.</p>

<p>"Stay here, Will, and me fix things."</p>

<p>With this he disappeared, and I seated myself upon the ground
to await his return. It struck me as rather curious for him to
give a captive such a good opportunity to escape, but it pleased
me withal, and it need not be told I made no attempt to make off.</p>

<p>In a few moments he returned, bearing in his arms several Indian
garments.</p>

<p>"Will put him on, and me fix things," said he, throwing them
down beside me. I hastily donned them, understanding fully their
use and intentions.</p>

<p>"Keep close, and don’t say nothing to nobody," he added, as they
enveloped my person.</p>

<p>He now turned his face towards the village, and we were soon
wending our way through it. We passed several savages who spoke
to me, Jim however taking the responsibility of replying. At last
we reached his lodge without my identity being discovered. This
was at the extreme eastern end of the village, and as we entered
I saw it was devoid of any persons except ourselves.</p>

<p>"You sleep there, Will," said he, pointing to one corner, where
a buffalo robe was visible by the dim light of a few smoldering
embers. I repaired to the spot, thanking him for his kindly offer,
and lay down, while he replenished the fire, seating himself by
it, and commenced the never-ceasing pleasure of examining his
revolver.</p>

<p>Lying half asleep on the buffalo robe, listlessly gazing at the
savage, his features all at once struck me. I had seen them before,
but where I could not recollect. Let me see&mdash;ah! it was plain
now. He was one of the occupants of the mysterious canoe!</p>

<p>It soon became known throughout the Indian village that a white
man was a captive among them, and the next morning the entrance
to Jim’s lodge was thronged with hundreds anxious to get a peep
at me. Knowing that this curiosity must be gratified sooner or
later, I stepped boldly forth, and mingled among them, in order
to have the matter finished at once. No violence was offered me,
although several pinched my arms rather severely, seemingly determined
to be satisfied upon all my points.</p>

<p>My Indian friend Jim was married, and, in the course of the day,
his squaw made her appearance. She was a middle-aged woman, and
tolerably good-looking for a savage. Jim informed her that I was
to be her slave, and thus it may be said I was established in
winter-quarters.</p>

<p>The heavy storm referred to in the previous chapter, was the
close of the warm season, and the fierce northern winter commenced
setting in. Winter in the northwest is far different from that
season in the Middle States. It is full six months in continuance,
and such is the intense coldness for the greater part of the season,
that the thermometer sinks to thirty and often forty degrees below
zero. Two weeks after my capture, it seemed impossible to prevent
freezing to death in the lodge with a roaring fire a few feet
off. Yet the savages minded it hardly at all. A few extra garments
were added to their costume, and they flitted as incessantly through
the village as ever.</p>

<p>In the tribe it was acknowledged that I was the property of Jim,
and thus my lot was much more endurable than otherwise. He was
really a good-hearted Indian, I believe; and the course that I
ever maintained toward him won some of his regard. However, he
was a lazy dog, like all of his male kindred, and, although I
had an exalted opinion of him, it was impossible to discover in
him any of those poetical attributes which are so generally conceded
to the North American Indian. In conversation with me, he discarded
entirely those extravagant, highly-wrought figures of speech common
to his kindred, and added in their place an awkward oath or two,
and a phrase learned from the Hudson-Bay traders. The greater
part of the day he sat before his fire, smoking and gazing moodily
into it, while his better-half busied herself about the apartment
as willingly and contentedly as though she never dreamed of a
different lot. Of course, I assisted her as much as lay within
my power, and came at last to do all of the out-door work.</p>

<p>I have always regarded my capture by this tribe of Indians as
a fortunate circumstance. I cannot imagine how else I could have
maintained life through the unusually severe winter which followed.
No mortal hand could have saved me from perishing from cold, while
it would have been utterly impossible to have procured food, when
the snow lay six feet upon the ground, and the rivers were sealed
by great depths of ice. Although frequent occasions presented
themselves, I determined to make no effort to leave my captors
until the spring had arrived.</p>

<p>As mentioned, I had pretty well-defined suspicions that Jim was
one of the savages who occupied the mysterious canoe, referred
to in the preceding chapters. I was not positive of this, although,
when I stood by his side and viewed his profile, the resemblance
seemed perfect.</p>

<p>One great disappointment had already come. I was sure that I
should learn something either of Nat, or of the fair, mysterious
captive. When I questioned Jim, he answered with such apparent
sincerity and truth, that I was pretty well convinced he knew
nothing of either. In regard to the latter he laughed; the former
he merely shook his head; he knew nothing of either. Sometimes
when I fell into a deep reverie, and suddenly awoke, I could see
Jim lift his eyes quickly from me, as though he had been endeavoring
to satisfy himself of my identity. He questioned me artfully,
and I told him all. At last, I resolved to put the question direct.</p>

<p>"Jim, didn’t you and another warrior, some weeks ago, pass down
the river, some distance south, with a white woman?"</p>

<p>There was a perceptible start at this question, but he answered
promptly:</p>

<p>"Don’t know nothing ’bout ’em."</p>

<p>"Why, I was pretty sure that I saw you."</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be gained by further questioning, and I
gave it up. But I was satisfied he knew more of Nat and the sweet
captive than he was willing to tell&mdash;and I was not mistaken.</p>

<p>Shortly after this conversation, Jim told me that he and several
of his tribe were in the employ of the Hudson Bay Fur Company,
and traded numerous furs with them every spring. I asked him whether
he was not in the territory of the Northwest Fur Company. He replied
that that made no difference; each trespassed upon the other’s
grounds, and he had been engaged for both.[2]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
[2] The Hudson Bay Company, established two hundred years ago,<br/>
by Prince Rupert, divided its territory into four<br/>
compartments&mdash;the Northern, including all the country of the Far<br/>
North; the Southern, extending south to Lake Superior; the<br/>
Montreal, including the country along the northern shore of the<br/>
Gulf of St. Lawrence; and the Columbia Department, comprehending<br/>
all the country west of the Rocky Mountains, including Oregon,<br/>
in which, I believe, they still trade.

</p>
</div>
<p>A few weeks subsequent to this, there came a storm which laid
the snow six feet deep, and Jim informed me that, in company with
several others, he should proceed to set his traps for the winter’s
work, and he willingly consented that I should accompany him.
Preparations were accordingly made. Extra garments were donned,
a couple of traps taken by each, and, placing our snow-shoes upon
our feet, we sallied forth. This was the first time I ever attempted
to travel with snow-shoes, and, as may be supposed, I made awkward
work of it. These were fully six feet in length, resembling a
canoe somewhat in shape, and of extreme lightness. The interior
is filled with a gauzy network, which allows the light, sand-like
snow to fall through without impeding one’s progress. They are
fastened loosely but securely to the feet, and when the snow is
not dampened by thaws, twenty miles can be easily made in a day.
Without these convenient things, it would be next to impossible
to travel during six months of the year in the fur-bearing regions.</p>

<p>We proceeded westward some eight or ten miles before all of the
traps were set, when, turning, we retraced our steps, intending
to visit them the following night. The trap used by the Indians
of this section is much the same as the common steel-trap of the
States, being, however, much larger, and without the saw-like
teeth of the latter. A long chain, with a heavy stone attached,
is fastened to the trap, and concealed beneath the snow, to prevent
the animal making off with the whole concern. The trap is placed
just beneath the surface of the snow, and bits of frozen fish
are scattered around, which attract the half-starved foxes, lynx,
beavers, and wolves in the region. Having completed all arrangements,
we retraced our steps, and reached the village just as night was
setting in.</p>

<p>Nothing of note took place the next day, and, as the night came
on, Jim informed me that they were going to visit their traps
to ascertain what luck they had. As he made no objection, I again
donned my snow-shoes and joined them. There was but one savage
beside himself. The snow was crisp and fine, and the traveling
comparatively easy. Jim dragged a small sled behind him for the
purpose of bringing back anything found in the traps.</p>

<p>It was a bright moonlight night, and as we journeyed through
the forest, there were patches of snow almost as light as day.
We shunned the trees, as the snow-crust was brittle around them,
and once or twice crossed broad belts of snow, devoid of timber,
which Jim informed me were the beds of rivers. As we traveled
on, nothing broke the silence, except the muffled sliding of our
shoes over the icy crust, or a single word from one of the savages;
and it occurred to me that if my friends at home could have seen
me at this particular moment, they would have imagined I was searching
for gold in a strange country.</p>

<p>The first trap we reached had the <em>fore-leg</em> of a fox
in it only. I looked at Jim inquiringly, unable to understand
what it meant.</p>

<p>"He gnawed him off, and run away; look out next time."</p>

<p>The fox had been caught by his fore-leg, and, finding himself
unable to get loose, had eaten off the imprisoned limb and escaped
on the others. In a month’s time he would probably suffer no inconvenience
from it. In the next trap was found a red fox, whose fur bears
but a trifling value. He was killed, placed upon the sled, the
trap reset, and we proceeded to the rest. None of them had been
visited, except the last. In this was imprisoned a beautiful black
fox, the capture of which nearly set the two savages into ecstasies.
The fur, of this animal is more valuable than that of any other
caught by the trappers, one alone sometimes bringing as high as
two hundred dollars. It is so rarely captured, and such a prize,
when taken, that a hunter would be satisfied with one single animal
during the whole season.</p>

<p>Our two animals being secured upon our sled, and the traps carefully
reset, we commenced our return journey. The night was far advanced
when we reached the Indian village. As we entered our lodge, Jim’s
squaw arose noiselessly and replenished the fire. While removing
my snow-shoes, I remarked to Jim that my feet had felt for the
last hour or two as though they were asleep.</p>

<p>"Let me see him," he asked quickly, jerking off the thick moccasins
which I had donned a few weeks back. He looked at my feet a moment,
and then exclaimed, "By dam, him froze up!"</p>

<p>I was considerably startled at this, and anxiously asked him
if they were badly frozen.</p>

<p>"Yaw, but me fix em," he answered, and commenced immediately
rubbing until I begged him to desist. He paid no heed to my entreaties,
but continued this treatment until he had restored completely
the congealed circulation, and saved the useful members.</p>

<p>The savages had but poor fortune in trapping this winter, and
there was considerable suffering. The Indians of the northwest
rely solely upon what they are able thus to take, for their food
during the cold season; and, as there is generally plenty of game,
they fare well. But now and then some unaccountable cause drives
all the animals away, and cases of actual starvation have occurred.
Jim told me that three winters before a case of cannibalism had
occurred in their tribe, and years before that, when a mere child,
there came an appalling time. Half the families were obliged to
devour some of their members to support life until spring, and,
for over a week, an old, miserable bison supported the whole tribe.
Jim said he had more than once cooked his moccasins and eaten
them.</p>

<p>The tribe was driven to no such extremity as this while I was
with them, and I saw no want myself. Jim was one of their best
hunters and he supplied his own lodge before that of others. Yet,
there were others who were not so fortunate, and who were often
compelled to endure the pangs of hunger for days at a time. When
food was secured, they gorged themselves nearly to bursting, and
were the happiest of mortals, until the wants of nature again
made themselves felt.</p>

<p>I could write far more of my experience with this tribe of Indians;
but I feel it would be hardly in place here, as there are other
characters in this narrative who must claim notice. My aim has
been only to dwell long enough upon particulars, for an understanding
of the events that follow. During my captivity, several things
occurred to make me suspect that the mysterious captive referred
to was in this village the whole time, and I was satisfied that
the Indian Jim knew more of Nat than he would impart to me. These
imaginings filled me with moody misgivings, and I made a resolve
that as soon as spring came I would make my escape; and if I could
learn nothing of the two beings whose fate was unknown to me,
depart for the States. The life I was leading was a wearisome,
monotonous one, and in time would become unbearable. Spring was
but a month or two distant, and in its approach I placed my fondest
hopes; but it was doomed to open an experience in my life of which
I little dreamed.</p>
