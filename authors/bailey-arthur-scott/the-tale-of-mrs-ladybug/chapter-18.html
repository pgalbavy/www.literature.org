<p>THERE was one thing that Mrs. Ladybug dreaded more than any other. That
was--fire. The slightest whiff of smoke sent her into a flutter of
alarm. The sight of a blaze made her almost frantic.
</p>
<p>Perhaps Mrs. Ladybug's neighbors--more than she--were to be blamed for
her fear. Some of them had an unkind way of frightening her. When they
found her a bit too prying with her countless questions about this,
that, and the other matter that did not concern her, they said to her:
</p><p>"Aren't you worried, Mrs. Ladybug? What if your house were on fire?
Wouldn't your children burn?"
</p><p>Such questions never failed to send Mrs. Ladybug hurrying away.
</p><p>After a while people began to wonder where Mrs. Ladybug went when she
dashed away like that. Nobody seemed to know where she lived. They
supposed that she must fly to her home, wherever it was.
</p><p>To everybody's surprise, Mrs. Ladybug appeared to want to keep the site
of her house a secret from all her friends. When they asked her,
point-blank, where her house was, she always pretended not to hear the
question and left them. Or she would begin to ask questions of her own
choosing, without answering theirs.
</p><p>"Humph!" said some people. "Mrs. Ladybug likes to pry into our affairs.
She wants to know all about our business. And when she learns anything
about anybody else she can't rest until she has told it to the whole
neighborhood."
</p><p>The more Mrs. Ladybug's friends thought about her house, the harder they
tried to discover its whereabouts. Sometimes they even mentioned <u>fire</u>
to her and then tried to follow her when she hurried off. But she always
managed to give them the slip before she had gone far.
</p><p>Now and then somebody or other thought he had found Mrs. Ladybug's
house. But in the end somebody else was sure to prove that he was
mistaken.
</p><p>Once Freddie Firefly announced with great pride that at last he knew
where Mrs. Ladybug was rearing her family.
</p><p>"Her house," he explained, "is in a hole in the ground, in the meadow."
</p><p>And that night he led Miss Mehitable Moth to the spot, lighting the way
with his flickering gleams.
</p><p>She soon pointed out his mistake. He had led her to the doorway of the
Bumblebee family, who were all sound asleep inside their crowded house.
</p><p>After that Freddie Firefly had to listen to a good many titters from his
friends.
</p><p>"The idea!" they would say. "Mrs. Ladybug must have a much bigger house
than the Bumblebee family's. She couldn't squeeze her children into such
small quarters as theirs. Why, she has more children than she can
count."
