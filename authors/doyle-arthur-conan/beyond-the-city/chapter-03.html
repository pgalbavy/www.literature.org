How deeply are our destinies influenced by the most
trifling causes!  Had the unknown builder who erected and
owned these new villas contented himself by simply
building each within its own grounds, it is probable that
these three small groups of people would have remained
hardly conscious of each other's existence, and that
there would have been no opportunity for that action and
reaction which is here set forth.  But there was a common
link to bind them together.  To single himself out from
all other Norwood builders the landlord had devised and
laid out a common lawn tennis ground, which stretched
behind the houses with taut-stretched net, green
close-cropped sward, and widespread whitewashed lines. 
Hither in search of that hard exercise which is as
necessary as air or food to the English temperament, came
young Hay Denver when released from the toil of the City;
hither, too, came Dr. Walker and his two fair daughters,
Clara and Ida, and hither also, champions of the lawn,
came the short-skirted, muscular widow and her athletic
nephew.  Ere the summer was gone they knew each other in
this quiet nook as they might not have done after years
of a stiffer and more formal acquaintance.
<P>
And especially to the Admiral and the Doctor were
this closer intimacy and companionship of value.  Each
had a void in his life, as every man must have who with
unexhausted strength steps out of the great race, but
each by his society might help to fill up that of his
neighbor.  It is true that they had not much in
common, but that is sometimes an aid rather than a bar to
friendship.  Each had been an enthusiast in his
profession, and had retained all his interest in it.  The
Doctor still read from cover to cover his Lancet and
his Medical Journal, attended all professional
gatherings, worked himself into an alternate state of
exaltation and depression over the results of the
election of officers, and reserved for himself a den of
his own, in which before rows of little round bottles
full of glycerine, Canadian balsam, and staining agents,
he still cut sections with a microtome, and peeped
through his long, brass, old-fashioned microscope at the
arcana of nature.  With his typical face, clean shaven on
lip and chin, with a firm mouth, a strong jaw, a steady
eye, and two little white fluffs of whiskers, he could
never be taken for anything but what he was, a high-class
British medical consultant of the age of fifty, or
perhaps just a year or two older.
<P>
The Doctor, in his hey-day, had been cool over great
things, but now, in his retirement, he was fussy over
trifles.  The man who had operated without the quiver of
a finger, when not only his patient's life but his own
reputation and future were at stake, was now shaken to
the soul by a mislaid book or a careless maid.  He
remarked it himself, and knew the reason.  "When Mary
was alive," he would say, "she stood between me and the
little troubles.  I could brace myself for the big ones. 
My girls are as good as girls can be, but who can know a
man as his wife knows him?"  Then his memory would
conjure up a tuft of brown hair and a single white, thin
hand over a coverlet, and he would feel, as we have all
felt, that if we do not live and know each other after
death, then indeed we are tricked and betrayed by all the
highest hopes and subtlest intuitions of our nature.
<P>
The Doctor had his compensations to make up for his
loss.  The great scales of Fate had been held on a level
for him; for where in all great London could one find two
sweeter girls, more loving, more intelligent, and more
sympathetic than Clara and Ida Walker?  So bright were
they, so quick, so interested in all which interested
him, that if it were possible for a man to be compensated
for the loss of a good wife then Balthazar Walker might
claim to be so.
<P>
Clara was tall and thin and supple, with a graceful,
womanly figure.  There was something stately and
distinguished in her carriage, "queenly" her friends
called her, while her critics described her as reserved
and distant.
<P>
Such as it was, however, it was part and parcel of
herself, for she was, and had always from her
childhood been, different from any one around her.  There
was nothing gregarious in her nature.  She thought with
her own mind, saw with her own eyes, acted from her own
impulse.  Her face was pale, striking rather than pretty,
but with two great dark eyes, so earnestly questioning,
so quick in their transitions from joy to pathos, so
swift in their comment upon every word and deed around
her, that those eyes alone were to many more attractive
than all the beauty of her younger sister.  Hers was a
strong, quiet soul, and it was her firm hand which had
taken over the duties of her mother, had ordered the
house, restrained the servants, comforted her father, and
upheld her weaker sister, from the day of that great
misfortune.
<P>
Ida Walker was a hand's breadth smaller than Clara,
but was a little fuller in the face and plumper in the
figure.  She had light yellow hair, mischievous blue eyes
with the light of humor ever twinkling in their depths,
and a large, perfectly formed mouth, with that slight
upward curve of the corners which goes with a keen
appreciation of fun, suggesting even in repose that a
latent smile is ever lurking at the edges of the lips. 
She was modern to the soles of her dainty little
high-heeled shoes, frankly fond of dress and of pleasure,
devoted to tennis and to comic opera, delighted with a
dance, which came her way only too seldom, longing
ever for some new excitement, and yet behind all this
lighter side of her character a thoroughly good,
healthy-minded English girl, the life and soul of the
house, and the idol of her sister and her father.  Such
was the family at number two.  A peep into the remaining
villa and our introductions are complete.
<P>
Admiral Hay Denver did not belong to the florid,
white-haired, hearty school of sea-dogs which is more
common in works of fiction than in the Navy List.  On the
contrary, he was the representative of a much more common
type which is the antithesis of the conventional sailor. 
He was a thin, hard-featured man, with an ascetic,
acquiline cast of face, grizzled and hollow-cheeked,
clean-shaven with the exception of the tiniest curved
promontory of ash-colored whisker.  An observer,
accustomed to classify men, might have put him down as a
canon of the church with a taste for lay costume and a
country life, or as the master of a large public school,
who joined his scholars in their outdoor sports.  His
lips were firm, his chin prominent, he had a hard, dry
eye, and his manner was precise and formal.  Forty years
of stern discipline had made him reserved and silent. 
Yet, when at his ease with an equal, he could readily
assume a less quarter-deck style, and he had a fund of
little, dry stories of the world and its ways which were
of interest from one who had seen so many phases of
life.  Dry and spare, as lean as a jockey and as tough as
whipcord, he might be seen any day swinging his
silver-headed Malacca cane, and pacing along the suburban
roads with the same measured gait with which he had been
wont to tread the poop of his flagship.  He wore a good
service stripe upon his cheek, for on one side it was
pitted and scarred where a spurt of gravel knocked up by
a round-shot had struck him thirty years before, when he
served in the Lancaster gun-battery.  Yet he was hale and
sound, and though he was fifteen years senior to his
friend the Doctor, he might have passed as the younger
man.
<P>
Mrs. Hay Denver's life had been a very broken one,
and her record upon land represented a greater amount of
endurance and self-sacrifice than his upon the sea.  They
had been together for four months after their marriage,
and then had come a hiatus of four years, during which he
was flitting about between St. Helena and the Oil Rivers
in a gunboat.  Then came a blessed year of peace and
domesticity, to be followed by nine years, with only a
three months' break, five upon the Pacific station, and
four on the East Indian.  After that was a respite in the
shape of five years in the Channel squadron, with
periodical runs home, and then again he was off to the
Mediterranean for three years and to Halifax for
four.  Now, at last, however, this old married couple,
who were still almost strangers to one another, had come
together in Norwood, where, if their short day had been
chequered and broken, the evening at least promised to be
sweet and mellow.  In person Mrs. Hay Denver was tall and
stout, with a bright, round, ruddy-cheeked face still
pretty, with a gracious, matronly comeliness.  Her whole
life was a round of devotion and of love, which was
divided between her husband and her only son, Harold.
<P>
This son it was who kept them in the neighborhood of
London, for the Admiral was as fond of ships and of salt
water as ever, and was as happy in the sheets of a
two-ton yacht as on the bridge of his sixteen-knot
monitor.  Had he been untied, the Devonshire or Hampshire
coast would certainly have been his choice.  There was
Harold, however, and Harold's interests were their chief
care.  Harold was four-and-twenty now.  Three years
before he had been taken in hand by an acquaintance of
his father's, the head of a considerable firm of
stock-brokers, and fairly launched upon 'Change.  His
three hundred guinea entrance fee paid, his three
sureties of five hundred pounds each found, his name
approved by the Committee, and all other formalities
complied with, he found himself whirling round, an
insignificant unit, in the vortex of the money market
of the world.  There, under the guidance of his father's
friend, he was instructed in the mysteries of bulling and
of bearing, in the strange usages of 'Change in the
intricacies of carrying over and of transferring.  He
learned to know where to place his clients' money, which
of the jobbers would make a price in New Zealands, and
which would touch nothing but American rails, which might
be trusted and which shunned.  All this, and much more,
he mastered, and to such purpose that he soon began to
prosper, to retain the clients who had been recommened to
him, and to attract fresh ones.  But the work was never
congenial.  He had inherited from his father his love of
the air of heaven, his affection for a manly and natural
existence.  To act as middleman between the pursuer of
wealth, and the wealth which he pursued, or to stand as
a human barometer, registering the rise and fall of the
great mammon pressure in the markets, was not the work
for which Providence had placed those broad shoulders and
strong limbs upon his well knit frame.  His dark open
face, too, with his straight Grecian nose, well opened
brown eyes, and round black-curled head, were all those
of a man who was fashioned for active physical work. 
Meanwhile he was popular with his fellow brokers,
respected by his clients, and beloved at home, but his
spirit was restless within him and his mind chafed
unceasingly against his surroundings.
<P>
"Do you know, Willy," said Mrs. Hay Denver one
evening as she stood behind her husband's chair, with her
hand upon his shoulder, "I think sometimes that Harold is
not quite happy."
<P>
"He looks happy, the young rascal," answered the
Admiral, pointing with his cigar.  It was after dinner,
and through the open French window of the dining-room a
clear view was to be had of the tennis court and the
players.  A set had just been finished, and young Charles
Westmacott was hitting up the balls as high as he could
send them in the middle of the ground.  Doctor Walker and
Mrs. Westmacott were pacing up and down the lawn, the
lady waving her racket as she emphasized her remarks, and
the Doctor listening with slanting head and little nods
of agreement.  Against the rails at the near end Harold
was leaning in his flannels talking to the two sisters,
who stood listening to him with their long dark shadows
streaming down the lawn behind them.  The girls were
dressed alike in dark skirts, with light pink tennis
blouses and pink bands on their straw hats, so that as
they stood with the soft red of the setting sun tinging
their faces, Clara, demure and quiet, Ida, mischievous
and daring, it was a group which might have pleased
the eye of a more exacting critic than the old sailor.
<P>
"Yes, he looks happy, mother," he repeated, with a
chuckle.  "It is not so long ago since it was you and I
who were standing like that, and I don't remember that we
were very unhappy either.  It was croquet in our time,
and the ladies had not reefed in their skirts quite so
taut.  What year would it be?  Just before the commission
of the Penelope."
<P>
Mrs. Hay Denver ran her fingers through his grizzled
hair.  "It was when you came back in the Antelope, just
before you got your step."
<P>
"Ah, the old Antelope!  What a clipper she was! 
She could sail two points nearer the wind than anything
of her tonnage in the service.  You remember her, mother. 
You saw her come into Plymouth Bay.  Wasn't she a
beauty?"
<P>
"She was indeed, dear.  But when I say that I think
that Harold is not happy I mean in his daily life.  Has
it never struck you how thoughtful, he is at times, and
how absent-minded?"
<P>
"In love perhaps, the young dog.  He seems to have
found snug moorings now at any rate."
<P>
"I think that it is very likely that you are right,
Willy," answered the mother seriously.  "But with which
of them?"
<P>
"I cannot tell."
<P>
"Well, they are very charming girls, both of
them.  But as long as he hangs in the wind between
the two it cannot be serious.  After all, the boy is
four-and-twenty, and he made five hundred pounds last
year.  He is better able to marry than I was when I was
lieutenant."
<P>
"I think that we can see which it is now," remarked
the observant mother.  Charles Westmacott had ceased to
knock the tennis balls about, and was chatting with Clara
Walker, while Ida and Harold Denver were still talking by
the railing with little outbursts of laughter.  Presently
a fresh set was formed, and Doctor Walker, the odd man
out, came through the wicket gate and strolled up the
garden walk.
<P>
"Good evening, Mrs. Hay Denver," said he, raising his
broad straw hat.  "May I come in?"
<P>
"Good evening, Doctor!  Pray do!"
<P>
"Try one of these," said the Admiral, holding out his
cigar-case.  "They are not bad.  I got them on the
Mosquito Coast.  I was thinking of signaling to you, but
you seemed so very happy out there."
<P>
"Mrs. Westmacott is a very clever woman," said the
Doctor, lighting the cigar.  "By the way, you spoke about
the Mosquito Coast just now.  Did you see much of the
Hyla when you were out there?"
<P>
"No such name on the list," answered the seaman,
with decision.  "There's the Hydra, a harbor defense
turret-ship, but she never leaves the home waters."
<P>
The Doctor laughed.  "We live in two separate
worlds," said he.  "The Hyla is the little green tree
frog, and Beale has founded some of his views on
protoplasm upon the appearancer, of its nerve cells.  It
is a subject in which I take an interest."
<P>
"There were vermin of all sorts in the woods.  When
I have been on river service I have heard it at night
like the engine-room when you are on the measured mile. 
You can't sleep for the piping, and croaking, and
chirping.  Great Scott! what a woman that is!  She was
across the lawn in three jumps.  She would have made a
captain of the foretop in the old days."
<P>
"She is a very remarkable woman.
<P>
"A very cranky one."
<P>
"A very sensible one in some things," remarked Mrs.
Hay Denver.
<P>
"Look at that now!" cried the Admiral, with a lunge
of his forefinger at the Doctor.  "You mark my words,
Walker, if we don't look out that woman will raise a
mutiny with her preaching.  Here's my wife disaffected
already, and your girls will be no better.  We must
combine, man, or there's an end of all discipline."
<P>
"No doubt she is a little excessive in her views."
said the Doctor, "but in the main I think as she does." 
<P>
"Bravo, Doctor!" cried the lady.
<P>
"What, turned traitor to your sex!  We'll
court-martial you as a deserter."
<P>
"She is quite right.  The professions are not
sufficiently open to women.  They are still far too much
circumscribed in their employments.  They are a feeble
folk, the women who have to work for their bread--poor,
unorganized, timid, taking as a favor what they might
demand as a right.  That is why their case is not more
constantly before the public, for if their cry for
redress was as great as their grievance it would fill the
world to the exclusion of all others.  It is all very
well for us to be courteous to the rich, the refined,
those to whom life is already made easy.  It is a mere
form, a trick of manner.  If we are truly courteous, we
shall stoop to lift up struggling womanhood when she
really needs our help--when it is life and death to her
whether she has it or not.  And then to cant about it
being unwomanly to work in the higher professions.  It is
womanly enough to starve, but unwomanly to use the brains
which God has given them.  Is it not a monstrous
contention?"
<P>
The Admiral chuckled.  "You are like one of these
phonographs, Walker," said he; "you have had all this
talked into you, and now you are reeling it off again. 
It's rank mutiny, every word of it, for man has his
duties and woman has hers, but they are as separate
as their natures are.  I suppose that we shall have a
woman hoisting her pennant on the flagship presently, and
taking command of the Channel Squadron."
<P>
"Well, you have a woman on the throne taking command
of the whole nation," remarked his wife; "and everybody
is agreed that she does it better than any of the men." 
<P>
The Admiral was somewhat staggered by this
home-thrust.  "That's quite another thing," said he.
<P>
"You should come to their next meeting.  I am to take
the chair.  I have just promised Mrs. Westmacott that I
will do so.  But it has turned chilly, and it is time
that the girls were indoors.  Good night!  I shall look
out for you after breakfast for our constitutional,
Admiral."
<P>
The old sailor looked after his friend with a twinkle
in his eyes.
<P>
"How old is he, mother?"
<P>
"About fifty, I think."
<P>
"And Mrs. Westmacott?"
<P>
"I heard that she was forty-three."
<P>
The Admiral rubbed his hands, and shook with
amusement.  "We'll find one of these days that three and
two make one," said he.  I'll bet you a new bonnet on it,
mother.
