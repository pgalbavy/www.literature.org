<p>It was on a Saturday that the children made their first glorious
journey on the wishing carpet.  Unless you are too young to read at
all, you will know that the next day must have been Sunday.</p>

<p>Sunday at 18, Camden Terrace, Camden Town, was always a very pretty
day.  Father always brought home flowers on Saturday, so that the
breakfast-table was extra beautiful.  In November, of course, the
flowers were chrysanthemums, yellow and coppery coloured.  Then
there were always sausages on toast for breakfast, and these are
rapture, after six days of Kentish Town Road eggs at fourteen a
shilling.</p>

<p>On this particular Sunday there were fowls for dinner, a kind of
food that is generally kept for birthdays and grand occasions, and
there was an angel pudding, when rice and milk and oranges and
white icing do their best to make you happy.</p>

<p>After dinner father was very sleepy indeed, because he had been
working hard all the week; but he did not yield to the voice that
said, 'Go and have an hour's rest.'  He nursed the Lamb, who had a
horrid cough that cook said was whooping-cough as sure as eggs, and
he said - </p>

<p>'Come along, kiddies; I've got a ripping book from the library,
called The Golden Age, and I'll read it to you.'</p>

<p>Mother settled herself on the drawing-room sofa, and said she could
listen quite nicely with her eyes shut.  The Lamb snugged into the
'armchair corner' of daddy's arm, and the others got into a happy
heap on the hearth-rug.  At first, of course, there were too many
feet and knees and shoulders and elbows, but real comfort was
actually settling down on them, and the Phoenix and the carpet were
put away on the back top shelf of their minds (beautiful things
that could be taken out and played with later), when a surly solid
knock came at the drawing-room door.  It opened an angry inch, and
the cook's voice said, 'Please, m', may I speak to you a moment?'</p>

<p>Mother looked at father with a desperate expression.  Then she put
her pretty sparkly Sunday shoes down from the sofa, and stood up in
them and sighed.</p>

<p>'As good fish in the sea,' said father, cheerfully, and it was not
till much later that the children understood what he meant.</p>

<p>Mother went out into the passage, which is called 'the hall', where
the umbrella-stand is, and the picture of the 'Monarch of the Glen'
in a yellow shining frame, with brown spots on the Monarch from the
damp in the house before last, and there was cook, very red and
damp in the face, and with a clean apron tied on all crooked over
the dirty one that she had dished up those dear delightful chickens
in.  She stood there and she seemed to get redder and damper, and
she twisted the corner of her apron round her fingers, and she said
very shortly and fiercely - </p>

<p>'If you please ma'am, I should wish to leave at my day month.'
Mother leaned against the hatstand.  The children could see her
looking pale through the crack of the door, because she had been
very kind to the cook, and had given her a holiday only the day
before, and it seemed so very unkind of the cook to want to go like
this, and on a Sunday too.</p>

<p>'Why, what's the matter?' mother said.</p>

<p>'It's them children,' the cook replied, and somehow the children
all felt that they had known it from the first.  They did not
remember having done anything extra wrong, but it is so frightfully
easy to displease a cook.  'It's them children: there's that there
new carpet in their room, covered thick with mud, both sides,
beastly yellow mud, and sakes alive knows where they got it.  And
all that muck to clean up on a Sunday!  It's not my place, and it's
not my intentions, so I don't deceive you, ma'am, and but for them
limbs, which they is if ever there was, it's not a bad place,
though I says it, and I wouldn't wish to leave, but - '</p>

<p>'I'm very sorry,' said mother, gently.  'I will speak to the
children.  And you had better think it over, and if you REALLY wish
to go, tell me to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Next day mother had a quiet talk with cook, and cook said she
didn't mind if she stayed on a bit, just to see.</p>

<p>But meantime the question of the muddy carpet had been gone into
thoroughly by father and mother.  Jane's candid explanation that
the mud had come from the bottom of a foreign tower where there was
buried treasure was received with such chilling disbelief that the
others limited their defence to an expression of sorrow, and of a
determination 'not to do it again'.  But father said (and mother
agreed with him, because mothers have to agree with fathers, and
not because it was her own idea) that children who coated a carpet
on both sides with thick mud, and when they were asked for an
explanation could only talk silly nonsense - that meant Jane's
truthful statement - were not fit to have a carpet at all, and,
indeed, SHOULDN'T have one for a week!</p>

<p>So the carpet was brushed (with tea-leaves, too) which was the only
comfort Anthea could think of) and folded up and put away in the
cupboard at the top of the stairs, and daddy put the key in his
trousers pocket.  'Till Saturday,' said he.</p>

<p>'Never mind,' said Anthea, 'we've got the Phoenix.'</p>

<p>But, as it happened, they hadn't.  The Phoenix was nowhere to be
found, and everything had suddenly settled down from the rosy wild
beauty of magic happenings to the common damp brownness of ordinary
November life in Camden Town - and there was the nursery floor all
bare boards in the middle and brown oilcloth round the outside, and
the bareness and yellowness of the middle floor showed up the
blackbeetles with terrible distinctness, when the poor things came
out in the evening, as usual, to try to make friends with the
children.  But the children never would.</p>

<p>The Sunday ended in gloom, which even junket for supper in the blue
Dresden bowl could hardly lighten at all.  Next day the Lamb's
cough was worse.  It certainly seemed very whoopy, and the doctor
came in his brougham carriage.</p>

<p>Every one tried to bear up under the weight of the sorrow which it
was to know that the wishing carpet was locked up and the Phoenix
mislaid.  A good deal of time was spent in looking for the Phoenix.</p>

<p>'It's a bird of its word,' said Anthea.  'I'm sure it's not
deserted us.  But you know it had a most awfully long fly from
wherever it was to near Rochester and back, and I expect the poor
thing's feeling tired out and wants rest.  I am sure we may trust
it.'</p>

<p>The others tried to feel sure of this, too, but it was hard.</p>

<p>No one could be expected to feel very kindly towards the cook,
since it was entirely through her making such a fuss about a little
foreign mud that the carpet had been taken away.</p>

<p>'She might have told us,' said Jane, 'and Panther and I would have
cleaned it with tea-leaves.'</p>

<p>'She's a cantankerous cat,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'I shan't say what I think about her,' said Anthea, primly,
'because it would be evil speaking, lying, and slandering.'</p>

<p>'It's not lying to say she's a disagreeable pig, and a beastly
blue-nosed Bozwoz,' said Cyril, who had read The Eyes of Light, and
intended to talk like Tony as soon as he could teach Robert to talk
like Paul.</p>

<p>And all the children, even Anthea, agreed that even if she wasn't
a blue-nosed Bozwoz, they wished cook had never been born.</p>

<p>But I ask you to believe that they didn't do all the things on
purpose which so annoyed the cook during the following week, though
I daresay the things would not have happened if the cook had been
a favourite.  This is a mystery.  Explain it if you can.  The
things that had happened were as follows:</p>

<p>Sunday. - Discovery of foreign mud on both sides of the carpet.</p>

<p>Monday. - Liquorice put on to boil with aniseed balls in a saucepan.
Anthea did this, because she thought it would be good for the
Lamb's cough.  The whole thing forgotten, and bottom of saucepan
burned out.  It was the little saucepan lined with white that was
kept for the baby's milk.</p>

<p>Tuesday. - A dead mouse found in pantry.  Fish-slice taken to dig
grave with.  By regrettable accident fish-slice broken.  Defence:
'The cook oughtn't to keep dead mice in pantries.'</p>

<p>Wednesday. - Chopped suet left on kitchen table.  Robert added
chopped soap, but he says he thought the suet was soap too.</p>

<p>Thursday. - Broke the kitchen window by falling against it during a
perfectly fair game of bandits in the area.</p>

<p>Friday. - Stopped up grating of kitchen sink with putty and filled
sink with water to make a lake to sail paper boats in.  Went away
and left the tap running.  Kitchen hearthrug and cook's shoes
ruined.</p>

<p>On Saturday the carpet was restored.  There had been plenty of time
during the week to decide where it should be asked to go when they
did get it back.</p>

<p>Mother had gone over to granny's, and had not taken the Lamb
because he had a bad cough, which, cook repeatedly said, was
whooping-cough as sure as eggs is eggs.</p>

<p>'But we'll take him out, a ducky darling,' said Anthea.  'We'll
take him somewhere where you can't have whooping-cough.  Don't be
so silly, Robert.  If he DOES talk about it no one'll take any
notice.  He's always talking about things he's never seen.'</p>

<p>So they dressed the Lamb and themselves in out-of-doors clothes,
and the Lamb chuckled and coughed, and laughed and coughed again,
poor dear, and all the chairs and tables were moved off the carpet
by the boys, while Jane nursed the Lamb, and Anthea rushed through
the house in one last wild hunt for the missing Phoenix.</p>

<p>'It's no use waiting for it,' she said, reappearing breathless in
the breakfast-room.  'But I know it hasn't deserted us.  It's a
bird of its word.'</p>

<p>'Quite so,' said the gentle voice of the Phoenix from beneath the
table.</p>

<p>Every one fell on its knees and looked up, and there was the
Phoenix perched on a crossbar of wood that ran across under the
table, and had once supported a drawer, in the happy days before
the drawer had been used as a boat, and its bottom unfortunately
trodden out by Raggett's Really Reliable School Boots on the feet
of Robert.</p>

<p>'I've been here all the time,' said the Phoenix, yawning politely
behind its claw.  'If you wanted me you should have recited the ode
of invocation; it's seven thousand lines long, and written in very
pure and beautiful Greek.'</p>

<p>'Couldn't you tell it us in English?' asked Anthea.</p>

<p>'It's rather long, isn't it?' said Jane, jumping the Lamb on her
knee.</p>

<p>'Couldn't you make a short English version, like Tate and Brady?'</p>

<p>'Oh, come along, do,' said Robert, holding out his hand.  'Come
along, good old Phoenix.'</p>

<p>'Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix,' it corrected shyly.</p>

<p>'Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix, then.  Come along, come along,' said
Robert, impatiently, with his hand still held out.</p>

<p>The Phoenix fluttered at once on to his wrist.</p>

<p>'This amiable youth,' it said to the others, 'has miraculously been
able to put the whole meaning of the seven thousand lines of Greek
invocation into one English hexameter - a little misplaced some of
the words - but</p>

<p>'Oh, come along, come along, good old beautiful Phoenix!'</p>

<p>'Not perfect, I admit - but not bad for a boy of his age.'</p>

<p>'Well, now then,' said Robert, stepping back on to the carpet with
the golden Phoenix on his wrist.</p>

<p>'You look like the king's falconer,' said Jane, sitting down on the
carpet with the baby on her lap.</p>

<p>Robert tried to go on looking like it.  Cyril and Anthea stood on
the carpet.</p>

<p>'We shall have to get back before dinner,' said Cyril, 'or cook
will blow the gaff.'</p>

<p>'She hasn't sneaked since Sunday,' said Anthea.</p>

<p>'She - ' Robert was beginning, when the door burst open and the
cook, fierce and furious, came in like a whirlwind and stood on the
corner of the carpet, with a broken basin in one hand and a threat
in the other, which was clenched.</p>

<p>'Look 'ere!' she cried, 'my only basin; and what the powers am I to
make the beefsteak and kidney pudding in that your ma ordered for
your dinners?  You don't deserve no dinners, so yer don't.'</p>

<p>'I'm awfully sorry, cook,' said Anthea gently; 'it was my fault,
and I forgot to tell you about it.  It got broken when we were
telling our fortunes with melted lead, you know, and I meant to
tell you.'</p>

<p>'Meant to tell me,' replied the cook; she was red with anger, and
really I don't wonder - 'meant to tell!  Well, <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> mean to tell, too. 
I've held my tongue this week through, because the missus she said
to me quiet like, &quot;We mustn't expect old heads on young shoulders,&quot;
but now I shan't hold it no longer.  There was the soap you put in
our pudding, and me and Eliza never so much as breathed it to your
ma - though well we might - and the saucepan, and the fish-slice,
and - My gracious cats alive! what 'ave you got that blessed child
dressed up in his outdoors for?'</p>

<p>'We aren't going to take him out,' said Anthea; 'at least - ' She
stopped short, for though they weren't going to take him out in the
Kentish Town Road, they certainly intended to take him elsewhere. 
But not at all where cook meant when she said 'out'.  This confused
the truthful Anthea.</p>

<p>'Out!' said the cook, 'that I'll take care you don't;' and she
snatched the Lamb from the lap of Jane, while Anthea and Robert
caught her by the skirts and apron.  'Look here,' said Cyril, in
stern desperation, 'will you go away, and make your pudding in a
pie-dish, or a flower-pot, or a hot-water can, or something?'</p>

<p>'Not me,' said the cook, briefly; 'and leave this precious poppet
for you to give his deathercold to.'</p>

<p>'I warn you,' said Cyril, solemnly.  'Beware, ere yet it be too
late.'</p>

<p>' Late yourself the little popsey-wopsey,' said the cook, with
angry tenderness.  'They shan't take it out, no more they shan't. 
And - Where did you get that there yellow fowl?'  She pointed to the
Phoenix.</p>

<p>Even Anthea saw that unless the cook lost her situation the loss
would be theirs.</p>

<p>'I wish,' she said suddenly, 'we were on a sunny southern shore,
where there can't be any whooping-cough.'</p>

<p>She said it through the frightened howls of the Lamb, and the
sturdy scoldings of the cook, and instantly the
giddy-go-round-and-falling-lift feeling swept over the whole party,
and the cook sat down flat on the carpet, holding the screaming
Lamb tight to her stout print-covered self, and calling on St
Bridget to help her.  She was an Irishwoman.</p>

<p>The moment the tipsy-topsy-turvy feeling stopped, the cook opened
her eyes, gave one sounding screech and shut them again, and Anthea
took the opportunity to get the desperately howling Lamb into her
own arms.</p>

<p>'It's all right,' she said; 'own Panther's got you.  Look at the
trees, and the sand, and the shells, and the great big tortoises. 
Oh DEAR, how hot it is!'</p>

<p>It certainly was; for the trusty carpet had laid itself out on a
southern shore that was sunny and no mistake, as Robert remarked. 
The greenest of green slopes led up to glorious groves where
palm-trees and all the tropical flowers and fruits that you read of
in Westward Ho! and Fair Play were growing in rich profusion. 
Between the green, green slope and the blue, blue sea lay a stretch
of sand that looked like a carpet of jewelled cloth of gold, for it
was not greyish as our northern sand is, but yellow and
changing - opal-coloured like sunshine and rainbows.  And at the
very moment when the wild, whirling, blinding, deafening, tumbling
upside-downness of the carpet-moving stopped, the children had the
happiness of seeing three large live turtles waddle down to the
edge of the sea and disappear in the water.  And it was hotter than
you can possibly imagine, unless you think of ovens on a
baking-day.</p>

<p>Every one without an instant's hesitation tore off its
London-in-November outdoor clothes, and Anthea took off the Lamb's
highwayman blue coat and his three-cornered hat, and then his
jersey, and then the Lamb himself suddenly slipped out of his
little blue tight breeches and stood up happy and hot in his little
white shirt.</p>

<p>'I'm sure it's much warmer than the seaside in the summer,' said
Anthea.  'Mother always lets us go barefoot then.'</p>

<p>So the Lamb's shoes and socks and gaiters came off, and he stood
digging his happy naked pink toes into the golden smooth sand.</p>

<p>'I'm a little white duck-dickie,' said he - 'a little white
duck-dickie what swims,' and splashed quacking into a sandy pool.</p>

<p>'Let him,' said Anthea; 'it can't hurt him.  Oh, how hot it is!'</p>

<p>The cook suddenly opened her eyes and screamed, shut them, screamed
again, opened her eyes once more and said - </p>

<p>'Why, drat my cats alive, what's all this?  It's a dream, I expect.</p>

<p>Well, it's the best I ever dreamed.  I'll look it up in the
dream-book to-morrow.  Seaside and trees and a carpet to sit on. 
I never did!'</p>

<p>'Look here,' said Cyril, 'it isn't a dream; it's real.'</p>

<p>'Ho yes!' said the cook; 'they always says that in dreams.'</p>

<p>'It's REAL, I tell you,' Robert said, stamping his foot.  'I'm not
going to tell you how it's done, because that's our secret.'  He
winked heavily at each of the others in turn.  'But you wouldn't go
away and make that pudding, so we HAD to bring you, and I hope you
like it.'</p>

<p>'I do that, and no mistake,' said the cook unexpectedly; 'and it
being a dream it don't matter what I say; and I WILL say, if it's
my last word, that of all the aggravating little varmints - '
'Calm yourself, my good woman,' said the Phoenix.</p>

<p>'Good woman, indeed,' said the cook; 'good woman yourself' Then she
saw who it was that had spoken.  'Well, if I ever,' said she; 'this
is something like a dream!  Yellow fowls a-talking and all!  I've
heard of such, but never did I think to see the day.'</p>

<p>'Well, then,' said Cyril, impatiently, 'sit here and see the day
now.  It's a jolly fine day.  Here, you others - a council!'
They walked along the shore till they were out of earshot of the
cook, who still sat gazing about her with a happy, dreamy, vacant
smile.</p>

<p>'Look here,' said Cyril, 'we must roll the carpet up and hide it,
so that we can get at it at any moment.  The Lamb can be getting
rid of his whooping-cough all the morning, and we can look about;
and if the savages on this island are cannibals, we'll hook it, and
take her back.  And if not, we'll LEAVE HER HERE.'</p>

<p>'Is that being kind to servants and animals, like the clergyman
said?' asked Jane.</p>

<p>'Nor she isn't kind,' retorted Cyril.</p>

<p>'Well - anyway,' said Anthea, 'the safest thing is to leave the
carpet there with her sitting on it.  Perhaps it'll be a lesson to
her, and anyway, if she thinks it's a dream it won't matter what
she says when she gets home.'</p>

<p>So the extra coats and hats and mufflers were piled on the carpet. 
Cyril shouldered the well and happy Lamb, the Phoenix perched on
Robert's wrist, and 'the party of explorers prepared to enter the
interior'.</p>

<p>The grassy slope was smooth, but under the trees there were tangled
creepers with bright, strange-shaped flowers, and it was not easy
to walk.</p>

<p>'We ought to have an explorer's axe,' said Robert.  'I shall ask
father to give me one for Christmas.'</p>

<p>There were curtains of creepers with scented blossoms hanging from
the trees, and brilliant birds darted about quite close to their
faces.</p>

<p>'Now, tell me honestly,' said the Phoenix, 'are there any birds
here handsomer than I am?  Don't be afraid of hurting my
feelings - I'm a modest bird, I hope.'</p>

<p>'Not one of them,' said Robert, with conviction, 'is a patch upon
you!'</p>

<p>'I was never a vain bird,' said the Phoenix, 'but I own that you
confirm my own impression.  I will take a flight.'  It circled in
the air for a moment, and, returning to Robert's wrist, went on,
'There is a path to the left.'</p>

<p>And there was.  So now the children went on through the wood more
quickly and comfortably, the girls picking flowers and the Lamb
inviting the 'pretty dickies' to observe that he himself was a
'little white real-water-wet duck!'</p>

<p>And all this time he hadn't whooping-coughed once.</p>

<p>The path turned and twisted, and, always threading their way amid
a tangle of flowers, the children suddenly passed a corner and
found themselves in a forest clearing, where there were a lot of
pointed huts - the huts, as they knew at once, of SAVAGES.</p>

<p>The boldest heart beat more quickly.  Suppose they WERE cannibals. 
It was a long way back to the carpet.</p>

<p>'Hadn't we better go back?' said Jane.  'Go NOW,' she said, and her
voice trembled a little.  'Suppose they eat us.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense, Pussy,' said Cyril, firmly.  'Look, there's a goat tied
up.  That shows they don't eat PEOPLE.'</p>

<p>'Let's go on and say we're missionaries,' Robert suggested.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't advise THAT,' said the Phoenix, very earnestly.</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'Well, for one thing, it isn't true,' replied the golden bird.</p>

<p>It was while they stood hesitating on the edge of the clearing that
a tall man suddenly came out of one of the huts.  He had hardly any
clothes, and his body all over was a dark and beautiful coppery
colour - just like the chrysanthemums father had brought home on
Saturday.  In his hand he held a spear.  The whites of his eyes and
the white of his teeth were the only light things about him, except
that where the sun shone on his shiny brown body it looked white,
too.  If you will look carefully at the next shiny savage you meet
with next to nothing on, you will see at once - if the sun happens
to be shining at the time - that I am right about this.</p>

<p>The savage looked at the children.  Concealment was impossible.  He
uttered a shout that was more like 'Oo goggery bag-wag' than
anything else the children had ever heard, and at once brown
coppery people leapt out of every hut, and swarmed like ants about
the clearing.  There was no time for discussion, and no one wanted
to discuss anything, anyhow.  Whether these coppery people were
cannibals or not now seemed to matter very little.</p>

<p>Without an instant's hesitation the four children turned and ran
back along the forest path; the only pause was Anthea's.  She stood
back to let Cyril pass, because he was carrying the Lamb, who
screamed with delight.  (He had not whooping-coughed a single once
since the carpet landed him on the island.)</p>

<p>'Gee-up, Squirrel; gee-gee,' he shouted, and Cyril did gee-up.  The
path was a shorter cut to the beach than the creeper-covered way by
which they had come, and almost directly they saw through the trees
the shining blue-and-gold-and-opal of sand and sea.</p>

<p>'Stick to it,' cried Cyril, breathlessly.</p>

<p>They did stick to it; they tore down the sands - they could hear
behind them as they ran the patter of feet which they knew, too
well, were copper-coloured.</p>

<p>The sands were golden and opal-coloured - and BARE.  There were
wreaths of tropic seaweed, there were rich tropic shells of the
kind you would not buy in the Kentish Town Road under at least
fifteen pence a pair.  There were turtles basking lumpily on the
water's edge - but no cook, no clothes, and no carpet.</p>

<p>'On, on!  Into the sea!' gasped Cyril.  'They MUST hate water. 
I've - heard - savages always - dirty.'</p>

<p>Their feet were splashing in the warm shallows before his
breathless words were ended.  The calm baby-waves were easy to go
through.  It is warm work running for your life in the tropics, and
the coolness of the water was delicious.  They were up to their
arm-pits now, and Jane was up to her chin.</p>

<p>'Look!' said the Phoenix.  'What are they pointing at?'</p>

<p>The children turned; and there, a little to the west was a head - a
head they knew, with a crooked cap upon it.  It was the head of the
cook.</p>

<p>For some reason or other the savages had stopped at the water's
edge and were all talking at the top of their voices, and all were
pointing copper-coloured fingers, stiff with interest and
excitement, at the head of the cook.</p>

<p>The children hurried towards her as quickly as the water would let
them.</p>

<p>'What on earth did you come out here for?' Robert shouted; 'and
where on earth's the carpet?'</p>

<p>'It's not on earth, bless you,' replied the cook, happily; 'it's
UNDER ME - in the water.  I got a bit warm setting there in the sun,
and I just says, &quot;I wish I was in a cold bath&quot; - just like that - and
next minute here I was!  It's all part of the dream.'</p>

<p>Every one at once saw how extremely fortunate it was that the
carpet had had the sense to take the cook to the nearest and
largest bath - the sea, and how terrible it would have been if the
carpet had taken itself and her to the stuffy little bath-room of
the house in Camden Town!</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' said the Phoenix's soft voice, breaking in on the
general sigh of relief, 'but I think these brown people want your
cook.'</p>

<p>'To - to eat?' whispered Jane, as well as she could through the
water which the plunging Lamb was dashing in her face with happy
fat hands and feet.</p>

<p>'Hardly,' rejoined the bird.  'Who wants cooks to EAT?  Cooks are
ENGAGED, not eaten.  They wish to engage her.'</p>

<p>'How can you understand what they say?' asked Cyril, doubtfully.</p>

<p>'It's as easy as kissing your claw,' replied the bird.  'I speak
and understand ALL languages, even that of your cook, which is
difficult and unpleasing.  It's quite easy, when you know how it's
done.  It just comes to you.  I should advise you to beach the
carpet and land the cargo - the cook, I mean.  You can take my word
for it, the copper-coloured ones will not harm you now.'</p>

<p>It is impossible not to take the word of a Phoenix when it tells
you to.  So the children at once got hold of the corners of the
carpet, and, pulling it from under the cook, towed it slowly in
through the shallowing water, and at last spread it on the sand. 
The cook, who had followed, instantly sat down on it, and at once
the copper-coloured natives, now strangely humble, formed a ring
round the carpet, and fell on their faces on the rainbow-and-gold
sand.  The tallest savage spoke in this position, which must have
been very awkward for him; and Jane noticed that it took him quite
a long time to get the sand out of his mouth afterwards.</p>

<p>'He says,' the Phoenix remarked after some time, 'that they wish to
engage your cook permanently.'</p>

<p>'Without a character?' asked Anthea, who had heard her mother speak
of such things.</p>

<p>'They do not wish to engage her as cook, but as queen; and queens
need not have characters.'</p>

<p>There was a breathless pause.</p>

<p>'WELL,' said Cyril, 'of all the choices!  But there's no accounting
for tastes.'</p>

<p>Every one laughed at the idea of the cook's being engaged as queen;
they could not help it.</p>

<p>'I do not advise laughter,' warned the Phoenix, ruffling out his
golden feathers, which were extremely wet.  'And it's not their own
choice.  It seems that there is an ancient prophecy of this
copper-coloured tribe that a great queen should some day arise out
of the sea with a white crown on her head, and - and - well, you see!
There's the crown!'</p>

<p>It pointed its claw at cook's cap; and a very dirty cap it was,
because it was the end of the week.</p>

<p>'That's the white crown,' it said; 'at least, it's nearly
white - very white indeed compared to the colour THEY are - and
anyway, it's quite white enough.'</p>

<p>Cyril addressed the cook.  'Look here!' said he, 'these brown
people want you to be their queen.  They're only savages, and they
don't know any better.  Now would you really like to stay? or, if
you'll promise not to be so jolly aggravating at home, and not to
tell any one a word about to-day, we'll take you back to Camden
Town.'</p>

<p>'No, you don't,' said the cook, in firm, undoubting tones.  'I've
always wanted to be the Queen, God bless her! and I always thought
what a good one I should make; and now I'm going to.  IF it's only
in a dream, it's well worth while.  And I don't go back to that
nasty underground kitchen, and me blamed for everything; that I
don't, not till the dream's finished and I wake up with that nasty
bell a rang-tanging in my ears - so I tell you.'</p>

<p>'Are you SURE,' Anthea anxiously asked the Phoenix, 'that she will
be quite safe here?'</p>

<p>'She will find the nest of a queen a very precious and soft thing,'
said the bird, solemnly.</p>

<p>'There - you hear,' said Cyril.  'You're in for a precious soft
thing, so mind you're a good queen, cook.  It's more than you'd any
right to expect, but long may you reign.'</p>

<p>Some of the cook's copper-coloured subjects now advanced from the
forest with long garlands of beautiful flowers, white and
sweet-scented, and hung them respectfully round the neck of their
new sovereign.</p>

<p>'What! all them lovely bokays for me!' exclaimed the enraptured
cook.  'Well, this here is something LIKE a dream, I must say.'</p>

<p>She sat up very straight on the carpet, and the copper-coloured
ones, themselves wreathed in garlands of the gayest flowers, madly
stuck parrot feathers in their hair and began to dance.  It was a
dance such as you have never seen; it made the children feel almost
sure that the cook was right, and that they were all in a dream. 
Small, strange-shaped drums were beaten, odd-sounding songs were
sung, and the dance got faster and faster and odder and odder, till
at last all the dancers fell on the sand tired out.</p>

<p>The new queen, with her white crown-cap all on one side, clapped
wildly.</p>

<p>'Brayvo!' she cried, 'brayvo!  It's better than the Albert Edward
Music-hall in the Kentish Town Road.  Go it again!'</p>

<p>But the Phoenix would not translate this request into the
copper-coloured language; and when the savages had recovered their
breath, they implored their queen to leave her white escort and
come with them to their huts.</p>

<p>'The finest shall be yours, O queen,' said they.</p>

<p>'Well - so long!' said the cook, getting heavily on to her feet,
when the Phoenix had translated this request.  'No more kitchens
and attics for me, thank you.  I'm off to my royal palace, I am;
and I only wish this here dream would keep on for ever and ever.'</p>

<p>She picked up the ends of the garlands that trailed round her feet,
and the children had one last glimpse of her striped stockings and
worn elastic-side boots before she disappeared into the shadow of
the forest, surrounded by her dusky retainers, singing songs of
rejoicing as they went.</p>

<p>'WELL!' said Cyril, 'I suppose she's all right, but they don't seem
to count us for much, one way or the other.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said the Phoenix, 'they think you're merely dreams.  The
prophecy said that the queen would arise from the waves with a
white crown and surrounded by white dream-children.  That's about
what they think YOU are!'</p>

<p>'And what about dinner?' said Robert, abruptly.</p>

<p>'There won't be any dinner, with no cook and no pudding-basin,'
Anthea reminded him; 'but there's always bread-and-butter.'</p>

<p>'Let's get home,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>The Lamb was furiously unwishful to be dressed in his warm clothes
again, but Anthea and Jane managed it, by force disguised as
coaxing, and he never once whooping-coughed.</p>

<p>Then every one put on its own warm things and took its place on the
carpet.</p>

<p>A sound of uncouth singing still came from beyond the trees where
the copper-coloured natives were crooning songs of admiration and
respect to their white-crowned queen.  Then Anthea said 'Home,'
just as duchesses and other people do to their coachmen, and the
intelligent carpet in one whirling moment laid itself down in its
proper place on the nursery floor.  And at that very moment Eliza
opened the door and said - </p>

<p>'Cook's gone!  I can't find her anywhere, and there's no dinner
ready.  She hasn't taken her box nor yet her outdoor things.  She
just ran out to see the time, I shouldn't wonder - the kitchen clock
never did give her satisfaction - and she's got run over or fell
down in a fit as likely as not.  You'll have to put up with the
cold bacon for your dinners; and what on earth you've got your
outdoor things on for I don't know.  And then I'll slip out and see
if they know anything about her at the police-station.'</p>

<p>But nobody ever knew anything about the cook any more, except the
children, and, later, one other person.</p>

<p>Mother was so upset at losing the cook, and so anxious about her,
that Anthea felt most miserable, as though she had done something
very wrong indeed.  She woke several times in the night, and at
last decided that she would ask the Phoenix to let her tell her
mother all about it.  But there was no opportunity to do this next
day, because the Phoenix, as usual, had gone to sleep in some
out-of-the-way spot, after asking, as a special favour, not to be
disturbed for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The Lamb never whooping-coughed once all that Sunday, and mother
and father said what good medicine it was that the doctor had given
him.  But the children knew that it was the southern shore where
you can't have whooping-cough that had cured him.  The Lamb babbled
of coloured sand and water, but no one took any notice of that.  He
often talked of things that hadn't happened.</p>

<p>It was on Monday morning, very early indeed, that Anthea woke and
suddenly made up her mind.  She crept downstairs in her night-gown
(it was very chilly), sat down on the carpet, and with a beating
heart wished herself on the sunny shore where you can't have
whooping-cough, and next moment there she was.</p>

<p>The sand was splendidly warm.  She could feel it at once, even
through the carpet.  She folded the carpet, and put it over her
shoulders like a shawl, for she was determined not to be parted
from it for a single instant, no matter how hot it might be to
wear.</p>

<p>Then trembling a little, and trying to keep up her courage by
saying over and over, 'It is my DUTY, it IS my duty,' she went up
the forest path.</p>

<p>'Well, here you are again,' said the cook, directly she saw Anthea.</p>

<p>'This dream does keep on!'</p>

<p>The cook was dressed in a white robe; she had no shoes and
stockings and no cap and she was sitting under a screen of
palm-leaves, for it was afternoon in the island, and blazing hot. 
She wore a flower wreath on her hair, and copper-coloured boys were
fanning her with peacock's feathers.</p>

<p>'They've got the cap put away,' she said.  'They seem to think a
lot of it.  Never saw one before, I expect.'</p>

<p>'Are you happy?' asked Anthea, panting; the sight of the cook as
queen quite took her breath away.</p>

<p>'I believe you, my dear,' said the cook, heartily.  'Nothing to do
unless you want to.  But I'm getting rested now.  Tomorrow I'm
going to start cleaning out my hut, if the dream keeps on, and I
shall teach them cooking; they burns everything to a cinder now
unless they eats it raw.'</p>

<p>'But can you talk to them?'</p>

<p>'Lor' love a duck, yes!' the happy cook-queen replied; 'it's quite
easy to pick up.  I always thought I should be quick at foreign
languages.  I've taught them to understand &quot;dinner,&quot; and &quot;I want a
drink,&quot; and &quot;You leave me be,&quot; already.'</p>

<p>'Then you don't want anything?' Anthea asked earnestly and
anxiously.</p>

<p>'Not me, miss; except if you'd only go away.  I'm afraid of me
waking up with that bell a-going if you keep on stopping here
a-talking to me.  Long as this here dream keeps up I'm as happy as
a queen.'</p>

<p>'Goodbye, then,' said Anthea, gaily, for her conscience was clear
now.</p>

<p>She hurried into the wood, threw herself on the ground, and said
'Home' - and there she was, rolled in the carpet on the nursery
floor.</p>

<p>'SHE'S all right, anyhow,' said Anthea, and went back to bed.  'I'm
glad somebody's pleased.  But mother will never believe me when I
tell her.'</p>

<p>The story is indeed a little difficult to believe.  Still, you
might try.</p>
