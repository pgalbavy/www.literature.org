<p>Tom had preceded her to the house and evidently had told Aunt
Maria, for when the child burst into the kitchen trailing the
green gingham which she had picked up on her way, the worthy woman
said never a word of reproach, but with trembling fingers helped
her out of the queer little rig and laid it away herself among
its crumpled wrappings, while down her withered cheek stole two
tears of pity for the unhappy Tabitha.</p>

<p>"Supper is all ready. Come and have something to eat. I opened
a jar of jam just for you."</p>

<p>Tabitha shook her head, but gave her aunt a grateful look as
she rushed away to her room, slammed the door and crawled into
bed, where she lay trembling with anger and humiliation too great
for tears. The beauty of the day was gone, her pride in her school
achievements was ruthlessly swept away, happiness in these new
surroundings was dead.</p>

<p>Her father had said she lied, he had made her tell everyone so,
they would hate her now and have nothing to do with her, or else
they would make the days miserable by rude taunts and hateful
jeers as the children in other towns had done. Miss Brooks would
be disappointed in her and give her only cold looks and maybe
cross words. Probably even Carrie would no longer care to be her
friend. At this thought the tears came, hot, passionate and bitter,
and she sobbed convulsively under the pillow where she hid her
head that no one might hear. It seemed as if her heart would break.
Poor little Tabitha!</p>

<p>Outside the sunset colors faded, the twilight deepened and night
came on. The birds twittered sleepily in their nests, a night-hawk
screeched across the sky, in the distance the coyotes howled dismally,
and the ceaseless throbbing of the mines filled the desert quiet.</p>

<p>In the kitchen Aunt Maria clattered nervously around, upset dishes,
spilled the tea, burned the toast and forgot the potatoes entirely,
for her perplexed thoughts were with the sobbing child in bed;
and the minute the remnants of the evening meal were cleared away,
the woman vanished into her room for the night.</p>

<p>Tom tried to eat his supper, but the food choked him, and finding
rest impossible at the house, he went out of doors and up the
slope to the office, hopeful of finding work there to take his
attention; but the door was locked. He turned toward town with
its dim, scattered lights, but they mocked him, and everywhere
he looked he saw only the strained face of terrified Tabitha,
seeming to reproach him for his relaxed vigilance, and he blamed
himself bitterly for the calamity the day had brought upon her.
At last he crept home again and went to bed, where in the anguish
of his spirit, boy though he was, he dampened the pillow with
a few salty tears.</p>

<p>But strange as it may seem, Mr. Catt had the worst time of all.
For the first time in all his selfish life he seemed to see things
as they really were and to realize, in a measure, what a failure
he had made of his fatherhood. His slumbering conscience was roused
and for a few hours he had an uncomfortable struggle with himself;
but though he regretted his harshness, the habits of a lifetime
are not laid aside in a moment, and in the end he regarded himself
as more sinned against than sinning.</p>

<p>If only Fortune had favored him as it had some other people&mdash;if
only his wife had been spared him&mdash;if only friends had been true
to him, it might have been different. Maybe he had been too severe
with the girl, but she must be taught obedience. She was too much
of a spitfire already, and there was no telling what she might
do if some restraint was not put upon her. Still, perhaps a lighter
punishment would have served the purpose just as well. She was
a bright child; yes, he would admit that. Maybe if she had looked
a little more like the angel mother&mdash;and yet sometimes he could
scarcely bear to look at the boy because in Tom's face he saw
so often the warm tenderness that had endeared the mother to all
who knew her, and the deep, soft brown eyes that always looked
straight in one's face seemed to reproach him for his sternness
and neglect. He had mourned because the boy had not inherited
the black hair and eyes and the disposition of the Catts, and
now he was sorry because the girl had. He sighed; if only&mdash;</p>

<p>From the next room came a deep, heavy, sobbing sigh, as if an
echo of his. Tabitha had at last fallen asleep and in her slumber
had tossed aside the suffocating pillow from her hot, throbbing
head. He sat looking at the closed door for some minutes; then,
hardly knowing why he did so, he rose and entered her room.</p>

<p>She was still lying in a huddled heap, face down upon the mattress,
but her head was turned to one side, exposing the flushed, tear-stained
cheek and swollen lids where the tears were scarcely dry. One
thin arm was still curved beneath her head, but the other had
slipped away from her face and lay stretched across the covers,
the hand still loosely clutching a damp ball of handkerchief.
The pathetic little figure, still quivering convulsively with
every breath, touched the heart of the selfish man, and drawing
a five-dollar gold piece from his pocket he slipped it inside
the moist, brown fist. Then, as if realizing what a paltry thing
gold is in comparison with love, he stooped over the flushed face
and kissed it gently,&mdash;the first kiss he had ever given his little
daughter. She stirred, and the coin slipped from her hand, but
in his hasty retreat from the room he did not hear it fall to
the floor, roll across the light matting and lodge in a crack
out of sight. So he stilled the small, inner voice, and going
to his room sought his couch almost satisfied with himself.</p>

<p>The next morning when Tabitha awoke he was gone again, back to
the mines and their alluring gold, little realizing what a sore
heart he had left behind him in the cottage on the desert. At
first she could not think what had happened to leave such a heavy
weight on her heart that the very atmosphere seemed charged with
grief, but as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes, still hot and
stinging from her cry, she remembered the whole dreadful story,
and in the sympathetic pillow she again buried her face, too humiliated
to meet the world, too discouraged to care.</p>

<p>She heard the clock on the mantel strike seven and lay dreading
the call to get up. In the kitchen Aunt Maria was busy bustling
about the morning work, getting breakfast, washing the dishes
and sweeping. Once she heard Tom's voice, but though she strained
her ears, she could catch the sound of no answering tones.</p>

<p>The clock struck eight. Aunt Maria never let her stay in bed
that late, even on Sundays, when they all slept a little longer
than usual. There was a knock at the kitchen door. Could it be
Carrie on her way to school? Not very likely, as the Carson house
was nearer town than their cottage, and it was always her place
to call for Carrie. Besides, Carrie was never ready on time, and
they always had to hurry to reach school before the last bell
rang. Still, she held her breath expectantly when steps approached
her door, and her heart sank when they stopped and no one entered.</p>

<p>Carrie? What could she be thinking of&mdash;she, who had told a lie,
deceived people? Could she expect Carrie to call for her? Could
she expect Carrie to be her friend after all that had happened?
Down went her head into the pillow again and the hot tears flowed
in a bitter flood.</p>

<p>The screen door banged, Tom had gone to work. The clock struck
nine. There came another knock at the door, louder than the previous
one, and for a long time she could hear Aunt Maria's voice speaking
in low tones to someone who evidently stood on the steps outside.</p>

<p>Somewhere a sharp whistle sounded, and she flew up in bed startled
to hear the clock on the mantel counting off the hour of twelve.
She must have been asleep. Yes, she surely had been, for on the
chair beside her bed stood a tray heaped high with bread and butter,
cake and jam. A glass of milk was there also, and she drank it
eagerly, for she was thirsty; but she could not touch the food.</p>

<p>So the long day passed. Once Tom slipped in and bent over her,
but her eyes were closed, and thinking her asleep, he left a golden
orange beside her and went away. Once Aunt Maria asked her if
she didn't feel able to dress and go out of doors for the fresh
air, but she turned wearily away and hid her face in the pillow,
her only refuge.</p>

<p>The second morning someone had left her door ajar, and she heard
Aunt Maria say to Tom, "I don't know what in the world to do with
her. She will be sick if she stays that way much longer."</p>

<p>And in Tabitha's heart sprang the fierce longing to be sick,
very sick, so sick that they would have to take her away from
this horrible desert town. She had heard of such things happening;
perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>Tom's voice interrupted her thoughts.</p>

<p>"It is all my fault, Aunt Maria. She told me about the name,
but I didn't pay enough attention to know that she had really
taken it in place of her own. <em>I</em> ought to be thrashed
instead of her being punished. Now she won't look at me or listen
to me any more."</p>

<p>Tom took all the blame! Why, she had never for a moment thought
of such a thing! It <em>wasn't</em> his fault, she would tell
him so.</p>

<p>"Tom!"</p>

<p>The scraping of his chair as he pushed it back from the table
drowned the sound of her voice, and before she could call again
he was gone. She jumped out of bed, threw on her clothes, and
stopping only long enough to brush back her tangled hair, she
rushed out of the house and up the hill toward the office of the
surveyor.</p>

<p>Tom was standing by the big draughting table lettering a map,
the surveyor was busy with some blueprints in the window, and
Mr. Carson sat near by with a notebook in hand which he was searching
industriously. All this Tabitha saw as she stumbled over the threshold,
but without heeding either of the two men, she cast herself into
Tom's arms with the wail, "O, Tom, you ain't to blame, and you
don't deserve to be thrashed! I told a lie and I stole the white
silk dress with those lovely scallops. But those were such grand
names&mdash;yours 'specially, though mine was longer&mdash;and oh, I hate
being a cat all my life! I said more'n Dad gave me to say and
I told folks that his name was 'lean Manx Catt,' and I told 'em
Aunt Maria's name. Miss Brooks won't like me any more, and I expect
Carrie will hate me, too."</p>

<p>There was a stifled exclamation&mdash;she thought from Tom&mdash;then two
strong arms closed around her, and she found herself crying into
someone's vest pocket, but it wasn't Tom's. He had not yet attained
the dignity of vests. Surprised, she hushed her sobs, though she
still clung to the protecting arms, and in a moment she heard
Tom say, "She will be all right now, sir. I will take her home."</p>

<p>But the big arms only held her closer and Mr. Carson's voice,
trembling a little and husky with emotion, replied, "I want her
for a little while, Tom. Leave her with me."</p>

<p>Laying aside the notebook with its fascinating rows of figures,
the man led the amazed child out of the building and down the
steep rocky path toward the Carson home, holding her hand fast
in his own, and speaking gently, cheerily as they walked.</p>

<p>"It was all a mistake, little girl, and everyone makes mistakes.
It wasn't a lie and it wasn't stealing. You ought to have asked
someone about it and everything would have been all right, but
you mustn't cry about it any more. Carrie loves you just the same
and so does Mother Carson and so do I. I don't think Tabitha is
a horrid name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But Tabitha <em>Catt</em>!" quavered the tearful little voice.
"Folks make fun of me and say hateful things and call me Tabby
Catt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tabby cats are such nice pets," the man interrupted, "so gentle
and nice and pretty."</p>

<p>"But I'm homely. If I was pretty maybe they wouldn't call me
names."</p>

<p>"No, dear, it isn't that. When they plague you, you scratch;
and so they like to tease. If you paid no attention to the thoughtless
things they said, they would soon stop teasing."</p>

<p>"Do you really think they would? I thought it was because of
the name. No one teased me much when my name was Theodora Marcella
Gabrielle Julianna Victoria Emeline."</p>

<p>He smiled. The name sounded so perfectly incongruous for that
slender slip of girl, more so than the despised Tabitha; but he
understood what a charm the long, rhythmic words held for the
child who had missed so much happiness in her short life, so he
gravely answered,</p>

<p>"I am sure if you try to laugh with those who make fun of you,
and won't get mad no matter what they say, they will soon forget
all about the odd little name and will love you for what you are."</p>

<p>"That will be awfully hard to do," sighed Tabitha, thinking of
the many times she had been tormented because of that name, "but
if&mdash;you think it will work, &mdash;I'll try."</p>

<p>Before he had a chance to say anything further, the door of the
Carson house flew open and happy-faced Carrie flew up the path
to meet them, crying joyously, "Miss Brooks is here, and she wants
to see you, 'cause we've missed you dreadfully at school."</p>
