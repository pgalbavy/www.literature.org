<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was a sleepless night for every one in the house of Eben Tollman.
Conscience still felt that her long fight had ended in a total defeat
and that she had been saved from worse than defeat only because her
victor had risen to her plea for magnanimity. Now she lay staring at the
ceiling with eyes that burned in their sockets. Self-pity warred with
self-accusation.
</p>
<p>She could not forget that moment of ecstasy in her lover's arms nor
banish her wish for its repetition. With him the home of her dreams
might have been a reality where men and women who made splendid
successes and splendid failures came and talked of their deeds and their
frustrations, and where children who were the children of love raised
rose-bud lips to be kissed.
</p><p>Ahead lay an indefinite future, of Stygian murk, peopled with melancholy
shades.
</p><p>Stuart himself did not attempt to sleep. He sat in a chair at his window
and stared out. Once or twice he lighted a pipe, only to let it die to
ashes between his teeth. He must not tarry here, beyond to-morrow. He
had taken either a high and chivalrous ground or a sentimentally weak
one. In either case it was an attitude to which he stood pledged, and
one to which Conscience attached the importance of salvation. How long
could he hold it?
</p><p>But of the three minds prickled with insomniac activity, the operations
of the elderly husband's were the strangest and most weirdly
interesting. They had thrown off the halter of sanity and ranged into
the imaginative unrestraint of fantastic deviltry.
</p><p>Sitting alone in the study, Eben sipped brandy and indulged his
abnormality. For him, weaving certainties out of the tenuous threads of
hallucination, there developed the spaciousness and might of epic
tragedies.
</p><p>The brandy itself was a symptom of his quiet madness. Until recently he
would as readily have fondled a viper as toyed with a bottle.
</p><p>Now he had formed the habit of lifting a secret glass, as a rite and a
toast to the portrait of the ancestor, with whose spirit he seemed to
commune.
</p><p>The things that had festered in the unclean soreness of his brain had
tinctured every thought with their poison of monomania, leaving him
without a suspicion of his own miserable deceit. He believed that he
held the imperative commission of the Deity to act as a vicegerent and
an avenger. God had designated him as a prosecutor, and to-night he was
summing up the case against the transgressors.
</p><p>"A sinful and an adulterous generation!" he breathed with curling lips.
</p><p>Item by item he went over the evidence, and it fitted and jibed in every
detail. From the first interrupted assignation at Providence to this
evening when he had seen, silhouetted against a starry sky, the man
carrying close to his breast the wife of another, no link failed to join
into a perfect chain of guilt.
</p><p>But above all he must remain just--as just as the Divinity whose
commission he served. This essence of absolute and impersonal
righteousness demanded an overt act of unquestionable guilt. "So saith
the Lord."
</p><p>When that deciding proof was established there should fall upon the
sinning pair the wrath of an outraged heaven, and he, Eben Tollman, in
whom every feeling of the heart had turned to the gall of hatred, would
hurl the bolt.
</p><p>But when he appeared at the breakfast table the next morning he brought
the only untroubled face to be seen there.
</p><p>"I am going to New York this afternoon," announced Stuart somewhat
bluntly, and Eben looked quickly up, frankly surprised.
</p><p>"Running down for a day or two? You'll be back, of course?" he inquired,
and the guest shook his head.
</p><p>"No. I sha'n't be back at all."
</p><p>"But your Broadway opening doesn't take place until October? Didn't you
tell us that?"
</p><p>"Perhaps. I'm not going on that account."
</p><p>"Then why not finish out your vacation?"
</p><p>"I have finished it."
</p><p>The host looked at his guest and read in his eyes a defiant dislike and
a repressed ferocity, but he chose to ignore it. The long-fostered
urbanity of his make-believe must last a little longer. But at that
moment Stuart's eyes met those of Conscience and he acknowledged a sense
of chagrin.
</p><p>After all, he was leaving to-day and whatever his feelings, he had so
far been outwardly the beneficiary of Tollman's hospitality. Nothing was
to be gained, except a sort of churlish satisfaction, by assuming at the
eleventh hour a blunt and open hostility of manner.
</p><p>"I'm sorry," suggested Tollman evenly. "I had hoped that we might have
you with us longer. You have brought a certain animation to the
uneventfulness of our life here."
</p><p>Stuart changed his manner with an effort.
</p><p>"Thank you," he replied. "But I've already over-stayed the time I had
allowed myself for a vacation. There are many neglected things to be
taken up and finished."
</p><p>"You hadn't spoken of leaving us before." The regret in Tollman's voice
was sincere, because it was the regret of a trapper who sees game
slipping away from the snare, and it made him perhaps a shade over
insistent. "Do you really regard it as so important?"
</p><p>For just an instant a gleam of anger showed in the visitor's eyes under
this questioning, and his glance, leveled straight at his host, was that
of a man who would prefer open combat to veiled hostility.
</p><p>"Not only important," he corrected, "but vital."
</p><p>"Of course, in that event," murmured Mr. Tollman, "there is nothing more
to say."
</p><p>But an hour later as Conscience and Farquaharson sat on the terrace,
somewhat silent and constrained, Eben joined them with a deeply troubled
face.
</p><p>"I've just come from the telephone," he announced with the air of a man
in quandary. "It was an imperative call from Boston--and it puts me in a
most awkward position."
</p><p>Farquaharson, sitting with the drawn brow of preoccupation, simulated
for his host's assertion no interest and offered no response, but
Conscience asked, "What is it, Eben?"
</p><p>"It's a business matter but one that involves a duty to my associates. I
don't see how I can ignore it or decline to go."
</p><p>"But why shouldn't you go?" inquired his wife, and immediately Eben
replied.
</p><p>"Ordinarily I should, but Stuart says he must leave for New York to-day
and there are no servants on the place. You can't stay here absolutely
alone."
</p><p>"I shall be all right," she declared, but her husband raised his hands
in a gesture of reasonable protest.
</p><p>"I couldn't think of it," he insisted. "Why, it's a half-mile to the
nearest house. It wouldn't do."
</p><p>Then with an urgency of manner he turned to Farquaharson.
</p><p>"Stuart, I dislike greatly to ask you to change your plans--but you
realize the situation. Can't you put off leaving until to-morrow?"
</p><p>The younger man turned slowly and his gaze was disconcertingly
piercing, as he asked, "Don't you regard that as a somewhat
unconventional suggestion--leaving Conscience here with no one but me?
What of Dame Grundy?"
</p><p>Eben only laughed and arched his brows in amusement.
</p><p>"Why, my dear boy, you're a member of the family, aren't you? Such a
question is the height of absurdity."
</p><p>"Your faith is touching," retorted the visitor dryly, then he added:
"I'm sorry, but I must go this afternoon."
</p><p>Before him rose the true proportions of the ordeal to which his host so
casually invited him, and from facing them he flinched with the honesty
of genuine apprehension.
</p><p>After last night each hour spent here meant trusting under fire a
resolution attained only in a moment of something like exaltation. Such
an experiment seemed the rashness of sheer irresponsibility, and to
underestimate its danger was only recklessness.
</p><p>Then he saw Conscience's eyes fixed musingly upon him and in them
brooded a confidence which he could not analyze or comprehend.
</p><p>"I wouldn't urge it," went on Eben persistently, "if there were any
other solution--but there doesn't seem to be. So in spite of your
objections I believe you'll do as I ask, Stuart, even at the cost of
some inconvenience to yourself. In a way you can't refuse, my boy,
because until this morning you gave us no warning of this sudden
flight."
</p><p>And with a complacency which the younger man found as galling as an
insult, the host turned and went into the house with an air of one who
takes for granted compliance with his expressed wish.
</p><p>Indeed, his line of reasoning admitted no doubt or shadow of doubt. He
had construed Stuart's first refusal as a mere trick of intrigue,
cloaking under the appearance of protest a situation eagerly welcomed.
Refuse an uninterrupted opportunity to take to his embraces the woman he
adored with a guilty passion! Eben laughed to himself at the thought.
Does a hungry lion scorn striking down its prey? Does a thief repudiate
an unwatched treasury?
</p><p>But when he had gone, Stuart turned indignantly to Conscience.
</p><p>"You see, don't you, that it's impossible?"
</p><p>"Why?" she asked, and in his bewilderment he found himself answering
excitedly:
</p><p>"Why? Do you mean that, after last night, you would trust yourself here
... with me ... and no one else? Didn't we both admit that it was too
much for us--unless we separated?"
</p><p>"After last night," she responded, and the fearlessness of her voice
utterly confounded him, "I would trust myself with you anywhere."
</p><p>"God in Heaven!" he burst out. "Don't you realize that all strength is
relative? Don't you know that any boiler ever made will explode if you
give it enough pressure?"
</p><p>"It's not a test I welcome either," she declared seriously. "But I do
believe in you now--and there's another side to it." After a moment's
hesitation she went on slowly: "After going through last night--and
after trying to face the future ... there's comfort in feeling that he
trusts me like that. I don't deserve it, but I'd like to ... and when he
comes back to-morrow, if there's one day more of fight left in you,
Stuart dear--I can."
</p><p>His expression changed and he said dubiously: "It's going to be hard."
</p><p>"Yes, but how can we tell him that?"
</p><p>He nodded acknowledgment of the point. "There <u>is</u> something in being
trusted," he told her resolutely. "If you can feel secure with me one
day more--I'll go through with it."
</p><p>So Eben had his way and put his own damaging construction on the result.
</p><p>"Good!" he announced when the visitor finally acceded; "I felt sure you
wouldn't leave me in the lurch. I'll drive the buggy to the train and
leave it at the livery stable until I get back--since we have no
chauffeur."
</p><p>When Tollman had gone Stuart came to Conscience on the terrace. "You'll
be all right here for a while, won't you?" he asked. "I think I'll go
for a tramp."
</p><p>She said nothing, but her eyes were questioning, and the man answered
their interrogation almost gruffly.
</p><p>"We've got to walk close to the edge," he said with the quiet of
restrained passion. "You trust me, you say, and even before you said it
I read it in your eyes. I want that same trust to be in them
to-morrow.... I don't know how you feel, but I'm like the reforming
drunkard--tortured by his thirst." He paused, then added, "I think it's
just as well to walk off my restiveness if I can."
</p>
<p>It was five o'clock when he returned, hot and weary from fast tramping
in the blistering heat, but when he presented himself, as dusty as a
miller to Conscience, who received him among the flowers of her garden,
the woman recognized, from his face and the smile of self-victory in his
eyes, that he had come back a dependable ally and not a dangerous enemy.
In his voice as he hailed her was the old ring of comradeship--and it
was almost cheerful. "Hurry into your bathing suit," he invited tersely.
"The water is bluer than water ever was before."
</p><p>Her eyes met his dubiously. She had not, like himself, burned out her
wretchedness of spirit in muscular fatigue.
</p><p>"I feel rather tired, Stuart," she demurred. But he answered
decisively, "That's exactly why you need a plunge. You'll go in the
tired housekeeper and come out Aphrodite rising from the foam."
</p><p>"To-morrow perhaps--" she began, but he shook his head.
</p><p>"If I'm any judge of weather the furies are brewing something in the
line of a tempest. To-morrow will probably be a day of storm."
</p><p>Under his forced lightness of speech, she realized the tenderness of
solicitude--and acquiesced, because he wished it.
</p><p>From her window as she changed into bathing things she saw the cove,
blue as the Bay of Naples. After to-morrow, she thought, she would hate
that cove. After to-morrow she must begin making her life over, and it
would be like poverty's task of turning thread-bare seams.
</p><p>In a little while Stuart, waiting for her in the hall below, heard, as
he had heard on the day of his arrival, a laugh at the stairhead and
looked up to see her there, standing once more in the attitude of one
about to dive.
</p><p>Her bare arms were raised and her dark hair fell heavily about her face,
for she had not yet gathered and bound it under her bathing cap.
</p><p>Through the emptiness of after years, he knew that picture would haunt
him with the ache of inexpressible allurement, but now he forced a laugh
and, stretching up his own arms, said challengingly, "Jump; I'll catch
you."
</p><p>Each detail of that swimming excursion was a reminder; an emphasis of
thought upon these little things which association had made
unaccountably dear, and which must be relinquished, yet the physical
stimulus of the cooling water and the rhythmic companionship of the long
swim across the cove and back had their effect, too, and were healing.
</p><p>As he followed her up the twisting path ... between pine and bayberry
... for the last time ... the sun shone on her until she sparkled as if
the clinging silk of her dripping bathing dress were sea weed, and in
his heart he cursed Eben Tollman.
</p><p>When they sat alone at table, where shams refuse to survive, a silence
of constraint fell upon them and each fresh effort at talk broke down in
pitiful failure.
</p><p>Later as the last plate was stored in the cupboard and Farquaharson hung
his dish towel on its rack, he said whimsically, "And to-morrow your
butler leaves your service. Are you going to give him references?"
</p><p>With a sudden break in her voice she wheeled on him.
</p><p>"Please, Stuart," she begged, "don't try to make jokes about it. It's
ghastly."
</p><p>Early in the evening Farquaharson's prophecy fulfilled itself and the
storm broke with a premature ferocity of shrieking winds, and endless
play of lightning and torrents of rain. Against the French windows of
the living-room, where they sat, came a pelting like shot against the
glass.
</p><p>"Conscience," said Stuart gravely, when the talk had for a time run in
uneven fits and starts, "I know your views by now, and you know mine.
But I want you to realize this: it's not your cause that I obey or
love--it's <u>you</u>."
</p><p>He paused for a moment, then went on: "You told me last night that you
were helpless. I want you to recognize that you have been splendidly
victorious--all through: because you are splendid yourself. It's a
victory that's costing us all the happiness out of life, perhaps, but it
oughtn't to leave you any room for self-reproach. You stood a long siege
and it was left for me to make the hardest and most cruel onslaught of
all on your overtaxed courage. I am sorry--and I capitulate--and I love
you."
</p><p>The clock in the hall struck nine and Conscience rose from her chair.
Her eyes filled with uncontrollable tears and her lips trembled at their
corners. The man bent forward, but, catching himself, he drew back and
waited.
</p><p>"Stuart, Stuart," she told him, "it's all so bleak--ahead! There are
things that I must say to you, too, but I can't say them now. We can't
sit here talking like this. It's like talking over the body of our dead
happiness."
</p><p>"I know," he replied in a strained voice. "It's just like that."
</p><p>"I'm going to my room," she declared. "Perhaps I can write it all more
easily than I can say it. Do you mind?"
</p><p>"No." He shook his head. "I think it's better--but you must sleep
to-night. Have you anything to take?"
</p><p>"I have trional--but maybe I won't need it."
</p><p>He closed the windows and shot the bolt of the front door; then, at the
head of the stairs, they both paused.
</p><p>"I would like to kiss you good-night," he said with a queer smile,
"but--"
</p><p>"But what?" she asked, and with their eyes meeting in full honesty he
answered: "But--I don't dare."
</p><p>Conscience's own room was at the front and right of the house,
overlooking the cove and the road. Stuart's was at the back and left,
separated by the length of the hall and by several rooms now empty.
</p><p>For a long while after she had switched on her lights the woman sat in
an attitude of limp and tearless distress. She could not yet attack the
task of that letter which was to explain so much.
</p><p>But finally she made a beginning.
</p>
<pre>
     "Dearest," she wrote, "(because it would only be dishonest to call
     you anything else), I am trying to write the things I couldn't say
     to you. You know and I know that if we acknowledged loving each
     other, when I have no right to love you, at least it has been a
     love that has been innocent in everything except its existence.
     When we look back on it, and try, as we must, to forget it, there
     will be no ghosts of guilty remembrance to haunt us. We loved each
     other in childhood, almost, and we loved each other until we let a
     misunderstanding separate us. I'm afraid, dear, I shall always love
     you, and yet I shall be more proud than ashamed when I look back on
     this time here together. Perhaps I should be ashamed of loving you
     at all, while I am the wife of a man who is good and who trusts me.
     But I am proud that you proved big enough to help me when I needed
     you. I shall be proud that when I was too weak to fight for myself
     you fought for me. I am proud that there was never a moment which
     Eben might not have seen, or one which he would have resented.
     "I am trying to think, and when one reaches the point of utter
     honesty with oneself, one sees things more clearly. I told you that
     I thought Eben himself had come to believe this marriage a failure.
     But now I see why more clearly.
     "It was my fault. I have been absolutely true to him in act, but
     perhaps, if I had let myself, I could after all have been true in a
     larger sense: in the sense of a better understanding. Perhaps I can
     still--and I mean to try.
     "I know that you distrust him, but since last night I have been
     thinking of his great generosity, and of what unfaltering trust he
     has had in me. A trust like that ought to have brought him an
     allegiance not only of form but of the heart itself.
     "Had he been a mean or suspicious man there were many
     circumstantial things that might have aroused his jealousy, but he
     has always been above jealousy.
     "We know that there has been no taint of guilt--that our love has
     been, by ordinary standards, entirely innocent. But to him it has
     all been giving--and receiving nothing.
     "From first to last he has trusted me. Leaving me here with you is
     a final demonstration of that trust--and he loves me.
     "I am writing about Eben because I want you, who are at heart so
     just, to be fair in your thought of him. In our decision to
     separate for all time--"</pre>

<p>There the pen faltered and Conscience had to rest for a moment.
</p>
<pre>
     "--you would not think the more of me, if you did not believe that
     I meant to carry the effort through to the end. I am going to begin
     over with what you call the hopeless experiment--and even now I
     think I have a chance ... a fighting chance of winning. If I have,
     I owe it to you."</pre>
