<p>Ned Chadmund's only fear was that the chief would hear the throbbing
of his heart. He dared not draw his head into the tree, fearing
that the action would attract the notice of the Apache; so he
remained as motionless as the trunk of the tree itself, waiting
for the danger to pass. Finally, the Indian was heard moving forward
again, and the cramped and aching fugitive began to breathe more
freely. He could detect that soft rippling through the water,
such as is made by an angler who is hunting some choice place
in the brook, and who examines every foot of the water which he
passes. At last it was beyond hearing, and all was still again;
but our young hero, impatient and anxious as he was to get forward,
dared not leave his concealment while so many of his enemies were
in the immediate neighborhood. He was confident that if he attempted
flight and escaped running against some of these dusky wretches,
they would speedily detect his trail and run him to the ground.
He concluded to remain where he was until dark, when he would
make another start, confident that by traveling all night, and
taking advantage of all the means that came in his way, he could
place a goodly distance between himself and the perilous neighborhood.</p>

<p>Nothing more was seen or heard of the Apaches during these long
waiting hours, unless the distant report of a gun could be construed
as their work, and the summer day gradually wore away. By this
time the condition of the boy was truly pitiable. He was thirsty
and nearly famished, feverish from his long abstinence. Yet with
water within a few feet of him he refrained, for the reason that
he was fearful of imperiling his safety.</p>

<p>"I'll wait till it is nearly dark," he said, as he looked down
at the cool water flowing beneath; "for this is the only chance
I shall ever have of giving them the slip."</p>

<p>The time he had fixed upon to venture forth had not yet arrived
when he observed a large tree floating along below him. It had
probably become displaced at some point up the stream, and would
drift along until it should again catch some obstruction, and
remain moored for an indefinite time. Yielding to a sudden inspiration,
Ned crept hastily out of his concealment, and dropped lightly
upon the trunk, which was heavy and buoyant enough to bear his
weight without sinking below the surface.</p>

<p>The course of the stream was such that this proceeding carried
him back directly over the ground that he had passed, and, in
case the Apaches were in camp, would take him near it. But there
was real woodcraft in this act, imprudent as it seemed; for nothing
could be conceived, which, if successful, would more effectually
throw the Indians off his trail. Knowing that he had gone northward,
what inducement could there be for looking toward the south for
him? The next thing after getting upon his raft was to stoop over
and get a drink from the stream, which, having its source up among
the mountains, was cold, clear, and pure.</p>

<p>Oh! the refreshing draught! None but those whose frames have
been consumed with flaming fever can appreciate the delicious
nectar, the invigorating, permeating life that lay in that wonderful
fluid, which is without smell, taste or color, and to which no
other liquid can be compared.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" groaned the lad, as he raised his head. "Another drink
like that and there'll be nothing left in the creek."</p>

<p>But thirst satisfied left him with such a tormenting sense of
hunger that the question of something to eat speedily became paramount
to all others. He almost ceased to think of Apaches in his wild
desire for something with which to satisfy the cravings within.</p>

<p>The heavy trunk, covered with a few knotty protuberances, kept
very nearly in the center of the stream and shifted on below the
wood, across the open space and around the curve which has been
already referred to, by which time it was fairly dark. Beyond
this he could discern the outlines of the grove in the encampment
of the day before, and where his own rush for liberty had been
made. Were the Apaches still there, awaiting the conclusion of
the hunt for him? This was the question, and, in his desire to
answer it, he carefully steadied himself until he stood upright
upon the log, so as to look across the intervening space to the
wood beyond.</p>

<p>"If they're there, they'd be sure to have a camp fire," was the
truthful conclusion; "but I can't catch sight of anything."</p>

<p>Had a point of light twinkled through the foliage, it is doubtful
whether he could have had the courage to continue on down the
stream to the point where it passed so close to the camp. No doubt
he would have dodged it. But all continued dark and silent, and
he was quite confident that they had gone. He crouched upon the
raft again, and drifted with the current.</p>

<p>As he neared the rapids and narrow places where the water dashed
over its rocky bed, it looked as if he would be unable to keep
his seat upon the raft; but as this was the very section, where,
above all others, he wished to keep his feet off the ground, he
grasped the limbs and held on. He went safely on, although considerable
water was splashed over him, and in a few minutes was in the broad,
smooth current below, and so close to the grove that he trembled
with fear.</p>

<p>In the dim moonlight he easily recognized the place, and for
a few seconds he believed he had committed a fatal error in retracing
his route in this fashion; but the silence remained unbroken,
and he began breathing more freely, when all at once one end of
the trunk struck the shore; the other end swung round, but it
remained fast, and his journey for a time was at an end.</p>

<p>Ned was dismayed and at a loss what to do, for the only way of
breaking loose that he could see was to step ashore and shove
off. He remained quiescent a moment or two, in the hope that the
raft would loosen itself; but, as it did not, he sprang ashore
for that purpose. As he did so, he looked around for some sign
of his enemies, but there was none, and the fact gave him assurance
that they had really gone.</p>

<p>"They must have had dinner there," was his conclusion, "and maybe
they have left something that I can make use of."</p>

<p>Encouraged by this hope, he moved over the intervening space,
and speedily reached the spot where Lone Wolf and his band had
encamped twenty hours before. As he had taken his departure from
the savages before dinner, he was not really certain that that
important meal had taken place; but he made diligent search, resolved
that he would find out beyond all peradventure. The very best
good fortune attended him. He had hunted but a few minutes, when
he trod among the ashes where the camp fire had been burning.
This proved that a meal had been partaken of, and in this country,
so prodigal in the different species of game, the Indians were
not economical in the use of food. Groping around in the dark,
his hands soon came upon a goodly-sized bone, plentifully covered
with meat, which had not been cooked so that it could be called
overdone. A starving wolf could not have devoured this with greater
gusto than did he, nor could a dozen starving wolves have enjoyed
it more than did the poor fellow who had been so long without
any nourishment.</p>

<p>When it was gnawed clean he hunted around for more. There was
no lack of the material, and Ned was thankful beyond expression
for this wonderful piece of good fortune, by which he had escaped
from Lone Wolf and his warriors, and then, when starving, had
obtained the food he needed from them. He ate and ate, and then
rested and ate again, until he had gormandized himself to his
utmost capacity, when with a sigh of happiness, he rose to his
feet, and stole back toward the stream where he had left his craft.
It was found there as if waiting expressly for his return, and,
shoving it loose, he made his way to near the middle, where he
crouched down and looked around with a feeling of misgiving and
fear.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it can hold me after such a supper? It is a little
lower in the water, but I guess it can stand it."</p>

<p>Whither the stream was tending was a question for the wanderer
to consider; but as he was without any possible means of determining,
he did not devote much time to the consideration thereof. His
purpose was to get ahead without leaving a trail behind, and that
was what he was doing.</p>
