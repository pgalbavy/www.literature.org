<p>About a hundred and fifty feet above them, almost perpendicularly
upward, stood an antelope, its small neck outstretched, and its
dark, beautiful eyes fixed upon them with a wondering expression.
It was on the very edge of a projecting rock where one step more
would bring it over.</p>

<p>"It is jist the jintleman we wants," whispered Tim, fearful that
he would alarm the timid animal. "We've ate but once in twenty-four
hours, and I've jist learned from me stomach that it would have
no objection to breaking the same fast; so do yez jist kape still
till I pops him over."</p>

<p>"Can you hit him?" asked Howard, scarcely less excited than his
companion.</p>

<p>"Be aisy now till ye see the scientific manner I takes to doot."</p>

<p>"Well, be quick, for he is likely to vanish any moment."</p>

<p>Tim O'Rooney carefully sighted his rifle, took a quick, steady
aim, and pulled the trigger. Howard, who was keenly watching the
antelope, saw it spring up, and as it came down it missed the
cliff and fell almost at their very feet with a violence and crash
which must have broken half the bones in its body.</p>

<p>"Arrah now, an' wasn't that done nicely?" exclaimed Tim, in great
exultation, as he ran up to the animal with his knife.</p>

<p>"Are you going to dress it?"</p>

<p>"Yis; an' do yez gather what sticks an' stuff ye can, an' we'll
have him cooked in a jiffy."</p>

<p>Howard set about it, for he understood the wisdom of providing
themselves with food in the prosecution of this hunt, which in
all probability would employ them for some time to come.</p>

<p>"Now, I will give the signal," said he, when his work was completed.
"If he is within hearing he will answer it."</p>

<p>"Yis; do your bist, while I pays my respects to this gintleman,
an' do ye do the listenin' while ye are about it, for I'm so taken
up with this job that I haven't the time to attend to that aither."</p>

<p>Howard strained his cheeks nearly to bursting, and completely
exhausted himself in giving forth those ringing screeches which
seem to come natural to all school-boys, and are made by uniting
the ends of two fingers, inserting them between the lips, and
blowing with all the might.</p>

<p>He listened&mdash;listened&mdash;listened&mdash;and then repeated the signal
with a desperate fierceness that left him no strength at all;
but all in vain&mdash;the echoes died away among the rocks and hills,
but no answer came back.</p>

<p>"It's no use," remarked Tim O'Rooney, who despite what he had
said was listening as earnestly as his young friend.</p>

<p>"The youngster don't hear us. We've got to make a hunt through
this old place, and afore we begins it we'll take something for
the stomach's sake."</p>

<p>The fire was kindled in the usual manner, and the dinner was
not unskillfully prepared by the Irishman. They ate all they could
hold. The dog did the same. Tim lit his pipe, and then declared
that he was ready for any duty that might be required of him.</p>

<p>As they rose to their feet they were somewhat alarmed at the
appearance of the sky. It was overspread with dark, threatening
clouds, from which issued rumbling peals of thunder and arrowy
lines of lightning. They became darker and more tumultuous each
moment, until semi-darkness shrouded them.</p>

<p>"We are going to have a storm," remarked Howard.</p>

<p>"Yis; and a good-sized one, too."</p>

<p>"We shall have to find shelter for ourselves. If much rain falls,
this gorge looks to me as if it will be filled with water."</p>

<p>"Worrah, now, but yez are a smart child!" exclaimed Tim O'Rooney,
looking admiringly at the boy. "Scarcely mesilf would have thought
of the same, and what a credit, therefore, that it should have
come into your own."</p>

<p>"I see nothing so wonderful about that. Almost any one would
see the danger we are in if we remain here when there is much
rain falling. It is just the place for a stream of water."</p>

<p>"So it is&mdash;so it is; and yez can saa that there has wather been
running over the stones upon which we are standing."</p>

<p>The storm which was so near at hand admonished them to lose no
time in seeking shelter. This was a matter of small difficulty,
as in such a wild, rugged place there were any number of retreats.
They clambered up the path and over the rocks until they reached
a point higher yet than where the antelope had stood when pierced
by the bullet that had tumbled him over the cliff. They had brought
a goodly portion of his meat with them, for there was no telling
when they would dare fire a gun again.</p>

<p>A gaping, overhanging ledge, which fortunately was turned from
the direction of the storm, was selected as their house, and here
they and the dog nestled and waited for the storm to burst. A
few large drops that cracked smartly upon the rocks and stones,
was the herald of the coming deluge; and then, at the same moment,
with a terrific flash and report, came the rain in torrents.</p>

<p>They stood and watched the storm as it raged, and when there
was a momentary cessation Howard threw his blanket over his head
and said:</p>

<p>"I will run out to the edge of that rock and see whether there
is any water in the place where we took our dinner."</p>

<p>"Be careful yez don't tumble over," admonished Tim, feeling it
his duty to say something.</p>

<p>"Never fear."</p>

<p>Howard stepped hastily to the spot and looked carefully over.
A tiny stream was just beginning to run through the path they
had occupied, which was increasing each moment, and would speedily
reach the proportions of a torrent. But, although he saw this,
there was something which interested him still more, and that
was a party of five Indians attentively examining the remains
of the antelope, and the signs around it, as if they were seeking
their explanation. They looked down to the ground, and two of
them pointed precisely in the direction which Tim and Howard had
taken in leaving the place.</p>

<p>The rain began falling again more copiously than ever, but Howard
would not have heeded it had he not been shrouded in the water-proof
blanket. Those Indians had found their camp-fire and were at that
moment discussing the best method of capturing him and Tim; but
the rain came down so furiously that they finally darted away
to seek shelter, and Howard thereupon hurried back to his friend
and told him all that he had seen.</p>

<p>"That settles the matter," he added. "Elwood is in their hands,
and if we aint careful we shall be with him, for they are searching
for us."</p>

<p>"But they can't find us&mdash;that they can't."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"This rain will wipe out our tracks as aisy as if yees had taken
a cloth and done it yourself."</p>

<p>"That is true."</p>

<p>Howard was greatly relieved when he reflected that this was true,
and that he and Tim were in no danger of capture from being pursued.</p>

<p>The storm lasted several hours, and when it was finished they
came cautiously forth and made their way stealthily back to where
they had left the canoe. They had deliberated long and earnestly
regarding Elwood Brandon, and neither of them had any doubt but
what he was in the hands of Indians. They had little fear of his
being put to death, but believed he would be held a prisoner until
either rescued by Shasta, or a party could be sent from the nearest
post to ransom him. They had concluded to make all haste homeward
and adopt this method of rescue.</p>

<p>And now, as they had given him up for a while, it is high time
we took him in hand.</p>
