<p>"I'm not afraid. I am afraid. I'm not afraid. I am afraid. I'm
not afraid."</p>

<p>Chatterer kept saying these two things over and over and over
again to himself. You see, he really was afraid, and he was trying
to make himself believe that he wasn't afraid. He thought that
perhaps if he said ever and ever so many times that he wasn't
afraid, he might actually make himself believe it. The trouble
was that every time he said it, a little voice, a little, truthful
voice down inside, seemed to speak right up and tell him that
he was afraid.</p>

<p>Poor Chatterer! It hurt his pride to have to own to himself that
he wasn't as brave as little Tommy Tit the Chickadee. His common
sense told him that there was no reason in the world why he shouldn't
be. Tommy Tit went every day and took food from the hand of Farmer
Brown's boy. It seemed to Chatterer, and to Happy Jack the Gray
Squirrel, and to Peter Rabbit, and to Sammy Jay, and to Blacky
the Crow, all of whom had seen him do it, as if it were the very
bravest thing they ever had seen, and their respect for Tommy
Tit grew wonderfully.</p>

<p>But Tommy Tit himself didn't think it brave at all. No, Sir,
Tommy knew better. You see, he has a great deal of common sense
under the little black cap he wears.</p>

<p>"It may have been brave of me to do it the first time," thought
he to himself, when the others told him how brave they thought
him, "but it isn't brave of me now, because I know that no harm
is going to come to me from Farmer Brown's boy. There isn't any
bravery about it, and it might be just the same way with Chatterer
and all the other little forest and meadow people, if only they
would think so, and give Farmer Brown's boy half a chance."</p>

<p>Chatterer was beginning to have some such thoughts himself, as
he tried to make himself think that he wasn't afraid. He heard
the door of Farmer Brown's house slam and peeped out from the
old stone wall. There was Farmer Brown's boy with a big, fat hickory
nut held out in the most tempting way, and Farmer Brown's boy
was whistling the same gentle little whistle he had used when
Chatterer was his prisoner, and he had brought good things for
Chatterer to eat. Of course Chatterer knew perfectly well that
that whistle was a call for him, and that that big fat hickory
nut was intended for him. Almost before he thought, he had left
the old stone wall and was half way over to Farmer Brown's boy.
Then he stopped short. It seemed as if that little voice inside
had fairly shouted in his ears: "I am afraid."</p>

<p>It was true; he was afraid. He was right on the very point of
turning to scurry back to the old stone wall, when he heard another
voice. This time it wasn't a voice inside. No, indeed! It was
a voice from the top of one of the apple-trees in the Old Orchard,
and this is what it said:</p>

<p>"Coward! Coward! Coward!"</p>

<p>It was Sammy Jay speaking.</p>

<p>Now it is one thing to tell yourself that you are afraid, and
it is quite another thing to be told by some one else that you
are afraid.</p>

<p>"No such thing! No such thing! I'm not afraid!" scolded Chatterer,
and then to prove it, he suddenly raced forward, snatched the
fat hickory nut from the hand of Farmer Brown's boy, and was back
in the old stone wall. It was hard to tell which was the most
surprised &mdash;Chatterer himself, Farmer Brown's boy, or Sammy
Jay.</p>

<p>"I did it! I did it! I did it!" boasted Chatterer.</p>

<p>"You don't dare do it again, though!" said Sammy Jay, in the
most provoking and unpleasant way.</p>

<p>"I do too!" snapped Chatterer, and he did it. And with the taking
of that second fat nut from the hand of Farmer Brown's boy, the
very last bit of fear of him left Chatterer, and he knew that
Tommy Tit the Chickadee had been right all the time when he insisted
that there was nothing to fear from Farmer Brown's boy.</p>

<p>"Why," thought Chatterer, "if I would have let him, he would
have been my friend long ago!" And so he would have.</p>

<p>And this is all about Chatterer the Red Squirrel for now. Sammy
Jay insists that it is his turn now, and so the next book will
be about his adventures.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>
