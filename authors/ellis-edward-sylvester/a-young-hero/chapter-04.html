<p>The sisters Perkinpine always retired early, and, candle in hand,
they made the round of the windows and doors on the first floor.</p>

<p>When they came to the window from which the nail had been removed,
Fred told them he had seen the tramp take it out, and he was sure
he would try and enter there.</p>

<p>This served to add to the uneasiness of the sisters, but they
had great confidence in the security of the house, which had never
been disturbed by burglars, so far as they knew, in all its long
history.</p>

<p>"The chest where we keep the silver and what little money we
have," said Lizzie, "is up-stairs, next to the spare bed-room."</p>

<p>"Leave the door open and let me sleep there," said Fred, stoutly.</p>

<p>"Gracious alive, what can you do if they should come?" was the
amazed inquiry.</p>

<p>"I don't know as I can do anything, but I can try; I want that
old musket that's over the fire-place, too."</p>

<p>"Why, it will go off and kill you."</p>

<p>Fred insisted so strongly, however, that he was allowed to climb
upon a chair and take down the antiquated weapon, covered with
rust and dust.</p>

<p>When he came to examine it he found that the description he had
heard was correct&mdash;the ancient flintlock was good for nothing,
and the barrel, when last discharged, must have exploded at the
breach, for it was twisted and split open, so that a load of powder
could only injure the one who might fire it, were such a feat
possible.</p>

<p>The sisters showed as much fear of it when it was taken down
as though it were in good order, primed and cocked, and they begged
the lad to restore it to its place as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>But he seemed to think he had charge of the business for the
evening, and, bidding them good-night, he took his candle and
went to his room, which he had occupied once or twice before.</p>

<p>It may well be asked what young Fred Sheldon expected to do with
such a useless musket, should emergency arise demanding a weapon.</p>

<p>Indeed, the boy would have found it hard to tell himself, excepting
that he hoped to scare the man or men away by the pretence of
a power which he did not possess.</p>

<p>Now that the young hero was finally left alone, he felt that
he had a most serious duty to perform.</p>

<p>The spare bedroom which was placed at his disposal was a large,
old-fashioned apartment, with two windows front and rear, with
a door opening into the next room, somewhat smaller in size, both
being carpeted, while the smaller contained nothing but a few
chairs and a large chest, in which were silver and money worth
several thousand dollars.</p>

<p>"I'll set the candle in there on the chest," concluded Fred,
"and I'll stay in here with the gun. If he comes up-stairs and
gets into the room I'll try and make him believe I've got a loaded
rifle to shoot him with."</p>

<p>The door opening outward from each apartment had nothing but
the old-style iron latch, large and strong, and fastened in place
by turning down a small iron tongue.</p>

<p>It would take much effort to force such a door, but Fred had
no doubt any burglar could do it, even though it were ten times
as strong. He piled chairs against both, and then made an examination
of the windows.</p>

<p>To his consternation, the covered porch extending along the front
of the house, passed beneath every window, and was so low that
it would be a very easy thing to step from the hypostyle to the
entrance.</p>

<p>The room occupied by the ladies was in another part of the building,
and much more inaccessible.</p>

<p>Young as Fred Sheldon was, he could not help wondering how it
was that where everything was so inviting to burglars they had
not visited these credulous and trusting sisters before.</p>

<p>"If that tramp, that I don't believe is a tramp, tries to get
into the house he'll do it by one of the windows, for that one
is fastened down stairs, and all he has to do is to climb up the
portico and crawl in here."</p>

<p>The night was so warm that Fred thought he would smother when
he had fastened all the windows down, and he finally compromised
by raising one of those at the back of the house, where he was
sure there was the least danger of any one entering.</p>

<p>This being done, he sat down in a chair, with the rusty musket
in his hand, and began his watch.</p>

<p>From his position he could see the broad, flat candlestick standing
on the chest, with the dip already burned so low that it was doubtful
whether it could last an hour longer.</p>

<p>"What's the use of that burning, anyway?" he asked himself; "that
fellow isn't afraid to come in, and the candle will only serve
to show him the way."</p>

<p>Acting under the impulse, he walked softly through the door to
where the yellow light was burning, and with one puff extinguished
it.</p>

<p>The wick glowed several minutes longer, sending out a strong
odor, which pervaded both rooms. Fred watched it until all became
darkness, and then he was not sure he had done a wise thing after
all.</p>

<p>The trees on both sides of the house were so dense that their
leaves shut out nearly all the moonlight which otherwise would
have entered the room. Only a few rays came through the window
of the other apartment, and these, striking the large, square
chest showed its dim outlines, with the phantom-like candlestick
on top.</p>

<p>Where Fred himself sat it was dark and gloomy, and his situation,
we are sure all will admit, was enough to try the nerves of the
strongest man, even if furnished with a good weapon of offence
and defence.</p>

<p>"I hope the ladies will sleep," was the unselfish thought of
the little hero, "for there isn't any use of their being disturbed
when they can't do anything but scream, and a robber don't care
for that."</p>

<p>One of the hardest things is to keep awake when exhausted by
some unusual effort of the bodily or mental powers, and we all
know under how many conditions it is utterly impossible.</p>

<p>The sentinel on the outpost or the watch on deck fights off his
drowsiness by steadily pacing back and forth. If he sits down
for a few minutes he is sure to succumb.</p>

<p>When Fremont, the pathfinder, was lost with his command in the
Rocky Mountains, and was subjected to such arctic rigors in the
dead of winter as befell the crew of the Jeannette in the ice-resounding
oceans of the far north the professor, who accompanied the expedition
for the purpose of making scientific investigations, warned all
that their greatest peril lay in yielding to the drowsiness which
the extreme cold would be sure to bring upon them. He begged them
to resist it with all the energy of their natures, for in no other
way could they escape with their lives.</p>

<p>And yet this same professor was the first one of the party to
give up and to lie down for his last long sleep, from which it
was all Fremont could do to arouse him.</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon felt that everything depended on him, and with the
exaggerated fears that come to a youngster at such a time he was
sure that if he fell asleep the evil man would enter the room,
take all the money and plate and then sacrifice him.</p>

<p>"I could keep awake a week," he muttered, as he tipped his chair
back against the wall, so as to rest easier, while he leaned the
musket along side of him, in such position that it could be seized
at a moment's warning.</p>

<p>The night remained solemn and still. Far in the distance he could
hear the flow of the river, and from the forest, less than a mile
away, seemed to come a murmur, like the "voice of silence" itself.</p>

<p>Now and then the crowing of a cock was answered by another a
long distance off, and occasionally the soft night wind stirred
the vegetation surrounding the house.</p>

<p>But among them all was no sound which the excited imagination
could torture into such as would be made by a stealthy entrance
into the house.</p>

<p>In short, everything was of the nature to induce sleep, and it
was not yet ten o'clock when Fred began to wink, very slowly and
solemnly, his grasp on the ruined weapon relaxed, his head bobbed
forward several times and at last he was asleep.</p>

<p>As his mind had been so intensely occupied by thoughts of burglars
and their evil doings, his dreams were naturally of the same unpleasant
personages.</p>

<p>In his fancy he was sitting on the treasure-chest, unable to
move, while an ogre-like creature climbed into the window, slowly
raised an immense club and then brought it down on the head of
the boy with a terrific crash.</p>

<p>With an exclamation of terror Fred awoke, and found that he had
fallen forward on his face, sprawling on the floor at full length,
while the jar tipped the musket over so that it fell across him.</p>

<p>In his dream it had seemed that the burglar was a full hour climbing
upon the roof and through the window, and yet the whole vision
began and ended during the second or two occupied in falling from
his chair.</p>

<p>In the confusion of the moment Fred was sure the man he dreaded
was in the room, but when he had got back into the chair he was
gratified beyond measure to find his mistake.</p>

<p>"I'm a pretty fellow to keep watch," he muttered, rubbing his
eyes; "I don't suppose that I was awake more than a half hour.
It must be past midnight, so I've had enough sleep to last me
without any more of it before to-morrow night."</p>

<p>He resumed his seat, never more wide awake in all his life. It
was not as late as he supposed, but the hour had come when it
was all-important that he should keep his senses about him.</p>

<p>Hearing nothing unusual he rose to his feet and walked to the
rear window and looked out. It was somewhat cooler and a gentle
breeze felt very pleasant on his fevered face. The same stillness
held reign, and he moved to the front, where he took a similar
view.</p>

<p>So far as could be told, everything was right and he resumed
his seat.</p>

<p>But at this juncture Fred was startled by a sound, the meaning
of which he well knew.</p>

<p>Some one was trying hard to raise the dining-room window&mdash;the
rattling being such that there was no mistake about it.</p>

<p>"It's that tramp!" exclaimed the boy, all excitement, stepping
softly into the next room and listening at the head of the stairs,
"and he's trying the window that he took the nail out of."</p>

<p>The noise continued several minutes&mdash;long after the time, indeed,
when the tramp must have learned that his trick had been discovered&mdash;and
then all became still.</p>

<p>This window was the front, and Fred, in the hope of scaring the
fellow away, raised the sash, and, leaning out, peered into the
darkness and called out:</p>

<p>"Halloo, down there! What do you want?"</p>

<p>As may be supposed, there was no answer, and after waiting a
minute or two, Fred concluded to give a warning.</p>

<p>"If I hear anything more of you, I'll try and shoot; I've got
a gun here and we're ready for you!"</p>

<p>This threat ought to have frightened an ordinary person away,
and the boy was not without a strong hope that it had served that
purpose with the tramp whom he dreaded so much.</p>

<p>He thought he could discern his dark figure among the trees,
but it was probably fancy, for the gloom was too great for his
eyes to be of any use in that respect.</p>

<p>Fred listened a considerable while longer, and then, drawing
his head within, said:</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if I had scared him off&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then a soft step roused him, and turning his head, he saw
that the very tramp of whom he was thinking and of whom he believed
he was happily rid, had entered the room, and was standing within
a few feet of him.</p>
