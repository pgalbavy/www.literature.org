AN EAGLE, flying down from his perch on a lofty rock, seized upon
a lamb and carried him aloft in his talons.  A Jackdaw, who
witnessed the capture of the lamb, was stirred with envy and
determined to emulate the strength and flight of the Eagle.  He
flew around with a great whir of his wings and settled upon a
large ram, with the intention of carrying him off, but his claws
became entangled in the ram's fleece and he was not able to
release himself, although he fluttered with his feathers as much
as he could.  The shepherd, seeing what had happened, ran up and
caught him.  He at once clipped the Jackdaw's wings, and taking
him home at night, gave him to his children.  On their saying,
"Father, what kind of bird is it?'  he replied, "To my certain
knowledge he is a Daw; but he would like you to think an Eagle."
