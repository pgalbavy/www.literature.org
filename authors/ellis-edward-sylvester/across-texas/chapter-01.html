<p><em>NICK RIBSAM, </em>of whom I had considerable to tell you
in "The Young Moose Hunters," returned to his humble home in Western
Pennsylvania with his health fully restored by his stirring experience
in the mountainous forests of Maine. He was naturally strong and
active, and one glance at his bright eyes, his ruddy cheeks, and
his alert movements told his sister Nellie and the beloved father
and mother that the prescription of the physician had worked like
a charm.</p>

<p>Nick was now a sturdy youth, a bright scholar and a general favorite
with all who knew him. His parents were not of the kind that are
demonstrative, but their hearts were wrapped up in their worthy
son, and they were full of gratitude that he should come back
to them at the end of what, after all, was only a brief absence,
without a trace of the weakness that caused them so much misgiving
when he went away.</p>

<p>They felt a strong friendship and affection, too, for Herbert
Watrous and his parents, through whose kindness the trip down
East was brought about. There was no "discounting" the fondness
of the Watrouses for the manly youth. Mr. Watrous, as has been
shown, possessed large means, and denied his son nothing, his
affection for Herbert leading him astray in that respect. But
he saw the great good done his boy through his association with
Nick. You know that the most forceful sermon ever preached is
that of example. It matters little what a person says, but it
is everything what he does. It is not the profession, but the
life which must be the test, as it certainly will be before the
final Judge of all mankind.</p>

<p>Mr. Watrous and his wife welcomed Herbert home, and their eyes
sparkled at sight of the immense stuffed moose forming a striking
trophy of the young man’s visit to Uncle Dick Musgrove. He could
not be blamed for feeling proud over his prize, and for having
a number of large photographs struck off and sent to his friends,
but that which touched the parents’ hearts was the change in Herbert
himself. He had always been fond of them, but with that feeling
was now mingled a tender respect that had been wanting before.
He never forgot their wishes; he showed a deeper interest in his
studies; he abandoned habits and associations which he knew his
parents disliked; he made a confidant of his father as well as
his mother, and consulted with them and asked their counsel in
whatever important step he had in mind.</p>

<p>Now, what had wrought this change in Herbert Watrous? Nick had
done very little "preaching" to him. True, whenever the chance
was inviting, he dropped a word or two that clinched an important
principle, and now and then, when their long talks took a favorable
drift, he gave his views with a power and point that could not
be mistaken, but it was the daily life of Nick that did the blessed
work.</p>

<p>A family holding the social position of Mr. Watrous in New York
has no lack of privileges for a son; but there was nothing that
gave Herbert the genuine pleasure that he gained by a visit to
Nick Ribsam, in his quiet country home in Western Pennsylvania.
The pure air, the healthful food, the perfect cooking, the cleanliness
that was everywhere, the cheerfulness, the mutual love and confidence,
the warm welcome from everyone—these brought to him an enjoyment
and satisfaction far beyond what mere wealth can buy.</p>

<p>It was during the early autumn succeeding the incidents told
in "The Moose Hunters," that Herbert paid his second visit to
Nick. The latter met him at the railway station, but the delight
of welcoming his old friend to his country home was sadly marred
by the appearance of Herbert. Beyond a doubt he was in a bad way.
He was nearly six feet tall, very slim, with a flushed face, a
dragging walk, short breath, and, indeed, with every sign of incipient
consumption.</p>

<p>"I know what you are thinking about," said he, with a wan smile,
"but I don’t look any worse than I feel."</p>

<p>"You do look bad," replied Nick, as he drove homeward in their
old-fashioned carriage. "What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know; the doctor says I am growing too fast, have studied
too hard, and haven’t had enough exercise. You know I meant to
enter Yale this fall and have been boning like the mischief. But
I have given up that and postponed college for a year at least,
and," he added with a sigh, "perhaps forever."</p>

<p>"You mustn’t talk that way," said Nick, pained beyond expression;
"you must stop all study and live outdoors for a few weeks. You
have no bad habits, Herbert?"</p>

<p>"None at all, though I may be reaping the penalty of my former
foolishness; but I haven’t touched tobacco or alcohol in any form
for six months."</p>

<p>"I see no reason why you should not come out all right in a short
time," added Nick, uttering the wish rather than the belief he
felt.</p>

<p>"I have a letter in my pocket from my father to your father;
I know what is in it, but I will let him tell you himself."</p>

<p>Home being reached, the team put away, and a kind welcome given
to Herbert by Nellie and her parents, all sat down to the meal
awaiting them. At its conclusion, Herbert handed the letter he
bore to Mr. Ribsam, who curiously broke the seal.</p>

<p>When he saw it was written in English he smiled and passed it
to his son.</p>

<p>"I vill lets Nick read him, cause I don’t English reads as vell
as German as I don’t."</p>

<p>Nick took the missive and read aloud, the others listening attentively:</p>

<p>  "<em>NEW YORK, </em>October 13, 18—</p>

<p>  "MY <em>DEAR MR. RIBSAM</em>:</p>

<p> "My son Herbert has expressed the gratitude which his mother
and  myself will ever feel toward your noble son Nicholas, for
the  immeasurable good he has done my boy by his precept and example.
That  influence will follow him like a blessing through life,
and you and  your good wife are to be congratulated on having
such a worthy child.</p>

<p> "I am about to ask a great favor of you. We are alarmed for
Herbert’s  health. It is certainly singular that last winter it
was your  son whose condition was bad, while now it is my own
who is in a  condition that causes us the gravest alarm. I have
consulted the  best physicians in New York, who tell me that he
is threatened with  consumption; that medicine will not cure him,
but, like your own son  last year, he must give up his indoors
life at home and secure a  radical change of air and surroundings.</p>

<p> "I would arrange to have him spend a few weeks with you, where
I know  he is welcome, but the medical men tell me that he runs
a risk so long  as he is exposed to a northern climate, with its
sudden and violent  changes.</p>

<p> "We have considered the question of a sea voyage, and a winter
in  the Bermudas, the West Indies, or in Southern France; but
there are  objections to all these, the principal of which is
our dislike to  have him go out of our own country, where he would
have to meet a new  language, different kinds of people, and unfavorable
surroundings.</p>

<p> "The plan we have decided upon is to send him on a tour through
the  southwestern section of our own country. We have arranged
for him to  visit Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and Southern California,
hoping that  by the return of spring he will be so fully restored
to health that he  can come home as sound in body as your own
son.</p>

<p> "The favor I ask of you is that you will consent that Nicholas
shall  accompany him. I am aware that this is asking a great sacrifice
of  you, and I have hesitated a long time before putting the request
on  paper. You need your boy at home with you; it will cause you
and his  mother and sisters great misgiving to let him go away
for five or six  months, and no doubt involve considerable pecuniary
loss. Still, my  solicitude for my own child forces me to ask
this great sacrifice at  your hands.</p>

<p> "In doing so, there are several conditions upon which I shall
insist.  The first is that under no circumstances shall it cost
you or your son  a penny. My position in railway matters enables
me to secure, without  trouble, passes on the leading lines from
your home over the entire  route and return. These passes are
now in Herbert’s possession. Other  expenses will be involved,
as some of the travelling will have to be  done in stage coaches
and on horseback, to say nothing of the cost  of living. All this
is provided for. My son has letters to bankers  at various points
<em>en route</em> which will secure him ample funds. They  will
need no outfit until they reach San Antonio, and start further 
westward. It is my earnest wish that if Nicholas accompanies Herbert, 
doing so as his friend, companion, and, in one sense, his escort,
I  shall be permitted to make compensation therefor, as properly
due you  for loss of his valuable services.</p>

<p> "If you will consent that your son shall go with him, I advise
that  the start be made at once from your house. If you feel that
I am  presuming too much on your kindness do not hesitate to say
so, and I  will try to make other arrangements.</p>

<p> "I am, my dear sir, very truly yours,</p>

<p>  "J. H. <em>WATROUS</em>."</p>

<p>To quote a familiar expression, the reading of this letter produced
a sensation. Every eye was fixed on Nick, as he sat in his chair
with the missive in his hand, and pronounced the words in a clear
voice.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give the conversation that followed, for
it was a long one in which all shared, but late that afternoon
Nick harnessed up the old roan again and drove to the railway
station with Herbert. Hastily leaving the vehicle, they passed
into the telegraph office, where the city youth wrote out a telegram
addressed to his father, and it ran thus:</p>

<p> It is all fixed: Nick and I leave for Texas and the southwest 
to-morrow. Good-by, and love to you and mother.</p>

<p>  <em>HERBERT</em>.</p>
