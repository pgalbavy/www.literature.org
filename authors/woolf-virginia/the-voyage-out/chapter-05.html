<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>She was not able to follow up her observations, however, or to
come to any conclusion, for by one of those accidents which are
liable to happen at sea, the whole course of their lives was now
put out of order.</p>

<p>Even at tea the floor rose beneath their feet and pitched too
low again, and at dinner the ship seemed to groan and strain as
though a lash were descending. She who had been a broad-backed
dray-horse, upon whose hind-quarters pierrots might waltz, became
a colt in a field. The plates slanted away from the knives, and
Mrs. Dalloway's face blanched for a second as she helped herself
and saw the potatoes roll this way and that. Willoughby, of course,
extolled the virtues of his ship, and quoted what had been said
of her by experts and distinguished passengers, for he loved his
own possessions. Still, dinner was uneasy, and directly the ladies
were alone Clarissa owned that she would be better off in bed,
and went, smiling bravely.</p>

<p>Next morning the storm was on them, and no politeness could ignore
it. Mrs. Dalloway stayed in her room. Richard faced three meals,
eating valiantly at each; but at the third, certain glazed asparagus
swimming in oil finally conquered him.</p>

<p>"That beats me," he said, and withdrew.</p>

<p>"Now we are alone once more," remarked William Pepper, looking
round the table; but no one was ready to engage him in talk, and
the meal ended in silence.</p>

<p>On the following day they met&mdash;but as flying leaves meet in the
air. Sick they were not; but the wind propelled them hastily into
rooms, violently downstairs. They passed each other gasping on
deck; they shouted across tables. They wore fur coats; and Helen
was never seen without a bandanna on her head. For comfort they
retreated to their cabins, where with tightly wedged feet they
let the ship bounce and tumble. Their sensations were the sensations
of potatoes in a sack on a galloping horse. The world outside
was merely a violent grey tumult. For two days they had a perfect
rest from their old emotions. Rachel had just enough consciousness
to suppose herself a donkey on the summit of a moor in a hail-storm,
with its coat blown into furrows; then she became a wizened tree,
perpetually driven back by the salt Atlantic gale.</p>

<p>Helen, on the other hand, staggered to Mrs. Dalloway's door,
knocked, could not be heard for the slamming of doors and the
battering of wind, and entered.</p>

<p>There were basins, of course. Mrs. Dalloway lay half-raised on
a pillow, and did not open her eyes. Then she murmured, "Oh, Dick,
is that you?"</p>

<p>Helen shouted&mdash;for she was thrown against the washstand&mdash;"How
are you?"</p>

<p>Clarissa opened one eye. It gave her an incredibly dissipated
appearance. "Awful!" she gasped. Her lips were white inside.</p>

<p>Planting her feet wide, Helen contrived to pour champagne into
a tumbler with a tooth-brush in it.</p>

<p>"Champagne," she said.</p>

<p>"There's a tooth-brush in it," murmured Clarissa, and smiled;
it might have been the contortion of one weeping. She drank.</p>

<p>"Disgusting," she whispered, indicating the basins. Relics of
humour still played over her face like moonshine.</p>

<p>"Want more?" Helen shouted. Speech was again beyond Clarissa's
reach. The wind laid the ship shivering on her side. Pale agonies
crossed Mrs. Dalloway in waves. When the curtains flapped, grey
lights puffed across her. Between the spasms of the storm, Helen
made the curtain fast, shook the pillows, stretched the bed-clothes,
and smoothed the hot nostrils and forehead with cold scent.</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> good!" Clarissa gasped. "Horrid mess!"</p>

<p>She was trying to apologise for white underclothes fallen and
scattered on the floor. For one second she opened a single eye,
and saw that the room was tidy.</p>

<p>"That's nice," she gasped.</p>

<p>Helen left her; far, far away she knew that she felt a kind of
liking for Mrs. Dalloway. She could not help respecting her spirit
and her desire, even in the throes of sickness, for a tidy bedroom.
Her petticoats, however, rose above her knees.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly the storm relaxed its grasp. It happened at tea;
the expected paroxysm of the blast gave out just as it reached
its climax and dwindled away, and the ship instead of taking the
usual plunge went steadily. The monotonous order of plunging and
rising, roaring and relaxing, was interfered with, and every one
at table looked up and felt something loosen within them. The
strain was slackened and human feelings began to peep again, as
they do when daylight shows at the end of a tunnel.</p>

<p>"Try a turn with me," Ridley called across to Rachel.</p>

<p>"Foolish!" cried Helen, but they went stumbling up the ladder.
Choked by the wind their spirits rose with a rush, for on the
skirts of all the grey tumult was a misty spot of gold. Instantly
the world dropped into shape; they were no longer atoms flying
in the void, but people riding a triumphant ship on the back of
the sea. Wind and space were banished; the world floated like
an apple in a tub, and the mind of man, which had been unmoored
also, once more attached itself to the old beliefs.</p>

<p>Having scrambled twice round the ship and received many sound
cuffs from the wind, they saw a sailor's face positively shine
golden. They looked, and beheld a complete yellow circle of sun;
next minute it was traversed by sailing stands of cloud, and then
completely hidden. By breakfast the next morning, however, the
sky was swept clean, the waves, although steep, were blue, and
after their view of the strange under-world, inhabited by phantoms,
people began to live among tea-pots and loaves of bread with greater
zest than ever.</p>

<p>Richard and Clarissa, however, still remained on the borderland.
She did not attempt to sit up; her husband stood on his feet,
contemplated his waistcoat and trousers, shook his head, and then
lay down again. The inside of his brain was still rising and falling
like the sea on the stage. At four o'clock he woke from sleep
and saw the sunlight make a vivid angle across the red plush curtains
and the grey tweed trousers. The ordinary world outside slid into
his mind, and by the time he was dressed he was an English gentleman
again.</p>

<p>He stood beside his wife. She pulled him down to her by the lapel
of his coat, kissed him, and held him fast for a minute.</p>

<p>"Go and get a breath of air, Dick," she said. "You look quite
washed out. . . . How nice you smell! . . . And be polite to that
woman. She was so kind to me."</p>

<p>Thereupon Mrs. Dalloway turned to the cool side of her pillow,
terribly flattened but still invincible.</p>

<p>Richard found Helen talking to her brother-in-law, over two dishes
of yellow cake and smooth bread and butter.</p>

<p>"You look very ill!" she exclaimed on seeing him. "Come and have
some tea."</p>

<p>He remarked that the hands that moved about the cups were beautiful.</p>

<p>"I hear you've been very good to my wife," he said. "She's had
an awful time of it. You came in and fed her with champagne. Were
you among the saved yourself?"</p>

<p>"I? Oh, I haven't been sick for twenty years&mdash;sea-sick, I mean."</p>

<p>"There are three stages of convalescence, I always say," broke
in the hearty voice of Willoughby. "The milk stage, the bread-and-butter
stage, and the roast-beef stage. I should say you were at the
bread-and-butter stage." He handed him the plate.</p>

<p>"Now, I should advise a hearty tea, then a brisk walk on deck;
and by dinner-time you'll be clamouring for beef, eh?" He went
off laughing, excusing himself on the score of business.</p>

<p>"What a splendid fellow he is!" said Richard. "Always keen on
something."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Helen, "he's always been like that."</p>

<p>"This is a great undertaking of his," Richard continued. "It's
a business that won't stop with ships, I should say. We shall
see him in Parliament, or I'm much mistaken. He's the kind of
man we want in Parliament&mdash;the man who has done things."</p>

<p>But Helen was not much interested in her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"I expect your head's aching, isn't it?" she asked, pouring a
fresh cup.</p>

<p>"Well, it is," said Richard. "It's humiliating to find what a
slave one is to one's body in this world. D'you know, I can never
work without a kettle on the hob. As often as not I don't drink
tea, but I must feel that I can if I want to."</p>

<p>"That's very bad for you," said Helen.</p>

<p>"It shortens one's life; but I'm afraid, Mrs. Ambrose, we politicians
must make up our minds to that at the outset. We've got to burn
the candle at both ends, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've cooked your goose!" said Helen brightly.</p>

<p>"We can't make you take us seriously, Mrs. Ambrose," he protested.
"May I ask how you've spent your time? Reading&mdash;philosophy?" (He
saw the black book.) "Metaphysics and fishing!" he exclaimed.
"If I had to live again I believe I should devote myself to one
or the other." He began turning the pages.</p>

<p>"'Good, then, is indefinable,'" he read out. "How jolly to think
that's going on still! 'So far as I know there is only one ethical
writer, Professor Henry Sidgwick, who has clearly recognised and
stated this fact.' That's just the kind of thing we used to talk
about when we were boys. I can remember arguing until five in
the morning with Duffy&mdash;now Secretary for India&mdash;pacing round
and round those cloisters until we decided it was too late to
go to bed, and we went for a ride instead. Whether we ever came
to any conclusion&mdash;that's another matter. Still, it's the arguing
that counts. It's things like that that stand out in life. Nothing's
been quite so vivid since. It's the philosophers, it's the scholars,"
he continued, "they're the people who pass the torch, who keep
the light burning by which we live. Being a politician doesn't
necessarily blind one to that, Mrs. Ambrose."</p>

<p>"No. Why should it?" said Helen. "But can you remember if your
wife takes sugar?"</p>

<p>She lifted the tray and went off with it to Mrs. Dalloway.</p>

<p>Richard twisted a muffler twice round his throat and struggled
up on deck. His body, which had grown white and tender in a dark
room, tingled all over in the fresh air. He felt himself a man
undoubtedly in the prime of life. Pride glowed in his eye as he
let the wind buffet him and stood firm. With his head slightly
lowered he sheered round corners, strode uphill, and met the blast.
There was a collision. For a second he could not see what the
body was he had run into. "Sorry." "Sorry." It was Rachel who
apologised. They both laughed, too much blown about to speak.
She drove open the door of her room and stepped into its calm.
In order to speak to her, it was necessary that Richard should
follow. They stood in a whirlpool of wind; papers began flying
round in circles, the door crashed to, and they tumbled, laughing,
into chairs. Richard sat upon Bach.</p>

<p>"My word! What a tempest!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Fine, isn't it?" said Rachel. Certainly the struggle and wind
had given her a decision she lacked; red was in her cheeks, and
her hair was down.</p>

<p>"Oh, what fun!" he cried. "What am I sitting on? Is this your
room? How jolly!" "There&mdash;sit there," she commanded. Cowper slid
once more.</p>

<p>"How jolly to meet again," said Richard. "It seems an age. <em>Cowper's
Letters</em>? . . . Bach? . . . <em>Wuthering Heights</em>? .
. . Is this where you meditate on the world, and then come out
and pose poor politicians with questions? In the intervals of
sea-sickness I've thought a lot of our talk. I assure you, you
made me think."</p>

<p>"I made you think! But why?"</p>

<p>"What solitary icebergs we are, Miss Vinrace! How little we can
communicate! There are lots of things I should like to tell you
about&mdash;to hear your opinion of. Have you ever read Burke?"</p>

<p>"Burke?" she repeated. "Who was Burke?"</p>

<p>"No? Well, then I shall make a point of sending you a copy. <em>The</em>
<em>Speech</em> <em>on</em> <em>the</em> <em>French</em> <em>Revolution</em>&mdash;<em>The</em>
<em>American</em> <em>Rebellion</em>? Which shall it be, I wonder?"
He noted something in his pocket-book. "And then you must write
and tell me what you think of it. This reticence&mdash;this isolation&mdash;that's
what's the matter with modern life! Now, tell me about yourself.
What are your interests and occupations? I should imagine that
you were a person with very strong interests. Of course you are!
Good God! When I think of the age we live in, with its opportunities
and possibilities, the mass of things to be done and enjoyed&mdash;why
haven't we ten lives instead of one? But about yourself?"</p>

<p>"You see, I'm a woman," said Rachel.</p>

<p>"I know &mdash;I know," said Richard, throwing his head back,
and drawing his fingers across his eyes.</p>

<p>"How strange to be a woman! A young and beautiful woman," he
continued sententiously, "has the whole world at her feet. That's
true, Miss Vinrace. You have an inestimable power&mdash;for good or
for evil. What couldn't you do&mdash;" he broke off.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Rachel.</p>

<p>"You have beauty," he said. The ship lurched. Rachel fell slightly
forward. Richard took her in his arms and kissed her. Holding
her tight, he kissed her passionately, so that she felt the hardness
of his body and the roughness of his cheek printed upon hers.
She fell back in her chair, with tremendous beats of the heart,
each of which sent black waves across her eyes. He clasped his
forehead in his hands.</p>

<p>"You tempt me," he said. The tone of his voice was terrifying.
He seemed choked in fright. They were both trembling. Rachel stood
up and went. Her head was cold, her knees shaking, and the physical
pain of the emotion was so great that she could only keep herself
moving above the great leaps of her heart. She leant upon the
rail of the ship, and gradually ceased to feel, for a chill of
body and mind crept over her. Far out between the waves little
black and white sea-birds were riding. Rising and falling with
smooth and graceful movements in the hollows of the waves they
seemed singularly detached and unconcerned.</p>

<p>"You're peaceful," she said. She became peaceful too, at the
same time possessed with a strange exultation. Life seemed to
hold infinite possibilities she had never guessed at. She leant
upon the rail and looked over the troubled grey waters, where
the sunlight was fitfully scattered upon the crests of the waves,
until she was cold and absolutely calm again. Nevertheless something
wonderful had happened.</p>

<p>At dinner, however, she did not feel exalted, but merely uncomfortable,
as if she and Richard had seen something together which is hidden
in ordinary life, so that they did not like to look at each other.
Richard slid his eyes over her uneasily once, and never looked
at her again. Formal platitudes were manufactured with effort,
but Willoughby was kindled.</p>

<p>"Beef for Mr. Dalloway!" he shouted. "Come now&mdash;after that walk
you're at the beef stage, Dalloway!"</p>

<p>Wonderful masculine stories followed about Bright and Disraeli
and coalition governments, wonderful stories which made the people
at the dinner-table seem featureless and small. After dinner,
sitting alone with Rachel under the great swinging lamp, Helen
was struck by her pallor. It once more occurred to her that there
was something strange in the girl's behaviour.</p>

<p>"You look tired. Are you tired?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not tired," said Rachel. "Oh, yes, I suppose I am tired."</p>

<p>Helen advised bed, and she went, not seeing Richard again. She
must have been very tired for she fell asleep at once, but after
an hour or two of dreamless sleep, she dreamt. She dreamt that
she was walking down a long tunnel, which grew so narrow by degrees
that she could touch the damp bricks on either side. At length
the tunnel opened and became a vault; she found herself trapped
in it, bricks meeting her wherever she turned, alone with a little
deformed man who squatted on the floor gibbering, with long nails.
His face was pitted and like the face of an animal. The wall behind
him oozed with damp, which collected into drops and slid down.
Still and cold as death she lay, not daring to move, until she
broke the agony by tossing herself across the bed, and woke crying
"Oh!"</p>

<p>Light showed her the familiar things: her clothes, fallen off
the chair; the water jug gleaming white; but the horror did not
go at once. She felt herself pursued, so that she got up and actually
locked her door. A voice moaned for her; eyes desired her. All
night long barbarian men harassed the ship; they came scuffling
down the passages, and stopped to snuffle at her door. She could
not sleep again.</p>
