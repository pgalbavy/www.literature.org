<p>ERB admitted, at an elocution lesson in Camberwell, that the settlement
of the Willow Walk affair had given him a good jerk forward.  There was
always now a quarter of an hour between the close of his time and the
appearance of the next pupil—a quarter of an hour generally occupied by a
soliloquy from Erb, prefaced by the cue from Rosalind.  “Well now, tell
me what you’ve been doing this week.”  She had some of the important
security that comes to an engaged young woman, and Erb, who looked
forward to this weekly exchange of confidences, forced himself to ask
politely after Mr. Lawrence Railton, of the “Sin’s Reward” Company, and
when Rosalind answered (as she usually did) with a sigh that Mr. Railton
had not written for some time, Erb made excuses for him on various
grounds, such as that he was probably over-occupied with the work of his
profession, that a man in Mr. Railton’s place had to be here, there and
everywhere, that it being sometimes the gentleman’s affectionate habit to
scribble a hurried postcard to his <u>fiancée</u> on the Sunday journeys,
likely enough there would be a letter next Monday.  On this Rosalind
would brighten very much, and sing cheerful words of praise of Mr.
Railton, who occupied, it seemed, a unique and delicate position, in that
he was much too good for the provinces and not quite good enough for
town; nevertheless, “Sin’s Reward” had booked a week for the Surrey, and
the young woman’s bright eyes danced at the thought of seeing him again.
Mr. Railton’s real name was Botts, which was held to be unattractive as a
name on the bills; his father was a silver chaser in Clerkenwell, and it
was generally understood that Mr. Railton had had to cut off his parents
with a shilling on the grounds that they insisted on calling him Sammy.
</p>
<p>Walking home after this fifteen minutes of happiness, Erb found himself
continuing the talk, and affecting that Rosalind was tripping along at
his side: it was in these silent talks that he dared to call her “dear,”
thereupon colouring so much that passers-by glanced at him curiously;
plain-faced ladies went on gay with the thought that their features had
the power to confuse a stranger.  When, in these circumstances, he
encountered men of the society they were sometimes greatly diverted, and
cried, “’Ullo, Erb.  Going over a speech, eh, Erb?”
</p><p>No doubt at this period of Erb’s popularity.  His unselfish reticence in
the Willow Walk affair, the commonsense he exhibited in one or two minor
troubles, the increased polish of the spoken word: all these things
increased the men’s respect.  Also they knew that he worked for them day
and night: he had not developed the swollen head of importance that in
secretaries of other societies was nearly always a prominent feature.  He
organised a system of benefits on three scales, by which, if you paid in
twopence a week, you received fifteen shillings a week in the case of
unjust dismissal; twelve shillings a week for unjust suspension; and ten
shillings a week for strike pay.  He arranged with a pushful solicitor in
Camberwell to give legal advice.  He had written one or two articles
concerning the society in weekly penny papers, and in these he had taken
care not to obtrude his own name or his own work.  Even Spanswick
admitted now that Erb was turning out better than he had expected, but
Spanswick’s views might have been brightened by the fact that Erb was
organising a ticket benefit at the Surrey on Spanswick’s behalf: this not
so much on account of any personal misfortune, but because Mrs.
Spanswick, always a thoughtless, inconsiderate woman, had mistakenly
chosen a time when Spanswick was temporarily suspended from duty for
insobriety, to present him with twin babies.  “Three,” grumbled
Spanswick, “three, I could have understood.  There’d been a bit of money
about three.  But two—”  Spanswick’s friends had promised to rally round
him, a feat they performed in theory only, and Erb had to go elsewhere to
find buyers of the tickets.  Lady Frances had taken a box—a fact which
modified and chastened Spanswick’s very extreme views in regard to what
he usually called the slave-owning upper classes.  Lady Frances had done
a kinder thing than this.  On one of her visits to Bermondsey she had met
Louisa, white-faced and twitching as a result of her work, had gone to
Louisa’s employer, and had made him shake in his very shoes by denouncing
him and all his works, had demanded for Louisa a fortnight’s holiday,
which the employer, anxious enough to conciliate this emphatic young
titled person, and fearful of being sent to the Tower, at once conceded;
sent Louisa, with sister Alice for company, away to the country house at
Penshurst where the better side of Alice’s nature detached itself, and
she became an attentive nurse.  Erb’s Aunt Emma lived at Penshurst: the
old lady went up high in the estimation of the other villagers by reason
of her nieces’ visit to the Court.
</p><p>The month being July, work well in demand and overtime to be had without
asking, Erb was able to obtain consent to almost any project that he
liked to submit to his committee.  The society was new enough to feel the
enthusiasm of youth; the men were pleased with the sensation of power
that it gave to them, and they assumed there were no limits to its
possibilities.  From which causes Erb had several irons heating in the
fire, of which one was a new paper to be called “The Carman,” to be
issued twice a month, and to cost one halfpenny per copy.  The expense of
production would be something more than this, but when Erb, who was to be
managing editor, used that blessed word “propaganda,” there was nothing
more to be said, and the last doubter gave in.
</p><p>It was at this time that Erb gave up whistling in the streets.
</p>
<p>The white-haired labour member had taken him to the House on two
occasions, and in the smoking room had introduced him to some wealthy
members of the party; and, whilst the board at the side showed the names
of unattractive speakers, the members chatted so agreeably that Erb
forgot himself occasionally and addressed one who was in evening dress,
and had so much money that he wore several coins on his watch chain, as
“Sir;” lifting of eyebrows on the part of the labour member told him he
had blundered.  Members asked questions of Erb, questions which betrayed
the fact that their knowledge of the real feelings of the working men was
superficial, and thenceforth Erb felt more at his ease.  They gave their
names as patrons of the Spanswick benefit, and the member who wore coins
offered Erb a cigarette, and, seeing him through the outer lobby, begged
him to drop a line should anything important occur; this in a way that
suggested later to Erb, as he crossed Westminster, that the coin member
wanted to find opportunity of becoming attached to some creditable
grievance, not so much for the sake of the grievance as for the sake of
himself.
</p><p>“Now,” said Erb definitely to the fringe of lights near St. Thomas’s
Hospital, “I’m not going to be made a cat’s paw, mind you.”
</p><p>Interest came with the arrangements for Spanswick’s benefit.  This
necessitated calls at the theatre near the Obelisk in the evenings, and
speech with excited men who went about behind the scenes with their hats
at the backs of their heads: men who were for ever mislaying letters and
documents, and complaining of everybody else’s carelessness, and
eventually finding the letters or documents in their own hands; the while
on the stage some lady in black, with her face whitened, was bewailing to
a keenly interested house the perfidy of man, and assuring the gallery of
her determination to track down one particular individual, though he
should have made his way to the uttermost ends of the earth.  The
Spanswick night was to be a ticket benefit (which, being interpreted,
meant that only the tickets sold outside the theatre would add to
Spanswick’s income and assuage his present distress), and the night
selected was a Friday in the week booked by the “Sin’s Reward”
Company—Friday, because that was near to the men’s pay day, and would
hook them at the fleeting moment when spare cash was on the very point of
burning a hole in their pockets.  Because Lawrence Railton was of the
company, and because Erb was responsible for the success of the evening,
Rosalind communicated to the scheme the keen interest that became her so
well; her father, with ponderous generosity, had promised to ensure a
triumphant evening by giving what he termed the considerable advantage of
a somewhat long and not altogether undistinguished experience.  Erb was
anxious to see Lawrence Railton, desirous of seeing what manner of youth
had succeeded where he had desired to do so.  Matters being as they were,
there was no alternative but to play the friend of the family, to meet
Mr. Railton with the outstretched hand of amity, to congratulate him, and
to save up presently for a wedding present which should represent nicely
a genial interest in the welfare of the young couple.  A plated
cruet-stand he thought, as at present advised, but there were arguments
in favour of an inkstand that looked like a lawn-tennis set—an inkstand
had a suggestion of literary tastes that appealed to the prospective
editor of “The Carman;” it suggested also a compliment to Rosalind that a
cruet-stand with the best intentions could never convey.  He did not
quite know how he would endure it all.  Perhaps it would best be remedied
by increased application to the work of the society, and if ever the day
should come when he found himself elected to a seat in that House at
Westminster (the outside of which he went to see very often, just for
self-encouragement), Rosalind would feel that she might have done better
than marry Mr. Lawrence Railton.
</p><p>“But I don’t quite see,” admitted Erb, as he wrestled with all this, “I
don’t quite see what sort of help I shall get out of that.”
