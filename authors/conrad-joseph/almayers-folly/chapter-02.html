<p>When, in compliance with Lingard's abrupt demand, Almayer consented
to wed the Malay girl, no one knew that on the day when the interesting
young convert had lost all her natural relations and found a white
father, she had been fighting desperately like the rest of them
on board the prau, and was only prevented from leaping overboard,
like the few other survivors, by a severe wound in the leg.  There,
on the fore-deck of the prau, old Lingard found her under a heap
of dead and dying pirates, and had her carried on the poop of
the <em>Flash</em> before the Malay craft was set on fire and
sent adrift.  She was conscious, and in the great peace and stillness
of the tropical evening succeeding the turmoil of the battle,
she watched all she held dear on earth after her own savage manner,
drift away into the gloom in a great roar of flame and smoke. 
She lay there unheeding the careful hands attending to her wound,
silent and absorbed in gazing at the funeral pile of those brave
men she had so much admired and so well helped in their contest
with the redoubtable "Rajah-Laut."</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>The light night breeze fanned the brig gently to the southward,
and the great blaze of light got smaller and smaller till it twinkled
only on the horizon like a setting star.  It set: the heavy canopy
of smoke reflected the glare of hidden flames for a short time
and then disappeared also.</p>

<p>She realised that with this vanishing gleam her old life departed
too. Thenceforth there was slavery in the far countries, amongst
strangers, in unknown and perhaps terrible surroundings.  Being
fourteen years old, she realised her position and came to that
conclusion, the only one possible to a Malay girl, soon ripened
under a tropical sun, and not unaware of her personal charms,
of which she heard many a young brave warrior of her father's
crew express an appreciative admiration.  There was in her the
dread of the unknown; otherwise she accepted her position calmly,
after the manner of her people, and even considered it quite natural;
for was she not a daughter of warriors, conquered in battle, and
did she not belong rightfully to the victorious Rajah?  Even the
evident kindness of the terrible old man must spring, she thought,
from admiration for his captive, and the flattered vanity eased
for her the pangs of sorrow after such an awful calamity.  Perhaps
had she known of the high walls, the quiet gardens, and the silent
nuns of the Samarang convent, where her destiny was leading her,
she would have sought death in her dread and hate of such a restraint. 
But in imagination she pictured to herself the usual life of a
Malay girl&mdash;the usual succession of heavy work and fierce love,
of intrigues, gold ornaments, of domestic drudgery, and of that
great but occult influence which is one of the few rights of half-savage
womankind.  But her destiny in the rough hands of the old sea-dog,
acting under unreasoning impulses of the heart, took a strange
and to her a terrible shape.  She bore it all&mdash;the restraint and
the teaching and the new faith&mdash;with calm submission, concealing
her hate and contempt for all that new life.  She learned the
language very easily, yet understood but little of the new faith
the good sisters taught her, assimilating quickly only the superstitious
elements of the religion.  She called Lingard father, gently and
caressingly, at each of his short and noisy visits, under the
clear impression that he was a great and dangerous power it was
good to propitiate.  Was he not now her master?  And during those
long four years she nourished a hope of finding favour in his
eyes and ultimately becoming his wife, counsellor, and guide.</p>

<p>Those dreams of the future were dispelled by the Rajah Laut's
"fiat," which made Almayer's fortune, as that young man fondly
hoped.  And dressed in the hateful finery of Europe, the centre
of an interested circle of Batavian society, the young convert
stood before the altar with an unknown and sulky-looking white
man.  For Almayer was uneasy, a little disgusted, and greatly
inclined to run away.  A judicious fear of the adopted father-in-law
and a just regard for his own material welfare prevented him from
making a scandal; yet, while swearing fidelity, he was concocting
plans for getting rid of the pretty Malay girl in a more or less
distant future.  She, however, had retained enough of conventual
teaching to understand well that according to white men's laws
she was going to be Almayer's companion and not his slave, and
promised to herself to act accordingly.</p>

<p>So when the <em>Flash</em> freighted with materials for building
a new house left the harbour of Batavia, taking away the young
couple into the unknown Borneo, she did not carry on her deck
so much love and happiness as old Lingard was wont to boast of
before his casual friends in the verandahs of various hotels. 
The old seaman himself was perfectly happy. Now he had done his
duty by the girl.  "You know I made her an orphan," he often concluded
solemnly, when talking about his own affairs to a scratch audience
of shore loafers&mdash;as it was his habit to do.  And the approbative
shouts of his half-intoxicated auditors filled his simple soul
with delight and pride.  "I carry everything right through," was
another of his sayings, and in pursuance of that principle he
pushed the building of house and godowns on the Pantai River with
feverish haste. The house for the young couple; the godowns for
the big trade Almayer was going to develop while he (Lingard)
would be able to give himself up to some mysterious work which
was only spoken of in hints, but was understood to relate to gold
and diamonds in the interior of the island. Almayer was impatient
too.  Had he known what was before him he might not have been
so eager and full of hope as he stood watching the last canoe
of the Lingard expedition disappear in the bend up the river. 
When, turning round, he beheld the pretty little house, the big
godowns built neatly by an army of Chinese carpenters, the new
jetty round which were clustered the trading canoes, he felt a
sudden elation in the thought that the world was his.</p>

<p>But the world had to be conquered first, and its conquest was
not so easy as he thought.  He was very soon made to understand
that he was not wanted in that corner of it where old Lingard
and his own weak will placed him, in the midst of unscrupulous
intrigues and of a fierce trade competition.  The Arabs had found
out the river, had established a trading post in Sambir, and where
they traded they would be masters and suffer no rival.  Lingard
returned unsuccessful from his first expedition, and departed
again spending all the profits of the legitimate trade on his
mysterious journeys.  Almayer struggled with the difficulties
of his position, friendless and unaided, save for the protection
given to him for Lingard's sake by the old Rajah, the predecessor
of Lakamba.  Lakamba himself, then living as a private individual
on a rice clearing, seven miles down the river, exercised all
his influence towards the help of the white man's enemies, plotting
against the old Rajah and Almayer with a certainty of combination,
pointing clearly to a profound knowledge of their most secret
affairs. Outwardly friendly, his portly form was often to be seen
on Almayer's verandah; his green turban and gold-embroidered jacket
shone in the front rank of the decorous throng of Malays coming
to greet Lingard on his returns from the interior; his salaams
were of the lowest, and his handshakings of the heartiest, when
welcoming the old trader.  But his small eyes took in the signs
of the times, and he departed from those interviews with a satisfied
and furtive smile to hold long consultations with his friend and
ally, Syed Abdulla, the chief of the Arab trading post, a man
of great wealth and of great influence in the islands.</p>

<p>It was currently believed at that time in the settlement that
Lakamba's visits to Almayer's house were not limited to those
official interviews. Often on moonlight nights the belated fishermen
of Sambira saw a small canoe shooting out from the narrow creek
at the back of the white man's house, and the solitary occupant
paddle cautiously down the river in the deep shadows of the bank;
and those events, duly reported, were discussed round the evening
fires far into the night with the cynicism of expression common
to aristocratic Malays, and with a malicious pleasure in the domestic
misfortunes of the Orang Blando&mdash;the hated Dutchman. Almayer went
on struggling desperately, but with a feebleness of purpose depriving
him of all chance of success against men so unscrupulous and resolute
as his rivals the Arabs.  The trade fell away from the large godowns,
and the godowns themselves rotted piecemeal.  The old man's banker,
Hudig of Macassar, failed, and with this went the whole available
capital.  The profits of past years had been swallowed up in Lingard's
exploring craze.  Lingard was in the interior&mdash;perhaps dead&mdash;at
all events giving no sign of life.  Almayer stood alone in the
midst of those adverse circumstances, deriving only a little comfort
from the companionship of his little daughter, born two years
after the marriage, and at the time some six years old.  His wife
had soon commenced to treat him with a savage contempt expressed
by sulky silence, only occasionally varied by a flood of savage
invective.  He felt she hated him, and saw her jealous eyes watching
himself and the child with almost an expression of hate.  She
was jealous of the little girl's evident preference for the father,
and Almayer felt he was not safe with that woman in the house.
While she was burning the furniture, and tearing down the pretty
curtains in her unreasoning hate of those signs of civilisation,
Almayer, cowed by these outbursts of savage nature, meditated
in silence on the best way of getting rid of her.  He thought
of everything; even planned murder in an undecided and feeble
sort of way, but dared do nothing&mdash;expecting every day the return
of Lingard with news of some immense good fortune.  He returned
indeed, but aged, ill, a ghost of his former self, with the fire
of fever burning in his sunken eyes, almost the only survivor
of the numerous expedition.  But he was successful at last!  Untold
riches were in his grasp; he wanted more money&mdash;only a little
more torealise a dream of fabulous fortune.  And Hudig had failed! 
Almayer scraped all he could together, but the old man wanted
more.  If Almayer could not get it he would go to Singapore&mdash;to
Europe even, but before all to Singapore; and he would take the
little Nina with him.  The child must be brought up decently. 
He had good friends in Singapore who would take care of her and
have her taught properly.  All would be well, and that girl, upon
whom the old seaman seemed to have transferred all his former
affection for the mother, would be the richest woman in the East&mdash;in
the world even.  So old Lingard shouted, pacing the verandah with
his heavy quarterdeck step, gesticulating with a smouldering cheroot;
ragged, dishevelled, enthusiastic; and Almayer, sitting huddled
up on a pile of mats, thought with dread of the separation with
the only human being he loved&mdash;with greater dread still, perhaps,
of the scene with his wife, the savage tigress deprived of her
young.  She will poison me, thought the poor wretch, well aware
of that easy and final manner of solving the social, political,
or family problems in Malay life.</p>

<p>To his great surprise she took the news very quietly, giving
only him and Lingard a furtive glance, and saying not a word. 
This, however, did not prevent her the next day from jumping into
the river and swimming after the boat in which Lingard was carrying
away the nurse with the screaming child.  Almayer had to give
chase with his whale-boat and drag her in by the hair in the midst
of cries and curses enough to make heaven fall.  Yet after two
days spent in wailing, she returned to her former mode of life,
chewing betel-nut, and sitting all day amongst her women in stupefied
idleness.  She aged very rapidly after that, and only roused herself
from her apathy to acknowledge by a scathing remark or an insulting
exclamation the accidental presence of her husband.  He had built
for her a riverside hut in the compound where she dwelt in perfect
seclusion. Lakamba's visits had ceased when, by a convenient decree
of Providence and the help of a little scientific manipulation,
the old ruler of Sambir departed this life.  Lakamba reigned in
his stead now, having been well served by his Arab friends with
the Dutch authorities.  Syed Abdulla was the great man and trader
of the Pantai.  Almayer lay ruined and helpless under the close-meshed
net of their intrigues, owing his life only to his supposed knowledge
of Lingard's valuable secret.  Lingard had disappeared.  He wrote
once from Singapore saying the child was well, and under the care
of a Mrs. Vinck, and that he himself was going to Europe to raise
money for the great enterprise.  "He was coming back soon.  There
would be no difficulties," he wrote; "people would rush in with
their money."  Evidently they did not, for there was only one
letter more from him saying he was ill, had found no relation
living, but little else besides.  Then came a complete silence. 
Europe had swallowed up the Rajah Laut apparently, and Almayer
looked vainly westward for a ray of light out of the gloom of
his shattered hopes.  Years passed, and the rare letters from
Mrs. Vinck, later on from the girl herself, were the only thing
to be looked to to make life bearable amongst the triumphant savagery
of the river.  Almayer lived now alone, having even ceased to
visit his debtors who would not pay, sure of Lakamba's protection. 
The faithful Sumatrese Ali cooked his rice and made his coffee,
for he dared not trust any one else, and least of all his wife. 
He killed time wandering sadly in the overgrown paths round the
house, visiting the ruined godowns where a few brass guns covered
with verdigris and only a few broken cases of mouldering Manchester
goods reminded him of the good early times when all this was full
of life and merchandise, and he overlooked a busy scene on the
river bank, his little daughter by his side.  Now the up-country
canoes glided past the little rotten wharf of Lingard and Co.,
to paddle up the Pantai branch, and cluster round the new jetty
belonging to Abdulla.  Not that they loved Abdulla, but they dared
not trade with the man whose star had set.  Had they done so they
knew there was no mercy to be expected from Arab or Rajah; no
rice to be got on credit in the times of scarcity from either;
and Almayer could not help them, having at times hardly enough
for himself.  Almayer, in his isolation and despair, often envied
his near neighbour the Chinaman, JimEng, whom he could see stretched
on a pile of cool mats, a wooden pillow under his head, an opium
pipe in his nerveless fingers.  He did not seek, however, consolation
in opium&mdash;perhaps it was too expensive&mdash;perhaps his white man's
pride saved him from that degradation; but most likely it was
the thought of his little daughter in the far-off Straits Settlements. 
He heard from her oftener since Abdulla bought a steamer, which
ran now between Singapore and the Pantai settlement every three
months or so. Almayer felt himself nearer his daughter.  He longed
to see her, and planned a voyage to Singapore, but put off his
departure from year to year, always expecting some favourable
turn of fortune.  He did not want to meet her with empty hands
and with no words of hope on his lips.  He could not take her
back into that savage life to which he was condemned himself. 
He was also a little afraid of her.  What would she think of him? 
He reckoned the years.  A grown woman.  A civilised woman, young
and hopeful; while he felt old and hopeless, and very much like
those savages round him.  He asked himself what was going to be
her future.  He could not answer that question yet, and he dared
not face her.  And yet he longed after her.  He hesitated for
years.</p>

<p>His hesitation was put an end to by Nina's unexpected appearance
in Sambir.  She arrived in the steamer under the captain's care. 
Almayer beheld her with surprise not unmixed with wonder.  During
those ten years the child had changed into a woman, black-haired,
olive-skinned, tall, and beautiful, with great sad eyes, where
the startled expression common to Malay womankind was modified
by a thoughtful tinge inherited from her European ancestry.  Almayer
thought with dismay of the meeting of his wife and daughter, of
what this grave girl in European clothes would think of her betel-nut
chewing mother, squatting in a dark hut, disorderly, half naked,
and sulky.  He also feared an outbreak of temper on the part of
that pest of a woman he had hitherto managed to keep tolerably
quiet, thereby saving the remnants of his dilapidated furniture. 
And he stood there before the closed door of the hut in the blazing
sunshine listening to the murmur of voices, wondering what went
on inside, wherefrom all the servant-maids had been expelled at
the beginning of the interview, and now stood clustered by the
palings with half-covered faces in a chatter of curious speculation. 
He forgot himself there trying to catch a stray word through the
bamboo walls, till the captain of the steamer, who had walked
up with the girl, fearing a sunstroke, took him under the arm
and led him into the shade of his own verandah: where Nina's trunk
stood already, having been landed by the steamer's men.  As soon
as Captain Ford had his glass before him and his cheroot lighted,
Almayer asked for the explanation of his daughter's unexpected
arrival.  Ford said little beyond generalising in vague but violent
terms upon the foolishness of women in general, and of Mrs. Vinck
in particular.</p>

<p>"You know, Kaspar," said he, in conclusion, to the excited Almayer,
"it is deucedly awkward to have a half-caste girl in the house. 
There's such a lot of fools about.  There was that young fellow
from the bank who used to ride to the Vinck bungalow early and
late.  That old woman thought it was for that Emma of hers.  When
she found out what he wanted exactly, there was a row, I can tell
you.  She would not have Nina&mdash;not an hour longer&mdash;in the house. 
Fact is, I heard of this affair and took the girl to my wife. 
My wife is a pretty good woman&mdash;as women go&mdash;and upon my word
we would have kept the girl for you, only she would not stay. 
Now, then!  Don't flare up, Kaspar.  Sit still.  What can you
do?  It is better so.  Let her stay with you.  She was never happy
over there.  Those two Vinck girls are no better than dressed-up
monkeys.  They slighted her.  You can't make her white.  It's
no use you swearing at me.  You can't.  She is a good girl for
all that, but she would not tell my wife anything.  If you want
to know, ask her yourself; but if I was you I would leave her
alone.  You are welcome to her passage money, old fellow, if you
are short now."  And the skipper, throwing away his cigar, walked
off to "wake them up on board," as he expressed it.</p>

<p>Almayer vainly expected to hear of the cause of his daughter's
return from his daughter's lips.  Not that day, not on any other
day did she ever allude to her Singapore life.  He did not care
to ask, awed by the calm impassiveness of her face, by those solemn
eyes looking past him on the great, still forests sleeping in
majestic repose to the murmur of the broad river.  He accepted
the situation, happy in the gentle and protecting affection the
girl showed him, fitfully enough, for she had, as she called it,
her bad days when she used to visit her mother and remain long
hours in the riverside hut, coming out as inscrutable as ever,
but with a contemptuous look and a short word ready to answer
any of his speeches.  He got used even to that, and on those days
kept quiet, although greatly alarmed by his wife's influence upon
the girl.  Otherwise Nina adapted herself wonderfully to the circumstances
of a half-savage and miserable life.  She accepted without question
or apparent disgust the neglect, the decay, the poverty of the
household, the absence of furniture, and the preponderance of
rice diet on the family table.  She lived with Almayer in the
little house (now sadly decaying) built originally by Lingard
for the young couple.  The Malays eagerly discussed her arrival. 
There were at the beginning crowded levees of Malay women with
their children, seeking eagerly after "Ubat" for all the ills
of the flesh from the young Mem Putih.  In the cool of the evening
grave Arabs in long white shirts and yellow sleeveless jackets
walked slowly on the dusty path by the riverside towards Almayer's
gate, and made solemn calls upon that Unbeliever under shallow
pretences of business, only to get a glimpse of the young girl
in a highly decorous manner.  Even Lakamba came out of his stockade
in a great pomp of war canoes and red umbrellas, and landed on
the rotten little jetty of Lingard and Co.  He came, he said,
to buy a couple of brass guns as a present to his friend the chief
of Sambir Dyaks; and while Almayer, suspicious but polite, busied
himself in unearthing the old popguns in the godowns, the Rajah
sat on an armchair in the verandah, surrounded by his respectful
retinue waiting in vain for Nina's appearance.  She was in one
of her bad days, and remained in her mother's hut watching with
her the ceremonious proceedings on the verandah.  The Rajah departed,
baffled but courteous, and soon Almayer began to reap the benefit
of improved relations with the ruler in the shape of the recovery
of some debts, paid to him with many apologies and many a low
salaam by debtors till then considered hopelessly insolvent. Under
these improving circumstances Almayer brightened up a little. 
All was not lost perhaps.  Those Arabs and Malays saw at last
that he was a man of some ability, he thought.  And he began,
after his manner, to plan great things, to dream of great fortunes
for himself and Nina.  Especially for Nina!  Under these vivifying
impulses he asked Captain Ford to write to his friends in England
making inquiries after Lingard.  Was he alive or dead?  If dead,
had he left any papers, documents; any indications or hints as
to his great enterprise?  Meantime he had found amongst the rubbish
in one of the empty rooms a note-book belonging to the old adventurer. 
He studied the crabbed handwriting of its pages and often grew
meditative over it.  Other things also woke him up from his apathy.
The stir made in the whole of the island by the establishment
of the British Borneo Company affected even the sluggish flow
of the Pantai life.  Great changes were expected; annexation was
talked of; the Arabs grew civil.  Almayer began building his new
house for the use of the future engineers, agents, or settlers
of the new Company.  He spent every available guilder on it with
a confiding heart.  One thing only disturbed his happiness: his
wife came out of her seclusion, importing her green jacket, scant
sarongs, shrill voice, and witch-like appearance, into his quiet
life in the small bungalow.  And his daughter seemed to accept
that savage intrusion into their daily existence with wonderful
equanimity.  He did not like it, but dared say nothing.</p>
