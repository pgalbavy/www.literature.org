<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The first two weeks of September spent in torrid New York were a strange
period of time to have projected itself into the calm life of Miss
Patricia Adair of Adairville, Kentucky. Suddenly she found herself a cog
screwed tight into a rapid-fire piece of machinery that was running at
top speed night and day, by name, "The Purple Slipper."
</p>
<p>For long hours she sat in the coolness of that stage-box and held her
breath while she threw her whole self into the building of the play,
which so fascinatingly was and was not hers. And through all those
hours, close at her side, between her and the big dim theater, sat Mr.
Godfrey Vandeford, with his arm across the back of her chair and his
eager face close to hers and tilted at the same angle. Her slightest
murmur or his lowest whisper caught and was answered, and they almost
seemed to be breathing one breath, so absorbed were they in the destiny
of their mutual adventure. Like all women of her kind, Patricia Adair
had known men only through a cloud, which sex traditions had firmly held
between her and them, and Godfrey Vandeford was the first man she had
encountered since she had slipped outside of its deadening density into
a world where men and women endeavored together first, and left their
sentinel undertakings to a fitting secondary time and place. In all
sincerity she accepted him as a co-worker and was as happy working with
him as it was possible for a woman to be. She specially liked being
beside him in the office, and watched him settle the details of the
running the big machine smoothly, from the hiring of the property-man to
the firing of three successive stage-carpenters.
</p><p>"Real eats, Mr. Vandeford?" the former had inquired one morning.
</p><p>"Brown-bread turkey, nice and tasty, good crackers, but soda-pop and so
forth for booze. Remember, they've got to face it, we hope, many weeks;
don't turn their stomachs so they'll all gag."
</p><p>"I see, sir, I see. I fed 'Maple Leaves' for two years, and they all et
every night and gimme a purse when it closed to go to London."
</p><p>"Goes!"
</p><p>"Brown-bread turkey sounds nice. I'm hungry," said Miss Adair, as the
good-providing property-man departed.
</p><p>"Pop is going to bring us a piece of pie and a bottle of milk from the
automat," answered Mr. Vandeford, as he began putting busy stabs with
the press pencil on a pile of papers. "I ought to send him to get Denny
to motor you for a real feed in the cool somewhere, but I want you
here." With perfect unconcern, he went on checking the list the
property-man had left him. He had ceased trying to decide the meaning of
the flutter which he was not sure Miss Adair really gave when she was
pleased. He was too busy to think about anything but the rush and roar
of the machinery of "The Purple Slipper," so he just kept Miss Adair so
near him for all the waking hours of the day that he could have no
occasion to have his thoughts distracted by worrying over just what
might be befalling her. Day after day he extracted her from the Y. W. C.
A. at ten o'clock A. M., fed her and Miss Lindsey coffee and rolls and
berries just any place that they happened to see (often he even ate with
the two girls in the big empty cafeteria at the institution), lunched
with her in the same haphazard fashion, sought a cool and quiet spot to
give her dinner, and a ride on a country road, turned her into the big
safety at about eleven o'clock, and went to bed to sleep the sleep of
the interestedly absorbed.
</p><p>The few evenings that Miss Adair spent with Mr. Gerald Height Mr.
Vandeford did not find repose so early or with such ease. Also, his
awakening on those mornings after was not so joyous, and he arrived at
the Y. W. C. A. fifteen and twenty minutes too early upon each occasion.
</p><p>However, his time was well spent in chatting with the brisk young
secretary, and his anxiety was entirely relieved each time by finding
the look intact in the gray eyes raised to his in eager greeting after
the prolonged absence of fourteen hours, when the usual separation was
about ten.
</p><p>"We went out to a place called the Beach Inn last night, and whom do you
suppose we saw there?" she demanded on one of the mornings after, over
her bowl of halved peaches.
</p><p>"Mr. and Mrs. Devil?" he asked, with a sparkle breaking through the
frown with which he had instantly greeted her mention of that gay beach
resort.
</p><p>"No; Miss Hawtry and Mr. Farraday. She wasn't nice to us at all, but Mr.
Height says she always treats him badly when they are rehearsing
together. I think Mr. Height is perfectly wonderful to her on the
stage. He's so gentle and kind; but then he's that in real life, isn't
he?"
</p><p>"Is he?" growled Mr. Vandeford over his corn-flakes.
</p><p>"Yes, and he's so just and fine in the way he speaks about everybody. He
told me how poor Miss Hawtry used to be and how you pushed her along
until she could buy that lovely house we passed, in which the Trevors
are staying while she is in town. It is hard on you, too, not to be out
there boarding with them and her instead of in this heat."
</p><p>"Did Height say that I--I boarded--out there?" demanded Mr. Vandeford,
pushing his coffee-cup away from him with a sudden snap.
</p><p>"Yes, he said you stayed out there in the summer always, and--"
</p><p>"We're late," interrupted Mr. Vandeford, snapping his watch with the
same temper he had used on his coffee-cup. "Bring that saucer of peaches
along and eat it in the car."
</p><p>"I'll take an orange instead," assented Miss Adair, as with all
good-nature and in all naturalness she deserted the last half of the
rosy peach, took an orange from the bowl before her and stood up to go
out to the car, which Valentine had parked in the shadow of the building
opposite.
</p><p>"You kid, you!" scoffed Mr. Vandeford, with an ache in his heart, but
thanksgiving for that same youthful unsophistication. "Height or
somebody will get it all across to her, and then what'll I do?" he
growled to himself as he followed her into the car.
</p><p>"And I saw that Mazie--Mazie woman there, too, with a terrible-looking
man that has written ever so many plays that are successful." Mr.
Vandeford was devoutly thankful that Mr. Grant Howard's name had not
stuck in the consciousness of the author of "The Purple Slipper." "I--I
was introduced to them too--because you know you said that I must--must
accept broad standards, and I did--last night." Miss Adair looked away,
but Mr. Vandeford could see that her little ears, set close against her
small head, with their tips covered by a smooth band of hair, grew rosy.
</p><p>"What?" he gasped, uncertain as to what she meant.
</p><p>"Talked to that--that playwright and--and drank some champagne. I like
cider better, but Mr. Height ordered it, and I thought--"
</p><p>Here the car stopped, and Valentine was at the door. Valentine never
failed to be at the door instantly when Miss Adair was in Mr.
Vandeford's car, because his French soul rejoiced within him for thus
serving a grand dame.
</p><p>"Rooney is on the last lap of the last act, and then he'll begin to
polish the whole for dress rehearsals," Mr. Vandeford said as he held
the curtains of their box aside for her to enter.
</p><p>"And Mr. Height told me, too, that the Trevors had--"
</p><p>"Hush!" commanded Mr. Vandeford, becoming the stern producer, because he
felt that he could stand no more of Mr. Height at the Beach Inn, though
he began to listen intently to that same gentleman and Bébé Herne in the
beginning of the great scene of the now authorless play. The anxieties
passed from him, and in a moment he was in harness again with his author
and running in perfect unison.
</p><p>"Cut it off, Height, cut it off!" commanded Mr. Rooney, and he ran his
hands into his shock of black hair, which stood up all over his head
like a black, sooty mop. "That scene needs something. It isn't big and
simple enough. What did she say to him in your first layout, miss?" he
demanded of Miss Adair, for the first time acknowledging to the company
the presence of the author of their play at the rehearsals. "Can you
remember?"
</p><p>"Yes," answered Miss Adair, with the home-made color blazing in her
cheeks and fires in her gray eyes as she rose in the box, and gave the
six lines as she had written them. Her lovely, slurring, Blue-grass
voice made the whole company smile with pleasure.
</p><p>"That's it! That's it! That's real people jawing and not a lot of smarty
guff. Put that in, Fido, and write it in, Miss Herne," commanded Mr.
Rooney, without any form of thanks to the accommodating and forgiving
author.
</p><p>And truth to say the author of "The Purple Slipper" did not notice his
omission. She was in such joy at having something of the "big scene"
express what she had intended that she was clasping one of Mr.
Vandeford's hands in both hers and holding on tight to keep from
shedding tears of joy.
</p><p>"What did I tell you?" he asked, taking the two nervously clutched
little hands into his warm, strong ones, unseen in the shadow of the
box. "You keep getting things across to Bill by letting him ask you for
what he wants. See?"
</p><p>"Yes, and I'm always glad when I do as you tell me," she whispered, with
her lips almost against his ear as they both turned back to the stage
and watched their machine begin to run on greased wheels. Mr. Vandeford
thought of the Beach Inn, Mazie, the bottle of champagne, and Mr. Gerald
Height, and groaned inwardly.
</p><p>The last week of the rehearsals of "The Purple Slipper" was a hectic
rush, the like of which Miss Adair had never imagined. She had gone out
again for the week-end to Mrs. Farraday's, up in Westchester, and this
time Mr. Vandeford drove out on Sunday for tea and crape myrtle with Mr.
Dennis Farraday, and, he was surprised to note again, Miss Mildred
Lindsey. The day passed like an oasis in the midst of a desert storm,
and Mr. Vandeford had the pleasure of making all arrangements for Mrs.
Farraday, Mr. and Mrs. Van Tyne, and several other old Manhattaners, who
had fallen under the spell of the young Kentuckian who had in an off
moment perpetrated "The Purple Slipper," to go to Atlantic City the
following week to be upon the spot for the opening of the play. Suites
in the great new hotel were engaged by long-distance telephone,
time-tables discussed, and trains settled upon by the time tea was over
and the golden sun had let the twilight purple the rosy plumes of the
huge myrtle hedges. In the dusk Valentine brought Mr. Vandeford's car
from the garage and Mrs. Farraday's chauffeur drove out Mr. Dennis
Farraday's beloved Surreness. Miss Lindsey said her farewell, and it
again surprised Mr. Vandeford to see the gracious kiss Mrs. Farraday put
upon the dusky red of the beautiful Western girl's cheek, while good
Dennis stood smilingly by in the friendliest delight. Then a wistful
sigh from the talented young author by his side claimed his instant
attention.
</p><p>"What is it?" he asked, with no attempt to control the tenderness in his
voice, though the dusk hid that in his eyes.
</p><p>"I want to go back to town with you," she answered him, with a little
catch in her voice. "I feel so far away from you and--and IT, up here."
</p><p>"You shall," he answered, and turned toward Mrs. Farraday, who was
coming across the grass towards them with a huge sheaf of myrtles for
his car flower-baskets in her arms. "I wonder if you'll let me take my
author back to town in a hurry to-night, Mater Farraday," he pleaded,
with the affectionate smile in both his voice and eyes that he had
learned to use in coaxing her since the days ten years ago when she had
begun to mother him along with big Dennis. "I--I sorter--sorter need
her."
</p><p>Mrs. Farraday looked at them both with a keenness under the affection in
her glance, and then laughed merrily.
</p><p>"Yes, go with him, Patricia," she commanded. "I have lived through the
week before the presentation of five plays for Van, and I think that it
is only just that you should share that ordeal with me. He's impossible,
and demands--everything. I gave him a perfectly new and wonderful hat
that cost a hundred and ten dollars for the second scene of 'Dear
Geraldine' right off my head at the dress rehearsal, and 'Miss Cut-up'
did her dances on one of my most choice Chinese rugs. Now he's taking
you from me. But go!"
</p><p>"Here's your wrap, still in the car, so hop in," commanded Mr. Vandeford
hurriedly, as though he feared that Mrs. Farraday would withdraw her
sympathetic permission. "Good-night, and thank you!"
</p><p>"Good-night, you two--two dear children," returned Mrs. Farraday, as she
saw them off, after tenderly embracing Miss Adair and making plans for
their future meeting. "How <u>lovely</u> it would be!" she murmured to
herself, with a lack of definition, as she went back to the stately
house behind the tree, where windows were beginning to glow.
</p><p>For a long time the producer and his author were silent.
</p><p>"I hate it--and I love it," Miss Adair finally said, with her soft,
slurring voice lowered almost to a whisper as Valentine sped them along
the country road perfumed and dusky with the early night, though a
silvery radiance proclaimed a chaperoning moon as imminent.
</p><p>"That is the proper way for an author to feel about a play one week
before the opening," Mr. Vandeford assured her, with a laugh keyed to
match her declaration. "It shows an entire sympathy with the poor
producer."
</p><p>"Suppose, just suppose, that the producer had been anybody but you and I
had had to stand all--" Words failed Miss Adair in imaging her plight as
author to another producer than Mr. Vandeford.
</p><p>"Any other producer might have done better than I have done for you,"
Mr. Vandeford answered her, with a sadness in his voice that he himself
had never heard before. And as he spoke he resolved to tell her the
whole Hawtry situation, which was haunting him day and night; to begin
with the purple, letter-manuscript hunch, which he had lightly taken up
to spank Miss Hawtry for trying to double-cross him with Weiner about
"The Rosie Posie Girl," and end up with the hopeless state of his
feelings about herself. Miss Adair herself stemmed the confession which
might have altered the fate of that good machine "The Purple Slipper."
</p><p>"You've made the whole horrible experience worth while to me, and I'm
going to be a great playwright yet, just to make you--you proud of me,"
she assured his sadness in the purple dusk, and this time Mr. Vandeford
was so sure of the flutter that he reached out his hand and captured a
part of it, a white, slim little hand that nestled into his as though it
were not in any way aware of doing so. "I'm going to dinner with Miss
Herne to-morrow night, so Mr. Kent can show me what is the matter with
part of his costume for the third act, and then I'm going to coax Mr.
Corbett to fix it over for him," she continued, speaking of the business
of learning to be the great playwright she had promised him to become.
</p><p>"Er--er, did you say dinner with Bébé and--and Kent?" Mr. Vandeford
stammered as a desperate opening for letting his author know just what
she was doing in visiting that establishment without-the-law.
</p><p>"Yes, I know about them; Mildred told me, but I told her that I was
going to accept the 'broad standard' that prevailed in my profession. I
like both of those people a lot. What business is it of mine if they
don't want to get married?" Miss Adair's voice was coolly unconcerned
and professional.
</p><p>"Help!" ejaculated Mr. Vandeford, holding the slim little hand as if
drowning. And indeed he did have a sinking sensation, which, strange to
say, was relieved by a quick mental vision of the capable young woman at
the desk of the great international safety.
</p><p>"And I know about Mr. Height's three divorces, and I think he is to be
pitied instead of criticized for being so unfortunate and lonely.
Mildred says she doesn't believe he is as lonely as he tells me he is,
but I know he is. I asked Miss Herne to ask him to dinner, too, and she
did," Miss Adair continued, thus making little stabs into Mr.
Vandeford's vitals.
</p><p>And right there Mr. Vandeford paid the entire penalty for all his tilts
against organized morality by feeling unworthy to take a beautiful,
fragrant, adoring, confiding girl in his arms and telling her all he had
learned of the tragic results of such tilts. His predicament was tragic,
though unique. If he summed up these others, he sized up himself to her,
and by what judgment he taught her to judge them she would judge him
when the time came. If he taught her to turn from Kent or Height she
would turn from him, when she knew him entirely, as she surely would
soon. And, forsooth, how would he prove to her that he was a better man
than the copper-headed tango lizard, Height, though he knew himself to
be? And who was this girl, anyway, to come out of a little back-woods
town where the standards of life were so narrow that all who could lived
out of them in degrading secrecy, and make him feel himself unworthy
when he had lived openly in a way about which his own conscience had not
troubled him? Why did he hesitate to tell her about his affair with the
Violet and his anxiety about her contract, and why should his face burn
at the thought of telling her how he had coolly let his best friend in
for the prospect of an affair with the star for the purpose of
protecting her and her play? And why should the sex and business
standards of his world be entirely different from those of hers or any
other world! On the other hand why shouldn't they all double-cross and
prey on and defame and applaud each other to their heart's content? Why
should they care if they were judged by--? At this part Mr. Vandeford's
bitter reflections were suddenly invaded by a perceptible collapse of
Miss Adair's soft and proud young body against his, and a round, warm
cheek fell against his silk-clad sleeve, as he perceived that his
eminent author had plunged suddenly into the depths of healthy and
innocent slumber, while he had been moralizing about her and the rest
of the universe. He slipped his arm about her with cautious tenderness
and made her comfortable, while he muttered to himself:
</p><p>"She's a white flame and, God willing, I'm going to keep her that!"
</p><p>During the next week the "white flame" burned high and bright while the
author of "The Purple Slipper" threw herself into her place in the
grinding of the machine that was to turn out a perfected play on the
following Tuesday night at Atlantic City. Everywhere Mr. Rooney was
tightening bolts and polishing surfaces until they glistened while he
snapped and tried out all bands.
</p><p>Miss Lindsey was pale and quiet, but she acted her part to Mr. Rooney's
entire satisfaction, though he never said so. Mr. Leigh's feet were
still a target, and the glowering girl, Miss Grayson, was always
tearful, but constantly improving. When the company was not being ground
and polished, Mr. Corbett's tailors and dressmakers were fitting
costumes, and the property man was checking over and over each demand of
each and every person, from the fresh rose Mr. Kent was to give to Dame
Carrington to the mud that was to be splashed every day upon Mr. Gerald
Height's riding-boots for his last and triumphant entry. Miss Adair had
lost all sense of the play as a whole and only thought of it as
distracting and distracted bits. She had, of course, never witnessed the
scenes between Miss Hawtry and Mr. Height, as they were still rehearsed
in private and would be until the night of the dress rehearsal on Monday
at Atlantic City. This was well.
</p><p>But one thing she kept with her through the whole strain; the sense of
being one with Mr. Godfrey Vandeford and that one working for pure joy.
</p><p>As for Mr. Vandeford, his eyes sank back under his brows, and Mr. Adolph
Meyers was with him far into every night.
</p><p>"How does the booking stand now, Pops?" Mr. Vandeford demanded on the
Thursday night before the opening Tuesday.
</p><p>"Atlantic City next week, Wilmington and New Haven the next if need be,
and--it is to Syracuse or Toronto we must jump, Mr. Vandeford, sir,"
answered Mr. Meyers, with beads of perspiration on his high brow.
</p><p>"Violet will never make that jump, Pops. Her contract closes the day we
open in Atlantic City, and there we'll close, too, if we haven't New
York right in sight. What'll we do?"
</p><p>"It is many a show closed before it opened," Mr. Meyers said, with a
wary look at Mr. Vandeford.
</p><p>"This show is going to open and never close--until it's had a thorough
Broadway try-out, Pops," said Mr. Vandeford, quietly. "Anything from Mr.
Breit?"
</p><p>"Nothing to hope for a Broadway opening before November first."
</p><p>"I'll pass the question up Friday, and then see what I'll do," Mr.
Vandeford said slowly as if turning his back for the moment to
something that stared him in the face.
</p><p>All Friday morning he worked with "The Purple Slipper" machine with a
bitter defiance in his eyes that made Miss Adair keep close to his side,
though she didn't understand her reason for doing so.
</p><p>"Is anything the matter?" she questioned, with her gray eyes stricken
with alarm. The fear for her play in those gray eyes sent Mr. Vandeford
into desperate measures. He asked Miss Hawtry to go to luncheon with
him, and she graciously accepted.
</p><p>"Where do we get in on Broadway after Atlantic City, Van?" she asked as
soon as she was served with her iced melon.
</p><p>"We get in all right," he parried, putting his spoon into his
cantaloupe.
</p><p>"That's fine. I don't mind that Atlantic City week, but I'm glad I'm
past ever doing the road again except to the Coast. They'll eat up 'The
Rosie Posie Girl' in Chicago and San Francisco." Miss Hawtry was
deliberately declaring her intentions to Mr. Vandeford without saying a
word about them.
</p><p>"I'm going to take 'The Purple Slipper' over to London before I take it
West." Mr. Vandeford answered her declaration with another not put in
words, but so well did he know the workings of her shrewd, small mind
that he saw that the game was up unless he did what he must do. During
the rest of their luncheon they talked about the Trevors.
</p><p>Straight from the Astor Mr. Vandeford walked into the office of Mr.
Weiner.
</p><p>"Weiner," he asked, without any sort of preamble, "will you give a
month's try-out of my play, 'The Purple Slipper,' in your New Carnival
Theater from October first to November first, with a proper guarantee,
and then an option on an unlimited run there if it makes good, for a
half-interest in 'The Rosie Posie Girl' <u>without</u> Hawtry?" Mr. Vandeford
knew that he was offering Mr. Weiner a good thing, for the rights of
"The Rosie Posie Girl" had been hotly contested by all the big
theatrical managers on Broadway the winter before, and Mr. Vandeford had
got them from Hilliard because of his success with "Dear Geraldine" by
the same author. They had all coveted it because it was one of those
combinations about the success of which there could be no doubt. In
offering Weiner a half-interest Mr. Vandeford was aware that he was
offering him at least a hundred thousand dollars, but Mr. Vandeford's
hunch about the purple on purple was beginning to cost him dear, though
at least a hundred thousand dollars did not seem too much to pay to keep
the agony of failure out of a pair of sea-gray eyes that had trusted him
the first time they had looked into his.
</p><p>"With Hawtry it goes; without Hawtry, no, Mr. Vandeford," was the prompt
answer.
</p><p>"With Hawtry six months from now?" questioned Mr. Vandeford.
</p><p>"It is that I have a weak heart, Mr. Vandeford, and I do not trade in
futures," answered Mr. Weiner, with a spark in his black eyes.
</p><p>"You know my fix, Weiner; now what will you take for the New Carnival
October first for my Hawtry show?"
</p><p>"I will trade that entire 'Rosie Posie Girl' manuscript, with all rights
for that New Carnival Theater on October first, with option for the
entire season, Mr. Vandeford," said Mr. Weiner, rolling his big cigar
from one side of his mouth to the other.
</p><p>"Without Hawtry?"
</p><p>"I have a new Hawtry right now--in pickle," Mr. Weiner answered.
</p><p>"Will the New Carnival certainly be finished October first?"
</p><p>"Yes, to a certainty of a large guarantee."
</p><p>"How long will you give me to answer?" asked Mr. Vandeford.
</p><p>"I have made an appointment with S. &amp; K. to talk that New Carnival
Theater for a show at five o'clock to-day, Mr. Vandeford. I will call it
six o'clock for you," answered Weiner, as he turned the screw with all
show of consideration for his fellow producer.
</p><p>"I'll be back at four-forty-five," Mr. Vandeford answered him, and with
no further good-by took his departure.
</p><p>Arriving at his office, Mr. Vandeford directed Mr. Meyers that he was to
have half an hour entirely undisturbed, entered his own office, and
after a second's pause went into the little office that had been
assigned to Miss Adair, the author, and sat down in the chair she very
seldom occupied, but which was hers by tenancy. On the desk were a pair
of silk gloves she had left there the day before, and in a blue vase
were several roses in a good state of preservation, which he recognized
as having come from a bunch Miss Adair had been wearing after having had
luncheon with Mr. Gerald Height on Monday. These objects disturbed Mr.
Vandeford vaguely. He put them out of his mind roughly and went into
conference with himself sternly. Literally he was weighing the
question.
</p><p>On one side of the balance he laid "The Rosie Posie Girl," which, with
Hawtry, was sure to run on Broadway for at least two seasons and make
for him a fortune that was indefinitely large and sure. Beside this, its
production would insure him a position among the country's really great
producers. The show was big enough in conception to admit of a
spectacularly artistic treatment, which he had intended to give it so
that it would place musical comedy on a plane upon which it had never
stood before. He knew himself well enough to know that a real triumph of
that kind once accomplished, he would want to turn to other fields of
endeavor, and he could see his greater self standing patiently waiting
for his lesser to be liberated by the process of climbing out of the
very top of the theatrical profession.
</p><p>Sternly he turned from himself to the filling of the other pan of the
scales in which he was weighing the question. He looked for something to
put in to over-balance the certainty of "The Rosie Posie Girl," and
found nothing but a vast uncertainty with many potentialities. "The
Purple Slipper" was a play of no known classification, and with Hawtry
in it was still less fish, flesh, fowl, or good red herring. And there
was added the uncertainty of that week from the twenty-third to the
first during which he had no legal hold on the fair Violet. He felt
reasonably sure that the announcement that "The Purple Slipper" would
open the big new Weiner theater, with all the clash of publicity which
he could give to it, would hold her steady on her job, but as he laid it
down on the scales, it had to be classed as an uncertainty. The fifteen
per cent. seat sales based on Mr. Gerald Height's appearance in silk
tights, velvet, and lace was about the only positive he had to lay in
the scales, and that, of course, failed to tip them to any degree. For
about fifteen minutes he sat perfectly rigid. Then he gently laid on the
uncertain side of the scales the positive and concrete faith in a pair
of sea-gray eyes, jeweled with tears, and watched "The Rosie Posie
Girl" rise high as "The Purple Slipper" sank down heavily.
</p><p>After this he took a rose from the green vase, stuck it in his
buttonhole, and went forth--into his own office. He there rang his
buzzer for Mr. Meyers, and seated himself with the air of a man who has
had a burden lifted off his shoulders rather than with the air of one
about to give away half a million dollars.
</p><p>"Pops, 'The Rosie Posie Girl' is sold, lock, stock, and barrel, to
Weiner for a month's try-out of 'The Purple Slipper' at the New Carnival
Theater, good guarantee for that month, and an option on a run to the
limit for eight-thousand-a-week houses. Get Lusky over the 'phone, and
you and he have the contracts drawn as tight as wax by four-thirty."
</p><p>"But, Mr. Vandeford, sir, I must have a say that--"
</p><p>"No, Pops, don't say anything."
</p><p>"With a pardon it is that I think that Miss Adair is a very fine lady,
and so also 'The Purple Slipper.'" With this incoherent pronouncement
of sympathy and encouragement, though devastated at the loss of "The
Rosie Posie Girl," upon which he had already spent many creative days,
Mr. Meyers departed into the outer office.
</p><p>For a long minute Mr. Vandeford glared at the unoffending rose in his
buttonhole, then smiled, ran his hands through his hair, turned to the
telephone, and plunged into the last lap of the race of "The Purple
Slipper." Until four o'clock he was closeted with the most brilliant
theatrical publicity man in New York City; then he took his contracts
and went over to Weiner's office and sacrificed "The Rosie Posie Girl"
to--
</p><p>An hour later he had told his partner, Mr. Dennis Farraday, all about
it, and showed him the deeds of execution.
</p><p>"You ought not to have done it, Van. It was too big a price to pay," Mr.
Farraday declared, with his mane rumpled on high.
</p><p>"No," answered Mr. Vandeford, in happy calmness. "'The Purple Slipper'
will pay it all out--one way or another."
</p><p>"It must," declared Mr. Farraday, with helpless energy. "What can I do?"
</p><p>"Oh, be the usual ray of sunshine around the place and--and keep the
Violet happy and busy until we land on Broadway." Mr. Vandeford said
this with a coldness in tone and voice that he had to force hard. His
attitude was that he had had to sacrifice himself so why not sacrifice
Mr. Farraday also? And he hated himself for that attitude.
</p><p>"I understand, and you can count on me," answered Mr. Farraday, with
such an innocently happy face that Mr. Vandeford groaned inwardly at the
fact that he did not understand, and would surely be made to soon if his
calculations on the intentions of Miss Hawtry were correct.
</p><p>"I've arranged for a chair-car to take the whole company down to
Atlantic City Sunday morning, so the whole bunch can have a plunge and a
good rest-up before the Monday dress rehearsal." Mr. Farraday produced
that piece of business with great pride.
</p><p>"Good!" was all the commendation that he got, and he betook himself off
for other good-natured efforts on the affairs of "The Purple Slipper."
</p><p>Though at times Mr. Godfrey Vandeford approached the heroic in action,
he was very human in reflexes and, having paid a price for the happiness
of Miss Patricia Adair, he proceeded to partake of as much of that
happiness as he could get hold of. He captured the author of "The Purple
Slipper" after the rehearsals on Friday, which were the last before the
dress rehearsal in Atlantic City on Monday night, because the cast of a
play are, after all, so many human beings, who have to be given at least
a day for such animal functions as packing trunks, closing apartments,
dodging creditors, and severing home ties, and he carried her off to the
country with the intention of having her all to himself for dinner at a
little inn up Westchester way. After they had started in that direction
and were flying behind Valentine along sun-gilded country lanes, he
changed his mind, changed the road slightly, and had them landed under
the wing of Mrs. Farraday for dinner. He did this with direct intention.
He judged himself, and decided that it would be safest to announce to
Miss Adair that her play was to have the honor of opening the great New
Carnival Theatre on Broadway somewhere within two hundred yards of Mrs.
Farraday. This program he carried out with efficient directness and then
found a strange lacking in himself.
</p><p>"Oh, how wonderful you are!" was Miss Adair's exclamation when he had
imparted his news just as a young moon was silvering the poplar under
which they sat on an old stone bench at the bottom of the sunken garden.
"Everybody has said that you couldn't do it, but I didn't worry at all
like the rest of them. I knew that you could."
</p><p>"How did you know that I could do it?" he asked, and he rejoiced with
pride that his author did not yet know of either the existence or his
sacrifice of "The Rosie Posie Girl."
</p><p>"Why, I don't know--I knew just because I--I--" For the first time Mr.
Vandeford was absolutely certain of the flutter towards him, and at the
same time felt certain that he was the first man who ever had been
certain of it; and just as his breast and arms were hollowing themselves
to nest it he--denied it and himself. He didn't want it at a purchase
price, and he took Miss Adair home and locked her in the Y. W. C. A.
before midnight.
</p><p>The journey down to Atlantic City on Sunday morning was accomplished
with much joy and hilarity. The entire cast of "The Purple Slipper"
acted like boys and girls let out of school, and mischievous children at
that. Miss Adair enjoyed it all immensely, and at times she very timidly
joined in the fun, which was centering itself upon putting Mr. Leigh of
the uncertain feet, and Miss Grayson, the glowerer, into white ribbon
bonds, which bonds were supplied from a large box of bonbons, the
identity of the donor of which she refused to reveal, though Mr. Kent
declared he had brought her to the station in a gold limousine with
diamond wheels, and bore the name of Billy Astorbilt.
</p><p>Only Miss Hawtry held aloof, as she and her maid and various pieces of
ultra luggage occupied the four seats at the end of the car. The seat
next her was kept vacant, and at various times during the several hours'
run Mr. Vandeford, Mr. Height, and Miss Adair occupied it with
respectful tribute, but most of the time Mr. Farraday sat considerately
beside her, and smiled upon the fun. Mr. William Rooney and Fido rode in
the day-coach and worked the entire way on duplicate prompt copies.
</p><p>Also Mr. Rooney and Fido were absent that evening from the dinner-party
given by Mr. Farraday in the great new hotel to the entire cast of "The
Purple Slipper"--in honor of Miss Hawtry. They were working with the
stage-carpenter, the property-man, and the electrician until a late
hour, when they met the members of the dinner-party in pairs in
wheel-chairs being trundled along the board-walk for sea air before
retiring.
</p><p>"Hope the angel gave the bunch enough drink to keep 'em asleep until
two-thirty to-morrow," Mr. Rooney remarked to Fido as he spat out into
the Atlantic Ocean. "I'm going to put the gaff to 'em to-morrow night,
and I want to start with 'em unstrung and string 'em to suit myself.
That little author is some girl, but I wonder why Vandeford wanted to
shunt that white devil onto a nice boob like Farraday, and him his
friend, too," he further remarked as he watched the star and the angel
being trundled by in one of the big wicker perambulators that infest the
board walk.
</p><p>In the other direction were being trundled the author and the producer
of "The Purple Slipper," and at that moment they were in the mood of
fellow-workmen at the machine of "The Purple Slipper."
</p><p>"Rooney sent me word that the lighting is doubtful. This rotten little
theater is hard to count on for any kind of unusual lighting, and we
must have that diffusion for the dinner scene so as to make the candle
effect seem real," Mr. Vandeford was saying with great animation to Miss
Adair and with a total lack of sentiment under the same young moon that
had baffled him Friday night out in Westchester.
</p><p>"The whole thing seems a confused jumble to me," admitted Miss Adair. "I
feel as if I couldn't wait until to-morrow night to really see the play
with the costumes and scenery and love scenes and all in the right
place. And yet I'm so tired I feel as if I could sleep a week."
</p><p>"I'll shake you if you go dead on me here as you did the other night in
the car," threatened Mr. Vandeford, with a laugh, but he adjusted his
shoulder back of hers as if he considered the danger entirely real.
</p><p>"I'll certainly do it if you don't take me back where I belong, wherever
it is," threatened Miss Adair. "I hope Mildred isn't as--as tired as I
am and--and can help me. I'll go to bed with my clothes on if she
doesn't," Miss Adair gasped between yawns, and fluttered to Mr.
Vandeford with a frank intention of gaining support.
</p><p>"Back to the hotel, boy, and go a good pace. Double tip," commanded Mr.
Vandeford to their propelling Italian youth, with an alarm which puzzled
him as much as it would have puzzled many of his friends, while he
accorded his exhausted author the amount of support needed for the
occasion--and no more.
</p><p>And as Mr. Rooney had hoped, the entire cast of "The Purple Slipper"
slept into the afternoon of the dress-rehearsal day in the complete
collapse which the sea air induced, and they were in a good condition
for restringing. In fact, some of them began that process for themselves
by an afternoon plunge in the ocean.
</p><p>One of those plunges had an after-effect on the fate of "The Purple
Slipper" further than keying up Mr. Gerald Height for his dress
rehearsals. When he discovered, while detaining Miss Adair for a chat
after his late luncheon, that the author had never beheld the sea before
in all her inland existence, and had never been in it, he insisted on
procuring a bathing-suit and initiating her into that sport. She
assented to the proposition with the greatest eagerness, and in less
than half an hour she had trusted herself to the arms of Mr. Gerald
Height and the Atlantic Ocean. They were both rough in their handling,
and finally she came to resent the boldness of the former as much as she
enjoyed that of the latter. With crimson in her cheeks and lightning in
her eyes, she first attempted to drown them both, then waded to shore,
sat down on the sand, and said things to Mr. Gerald Height, which had
the magic effect of making him unburden himself and his lizard-like
career to her in its entirety.
</p><p>"You see, I didn't know what a girl who--who wrote your play was like
exactly, and because I couldn't find out I have kept on trying.
Now--now, by George, I know," he said, with a boyishness coming into his
murky eyes. "Say, you know my mother was a Kentucky girl, and I guess
that is one reason I have stuck by this fool--this 'Purple Slipper.'
That and wanting to chase you down."
</p><p>"Well, now that you've 'chased me down' and found that I'm not--not
there, you'll stay by me and 'The Purple Slipper,' won't you?" Miss
Adair asked, and then like two merry children they both laughed at her
jumble.
</p><p>"I will," answered Mr. Height, with the queer attachment in his heart
that a man feels for a perfectly good woman who is jolly and friendly
with him after she has allowed him to tell her just how wicked he is or
thinks he is. "I thought the whole thing was a flivver, but when
Vandeford got the opening of the New Carnival for it, I sat up and took
notice. Just you watch the stuff between Hawtry and me put a line a mile
long from the box office."
</p><p>"I'm wild to see you and Miss Hawtry in your scenes, and we must go to
dress for early dinner. The rehearsals are called for six-thirty. Thank
you for--for being my friend." As she rose from the sand Miss Adair held
out her hand to Mr. Height, with the friendliness and confidence in her
eyes that had smoothed over other rough, though not so rough, places of
the same character in her young life.
</p><p>"That's some kid and there are lots like her. I've got to halt sooner or
later," Mr. Height muttered to himself as he dressed for his early
dinner. "I'm going to put this fool play across for her, too." There are
a few women who distill loyalty out of declined passion; but not many.
They make their mark on their generation.
</p><p>The dress rehearsals of a play are varied in finish and intensity, but
the variety which Mr. William Rooney conducted was of the most
brilliant, and he expected them to go as well as the opening night. He
made small allowance for the strangeness of lights, scenery, and
costuming, and that allowance was only for time, not in smoothness. As
he willed, his cast generally performed. The cast of "The Purple
Slipper" was of experienced actors, and he felt certain that they would
meet his expectations. At six-thirty o'clock he seated himself in the
middle seat of the sixth row center, looked around to see that the
electrician and the costumer were at hand to catch any criticism he
wished to make, and in a crisp hard voice that exploded like a cannon he
called up the curtain.
</p><p>The author was at her post in the left stage box, and bulwarked and
buttressed by the producer as usual, while Mr. Dennis Farraday, the
angel, sat alone in the box opposite, with a delighted smile on his
broad face.
</p><p>The curtain went up, and "The Purple Slipper" glided on the stage with
never a creak or a careen. The lights scintillated and glared on the
wonderful costumes and scenery, and the sparkling dialogue began to
unwind itself into the startling plot. For the first ten minutes the
author glowed with such joyous excitement that the producer felt the
actual radiations; then little by little he felt her begin to cool, and
a chill ran up and down his own spine as Hawtry and Height held the
stage alone in the first dash of Howard-"pepped" dalliance near the last
of the first act. He held his breath, frozen within him, until the
curtain went down, and then he refused to turn to the author at his
side. He was in a panic and undecided what to do until Mr. Rooney
relieved him of the need of action.
</p><p>"Mr. Vandeford," he commanded from the middle of the theater, "get New
York on the wire and have Lindenberg start a good scenery man out on the
early morning train. That back-drop must have a toning wash: it jumps
out at the costumes. Lindenberg is in his office until seven to get a
message from you. It's ten to now. You gotter jump."
</p><p>Without a look at Miss Adair, Mr. Vandeford "jumped," and thus she was
left alone to watch the second act grind along to its climax, with
Hawtry acting the high-bred virago with an extremity of brilliant
sensuality, with Mr. Height supporting her in broad lines that could be
well-read between. Once the author looked at Mr. Dennis Farraday in the
box opposite, and then looked away from his blazing enjoyment of the
startling climax, which the lovers acted in such beauty of body, and
such beauty of execution that, without knowing why, she was thrilled
from her head to her feet.
</p><p>"Broad standards," she whispered to encourage herself, as her eyes shone
and her cheeks glowed as she lowered her head and re-read the proof of
the program to be used on Tuesday night, which Mr. Vandeford had given
her and upon which she observed the name Patricia Adair in type only
slightly smaller than that of Violet Hawtry. In a few minutes the
curtain was again called up; Mr. Vandeford was still absent, and again
her attention was riveted to the stage.
</p><p>Almost the entire first half of the last act was hers, and the tension
in her glowing young body had relaxed and she gave Mr. Vandeford a
semblance of a smile as he seated himself beside her just before Hawtry
came on the scene to lay with Height the foundation of the great dinner
scene. This hurdle was held firmly in front of the young author.
</p><p>Miss Hawtry entered in a blaze of eighteenth century glory, only with
her authentic costume cunningly contrived to reveal more of her
wonderful white body than any woman of that period would have done, and
beautiful in his velvet and ruffles, Gerald Height followed her to
thereupon enact a scene which was a slow and marvellous distilling of
the very wine of emotion intended to go through human blood like a
stinging poison. It had reached its climax, and even the emptiness of
the theater was breathless when, like a whip, Mr. Rooney's cold voice
brought Miss Hawtry out of Mr. Height's arms.
</p><p>"Cut it, cut it!" he commanded. "You couldn't get that across even on
Broadway. The censor will close the show. Play it fifty per cent. and
then all the subway will quit you."
</p><p>"I'll play it as I choose, you black monkey, you, with your Irish name."
Maggie Murphy sprang out from the body of the beautiful Hawtry to answer
back gutter with gutter.
</p><p>"Wait a minute, Miss Hawtry." Mr. Vandeford rose in his box from beside
the author of the violent scene that was becoming a basis of a scene of
violence. "Rooney, it can be played with--"
</p><p>"You sit down and help your bread-and-butter baby hide her face for
writing such rot instead of trying to tell me how to act." Maggie was
now commanding the Violet, and she was wild with nervous rage. "She's
welcome to you; five years of your living off me and my work is enough,
and I don't intend to--"
</p><p>"Back to your lines on which Miss Hawtry enters, Miss Lindsey,"
commanded Mr. Rooney, in his machine-gun manner. "Get ready for your
cue, Height."
</p><p>Completely ignoring Miss Hawtry, who was standing down center, Mildred
Lindsey calmly entered and began the beautiful little bit of persiflage
with Miss Herne, who had gone on before her with an agility unlike her
usual slow gait. There was nothing for Miss Hawtry to do but retire to
the wings, which she did, and with the nervous bomb exploded, she
continued the rehearsals to a finish with the greatest brilliancy,
playing the interrupted scene at fifty per cent. of its fire, as
directed by Mr. Rooney.
</p><p>But the author of "The Purple Slipper" was not there to see the ending
in calm after the storm, for she had fled at the Violet's attack upon
Mr. Vandeford, and while he stood his ground to see the matter settled
in the face of the insult, she had vanished.
