<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I once read &mdash;I think in some Latin writer&mdash;the story of
a man who was crushed to a jelly by the mere repeated touch of
many thousand hands. His murderers were not harsh, but an infinite
repetition of the gentlest handling meant death.  I do not suppose
that I was very brutally manhandled in the cave. I was trussed
up tight and carried out to the open, and left in the care of
the guards.  But when my senses returned I felt as if I had been
cruelly beaten in every part.  The raw-hide bonds chafed my wrists
and ankle and shoulders, but they were the least part of my aches. 
To be handled by a multitude of Kaffirs is like being shaken by
some wild animal.  Their skins are insensible to pain, and I have
seen a Zulu stand on a piece of red-hot iron without noticing
it till he was warned by the smell of burning hide.  Anyhow, after
I had been bound by Kaffir hands and tossed on Kaffir shoulders,
I felt as if I had been in a scrimmage of mad bulls. I found myself
lying looking up at the moon.  It was the edge of the bush, and
all around was the stir of the army getting ready for the road. 
You know how a native babbles and chatters over any work he has
to do.  It says much for Laputa's iron hand that now everything
was done in silence.  I heard the nickering of horses and the
jolt of carts as they turned from the bush into the path.  There
was the sound of hurried whispering, and now and then a sharp
command.  And all the while I lay, staring at the moon and wondering
if I was going to keep my reason.</p>

<p>If he who reads this doubts the discomfort of bonds let him try
them for himself.  Let him be bound foot and hand and left alone,
and in half an hour he will be screaming for release. The sense
of impotence is stifling, and I felt as if I were buried in some
landslip instead of lying under the open sky, with the night wind
fanning my face.  I was in the second stage of panic, which is
next door to collapse.  I tried to cry, but could only raise a
squeak like a bat.  A wheel started to run round in my head, and,
when I looked at the moon, I saw that it was rotating in time. 
Things were very bad with me. It was 'Mwanga who saved me from
lunacy.  He had been appointed my keeper, and the first I knew
of it was a violent kick in the ribs.  I rolled over on the grass
down a short slope. The brute squatted beside me, and prodded
me with his gun-barrel.</p>

<p>'Ha, Baas,' he said in his queer English.  'Once you ordered
me out of your store and treated me like a dog.  It is 'Mwanga's
turn now.  You are 'Mwanga's dog, and he will skin you with a
sjambok soon.'</p>

<p>My wandering wits were coming back to me.  I looked into his
bloodshot eyes and saw what I had to expect.  The cheerful savage
went on to discuss just the kind of beating I should get from
him.  My bones were to be uncovered till the lash curled round
my heart.  Then the jackals would have the rest of me.</p>

<p>This was ordinary Kaffir brag, and it made me angry.  But I thought
it best to go cannily.</p>

<p>'If I am to be your slave,' I managed to say, 'it would be a
pity to beat me so hard.  You would get no more work out of me.'</p>

<p>'Mwanga grinned wickedly.  'You are my slave for a day and a
night. After that we kill you&mdash;slowly.  You will burn till your
legs fall off and your knees are on the ground, and then you will
be chopped small with knives.'</p>

<p>Thank God, my courage and common sense were coming back to me.</p>

<p>'What happens to me to-morrow,' I said, 'is the Inkulu's business,
not yours.  I am his prisoner.  But if you lift your hand on me
to-day so as to draw one drop of blood the Inkulu will make short
work of you. The vow is upon you, and if you break it you know
what happens.'  And I repeated, in a fair imitation of the priest's
voice, the terrible curse he had pronounced in the cave.</p>

<p>You should have seen the change in that cur's face.  I had guessed
he was a coward, as he was most certainly a bully, and now I knew
it.  He shivered, and drew his hand over his eyes.</p>

<p>'Nay, Baas,' he pleaded, 'it was but a joke.  No harm shall come
on you to-day.  But tomorrow&mdash;' and his ugly face grew more cheerful.</p>

<p>'To-morrow we shall see what we shall see,' I said stoically,
and a loud drum-beat sounded through the camp.</p>

<p>It was the signal for moving, for in the east a thin pale line
of gold was beginning to show over the trees.  The bonds at my
knees and ankles were cut, and I was bundled on to the back of
a horse.  Then my feet were strapped firmly below its belly. The
bridle of my beast was tied to 'Mwanga's, so that there was little
chance of escape even if I had been unshackled.</p>

<p>My thoughts were very gloomy.  So far all had happened as I planned,
but I seemed to have lost my nerve, and I could not believe in
my rescue at the Letaba, while I thought of Inanda's Kraal with
sheer horror.  Last night I had looked into the heart of darkness,
and the sight had terrified me.  What part should I play in the
great purification?  Most likely that of the Biblical scapegoat. 
But the dolour of my mind was surpassed by the discomfort of my
body.  I was broken with pains and weariness, and I had a desperate
headache.  Also, before we had gone a mile, I began to think that
I should split in two. The paces of my beast were uneven, to say
the best of it, and the bump-bump was like being on the rack. 
I remembered that the saints of the Covenant used to journey to
prison this way, especially the great Mr Peden, and I wondered
how they liked it.  When I hear of a man doing a brave deed, I
always want to discover whether at the time he was well and comfortable
in body. That, I am certain, is the biggest ingredient in courage,
and those who plan and execute great deeds in bodily weakness
have my homage as truly heroic.  For myself, I had not the spirit
of a chicken as I jogged along at 'Mwanga's side.  I wished he
would begin to insult me, if only to distract my mind, but he
kept obstinately silent.  He was sulky, and I think rather afraid
of me.</p>

<p>As the sun got up I could see something of the host around me. 
I am no hand at guessing numbers, but I should put the fighting
men I saw at not less than twenty thousand.  Every man of them
was on this side his prime, and all were armed with good rifles
and bandoliers.  There were none of your old roers[1] and decrepit
Enfields, which I had seen signs of in Kaffir kraals.  These guns
were new, serviceable Mausers, and the men who bore them looked
as if they knew how to handle them.  There must have been long
months of training behind this show, and I marvelled at the man
who had organized it.  I saw no field-guns, and the little transport
they had was evidently for food only.  We did not travel in ranks
like an orthodox column.  About a third of the force was mounted,
and this formed the centre.  On each wing the infantry straggled
far afield, but there was method in their disorder, for in the
bush close ranks would have been impossible.  At any rate we kept
wonderfully well together, and when we mounted a knoll the whole
army seemed to move in one piece.  I was well in the rear of the
centre column, but from the crest of a slope I sometimes got a
view in front. I could see nothing of Laputa, who was probably
with the van, but in the very heart of the force I saw the old
priest of the Snake, with his treasure carried in the kind of
litter which the Portuguese call a machila, between rows of guards. 
A white man rode beside him, whom I judged to be Henriques.  Laputa
trusted this fellow, and I wondered why.  I had not forgotten
the look on his face while he had stared at the rubies in the
cave.  I had a notion that the Portugoose might be an unsuspected
ally of mine, though for blackguard reasons.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock, as far as I could judge by the sun, we passed
Umvelos', and took the right bank of the Labongo. There was nothing
in the store to loot, but it was overrun by Kaffirs, who carried
off the benches for firewood.  It gave me an odd feeling to see
the remains of the meal at which I had entertained Laputa in the
hands of a dozen warriors.  I thought of the long sunny days when
I had sat by my nachtmaal while the Dutch farmers rode in to trade. 
Now these men were all dead, and I was on my way to the same bourne.</p>

<p>Soon the blue line of the Berg rose in the west, and through
the corner of my eye, as I rode, I could see the gap of the Klein
Labongo.  I wondered if Arcoll and his men were up there watching
us.  About this time I began to be so wretched in body that I
ceased to think of the future.  I had had no food for seventeen
hours, and I was dropping from lack of sleep. The ache of my bones
was so great that I found myself crying like a baby.  What between
pain and weakness and nervous exhaustion, I was almost at the
end of my tether, and should have fainted dead away if a halt
had not been called.  But about midday, after we had crossed the
track from Blaauwildebeestefontein to the Portuguese frontier,
we came to the broad, shallow drift of the Klein Labongo.  It
is the way of the Kaffirs to rest at noon, and on the other side
of the drift we encamped. I remember the smell of hot earth and
clean water as my horse scrambled up the bank.  Then came the
smell of wood-smoke as fires were lit.  It seemed an age after
we stopped before my feet were loosed and I was allowed to fall
over on the ground. I lay like a log where I fell, and was asleep
in ten seconds. I awoke two hours later much refreshed, and with
a raging hunger.  My ankles and knees had been tied again, but
the sleep had taken the worst stiffness out of my joints.  The
natives were squatting in groups round their fires, but no one
came near me.  I satisfied myself by straining at my bonds that
this solitude gave no chance of escape.  I wanted food, and I
shouted on 'Mwanga, but he never came.  Then I rolled over into
the shadow of a wacht-en-beetje bush to get out of the glare.</p>

<p>I saw a Kaffir on the other side of the bush who seemed to be
grinning at me.  Slowly he moved round to my side, and stood regarding
me with interest.</p>

<p>'For God's sake get me some food,' I said.</p>

<p>'Ja, Baas,' was the answer; and he disappeared for a minute,
and returned with a wooden bowl of hot mealie-meal porridge, and
a calabash full of water.</p>

<p>I could not use my hands, so he fed me with the blade of his
knife. Such porridge without salt or cream is beastly food, but
my hunger was so great that I could have eaten a vat of it.</p>

<p>Suddenly it appeared that the Kaffir had something to say to
me.  As he fed me he began to speak in a low voice in English.</p>

<p>'Baas,' he said, 'I come from Ratitswan, and I have a message
for you.'</p>

<p>I guessed that Ratitswan was the native name for Arcoll. There
was no one else likely to send a message. 'Ratitswan says,' he
went on, "'Look out for Dupree's Drift." I will be near you and
cut your bonds; then you must swim across when Ratitswan begins
to shoot.'</p>

<p>The news took all the weight of care from my mind.  Colin had
got home, and my friends were out for rescue.  So volatile is
the mood of 19 that I veered round from black despair to an unwarranted
optimism.  I saw myself already safe, and Laputa's rising scattered. 
I saw my hands on the treasure, and Henriques' ugly neck below
my heel.</p>

<p>'I don't know your name,' I said to the Kaffir, 'but you are
a good fellow.  When I get out of this business I won't forget
you.'</p>

<p>'There is another message, Baas,' he said.  'It is written on
paper in a strange tongue.  Turn your head to the bush, and see,
I will hold it inside the bowl, that you may read it.'</p>

<p>I did as I was told, and found myself looking at a dirty half-sheet
of notepaper, marked by the Kaffir's thumbs.  Some words were
written on it in Wardlaw's hand; and, characteristically, in Latin,
which was not a bad cipher.  I read&mdash;</p>

<p>'<em>Henricus de Letaba transeunda apud Duprei vada jam nos certiores
fecit.</em>'[2]</p>

<p>I had guessed rightly.  Henriques was a traitor to the cause
he had espoused.  Arcoll's message had given me new heart, but
Wardlaw's gave me information of tremendous value.  I repented
that I had ever underrated the schoolmaster's sense. He did not
come out of Aberdeen for nothing.</p>

<p>I asked the Kaffir how far it was to Dupree's Drift, and was
told three hours' march.  We should get there after the darkening.
It seemed he had permission to ride with me instead of 'Mwanga,
who had no love for the job.  How he managed this I do not know;
but Arcoll's men had their own ways of doing things.  He undertook
to set me free when the first shot was fired at the ford.  Meantime
I bade him leave me, to avert suspicion.</p>

<p>There is a story of one of King Arthur's knights &mdash;Sir Percival,
I think&mdash;that once, riding through a forest, he found a lion fighting
with a serpent.  He drew his sword and helped the lion, for he
thought it was the more natural beast of the two.  To me Laputa
was the lion, and Henriques the serpent; and though I had no good
will to either, I was determined to spoil the serpent's game. 
He was after the rubies, as I had fancied; he had never been after
anything else. He had found out about Arcoll's preparations, and
had sent him a warning, hoping, no doubt, that, if Laputa's force
was scattered on the Letaba, he would have a chance of getting
off with the necklace in the confusion.  If he succeeded, he would
go over the Lebombo to Mozambique, and whatever happened afterwards
in the rising would be no concern of Mr Henriques. I determined
that he should fail; but how to manage it I could not see. Had
I had a pistol, I think I would have shot him; but I had no weapon
of any kind.  I could not warn Laputa, for that would seal my
own fate, even if I were believed.  It was clear that Laputa must
go to Dupree's Drift, for otherwise I could not escape; and it
was equally clear that I must find the means of spoiling the Portugoose's
game.</p>

<p>A shadow fell across the sunlight, and I looked up to see the
man I was thinking of standing before me.  He had a cigarette
in his mouth, and his hands in the pockets of his riding-breeches.
He stood eyeing me with a curious smile on his face.</p>

<p>'Well, Mr Storekeeper,' he said, 'you and I have met before under
pleasanter circumstances.'</p>

<p>I said nothing, my mind being busy with what to do at the drift.</p>

<p>'We were shipmates, if I am not mistaken,' he said.  'I dare
say you found it nicer work smoking on the after-deck than lying
here in the sun.'</p>

<p>Still I said nothing.  If the man had come to mock me, he would
get no change out of David Crawfurd.</p>

<p>'Tut, tut, don't be sulky.  You have no quarrel with me. Between
ourselves,' and he dropped his voice, 'I tried to save you; but
you had seen rather too much to be safe.  What devil prompted
you to steal a horse and go to the cave?  I don't blame you for
overhearing us; but if you had had the sense of a louse you would
have gone off to the Berg with your news.  By the way, how did
you manage it?  A cellar, I suppose.  Our friend Laputa was a
fool not to take better precautions; but I must say you acted
the drunkard pretty well.'</p>

<p>The vanity of 19 is an incalculable thing.  I rose to the fly.</p>

<p>'I know the kind of precaution you wanted to take,' I muttered.</p>

<p>'You heard that too?  Well, I confess I am in favour of doing
a job thoroughly when I take it up.'</p>

<p>'In the Koodoo Flats, for example,' I said.</p>

<p>He sat down beside me, and laughed softly.  'You heard my little
story? You are clever, Mr Storekeeper, but not quite clever enough. 
What if I can act a part as well as yourself?' And he thrust his
yellow face close to mine.</p>

<p>I saw his meaning, and did not for a second believe him; but
I had the sense to temporize.</p>

<p>'Do you mean to say that you did not kill the Dutchmen, and did
not mean to knife me?'</p>

<p>'I mean to say that I am not a fool,' he said, lighting another
cigarette.</p>

<p>'I am a white man, Mr Storekeeper, and I play the white man's
game. Why do you think I am here?  Simply because I was the only
man in Africa who had the pluck to get to the heart of this business. 
I am here to dish Laputa, and by God I am going to do it.'</p>

<p>I was scarcely prepared for such incredible bluff.  I knew every
word was a lie, but I wanted to hear more, for the man fascinated
me.</p>

<p>'I suppose you know what will happen to you,' he said, flicking
the ashes from his cigarette.  'To-morrow at Inanda's Kraal, when
the vow is over, they will give you a taste of Kaffir habits. 
Not death, my friend&mdash;that would be simple enough&mdash;but a slow
death with every refinement of horror.  You have broken into their
sacred places, and you will be sacrificed to Laputa's god.  I
have seen native torture before, and his own mother would run
away shrieking from a man who had endured it.'</p>

<p>I said nothing, but the thought made my flesh creep.</p>

<p>'Well,' he went on, 'you're in an awkward plight, but I think
I can help you.  What if I can save your life, Mr Storekeeper?
You are trussed up like a fowl, and can do nothing.  I am the
only man alive who can help you.  I am willing to do it, too&mdash;on
my own terms.'</p>

<p>I did not wait to hear those terms, for I had a shrewd guess
what they would be.  My hatred of Henriques rose and choked me. 
I saw murder and trickery in his mean eyes and cruel mouth.  I
could not, to be saved from the uttermost horror, have made myself
his ally.</p>

<p>'Now listen, Mr Portugoose,' I cried.  'You tell me you are a
spy. What if I shout that through the camp?  There will be short
shrift for you if Laputa hears it.'</p>

<p>He laughed loudly.  'You are a bigger fool than I took you for. 
Who would believe you, my friend.  Not Laputa.  Not any man in
this army. It would only mean tighter bonds for these long legs
of yours.'</p>

<p>By this time I had given up all thought of diplomacy.  'Very
well, you yellow-faced devil, you will hear my answer.  I would
not take my freedom from you, though I were to be boiled alive. 
I know you for a traitor to the white man's cause, a dirty <em>I.D.B.
</em>swindler, whose name is a byword among honest men. By your
own confession you are a traitor to this idiot rising. You murdered
the Dutchmen and God knows how many more, and you would fain have
murdered me.  I pray to Heaven that the men whose cause you have
betrayed and the men whose cause you would betray may join to
stamp the life out of you and send your soul to hell. I know the
game you would have me join in, and I fling your offer in your
face.  But I tell you one thing&mdash;you are damned yourself. The
white men are out, and you will never get over the Lebombo. From
black or white you will get justice before many hours, and your
carcass will be left to rot in the bush.  Get out of my sight,
you swine.'</p>

<p>In that moment I was so borne up in my passion that I forgot
my bonds and my grave danger.  I was inspired like a prophet with
a sense of approaching retribution.  Henriques heard me out; but
his smile changed to a scowl, and a flush rose on his sallow cheek.</p>

<p>'Stew in your own juice,' he said, and spat in my face.  Then
he shouted in Kaffir that I had insulted him, and demanded that
I should be bound tighter and gagged.</p>

<p>It was Arcoll's messenger who answered his summons.  That admirable
fellow rushed at me with a great appearance of savagery.  He made
a pretence of swathing me up in fresh rawhide ropes, but his knots
were loose and the thing was a farce. He gagged me with what looked
like a piece of wood, but was in reality a chunk of dry banana. 
And all the while, till Henriques was out of hearing, he cursed
me with a noble gift of tongues.</p>

<p>The drums beat for the advance, and once more I was hoisted on
my horse, while Arcoll's Kaffir tied my bridle to his own.  A
Kaffir cannot wink, but he has a way of slanting his eyes which
does as well, and as we moved on he would turn his head to me
with this strange grimace.</p>

<p>Henriques wanted me to help him to get the rubies&mdash;that I presumed
was the offer he had meant to make.  Well, thought I, I will perish
before the jewel reaches the Portuguese's hands. He hoped for
a stampede when Arcoll opposed the crossing of the river, and
in the confusion intended to steal the casket.  My plan must be
to get as near the old priest as possible before we reached the
ford.  I spoke to my warder and told him what I wanted.  He nodded,
and in the first mile we managed to edge a good way forward. 
Several things came to aid us.  As I have said, we of the centre
were not marching in close ranks, but in a loose column, and often
it was possible by taking a short cut on rough ground to join
the column some distance ahead. There was a vlei, too, which many
circumvented, but we swam, and this helped our lead.  In a couple
of hours we were so near the priest's litter that I could have
easily tossed a cricket ball on the head of Henriques who rode
beside it.</p>

<p>Very soon the twilight of the winter day began to fall.  The
far hills grew pink and mulberry in the sunset, and strange shadows
stole over the bush.  Still creeping forward, we found ourselves
not twenty yards behind the litter, while far ahead I saw a broad,
glimmering space of water with a high woody bank beyond.</p>

<p>'Dupree's Drift;' whispered my warder.  'Courage, Inkoos;[3]
in an hour's time you will be free.'</p>

<p>[1] Boer elephant guns.</p>

<p>[2] 'Henriques has already told us about the crossing at Dupree's
Drift.'</p>

<p>[3] Great chief.</p>
