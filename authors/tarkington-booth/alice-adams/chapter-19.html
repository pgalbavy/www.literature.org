<p>Alice was softly crooning to herself as her mother turned the
corner of the house and approached through the dusk.</p>

<p>"Isn't it the most <em>BEAUTIFUL </em>evening!" the daughter
said. "<em>WHY </em>can't summer last all year? Did you ever know
a lovelier twilight than this, mama?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams laughed, and answered, "Not since I was your age,
I expect."</p>

<p>Alice was wistful at once. "Don't they stay beautiful after my
age?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's not the same thing."</p>

<p>"Isn't it? Not ever?"</p>

<p>"You may have a different kind from mine," the mother said, a
little sadly. "I think you will, Alice. You deserve&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I don't deserve anything, and I know it. But I'm
getting a great deal these days&mdash;more than I ever dreamed <em>COULD
</em>come to me. I'm &mdash;I'm pretty happy, mama!"</p>

<p>"Dearie!" Her mother would have kissed her, but Alice drew away.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean&#11834;" She laughed nervously. "I wasn't meaning
to tell you I'm <em>ENGAGED, </em>mama. We're not. I mean&mdash;oh!
things seem pretty beautiful in spite of all I've done to spoil
'em."</p>

<p>"You?" Mrs. Adams cried, incredulously. "What have you done to
spoil anything?"</p>

<p>"Little things," Alice said. "A thousand little silly&mdash;oh, what's
the use? He's so honestly what he is&mdash;just simple and good and
intelligent &mdash;I feel a tricky mess beside him! I don't see
why he likes me; and sometimes I'm afraid he wouldn't if he knew
me."</p>

<p>"He'd just worship you," said the fond mother. "And the more
he knew you, the more he'd worship you."</p>

<p>Alice shook her head. "He's not the worshiping kind. Not like
that at all. He's more&#11834;"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Adams was not interested in this analysis, and she interrupted
briskly, "Of course it's time your father and I showed some interest
in him. I was just saying I actually don't believe he's ever been
inside the house."</p>

<p>"No," Alice said, musingly; "that's true: I don't believe he
has. Except when we've walked in the evening we've always sat
out here, even those two times when it was drizzly. It's so much
nicer."</p>

<p>"We'll have to do <em>SOMETHING </em>or other, of course," her
mother said.</p>

<p>"What like?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking&#11834;" Mrs. Adams paused. "Well, of course we could
hardly put off asking him to dinner, or something, much longer."</p>

<p>Alice was not enthusiastic; so far from it, indeed, that there
was a melancholy alarm in her voice. "Oh, mama, must we? Do you
think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I really do."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we&mdash;well, couldn't we wait?"</p>

<p>"It looks queer," Mrs. Adams said. "It isn't the thing at all
for a young man to come as much as he does, and never more than
just barely meet your father and mother. No. We ought to do something."</p>

<p>"But a dinner!" Alice objected. "In the first place, there isn't
anybody I want to ask. There isn't anybody I <em>WOULD </em>ask."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean trying to give a big dinner," her mother explained.
"I just mean having him to dinner. That mulatto woman, Malena
Burns, goes out by the day, and she could bring a waitress. We
can get some flowers for the table and some to put in the living-room.
We might just as well go ahead and do it to-morrow as any other
time; because your father's in a fine mood, and I saw Malena this
afternoon and told her I might want her soon. She said she didn't
have any engagements this week, and I can let her know to-night.
Suppose when he comes you ask him for to-morrow, Alice. Everything'll
be very nice, I'm sure. Don't worry about it."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;but&#11834;" Alice was uncertain.</p>

<p>"But don't you see, it looks so queer, not to do <em>SOMETHING?"
</em>her mother urged. "It looks so kind of poverty-stricken.
We really oughtn't to wait any longer."</p>

<p>Alice assented, though not with a good heart. "Very well, I'll
ask him, if you think we've got to."</p>

<p>"That matter's settled then," Mrs. Adams said. "I'll go telephone
Malena, and then I'll tell your father about it."</p>

<p>But when she went back to her husband, she found him in an excited
state of mind, and Walter standing before him in the darkness.
Adams was almost shouting, so great was his vehemence.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" his wife implored, as she came near them. "They'll
hear you out on the front porch!"</p>

<p>"I don't care who hears me," Adams said, harshly, though he tempered
his loudness. "Do you want to know what this boy's asking me for?
I thought he'd maybe come to tell me he'd got a little sense in
his head at last, and a little decency about what's due his family!
I thought he was going to ask me to take him into my plant. No,
ma'am; <em>THAT'S </em>not what he wants!"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," Walter said. In the darkness his face could not
be seen; he stood motionless, in what seemed an apathetic attitude;
and he spoke quietly, "No," he repeated. "That isn't what I want."</p>

<p>"You stay down at that place," Adams went on, hotly, "instead
of trying to be a little use to your family; and the only reason
you're <em>ALLOWED </em>to stay there is because Mr. Lamb's never
happened to notice you <em>ARE </em>still there! You just wait&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You're off," Walter said, in the same quiet way. "He knows I'm
there. He spoke to me yesterday: he asked me how I was getting
along with my work."</p>

<p>"He did?" Adams said, seeming not to believe him.</p>

<p>"Yes. He did."</p>

<p>"What else did he say, Walter?" Mrs. Adams asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Nothin'. Just walked on."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he knew who you were," Adams declared.</p>

<p>"Think not? He called me 'Walter Adams.'"</p>

<p>At this Adams was silent; and Walter, after waiting a moment,
said:</p>

<p>"Well, are you going to do anything about me? About what I told
you I got to have?"</p>

<p>"What is it, Walter?" his mother asked, since Adams did not speak.</p>

<p>Walter cleared his throat, and replied in a tone as quiet as
that he had used before, though with a slight huskiness, "I got
to have three hundred and fifty dollars. You better get him to
give it to me if you can."</p>

<p>Adams found his voice. "Yes," he said, bitterly. "That's all
he asks! He won't do anything I ask <em>HIM </em>to, and in return
he asks me for three hundred and fifty dollars! That's all!"</p>

<p>"What in the world!" Mrs. Adams exclaimed. "What <em>FOR, </em>Walter?"</p>

<p>"I got to have it," Walter said.</p>

<p>"But what <em>FOR</em>?"</p>

<p>His quiet huskiness did not alter. "I got to have it."</p>

<p>"But can't you tell us&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I got to have it."</p>

<p>"That's all you can get out of him," Adams said. "He seems to
think it'll bring him in three hundred and fifty dollars!"</p>

<p>A faint tremulousness became evident in the husky voice. "Haven't
you got it?"</p>

<p>"NO, I haven't got it!" his father answered. "And I've got to
go to a bank for more than my pay-roll next week. Do you think
I'm a mint?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand what you mean, Walter," Mrs. Adams interposed,
perplexed and distressed. "If your father had the money, of course
he'd need every cent of it, especially just now, and, anyhow,
you could scarcely expect him to give it to you, unless you told
us what you want with it. But he hasn't got it."</p>

<p>"All right," Walter said; and after standing a moment more, in
silence, he added, impersonally, "I don't see as you ever did
anything much for me, anyhow either of you."</p>

<p>Then, as if this were his valedictory, he turned his back upon
them, walked away quickly, and was at once lost to their sight
in the darkness.</p>

<p>"There's a fine boy to've had the trouble of raising!" Adams
grumbled. "Just crazy, that's all."</p>

<p>"What in the world do you suppose he wants all that money for?"
his wife said, wonderingly. "I can't imagine what he could DO
with it. I wonder&#11834;" She paused. "I wonder if he&#11834;"</p>

<p>"If he what?" Adams prompted her irritably.</p>

<p>"If he <em>COULD </em>have bad&mdash;associates."</p>

<p>"God knows!" said Adams. "<em>I</em> don't! It just looks to
me like he had something in him I don't understand. You can't
keep your eye on a boy all the time in a city this size, not a
boy Walter's age. You got a girl pretty much in the house, but
a boy'll follow his nature. <em>I</em> don't know what to do with
him!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams brightened a little. "He'll come out all right," she
said. "I'm sure he will. I'm sure he'd never be anything really
bad: and he'll come around all right about the glue-works, too;
you'll see. Of course every young man wants money&mdash;it doesn't
prove he's doing anything wrong just because he asks you for it."</p>

<p>"No. All it proves to me is that he hasn't got good sense asking
me for three hundred and fifty dollars, when he knows as well
as you do the position I'm in! If I wanted to, I couldn't hardly
let him have three hundred and fifty cents, let alone dollars!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll have to let ME have that much&mdash;and maybe a
little more," she ventured, timidly; and she told him of her plans
for the morrow. He objected vehemently.</p>

<p>"Oh, but Alice has probably asked him by this time," Mrs. Adams
said. "It really must be done, Virgil: you don't want him to think
she's ashamed of us, do you?"</p>

<p>"Well, go ahead, but just let me stay away," he begged. "Of course
I expect to undergo a kind of talk with him, when he gets ready
to say something to us about Alice, but I do hate to have to sit
through a fashionable dinner."</p>

<p>"Why, it isn't going to bother you," she said; "just one young
man as a guest."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but you want to have all this fancy cookin'; and
I see well enough you're going to get that old dress suit out
of the cedar chest in the attic, and try to make me put it on
me."</p>

<p>"I do think you better, Virgil."</p>

<p>"I hope the moths have got in it," he said. "Last time I wore
it was to the banquet, and it was pretty old then. Of course I
didn't mind wearing it to the banquet so much, because that was
what you might call quite an occasion." He spoke with some reminiscent
complacency; "the banquet,"  an affair now five years past, having
provided the one time in his life when he had been so distinguished
among his fellow-citizens as to receive an invitation to be present,
with some seven hundred others, at the annual eating and speech-making
of the city's Chamber of Commerce. "Anyhow, as you say, I think
it would look foolish of me to wear a dress suit for just one
young man," he went on protesting, feebly. "What's the use of
all so much howdy-do, anyway? You don't expect him to believe
we put on all that style every night, do you? Is that what you're
after?"</p>

<p>"Well, we want him to think we live nicely," she admitted.</p>

<p>"So that's it!" he said, querulously. "You want him to think
that's our regular gait, do you? Well, he'll know better about
me, no matter how you fix me up, because he saw me in my regular
suit the evening she introduced me to him, and he could tell anyway
I'm not one of these moving-picture sporting-men that's always
got a dress suit on. Besides, you and Alice certainly have some
idea he'll come <em>AGAIN, </em>haven't you? If they get things
settled between 'em he'll be around the house and to meals most
any time, won't he? You don't hardly expect to put on style all
the time, I guess. Well, he'll see then that this kind of thing
was all show-off, and bluff, won't he? What about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, by <em>THAT </em>time&#11834;" She left the sentence unfinished,
as if absently. "You could let us have a little money for to-morrow,
couldn't you, honey?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon, I reckon," he mumbled. "A girl like Alice is some
comfort: she don't come around acting as if she'd commit suicide
if she didn't get three hundred and fifty dollars in the next
five minutes. I expect I can spare five or six dollars for your
show-off if I got to."</p>

<p>However, she finally obtained fifteen before his bedtime; and
the next morning "went to market" after breakfast, leaving Alice
to make the beds. Walter had not yet come downstairs. "You had
better call him,"  Mrs. Adams said, as she departed with a big
basket on her arm. "I expect he's pretty sleepy; he was out so
late last night I didn't hear him come in, though I kept awake
till after midnight, listening for him. Tell him he'll be late
to work if he doesn't hurry; and see that he drinks his coffee,
even if he hasn't time for anything else. And when Malena comes,
get her started in the kitchen: show her where everything is."
She waved her hand, as she set out for a corner where the cars
stopped. "Everything'll be lovely. Don't forget about Walter."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Alice forgot about Walter for a few minutes. She
closed the door, went into the "living-room" absently, and stared
vaguely at one of the old brown-plush rocking-chairs there. Upon
her forehead were the little shadows of an apprehensive reverie,
and her thoughts overlapped one another in a fretful jumble. "What
will he think? These old chairs&mdash;they're hideous. I'll scrub those
soot-streaks on the columns: it won't do any good, though. That
long crack in the column&mdash;nothing can help it. What will he think
of papa? I hope mama won't talk too much. When he thinks of Mildred's
house, or of Henrietta's, or any of 'em, beside this &mdash;She
said she'd buy plenty of roses; that ought to help some. Nothing
could be done about these horrible chairs: can't take 'em up in
the attic&mdash;a room's got to have chairs! Might have rented some.
No; if he ever comes again he'd see they weren't here. 'If he
ever comes again'&mdash;oh, it won't be <em>THAT </em>bad! But it won't
be what he expects. I'm responsible for what he expects: he expects
just what the airs I've put on have made him expect. What did
I want to pose so to him for&mdash;as if papa were a wealthy man and
all that? What <em>WILL </em>he think? The photograph of the Colosseum's
a rather good thing, though. It helps some&mdash;as if we'd bought
it in Rome perhaps. I hope he'll think so; he believes I've been
abroad, of course. The other night he said, 'You remember the
feeling you get in the Sainte-Chapelle'. &mdash;There's another
lie of mine, not saying I didn't remember because I'd never been
there. What makes me do it? Papa <em>MUST </em>wear his evening
clothes. But Walter&#11834;"</p>

<p>With that she recalled her mother's admonition, and went upstairs
to Walter's door. She tapped upon it with her fingers.</p>

<p>"Time to get up, Walter. The rest of us had breakfast over half
an hour ago, and it's nearly eight o'clock. You'll be late. Hurry
down and I'll have some coffee and toast ready for you." There
came no sound from within the room, so she rapped louder.</p>

<p>"Wake up, Walter!"</p>

<p>She called and rapped again, without getting any response, and
then, finding that the door yielded to her, opened it and went
in. Walter was not there.</p>

<p>He had been there, however; had slept upon the bed, though not
inside the covers; and Alice supposed he must have come home so
late that he had been too sleepy to take off his clothes. Near
the foot of the bed was a shallow closet where he kept his "other
suit" and his evening clothes; and the door stood open, showing
a bare wall. Nothing whatever was in the closet, and Alice was
rather surprised at this for a moment. "That's queer," she murmured;
and then she decided that when he woke he found the clothes he
had slept in "so mussy" he had put on his "other suit," and had
gone out before breakfast with the mussed clothes to have them
pressed, taking his evening things with them. Satisfied with this
explanation, and failing to observe that it did not account for
the absence of shoes from the closet floor, she nodded absently,
"Yes, that must be it"; and, when her mother returned, told her
that Walter had probably breakfasted down-town. They did not delay
over this; the coloured woman had arrived, and the basket's disclosures
were important.</p>

<p>"I stopped at Worlig's on the way back," said Mrs. Adams, flushed
with hurry and excitement. "I bought a can of caviar there. I
thought we'd have little sandwiches brought into the 'living-room'
before dinner, the way you said they did when you went to that
dinner at the&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But I think that was to go with cocktails, mama, and of course
we haven't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. Adams said. "Still, I think it would be nice. We can
make them look very dainty, on a tray, and the waitress can bring
them in. I thought we'd have the soup already on the table; and
we can walk right out as soon as we have the sandwiches, so it
won't get cold. Then, after the soup, Malena says she can make
sweetbread pates with mushrooms: and for the meat course we'll
have larded fillet. Malena's really a fancy cook, you know, and
she says she can do anything like that to perfection. We'll have
peas with the fillet, and potato balls and Brussels sprouts. Brussels
sprouts are fashionable now, they told me at market. Then will
come the chicken salad, and after that the ice-cream&mdash;she's going
to make an angel-food cake to go with it&mdash;and then coffee and
crackers and a new kind of cheese I got at Worlig's, he says is
very fine."</p>

<p>Alice was alarmed. "Don't you think perhaps it's too much, mama?"</p>

<p>"It's better to have too much than too little," her mother said,
cheerfully. "We don't want him to think we're the kind that skimp.
Lord knows we have to enough, though, most of the time! Get the
flowers in water, child. I bought 'em at market because they're
so much cheaper there, but they'll keep fresh and nice. You fix
'em any way you want. Hurry! It's got to be a busy day."</p>

<p>She had bought three dozen little roses. Alice took them and
began to arrange them in vases, keeping the stems separated as
far as possible so that the clumps would look larger. She put
half a dozen in each of three vases in the "living-room," placing
one vase on the table in the center of the room, and one at each
end of the mantelpiece. Then she took the rest of the roses to
the dining-room; but she postponed the arrangement of them until
the table should be set, just before dinner. She was thoughtful;
planning to dry the stems and lay them on the tablecloth like
a vine of roses running in a delicate design, if she found that
the dozen and a half she had left were enough for that. If they
weren't she would arrange them in a vase.</p>

<p>She looked a long time at the little roses in the basin of water,
where she had put them; then she sighed, and went away to heavier
tasks, while her mother worked in the kitchen with Malena. Alice
dusted the "living-room" and the dining-room vigorously, though
all the time with a look that grew more and more pensive; and
having dusted everything, she wiped the furniture; rubbed it hard.
After that, she washed the floors and the woodwork.</p>

<p>Emerging from the kitchen at noon, Mrs. Adams found her daughter
on hands and knees, scrubbing the bases of the columns between
the hall and the "living-room."</p>

<p>"Now, dearie," she said, "you mustn't tire yourself out, and
you'd better come and eat something. Your father said he'd get
a bite down-town to-day&mdash;he was going down to the bank&mdash;and Walter
eats down-town all the time lately, so I thought we wouldn't bother
to set the table for lunch. Come on and we'll have something in
the kitchen."</p>

<p>"No," Alice said, dully, as she went on with the work. "I don't
want anything."</p>

<p>Her mother came closer to her. "Why, what's the matter?" she
asked, briskly. "You seem kind of pale, to me; and you don't look&mdash;you
don't look <em>HAPPY</em>."</p>

<p>"Well&#11834;" Alice began, uncertainly, but said no more.</p>

<p>"See here!" Mrs. Adams exclaimed. "This is all just for you!
You ought to be <em>ENJOYING </em>it. Why, it's the first time
we've&mdash;we've entertained in I don't know how long! I guess it's
almost since we had that little party when you were eighteen.
What's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I don't know."</p>

<p>"But, dearie, aren't you looking <em>FORWARD </em>to this evening?"</p>

<p>The girl looked up, showing a pallid and solemn face. "Oh, yes,
of course," she said, and tried to smile. "Of course we had to
do it &mdash;I do think it'll be nice. Of course I'm looking forward
to it."</p>
