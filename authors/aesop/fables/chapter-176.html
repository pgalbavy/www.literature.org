A WASP seated himself upon the head of a Snake and, striking him
unceasingly with his stings, wounded him to death.  The Snake,
being in great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his
enemy, saw a wagon heavily laden with wood, and went and
purposely placed his head under the wheels, saying, "At least my
enemy and I shall perish together."
