<P>
He was a whiskey-guzzling Scotchman, and he downed his whiskey neat, beginning
with his first tot punctually at six in the morning, and thereafter repeating
it at regular intervals throughout the day till bedtime, which was usually
midnight.  He slept but five hours out of the twenty-four, and for the
remaining nineteen hours he was quietly and decently drunk. During the eight
weeks I spent with him on Oolong Atoll, I never saw him draw a sober breath.
In fact, his sleep was so short that he never had time to sober up. It was the
most beautiful and orderly perennial drunk I have ever observed.
<P>
McAllister was his name. He was an old man, and very shaky on his pins. His
hand trembled as with a palsy, especially noticeable when he poured his
whiskey, though I never knew him to spill a drop. He had been twenty-eight
years in Melanesia, ranging from German New Guinea to the German Solomons, and
so thoroughly had he become identified with that portion of the world, that he
habitually spoke in that bastard lingo called "bech-de-mer." Thus, in
conversation with me, SUN HE COME UP meant sunrise; KAI-KAI HE STOP meant that
dinner was served; and BELLY BELONG ME WALK ABOUT meant that he was sick at
his stomach. He was a small man, and a withered one, burned inside and outside
by ardent spirits and ardent sun. He was a cinder, a bit of a clinker of a
man, a little animated clinker, not yet quite cold, that moved stiffly and by
starts and jerks like an automaton. A gust of wind would have blown him away.
He weighed ninety pounds.
<P>
But the immense thing about him was the power with which he ruled. Oolong
Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference. One steered by compass
course in its lagoon. It was populated by five thousand Polynesians, all
strapping men and women, many of them standing six feet in height and weighing
a couple of hundred pounds. Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the
nearest land.  Twice a year a little schooner called to collect copra. The one
white man on Oolong was McAllister, petty trader and unintermittent guzzler;
and he ruled Oolong and its six thousand savages with an iron hand. He said
come, and they came, go, and they went. They never questioned his will nor
judgment. He was cantankerous as only an aged Scotchman can be, and interfered
continually in their personal affairs. When Nugu, the king's daughter, wanted
to marry Haunau from the other end of the atoll, her father said yes; but
McAllister said no, and the marriage never came off. When the king wanted to
buy a certain islet in the lagoon from the chief priest, McAllister said no.
The king was in debt to the Company to the tune of 180,000 cocoanuts, and
until that was paid he was not to spend a single cocoanut on anything else.
<P>
And yet the king and his people did not love McAllister. In truth, they hated
him horribly, and, to my knowledge, the whole population, with the priests at
the head, tried vainly for three months to pray him to death. The devil-devils
they sent after him were awe-inspiring, but since McAllister did not believe
in devil-devils, they were without power over him. With drunken Scotchmen all
signs fail. They gathered up scraps of food which had touched his lips, an
empty whiskey bottle, a cocoanut from which he had drunk, and even his
spittle, and performed all kinds of deviltries over them. But McAllister lived
on. His health was superb. He never caught fever; nor coughs nor colds;
dysentery passed him by; and the malignant ulcers and vile skin diseases that
attack blacks and whites alike in that climate never fastened upon him. He
must have been so saturated with alcohol as to defy the lodgment of germs. I
used to imagine them falling to the ground in showers of microscopic cinders
as fast as they entered his whiskey-sodden aura. No one loved him, not even
germs, while he loved only whiskey, and still he lived.
<P>
I was puzzled. I could not understand six thousand natives putting up with
that withered shrimp of a tyrant. It was a miracle that he had not died
suddenly long since. Unlike the cowardly Melanesians, the people were
high-stomached and warlike. In the big graveyard, at head and feet of the
graves, were relics of past sanguinary history--blubber-spades, rusty old
bayonets and cutlasses, copper bolts, rudder-irons, harpoons, bomb guns,
bricks that could have come from nowhere but a whaler's trying-out furnace,
and old brass pieces of the sixteenth century that verified the traditions of
the early Spanish navigators. Ship after ship had come to grief on Oolong. Not
thirty years before, the whaler BLENNERDALE, running into the lagoon for
repair, had been cut off with all hands.  In similar fashion had the crew of
the GASKET, a sandalwood trader, perished.  There was a big French bark, the
TOULON, becalmed off the atoll, which the islanders boarded after a sharp
tussle and wrecked in the Lipau Passage, the captain and a handful of sailors
escaping in the longboat. Then there were the Spanish pieces, which told of
the loss of one of the early explorers. All this, of the vessels named, is a
matter of history, and is to be found in the SOUTH PACIFIC SAILING DIRECTORY.
But that there was other history, unwritten, I was yet to learn. In the
meantime I puzzled why six thousand primitive savages let one degenerate
Scotch despot live.
<P>
One hot afternoon McAllister and I sat on the veranda looking out over the
lagoon, with all its wonder of jeweled colors. At our backs, across the
hundred yards of palm-studded sand, the outer surf roared on the reef. It was
dreadfully warm. We were in four degree south latitude and the sun was
directly overhead, having crossed the Line a few days before on its journey
south. There was no wind--not even a catspaw. The season of the southeast
trade was drawing to an early close, and the northwest monsoon had not yet
begun to blow.
<P>
"They can't dance worth a damn," said McAllister.
<P>
I had happened to mention that the Polynesian dances were superior to the
Papuan, and this McAllister had denied, for no other reason than his
cantankerousness.  But it was too not to argue, and I said nothing. Besides, I
had never seen the Oolong people dance.
<P>
"I'll prove it to you," he announced, beckoning to the black New Hanover boy,
a labor recruit, who served as cook and general house servant. "Hey, you, boy,
you tell 'm one fella king come along me."
<P>
The boy departed, and back came the prime minister, perturbed, ill at ease,
and garrulous with apologetic explanation. In short, the king slept, and was
not to be disturbed.
<P>
"King he plenty strong fella sleep," was his final sentence.
<P>
McAllister was in such a rage that the prime minister incontinently fled, to
return with the king himself. They were a magnificent pair, the king
especially, who must have been all of six feet three inches in height. His
features had the eagle-like quality that is so frequently found in those of
the North American Indian. He had been molded and born to rule. His eyes
flashed as he listened, but right meekly he obeyed McAllister's command to
fetch a couple of hundred of the best dancers, male and female, in the
village. And dance they did, for two mortal hours, under that broiling sun.
They did not love him for it, and little he cared, in the end dismissing them
with abuse and sneers.
<P>
The abject servility of those magnificent savages was terrifying. How could it
be? What was the secret of his rule? More and more I puzzled as the days went
by, and though I observed perpetual examples of his undisputed sovereignty,
never a clew was there as to how it was.
<P>
One day I happened to speak of my disappointment in failing to trade for a
beautiful pair of orange cowries. The pair was worth five pounds in Sydney if
it was worth a cent. I had offered two hundred sticks of tobacco to the owner,
who had held out for three hundred. When I casually mentioned the situation,
McAllister immediately sent for the man, took the shells from him, and turned
them over to me. Fifty sticks were all he permitted me to pay for them. The
man accepted the tobacco and seemed overjoyed at getting off so easily. As for
me, I resolved to keep a bridle on my tongue in the future. And still I mulled
over the secret of McAllister's power. I even went to the extent of asking him
directly, but all he did was to cock one eye, look wise, and take another
drink.
<P>
One night I was out fishing in the lagoon with Oti, the man who had been
mulcted of the cowries. Privily, I had made up to him an additional hundred
and fifty sticks, and he had come to regard me with a respect that was almost
veneration, which was curious, seeing that he was an old man, twice my age at
least.
<P>
"What name you fella kanaka all the same pickaninny?" I began on him. "This
fella trader he one fella. You fella kanaka plenty fella too much. You fella
kanaka just like 'm dog--plenty fright along that fella trader. He no eat you,
fella. He no get 'm teeth along him. What name you too much fright?"
<P>
"S'pose plenty fella kanaka kill m?" he asked.
<P>
"He die," I retorted. "You fella kanaka kill 'm plenty fella white man long
time before. What name you fright this fella white man?"
<P>
"Yes, we kill 'm plenty," was his answer. "My word! Any amount! Long time
before. One time, me young fella too much, one big fella ship he stop outside. 
Wind he no blow. Plenty fella kanaka we get 'm canoe, plenty fella canoe, we
go catch 'm that fella ship. My word--we catch 'm big fella fight. Two, three
white men shoot like hell. We no fright. We come alongside, we go up side,
plenty fella, maybe I think fifty-ten (five hundred). One fella white Mary
(woman) belong that fella ship. Never before I see 'm white Mary. Bime by
plenty white man finish. One fella skipper he no die. Five fella, six fella
white man no die. Skipper he sing out. Some fella white man he fight. Some
fella white man he lower away boat. After that, all together over the side
they go. Skipper he sling white Mary down. After that they washee (row) strong
fella plenty too much. Father belong me, that time he strong fella. He throw
'm one fella spear. That fella spear he go in one side that white Mary. He no
stop.  My word, he go out other side that fella Mary. She finish. Me no
fright.  Plenty kanaka too much no fright."
<P>
Old Oti's pride had been touched, for he suddenly stripped down his lava-lava
and showed me the unmistakable scar of a bullet. Before I could speak, his
line ran out suddenly. He checked it and attempted to haul in, but found that
the fish had run around a coral branch. Casting a look of reproach at me for
having beguiled him from his watchfulness, he went over the side, feet first,
turning over after he got under and following his line down to bottom. The
water was ten fathoms. I leaned over and watched the play of his feet, growing
dim and dimmer, as they stirred the wan phosphorescence into ghostly fires.
Ten fathoms--sixty feet--it was nothing to him, an old man, compared with the
value of a hook and line. After what seemed five minutes, though it could not
have been more than a minute, I saw him flaming whitely upward. He broke
surface and dropped a ten pound rock cod into the canoe, the line and hook
intact, the latter still fast in the fish's mouth.
<P>
"It may be," I said remorselessly. "You no fright long ago. You plenty fright
now along that fella trader."
<P>
"Yes, plenty fright," he confessed, with an air of dismissing the subject. For
half an hour we pulled up our lines and flung them out in silence. Then small
fish-sharks began to bite, and after losing a hook apiece, we hauled in and
waited for the sharks to go their way.
<P>
"I speak you true," Oti broke into speech, "then you savve we fright now."
<P>
I lighted up my pipe and waited, and the story that Oti told me in atrocious
bech-de-mer I here turn into proper English. Otherwise, in spirit and order of
narrative, the tale is as it fell from Oti's lips.
<P>
"It was after that that we were very proud. We had fought many times with the
strange white men who live upon the sea, and always we had beaten them. A few
of us were killed, but what was that compared with the stores of wealth of a
thousand thousand kinds that we found on the ships? And then one day, maybe
twenty years ago, or twenty-five, there came a schooner right through the
passage and into the lagoon. It was a large schooner with three masts. She had
five white men and maybe forty boat's crew, black fellows from New Guinea and
New Britain; and she had come to fish beche-de-mer. She lay at anchor across
the lagoon from here, at Pauloo, and her boats scattered out everywhere,
making camps on the beaches where they cured the beche-de-mer. This made them
weak by dividing them, for those who fished here and those on the schooner at
Pauloo were fifty miles apart, and there were others farther away still.
<P>
"Our king and headmen held council, and I was one in the canoe that paddled
all afternoon and all night across the lagoon, bringing word to the people of
Pauloo that in the morning we would attack the fishing camps at the one time
and that it was for them to take the schooner. We who brought the word were
tired with the paddling, but we took part in the attack. On the schooner were
two white men, the skipper and the second mate, with half a dozen black boys.
The skipper with three boys we caught on shore and killed, but first eight of
us the skipper killed with his two revolvers. We fought close together, you
see, at hand grapples.
<P>
"The noise of our fighting told the mate what was happening, and he put food
and water and a sail in the small dingy, which was so small that it was no
more than twelve feet long. We came down upon the schooner, a thousand men,
covering the lagoon with our canoes. Also, we were blowing conch shells,
singing war songs, and striking the sides of the canoes with our paddles. What
chance had one white man and three black boys against us? No chance at all,
and the mate knew it.
<P>
"White men are hell. I have watched them much, and I am an old man now, and I
understand at last why the white men have taken to themselves all the islands
in the sea. It is because they are hell. Here are you in the canoe with me.
You are hardly more than a boy. You are not wise, for each day I tell you many
things you do not know. When I was a little pickaninny, I knew more about fish
and the ways of fish than you know now. I am an old man, but I swim down to
the bottom of the lagoon, and you cannot follow me. What are you good for,
anyway?  I do not know, except to fight. I have never seen you fight, yet I
know that you are like your brothers and that you will fight like hell. Also,
you are a fool, like your brothers. You do not know when you are beaten. You
will fight until you die, and then it will be too late to know that you are
beaten.
<P>
"Now behold what this mate did. As we came down upon him, covering the sea and
blowing our conches, he put off from the schooner in the small boat, along
with the three black boys, and rowed for the passage. There again he was a
fool, for no wise man would put out to sea in so small a boat. The sides of it
were not four inches above the water. Twenty canoes went after him, filled
with two hundred young men. We paddled five fathoms while his black boys were
rowing one fathom. He had no chance, but he was a fool. He stood up in the
boat with a rifle, and he shot many times. He was not a good shot, but as we
drew close many of us were wounded and killed. But still he had no chance.
<P>
"I remember that all the time he was smoking a cigar. When we were forty feet
away and coming fast, he dropped the rifle, lighted a stick of dynamite with
the cigar, and threw it at us. He lighted another and another, and threw them
at us very rapidly, many of them. I know now that he must have split the ends
of the fuses and stuck in match heads, because they lighted so quickly. Also,
the fuses were very short. Sometimes the dynamite sticks went off in the air,
but most of them went off in the canoes. And each time they went off in a
canoe, that canoe was finished. Of the twenty canoes, the half were smashed to
pieces. The canoe I was in was so smashed, and likewise the two men who sat
next to me. The dynamite fell between them. The other canoes turned and ran
away. Then that mate yelled, Yah! Yah! Yah!' at us. Also he went at us again
with his rifle, so that many were killed through the back as they fled away.
And all the time the black boys in the boat went on rowing. You see, I told
you true, that mate was hell.
<P>
"Nor was that all. Before he left the schooner, he set her on fire, and fixed
up all the powder and dynamite so that it would go off at one time. There were
hundreds of us on board, trying to put out the fire, heaving up water from
overside, when the schooner blew up. So that all we had fought for was lost to
us, besides many more of us being killed. Sometimes, even now, in my old age,
I have bad dreams in which I hear that mate yell, Yah! Yah! Yah!' In a voice
of thunder he yells, Yah! Yah! Yah!' But all those in the fishing camps were
killed.
<P>
"The mate went out of the passage in his little boat, and that was the end of
him we made sure, for how could so small a boat, with four men in it, live on
the ocean? A month went by, and then, one morning, between two rain squalls, a
schooner sailed in through our passage and dropped anchor before the village. 
The king and the headmen made big talk, and it was agreed that we would take
the schooner in two or three days. In the meantime, as it was our custom
always to appear friendly, we went off to her in canoes, bringing strings of
cocoanuts, fowls, and pigs, to trade. But when we were alongside, many canoes
of us, the men on board began to shoot us with rifles, and as we paddled away
I saw the mate who had gone to sea in the little boat spring upon the rail and
dance and yell,  Yah! Yah! Yah!'
<P>
"That afternoon they landed from the schooner in three small boats filled with
white men. They went right through the village, shooting every man they saw. 
Also they shot the fowls and pigs. We who were not killed got away in canoes
and paddled out into the lagoon. Looking back, we could see all the houses on
fire.  Late in the afternoon we saw many canoes coming from Nihi, which is the
village near the Nihi Passage in the northeast. They were all that were left,
and like us their village had been burned by a second schooner that had come
through Nihi Passage.
<P>
"We stood on in the darkness to the westward for Pauloo, but in the middle of
the night we heard women wailing and then we ran into a big fleet of canoes.
They were all that were left of Pauloo, which likewise was in ashes, for a
third schooner had come in through the Pauloo Passage. You see, that mate,
with his black boys, had not been drowned. He had made the Solomon Islands,
and there told his brothers of what we had done in Oolong. And all his
brothers had said they would come and punish us, and there they were in the
three schooners, and our three villages were wiped out.
<P>
"And what was there for us to do? In the morning the two schooners from
windward sailed down upon us in the middle of the lagoon. The trade wind was
blowing fresh, and by scores of canoes they ran us down. And the rifles never
ceased talking. We scattered like flying fish before the bonita, and there
were so many of us that we escaped by thousands, this way and that, to the
islands on the rim of the atoll.
<P>
"And thereafter the schooners hunted us up and down the lagoon. In the
nighttime we slipped past them. But the next day, or in two days or three
days, the schooners would be coming back, hunting us toward the other end of
the lagoon.  And so it went. We no longer counted nor remembered our dead.
True, we were many and they were few. But what could we do? I was in one of
the twenty canoes filled with men who were not afraid to die. We attacked the
smallest schooner.  They shot us down in heaps. They threw dynamite into the
canoes, and when the dynamite gave out, they threw hot water down upon us. And
the rifles never ceased talking. And those whose canoes were smashed were shot
as they swam away.  And the mate danced up and down upon the cabin top and
yelled, "Yah! Yah! Yah!'
<P>
"Every house on every smallest island was burned. Not a pig nor a fowl was
left alive. Our wells were defiled with the bodies of the slain, or else
heaped high with coral rock. We were twenty-five thousand on Oolong before the
three schooners came. Today we are five thousand. After the schooners left, we
were but three thousand, as you shall see.
<P>
"At last the three schooners grew tired of chasing us back and forth. So they
went, the three of them, to Nihi, in the northeast. And then they drove us
steadily to the west. Their nine boats were in the water as well. They beat up
every island as they moved along. They drove us, drove us, drove us day by
day.  And every night the three schooners and the nine boats made a chain of
watchfulness that stretched across the lagoon from rim to rim, so that we
could not escape back.
<P>
"They could not drive us forever that way, for the lagoon was only so large,
and at last all of us that yet lived were driven upon the last sand bank to
the west.  Beyond lay the open sea. There were ten thousand of us, and we
covered the sand bank from the lagoon edge to the pounding surf on the other
side. No one could lie down. There was no room. We stood hip to hip and
shoulder to shoulder. Two days they kept us there, and the mate would climb up
in the rigging to mock us and yell, Yah! Yah! Yah!' till we were well sorry
that we had ever harmed him or his schooner a month before. We had no food,
and we stood on our feet two days and nights. The little babies died, and the
old and weak died, and the wounded died. And worst of all, we had no water to
quench our thirst, and for two days the sun beat down on us, and there was no
shade. Many men and women waded out into the ocean and were drowned, the surf
casting their bodies back on the beach. And there came a pest of flies. Some
men swam to the sides of the schooners, but they were shot to the last one.
And we that lived were very sorry that in our pride we tried to take the
schooner with the three masts that came to fish for beche-de-mer.
<P>
"On the morning of the third day came the skippers of the three schooners and
that mate in a small boat. They carried rifles, all of them, and revolvers,
and they made talk. It was only that they were weary of killing us that they
had stopped, they told us. And we told them that we were sorry, that never
again would we harm a white man, and in token of our submission we poured sand
upon our heads. And all the women and children set up a great wailing for
water, so that for some time no man could make himself heard. Then we were
told our punishment.  We must fill the three schooners with copra and
beche-de-mer. And we agreed, for we wanted water, and our hearts were broken,
and we knew that we were children at fighting when we fought with white men
who fight like hell. And when all the talk was finished, the mate stood up and
mocked us, and yelled, Yah! Yah!  Yah!' After that we paddled away in our
canoes and sought water.
<P>
"And for weeks we toiled at catching beche-de-mer and curing it, in gathering
the cocoanuts and turning them into copra. By day and night the smoke rose in
clouds from all the beaches of all the islands of Oolong as we paid the
penalty of our wrongdoing. For in those days of death it was burned clearly on
all our brains that it was very wrong to harm a white man.
<P>
"By and by, the schooners full of copra and beche-de-mer and our trees empty
of cocoanuts, the three skippers and that mate called us all together for a
big talk. And they said they were very glad that we had learned our lesson,
and we said for the ten-thousandth time that we were sorry and that we would
not do it again. Also, we poured sand upon our heads. Then the skippers said
that it was all very well, but just to show us that they did not forget us,
they would send a devil-devil that we would never forget and that we would
always remember any time we might feel like harming a white man. After that
the mate mocked us one more time and yelled, Yah! Yah! Yah!' Then six of our
men, whom we thought long dead, were put ashore from one of the schooners, and
the schooners hoisted their sails and ran out through the passage for the
Solomons.
<P>
"The six men who were put ashore were the first to catch the devil-devil the
skippers sent back after us."
<P>
"A great sickness came," I interrupted, for I recognized the trick. The
schooner had had measles on board, and the six prisoners had been deliberately
exposed to it.
<P>
"Yes, a great sickness," Oti went on. "It was a powerful devil-devil. The
oldest man had never heard of the like. Those of our priests that yet lived we
killed because they could not overcome the devil-devil. The sickness spread. 
I have said that there were ten thousand of us that stood hip to hip and
shoulder to shoulder on the sandbank. When the sickness left us, there were
three thousand yet alive. Also, having made all our cocoanuts into copra,
there was a famine.
<P>
"That fella trader," Oti concluded, "he like 'm that much dirt. He like 'm
clam he die KAI-KAI (meat) he stop, stink 'm any amount. He like 'm one fella
dog, one sick fella dog plenty fleas stop along him. We no fright along that
fella trader. We fright because he white man. We savve plenty too much no good
kill white man. That one fella sick dog trader he plenty brother stop along
him, white men like 'm you fight like hell. We no fright that damn trader.
Some time he made kanaka plenty cross along him and kanaka want 'm kill m,
kanaka he think devil-devil and kanaka he hear that fella mate sing out, Yah!
Yah! Yah!' and kanaka no kill m."
<P>
Oti baited his hook with a piece of squid, which he tore with his teeth from
the live and squirming monster, and hook and bait sank in white flames to the
bottom.
<P>
"Shark walk about he finish," he said. "I think we catch 'm plenty fella
fish."
<P>
His line jerked savagely. He pulled it in rapidly, hand under hand, and landed
a big gasping rock cod in the bottom of the canoe.
<P>
"Sun he come up, I make 'm that dam fella trader one present big fella fish,"
said Oti.
