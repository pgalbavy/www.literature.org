<p>Could you have seen the hunter with the terrible gun and Lightfoot
the Deer that morning on which the hunting season opened you might
have thought that Lightfoot was hunting the hunter instead of
the hunter hunting Lightfoot. You see, Lightfoot was behind the
hunter instead of in front of him. He was following the hunter,
so as to keep track of him. As long as he knew just where the
hunter was, he felt reasonably safe.</p>

<p>The Merry Little Breezes are Lightfoot's best friends. They always
bring to him all the different scents they find as they wander
through the Green Forest. And Lightfoot's delicate nose is so
wonderful that he can take these scents, even though they be very
faint, and tell just who or what has made them. So, though he
makes the best possible use of his big ears and his beautiful
eyes, he trusts more to his nose to warn him of danger. For this
reason, during the hunting season when he moves about, he moves
in the direction from which the Merry Little Breezes may be blowing.
He knows that they will bring to him warning of any danger which
may lie in that direction.</p>

<p>Now the hunter with the terrible gun who was looking for Lightfoot
knew all this, for he was wise in the ways of Lightfoot and of
the other little people of the Green Forest. When he had entered
the Green Forest that morning he had first of all made sure of
the direction from which the Merry Little Breezes were coming.
Then he had begun to hunt in that direction, knowing that thus
his scent would be carried behind him. It is more than likely
that he would have reached the hiding-place of Lightfoot the Deer
before the latter would have known that he was in the Green Forest,
had it not been for Sammy Jay's warning.</p>

<p>When he reached the tangle of fallen trees behind which Lightfoot
had been hiding, he worked around it slowly and with the greatest
care, holding his terrible gun ready to use instantly should Lightfoot
leap out. Presently he found Lightfoot's footprints in the soft
ground and studying them he knew that Lightfoot had known of his
coming.</p>

<p>"It was that confounded Jay," muttered the hunter. "Lightfoot
heard him and knew what it meant. I know what he has done; he
has circled round so as to get behind me and get my scent. It
is a clever trick, a very clever trick, but two can play at that
game. I'll just try that little trick myself."</p>

<p>So the hunter in his turn made a wide circle back, and presently
there was none of the dreaded man-smell among the scents which
the Merry Little Breezes brought to Lightfoot. Lightfoot had lost
track of the hunter.</p>
