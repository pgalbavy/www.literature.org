<p>Bombardment of Tripoli&mdash;Treacherous Act of a Turkish Captain
&mdash;A Quick Retribution at the Hands of Captain Decatur.</p>

<p>The Bashaw of Tripoli was not yet subdued. He treated his American
prisoners with greater harshness and refused to believe their
nation was strong enough to bring him to terms.</p>

<p>On August 3, Commodore (as the senior officer of every squadron
was then called) Preble sailed into the harbor of Tripoli with
his fleet and opened the bombardment of the city. At the same
time, several of his gunboats engaged those of the enemy. Lieutenant
James Decatur, brother of Stephen, made chase of a Tripolitan
vessel, reserving his fire until the two almost touched, when
he poured in such a destructive discharge of musketry and grape
that the terrified enemy surrendered. Lieutenant Decatur sprang
aboard of his prize, when, at that instant, the Turkish commander,
a man of massive strength and build, fired his pistol in the American
officer's face and killed him. In the confusion caused by this
treacherous act the enemy's boat got away and started for the
city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain Decatur had been doing characteristic work.
With three gunboats he attacked a force three times as numerous
as his own. Impetuously boarding the first craft, after a discharge
from his long boat, he engaged the numerous crew in a furious
hand-to-hand struggle, in which all were made prisoners or forced
to leap into the sea to save themselves. Then Decatur began towing
away his prize, when he was told of the murder of his brother.</p>

<p>The grief-stricken and enraged captain instantly cast his prize
adrift and started after the "unspeakable Turk." The boat was
easily recognized, and, delivering a destructive fire, the pursuer
ran alongside and the Americans rushed aboard, with Decatur in
the lead. The enormous size and gorgeous uniform of the Turkish
captain made him so conspicuous that Decatur knew him at once,
and, rushing forward, lunged at him with his boarding pike. The
Turk must have felt contempt for the American who dared thus to
assail him, for his assailant was but a boy in size compared to
him. He speedily proved his physical superiority over Decatur,
for he not only parried the lunge of the pike, but wrenched it
from his hand. He in turn drove his pike at Decatur's breast,
but his blow was also parried, though its violence broke off the
American's sword at the hilt. The active Turk came again, and
his second blow was only partly turned aside, the point of the
pike tearing through Decatur's coat and inflicting a bad wound
in his chest.</p>

<p>Before the Turk could strike a third time, Decatur ran in, and
the two instantly engaged in a fierce wrestling bout. The American
was the most skilful, but by sheer strength his enormous antagonist
threw him to the deck, and, gripping him by the throat with one
hand, he reached down to draw a small curved knife, known as a
yataghan. It was behind the sash in his waist and directly in
front. Decatur threw both legs over the back of the Turk and pressed
him so close that he could not force his hand between their bodies
to reach his weapon. Decatur's pistol was at his hip. He was able
to withdraw it, and he then did the only thing that could possibly
save his life, though the chances were that the act would hasten
his death.</p>

<p>Reaching over the back of the Turk, he pointed the weapon downward
toward his own breast and pulled the trigger. In most cases the
bullet would have passed through both bodies, but, fortunately,
the ball encountered some obstruction and did not reach the imperiled
American. He shoved off the bulky form, which rolled over on its
back, dead.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that while this furious hand-to-hand
encounter was under way the respective crews were idle. They,
too, were fighting fiercely, and, closing about the struggling
commanders, each side endeavored to help its own. The crowd surged
back and forth and became mixed in inextricable confusion. One
of the Turks saw a chance to help his captain and made a vicious
blow at his opponent with his scimiter. Reuben James, a sailor,
who was so wounded in his arms that he could not use them, thrust
his head forward and received the stroke upon his skull. The wound
was a frightful one, but, beyond dispute, it saved the life of
Decatur, who never forgot the man that had done him this inestimable
service.</p>

<p>Reuben James was one of the volunteers who helped Decatur destroy
the <em>Philadelphia</em>. He recovered from his terrible wound
and did excellent service in the war of 1812. In one battle he
was three times wounded before he would allow his comrades to
carry him below. He lived fully twenty years after the death of
his beloved commander, dying at a good old age, though he was
scarred with sabre cuts, wounded times innumerable by bullets,
and compelled to suffer the amputation of a leg.</p>

<p>The bombardment of Tripoli was less successful than expected.
The shells were of such poor quality that no impression was made
on the defences. All naval operations have proven that, as a rule,
ships are comparatively powerless for aggressive work against
forts and batteries on shore.</p>

<p>An investigation into the cause of the failure of so many shells
sent into Tripoli brought out several interesting facts. Captain
Bainbridge, who carefully noted the results of the bombardment
while a prisoner in the city, stated that out of forty-eight thrown
on one day only one exploded. It was found that the fuses in many
of the bombs had been choked by lead that was poured into them.
This was probably done by French agents in Sicily.</p>

<p>At the beginning of hostilities, the Tripolitans placed great
reliance upon their ability to fight at close quarters. Undeniably,
they did better in such position than in handling their ships.
They had all the viciousness of wild cats, and it has been shown
how fiercely they fought in hand-to-hand encounters; but their
experience with the Americans taught them that they were to be
dreaded in any situation where their anger was aroused, and, as
a consequence, the Turks became less eager for tests of individual
strength, skill and bravery.</p>
