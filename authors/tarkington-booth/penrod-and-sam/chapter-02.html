<p>After such rigorous events, every one comprehended that the game
of bonded prisoner was over, and there was no suggestion that
it should or might be resumed. The fashion of its conclusion had
been so consummately enjoyed by all parties (with the natural
exception of Roddy Bitts) that a renewal would have been tame;
hence, the various minds of the company turned to other matters
and became restless. Georgie Bassett withdrew first, remembering
that if he expected to be as wonderful as usual, to-morrow, in
Sunday-school, it was time to prepare himself, though this was
not included in the statement he made alleging the cause of his
departure. Being detained bodily and pressed for explanation,
he desperately said that he had to go home to tease the cook&mdash;which
had the rakehelly air he thought would insure his release, but
was not considered plausible. However, he was finally allowed
to go, and, as first hints of evening were already cooling and
darkening the air, the party broke up, its members setting forth,
whistling, toward their several homes, though Penrod lingered
with Sam. Herman was the last to go from them.</p>

<p>"Well, I got git 'at stove-wood f' suppuh," he said, rising and
stretching himself. "I got git 'at lil' soap-box wagon, an' go
on ovuh wheres 'at new house buil'in' on Secon' Street; pick up
few shingles an' blocks layin' roun'."</p>

<p>He went through the yard toward the alley, and, at the alley
gate, remembering something, he paused and called to them. The
lot was a deep one, and they were too far away to catch his meaning.
Sam shouted, "Can't <em>HEAR </em>you!" and Herman replied, but
still unintelligibly; then, upon Sam's repetition of "Can't <em>HEAR
</em>you!" Herman waved his arm in farewell, implying that the
matter was of little significance, and vanished. But if they had
understood him, Penrod and Sam might have considered his inquiry
of instant importance, for Herman's last shout was to ask if either
of them had noticed "where Verman went."</p>

<p>Verman and Verman's whereabouts were, at this hour, of no more
concern to Sam and Penrod than was the other side of the moon.
That unfortunate bonded prisoner had been long since utterly effaced
from their fields of consciousness, and the dark secret of their
Bastille troubled them not&mdash;for the main and simple reason that
they had forgotten it.</p>

<p>They drifted indoors, and found Sam's mother's white cat drowsing
on a desk in the library, the which coincidence obviously inspired
the experiment of ascertaining how successfully ink could be used
in making a clean white cat look like a coach-dog. There was neither
malice nor mischief in their idea; simply, a problem presented
itself to the biological and artistic questionings beginning to
stir within them. They did not mean to do the cat the slightest
injury or to cause her any pain. They were above teasing cats,
and they merely detained this one and made her feel a little wet&mdash;at
considerable cost to themselves from both the ink and the cat.
However, at the conclusion of their efforts, it was thought safer
to drop the cat out of the window before anybody came, and, after
some hasty work with blotters, the desk was moved to cover certain
sections of the rug, and the two boys repaired to the bathroom
for hot water and soap. They knew they had done nothing wrong;
but they felt easier when the only traces remaining upon them
were the less prominent ones upon their garments.</p>

<p>These precautions taken, it was time for them to make their appearance
at Penrod's house for dinner, for it had been arranged, upon petition
earlier in the day, that Sam should be his friend's guest for
the evening meal. Clean to the elbows and with light hearts, they
set forth. They marched, whistling&mdash;though not producing a distinctly
musical effect, since neither had any particular air in mind&mdash;and
they found nothing wrong with the world; they had not a care.
Arrived at their adjacent destination, they found Miss Margaret
Schofield just entering the front door.</p>

<p>"Hurry, boys!" she said. "Mamma came home long before I did,
and I'm sure dinner is waiting. Run on out to the dining-room
and tell them I'll be right down."</p>

<p>And, as they obeyed, she mounted the stairs, humming a little
tune and unfastening the clasp of the long, light-blue military
cape she wore. She went to her own quiet room, lit the gas, removed
her hat and placed it and the cape upon the bed; after which she
gave her hair a push, subsequent to her scrutiny of a mirror;
then, turning out the light, she went as far as the door. Being
an orderly girl, she returned to the bed and took the cape and
the hat to her clothes-closet. She opened the door of this sanctuary,
and, in the dark, hung her cape upon a hook and placed her hat
upon the shelf. Then she closed the door again, having noted nothing
unusual, though she had an impression that the place needed airing.
She descended to the dinner table.</p>

<p>The other members of the family were already occupied with the
meal, and the visitor was replying politely, in his non-masticatory
intervals, to inquiries concerning the health of his relatives.
So sweet and assured was the condition of Sam and Penrod that
Margaret's arrival from her room meant nothing to them. Their
memories were not stirred, and they continued eating, their expressions
brightly placid.</p>

<p>But from out of doors there came the sound of a calling and questing
voice, at first in the distance, then growing louder&mdash;coming nearer.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ver-er-man! O-o-o-oh, Ver-er-ma-a-an!"</p>

<p>It was the voice of Herman.</p>

<p>"<em>OO-O-O-O-OH, VER-ER-ER-MA-A-A-AN</em>!"</p>

<p>And then two boys sat stricken at that cheerful table and ceased
to eat. Recollection awoke with a bang!</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" Sam gasped.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Mr. Schofield said. "Swallow something the
wrong way, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, sir."</p>

<p>"<em>OO-O-O-O-OH, VER-ER-ER-MA-A-A-AN</em>!"</p>

<p>And now the voice was near the windows of the dining-room.</p>

<p>Penrod, very pale, pushed back his chair and jumped up.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with <em>YOU?" </em>his father demanded. "Sit
down!"</p>

<p>"It's Herman&mdash;that coloured boy lives in the alley," Penrod said
hoarsely. "I expect &mdash;I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I think his little brother's maybe got lost, and Sam and I better
go help look&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," Mr. Schofield said sharply.
"Sit down and eat your dinner."</p>

<p>In a palsy, the miserable boy resumed his seat. He and Sam exchanged
a single dumb glance; then the eyes of both swung fearfully to
Margaret. Her appearance was one of sprightly content, and, from
a certain point of view, nothing could have been more alarming.
If she had opened her closet door without discovering Verman,
that must have been because Verman was dead and Margaret had failed
to notice the body. (Such were the thoughts of Penrod and Sam.)
But she might not have opened the closet door. And whether she
had or not, Verman must still be there, alive or dead, for if
he had escaped he would have gone home, and their ears would not
be ringing with the sinister and melancholy cry that now came
from the distance, "Oo-o-oh, Ver-er-ma-an!"</p>

<p>Verman, in his seclusion, did not hear that appeal from his brother;
there were too many walls between them. But he was becoming impatient
for release, though, all in all, he had not found the confinement
intolerable or even very irksome. His character was philosophic,
his imagination calm; no bugaboos came to trouble him. When the
boys closed the door upon him, he made himself comfortable upon
the floor and, for a time, thoughtfully chewed a patent-leather
slipper that had come under his hand. He found the patent leather
not unpleasant to his palate, though he swallowed only a portion
of what he detached, not being hungry at that time. The soul-fabric
of Verman was of a fortunate weave; he was not a seeker and questioner.
When it happened to him that he was at rest in a shady corner,
he did not even think about a place in the sun. Verman took life
as it came.</p>

<p>Naturally, he fell asleep. And toward the conclusion of his slumbers,
he had this singular adventure: a lady set her foot down within
less than half an inch of his nose&mdash;and neither of them knew it.
Verman slept on, without being wakened by either the closing or
the opening of the door. What did rouse him was something ample
and soft falling upon him &mdash;Margaret's cape, which slid from
the hook after she had gone.</p>

<p>Enveloped in its folds, Verman sat up, corkscrewing his knuckles
into the corners of his eyes. Slowly he became aware of two important
vacuums&mdash;one in time and one in his stomach. Hours had vanished
strangely into nowhere; the game of bonded prisoner was something
cloudy and remote of the long, long ago, and, although Verman
knew where he was, he had partially forgotten how he came there.
He perceived, however, that something had gone wrong, for he was
certain that he ought not to be where he found himself.</p>

<p><em>WHITE-FOLKS' HOUSE! </em>The fact that Verman could not have
pronounced these words rendered them no less clear in his mind;
they began to stir his apprehension, and nothing becomes more
rapidly tumultuous than apprehension once it is stirred. That
he might possibly obtain release by making a noise was too daring
a thought and not even conceived, much less entertained, by the
little and humble Verman. For, with the bewildering gap of his
slumber between him and previous events, he did not place the
responsibility for his being in White-Folks' House upon the white
folks who had put him there. His state of mind was that of the
stable-puppy who knows he <em>MUST </em>not be found in the parlour.
Not thrice in his life had Verman been within the doors of White-Folks'
House, and, above all things, he felt that it was in some undefined
way vital to him to get out of White-Folks' House unobserved and
unknown. It was in his very blood to be sure of that.</p>

<p>Further than this point, the processes of Verman's mind become
mysterious to the observer. It appears, however, that he had a
definite (though somewhat primitive) conception of the usefulness
of disguise; and he must have begun his preparations before he
heard footsteps in the room outside his closed door.</p>

<p>These footsteps were Margaret's. Just as Mr. Schofield's coffee
was brought, and just after Penrod had been baffled in another
attempt to leave the table, Margaret rose and patted her father
impertinently upon the head.</p>

<p>"You can't bully ME that way!" she said. "I got home too late
to dress, and I'm going to a dance. 'Scuse!"</p>

<p>And she began her dancing on the spot, pirouetting herself swiftly
out of the room, and was immediately heard running up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Penrod!" Mr. Schofield shouted. "Sit down! How many times am
I going to tell you? What IS the matter with you to-night?"</p>

<p>"I <em>GOT </em>to go," Penrod gasped. "I got to tell Margaret
sumpthing."</p>

<p>"What have you 'got' to tell her?"</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's sumpthing I forgot to tell her."</p>

<p>"Well, it will keep till she comes downstairs," Mr. Schofield
said grimly. "You sit down till this meal is finished."</p>

<p>Penrod was becoming frantic.</p>

<p>"I got to tell her&mdash;it's sumpthing Sam's mother told me to tell
her,"  he babbled. "Didn't she, Sam? You heard her tell me to
tell her; didn't you, Sam?"</p>

<p>Sam offered prompt corroboration.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; she did. She said for us both to tell her. I better
go, too, I guess, because she said&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted. Startlingly upon their ears rang shriek on
shriek. Mrs. Schofield, recognizing Margaret's voice, likewise
shrieked, and Mr. Schofield uttered various sounds; but Penrod
and Sam were incapable of doing anything vocally. All rushed from
the table.</p>

<p>Margaret continued to shriek, and it is not to be denied that
there was some cause for her agitation. When she opened the closet
door, her light-blue military cape, instead of hanging on the
hook where she had left it, came out into the room in a manner
that she afterward described as "a kind of horrible creep, but
faster than a creep." Nothing was to be seen except the creeping
cape, she said, but, of course, she could tell there was some
awful thing inside of it. It was too large to be a cat, and too
small to be a boy; it was too large to be Duke, Penrod's little
old dog, and, besides, Duke wouldn't act like that. It crept rapidly
out into the upper hall, and then, as she recovered the use of
her voice and began to scream, the animated cape abandoned its
creeping for a quicker gait&mdash;"a weird, heaving flop," she defined
it.</p>

<p>The Thing then decided upon a third style of locomotion, evidently,
for when Sam and Penrod reached the front hall, a few steps in
advance of Mr. and Mrs. Schofield, it was rolling grandly down
the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Schofield had only a hurried glimpse of it as it reached
the bottom, close by the front door.</p>

<p>"Grab that thing!" he shouted, dashing forward. "Stop it! Hit
it!"</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Sam Williams displayed the presence
of mind that was his most eminent characteristic. Sam's wonderful
instinct for the right action almost never failed him in a crisis,
and it did not fail him now. Leaping to the door, at the very
instant when the rolling cape touched it, Sam flung the door open&mdash;and
the cape rolled on. With incredible rapidity and intelligence,
it rolled, indeed, out into the night.</p>

<p>Penrod jumped after it, and the next second reappeared in the
doorway holding the cape. He shook out its folds, breathing hard
but acquiring confidence. In fact, he was able to look up in his
father's face and say, with bright ingenuousness:</p>

<p>"It was just laying there. Do you know what I think? Well, it
couldn't have acted that way itself. I think there must have been
sumpthing kind of inside of it!"</p>

<p>Mr. Schofield shook his head slowly, in marvelling admiration.</p>

<p>"Brilliant&mdash;oh, brilliant!" he murmured, while Mrs. Schofield
ran to support the enfeebled form of Margaret at the top of the
stairs.</p>

<p>... In the library, after Margaret's departure to her dance,
Mr. and Mrs. Schofield were still discussing the visitation, Penrod
having accompanied his homeward-bound guest as far as the front
gate.</p>

<p>"No; you're wrong," Mrs. Schofield said, upholding a theory,
earlier developed by Margaret, that the animated behaviour of
the cape could be satisfactorily explained on no other ground
than the supernatural. "You see, the boys saying they couldn't
remember what Mrs. Williams wanted them to tell Margaret, and
that probably she hadn't told them anything to tell her, because
most likely they'd misunderstood something she said&mdash;well, of
course, all that does sound mixed-up and peculiar; but they sound
that way about half the time, anyhow. No; it couldn't possibly
have had a thing to do with it. They were right there at the table
with us all the time, and they came straight to the table the
minute they entered the house. Before that, they'd been over at
Sam's all afternoon. So, it <em>COULDN'T </em>have been the boys."
Mrs. Schofield paused to ruminate with a little air of pride;
then added: "Margaret has often thought&mdash;oh, long before this!&mdash;that
she was a medium. I mean&mdash;if she would let her self. So it wasn't
anything the boys did."</p>

<p>Mr. Schofield grunted.</p>

<p>"I'll admit this much," he said. "I'll admit it wasn't anything
we'll ever get out of 'em."</p>

<p>And the remarks of Sam and Penrod, taking leave of each other,
one on each side of the gate, appeared to corroborate Mr. Schofield's
opinion.</p>

<p>"Well, g'-night, Penrod," Sam said. "It was a pretty good Saturday,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Fine!" said Penrod casually. "G'-night, Sam."</p>
