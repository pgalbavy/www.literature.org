<p>The attempt to rob the safe in the Beartown post office was accompanied
by more than one unique incident. Chief among these was the cowardice
exhibited by two of the three members who composed the little
band of lawbreakers.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the full-grown man with a big mustache
acted as a lookout at the front, which is perhaps the safest post
for a criminal in such circumstances, since he has a good chance
to get away on the first approach of danger. A second lookout
was placed at the rear. After-developments showed that the trio
was headed by Kit Woodford, the adult member, who had led a life
of crime since boyhood and had served a term in prison. He would
have been more successful as a criminal except for his rank cowardice
which caused him to be despised and cast out by several gangs
with which he sought to connect himself.</p>

<p>The other two burglars were Orestes Noxon and Graff Miller, neither
of whom had reached his majority by more than two years. It was
Miller who took his station at the rear, where on the first sign
of something amiss he sneaked off without giving the signal which
would have warned Noxon in time to flee unharmed. In his way,
he was as lacking in personal courage as Kit Woodford. The latter
held his place until the racket caused by Mike Murphy's tumble
downstairs apprised him that things were not going right. He ventured
upon a single timid whistle, which no one else heard, and then
slunk down the road, hugging the shadows and intent only on saving
his own bacon.</p>

<p>How was it that young Noxon was assigned the most perilous task
of all, when in reality he was the youngest of the three? It was
due to a peculiar skill which neither of the others possessed.
He proved more than once that he could take position in front
of an ordinary safe&mdash;not the most modern kind&mdash;and by a wonderfully
deft manipulation of the knob which governed the combination tell
by the fall of the tumblers just when the index struck the right
numerals. He demonstrated this power many times when all others
who made the trial failed. He asked simply to be left undisturbed
with his ear against the steel door as he turned the knob with
infinite delicacy. He was proud of his ability in this respect,
and when Kit Woodford gave him the post of peril he accepted it
as a compliment and eagerly essayed the task.</p>

<p>Although there is no evidence on the point, it is quite sure
that Kit Woodford, whose chief business was to spy out the land,
knew that several wealthy citizens of Beartown made a practice
of leaving large deposits with Mrs. Friestone overnight or for
several nights and days. It is not to be supposed that Woodford
would rob so insignificant a post office for the small booty that
belonged to the government. Quite likely he was aware of the large
sum left with her on the afternoon before.</p>

<p>But Mike Murphy's original style of descending the back stairs
brought the schemes of the criminals to naught, and saved the
safe from spoliation. I have told how the three criminals scattered
to as many different points of the compass. They could not have
come together again had not previous provision been made for such
emergencies. The leader, having shaken himself clear of the village,
turned into the wood and picked his way toward the river. He was
to the north, however, while the other lookout, Miller, was to
the south, and neither knew how far apart they were.</p>

<p>There seemed little risk in signalling, and after Woodford had
gone half way to the river he paused among the shadows and listened.
He had been startled by the report of the gun, but everything
was now still. Placing his thumb and forefinger between his lips,
he emitted a sharp, tremulous whistle, which was instantly answered
by a similar call from some point not far off. A few minutes later
he and Miller, after a few precautions, came together among the
shadows.</p>

<p>"I knew you would be somewhere in the neighborhood," was the
young man's explanation, "and I was listening for your signal."</p>

<p>"Well," growled the elder, "Noxon made a mess of it to-night."</p>

<p>"It looks that way."</p>

<p>"Do you know what happened? Did you see anything?"</p>

<p>"I saw him dash out from the rear of that store with someone
chasing him with a loaded gun."</p>

<p>"That must have been what we heard a little while ago. Looks
as if they got Nox."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't be surprised," remarked the other indifferently.</p>

<p>"He oughter managed things better. How was it you didn't warn
him?"</p>

<p>"I did; I whistled twice the instant I saw his danger, and ran
the risk of getting it in the neck myself," was the unblushing
response of the youth.</p>

<p>"I don't see that there's anything we can do for him. He got
himself in a hole through his own foolishness and must pull himself
out. My motto when a gang gets into trouble is that every one
must look out for himself and the devil take the hindmost."</p>

<p>"I say, Kit," said Miller, lowering his voice as if fearful of
being overheard, "do you think they'll get Nox?"</p>

<p>"Haven't a doubt of it."</p>

<p>"I say, do you think there's any danger of his squealing, that
is, if he hasn't been killed?"</p>

<p>"Naw," was the disgusted reply. "Nox is game&mdash;true blue; you
can bet on him till the cows come home."</p>

<p>Which was more than Nox could say about his two pals.</p>

<p>Kit Woodford may have spoken with confidence, but he was not
as free from misgivings as he would have it appear. He could not
feel sure of their missing companion. If the report which they
had heard did not mean that he had been slain, his capture looked
certain, and there was no saying what he might do to secure leniency.
Kit knew what <em>he</em> would do in a similar situation.</p>

<p>"Well, come on," he growled. "We're in tough luck to-night."</p>

<p>And the two pushed their way among the trees in the direction
of the river.</p>

<p>Meantime, matters remained interesting at the home of Widow Friestone.
The words of young Jim Buxton told a graphic story which made
even Nora laugh and forget for the time the frightful excitement
they had passed through. When the merriment had partly subsided,
Mike drew one of his remaining two quarters from his pocket and
handed it to Nora.</p>

<p>"Will ye do me the kindness to presint that to Jim when he comes
to the store in the morning to set the table on the front porch?"</p>

<p>"What's that for?" asked the puzzled girl.</p>

<p>"For the gayety he imparted to this gloomy avening. I don't know
as ye need say that to him, for he wouldn't understand what ye
meant until after three or four years of hard thought. But he's
airned it, and ye'll not forgit."</p>

<p>She laid the coin aside and assured the donor that his wishes
should be carried out.</p>

<p>Chester spoke:</p>

<p>"It seems to me we are throwing away time. It is past midnight
and here we sit talking, and doing nothing because there seems
nothing to do. What do you think, Alvin?"</p>

<p>"You are right. This business doesn't seem to have stirred up
the town. I don't suppose anyone knows what has happened except
Mr. Buxton and his family, and I don't think he will tell the
particulars himself."</p>

<p>"That can be lift to Jim," said Mike, "onless his dad imprisses
upon him that it won't be healthy for him to talk too freely wid
his mouth regarding the sarcus he obsarved this avening."</p>

<p>"The lookout in front ran off at the first sign of danger, and
if there was a second one he ran too. It will be a long time before
any member of that party pays Beartown a second visit."</p>

<p>Alvin now made known the fear in his mind&mdash;a fear that was shared
by Chester. The <em>Deerfoot</em> was lying against the bank in
Back River exposed to any injury which these criminals might choose
to inflict by way of revenge. He proposed that the mother and
daughter, after refastening the window and locking up, should
retire to their beds, while the boys returned to the launch to
make sure no harm befell it.</p>

<p>This course was only the commonest prudence, but the hostess
and her daughter were clearly so nervous over being left alone
for the remainder of the night that Alvin regretted his proposal.
Nora especially did not try to hide her distress.</p>

<p>"Never mind," Alvin made haste to say, "we will wait till morning.
You have been so kind that we cannot willingly cause you a moment's
pain."</p>

<p>"May I make a suggistion?" asked Mike, speaking so seriously
that all knew he was about to say something worth while.</p>

<p>"I know he's going to tell us the right thing," said Nora.</p>

<p>"How could I do itherwise wid yer bright eyes cheering me?" he
asked, with his expansive grin. "The same is this: Do ye two spalpeens
go down to the launch and stay there till morning while I remain
behind wid the misthress and sweet Nora, and keep off the burglars
wid that same gun that sarved me so well."</p>

<p>Only Alvin and Chester knew the chivalry of this proposal. Mike
regretted keenly the separation from them, even though it promised
to be for only a few hours.</p>

<p>"That is asking too much," said the widow, though her countenance
brightened with pleasure.</p>

<p>"How can the same be asking too much whin ye haven't asked it?"</p>

<p>Nora clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"I can't hilp it if she looks upon mesilf as worth the two of
ye," said Mike, with an assumption of dignity that deceived no
one.</p>

<p>"It is good on your part, Mike," said Alvin. "I feel as if we
ought to give attention to the boat, and you may as well stay
here. We'll wait for you in the morning."</p>

<p>"Don't feel obleeged to do the same. Something may turn up that
may cause ye to hurry off. If it be so, don't tarry a minute for
me."</p>

<p>"Possibly you may prove right, but we shall hate to leave you
behind."</p>

<p>"Ye may do so foriver, so long as I have such quarters as these."</p>

<p>With this understanding, the friends parted, no one dreaming
of what was to befall them before all met again.</p>
