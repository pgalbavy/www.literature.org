<p> A <em>SHIP </em>in dock, surrounded by quays and the walls of
warehouses, has the appearance of a prisoner meditating upon freedom
in the sadness of a free spirit put under restraint.  Chain cables
and stout ropes keep her bound to stone posts at the edge of a
paved shore, and a berthing-master, with brass buttons on his
coat, walks about like a weather-beaten and ruddy gaoler, casting
jealous, watchful glances upon the moorings that fetter a ship
lying passive and still and safe, as if lost in deep regrets of
her days of liberty and danger on the sea.</p>

<p>The swarm of renegades—dock-masters, berthing-masters, gatemen,
and such like—appear to nurse an immense distrust of the captive
ship’s resignation.  There never seem chains and ropes enough
to satisfy their minds concerned with the safe binding of free
ships to the strong, muddy, enslaved earth.  "You had better put
another bight of a hawser astern, Mr. Mate," is the usual phrase
in their mouth.  I brand them for renegades, because most of them
have been sailors in their time.  As if the infirmities of old
age—the gray hair, the wrinkles at the corners of the eyes, and
the knotted veins of the hands—were the symptoms of moral poison,
they prowl about the quays with an underhand air of gloating over
the broken spirit of noble captives.  They want more fenders,
more breasting-ropes; they want more springs, more shackles, more
fetters; they want to make ships with volatile souls as motionless
as square blocks of stone.  They stand on the mud of pavements,
these degraded sea-dogs, with long lines of railway-trucks clanking
their couplings behind their backs, and run malevolent glances
over your ship from headgear to taffrail, only wishing to tyrannize
over the poor creature under the hypocritical cloak of benevolence
and care.  Here and there cargo cranes looking like instruments
of torture for ships swing cruel hooks at the end of long chains. 
Gangs of dock-labourers swarm with muddy feet over the gangways. 
It is a moving sight this, of so many men of the earth, earthy,
who never cared anything for a ship, trampling unconcerned, brutal
and hob-nailed upon her helpless body.</p>

<p>Fortunately, nothing can deface the beauty of a ship.  That sense
of a dungeon, that sense of a horrible and degrading misfortune
overtaking a creature fair to see and safe to trust, attaches
only to ships moored in the docks of great European ports.  You
feel that they are dishonestly locked up, to be hunted about from
wharf to wharf on a dark, greasy, square pool of black water as
a brutal reward at the end of a faithful voyage.</p>

<p>A ship anchored in an open roadstead, with cargo-lighters alongside
and her own tackle swinging the burden over the rail, is accomplishing
in freedom a function of her life.  There is no restraint; there
is space: clear water around her, and a clear sky above her mastheads,
with a landscape of green hills and charming bays opening around
her anchorage. She is not abandoned by her own men to the tender
mercies of shore people.  She still shelters, and is looked after
by, her own little devoted band, and you feel that presently she
will glide between the headlands and disappear.  It is only at
home, in dock, that she lies abandoned, shut off from freedom
by all the artifices of men that think of quick despatch and profitable
freights.  It is only then that the odious, rectangular shadows
of walls and roofs fall upon her decks, with showers of soot.</p>

<p>To a man who has never seen the extraordinary nobility, strength,
and grace that the devoted generations of ship-builders have evolved
from some pure nooks of their simple souls, the sight that could
be seen five-and-twenty years ago of a large fleet of clippers
moored along the north side of the New South Dock was an inspiring
spectacle.  Then there was a quarter of a mile of them, from the
iron dockyard-gates guarded by policemen, in a long, forest-like
perspective of masts, moored two and two to many stout wooden
jetties.  Their spars dwarfed with their loftiness the corrugated-iron
sheds, their jibbooms extended far over the shore, their white-and-gold
figure-heads, almost dazzling in their purity, overhung the straight,
long quay above the mud and dirt of the wharfside, with the busy
figures of groups and single men moving to and fro, restless and
grimy under their soaring immobility.</p>

<p>At tide-time you would see one of the loaded ships with battened-down
hatches drop out of the ranks and float in the clear space of
the dock, held by lines dark and slender, like the first threads
of a spider’s web, extending from her bows and her quarters to
the mooring-posts on shore. There, graceful and still, like a
bird ready to spread its wings, she waited till, at the opening
of the gates, a tug or two would hurry in noisily, hovering round
her with an air of fuss and solicitude, and take her out into
the river, tending, shepherding her through open bridges, through
dam-like gates between the flat pier-heads, with a bit of green
lawn surrounded by gravel and a white signal-mast with yard and
gaff, flying a couple of dingy blue, red, or white flags.</p>

<p>This New South Dock (it was its official name), round which my
earlier professional memories are centred, belongs to the group
of West India Docks, together with two smaller and much older
basins called Import and Export respectively, both with the greatness
of their trade departed from them already.  Picturesque and clean
as docks go, these twin basins spread side by side the dark lustre
of their glassy water, sparely peopled by a few ships laid up
on buoys or tucked far away from each other at the end of sheds
in the corners of empty quays, where they seemed to slumber quietly
remote, untouched by the bustle of men’s affairs—in retreat rather
than in captivity.  They were quaint and sympathetic, those two
homely basins, unfurnished and silent, with no aggressive display
of cranes, no apparatus of hurry and work on their narrow shores. 
No railway-lines cumbered them.  The knots of labourers trooping
in clumsily round the corners of cargo-sheds to eat their food
in peace out of red cotton handkerchiefs had the air of picnicking
by the side of a lonely mountain pool.  They were restful (and
I should say very unprofitable), those basins, where the chief
officer of one of the ships involved in the harassing, strenuous,
noisy activity of the New South Dock only a few yards away could
escape in the dinner-hour to stroll, unhampered by men and affairs,
meditating (if he chose) on the vanity of all things human.  At
one time they must have been full of good old slow West Indiamen
of the square-stern type, that took their captivity, one imagines,
as stolidly as they had faced the buffeting of the waves with
their blunt, honest bows, and disgorged sugar, rum, molasses,
coffee, or logwood sedately with their own winch and tackle. 
But when I knew them, of exports there was never a sign that one
could detect; and all the imports I have ever seen were some rare
cargoes of tropical timber, enormous baulks roughed out of iron
trunks grown in the woods about the Gulf of Mexico.  They lay
piled up in stacks of mighty boles, and it was hard to believe
that all this mass of dead and stripped trees had come out of
the flanks of a slender, innocent-looking little barque with,
as likely as not, a homely woman’s name—Ellen this or Annie that—upon
her fine bows.  But this is generally the case with a discharged
cargo.  Once spread at large over the quay, it looks the most
impossible bulk to have all come there out of that ship alongside.</p>

<p>They were quiet, serene nooks in the busy world of docks, these
basins where it has never been my good luck to get a berth after
some more or less arduous passage.  But one could see at a glance
that men and ships were never hustled there.  They were so quiet
that, remembering them well, one comes to doubt that they ever
existed—places of repose for tired ships to dream in, places of
meditation rather than work, where wicked ships—the cranky, the
lazy, the wet, the bad sea boats, the wild steerers, the capricious,
the pig-headed, the generally ungovernable—would have full leisure
to take count and repent of their sins, sorrowful and naked, with
their rent garments of sailcloth stripped off them, and with the
dust and ashes of the London atmosphere upon their mastheads. 
For that the worst of ships would repent if she were ever given
time I make no doubt.  I have known too many of them.  No ship
is wholly bad; and now that their bodies that had braved so many
tempests have been blown off the face of the sea by a puff of
steam, the evil and the good together into the limbo of things
that have served their time, there can be no harm in affirming
that in these vanished generations of willing servants there never
has been one utterly unredeemable soul.</p>

<p>In the New South Dock there was certainly no time for remorse,
introspection, repentance, or any phenomena of inner life either
for the captive ships or for their officers.  From six in the
morning till six at night the hard labour of the prison-house,
which rewards the valiance of ships that win the harbour went
on steadily, great slings of general cargo swinging over the rail,
to drop plumb into the hatchways at the sign of the gangway-tender’s
hand.  The New South Dock was especially a loading dock for the
Colonies in those great (and last) days of smart wool-clippers,
good to look at and—well—exciting to handle.  Some of them were
more fair to see than the others; many were (to put it mildly)
somewhat over-masted; all were expected to make good passages;
and of all that line of ships, whose rigging made a thick, enormous
network against the sky, whose brasses flashed almost as far as
the eye of the policeman at the gates could reach, there was hardly
one that knew of any other port amongst all the ports on the wide
earth but London and Sydney, or London and Melbourne, or London
and Adelaide, perhaps with Hobart Town added for those of smaller
tonnage.  One could almost have believed, as her gray-whiskered
second mate used to say of the old <em>Duke of S—</em>, that they
knew the road to the Antipodes better than their own skippers,
who, year in, year out, took them from London—the place of captivity—to
some Australian port where, twenty-five years ago, though moored
well and tight enough to the wooden wharves, they felt themselves
no captives, but honoured guests.</p>
