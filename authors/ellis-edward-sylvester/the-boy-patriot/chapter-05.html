<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Blair Robertson had long had a famous military company of his
own, called the Fairport Guard. A guard <em>against what</em>
had never been publicly stated; and as they had no written constitution
for their association, posterity must ever remain in ignorance
on this point. Up and down the streets of Fairport it was their
delight to parade on a Saturday afternoon, to the infinite amusement
of the small girls who ate molasses candy and looked at the imposing
array.</p>

<p>The breaking out of the war infused a new military spirit into
all the youngsters on the Atlantic coast, and the Fairport Guard
came in for their share of this growing enthusiasm. Cocks' tail
feathers and broomsticks were suddenly in great requisition for
the increasing rank and file, and the officers bore themselves
with added dignity, and gave out their orders with an earnestness
which proved that they appreciated the work they were imitating.</p>

<p>When it was rumored that Blair Robertson had become a communicant
in the church to which his mother belonged, there was a general
groan among his old followers and adherents. Here was an end,
in their minds, to the Fairport Guard, and every other species
of fun in which Blair had been so long a leader and abettor.</p>

<p>Blair was at first inclined to shrink from his old companions;
but as the right spirit grew and strengthened within him, he mingled
among them more freely, actuated by the desire to win new citizens
for the kingdom of heaven, and to guide his wild associates into
such paths as would make them a blessing to their native land.</p>

<p>Blair's heart had been like rich ground, in which his mother
had been sowing, sowing, sowing good seed, prayerfully waiting
until it should spring up and take root to his own salvation and
the glory of God. That happy time had come. All the words of counsel,
all the pure teaching that had been stored in his mind, seemed
now warmed into life, and ever rising up to prompt him to good
and guard him from evil. Happy are the boys who have such a mother.</p>

<p>A series of rainy Saturdays had postponed the question as to
whether the Fairport Guard should parade as usual under the command
of their long honored captain. A bright sunny holiday came at
last, and Blair's decision on this point must now be declared.
Long and prayerfully the boy had considered the subject, and his
conclusion was fixed and unalterable.</p>

<p>The change in Blair's principles and feelings had not alienated
him from his former companions. Each one of them had now for him
a new value. They were to him wandering children of his heavenly
Father, whom he longed to bring back to that Father's house. The
wildest and most erring among them called forth his most tender
interest, as farthest from the kingdom of heaven and in the most
danger of utter destruction.</p>

<p>Blair's love of his country too had been but deepened and increased
by his late realization of the allegiance he himself owed to the
King of kings. His native land was now to him a dear portion of
the great vineyard on which he desired the especial blessing of
God. He more deeply appreciated the fact that every true Christian
man is indeed an element of wholesome life and prosperity to the
neighborhood and land in which he dwells. The boys of the present
day were soon to be the men on whom the state must rely for power
and permanency. With a true patriot's zeal, Blair resolved to
do all in his power to bring the boys of Fairport to be such Christian
men as would be a blessing in their day and generation. These
thoughts had gone far to fix his decision with reference to the
Fairport Guard.</p>

<p>It was with a burst of enthusiastic applause that the little
company saw Blair appear upon the public square in his well-known
uniform. His three-cornered hat of black pasteboard was surmounted
by a long black feather, and fastened under his chin by a fine
leather strap, the strap being bordered by a ferocious pair of
whiskers, to afford which the "black sheep" of some neighboring
flock had evidently suffered. His grandfather's coat, which had
been worn at Bunker Hill, enveloped his slender form, and increased
the imposing effect of his tall figure upon the minds of his subordinates.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Captain Robertson! Three cheers for Blair!"
shouted the boys as their leader approached.</p>

<p>The cheers rung out on the air somewhat feebly, though that was
owing to the weakness of the throats that raised them, rather
than to any want of goodwill, and so Blair understood it.</p>

<p>"Now give us a speech before we fall into rank," called out one
of the company.</p>

<p>"That is just what I mean to do, if you will all listen to me,"
said the captain in his most dignified manner.</p>

<p>The stump of a fallen tree served to elevate our speaker on this
occasion, as it has many an older orator in circumstances no more
interesting to his hearers than were the present to the eager
group of listeners.</p>

<p>Blair had another purpose now than to hear himself talk. The
short pause which preceded his opening sentence was not merely
for effect. In those few seconds Blair was asking aid from his
heavenly Father so to speak that he might have power to move his
hearers and guide them aright.</p>

<p>"Boys," he began, "boys, I want to be your captain. I don't want
to give up the Fairport Guard. We have had many a good time together,
and I love you all; yes, every one. Our marching and drilling
has hitherto been play, but now we ought to be in earnest. We
should prepare to be really a guard to our native town. At any
moment the British may land on our shores, and threaten the lives
of those who are dearest to us. We must be able to protect our
mothers and sisters if the evil day comes. We must learn the use
of firearms. This musket did duty at Bunker Hill. Every young
patriot here must learn to use it well. In due time we must each
have our musket, and make it carry true, if need be, to the heart
of the enemy. But, boys, if we are to be real defenders of our
native land, we must be worthy of such an honor. I am willing,
I want to be your captain; but hear the rules I propose for our
company: We are to be a temperance band; no drop of the cup that
intoxicates must pass our lips. No profane word must sully our
tongues. The name of the God of our fathers must be honored among
us. Any member of this company who shall be found guilty of a
lie, a theft, or bullying the weak and defenceless, shall be cast
out by common vote. We will strive to be a credit to our beloved
home&mdash;true American citizens, who may dare to ask God to bless
them in all their undertakings and prosper all they do. Boys,
do you agree to these regulations? If so, I shall rejoice to be
your captain. If not, I must sadly bid adieu to the Fairport Guard,
and with this time-honored musket in my hand, stand alone on the
threshold of my home in the hour of danger, trusting in God and
in the strength of this single right-arm."</p>

<p>As Blair concluded, he grounded his musket, and stood silently
awaiting the reply of his companions.</p>

<p>There was a moment of hesitation; then one of the older boys,
the first-lieutenant, stepped forward and silently placed himself
at the side of his young commander. In true martial style the
whole company followed, arraying themselves around their leader.</p>

<p>"We agree! We agree! We agree to every thing!" shouted one and
all.</p>

<p>"May God help us to keep to our compact," said Blair. Then, after
a short pause, he added, "Let me propose to you a new member for
our company&mdash;my friend Hal Hutchings, who, born on English soil,
is yet a true American at heart. Let all in favor of his admission
say Aye."</p>

<p>Hal had been striving to give himself a military air by appearing
in his red flannel shirt and trousers, while Old Jock's red night-cap
was perched above the yellow curls of the boy. As his name was
mentioned, he raised to his shoulder a borrowed crutch which served
him for a musket, as if to signify his readiness for martial duty.</p>

<p>"The English boy! Admit the English boy!" said several voices;
but a hearty "Aye, aye" from two or three prominent members of
the company decided the question in Hal's favor, and he was admitted
at once by general consent.</p>

<p>Forming now in regular ranks, the Fairport Guard went through
their usual drill, and then set off in a creditable march, to
let the citizens have a view of their doughty defenders.</p>
