<p>Whether or not I was to be so much blamed, or rather perhaps
pitied, I must leave others to judge. My shrewdness (of which
I have a good deal, too) seems not so great with the ladies. No
doubt, at the moment when I awaked her, I was thinking a good
deal of the effect upon James More; and similarly when I returned
and we were all sat down to breakfast, I continued to behave to
the young lady with deference and distance; as I still think to
have been most wise. Her father had cast doubts upon the innocence
of my friendship; and these, it was my first business to allay.
But there is a kind of an excuse for Catriona also. We had shared
in a scene of some tenderness and passion, and given and received
caresses: I had thrust her from me with violence; I had called
aloud upon her in the night from the one room to the other; she
had passed hours of wakefulness and weeping; and it is not to
be supposed I had been absent from her pillow thoughts. Upon the
back of this, to be awaked, with unaccustomed formality, under
the name of Miss Drummond, and to be thenceforth used with a great
deal of distance and respect, led her entirely in error on my
private sentiments; and she was indeed so incredibly abused as
to imagine me repentant and trying to draw off!</p>

<p>The trouble betwixt us seems to have been this: that whereas
I (since I had first set eyes on his great hat) thought singly
of James More, his return and suspicions, she made so little of
these that I may say she scarce remarked them, and all her troubles
and doings regarded what had passed between us in the night before.
This is partly to be explained by the innocence and boldness of
her character; and partly because James More, having sped so ill
in his interview with me, or had his mouth closed by my invitation,
said no word to her upon the subject. At the breakfast, accordingly,
it soon appeared we were at cross purposes. I had looked to find
her in clothes of her own: I found her (as if her father were
forgotten) wearing some of the best that I had bought for her,
and which she knew (or thought) that I admired her in. I had looked
to find her imitate my affectation of distance, and be most precise
and formal; instead I found her flushed and wild-like, with eyes
extraordinary bright, and a painful and varying expression, calling
me by name with a sort of appeal of tenderness, and referring
and deferring to my thoughts and wishes like an anxious or a suspected
wife.</p>

<p>But this was not for long. As I behold her so regardless of her
own interests, which I had jeopardised and was now endeavouring
to recover, I redoubled my own coldness in the manner of a lesson
to the girl. The more she came forward, the farther I drew back;
the more she betrayed the closeness of our intimacy, the more
pointedly civil I became, until even her father (if he had not
been so engrossed with eating) might have observed the opposition.
In the midst of which, of a sudden, she became wholly changed,
and I told myself, with a good deal of relief, that she had took
the hint at last.</p>

<p>All day I was at my classes or in quest of my new lodging; and
though the hour of our customary walk hung miserably on my hands,
I cannot say but I was happy on the whole to find my way cleared,
the girl again in proper keeping, the father satisfied or at least
acquiescent, and myself free to prosecute my love with honour.
At supper, as at all our meals, it was James More that did the
talking. No doubt but he talked well if anyone could have believed
him. But I will speak of him presently more at large. The meal
at an end, he rose, got his great coat, and looking (as I thought)
at me, observed he had affairs abroad. I took this for a hint
that I was to be going also, and got up; whereupon the girl, who
had scarce given me greeting at my entrance, turned her eyes upon
me wide open with a look that bade me stay. I stood between them
like a fish out of water, turning from one to the other; neither
seemed to observe me, she gazing on the floor, he buttoning his
coat: which vastly swelled my embarrassment. This appearance of
indifference argued, upon her side, a good deal of anger very
near to burst out. Upon his, I thought it horribly alarming; I
made sure there was a tempest brewing there; and considering that
to be the chief peril, turned towards him and put myself (so to
speak) in the man’s hands.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for <em>you</em>, Mr. Drummond?" says I.</p>

<p>He stifled a yawn, which again I thought to be duplicity. "Why,
Mr. David," said he, "since you are so obliging as to propose
it, you might show me the way to a certain tavern" (of which he
gave the name) "where I hope to fall in with some old companions
in arms."</p>

<p>There was no more to say, and I got my hat and cloak to bear
him company.</p>

<p>"And as for you," say he to his daughter, "you had best go to
your bed. I shall be late home, and <em>Early to bed and early
to rise</em>, <em>gars bonny lasses have bright eyes</em>."</p>

<p>Whereupon he kissed her with a good deal of tenderness, and ushered
me before him from the door. This was so done (I thought on purpose)
that it was scarce possible there should be any parting salutation;
but I observed she did not look at me, and set it down to terror
of James More.</p>

<p>It was some distance to that tavern. He talked all the way of
matters which did not interest me the smallest, and at the door
dismissed me with empty manners. Thence I walked to my new lodging,
where I had not so much as a chimney to hold me warm, and no society
but my own thoughts. These were still bright enough; I did not
so much as dream that Catriona was turned against me; I thought
we were like folk pledged; I thought we had been too near and
spoke too warmly to be severed, least of all by what were only
steps in a most needful policy. And the chief of my concern was
only the kind of father-in-law that I was getting, which was not
at all the kind I would have chosen: and the matter of how soon
I ought to speak to him, which was a delicate point on several
sides. In the first place, when I thought how young I was I blushed
all over, and could almost have found it in my heart to have desisted;
only that if once I let them go from Leyden without explanation,
I might lose her altogether. And in the second place, there was
our very irregular situation to be kept in view, and the rather
scant measure of satisfaction I had given James More that morning.
I concluded, on the whole, that delay would not hurt anything,
yet I would not delay too long neither; and got to my cold bed
with a full heart.</p>

<p>The next day, as James More seemed a little on the complaining
hand in the matter of my chamber, I offered to have in more furniture;
and coming in the afternoon, with porters bringing chairs and
tables, found the girl once more left to herself. She greeted
me on my admission civilly, but withdrew at once to her own room,
of which she shut the door. I made my disposition, and paid and
dismissed the men so that she might hear them go, when I supposed
she would at once come forth again to speak to me. I waited yet
awhile, then knocked upon her door.</p>

<p>"Catriona!" said I.</p>

<p>The door was opened so quickly, even before I had the word out,
that I thought she must have stood behind it listening. She remained
there in the interval quite still; but she had a look that I cannot
put a name on, as of one in a bitter trouble.</p>

<p>"Are we not to have our walk to-day either?" so I faltered.</p>

<p>"I am thanking you," said she. "I will not be caring much to
walk, now that my father is come home."</p>

<p>"But I think he has gone out himself and left you here alone,"
said I.</p>

<p>"And do you think that was very kindly said?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It was not unkindly meant," I replied. "What ails you, Catriona?
What have I done to you that you should turn from me like this?"</p>

<p>"I do not turn from you at all," she said, speaking very carefully.
"I will ever be grateful to my friend that was good to me; I will
ever be his friend in all that I am able. But now that my father
James More is come again, there is a difference to be made, and
I think there are some things said and done that would be better
to be forgotten. But I will ever be your friend in all that I
am able, and if that is not all that . . . . if it is not so much
. . . . Not that you will be caring! But I would not have you
think of me too hard. It was true what you said to me, that I
was too young to be advised, and I am hoping you will remember
I was just a child. I would not like to lose your friendship,
at all events."</p>

<p>She began this very pale; but before she was done, the blood
was in her face like scarlet, so that not her words only, but
her face and the trembling of her very hands, besought me to be
gentle. I saw, for the first time, how very wrong I had done to
place the child in that position, where she had been entrapped
into a moment’s weakness, and now stood before me like a person
shamed.</p>

<p>"Miss Drummond," I said, and stuck, and made the same beginning
once again, "I wish you could see into my heart," I cried. "You
would read there that my respect is undiminished. If that were
possible, I should say it was increased. This is but the result
of the mistake we made; and had to come; and the less said of
it now the better. Of all of our life here, I promise you it shall
never pass my lips; I would like to promise you too that I would
never think of it, but it’s a memory that will be always dear
to me. And as for a friend, you have one here that would die for
you."</p>

<p>"I am thanking you," said she.</p>

<p>We stood awhile silent, and my sorrow for myself began to get
the upper hand; for here were all my dreams come to a sad tumble,
and my love lost, and myself alone again in the world as at the
beginning.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "we shall be friends always, that’s a certain
thing. But this is a kind of farewell, too: it’s a kind of a farewell
after all; I shall always ken Miss Drummond, but this is a farewell
to my Catriona."</p>

<p>I looked at her; I could hardly say I saw her, but she seemed
to grow great and brighten in my eyes; and with that I suppose
I must have lost my head, for I called out her name again and
made a step at her with my hands reached forth.</p>

<p>She shrank back like a person struck, her face flamed; but the
blood sprang no faster up into her cheeks, than what it flowed
back upon my own heart, at sight of it, with penitence and concern.
I found no words to excuse myself, but bowed before her very deep,
and went my ways out of the house with death in my bosom.</p>

<p>I think it was about five days that followed without any change.
I saw her scarce ever but at meals, and then of course in the
company of James More. If we were alone even for a moment, I made
it my devoir to behave the more distantly and to multiply respectful
attentions, having always in my mind’s eye that picture of the
girl shrinking and flaming in a blush, and in my heart more pity
for her than I could depict in words. I was sorry enough for myself,
I need not dwell on that, having fallen all my length and more
than all my height in a few seconds; but, indeed, I was near as
sorry for the girl, and sorry enough to be scarce angry with her
save by fits and starts. Her plea was good; she had been placed
in an unfair position; if she had deceived herself and me, it
was no more than was to have been looked for.</p>

<p>And for another thing she was now very much alone. Her father,
when he was by, was rather a caressing parent; but he was very
easy led away by his affairs and pleasures, neglected her without
compunction or remark, spent his nights in taverns when he had
the money, which was more often than I could at all account for;
and even in the course of these few days, failed once to come
to a meal, which Catriona and I were at last compelled to partake
of without him. It was the evening meal, and I left immediately
that I had eaten, observing I supposed she would prefer to be
alone; to which she agreed and (strange as it may seem) I quite
believed her. Indeed, I thought myself but an eyesore to the girl,
and a reminder of a moment’s weakness that she now abhorred to
think of. So she must sit alone in that room where she and I had
been so merry, and in the blink of that chimney whose light had
shone upon our many difficult and tender moments. There she must
sit alone, and think of herself as of a maid who had most unmaidenly
proffered her affections and had the same rejected. And in the
meanwhile I would be alone some other place, and reading myself
(whenever I was tempted to be angry) lessons upon human frailty
and female delicacy. And altogether I suppose there were never
two poor fools made themselves more unhappy in a greater misconception.</p>

<p>As for James, he paid not so much heed to us, or to anything
in nature but his pocket, and his belly, and his own prating talk.
Before twelve hours were gone he had raised a small loan of me;
before thirty, he had asked for a second and been refused. Money
and refusal he took with the same kind of high good nature. Indeed,
he had an outside air of magnanimity that was very well fitted
to impose upon a daughter; and the light in which he was constantly
presented in his talk, and the man’s fine presence and great ways
went together pretty harmoniously. So that a man that had no business
with him, and either very little penetration or a furious deal
of prejudice, might almost have been taken in. To me, after my
first two interviews, he was as plain as print; I saw him to be
perfectly selfish, with a perfect innocency in the same; and I
would hearken to his swaggering talk (of arms, and "an old soldier,"
and "a poor Highland gentleman," and "the strength of my country
and my friends") as I might to the babbling of a parrot.</p>

<p>The odd thing was that I fancy he believed some part of it himself,
or did at times; I think he was so false all through that he scarce
knew when he was lying; and for one thing, his moments of dejection
must have been wholly genuine. There were times when he would
be the most silent, affectionate, clinging creature possible,
holding Catriona’s hand like a big baby, and begging of me not
to leave if I had any love to him; of which, indeed, I had none,
but all the more to his daughter. He would press and indeed beseech
us to entertain him with our talk, a thing very difficult in the
state of our relations; and again break forth in pitiable regrets
for his own land and friends, or into Gaelic singing.</p>

<p>"This is one of the melancholy airs of my native land," he would
say. "You may think it strange to see a soldier weep, and indeed
it is to make a near friend of you," says he. "But the notes of
this singing are in my blood, and the words come out of my heart.
And when I mind upon my red mountains and the wild birds calling
there, and the brave streams of water running down, I would scarce
think shame to weep before my enemies." Then he would sing again,
and translate to me pieces of the song, with a great deal of boggling
and much expressed contempt against the English language. "It
says here," he would say, "that the sun is gone down, and the
battle is at an end, and the brave chiefs are defeated. And it
tells here how the stars see them fleeing into strange countries
or lying dead on the red mountain; and they will never more shout
the call of battle or wash their feet in the streams of the valley.
But if you had only some of this language, you would weep also
because the words of it are beyond all expression, and it is mere
mockery to tell you it in English."</p>

<p>Well, I thought there was a good deal of mockery in the business,
one way and another; and yet, there was some feeling too, for
which I hated him, I think, the worst of all. And it used to cut
me to the quick to see Catriona so much concerned for the old
rogue, and weeping herself to see him weep, when I was sure one
half of his distress flowed from his last night’s drinking in
some tavern. There were times when I was tempted to lend him a
round sum, and see the last of him for good; but this would have
been to see the last of Catriona as well, for which I was scarcely
so prepared; and besides, it went against my conscience to squander
my good money on one who was so little of a husband.</p>
