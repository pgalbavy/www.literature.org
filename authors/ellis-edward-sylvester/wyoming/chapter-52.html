<p>Among the most eager pursuers of the treacherous Tory and his
Seneca allies, was Habakkuk McEwen, who had withdrawn to the rear
of the settlers that held the Indians at their mercy during the
interview between Jake Golcher and Fred Godfrey.</p>

<p>The natural timidity of the new Englander led him to do this,
but he was so infuriated by the act of the party, that he lost
all thought of personal danger, and charged through the wood at
the very head of the avengers.</p>

<p>McEwen had no rifle, but he quickly supplied himself with one.
Catching sight of a Seneca who had fallen before the volley of
Dick Durkee and his comrades, he snatched the weapon from his
rigid grasp and sped along like a deer.</p>

<p>He had ammunition, and a hasty examination showed that the gun
was unloaded. With a coolness hardly to be expected, McEwen stopped
in his pursuit and deliberately recharged the rifle, which seemed
to be a fine weapon.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be catched without anything to help myself with,"
he said to himself, resuming the chase.</p>

<p>This was conducted in such a blind, headlong fashion, that Habakkuk
speedily found himself not only out of sight of the Indians, but
of his comrades, who were threshing in different directions, some
of them shouting like madmen.</p>

<p>"I think they'll make for the river," concluded the New Englander,
after a moment's pause, "and I'll keep on till I reach the water
myself."</p>

<p>As the flush of the first excitement wore off, Habakkuk began
to doubt whether he was doing a prudent thing, in chasing a whole
war party in this single-handed style.</p>

<p>"I'll take a little pains that they don't get after <em>me</em>,"
he thought, beginning to use more caution in his movements.</p>

<p>It was a considerable distance to the Susquehanna, but he pushed
on, and just as the gray light of the morning was penetrating
the wilderness and spreading over the water, he caught the familiar
gleam of the beautiful stream.</p>

<p>Looking across, he paused in silent contemplation of the familiar
scene. Naturally, he first noticed that landmark so well remembered
by old settlers, which was known as the "umbrella tree," on account
of its peculiar shape, and which was visible a long distance,
standing as it did on the mountains of the western shore.</p>

<p>But he was withdrawn from viewing the general features of the
landscape, by the sight of the heavy smoke that rested like a
pall on the other bank. It partly shut out from sight the straggling
houses, most of which were smoldering ashes, and suggested the
awful desolation that had been wrought in Wyoming Valley during
the few hours that had passed since the memorable battle was fought
near Forty Fort.</p>

<p>"I've no doubt pandemonium was let loose there last night," muttered
Habakkuk, "and it was a good thing for us that we got across when
we did, and a much better thing that Dick Durkee and his men j'ined
us &mdash;Hello!"</p>

<p>He was standing where his body was pretty well screened, and
was wondering that he saw no one moving, when he was alarmed by
a splash in the water a short distance above him.</p>

<p>Fearful of being discovered, Habakkuk crouched down, and cocked
his gun.</p>

<p>"It must be some of the scoundrels, who are everywhere; I hadn't
orter been quite so rash&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment some one sprang into the river, and, wading out
a short distance, began swimming for the other shore.</p>

<p>The timid patriot did not dare look out at him until he had gotten
some distance away, when he peeped through the undergrowth, and
scrutinized the head and shoulders that were moving rapidly across
the stream.</p>

<p>Then, to his amazement, he recognized the man as Jake Golcher,
the Tory, who had wrought all this ruin and sorrow; though Habakkuk
was far from suspecting the whole result of the shot of the renegade.</p>

<p>"By the great CÃ¦sar! it's him," gasped Habakkuk, trembling with
excitement; "and that gives me a chance to win some laurels with
the other folks, especially with pretty Maggie."</p>

<p>Assuming a kneeling position, he took the most careful aim of
his life at the unsuspecting ingrate, and when certain there could
be no miss, pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>There was no flash in the pan nor miss of aim. The career of
Jake Golcher ended then and there, with a suddenness and freedom
from suffering that were mercy compared to what he deserved.</p>

<p>Habakkuk McEwen lingered long enough to make certain that there
was no mistake, and then he stealthily reloaded his rifle before
stirring from the spot. He was apprehensive when several Indians
appeared on the other shore and showed some signs of an intention
to cross the stream.</p>

<p>This was enough for McEwen, who scrambled out of his hiding-place,
and scarcely paused until he reached the camp, where he came upon
the sorrowful scene to which we have already referred.</p>

<p>Mr. Brainerd was no more, and the mourning friends, having rallied
from their first shock of grief, were preparing to leave the spot,
which for a while to come must be one of exceeding great danger
to them.</p>

<p>After some consultation, Fred Godfrey, Dick Durkee, and Gravity
Gimp tenderly lifted the body and carried it to a mass of rocks
but a short distance away.</p>

<p>Had they possessed a shovel they would have given it burial until
they could return, but that was impossible.</p>

<p>Accordingly, it was laid away in a natural sepulchre, and the
boulders were so piled around it as to prevent disturbance from
animals; then all bade it a tearful adieu, and the faces of the
little party were turned toward the far-off settlements of the
upper Delaware.</p>

<p>Already the sounds of firing and the shouts of Indians were heard
from the other side of the Susquehanna, while terrified fugitives
were continually encountered.</p>

<p>Some of these were in such sore extremity that they were taken
charge of by Fred Godfrey and Dick Durkee. Maggie and Eva Brainerd
were so melted by their own sufferings that they found it impossible
to pass by any of the poor beings without doing their utmost to
relieve their distress.</p>

<p>And among all the fugitives that hastened in such horror from
the Wyoming settlements that day, there were many who had been
smitten in a more cruel manner than the loving daughters, but
there was not one whose woe was deeper than theirs.</p>

<p>Eva and Maggie bore it like the heroines they were, and but for
their pale faces and swollen eyes no one would have suspected
the depth of their anguish. They said nothing to show it, but
were as busy and thoughtful for the others as though all were
their brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Aunt Peggy was silent most of the time, but now and then her
hard features quivered with emotion, and she uttered anathemas
against those who had wrought all this mischief and sorrow.</p>

<p>Gravity Gimp was the most demonstrative of the company, his sobbing
and lamentations more than once bringing tears to the eyes of
the others.</p>

<p>When Habakkuk McEwen made known that he had ended the career
of Jake Golcher there was not one who would believe him; but,
fortunately for the New Englander's reputation, his declaration
was confirmed in an unexpected manner.</p>

<p>One of Dick Durkee's men was late in joining the party that started
away that morning, but when he came he said that he, too, was
stealing along the river bank, though a considerable distance
above where Golcher entered it. As soon as he identified the Tory
he raised his gun to shoot, but when he pulled the trigger he
discovered that there was no charge in the weapon.</p>

<p>With an expression of impatience he proceeded to correct his
mistake, and was in the act of pouring powder in the pan when
the crack of some one's else gun sounded just below him.</p>

<p>The woodman could not see who fired it, but he saw the Tory throw
up his arms and disappear, so that a second shot was unnecessary.
He tarried, however, some time longer, and observed three Indians
who swam out into the river in search of the body, showing that
they, too, knew who it was.</p>

<p>This settled the question; and henceforth Habakkuk McEwen became
a sort of hero among his comrades, who shook him by the hand and
congratulated him on the service done his friends.</p>

<p>The vanity of the fellow was flattered, and when he attempted
to explain his previous conduct it was accepted good-naturedly;
so that, before the day was over, he came to the conclusion that
he was in point of fact the bravest and most dashing member of
the company, and the one who ought to be the leader.</p>

<p>The mountains were passed in safety, and it was not without some
misgivings that the party entered that desolate stretch of wilderness
several times referred to as the "Shades of Death."</p>

<p>What was dreaded more than anything else was the want of provisions,
which was sure to cause suffering.</p>

<p>Habakkuk McEwen was the only one in the company who had a particle
of food, and when that came to be distributed among eight or ten
women that had been gathered about them, it was scarcely more
than an aggravation of hunger.</p>

<p>Our own friends, it will be remembered, had eaten a substantial
meal of young pig the previous evening, and were in much better
form than many who had fled from Wyoming, and had partaken of
no food during the previous twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The sufferings of the fugitives from Wyoming in passing through
the "Shades of Death" were dreadful, as is always the case where
such large bodies flee in a panic.</p>

<p>Many children were born, and perished in the wilderness. Strong
men lay down and died, and the bones of the victims marked every
mile of the way.</p>

<p>But there were many who survived, and one bright summer morning
all our friends reached the hamlet of Stroudsburg, so far removed
from the scene of massacre that every cause for alarm had passed.</p>

<p>There were fugitives before them, and the hospitality of the
villagers was taxed to the utmost, but they gladly met every demand.</p>

<p>The weather was so mild that much suffering had been saved the
settlers, whose trouble rose mainly from the lack of food.</p>

<p>In Stroudsburg were old friends and relatives of the Brainerds,
who did everything in their power for them. It was arranged that
Maggie, Eva, and Aunt Peggy should stay with them indefinitely
until there could be no risk in going back.</p>

<p>The anxiety of the brother and sisters was that the body of their
father should be laid away in proper form, and Fred Godfrey and
Gravity Gimp went back to Wyoming for that purpose.</p>

<p>When the sad duty was finished they once more made their way
to Stroudsburg, where the young patriot bade his friends a tender
adieu, after which he started to join the Continental army under
Washington.</p>

<p>Habakkuk McEwen went with him, and, despite a manifestation of
his natural timidity now and then, made a good record. Both he
and Fred, who had become a captain, were present at the surrender
of Yorktown, which ended the struggle of the colonies, and established
the independence of the United States of America.</p>

<p>When they returned to Wyoming the settlements had recovered,
to a great extent, from the visitation of the Tories and Indians
three years before.</p>

<p>The Brainerd homestead, which was partly burned, was restored
to a substantial condition, and Gravity Gimp was as big and strong
and devoted as ever.</p>

<p>The rich soil needed but to be "tickled with a plow" to "laugh
a harvest," and it yielded bountifully. There had been several
incursions by Indians, during one of which the little girl, Frances
Slocum, was taken off by a party of Delawares. Her wonderful history
is part of that of Wyoming.</p>

<p>But the Brainerd family suffered nothing further. Eva had grown
into a blooming girl when Captain Fred Godfrey came back and joined
them at the old homestead. All in due time, he took for his bride
one of the blue-eyed lassies of Wyoming, and Maggie and Eva were
equally fortunate in securing the best of partners for life.</p>

<p>Peace folded her gentle wings over the scene of the stirring
events that took place more than a century ago, and the thunders
of war have never awakened the echoes along that part of the Susquehanna
since.</p>

<p>May it ever be thus throughout our fair land, to the end of time.</p>
