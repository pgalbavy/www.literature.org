<p>Meanwhile Fred Sheldon had become involved in anything but a
pleasant experience.</p>

<p>There might be mistakes ludicrous and otherwise in the case of
others, but when he saw the animal in the lane before him, as
revealed by the rays of the moon, there was no error.</p>

<p>It was the identical lion that had escaped from the menagerie
the day previous, and the beast must have noted the presence of
the terrified lad, who stopped such a short distance from him.</p>

<p>Master Fred was so transfixed that he did not stir for a few
seconds, and then it seemed to him that the best thing he could
do was to turn about and run, and yell with might and main, just
as he did some weeks before when he stepped into a yellow-jackets'
nest.</p>

<p>It is hard to understand how the yelling helps a boy when caught
in such a dilemma, but we know from experience that it is easier
to screech at the top of one's voice, as you strike at the insects
that settle about your head, than it is to concentrate all your
powers in the single act of running.</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously, Fred began stepping backward, keeping his
gaze fixed upon the lion as he did so. If the latter was aware
of the stratagem, which is sometimes used with advantage by the
African hunter, he did not immediately seek to thwart it, but
continued facing him, and occasionally swaying his tail, accompanied
by low, thunderous growls.</p>

<p>The boys of the school had learned a great deal of natural history
within the last day or two, and Fred had read about the king of
beasts. He knew that a lion could crouch on his belly, and, with
one prodigious bound, pass over the intervening space.</p>

<p>The lad was afraid the one before him meant to act according
to the instincts of his nature, and he retreated more rapidly,
until all at once he whirled about and ran for dear life, directly
toward the highway.</p>

<p>He did not shout, though, if he had seen any other person, he
would have called for help; but, when he reached the road, he
cast a glance over his shoulder, expecting to feel the horrible
claws at the same instant.</p>

<p>The lion was invisible. Fred could scarcely believe his eyes;
but such was the fact.</p>

<p>"I don't understand him," was the conclusion of the boy, who
kept moving further away, scarcely daring to believe in his own
escape even for a few brief minutes.</p>

<p>Fred had been too thoroughly scared to wish to meet the lion
again, but he wanted to get back to the house that the Misses
Perkinpine could be told of the new danger which threatened them.</p>

<p>"I think they'll be more likely to believe me than night before
last," said the lad to himself.</p>

<p>But nothing could tempt him to venture along the lane again after
such an experience.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to reach the house by a long detour, but the
half belief that the lion was lurking in the vicinity made the
effort anything but assuring.</p>

<p>However, Fred Sheldon thought it his duty to let his good friends
know the new peril to which they were subject, in the event of
venturing out of doors.</p>

<p>So slow and stealthy was his next approach to the building that
nearly an hour passed before he found himself in the small yard
surrounding the house; but, when once there, he hastened to the
front door and gave such a resounding knock with the old-fashioned
brass knocker that it could have been heard a long distance away,
on the still summer night.</p>

<p>It seemed a good while to Fred before the bolt was withdrawn,
and Aunt Annie appeared in her cap and spectacles.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, Fred, is it?" she exclaimed with pleasure, when
she recognized the young man who was so welcome at all times.
"You are so late that we had given you up, and were going to retire."</p>

<p>"I started early enough, but it seems to me as if every sort
of awful thing is after us," replied Fred, as he hastily followed
the lady into the dining-room, where the sisters began preparing
the meal for which the visitor, like all urchins of his age, was
ready at any time.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now, Freddy?" asked Aunt Lizzie.</p>

<p>"Why, you had a tramp after you night before last, and now you've
got a big, roaring lion."</p>

<p>"A what?" asked the two in amazement, for they had not heard
a syllable of the exciting incident of the day before.</p>

<p>"Why, there's a lion that broke out of the menagerie yesterday,
and they haven't been able to catch him yet."</p>

<p>"Land sakes alive!" gasped Aunt Annie, sinking into a chair and
raising her hands, "what is the world coming to?"</p>

<p>Aunt Lizzie sat down more deliberately, but her pale face and
amazed look showed she was no less agitated.</p>

<p>Fred helped himself to some more of the luscious shortcake and
golden butter and preserves, and feeling the importance of his
position told the story with which our readers are familiar, though
it must be confessed the lad exaggerated somewhat, as perhaps
was slightly excusable under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Still it was not right for him to describe the lion as of the
size of an ordinary elephant, unless he referred to the baby elephant,
which had never been seen in this country at that time.</p>

<p>Nor should he have pictured his run down the lane, with the beast
behind him all the way, snapping at his head, while Fred only
saved himself by his dexterity in dodging him.</p>

<p>There was scarcely any excuse for such hyperbole, though the
narrative was implicitly believed by the ladies, who felt they
were in greater danger than if a score of burglarious tramps were
planning to rob them.</p>

<p>"They've offered one hundred dollars to any one who catches the
lion without hurting him," added Fred, as well as he could speak
with his mouth filled with spongy gingerbread.</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars!" exclaimed Aunt Lizzie; "why, he'll kill
anybody who goes near him. If I were a man I wouldn't try to capture
him for a million dollars."</p>

<p>"I'm going to try to catch him," said Fred, in his off-hand fashion,
as though it was a small matter, and then, swallowing enough of
the sweet food to allow him to speak more plainly, he added:</p>

<p>"Lions ain't of much account when you get used to 'em; I'm beginning
to feel as though I'm going to make that hundred dollars."</p>

<p>But the good ladies could not accept this statement as an earnest
one, and they chided their youthful visitor for talking so at
random. Fred thought it best not to insist, and finished his meal
without any further declarations of what he intended to do.</p>

<p>"They've left two persons behind to look after the lion," he
said; "one is named Kincade and the other is Bud Heyland, you
know him&mdash;the son of Michael, your hired man."</p>

<p>"Yes; he called here to-day."</p>

<p>"He did. What for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing in particular; he said he heard we had had our silverware
stolen, and he wanted to tell us how sorry he felt and to ask
whether we had any suspicion of who took it."</p>

<p>"He did, eh?" said Fred, half to himself, with a belief that
he understood the real cause of that call.</p>

<p>"I think Bud is getting to be a much better boy than he used
to be," added Aunt Annie; "he was real sorry for us, and talked
real nice. He said he expected to be at home for two or three
days, though he didn't tell us what for, and he would drop in
to see us."</p>

<p>Master Sheldon made no answer to this, but he "had his thoughts,"
and he kept them to himself.</p>

<p>The hour was quite advanced, for the days were long, so that
the fastenings of the house were looked to with great care, and
Fred went to the same room he had occupied two nights before,
the one immediately preceding having been spent at home, as he
partly expected the return of his mother.</p>

<p>After saying his prayers and extinguishing the light, he walked
to the rear window and looked out on the solemn scene.</p>

<p>Everything was still, but he had stood thus only for a minute
or two, when in the quiet, he detected a peculiar sound, which
puzzled him at first; but as he listened, he learned that it came
from the smoke-house, a small structure near the wood-house.</p>

<p>Like the residence, it was built of old-fashioned Holland brick,
and was as strong as a modern prison cell.</p>

<p>"Somebody is in there stealing meat," was the conclusion of Fred;
"I wonder who it can be."</p>

<p>He listened a moment longer, and then heard the same kind of
growl he had noticed the day before when standing in front of
the lion's cage.</p>

<p>Beyond a doubt the king of beasts was helping himself to such
food as suited him.</p>

<p>In a twinkling Fred Sheldon hurried softly down stairs, cautiously
opened the kitchen door, and looked out and listened.</p>

<p>Yes, he was in there; he could hear him growling and crunching
bones, and evidently enjoying the greatest feast of his life.</p>

<p>"Now, if he don't hear me coming, I'll have him sure," Fred said
to himself, as he began stealing toward the door through which
the lion had passed.</p>
