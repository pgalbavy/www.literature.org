<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>About four o'clock on the following afternoon Mrs. Mortimer's
maid, who had almost finished drying and dressing her mistress'
hair, was called to the door by a persistent knocking, which at
first she had been bidden to disregard.</p>

<p>It was Mortimer's man, desiring to know whether Mrs. Mortimer
could receive Mr. Mortimer at once on matters of importance.</p>

<p>"No," said Leila petulantly. "Tell Mullins to say that I can
not see anybody," and catching a glimpse of the shadowy Mullins
dodging about the dusky corridor: "What is the matter? Is Mr.
Mortimer ill?"</p>

<p>But Mullins could not say what the matter might be, and he went
away, only to return in a few moments bearing a scratchy note
from his master, badly blotted and still wet; and Leila, with
a shrug of resignation, took the blotched scrawl daintily between
thumb and forefinger and unfolded it. Behind her, the maid, twisting
up the masses of dark, fragrant hair, read the note very easily
over her mistress' shoulder. It ran, without preliminaries:</p>

<p>"I'm going to talk to you, whether you like it or not. Do you
understand that? If you want to know what's the matter with me
you'll find out fast enough. Fire that French girl out before
I arrive."</p>

<p>She closed the note thoughtfully, folding and double-folding
it into a thick wad. The ink had come off, discolouring her finger-tips;
she dropped the soiled paper on the floor, and held out her hands,
plump fingers spread. And when the maid had finished removing
the stains and had repolished the pretty hands, her mistress sipped
her chocolate thoughtfully, nibbled a bit of dry toast, then motioned
the maid to take the tray and her departure, leaving her the cup.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mortimer came in, stood a moment blinking
around the room, then dropped into a seat, sullen, inert, the
folds of his chin crowded out on his collar, his heavy abdomen
cradled on his short, thick legs. He had been freshly shaved;
linen and clothing were spotless, yet the man looked unclean.</p>

<p>Save for the network of purple veins in his face, there was no
colour there, none in his lips; even his flabby hands were the
hue of clay.</p>

<p>"Are you ill?" asked his wife coolly.</p>

<p>"No, not very. I've got the jumps. What's that? Tea? Ugh! it's
chocolate. Push it out of sight, will you? I can smell it."</p>

<p>Leila set the delicate cup on a table behind her.</p>

<p>"What time did you return this morning?" she asked, stifling
a yawn.</p>

<p>"I don't know; about five or six. How the devil should I know
what time I came in?"</p>

<p>Sitting there before the mirror of her dresser she stole a second
glance at his marred features in the glass. The loose mouth, the
smeared eyes, the palsy-like tremors that twitched the hands where
they tightened on the arms of his chair, became repulsive to the
verge of fascination. She tried to look away, but could not.</p>

<p>"You had better see Dr. Grisby," she managed to say.</p>

<p>"I'd better see you; that's what I'd better do," he retorted
thickly. "You'll do all the doctoring I want. And I want it, all
right."</p>

<p>"Very well. What is it?"</p>

<p>He passed his swollen hand across his forehead.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he repeated. "It's the limit, this time, if you
want to know. I'm all in."</p>

<p>"Roulette?" raising her eyebrows without interest</p>

<p>"Yes, roulette, too. Everything! They got me upstairs at Burbank's.
The game's crooked! Every box, every case, every wheel, every
pack is crooked! crooked! crooked, by God!" he burst out in a
fever, struggling to sit upright, his hands always tightening
on the arms of the chair. "It's nothing but a creeping joint,
run by a bunch of hand-shakers! I &mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stuttering, choking, stammering imprecations, his hoarse clamour
died away after a while. She sat there, head bent, silent, impassive,
acquiescent under the physical and mental strain to which she
had never become thoroughly hardened. How many such scenes had
she witnessed! She could not count them. They differed very little
in detail, and not at all in their ultimate object, which was
to get what money she had. This was his method of reimbursing
himself for his losses.</p>

<p>He made an end to his outburst after a while. Only his dreadful
fat breathing now filled the silence; and supposing he had finished,
she found her voice with an effort:</p>

<p>"I am sorry. It comes at a bad time, as you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A bad time!" he broke out violently. "How can it come at any
other sort of time? With us, all times are bad. If this is worse
than the average it can't be helped. We are in it for keeps this
time!"</p>

<p>"We?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we!" he repeated; but his face had grown ghastly, and his
uncertain eyes were fastened on her's in the mirror.</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;exactly?" she asked, turning from the dresser
to confront him.</p>

<p>He made no effort to answer; an expression of dull fright was
growing on his visage, as though for the first time he had begun
to realise what had happened.</p>

<p>She saw it, and her heart quickened, but she spoke disdainfully:
"Well, I am ready to listen&mdash;as usual. How much do you want?"</p>

<p>He made no sign; his lower lip hung loose; his eyes blinked at
her.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she repeated. "What have you been doing? How much
have you lost? You can't have lost very much; we hadn't much to
lose. If you have given your note to any of those gamblers, it
is a shame&mdash;a shame! Leroy, look at me! You promised me, on your
honour, never to do that again. Have you lied, after all the times
I have helped you out, stripped myself, denied myself, put off
tradesmen, faced down creditors? After all I have done, do you
dare come here and ask for more&mdash;ask for what I have not got&mdash;with
not one bill settled, not one servant paid since December&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leila, I &mdash;I've got&mdash;to tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" she demanded, appalled by the change in his face. If
he was overdoing it, he was overdoing it realistically enough.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I've used Plank's cheque!" he mumbled, and moistened
his lips with his tongue.</p>

<p>She stared back at him, striving to comprehend. "Plank's!" she
repeated slowly, "Plank's cheque? What cheque? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The one he gave you last night. I've used that. Now you know!"</p>

<p>"The one he &mdash;But you couldn't! How could you? It was not
filled in."</p>

<p>"I filled it."</p>

<p>Her dawning horror was reacting on him, as it always did, like
a fierce tonic; and his own courage came back in a sort of sullen
desperation.</p>

<p>"You … You are trying to frighten me, Leroy," she stammered.
"You are trying to make me do something&mdash;give you what you want&mdash;force
me to give you what you want! You can't frighten me. The cheque
was made out to me&mdash;to my order. How could you have used it, if
I had not indorsed it?"</p>

<p>"I indorsed it. Do you understand that!" he said savagely.</p>

<p>"No, I don't; because, if you did, it's forgery."</p>

<p>"I don't give a damn what you think it is!" he broke in fiercely.
"All I'm worried over is what Plank will think. I didn't mean
to do it; I didn't dream of doing it; but when Burbank cleaned
me up I fished about, and that cursed cheque came tumbling out!"</p>

<p>In the rising excitement of self-defence the colour was coming
back into his battered face; he sat up straighter in his chair,
and, grasping the upholstered arms, leaned forward, speaking more
distinctly and with increasing vigour and anger:</p>

<p>"When I saw that cheque in my hands I thought I'd use it temporarily&mdash;merely
as moral collateral to flash at Burbank&mdash;something to back my
I. O. U.'s. So I filled it in."</p>

<p>"For how much?" she asked, not daring to believe him; but he
ignored the question and went on: "I filled it and indorsed it,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How could you indorse it?" she interrupted coolly, now unconvinced
again and suspicious.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you if you'll stop that fool tongue a moment. The
cheque was made to 'L. Mortimer,' wasn't it? So I wrote 'L. Mortimer'
on the back. Now do you know? If you are L. Mortimer, so am I.
Leila begins with L; so does Leroy, doesn't it? I didn't imitate
your two-words-to-a-page autograph. I put my own fist to a cheque
made out to one L. Mortimer; and I don't care what you think about
it as long as Plank can stand it. Now put up your nose and howl,
if you like."</p>

<p>But under her sudden pallor he was taking fright again, and he
began to bolster up his courage with bluster and noise, as usual:</p>

<p>"Howl all you like!" he jeered. "It won't alter matters or square
accounts with Plank. What are you staring at? Do you suppose I'm
not sorry? Do you fancy I don't know what a fool I've been? What
are you turning white for? What in hell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How much have you&mdash;" She choked, then, resolutely: "How much
have you&mdash;taken?"</p>

<p>"Taken!" he broke out, with an oath. "What do you mean? I've
borrowed about twenty thousand dollars. Now yelp! Eh? What?&mdash;no
yelps? Probably some weeps, then. Turn 'em on and run dry; I'll
wait." And he managed to cross one bulky leg over the other and
lean back, affecting resignation, while Leila, bolt upright in
her low chair, every curved outline rigid under the flowing, silken
wrap, stared at him as though stunned.</p>

<p>"Well, we're good for it, aren't we?" he said threateningly.
"If he's going to turn ugly about it, here's the house."</p>

<p>"My&mdash;house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your house! I suppose you'd rather raise something on the
house than have the thing come out in the papers."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" she asked, staring into his bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I'm damn sure of it!"</p>

<p>"You are wrong."</p>

<p>"You mean that you are not inclined to stand by me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean that."</p>

<p>"You don't intend to help me out?"</p>

<p>"I do not intend to&mdash;not this time."</p>

<p>He began to show his big teeth, and that nervous snickering "tick" 
twitched his upper lip.</p>

<p>"How about the courts?" he sneered. "Do you want to figure in
them with Plank?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to," she said steadily, "but you can not frighten
me any more by that threat."</p>

<p>"Oh! Can't frighten you! Perhaps you think you'll marry Plank
when I get a decree? Do you? Well, you won't for several reasons;
first, because I'll name other corespondents and that will make
Plank sick; second, because Plank wants to marry somebody else
and I'm able to assist him. So where do you come out in the shuffle?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, under her breath, and rested her head
against the back of the chair, as though suddenly tired.</p>

<p>"Well, I know. You'll come out smirched, and you know it," said
Mortimer, gazing intently at her. "Look here, Leila: I didn't
come here to threaten you. I'm no black-mailer; I'm no criminal.
I'm simply a decent sort of a man, who is pretty badly scared
over what he's done in a moment of temptation. You know I had
no thought of anything except to borrow enough on my I. O. U.'s
to make a killing at Burbank's. I had to show them something big,
so I filled in that cheque, not meaning to use it; and before
I knew it I'd indorsed it, and was plunging against it. Then they
stacked everything on me&mdash;by God, they did! and if I had not been
in the condition I was in I'd have stopped payment. But it was
too late when I realised what I was against. Leila, you know I'm
not a bad man at heart. Can't you help a fellow?"</p>

<p>His manner, completely changed, had become the resentful and
fretful appeal of the victim of plot and circumstance. All the
savage brutality had been eliminated; the sneer, the truculent
attempts to browbeat, the pitiful swagger, the cynical justification,
all were gone. It was really the man himself now, normally scared
and repentant; the frightened, overfed pensioner on his wife's
bounty; not the human beast maddened by fear and dissipation,
half stunned, half panic-stricken, driven by sheer terror into
a rôle which even he shrank from&mdash;had shrunk from all these years.
For, leech and parasite that he was, Mortimer, however much the
dirty acquisition of money might tempt him in theory, had not
yet brought himself to the point of attempting the practice, even
when in sorest straits and bitterest need. He didn't want to do
it; he wished to get along without it, partly because of native
inertia and an aversion to the mental nimbleness that he would
be required to show as a law-breaker, partly because the word
"black-mail" stood for what he did not dare suggest that he had
come to, even to himself. His distaste was genuine; there were
certain things which he didn't want to commit, and extortion was
one of them. He could, at a pinch, lie to his wife, or try to
scare her into giving him money; he could, when necessary, "borrow" 
from such men as Plank; but he had never cheated at cards, and
he had never attempted to black-mail anybody except his wife&mdash;which,
of course, was purely a family matter, and concerned nobody else.</p>

<p>Now he was attempting it again, with more sincerity, energy,
and determination than he ever before had been forced to display.
Even in his most profane violence the rage and panic were only
partly real. He was, it is true, genuinely scared, and horribly
shaken physically, but he had counted on violence, and he stimulated
his own emotions and made them serve him, knowing all the while
that in the reaction his ends would be accomplished, as usual.
This policy of alternately frightening, dragooning, and supplicating
Leila had carried him so far; and though it was true that this
was a more serious situation than he had ever yet faced, he was
convinced that his wife would pull him out somehow; and how that
was to be accomplished he did not very much care, as long as he
was pulled out safely.</p>

<p>"What this household requires," he said, "is economy." He spread
his legs, denting the Aubusson carpet with his boot-heels, and
glanced askance at his wife. "Economy," he repeated, furtively
wetting his lips with a heavily coated tongue; "that's the true
solution; economical administration in domestic matters. Retrenchment,
Leila! retrenchment! Fewer folderols. I've a notion to give up
that farm, and stop trying to breed those damfool sheep. They
cost a thousand apiece, and do you know what I got for those six
I sent to Westbury? Just twelve hundred dollars from Fleetwood&mdash;the
bargaining shopkeeper! Twelve hundred! Think of that! And along
comes Granby and sells a single ram for six thousand plunks!"</p>

<p>Leila's head was lowered. He could not see her expression, but
he had always been confident of his ability to talk himself out
of trouble, so he rambled on in pretence of camaraderie, currying
favour, as he believed, ingratiating himself with the coarse bluntness
that served him among some men, even among some women.</p>

<p>"We'll fix it somehow," he said reassuringly; "don't you worry,
Leila. I've confidence in you, little girl! You've got me out
of sticky messes before, eh? Well, we've weathered a few, haven't
we?"</p>

<p>Even the horrible parody on wedded loyalty left her silent, unmoved,
dark eyes brooding; and he began to grow a little restless and
anxious as his jocularity increased without a movement in either
response or aversion from his wife.</p>

<p>"You needn't be scared, if I'm not," he said reproachfully. "The
house is worth two hundred and fifty thousand, and there's only
fifty on it now. If that fat, Dutch skinflint, Plank, shows his
tusks, we can clap on another fifty." And as she made no sound
or movement in reply: "As far as Plank goes, haven't I done enough
for him to square it? What have we ever got out of him, except
a thousand or two now and then when the cards went against me?
If I took it, it was practically what he owes me. And if he thinks
it's too much&mdash;look here, Leila! I've a trick up my sleeve. I
can make good any time I wish to. I'm in a position to marry that
man to the girl he's mad about&mdash;stark, raving mad."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mortimer slowly raised her head and looked at her husband.</p>

<p>"Leroy, are you mad?"</p>

<p>"I! Not much!" he exclaimed gleefully. "I can make him the husband
of the most-run-after girl in New York&mdash;if I want to. And at the
same time I can puncture the most arrogant, the most cold-blooded,
selfish, purse-proud, inflated nincompoop that ever sat at the
head of a director's table. O-ho! Now you're staring, Leila. I
can do it; I can make good. What are you worrying about? Why,
I've got a hundred ways to square that cheque, and each separate
way is a winner."</p>

<p>He rose, shook out the creases in his trousers, and adjusted
the squat, gold fob which ornamented his protruding waistcoat.</p>

<p>"So you'll fix it, won't you, Leila?" he said, apparently oblivious
that he had expressed himself as able to adjust the matter in
one hundred equally edifying and satisfactory manners.</p>

<p>She did not answer. He lingered a moment at the door, looking
back with an ingratiating leer; but she paid him no attention,
and he took himself off, confident that her sulkiness could not
result in anything unpleasant to anybody except herself.</p>

<p>Nor did it, as far as he could see. The days brought no noticeable
change in his wife's demeanour toward him. Plank, when he met
him, was civil enough, though it did occur to Mortimer that he
saw very little of Plank in these days.</p>

<p>"Ungrateful beggar!" he thought bitterly; "he's toadying to Belwether
now. I can't do anything more for him, so I don't interest him."</p>

<p>And for a while he wore either a truculent, aggrieved air in
Plank's presence, or the meeker demeanour of a martyr, sentimentally
misunderstood, but patient under the affliction.</p>

<p>Then there came a time when he needed money. During the few days
he spent circling tentatively and apprehensively around his wife
he learned enough to know that there was nothing to be had from
her at present. No doubt the money she raised to placate Plank&mdash;if
she had placated him in that fashion&mdash;was a strain on her resources,
whatever those resources were.</p>

<p>One thing was certain: Plank had not remained very long in ignorance
of the cheque drawn against his balance, if indeed, as Mortimer
feared, the bank itself had not communicated with Plank as soon
as the cheque was presented for payment. Therefore Plank must
have been placated by Leila; how, Mortimer was satisfied not to
know.</p>

<p>"Some of these days," he said to himself, "I'll catch her tripping,
and then there'll be a decent division of property, or&mdash;there'll
be a divorce." But, as usual, Mortimer found such practices more
attractive in theory than in execution, and he was really quite
contented to go on as things were going, if somebody would see
that he had some money occasionally.</p>

<p>One of these occasions when he needed it was approaching. He
had made a "killing" at Desmond's, and had used the money to stop
up the more threatening gaps in the tottering financial fabric
known as his "personal accounts." The fabric would hold for a
while, but meantime he needed money to go on with. And Leila evidently
had none. He tried everybody except Plank. He had scarcely the
impudence to go to Plank just yet; but when, completing the vicious
circle, he found his borrowing capacity exhausted, and himself
once more face to face with the only hope, Plank, he sat down
to consider seriously the possibility of the matter.</p>

<p>Of course Plank owed him more than he could ever pay&mdash;the ungrateful
parvenu!&mdash;but what Plank had thought of that cheque transaction
he had never been able to discover.</p>

<p>Somehow or other he must put Plank under fresh obligations; and
that might have been possible had not Leila invaded the ground,
leaving nothing, now that Plank was secure in club life.</p>

<p>Of course the first thing that presented itself to Mortimer's
consideration was the engineering of Plank's matrimonial ambitions.
Clearly the man had not changed. He was always at Sylvia's heels;
he was seen with her in public; he went to the Belwether house
a great deal. No possible doubt but that he was as infatuated
as ever. And Quarrier was going to marry her next November&mdash;that
is, if he, Mortimer, chose to keep silent about a certain midnight
episode at Shotover.</p>

<p>It was his inclination, except in theory, to keep silent, partly
because of his native inertia and unwillingness to go to the physical
and intellectual exertion of being a rascal, partly because he
didn't really want to be a rascal of that sort.</p>

<p>Like a man with premonitions of toothache, who walks down to
the dentist's just to see what the number of the house looks like,
and then walks around the block to think it over, so Mortimer,
suffering from lack of money, walked round and round the central
idea, unable to bring himself to the point.</p>

<p>Several times he called up Quarrier on the 'phone and made appointments
to lunch with him; but these meetings never resulted in anything
except luncheons which Mortimer paid for, and matters were becoming
desperate.</p>

<p>So one day, after having lunched too freely, he sat down and
wrote Plank the following note:</p>

<p>My Dear Beverly: You will remember that I once promised you my
aid in securing what, to you, is the dearest object of your existence.
I have thought, I have pondered, I have given the matter deep
and, I may add without irreverence, prayerful consideration, knowing
that the life's happiness of my closest friend depended on my
judgment and wisdom and intelligence to secure for him the opportunity
to crown his life's work by the acquisition of the brightest jewel
in the diadem of old Manhattan.</p>

<p>"By George! that's wickedly good, though!" chuckled Mortimer,
refreshing himself with his old stand-by, an apple, quartered,
and soaked in very old port. So he sopped his apple and swallowed
it, and picked up his pen again, chary of overdoing it.</p>

<p>All I say to you is, be ready! The time is close at hand when
you may boldly make your avowal. But be ready! All depends upon
the psychological moment. An instant too soon, an instant too
late, and you are lost. And she is lost forever. Remember! Be
faithful; trust in me, and wait. And the instant I say, "Speak!"
pour out your soul, my dear friend, and be certain you are not
pouring it out in vain. L. M.</p>

<p>Writing about "pouring out" made him thirsty, so he fortified
himself several times, and then, sealing the letter, went out
to a letter-box and stood looking at it.</p>

<p>"If I mail it I'm in for it," he muttered. After a while he put
the letter in his pocket and walked on.</p>

<p>"It really doesn't commit me to anything," he reflected at last,
halting before another letter-box. And as he stood there, hesitating,
he glanced up and saw Quarrier entering the Lenox Club. The next
moment he flung up the metal box lid, dropped in his letter, and
followed Quarrier into the club.</p>

<p>Then events tumbled forward almost without a push from him. Quarrier
was alone in a window corner, drinking vichy and milk and glancing
over the afternoon papers. He saw Mortimer, and invited him to
join him; and Mortimer, being thirsty, took champagne.</p>

<p>"I've been trying a new coach," said Quarrier, in his colourless
and rather agreeable voice; and he went on leisurely explaining
the points of the new mail-coach which had been built in Paris
after plans of his own, while Mortimer gulped glass after glass
of chilled wine, which seemed only to make him thirstier. Meantime
he listened, really interested, except that his fleshy head was
too full of alcohol and his own project to contain additional
statistics concerning coaching. Besides, Quarrier, who had never
been over-cordial to him, was more so now&mdash;enough for Mortimer
to venture on a few tentative suggestions of a financial nature;
and though, as usual, Quarrier was not responsive, he did not,
as usual, get up and go away.</p>

<p>A vague hope stirred Mortimer that it might not be beyond his
persuasive tongue to make this chilly, reticent young man into
a friend some day&mdash;a helpful friend. For Mortimer all his life
had trusted to his tongue; and though poorly enough repaid, the
few lingual victories remained in his memory, along with an inexhaustible
vanity and hope; while his countless defeats and the many occasions
on which his tongue had played him false were all forgotten. Besides,
he had been drinking more heavily all day than was his custom.</p>

<p>So Quarrier talked, sparingly, about his new coach, about Billy
Fleetwood's renowned string of hunters, about Ashley Spencer's
new stable and his chances at Saratoga with Roy-a-neh, for which
he had paid a fabulous sum&mdash;the sum and the story probably equally
fabulous.</p>

<p>Mortimer's head was swimming with ideas; he was also talking
a great deal, much more than he had intended; he was saying things
he had not exactly intended to say, either, in just that way.
He realised it, but he went on, unable to stop his own tongue,
the noise of which intoxicated him.</p>

<p>Once or twice he thought Quarrier looked at him rather strangely;
but he would show Quarrier that he was nobody's fool; he'd show
Quarrier that he was a friend, a good, staunch friend; and that
Quarrier had long, long undervalued him. Waves of sentiment spread
through and through him; his affection for Quarrier dampened his
eyes; and still he blabbed on and on, gazing with brimming eyes
upon Quarrier, who sat back silent and attentive as Mortimer circled
and blundered nearer and nearer to the crucial point of his destination.</p>

<p>Midway in one of his linguistic ellipses Quarrier leaned forward
and caught his arm in a grip of steel. Another man had entered
the room. Mortimer, made partly conscious by the pain of Quarrier's
vise-like grip, was sober enough to recognise the impropriety
of his continuing aloud the veiled story he had been constructing
with what he supposed to be a cunning as matchless as it was impenetrable.</p>

<p>Later he found himself upstairs in a private card-room, facing
Quarrier across a table, and still talking and quenching his increasing
thirst. He knew now what he was telling Quarrier; he was unveiling
the parable; he was stripping metaphor from a carefully precise
story. He used Siward's name presently; presently he used Sylvia's
name. A moment later&mdash;or was it an hour? &mdash;Quarrier stopped
him, coldly, without a trace of passion, demanding corroborative
detail. And Mortimer gave it, wagging his head and one fat forefinger
as emphasis.</p>

<p>"You saw that?" repeated Quarrier, deadly white of a sudden.</p>

<p>"Yes; an' I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At three in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes; an' I want&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You saw him enter her room?"</p>

<p>"Yes; an' I wan' tersay thish to you, because I'm your fr'en'.
Don' wan' anny fr'en's mine get fooled on women! See? Thash how
I feel. I respec' the sect! See! Women, lovely women! See? Respec'
sect! Gimme y'han', buzzer&mdash;er&mdash;brother Quar'er! Your m' fr'en';
I'm your fr'en'. I know how it is. Gotter wife m'own. Rotten one.
Stingy! Takes money outter m' pockets. Dam 'stravagant. Ruin me!
… Say, old boy, what about dividend due 'morrow on Orange County
Eclectic&mdash;mean Erlextic&mdash;no!&mdash;mean 'Letric! Damn! &mdash;Wasser
masser tongue?"</p>

<p>Opening his fond and foggy eyes, and finding himself alone in
the card-room, he began to cry; and a little later, attempting
to push the electric button, he fell over a lounge and lay there,
his shirt-front soiled with wine, one fat leg trailing to the
floor; not the ideal position for slumber, perhaps, but what difference
do attitudes and postures and poses make when a gentleman, in
the sacred seclusion of his own club, is wooing the drowsy goddess
with blasts of votive music through his empurpled nose?</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, he was due to dine at the Belwether
house; and when eight o'clock approached, and he had not returned
to dress, Leila called up Sylvia Landis on the telephone:</p>

<p>"My dear, Leroy hasn't returned, and I suppose he's forgotten
about the Bridge. I can bring Mr. Plank, if you like."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Sylvia, adding, "if Mr. Plank is there, may
I speak to him a moment?"</p>

<p>So Leila rose, setting the receiver on the desk, and Plank came
in from the library and settled himself heavily in the chair:</p>

<p>"Did you wish to speak to me, Miss Landis?"</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mr. Plank? Yes; will you dine with us at eight?
Bridge afterward, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"And, Mr. Plank, you had a note from me this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Please disregard it."</p>

<p>"If you wish."</p>

<p>"I do. It is not worth while." And as Plank made no comment,
"I have no further interest in the matter. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"No," said Plank doggedly.</p>

<p>"I have nothing more to say. I am sorry. We dine at eight," concluded
Sylvia hurriedly.</p>

<p>Plank hung up the receiver and sat eyeing it for a while in silence.
Then his jaw began to harden and his under lip protruded, and
he folded his great hands, resting them in front of him on the
edge of the desk, brooding there, with eyes narrowing like a sleepy
giant at prayer.</p>

<p>When Leila entered, in her evening wraps, she found him there,
so immersed in reverie that he failed to hear her; and she stood
a moment at the doorway, smiling to herself, thinking how pleasant
it was to come down ready for the evening and find him there,
as though he belonged where he sat, and was part of the familiar
environment.</p>

<p>Recently she had grown younger in a smooth-skinned, full-lipped
way&mdash;so much younger that it was spoken of. Something girlish
in figure, in spontaneity, in the hesitation of her smile, in
the lack of that hard, brilliant confidence which once characterised
her, had developed; as though she were beginning her début again,
reverting to a softness and charm prematurely checked. Truly,
her youth's discoloured blossom, forced by the pale phantom of
false spring, was refolding to a bud once more; and the harsher
tints of the inclement years were fading.</p>

<p>"Beverly," she said, "I am ready."</p>

<p>Plank stood up, dazed from his reverie, and walked toward her.
His white tie had become disarranged; she raised her hands, halting
him, and pulled it into shape for him, consciously innocent of
the intimacy.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "Do you know how pretty you are this evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I was very happy at my mirror. Do you know, the withered
years seem to be dropping from me like leaves from an autumn sapling.
And I feel young enough to say so poetically. … Did Sylvia try
to flirt with you over the wire?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as usual," he said drily, descending the stairs beside
her.</p>

<p>"And really you don't love her any more?" she queried.</p>

<p>"Scarcely." His voice was low and rather disagreeable, and she
looked up.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what you and Sylvia find to talk about so frequently,
if you're not in love."</p>

<p>But he made no answer; and they drove away to the Belwether house,
a rather wide, old-style mansion of brown stone, with a stoop
dividing its ugly façade, and a series of unnecessary glass doors
blockading the vestibule.</p>

<p>A drawing-room and a reception-room flanked the marble-tiled
hall; behind these the dining-room ran the width of the rear.
It was a typical gentlefolk's house of the worst period of Manhattan,
and Major Belwether belonged in it as fittingly as a melodeon
belongs in a west-side flat. The hall-way was made for such a
man as he to patter through; the velvet-covered stairs were as
peculiarly fitted for him as a runway is for a rabbit; the suave
pink-and-white drawing-room, the discreet, gray reception-room,
the soft, fat rugs, the intricacies of banisters and alcoves and
curtained cubby-holes&mdash;all reflected his personality, all corroborated
the ensemble. It was his habitat, his distinctly, from the pronounced
but meaningless intricacy of the architecture to the studied but
unconvincing tints, like a man who suddenly starts to speak, but
checks himself, realising he has nothing in particular to say.</p>

<p>There were half a dozen people there lounging informally between
the living-room on the second floor and Sylvia's apartments in
the rear&mdash;the residue from a luncheon and Bridge party given that
afternoon by Sylvia to a score or so of card-mad women. A few
of these she had asked to remain for an informal dinner, and a
desperate game later&mdash;the sort of people she knew well enough
to lose to heavily or win from without remorse &mdash;Grace Ferrall,
Marion Page, Agatha Caithness. Trusting to the telephone that
morning, she had secured the Mortimers and Quarrier, failing three
men; and now the party, with Plank as Mortimer's substitute, was
complete, all thorough gamesters&mdash;sex mattering nothing in the
preparation for such a séance.</p>

<p>In Sylvia's boudoir Grace Ferrall and Agatha Caithness sat before
the fire; Sylvia, at the mirror of her dresser, was correcting
the pallor incident to the unbroken dissipation of a brilliant
season; Marion, with her inevitable cigarette, wandered between
Sylvia's quarters and the library, where Quarrier and Major Belwether
were sitting in low-voiced confab.</p>

<p>Leila, greeted gaily from the boudoir, went in. Plank entered
the library, was mauled effusively by the major, returned Quarrier's
firm hand shake, and sat down with an inquiring smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we're out for blood to-night," tittered Major Belwether,
grasping Quarrier's arm humourously and shaking it to emphasise
his words&mdash;a habit that Quarrier thoroughly disliked. "Sylvia
had a lot of women here playing for the season score, so I suggested
she keep the pick of them for dinner, and call in a few choice
ones to make a night of it."</p>

<p>"It's agreeable to me," said Plank, still looking at Quarrier
with the same inquiring expression, which that gentleman presently
chose to understand.</p>

<p>"I haven't had a chance to look into that matter," he said carelessly.
"Some day, when you have time to go over it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have time now," said Plank; "there's nothing to go over; there's
no reason for any secrecy. All I wrote you was that I proposed
to control the stock of Amalgamated Electric and that I wished
your advice in the matter."</p>

<p>"I could not give you any advice off-hand on such an extraordinary
suggestion," returned Quarrier coldly. "If you know where the
stock is, you'll understand."</p>

<p>"Do you mean what it is quoted at, or who owns it?" interrupted
Plank.</p>

<p>"Who owns it. Everybody knows where it has dropped to, I suppose.
Most people know, too, where it is held."</p>

<p>"Yes; I do."</p>

<p>"And who is manipulating it," added Quarrier indifferently.</p>

<p>"Do you mean Harrington's people?"</p>

<p>"I don't mean anybody in particular, Mr. Plank."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Plank, staring, "I was sure you couldn't have meant
Harrington; because," he went on deliberately, "there are other
theories floating about that mysterious pool, one of which I've
proved."</p>

<p>Quarrier looked at him out of his velvety-lidded eyes:</p>

<p>"What have you proved?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, if you'll appoint an interview."</p>

<p>"I'll come too," began Belwether, who had been listening, loose-mouthed
and intent; "we're all in it &mdash;Howard, Kemp Ferrall, and
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Stephen Siward," observed Plank, so quietly that Quarrier
never even raised his eyes to read the stolid face opposite.</p>

<p>Presently he said: "Do you know anybody who can deliver you any
considerable block of Amalgamated Electric at the market figures?"</p>

<p>"I could deliver you several blocks, if you care to bid," said
Plank bluntly.</p>

<p>Belwether grew red, then pale. Quarrier stiffened in his chair,
but his eyes were only sceptical. Plank's under lip had begun
to protrude again; he swung his massive head, looking from Belwether
back to Quarrier:</p>

<p>"Pool or no pool," he continued, "you Amalgamated people will
want to see the stock climb back into the branches from which
somebody shook it out; and I propose to put it there. That is
all I had meant to say to you, Mr. Quarrier. I'm not averse to
saying it here to you, and I do. There's no secrecy about it.
Figure out for yourself how much stock I control, and who let
it go. Settle your family questions and put your house in order;
then invite me to call, and I'll do it. And I have an idea that
we are going to stand on our own legs again, and recover our self-respect
and our fighting capacity; and I rather think we'll stop this
hold-up business, and that our Inter-County friend will let go
the sand-bag and pocket the jimmy, and talk business across the
line-fence."</p>

<p>Quarrier's characteristic pallor was no index to his feelings,
nor was his icy reticence. All hell might be boiling below.</p>

<p>When anybody gave Quarrier a letter to read he took a long time
reading it; but if he was slow he was also minute; he went over
every word again and again, studying, absorbing each letter, each
period, the conformation of every word. And when he ended he had
in his brain a photograph of the letter which he would never forget.</p>

<p>And now, slowly, minutely, methodically, he was going over and
over Plank's words, and his manner of saying them, and their surface
import, and the hidden one, if any.</p>

<p>If Plank had spoken the truth&mdash;and there was no reason to doubt
it &mdash;Plank had quietly acquired a controlling interest in
Amalgamated Electric. That meant treachery in somebody. Who? Probably
Siward, perhaps Belwether. He would not look at the latter just
yet; not for a minute or two. There was time enough to see through
that withered, pink-and-white old fraud. But why had Plank done
this? And why did Plank suspect him of any desire to wreck his
own property? He did suspect him, that was certain.</p>

<p>After a silence, he spoke quietly and without emotion:</p>

<p>"Everybody concerned will be glad to see Amalgamated Electric
declaring dividends. This is a shock to us," he glanced impassively
at the shrunken major, "but a pleasant shock. I think it well
to arrange a meeting as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said Plank, with a manner of closing discussion.
And in his brusque ending of the matter Quarrier detected the
ringing undertone of an authority he never had and never would
endure; and though his pale, composed features betrayed not the
subtlest shade of emotion, he was aware that a new element had
come into his life&mdash;a new force was growing out of nothing to
confront him, an unfamiliar shape loomed vaguely ahead, throwing
its huge distorted shadow across his path. He sensed it with the
instinct of kind for kind, not because Plank's millions meant
anything to him as a force; not because this lumbering, red-faced
meddler had blundered into a family affair where confidence consisted
in joining hands lest a pocket be inadvertently picked; not because
Plank had knocked at the door, expecting treachery to open, and
had found it, but because of the awful simplicity of the man and
his methods.</p>

<p>If Plank suspected him, he must also suspect him of complicity
in the Inter-County grab; he must suspect him of the ruthless
crushing power that corrupts or annihilates opposition, making
a mockery of legislation, a jest of the courts, and an epigram
of a people's indignation.</p>

<p>And yet, in the face of all this, careless, fearless, frank to
the outer verge of stupidity&mdash;which sometimes means the inability
to be afraid&mdash;this man Plank was casually telling him things which
men regard as secrets and as weapons of defence&mdash;was actually
averting him of his peril, and telling him almost contemptuously
to pull up the drawbridge and prepare for siege, instead of rushing
the castle and giving it to the sack.</p>

<p>As Quarrier sat there meditating, his long, white fingers caressing
his soft, pointed beard, Sylvia came in, greeting the men collectively
with a nod, and offering her hand to Plank.</p>

<p>"Dinner is announced," she said; "please go in farm fashion.
Wait!" as Plank, following the major and Quarrier, stood aside
for her to pass. "No, you go ahead, Howard; and you," to the major.</p>

<p>Left for a moment in the room with Plank, she stood listening
to the others descending the stairs; then:</p>

<p>"Have you seen Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Plank.</p>

<p>"Oh! Is he well?"</p>

<p>"Not very."</p>

<p>"Is he well enough to read a letter, and to answer one?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he's well enough in that way."</p>

<p>"I supposed so. That is why I said to you, over the wire, not
to trouble him with my request."</p>

<p>"You mean that I am not to say anything about your offer to buy
the hunter?"</p>

<p>"No. If I make up my mind that I want the horse I'll write him&mdash;perhaps."</p>

<p>Lingering still, she let one hand fall on the banisters, turning
back toward Plank, who was following:</p>

<p>"I understood you to mean that&mdash;that Mr. Siward's financial affairs
were anything but satisfactory?"&mdash;the sweet, trailing, upward
inflection making it a question.</p>

<p>"When did I say that?" demanded Plank.</p>

<p>"Once&mdash;a month ago."</p>

<p>"I didn't," said Plank bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I had inferred it, then, from something you said, or something
you were silent about. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Am I quite wrong, then?" she asked, looking him in the eyes.</p>

<p>And Plank, who never lied, found no answer. Considering him for
a moment in silence, she turned again and descended the stairs.</p>

<p>The dinner was one of those thoroughly well-chosen dinners of
few courses and faultless service suitable for card-players, who
neither care to stuff themselves as a preliminary to a battle
royal, nor to dawdle through courses, eliminating for themselves
what is not good for them. The men drank a light, sound, aromatic
Irish of the major's; the women&mdash;except Marion, who took what
the men took&mdash;used claret sparingly. Coffee was served where they
sat; the men smoking, Agatha and Marion producing their own cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Don't you smoke any more?" asked Grace Ferrall of Leila Mortimer,
and at the smiling negative, "Oh, that perhaps explains it. You're
growing positively radiant, you know. You'll he wearing a braid
and a tuck in your skirt if you go on getting younger."</p>

<p>Leila laughed, colouring up as Plank turned in his chair to look
at her closer.</p>

<p>"No, it won't rub off, Mr. Plank," said Marion coolly, "but mine
will. This," touching a faint spot of colour under her eyes, "is
art."</p>

<p>"Pooh! I'm all art!" said Grace. "Observe, Mr. Plank, that under
this becoming flush are the same old freckles you saw at Shotover."
And she laughed that sweet, careless laugh of an adolescent and
straightened her boyish figure, pretty head held high, adding:
"Kemp won't let me 'improve' myself, or I'd do it."</p>

<p>"You are perfect," said Sylvia, rising from the table, her own
lovely, rounded, youthful figure condoning the exaggeration; "you're
sufficiently sweet as you are. Good people, if you are ready,
we will go through the ceremony of cutting for partners&mdash;unless
otherwise you decide. How say you?"</p>

<p>"I don't care to enter the scramble for a man," cried Grace.
"If it's to choose, I'd as soon choose Marion."</p>

<p>Plank looked at Leila, who laughed.</p>

<p>"All right; choose, then!" said Sylvia. "Howard, you're dying,
of course, to play with me, but you're looking very guiltily at
Agatha."</p>

<p>The major asked Leila at once; so Plank fell to Sylvia, pitted
against Marion and Grace Ferrall.</p>

<p>A few moments later the quiet of the library was broken by the
butler entering with decanters and ice, and glasses that tinkled
frostily.</p>

<p>Play began at table Number One on a passed make of no trumps
by Sylvia, and at the other table on a doubled and redoubled heart
make, which sent a delicate flush into Agatha's face, and drove
the last vestige of lingering thoughtfulness from Quarrier's,
leaving it a tense, pallid, and expressionless mask, out of which
looked the velvet-fringed eyes of a woman.</p>

<p>Of all the faces there at the two tables, Sylvia's alone had
not changed, neither assuming the gambler's mask nor the infatuated
glare of the amateur. She was thoughtful, excited, delighted,
or dismayed by turns, but always wholesomely so; the game for
its own sake, and not the stakes, absorbing her, partly because
she had never permitted herself to weigh money and pleasure in
the same balance, but kept a mental pair of scales for each.</p>

<p>As usual, the fever of gain was fiercest in those who could afford
to lose most. Quarrier, playing to rule with merciless precision,
coldly exacted every penalty that a lapse in his opponents permitted.
Agatha, her teeth set in her nether lip, her eyes like living
jewels, answered Quarrier's every signal, interpreted every sign,
her play fitting in exactly with his, as though she were his subconscious
self balancing the perfectly adjusted mechanism of his body and
mind.</p>

<p>Now and then lifting her eyes, she sent a long, limpid glance
at Quarrier like a pale shaft of light; and under his heavy-fringed
lashes, at moments, his level gaze encountered her's with a slow
narrowing of lids&mdash;as though there was more than one game in progress,
more than one stake being played for under the dull rose glow
of the clustered lights.</p>

<p>Sylvia, sitting dummy at the other tables mechanically alert
to Plank's cards dropping in rapid sequence as he played alternately
from his own hand and the dummy, permitted her thoughtful eyes
to wander toward Agatha from moment to moment. How alluring her
subtle beauty, in its own strange way! How perfect her accord
with her partner! How faultless her intelligence, divining the
very source of every hidden motive controlling him, forestalling
his intent&mdash;acquiescent, delicate, marvellous intelligence&mdash;the
esoteric complement of two parts of a single mind.</p>

<p>The collar of diamonds and aqua marines shimmered like the reflection
of shadowy lightning across her throat; a single splendid jewel
glowed on her left hand as her fingers flashed among the cards
for the make-up.</p>

<p>"A hundred aces," broke in Plank's heavy voice as he played the
last trick and picked up the scoring card and pencil.</p>

<p>Sylvia's blue eyes were laughing as Plank cut the new pack. Marion
Page coolly laid aside her cigarette, dealt, and made it "without"
in the original.</p>

<p>"May I play?" asked Sylvia sweetly.</p>

<p>"Please," growled Plank.</p>

<p>So Sylvia serenely played from the "top of nothing," and Grace
Ferrall whisked a wonderful dummy across the green; and Plank's
thick under lip began to protrude, and he lowered his heavy head
like a bull at bay.</p>

<p>Once Marion, over-intent, touched a card in the dummy when she
should have played from her own hand; and Sylvia would have let
it pass, had not Plank calmly noted the penalty.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! It's too much like business," sighed Sylvia. "Can't
we play for the sake of the sport? I don't think it good sportsmanship
to profit by a blunder."</p>

<p>"Rule," observed Marion laconically. "'Ware barbed wire, if you
want the brush."</p>

<p>"I myself never was crazy for the brush," murmured Sylvia.</p>

<p>Grace whispered maliciously: "But you've got it, with the mask
and pads," and her mischievous head barely tipped backward in
the direction of Quarrier.</p>

<p>"Especially the mask," returned Sylvia, under her breath, and
laid on the table the last card of a Yarborough.</p>

<p>Plank scored without comment. Marion cut, and resumed her cigarette.
Sylvia dealt with that witchery of rounded wrists and slim fingers
fascinating to men and women alike. Then, cards en règle, passed
the make. Plank, cautiously consulting the score, made it spades,
which being doubled, Grace led a "singleton" ace, and Plank slapped
down a strong dummy and folded his great arms.</p>

<p>Toward midnight, Sylvia, absorbed in her dummy, fancied she heard
the electric bell ringing at the front door. Later, having barely
made the odd, she was turning to look at the major, when, beyond
him, she saw Leroy Mortimer enter the room, sullen, pasty-skinned,
but perfectly sober and well groomed.</p>

<p>"You are a trifle late," observed Sylvia carelessly. Grace Ferrall
and Marion ignored him. Plank bade him good evening in a low voice.</p>

<p>The people at the other table, having completed their rubber,
looked around at Mortimer in disagreeable surprise.</p>

<p>"I'll cut in, if you want me. If you don't, say so," observed
Mortimer.</p>

<p>It was plain that they did not; so he settled himself in an arm-chair,
with an ugly glance at his wife and an insolent one at Quarrier;
and the game went on in silence; Leila and the major still losing
heavily under the sneering gaze of Mortimer.</p>

<p>At last, "Who's carrying you?" he broke out, exasperated; and
in the shocked silence Leila, very white, made a movement to rise,
but Quarrier laid his long fingers across her arm, pressing her
backward.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're saying," he remarked, looking coldly
at Mortimer.</p>

<p>Plank laid down his cards, rose, and walked over to Mortimer:</p>

<p>"May I have a word with you?" he asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"You may. And I'll help myself to a word or two with you," retorted
Mortimer, following Plank out of the room, down the stairs to
the lighted reception-room, where they wheeled, confronting one
another.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" demanded Plank. "At the club they told
me you were asleep in the card-room. I didn't tell Leila. What
is wrong?"</p>

<p>"I'm &mdash;I'm dead broke," said Mortimer harshly. "Billy Fleetwood
took my paper. Can you help me out? It's due to-morrow."</p>

<p>Plank looked at him gravely, but made no answer.</p>

<p>"Can you?" repeated Mortimer violently. "Haven't I done enough
for you? Haven't I done enough for everybody? Is anybody going
to show me any consideration? Look at Quarrier's manner to me
just now! And this very day I did him a service that all his millions
can't repay. And there you stand, too, staring at me as though
I were some damned importuning shabby-genteel, hinting around
for an opening to touch you. Yes, you do! And this very day I
have done for you the&mdash;the most vital thing&mdash;the most sacred favour
one man can do for another&mdash;"</p>

<p>He halted, stammered something incoherent, his battered eyes
wet with tears. The man was a wreck&mdash;nerves, stamina, mind on
the very verge of collapse.</p>

<p>"I'll help you, of course," said Plank, eyeing him. "Go home,
now, and sleep. I tell you I'll help you in the morning. … Don't
give way! Have you no grit? Pull up sharp, I tell you!"</p>

<p>But Mortimer had fallen into a chair, his ravaged face cradled
in his hands. "I've got all that's c-coming to me," he said hoarsely;
"I'm all in&mdash;all in! God! but I've got the jumps this trip. …
You'll stand for this, won't you, Plank? I was batty, but I woke
up in time to grasp the live wire Billy Fleetwood held&mdash;three
shocks in succession&mdash;and his were queens full to my jacks&mdash;aces
to kings twice! &mdash;Alderdene and Voucher sitting in until
they'd started me off hiking hellward!"</p>

<p>He began to ramble, and even to laugh weakly, passing his puffy,
shaking hands across his eyes.</p>

<p>"It's good of you, Beverly; I appreciate it. But I've been good
to you. You're all to the good, my boy! Understand? All to the
good. I fixed it; I did it for you. You can have your innings
now. You can have her when you want her, I tell you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Plank menacingly.</p>

<p>"Mean! I mean what I told you that day at Black Fells, when we
were riding. I told you you had a chance to win out. Now the chance
has come&mdash;same's I told you. Start in, and by the time you're
ready to say 'When?' she'll be there with the bottle!"</p>

<p>"I don't think you are perfectly sane yet," said Plank slowly.</p>

<p>"Let it go at that, then," sniggered Mortimer, struggling to
his feet. "Bring Leila back; I'm all in; I'm going home. You'll
be around in the morning, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Plank. "Have you got a cab?"</p>

<p>Mortimer had one. The glass and iron doors clanged behind him,
and Plank, waiting a moment, sighed, raised his head, and, encountering
the curious gaze of a servant, trudged off up-stairs again.</p>

<p>The game had ended at both tables. Quarrier and Agatha stood
by the window together, conversing in low voices. Belwether, at
a desk, sat muttering and fussing with a cheque-book. The others
were in Sylvia's apartments.</p>

<p>A few moments later Kemp Ferrall arrived, in the best of spirits,
very much inclined to consider the night as still young; but his
enthusiasm met with no response, and presently he departed with
his wife and Marion in their big Mercedes, wheeling into the avenue
at a reckless pace, and streaming away through the night like
a meteor run mad.</p>

<p>Leila, in her wraps, emerged in a few moments, looking at Plank
out of serious eyes; and they made their brief adieux and went
away in Plank's brougham.</p>

<p>When Agatha's maid arrived, Quarrier also started to take his
leave; but Sylvia, seated at a card-table, idly arranging the
cards in geometrical designs and fanciful arabesques, looked up
at him, saying:</p>

<p>"I wanted to say something to you, Howard."</p>

<p>Agatha passed them, going into Sylvia's room for her wraps; and
Quarrier turned to Sylvia:</p>

<p>"Well?" he said, with the slightest hint of impatience.</p>

<p>"Can't you stay a minute?" asked Sylvia, surprised.</p>

<p>"Agatha is going in the motor with me. Is it anything important?"</p>

<p>She considered him without replying. She had never before detected
that manner, that hardness in a voice always so even in quality.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he repeated.</p>

<p>She thought a moment, putting aside for the time his manner,
which she could not comprehend; then:</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you a question&mdash;a rather ignorant one, perhaps.
It's about your Amalgamated Electric Company. May I ask it, Howard?"</p>

<p>After a second's stare, "Certainly," he said.</p>

<p>"It's only this: If the other people&mdash;the Inter-County, I mean&mdash;are
slowly ruining Amalgamated, why don't you stop it?"</p>

<p>Quarrier's eyes narrowed. "Oh! And who have you been discussing
the matter with?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Plank," she said simply. "I asked him. He shook his head,
and said I'd better ask you. And I do ask you."</p>

<p>For a moment he stood mute; then his lips began to shrink back
over his beautiful teeth in one of his rare laughs.</p>

<p>"I'll be very glad to explain it some day," he said; but there
was no mirth in his voice or eyes, only the snickering lip wrinkling
the pallor.</p>

<p>"Will you not answer now?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, not now. But I desire you to understand it some day&mdash;some
day before November. And one or two other matters that it is necessary
for you to understand. I want to explain them, Sylvia, in such
a manner that you will never be likely to forget them. And I mean
to; for they are never out of my mind, and I wish them to be as
ineffaceably impressed on yours. … Good night."</p>

<p>He took her limp hand almost briskly, released it, and stepped
down the stairs as Agatha entered, cloaked, to say good night.</p>

<p>They kissed at parting&mdash;"life embracing death"&mdash;as Mortimer had
sneered on a similar occasion; then Sylvia, alone, stood in her
bedroom, hands linked behind her, her lovely head bent, groping
with the very ghosts of thought which eluded her, fleeing, vanishing,
reappearing, to peep out at her only to fade into nothing ere
she could follow where they flitted through the dark labyrinths
of memory.</p>

<p>The major, craning his neck in the bay-window, saw Agatha and
Quarrier enter the big, yellow motor, and disappear behind the
limousine. And it worried him horribly, because he knew perfectly
well that Quarrier had lied to him about a jewelled collar precisely
like the collar worn by Agatha Caithness; and what to do or what
to say to anybody on the subject was, for the first time in his
life, utterly beyond his garrulous ability. So, for the first
time also in his chattering career, he held his tongue, reassured
at moments, at other moments panic-stricken lest this marriage
he had engineered should go amiss, and his ambitions be nipped
at the very instant of triumphant maturity.</p>

<p>"This sort of thing&mdash;in your own caste&mdash;among your own kind,"
his panicky thoughts ran on, "is b-bad form&mdash;rotten bad taste
on both sides. If they were married&mdash;one of them, anyway! But
this isn't right; no, by gad! it's bad taste, and no gentleman
could countenance it!"</p>

<p>It was plain that he could, however, his only fear being that
somebody might whisper something to turn Sylvia's innocence into
a terrible wisdom which would ruin everything, and knock the underpinning
from the new tower which his inflated fancy beheld slowly growing
heavenward, surmounting the house of Belwether.</p>

<p>Another matter: he had violated his word, and had been caught
at it by his prospective nephew-in-law&mdash;broken his pledged word
not to sell his Amalgamated Electric holdings, and had done it.
Yet, how could Plank dominate, unless another also had done what
he had done? And it made him a little more comfortable to know
he was sharing the fault with somebody&mdash;probably with Siward,
whom he now had the luxury of despising for the very thing he
himself had done.</p>

<p>"Drunkard!" he muttered to himself; "he's in the gutter at last!"</p>

<p>And he repeated it unctuously, almost reconciled to his own shortcoming,
because it was the first time, as far as he knew, that a Belwether
might legitimately enjoy the pleasures of holding the word of
a Siward in contempt.</p>

<p>Sylvia had dismissed her maid, the old feeling of distaste for
the touch of another had returned since the last mad, crushed
embrace in Siward's arms had become a memory. More and more she
was returning to old instincts, old habits of thought, reverting
to type once more, virgin of lip and thought and desire, save
when the old memory stopped her heart suddenly, then sent it racing,
touching her face with quick, crimson imprint.</p>

<p>Now, blue eyes dreaming under the bright masses of her loosened
hair, she sat watching the last glimmer amid the ashes whitening
on the hearth, thinking of Siward and of what had been between
them, and of what could never be&mdash;never, never be.</p>

<p>One red spark among the ashes&mdash;her ambition, deathless amid the
ashes of life! When that, too, went out, life must be extinct.</p>

<p>What he had roused in her had died when he went away. It could
never awake again, unless he returned to awaken it. And he never
would; he would never come again.</p>

<p>One brief interlude of love, of passion, in her life could neither
tint nor taint the cool, normal sequence of her days. All that
life held for a woman of her caste&mdash;all save that&mdash;was hers when
she stretched out her hand for it&mdash;hers by right of succession,
of descent; hers by warrant unquestioned, by the unuttered text
of the ukase to be launched, if necessary, by that very, very
old lady, drowsing, enthroned, as the endless pageant wound like
a jewelled river at her feet.</p>

<p>So Siward could never come again, sauntering toward her through
the sunlight, smiling his absent smile. She caught her breath
painfully, straightening up; a single ash fell in the fire; the
last spark went out.</p>
