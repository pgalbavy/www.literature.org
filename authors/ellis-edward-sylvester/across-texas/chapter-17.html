<p><em>HERBERT </em>held his field glass to his eyes for several
minutes, while he carefully studied the group of horsemen out
upon the plain. There were four of them, beside the two pack animals,
all apparently well mounted, and the clear sunlight brought them
into clear relief. Their ponies were walking slowly, not exactly
north, but bearing a little to the west, so that the general direction
was the same as that of our friends on their way to New Mexico.</p>

<p>The horseman on the right was Nick Ribsam. Although the distance
was too great to distinguish his features, the presence of the
pack horses settled the question and there was no mistaking his
personality: it was he beyond all doubt.</p>

<p>"What can be the explanation of his presence with them?" was
the question which the alarmed Herbert asked himself, as he lowered
his glass and gazed absently in the direction, while he studied
the most perplexing problem that had yet presented itself.</p>

<p>He was impressed by the fact that there were three horsemen besides
his friend. That was the number that made up the band of Bell
Rickard. What more likely than that the three with Nick were the
horse thieves?</p>

<p>In the hours that had passed since they were seen, far out on
the plains to the eastward, they possessed sufficient time to
make their way through the hills to this point. Indeed, they could
have done so after the sounds of firing ceased on the other side
of the hills.</p>

<p>But this theory of necessity raised other perplexing questions.
If those three men were the criminals, where were Strubell and
Lattin? Where had they been, while the piece of treachery was
pushed to a conclusion? Was it supposable that they had remained
idle and permitted Nick’s most dangerous enemy to get him in his
power?</p>

<p>Certainly not—<em>provided it was in their power to prevent it</em>.</p>

<p>The inference could not be escaped by Herbert that the cowboys
had been put out of the way by their enemies, and that, therefore,
no further help was to be expected from them.</p>

<p>Other questions presented themselves, which would have puzzled
a more experienced frontiersman than the young New Yorker.</p>

<p>He and Nick had discovered a second camp fire the afternoon before,
to the northward. Who kindled that, and what was its significance?
Evidently it had some connection with the Texans or the criminals,
but nothing could be learned to indicate its nature.</p>

<p>Were the continued absence and silence of the cowboys explainable
on any other theory than their own overthrow?</p>

<p>These questions, however, were put out of sight by the personal
peril of Nick Ribsam, and the anxiety of Herbert to do something
for him without delay.</p>

<p>His first inclination was to gallop back over the trail to the
point where he left Strubell and Lattin the afternoon before,
and tell them what had taken place. They were the only ones of
whom aid could reasonably be expected.</p>

<p>But it has been shown that he feared the worst concerning them.
Time was precious, and to cross the ridge and return would take
a half hour, which might be fatal to any other step toward helping
Nick. This fear was intensified by the discovery that the walk
of the ponies to the westward had become a gallop, which was fast
widening the gap between them and the ridge, where the distressed
Herbert was trying to settle what he ought to do, if indeed he
could do anything, for his loved friend.</p>

<p>"I will follow them," was the conclusion which he reached after
briefly thinking over every phase of the question; "I don’t know
that it will do Nick any good, but it’s just what <em>he</em>
would do if our situations were changed."</p>

<p>Herbert was well aware that in making this important decision,
the only possible hope—and it was slight indeed—of doing anything
for Nick was by using the utmost discretion.</p>

<p>One might well ask what chance he could have against three veteran
plainsmen, who were without principle or honor. Had Herbert himself
been asked the question, he would have found it hard to answer.
It may be said that something in the nature of a ransom suggested
itself, though he was too wise to build much hope on that means.</p>

<p>The one thing clear in his mind was that he must hide his pursuit,
if he could do so, from all knowledge of the abductors. If they
possessed a field glass, as he believed was likely, they must
have discerned him at the foot of the hills, provided the instrument
was turned in that direction. Hopeful, however, that they had
not done so, he drew his pony behind a sheltering rock, and held
his gaze fixed on the horsemen, who maintained their gallop, which
was fast taking them out of his natural field of vision.</p>

<p>He waited until the fluttering specks were barely perceptible
to the unassisted eye, and then decided to follow the trail a
little way to the southward, before wheeling to the west. He thought
it less likely that he would be noticed, if he left the hills
at a point removed from where he had been waiting so long, and
where, had the criminals observed him, they would look for his
reappearance.</p>

<p>He had ridden no more than a hundred yards, when, to his astonishment,
he came upon the site of the strangers’ last encampment. It was
directly beside the trail, where there was no water, but the smouldering
camp fire and the cropped grass showed that several hours had
been passed there. More important than all to the solitary pursuer
was the finding of the remains of an antelope that had furnished
the party with a meal. The youth had not eaten food since the
preceding noon, and, highly wrought as were his feelings, he was
faint and in need of nourishment. Enough fragments were scattered
about for him to obtain all he wanted in that line, so long as
he was not over fastidious.</p>

<p>Since he was hungry and there was no saying when he could secure
another meal, Herbert was wise in eating his fill. Then, when
he swung himself into the saddle, he looked across the plain and
failed to see the horsemen; but the glass, being brought into
play, revealed them apparently in the very rim of the horizon.</p>

<p>"Ah, they have changed their course!" he exclaimed; "that looks
as if they had no instrument after all and think I am beyond their
sight."</p>

<p>It will be remembered that beyond the level stretch of country,
another and loftier range of hills showed against the clear sky.
The horsemen were moving toward them, and Herbert believed it
was with the purpose of misleading him or anyone that undertook
to follow them. True, the trail left by them was so marked that,
once taken, it could be maintained without trouble to the end;
but, for reasons already shown, they were warranted in considering
that improbable.</p>

<p>The pursuer, however, decided to take no chances that he could
avoid. Having started from the encampment of the preceding night,
he was on their track from the beginning, and he meant to maintain
it to the end.</p>

<p>Everyone knows how deceptive distance is in the clear air of
the plains. Objects that appear but a few miles away prove to
be two and three times as far. Herbert Watrous had been long enough
in Texas to learn this fact. The range that he had noticed the
afternoon before seemed to be within half a day’s ride, but he
was convinced it would require brisk traveling to reach it by
sunset.</p>

<p>Then, too, the plan he had fixed upon forced him to keep a long
way to the rear, so that, if the horsemen struck the other range
by set of sun, the night would be well along before he could come
up with them. There was no moon to help him, and this might interfere
with his programme.</p>

<p>But, as may be said, he had put his hand to the plough and did
not look back.</p>

<p>Contrary, however, to the maxim, this was an unfortunate mistake
on his part; for, had he, after riding the major part of the distance,
turned in his saddle and surveyed the course traversed, he would
have made an important discovery, and one, too, that must have
had an important bearing on the almost hopeless enterprise in
which he was engaged.</p>

<p>But Herbert’s interest was all in front. Nick Ribsam was in the
power of his enemies, and possibly he could aid him, though common
sense told him that the chances were as ninety-nine to one that
he would end the business by putting himself in the same hole.
A party of desperate men that were cunning enough to make the
sagacious Nick prisoner were not likely to be annoyed by anything
Herbert Watrous could do to checkmate them; but youth is ardent
and hopeful, and none of these things weakened the pursuit of
the New Yorker.</p>
