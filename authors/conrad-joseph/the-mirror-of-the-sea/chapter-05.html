<p> From first to last the seaman’s thoughts are very much concerned
with his anchors.  It is not so much that the anchor is a symbol
of hope as that it is the heaviest object that he has to handle
on board his ship at sea in the usual routine of his duties. 
The beginning and the end of every passage are marked distinctly
by work about the ship’s anchors.  A vessel in the Channel has
her anchors always ready, her cables shackled on, and the land
almost always in sight.  The anchor and the land are indissolubly
connected in a sailor’s thoughts.  But directly she is clear of
the narrow seas, heading out into the world with nothing solid
to speak of between her and the South Pole, the anchors are got
in and the cables disappear from the deck.  But the anchors do
not disappear. Technically speaking, they are "secured in-board";
and, on the forecastle head, lashed down to ring-bolts with ropes
and chains, under the straining sheets of the head-sails, they
look very idle and as if asleep. Thus bound, but carefully looked
after, inert and powerful, those emblems of hope make company
for the look-out man in the night watches; and so the days glide
by, with a long rest for those characteristically shaped pieces
of iron, reposing forward, visible from almost every part of the
ship’s deck, waiting for their work on the other side of the world
somewhere, while the ship carries them on with a great rush and
splutter of foam underneath, and the sprays of the open sea rust
their heavy limbs.</p>

<p>The first approach to the land, as yet invisible to the crew’s
eyes, is announced by the brisk order of the chief mate to the
boatswain: "We will get the anchors over this afternoon" or "first
thing to-morrow morning," as the case may be.  For the chief mate
is the keeper of the ship’s anchors and the guardian of her cable. 
There are good ships and bad ships, comfortable ships and ships
where, from first day to last of the voyage, there is no rest
for a chief mate’s body and soul.  And ships are what men make
them: this is a pronouncement of sailor wisdom, and, no doubt,
in the main it is true.</p>

<p>However, there are ships where, as an old grizzled mate once
told me, "nothing ever seems to go right!"  And, looking from
the poop where we both stood (I had paid him a neighbourly call
in dock), he added: "She’s one of them."  He glanced up at my
face, which expressed a proper professional sympathy, and set
me right in my natural surmise: "Oh no; the old man’s right enough. 
He never interferes.  Anything that’s done in a seamanlike way
is good enough for him.  And yet, somehow, nothing ever seems
to go right in this ship.  I tell you what: she is naturally unhandy."</p>

<p>The "old man," of course, was his captain, who just then came
on deck in a silk hat and brown overcoat, and, with a civil nod
to us, went ashore. He was certainly not more than thirty, and
the elderly mate, with a murmur to me of "That’s my old man,"
proceeded to give instances of the natural unhandiness of the
ship in a sort of deprecatory tone, as if to say, "You mustn’t
think I bear a grudge against her for that."</p>

<p>The instances do not matter.  The point is that there are ships
where things <em>do</em> go wrong; but whatever the ship—good
or bad, lucky or unlucky—it is in the forepart of her that her
chief mate feels most at home.  It is emphatically <em>his</em>
end of the ship, though, of course, he is the executive supervisor
of the whole.  There are <em>his</em> anchors, <em>his</em> headgear,
his foremast, his station for manoeuvring when the captain is
in charge.  And there, too, live the men, the ship’s hands, whom
it is his duty to keep employed, fair weather or foul, for the
ship’s welfare. It is the chief mate, the only figure of the ship’s
afterguard, who comes bustling forward at the cry of "All hands
on deck!"  He is the satrap of that province in the autocratic
realm of the ship, and more personally responsible for anything
that may happen there.</p>

<p>There, too, on the approach to the land, assisted by the boatswain
and the carpenter, he "gets the anchors over" with the men of
his own watch, whom he knows better than the others.  There he
sees the cable ranged, the windlass disconnected, the compressors
opened; and there, after giving his own last order, "Stand clear
of the cable!" he waits attentive, in a silent ship that forges
slowly ahead towards her picked-out berth, for the sharp shout
from aft, "Let go!"  Instantly bending over, he sees the trusty
iron fall with a heavy plunge under his eyes, which watch and
note whether it has gone clear.</p>

<p>For the anchor "to go clear" means to go clear of its own chain. 
Your anchor must drop from the bow of your ship with no turn of
cable on any of its limbs, else you would be riding to a foul
anchor.  Unless the pull of the cable is fair on the ring, no
anchor can be trusted even on the best of holding ground.  In
time of stress it is bound to drag, for implements and men must
be treated fairly to give you the "virtue" which is in them. 
The anchor is an emblem of hope, but a foul anchor is worse than
the most fallacious of false hopes that ever lured men or nations
into a sense of security.  And the sense of security, even the
most warranted, is a bad councillor.  It is the sense which, like
that exaggerated feeling of well-being ominous of the coming on
of madness, precedes the swift fall of disaster.  A seaman labouring
under an undue sense of security becomes at once worth hardly
half his salt.  Therefore, of all my chief officers, the one I
trusted most was a man called B—.  He had a red moustache, a lean
face, also red, and an uneasy eye.  He was worth all his salt.</p>

<p>On examining now, after many years, the residue of the feeling
which was the outcome of the contact of our personalities, I discover,
without much surprise, a certain flavour of dislike.  Upon the
whole, I think he was one of the most uncomfortable shipmates
possible for a young commander. If it is permissible to criticise
the absent, I should say he had a little too much of the sense
of insecurity which is so invaluable in a seaman.  He had an extremely
disturbing air of being everlastingly ready (even when seated
at table at my right hand before a plate of salt beef) to grapple
with some impending calamity.  I must hasten to add that he had
also the other qualification necessary to make a trustworthy seaman—that
of an absolute confidence in himself.  What was really wrong with
him was that he had these qualities in an unrestful degree.  His
eternally watchful demeanour, his jerky, nervous talk, even his,
as it were, determined silences, seemed to imply—and, I believe,
they did imply—that to his mind the ship was never safe in my
hands.  Such was the man who looked after the anchors of a less
than five-hundred-ton barque, my first command, now gone from
the face of the earth, but sure of a tenderly remembered existence
as long as I live.  No anchor could have gone down foul under
Mr. B—’s piercing eye.  It was good for one to be sure of that
when, in an open roadstead, one heard in the cabin the wind pipe
up; but still, there were moments when I detested Mr. B— exceedingly. 
From the way he used to glare sometimes, I fancy that more than
once he paid me back with interest.  It so happened that we both
loved the little barque very much.  And it was just the defect
of Mr. B—’s inestimable qualities that he would never persuade
himself to believe that the ship was safe in my hands.  To begin
with, he was more than five years older than myself at a time
of life when five years really do count, I being twenty-nine and
he thirty-four; then, on our first leaving port (I don’t see why
I should make a secret of the fact that it was Bangkok), a bit
of manoeuvring of mine amongst the islands of the Gulf of Siam
had given him an unforgettable scare.  Ever since then he had
nursed in secret a bitter idea of my utter recklessness.  But
upon the whole, and unless the grip of a man’s hand at parting
means nothing whatever, I conclude that we did like each other
at the end of two years and three months well enough.</p>

<p>The bond between us was the ship; and therein a ship, though
she has female attributes and is loved very unreasonably, is different
from a woman.  That I should have been tremendously smitten with
my first command is nothing to wonder at, but I suppose I must
admit that Mr. B—’s sentiment was of a higher order.  Each of
us, of course, was extremely anxious about the good appearance
of the beloved object; and, though I was the one to glean compliments
ashore, B— had the more intimate pride of feeling, resembling
that of a devoted handmaiden.  And that sort of faithful and proud
devotion went so far as to make him go about flicking the dust
off the varnished teak-wood rail of the little craft with a silk
pocket-handkerchief—a present from Mrs. B—, I believe.</p>

<p>That was the effect of his love for the barque.  The effect of
his admirable lack of the sense of security once went so far as
to make him remark to me: "Well, sir, you <em>are</em> a lucky
man!"</p>

<p>It was said in a tone full of significance, but not exactly offensive,
and it was, I suppose, my innate tact that prevented my asking,
"What on earth do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>Later on his meaning was illustrated more fully on a dark night
in a tight corner during a dead on-shore gale.  I had called him
up on deck to help me consider our extremely unpleasant situation. 
There was not much time for deep thinking, and his summing-up
was: "It looks pretty bad, whichever we try; but, then, sir, you
always do get out of a mess somehow."</p>
