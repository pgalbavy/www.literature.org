<p>The hair needs little attention. A boy should not wear it long
and it should be carefully combed and brushed. Girls who let theirs
grow longer should have it frequently clipped, as it gives it
vigor.</p>

<p>Never put oil or grease on the hair, for it catches and holds
the dirt in the air, soils clothing, clogs the pores at the roots,
and tends to produce baldness.</p>

<p>If you will brush your hair vigorously for several minutes every
morning, it will soon acquire a gloss and look better than if
smeared with pomatum. The odor will be pleasant and the hair will
not ruin articles and clothing with which it comes in contact.
Now and then it is well to clean the hair with Castile soap, warm
water and a strong brush. Shampooing is excellent.</p>

<p>Hair is a non-conductor of heat,—that is, very little heat or
cold can be made to pass through it. It serves as a protection
to the brain. While a great many men are baldheaded, you very
rarely see a woman thus afflicted. This is because they do not
wear air-tight coverings for their heads, but the scalp is kept
cool and healthy. It is a good thing for children to leave off
their hats and caps, except when necessary to protect them out-of-doors.</p>

<em>THE EAR</em>.

=<em>THE EAR.=—</em><em>Showing External Ear and Internal Ear.</em> (1) <em>Auditory<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Canal</em>, (2) <em>Drum of the Ear</em>, (3, 4, 5, 6) <em>Bones of the Ear</em>, (7,<br/>

<p>The ears need even less care than the hair, for that which is
called by the name, is only the covering of the true ear. Every
boy and girl will make sure that when the face and hands are washed,
the neck and ears are not forgotten. The shape of the outer ear
causes it to catch many of the particles always floating in the
air. These can be easily removed with the end of the forefinger,
covered by a portion of a moist towel.</p>

<p>Do not pick the ears. The wax is placed there by nature for a
wise purpose. It keeps out dirt and insects and protects from
injury the delicate organs of the true ear within. If the wax
becomes too abundant or hard, it can be easily removed with the
forefinger. If anything more is required, go to a doctor.</p>

<em>THE EYE</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The eye is the most wonderful organ of the body, and with simple
care can be preserved all through life. Boys and girls who have
bright, strong eyes are apt to weaken them by carelessness in
their use.</p>

<p>[Illustration:</p>

<p>You should never apply water, either warm or cold, to the eyeball.
When washing your face, keep your eyes closed, but wash the corners
and outer surface. The gummy substance which sometimes collects
is thus removed without trouble. It is well sometimes to close
the eyes and rub them briskly, just as we feel like doing on awaking
from sleep.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>HOW TO USE THE EYES</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Never strain the eyes by trying to read or examine anything closely
when the light is poor. When it becomes an effort to see distinctly,
cease the effort at once. A strong glare of light is also hurtful.</p>

<p>In reading or study, do not permit the light to fall on the page
from the front. It should pass over the shoulder, the left being
preferable. It is well also to wear a shade over the forehead,
especially when writing at night, and it is necessary that the
light should come from the front, on account of the shadow made
by the hands.</p>

<p>When the eyes become weary and the letters or figures begin to
dance and flicker, cease work. If a cinder lodges under the lids,
do not attempt to remove it by rubbing; that only adds to the
irritation. Close the eye and then carefully draw the upper lid
over the lower. This will cause a flow of the fluid of the eye
which will probably wash away the substance.</p>

<p>If this fails, a friend is not likely to have any trouble in
removing the object with the corner of a silk handkerchief. Should
he find it impossible to relieve you, go without delay to an oculist.</p>

<p>Sometimes the eyes of children have been weakened by sickness,
and it is necessary to use spectacles. When a boy or girl feels
any peculiar sensation about the eyes, or they seem to act wrongly,
the oculist should be appealed to at once.</p>

<p>
<em>FEET</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The feet must be kept clean and warm. Some prefer cotton and
some woolen stockings. Use whichever are the most comfortable.
Never wear shoes that are too tight. If you do you will suffer
in after years from corns and bunions. The nails of the feet as
well as of the hand should be kept pared and clean, but their
surface should never be scraped.</p>

<p>  How can the hair be made glossy? How is that superior to pomatum?  
How should the head be cleaned?</p>

<p>  Of what use is the hair? Why are so many men baldheaded? Why
is it   rare that we meet a baldheaded woman? When only should
the head be   covered?</p>

<p>  What is said of the ear? How should it be kept clean?</p>

<p>  What of the wax in the ear?</p>

and   then?</p>

<p>  What is said of straining the eyes? What of a strong glare
of light?</p>

<p>  What rule should be followed in reading or study? What of a
shade?</p>

<p>  When should you cease using the eyes? What should be done if
a   cinder gets under the lid?</p>

<p>  When must spectacles be used, or an oculist consulted?</p>

<p>  How must the feet be kept? Which are the better, cotton or
woolen   stockings? What of tight shoes? What should be done with
the nails? </p>
