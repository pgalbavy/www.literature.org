<p><em>HIS </em>humour was misplaced, and both of them would have
been nothing less than dismayed could they have foreseen in what
manner he was destined to misplace it again, and to what damage;
for not gossip, nor scandal, nor slander’s very self can leave
a trail more ruinous than may a merry bit of drollery misplaced.
The occasion of the catastrophe was not immediate, however; it
befell a month later, when the Oliphants made a celebration to
mark the arrival of the baby and the completed recovery of the
baby’s mother. Mrs. Oliphant gave a "family dinner."</p>

<p>She felt that something in the nature of a mild banquet was called
for, and her interpretation of "the family" was a liberal one.
Except those within her household, and except her mother, who
was still somehow "hanging on," she had no relatives of her own;
but the kinsfolk of her husband were numerous, and she invited
them all to meet their new little kinsman.</p>

<p>They were presented to this personage; and then the jubilant
father, carrying him high in his arms and shouting, led a lively
procession into the dining-room. The baby behaved well, in spite
of the noise his father made, and showed no alarm to be held so
far aloft in the air, even when he was lifted as high as his bearer’s
arms could reach.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," Dan shouted, thus interpreting his offspring’s
thoughts in the matter, "grandparents, great-uncles, great-aunts,
uncle Harlan, second-cousins and third-cousins, kindly sit down
and eat as much as you can. And please remember I invite you to
my christening, one week from next Sunday; and if you want to
know what’s goin’ to be my name, why, it’s Henry for my grandpa,
and Daniel for my papa, and Oliphant for all of us. Take a good
look at me, because I’m Henry Daniel Oliphant, ladies and gentlemen,
the son and heir to Ornaby Addition!"</p>

<p>There was cheering and applause; then the company sat down; the
nurse took the little lacy white bundle from the protesting father’s
arms; and Henry Daniel Oliphant was borne away amid the customary
demonstrations, and carried upstairs to his cradle.</p>

<p>Dan, at the head of the table, held forth in the immemorial manner
of young fathers: the baby had laughed his first laugh that very
morning;—Dan was sure it was neither an illusion of his own nor
a chance configuration of the baby’s features. It was absolutely
an actual human laugh, although at first the astounded parent
hadn’t been able to believe it, because he’d never heard of any
baby’s laughing when it was only a month old. But when Henry Daniel
laughed not once, but twice, and moreover went on laughing for
certainly as long as thirty-five seconds, the fact was proven
and no longer to be doubted. "No, sir, I just had to believe my
own eyes when he kept right <em>on</em> laughin’ up at me that
way, as if he thought I was a mighty funny lookin’ old thing to
be his daddy. My, but it does seem like a miracle to have your
son look up at you that way and laugh! I hope he’ll keep doin’
it his whole life long, too. I’m certainly goin’ to do all <em>I</em>
can to keep him from ever havin’ anything happen he can’t laugh
at!"</p>

<p>He continued, becoming jovially oratorical upon his theme, while
down at the other end of the long table, sitting between the baby’s
grandfather and grandmother, Lena now and then gave him a half-veiled,
quick glance that a chance observer might have defined as inscrutable.</p>

<p>Her pretty black-and-white dress of fluffy chiffon was designed
with a more revealing coquetry than the times sanctioned; so that
her amiable father-in-law, though not himself conscious of any
disapproval, withheld from expression his thought that it was
just as well that Mrs. Savage could not be of the company. The
ruthless old lady might have supplemented her "lesson" to Lena,
although it had produced somewhat pointedly the reverse of its
intended effect. The young mother was "painted" more dashingly
than the bride had been, and her lips as well as her cheeks were
made so vivid that probably her friends in New York would have
found her more than ever the French doll—a discontented French
doll, they might have said.</p>

<p>Yet, to her credit, if she was discontented, she made an effort
not to seem so; she chattered gayly to her mother-in-law and Mr.
Oliphant, laughed with them about Dan’s bragging of his offspring,
and coquetted demurely with one or two elderly cousins-in-law.
A young one, Mr. Frederic Oliphant, seemed genuinely to amuse
her, which was what led to misfortune. He found her laughter a
sweet fluting in his ears, and, wishing to hear more of it, elaborated
the solemn-mannered waggeries that produced it.</p>

<p>"It’s a great thing to be the only father in the world," he said.
"I suppose it’s even greater than being an earl."</p>

<p>"Why than an earl particularly?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Didn’t you know? At the club and downtown nowadays they speak
of your husband as the ‘Earl of Ornaby.’ You may not have noticed
it, but he sometimes mentions a place called Ornaby Addition.
Now that he’s got another subject though, I suspect his title
ought to be changed to ‘Father of the Heir to Ornaby.’ Doesn’t
that seem more intriguing, if I may employ the expression?"</p>

<p>"Most intriguing!" she agreed. "But since my husband’s the ‘Earl,’
am I called the ‘Countess of Ornaby’?"</p>

<p>"No; they leave you out of it, and I’m afraid you’ll be left
out of it again if the new title’s conferred on him. No one would
get an idea from his orations that the Heir to Ornaby has a mother.
A father would seem to be Henry Daniel’s sole and total ancestry."
Then, as she laughed again, Fred added his unfortunate afterthought.
"No; I forgot. I believe he does include a godmother as a sort
of secondary necessity."</p>

<p>"Does he? We haven’t talked about who’s to be the godmother yet.
We haven’t selected one."</p>

<p>"‘We?’" Fred repeated, affecting surprise. "You seem to think
you have something to do with it! Perhaps when the father of the
Heir to Ornaby gets around to it, he may condescend to inform
you that the godmother was selected the very night after the heir
was born."</p>

<p>"Was she?" Lena laughed. "Where? At the club?"</p>

<p>"Goodness, no! Don’t you know where Dan went that night?"</p>

<p>"Just to the club, didn’t he?" Lena said cheerfully, a little
surprised. "That’s all I heard mentioned about it afterwards,
at least."</p>

<p>"Ah, they cover up these things from you, I see. It’s time somebody
warned you of what’s going on." And Fred was inspired to add:
"Haven’t you realized yet there’s an enchantress living right
next door to you?"</p>

<p>From the young man’s own point of view, this was foolery altogether
harmless: Martha Shelby was almost "one of the family"—so near
to being one of them, in fact, that he would not have been at
all surprised to find her included in this family party—and the
episode of his call upon her, with his cousin, upon the night
after the baby’s birth, seemed to him of no other than a jocose
significance. Like Dan’s "speech" to Martha, it merely illustrated
the hare-brained condition of a new-made father, and in that light
was handy material for a family dinner-table humorist.</p>

<p>In this capacity, therefore, he blundered on. "Yes, indeed—right
next door! Old Dan may <em>look</em> like the steady, plodding
homebody sort of husband, but when that type really breaks out
it’s the wildest of all."</p>

<p>Lena gave the <em>farceur</em> a sidelong glance the sobriety
of which he failed to perceive; but at once she seemed to fall
in with the spirit of his burlesquing, and, assuming a mock solemnity
herself, "This is terrible news!" she said. "I suspected him of
being rather wild, but I didn’t suppose he’d go so far as to appoint
an enchantress to be the godmother."</p>

<p>"And not only appointed her, but called on her in the middle
of the night to notify her of the appointment," Fred added. "Not
only that, but dragged <em>me</em> along to be a chaperon!"</p>

<p>"No! Did he? How funny!"</p>

<p>"The way he behaved when we got there, I think he needed one!"
the youth continued, expanding in the warmth of her eagerly responsive
laughter. "We <em>did</em> get oratory! He explained to the enchantress
that she was the only person who could understand his son’s being
a god and the meaning of the universe; but that wasn’t all. Oh,
not by any means!"</p>

<p>"But he <em>couldn’t</em> have done worse than that!" she laughed.
"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>Fred was so overcome by mirthful recollection that he was unable
to retain his affectation of solemnity;—a sputtering chuckle escaped
him. "I wish you’d been there to hear him telling Martha he wanted
Henry Daniel to grow up to be like <em>her</em>!"</p>

<p>"No! Did he?"</p>

<p>The jovial Frederic failed to catch the overtone in her voice,
but happening to glance at Harlan, who sat opposite him, he was
surprised, too late, by a brief pantomime of warning. Harlan frowned
and pointedly shook his head; and at the same time Mrs. Oliphant,
across whom the merry colloquy had taken place, began hastily
to talk to Fred about his health. His mother had told her that
he was ruining it at the club, she said amiably, and, to his mystification,
became voluble upon the subject; but she also was too late. Lena
continued to laugh, and, turning to Mr. Oliphant, prattled cheerily
about nothing;—but Harlan saw her covert glance at the other end
of the table where her husband was still bragging of Henry Daniel;
and, although her eyelids quickly descended upon it, this glance
was an evanescent spark glowing brightly for an instant through
the fringe of blackened lashes.</p>

<p>When the party left the table to prepare for the charades—the
customary entertainment offered to one another by the Oliphants
on such occasions—Frederic sought an opportunity to speak privately
with Harlan.</p>

<p>"What on earth were you shaking your head at me like that for?
<em>I</em> wasn’t saying anything."</p>

<p>"Weren’t you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not! And your mother kept talking to me as fast as
she could all the rest of the time we were at the table. Looked
as if she was afraid for me to open my mouth again! What was it
all about?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Then what made you act as if it was something?" Fred inquired.
"You certainly don’t think your sister-in-law would ever be jealous
of dear old <em>Martha</em>, do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Harlan said. "Not jealous. They don’t get on very well,
though, I believe."</p>

<p>"What? Why, I passed by here only the other day and saw Martha
coming out of the front door. She was laughing and waving her
hand back to some one in the doorway and——"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. She still comes to see mother sometimes, as she always
did; but I believe she doesn’t ask for Lena any more when she
comes. I understand Lena has never returned her call. You may
have noticed that ladies regard those things as important?"</p>

<p>"What of it? Lena would certainly understand. I’d never have
mentioned our going in there that night, if there’d been any reason
for her to mind it," Fred protested. "What’s more, she <em>doesn’t</em>
mind it. Look at her now."</p>

<p>He nodded toward where, across the broad drawing-room, Lena was
helping to set the stage for the first of the charades. She moved
with a dancing step, laughing and chattering to the group about
her; and as she dropped a green velvet table cover over the back
of an armchair, announcing that this drapery made the chair into
a throne, she flung out her graceful little arms and whirled herself
round and round in an airy pirouette. Fred laughed aloud, finding
himself well-warranted in thinking his cousin’s uneasiness superfluous;
for Lena seemed to be, indeed, the life of the party. Moreover,
she remained in these high spirits all evening; and Harlan began
to feel reassured, for this was what he and his mother and father
had learned to think of as "Lena’s other mood"; and sometimes
it lasted for several days.</p>

<p>The present example of it was not to cover so extensive a period,
however; although when the guests had gone she kissed her mother-in-law
good-night affectionately, patted Mr. Oliphant’s shoulder, and
then waved a sparkling little hand over the banisters to Harlan
as she skipped upstairs and he stood below, locking the front
doors. Humming "Tell me, pretty maiden," from "Floradora," she
disappeared from his sight in the direction of her own room, but
it was not there she went.</p>

<p>Instead, she opened the door beyond hers, stepped within and
closed it;—and during this slight and simple series of commonplace
movements she underwent a sharp alteration. She had carried her
liveliness all the way to the very doorknob, and, until she touched
it, was still the pirouetting Lena who had been the life of the
party; then suddenly she stood in the room, haggard; so that what
happened to her was like the necromantic withering of a bright
flower during the mere opening and closing of a door.</p>

<p>It was Dan’s room, and he had just taken off his coat, preparing
for bed. "Got to be out at Ornaby by six to-morrow morning," he
explained. "A contractor’s goin’ to meet me there to pick out
a site for our automobile works. I won’t get much sleep, I guess—up
at five this morning, too." He yawned, and then, laughing, apologized.
"I beg your pardon, Lena; I don’t mean I’m sleepy, if you want
to talk the party over. You were just lovely this evening, and
the whole family thought so, too. You made it a great success,
and you can be certain we all appreciate it. <em>I</em> certainly
do."</p>

<p>Facing him blankly, leaning back against the door with her hands
behind her, she said nothing; and he stepped toward her solicitously.
"I’m afraid you tired yourself out at it—only a week out of bed,
poor child! You look——"</p>

<p>"Never mind how I look," she said in a low voice, and as his
hand was extended placatively, to pet her, she struck at it. "Just
you keep away from me!"</p>

<p>"Why, Lena!" he cried. "What in the world’s the matter?"</p>

<p>She continued to stare at him, not replying, and he saw that
she was trembling slightly from head to foot. "Lena! You’re lettin’
yourself get all upset over something or other again. You’ve gone
ever since Henry was born without gettin’ this way. I was almost
in hopes—in hopes——"</p>

<p>"Yes?" she said, as he faltered. "What were your hopes?"</p>

<p>"Why, I was almost in hopes it—it wouldn’ happen again."</p>

<p>"What wouldn’t happen again?"</p>

<p>"Your gettin’ upset like this," he answered apologetically. "I
honestly did pretty near hope it, Lena. It seemed to me we’d maybe
kind of reached a turning point and could get along all right
together, now Henry’s come to us."</p>

<p>"Maybe we <em>have</em> reached a turning point," she said. "I
suppose it’s generally considered <em>quite</em> a turning point
when a wife leaves her husband for just cause, isn’t it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" Dan sighed, and sat down heavily on the side of
his bed, taking his head between his hands. "I guess we’ve got
to go through another of ’em."</p>

<p>"Another of what?"</p>

<p>"Another of these troubles," he sighed. "Well, what’s this one
all about, Lena?"</p>

<p>She came toward him angrily. "I’d like to know what you’d think
of any other man that treated his wife as you do me! What would
you say of any other man who went out the very night his child
was born and did what you did?"</p>

<p>"Why, I didn’t do anything," he said, and looked up at her, surprised.</p>

<p>"You didn’t? Don’t you call it anything to go to see that woman
at midnight?"</p>

<p>"You mean our goin’ in to Martha’s?" Dan asked, his surprise
increasing. "It wasn’t midnight; it was about ten o’clock, and
we only stayed a few minutes—half an hour maybe. I just wanted
to tell her about the baby."</p>

<p>"Yes, so I hear," Lena returned bitterly. "You took particularly
good care not to mention that little call to me afterwards!"</p>

<p>"No; I didn’t," he protested. "I never thought of it; I’ve been
too busy thinkin’ about the baby and Ornaby. I don’t say though"—he
paused, and then went on with painful honesty: "I don’t say I
<em>would</em> have mentioned it to you, if I <em>had</em> thought
of it. I know you’ve never liked Martha. We could all see that,
and it’s been sort of a trouble to us——"</p>

<p>"To ‘us’?" she interrupted sharply. "To whom?"</p>

<p>"Well, to me, of course; but I mean mother, too, though she’s
never said anything about it. We’ve all been as fond of Martha
all her life as if she was one of our own family, and, for instance,
I think mother was probably a little worried because she thought
she’d better not invite her to-night, on your account. What I
mean, though, is that I probably mightn’t have told you about
our goin’ in to see her that night, even if I had thought of it
afterwards, because as I knew how you felt about her I’d have
been afraid of it’s gettin’ you into one of these upsetnesses.
I guess I’d have been right, too," he added, with a rueful laugh.
"Somebody’s told you about it, and you <em>have</em> got into
one."</p>

<p>"How kind of you! So you admit you went running to her the minute
the baby was born, and yet you knew perfectly well how I felt
about her."</p>

<p>"Well—I knew how unreasonably you felt about her."</p>

<p>"‘Unreasonably?’" Lena cried shrilly. "What a wise little word!
When you told her she was the only woman in the world who understands
you!"</p>

<p>"No, no! <em>I</em> don’t care who understands me," Dan protested
unhappily. "I meant she was the only one that would understand
what I was sayin’ about the baby. I just <em>had</em> to talk
about him, and she always understands anything at a time like
that—or any time, for that matter. She——"</p>

<p>"Go on!" Lena said. "Go on making it worse!"</p>

<p>"But I’m only tryin’ to explain how——"</p>

<p>"Explain <em>this</em>, then! You told her you wanted my child
to grow up to be like <em>her</em>."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," Dan said reasonably. "I didn’t mean to <em>look</em>
like her; I only meant I hoped he’d have her qualities. Anybody
that knows Martha would feel that way, Lena. Why, except my own
father and mother, she’s the most even-tempered, understanding,
helpful kind of person I ever knew in my life. Why, everybody
in town looks up to her just the same as I do, and <em>any_body’d
have said _that</em> to her, Lena. You would yourself, if you
had only not let yourself get prejudiced against her about nothin’
at all and just been sensible enough to really get acquainted
with her."</p>

<p>Lena stood before him rigidly, except for the trembling, which
had increased a little. "Tell me another thing," she said. "When
a young wife becomes a mother, does her husband ever consult her
before inviting a woman she doesn’t like to act as godmother for
the child?"</p>

<p>Dan got up and began to pace the room, his face reddening with
a prophetic distress. "Oh, golly!" he groaned. "You’re goin’ to
object to it. I see that now!"</p>

<p>"You do see it, do you? How remarkable!"</p>

<p>He turned to her appealingly. "Look here, Lena; I <em>did</em>
speak about it to her too soon. Of course I ought to’ve consulted
you first;—I was just so enthusiastic about bein’ the boy’s father,
and she’s such a dear, good, old friend—well, I guess I was excited.
I know I ought to’ve waited and asked you who you wanted—but I
didn’t. I <em>did</em> just blurt out and ask her, so it’s done
and can’t be helped. Well, I can’t go back on it; I <em>can’t</em>
go over there and just plain tell her you don’t want her!"</p>

<p>"Can’t you?" Lena said. "It doesn’t matter to me what you tell
her."</p>

<p>"You’re not goin’ to make me, are you?" he asked piteously.</p>

<p>"No. Tell her anything you like."</p>

<p>Mistaking this icy permission, he uttered an almost vociferous
sigh of relief. "Well, I do truly thank you, Lena. If you’re noble
enough to overlook my selfishness in not thinkin’ about who you’d
want to have for Henry’s godmother—well, my goodness, I <em>am</em>
grateful to you, and I know it’s more’n I deserve. It’s a noble
action on your part, and I’m sure it’s goin’ to lead to splendid
results, because now you can’t help but get better acquainted
with Martha, and you’ll do what I’ve hoped for so long: you’ll
get to likin’ her and thinkin’ as much of her as everybody else
does. With her in that relation——"</p>

<p>"In what relation?"</p>

<p>"In the relation of the baby’s godmother. From the very day of
the christening you’ll——"</p>

<p>"There may not be any such day," Lena interrupted. "You seem
to have mistaken me. There may not be any christening—at least
not here. If she’s to be the godmother, the baby and I will be
with my own family in New York."</p>

<p>"Oh, golly!" Dan said, and sank down on the side of the bed again.
"Oh, golly!"</p>

<p>Lena became vehement. "I should think you <em>would</em> say
‘golly’! If you had a spark of remorse in you, I think you’d say
more than that!"</p>

<p>"Remorse? I don’t see——"</p>

<p>"You don’t?" she cried. "You don’t see what you have to be remorseful
for? You bring me out here to the life you’ve given me, and you
see nothing to regret? You bring me to this flat town and its
flat people, where not once in months can I hear a note of real
music and where there’s no art and no beauty and no <em>life</em>—after
you’d given me your word I should have a full year in Europe!—and
you watch me struggling to bear it, to bear it with the best bravery
I have in me, and the most kindness to you—and to be cheerful—and
I <em>dare</em> you to say I haven’t made the best of it! I <em>have</em>—and
how <em>hard</em> I’ve had to try most of the time to accomplish
it! And what have you been? Who was the man I found I’d married?
Even in this hole of a town he’s called a failure—the town failure!
That’s who you got me to marry! Even these people out here—your
own people—even they take you as a joke—the town joke! And when
I make the best of it I can and bear it the best I can, and go
on, month after month, not complaining, and suffer what I suffered
when the baby came, you go gayly over to the woman whose hand
you held the very first day I came here—yes, you did!—and the
woman you’ve compared me to unfavourably every time you’ve ever
dared to speak of me to her—yes, you have; every single <em>time</em>!—and
you ask her to come and be the godmother to my child! You can
go over there and tell her anything you like—tell her again you
want my baby to be like her—but there’s one thing you’d better
tell her besides, and that is, there won’t <em>be</em> any christening
if she comes to it!"</p>

<p>She ran out, the closing of the door reverberating eloquently
through the house; and Dan remained seated upon the side of the
bed, his head between his hands. It was by no means the first
time he had remained in that position when Lena slammed the door. </p>
