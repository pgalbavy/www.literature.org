<P>

LONG before having
arrived at this part of my work, a crowd of difficulties will have
occurred to the reader. Some of them are so grave that to this day I
can never reflect on them without being staggered; but, to the best of
my judgment, the greater number are only apparent, and those that are
real are not, I think, fatal to my theory.

<P>
These difficulties and objections may be classed under the
following heads:-Firstly, why, if species have descended from other
species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see
innumerable transitional forms? Why is not all nature in confusion
instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?

<P>
Secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the
structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the
modification of some animal with wholly different habits? Can we
believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs
of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as
a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of 
such wonderful
structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet fully understand the
inimitable perfection?

<P>
Thirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural
selection? What shall we say to so marvellous an instinct 
as that which leads the bee to make cells, which have practically
anticipated the discoveries of profound mathematicians?

<P>
Fourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being
sterile and producing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties are
crossed, their fertility is unimpaired?

<P>
The two first heads shall be here discussed   Instinct and
Hybridism in separate chapters.
<P>
<I>On the absence or rarity of transitional varieties.</I> 
As natural selection acts solely by the preservation
of profitable modifications, each new form will tend in a
fully-stocked country to take the place of, and finally to
exterminate, its own less improved parent or other less-favoured forms
with which it comes into competition. Thus extinction and natural
selection will, as we have seen, go hand in hand. Hence, if we look at
each species as descended from some other unknown form, both the
parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been
exterminated by the very process of formation and perfection of the
new form.

<P>
But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have
existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the
crust of the earth? It will be much more convenient to discuss this
question in the chapter on the Imperfection of the geological record;
and I will here only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in
the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed;
the imperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic beings not
inhabiting 
profound depths of the sea, and to their remains being
embedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sediment
sufficiently thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount of
future degradation; and such fossiliferous masses can be accumulated
only where much sediment is deposited on the shallow bed of the sea,
whilst it slowly subsides. These contingencies will concur only
rarely, and after enormously long intervals. Whilst the bed of the sea
is stationary or is rising, or when very little sediment is being
deposited, there will be blanks in our geological history. The crust
of the earth is a vast museum;  but the natural
collections have been made only at intervals of time immensely remote.

<P>
But it may be urged that when several closely-allied species
inhabit the same territory we surely ought to find at the present time
many transitional forms. Let us take a simple case: in travelling from
north to south over a continent, we generally meet at successive
intervals with closely allied or representative species, evidently
filling nearly the same place in the natural economy of the land.
These representative species often meet and interlock; and as the one
becomes rarer and rarer, the other becomes more and more frequent,
till the one replaces the other. But if we compare these species where
they intermingle, they are generally as absolutely distinct from each
other in every detail of structure as are specimens taken from the
metropolis inhabited by each. By my theory these allied species have
descended from a common parent; and during the process of
modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life of its
own region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent
and all the transitional varieties between its past and present
states. Hence we ought not to expect at the 
present time to meet with
numerous transitional varieties in each region, though they must have
existed there, and may be embedded there in a fossil condition. But in
the intermediate region, having intermediate conditions of life, why
do we not now find closely-linking intermediate varieties? This
difficulty for a long time quite confounded me. But I think it can be
in large part explained.

<P>
In the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring,
because an area is now continuous, that it has been continuous during
a long period.  Geology would lead us to believe that almost every
continent has been broken up into islands even during the later
tertiary periods; and in such islands distinct species might have been
separately formed without the possibility of intermediate varieties
existing in the intermediate zones. By changes in the form of the land
and of climate, marine areas now continuous must often have existed
within recent times in a far less continuous and uniform condition
than at present. But I will pass over this way of escaping from the
difficulty;  for I believe that many perfectly defined
species have been formed on strictly continuous areas; though I do not
doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous has
played an important part in the formation of new species, more
especially with freely-crossing and wandering animals.

<P>
In looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area,
we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then
becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and
finally disappearing. Hence the neutral territory between two
representative species is generally narrow in comparison with the
territory proper to each. We see the same fact in ascending mountains,
and sometimes 
it is quite remarkable how abruptly, as Alph. De
Candolle has observed, a common alpine species disappears.  The same
fact has been noticed by Forbes in sounding the depths of the sea with
the dredge. To those who look at climate and the physical conditions
of life as the all-important elements of distribution, these facts
ought to cause surprise, as climate and height or depth graduate away
insensibly. But when we bear in mind that almost every species, even
in its metropolis, would increase immensely in numbers, were it not
for other competing species; that nearly all either prey on or serve
as prey for others; in short, that each organic being is either
directly or indirectly related in the most important manner to other
organic beings, we must see that the range of the inhabitants of any
country by no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing
physical conditions, but in large part on the presence of other
species, on which it depends, or by which it is destroyed, or with
which it comes into competition; and as these species are already
defined objects (however they may have become so), not blending one
into another by insensible gradations, the range of any one species,
depending as it does on the range of others, will tend to be sharply
defined. Moreover, each species on the confines of its range, where it
exists in lessened numbers, will, during fluctuations in the number of
its enemies or of its prey, or in the seasons, be extremely liable to
utter extermination; and thus its geographical range will come to be
still more sharply defined.

<P>
If I am right in believing that allied or representative species,
 when inhabiting a continuous area, are generally so
distributed that each has a wide range, with a comparatively narrow
neutral territory between them, in which they become rather suddenly
rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do not essentially differ from
species, 
the same rule will probably apply to both; and if we in
imagination adapt a varying species to a very large area, we shall
have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a third variety to
a narrow intermediate zone. The intermediate variety, consequently,
will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and lesser area;
and practically, as far as I can make out, this rule holds good with
varieties in a state of nature. I have met with striking instances of
the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between well-marked
varieties in the genus Balanus. And it would appear from information
given me by Mr Watson, Dr Asa Gray, and Mr Wollaston, that generally
when varieties intermediate between two other forms occur, they are
much rarer numerically than the forms which they connect. Now, if we
may trust these facts and inferences, and therefore conclude that
varieties linking two other varieties together have generally existed
in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, then, I think, we
can understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very
long periods;   why as a general rule they should be
exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they
originally linked together.

<P>
For any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked,
run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large
numbers; and in this particular case the intermediate form would be
eminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on
both sides of it. But a far more important consideration, as I
believe, is that, during the process of further modification, by which
two varieties are supposed on my theory to be converted and perfected
into two distinct species, the two which exist in larger numbers from
inhabiting larger areas, will have a great advantage over the
intermediate variety, which exists 
in smaller numbers in a narrow and
intermediate zone. For forms existing in larger numbers will always
have a better chance, within any given period, of presenting further
favourable variations for natural selection to seize on, than will the
 rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers. Hence, the
more common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and
supplant the less common forms, for these will be more slowly modified
and improved. It is the same principle which, as I believe, accounts
for the common species in each country, as shown in the second
chapter, presenting on an average a greater number of well-marked
varieties than do the rarer species. I may illustrate what I mean by
supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept, one adapted to an
extensive mountainous region; a second to a comparatively narrow,
hilly tract; and a third to wide plains at the base; and that the
inhabitants are all trying with equal
steadiness and skill to improve their stocks by selection; the chances
in this case will be strongly in favour of the great holders on the
mountains or on the plains improving their breeds more quickly than
the small holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly tract; and
consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take the
place of the less improved hill breed; and thus the two breeds, which
originally existed in greater numbers, will come into close contact
with each other, without the interposition of the supplanted,
intermediate hill-variety.

<P>
To sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined
objects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos
of varying and intermediate links: firstly, because new varieties are
very slowly formed, for variation is a very slow process, and natural
selection can do nothing until favourable variations chance to occur,
and until a place in the natural 
polity of the country can be better
filled by some modification of some one or more of its inhabitants. And
such new places will depend on slow changes of climate, or on the
occasional immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in a still
more important degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly
modified, with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting and
reacting on each other. So that, in any one region and at any one
time, we ought only to see a few species presenting slight
modifications of structure in some degree permanent; and this
assuredly we do see.

<P>
 Secondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the
recent period in isolated portions, in which many forms, 
more especially amongst the classes which unite for each birth and
wander much, may have separately been rendered sufficiently distinct
to rank as representative species. In this case, intermediate
varieties between the several representative species and their common
parent, must formerly have existed in each broken portion of the land,
but these links will have been supplanted and exterminated during the
process of natural selection, so that they will no longer exist in a
living state.

<P>
Thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different
portions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will,
it is probable, at first have been formed in the intermediate zones,
but they will generally have had a short duration. For these
intermediate varieties will, from reasons already assigned (namely
from what we know of the actual distribution of closely allied or
representative species, and likewise of acknowledged varieties), exist
in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers than the varieties which
they tend to connect. From this cause alone the intermediate 
varieties
will be liable to accidental extermination; and during the process of
further modification through natural selection, they will almost
certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect;
for these from existing in greater numbers will, in the aggregate,
present more variation, and thus be further improved through natural
selection and gain further advantages.

<P>
Lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory
be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all
the species of the same group together, must assuredly have existed;
but the very process of natural selection constantly tends, as has
been so often remarked, to exterminate the parent forms and the
intermediate links. Consequently evidence of their former existence
could be found only amongst fossil remains, which are preserved, as we
shall in a future chapter attempt to show, in an extremely imperfect
and intermittent record.
<P>
<I>On the origin and transitions of organic beings
with peculiar habits and structure.</I> 
It has been asked by the
opponents of such views as I hold, how, for instance, a land
carnivorous animal could have been converted into one with aquatic
habits;  for how could the animal in its transitional
state have subsisted?  It would be easy to show that within the same
group carnivorous animals exist having every intermediate grade
between truly aquatic and strictly terrestrial habits; and as each
exists by a struggle for life, it is clear that each is well adapted
in its habits to its place in nature. Look at the Mustela vison of
North America, which has webbed feet and which resembles an otter in
its fur, short legs, and form of tail; during summer this animal dives
for and preys on fish, but during the long winter 
it leaves the frozen
waters, and preys like other polecats on mice and land animals. If a
different case had been taken, and it had been asked how an
insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted into a
flying bat, the question would have been far more difficult, and I
could have given no answer.  Yet I think such difficulties have very
little weight.

<P>
Here, as on other occasions, I lie under a heavy disadvantage, for
out of the many striking cases which I have collected, I can give only
one or two instances of transitional habits and structures in closely
allied species of the same genus; and of diversified habits, either
constant or occasional, in the same species. And it seems to me that
nothing less than a long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen
the difficulty in any particular case like that of the bat.

<P>
Look at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest gradation
from animals with their tails only slightly flattened, and from
others, as Sir J. Richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of
their bodies rather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather
full, to the so-called flying squirrels; and flying squirrels have
their limbs and even the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of
skin, which serves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the
air to an astonishing distance from tree to tree. We cannot doubt that
each structure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country,
by enabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey, or to collect food
more quickly, or, as there is reason to believe, by lessening the
danger from occasional falls. But it does not follow from this fact
that the structure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to
conceive under all natural conditions. Let the climate and vegetation
change, let other  competing rodents or new beasts of prey
immigrate, or old ones 
become modified, and all analogy would lead us
to believe that some at least of the squirrels would decrease in
numbers or become exterminated, unless they also became modified and
improved in structure in a corresponding manner. Therefore, I can see
no difficulty, more especially under changing conditions of life, in
the continued preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller
flank-membranes, each modification being useful, each being
propagated, until by the accumulated effects of this process of
natural selection, a perfect so-called flying squirrel was produced.

<P>
Now look at the Galeopithecus or flying lemur, which formerly was
falsely ranked amongst bats. It has an extremely wide flank-membrane,
stretching from the corners of the jaw to the tail, and including the
limbs and the elongated fingers: the flank membrane is, also,
furnished with an extensor muscle. Although no graduated links of
structure, fitted for gliding through the air, now connect the
Galeopithecus with the other Lemuridae, yet I can see no difficulty in
supposing that such links formerly existed, and that each had been
formed by the same steps as in the case of the less perfectly gliding
squirrels; and that each grade of structure had been useful to its
possessor. Nor can I see any insuperable difficulty in further
believing it possible that the membrane-connected fingers and fore-arm
of the Galeopithecus might be greatly lengthened by natural selection;
and this, as far as the organs of flight are concerned, would convert
it into a bat. In bats which have the wing-membrane extended from the
top of the shoulder to the tail, including the hind-legs, we perhaps
see traces of an apparatus originally constructed for gliding through
the air rather than for flight.

<P>
If about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were
unknown, who would have ventured to have 
surmised that birds might
have existed which used their wings solely as flappers, like the
logger-headed duck (Micropterus of Eyton); as fins in the water and
front legs on the land, like the penguin; as sails, like the ostrich;
and functionally for no purpose, like the Apteryx. Yet the structure
of each of these birds is good for it, under the conditions of life to
which it is exposed, for each has  to live by a struggle;
but it is not necessarily the best possible under all possible
conditions. It must not be inferred from these remarks that any of the
grades of wing-structure here alluded to, which perhaps may all have
resulted from disuse, indicate the natural steps by which birds have
acquired their perfect power of flight; but they serve, at least, to
show what diversified means of transition are possible.

<P>
Seeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the
Crustacea and Mollusca are adapted to live on the land, and seeing
that we have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most
diversified types, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable
that flying-fish, which now glide far through the air, slightly rising
and turning by the aid of their fluttering fins, might have been
modified into perfectly winged animals. If early transitional state
they had been inhabitants of the open ocean, and had used their
incipient organs of flight exclusively, as far as we know, to escape
being devoured by other fish?

<P>
When we see any structure highly perfected for any particular
habit, as the wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that
animals displaying early transitional grades of the structure will
seldom continue to exist to the present day, for they will have been
supplanted by the very process of perfection through natural
selection.  Furthermore, we may conclude that transitional 
grades
between structures fitted for very different habits of life will
rarely have been developed at an early period in great numbers and
under many subordinate forms. Thus, to return to our imaginary
illustration of the flying-fish, it does not seem probable that fishes
capable of true flight would have been developed under many
subordinate forms, for taking prey of many kinds in many ways, on the
land and in the water, until their organs of flight had come to a high
stage of perfection, so as to have given them a decided advantage over
other animals in the battle for life. Hence the chance of discovering
species with transitional grades of structure in a fossil condition
will always be less, from their having existed in lesser numbers, than
in the case of species with fully developed structures.

<P>
I will now give two or three instances of diversified and of
changed habits in the individuals of the same species. When
either case occurs, it would be easy for natural selection to fit the
animal, by some modification of its structure, for its changed habits,
or exclusively for one of its several different habits. But it is
difficult to tell, and immaterial for us, whether habits generally
change first and structure afterwards; or whether slight modifications
of structure lead to changed habits; both probably often change almost
simultaneously. Of cases of changed habits it will suffice merely to
allude to that of the many British insects which now feed on exotic
plants, or exclusively on artificial substances. Of diversified habits
innumerable instances could be given: I have often watched a tyrant
flycatcher (Saurophagus sulphuratus) in South America, hovering over
one spot and then proceeding to another, like a kestrel, and at other
times standing stationary on the margin of water, and then dashing
like a kingfisher at a fish. In our own country the larger titmouse
(Parus major) may be 
seen climbing branches, almost like a creeper; it
often, like a shrike, kills small birds by blows on the head; and I
have many times seen and heard it hammering the seeds of the yew on a
branch, and thus breaking them like a nuthatch. In North America the
black bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with widely open
mouth, thus catching, like a whale, insects in the water. Even in so
extreme a case as this, if the supply of insects were constant, and if
better adapted competitors did not already exist in the country, I can
see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered, by natural
selection, more and more aquatic in their structure and habits, with
larger and larger mouths, till a creature was produced as monstrous as
a whale.

<P>
As we sometimes see individuals of a species following habits
widely different from those both of their own species and of the other
species of the same genus, we might expect, on my theory, that such
individuals would occasionally have given rise to new species, having
anomalous habits, and with their structure either slightly or
considerably modified from that of their proper type. And such
instances do occur in nature. Can a more striking instance of
adaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and
for seizing insects in the chinks of the bark?   Yet in
North America there are woodpeckers which feed largely on fruit, and
others with elongated wings which chase insects on the wing; and on
the plains of La Plata, where not a tree grows, there is a woodpecker,
which in every essential part of its organisation, even in its
colouring, in the harsh tone of its voice, and undulatory flight, told
me plainly of its close blood-relationship
to our common species; yet it is a woodpecker which never climbs a
tree!

<P>
Petrels are the most a&euml;rial and oceanic of birds, yet in the quiet
Sounds of Tierra del Fuego, the Puffinuria 
berardi, in its general
habits, in its astonishing power of diving, its manner of swimming,
and of flying when unwillingly it takes flight, would be mistaken by
any one for an auk or grebe; nevertheless, it is essentially a petrel,
but with many parts of its organisation profoundly modified. On the
other hand, the acutest observer by examining the dead body of the
water-ouzel would never have suspected its sub-aquatic habits; yet
this anomalous member of the strictly terrestrial thrush family wholly
subsists by diving,   grasping the stones with its feet and
using its wings under water.

<P>
He who believes that each being has been created as we now see it,
must occasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal
having habits and structure not at all in agreement. What can be
plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for
swimming; yet there are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely or
never go near the water; and no one except Audubon has seen the
frigate-bird, which has all its four toes webbed, alight on the
surface of the sea. On the other hand, grebes and coots are eminently
aquatic, although their toes are only bordered by membrane. What seems
plainer than that the long toes of grallatores are formed for walking
over swamps and floating plants, yet the water-hen is nearly as
aquatic as the coot; and the landrail nearly as terrestrial as the
quail or partridge. In such cases, and many others could be given,
habits have changed without a corresponding change of structure. The
webbed feet of the upland goose may be said to have become rudimentary
in function, though not in structure. In the frigate-bird, the
deeply-scooped membrane between the toes shows that structure has
begun to change.  

<P>
He who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation will
say, that in these cases it has pleased the 
Creator to cause a being
of one type to take the place of one of another type; but this seems
to me only restating the fact in dignified language. He who believes
in the struggle for existence and in the principle of natural
selection, will acknowledge that every organic being is constantly
endeavouring to increase in numbers; and that if any one being vary
ever so little, either in habits or structure, and thus gain an
advantage over some other inhabitant of the country, it will seize on
the place of that inhabitant, however different it may be from its own
place. Hence it will cause him no surprise that there should be geese
and frigate-birds with webbed feet, either living on the dry land or
most rarely alighting on the water; that there should be long-toed
corncrakes living in meadows instead of in swamps; that there should
be woodpeckers where not a tree grows; that there should be diving
thrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks.
<P>
<I>Organs of extreme perfection and complication.</I> 
To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable
contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for
admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of
spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural
selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd 
in the highest possible degree. Yet reason tells
me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one
very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor,
can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly,
and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if
any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal
under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing
that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural 
selection,
though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.
How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more
than how life itself first originated; but I may remark that several
facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered
sensitive to light, and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the
air which produce sound.  

<P>
In looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has
been perfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors;
but this is scarcely ever possible, and we are forced in each case to
look to species of the same group, that is to the collateral
descendants from the same original parent-form, in order to see what
gradations are possible, and for the chance of some gradations having
been transmitted from the earlier stages of descent, in an unaltered
or little altered condition. Amongst existing Vertebrata, we find but
a small amount of gradation in the structure of the eye, and from
fossil species we can learn nothing on this head. In this great class
we should probably have to descend far beneath the lowest known
fossiliferous stratum to discover the earlier stages, by which the eye
has been perfected.

<P>
In the Articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve
merely coated with pigment, and without any other mechanism; and from
this low stage, numerous gradations of structure, branching off in two
fundamentally different lines, can be shown to exist, until we reach a
moderately high stage of perfection. In certain crustaceans, for
instance, there is a double cornea, the inner one divided into facets,
within each of which there is a lens shaped swelling. In other
crustaceans the transparent cones which are coated by pigment, and
which properly act only by excluding lateral pencils of light, are
convex at their upper ends 
and must act by convergence; and at their
lower ends there seems to be an imperfect vitreous substance. With
these facts, here far too briefly and
imperfectly given, which show that there is much graduated diversity
in the eyes of living crustaceans, and bearing in mind how small the
number of living animals is in proportion to those which have become
extinct, I can see no very great difficulty (not more than in the case
of many other structures) in believing that natural selection has
converted the simple apparatus of an optic nerve merely coated with
pigment and invested by transparent membrane, into an optical
instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of the great
Articulate class.

<P>
He who will go thus far, if he find on
finishing this treatise that large bodies of facts, otherwise
inexplicable, can be explained by the theory of descent, ought not to
hesitate to go further,  and to admit that a structure
even as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed by natural
selection, although in this case he does not know any of the
transitional grades. His reason ought to conquer his imagination;
though I have felt the difficulty far too
keenly to be surprised at any degree of hesitation in extending the
principle of natural selection to such startling lengths.

<P>
It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope.
We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued
efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that
the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not
this inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the
Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man?  If we must
compare the eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to
take a thick layer of transparent tissue, with a nerve sensitive to
light beneath, and then suppose every 
part of this layer to be
continually changing slowly in density, so as to separate into layers
of different densities and thicknesses, placed at different distances
from each other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing
in form. Further we must suppose that there is a power always intently
watching each slight accidental alteration in the transparent layers;
and carefully selecting each alteration which, under varied
circumstances, may in any way, or in any degree, tend to produce a
distincter image. We must suppose each new state of the instrument to
be multiplied by the million; and each to be preserved till a better
be produced, and then the old ones to be destroyed. In living bodies,
variation will cause the slight alterations, generation will multiply
them almost infinitely, and natural selection will pick out with
unerring skill each improvement. Let this process go on for millions
on millions of years; and during each year on millions of individuals
of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical instrument
might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the
Creator are to those of man?

<P>
If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which
could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight
modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find
out no such case. No doubt many organs  exist of which we
do not know the transitional grades, more especially if we look to
much-isolated species, round which, according to my theory, there has
been much extinction. Or again, if we look to an organ common to all
the members of a large class, for in this latter case the organ must
have been first formed at an extremely remote period, since which all
the many members of the class have been developed; and in order to
discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has
passed, we should have to look to very ancient ancestral forms, long
since become extinct.

<P>
We should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could
not have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind. Numerous
cases could be given amongst the lower animals of the same organ
performing at the same time wholly distinct functions; thus the
alimentary canal respires, digests, and excretes in the larva of the
dragon-fly and in the fish Cobites. In the Hydra, the animal may be
turned inside out, and the exterior surface will then digest and the
stomach respire. In such cases natural selection might easily
specialise, if any advantage were thus gained, a part or organ, which
had performed two functions, for one function alone, and thus wholly
change its nature by insensible steps. Two
distinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same function in
the same individual; to give one instance, there are fish with gills
or branchiae that breathe the air dissolved in the water, at the same
time that they breathe free air in their swimbladders, this latter
organ having a ductus pneumaticus for its supply, and being divided by
highly vascular partitions. In these cases, one of the two organs
might with ease be modified and perfected so as to perform all the
work by itself, being aided during the process of modification by the
other organ; and then this other organ might be modified for some
other and quite distinct purpose, or be quite obliterated.

<P>
The illustration of the swimbladder in
fishes is a good one, because it shows us clearly the highly important
fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose, namely
flotation, may be converted into one for a wholly different purpose,
namely respiration. The swimbladder has, also, been worked in as an
accessory to the auditory organs of certain fish, or, for I do not
know which 
view is now generally held, a part of the auditory
apparatus has been worked in as a complement to the swimbladder. All
physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous, or 'ideally
similar,' in position and structure with the lungs of the higher
vertebrate animals: hence there seems to me to be no great difficulty
in believing that natural selection has actually converted a
swimbladder into a lung, or organ used exclusively for respiration.

<P>
I can, indeed, hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having true
lungs have descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype,
of which we know nothing, furnished with a floating apparatus or
swimbladder. We can thus, as I infer from Professor Owen's interesting
description of these parts, understand the strange fact that every
particle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the
orifice of the trachea, with some risk of falling into the lungs,
notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis is
closed. In the higher Vertebrata the branchiae have wholly disappeared
  the slits on the sides of the neck and the loop-like course of
the arteries still marking in the embryo their former position. But it
is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiae might have been
gradually worked in by natural selection for some quite distinct
purpose: in the same manner as, on the view entertained by some
naturalists that the branchiae and dorsal scales of Annelids are
homologous with the wings and wing-covers of insects, it is probable
that organs which at a very ancient period served for respiration have
been actually converted into organs of flight.

<P>
In considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in
mind the probability of conversion from one function to another, that
I will give one more instance.  Pedunculated cirripedes have two
minute folds of skin, 
called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve,
through the means of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they
are hatched within the sack. These cirripedes have no branchiae, the
whole surface of the body and sack, including the small frena, serving
for respiration. The Balanidae or sessile cirripedes, on the other
hand, have no ovigerous frena, the eggs lying loose at the bottom of
the sack, in the well-enclosed shell; but they have large folded
branchiae.   Now I think no one will dispute that the
ovigerous frena in the one family are strictly homologous with the
branchiae of the other family; indeed, they graduate into each other.
Therefore I do not doubt that little folds of skin, which originally
served as ovigerous frena, but which, likewise, very slightly aided
the act of respiration, have been gradually converted by natural
selection into branchiae, simply through an increase in their size and
the obliteration of their adhesive glands.  If all pedunculated
cirripedes had become extinct, and they have already suffered far more
extinction than have sessile cirripedes, who would ever have imagined
that the branchiae in this latter family had originally existed as
organs for preventing the ova from being washed out of the sack?

<P>
Although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ
could not possibly have been produced by successive transitional
gradations, yet, undoubtedly, grave cases of difficulty occur, some of
which will be discussed in my future work.

<P>
One of the gravest is that of neuter insects, which are often very
differently constructed from either the males or fertile females; but
this case will be treated of in the next chapter. The electric organs
of fishes offer another case of special difficulty; it is impossible
to conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced;
but, as Owen and others have remarked, 
their intimate structure
closely resembles that of common muscle; and as it has lately been
shown that Rays have an organ closely analogous to the electric
apparatus, and yet do not, as Matteuchi asserts, discharge any
electricity, we must own that we are far 
too ignorant to argue that no transition of any
kind is possible.

<P>
The electric organs offer another and even more serious difficulty;
for they occur in only about a dozen fishes, of which several are
widely remote in their affinities.  Generally when the same organ
appears in several members of the same class, especially if in members
having very different habits of life, we may attribute its presence to
inheritance from a common ancestor; and its absence in some of the
members to its loss through disuse or natural selection. But if the
electric organs had been inherited from one ancient progenitor thus
provided, we might have  expected that all electric fishes
would have been specially related to each other. Nor does geology at
all lead to the belief that formerly most fishes had electric organs,
which most of their modified descendants have lost. The presence of
luminous organs in a few insects, belonging to different families and
orders, offers a parallel case of difficulty.  Other cases could be
given; for instance in plants, the very curious contrivance of a mass
of pollen-grains, borne on a foot-stalk with a sticky gland at the
end, is the same in Orchis and Asclepias,   genera almost as
remote as possible amongst flowering plants. In all these cases of two
very distinct species furnished with apparently the same anomalous
organ, it should be observed that, although the general appearance and
function of the organ may be the same, yet some fundamental difference
can generally be detected. I am inclined to believe that in nearly the
same way as two men have sometimes independently hit on 
the very same
invention, so natural selection, working for the good of each being
and taking advantage of analogous variations, has sometimes modified
in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic beings, which
owe but little of their structure in common to inheritance from the
same ancestor.

<P>
Although in many cases it is most difficult to conjecture by what
transitions an organ could have arrived at its present state; yet,
considering that the proportion of living and known forms to the
extinct and unknown is very small, I have been astonished how rarely
an organ can be named, towards which no transitional grade is known to
lead.  The truth of this remark is indeed shown by that old canon in
natural history of 'Natura non facit saltum.' We meet with this
admission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or,
as Milne Edwards has well expressed it, nature is prodigal in variety,
but niggard in innovation. Why, on the theory of Creation, should this
be so? Why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings,
each supposed to have been separately created for its proper place in
nature, be so invariably linked together by graduated steps? Why
should not Nature have taken a leap from structure to structure? On
the theory of natural selection, we can clearly understand why she
should not; for natural selection can act  only by taking
advantage of slight successive variations; she can never take a leap,
but must advance by the shortest and slowest steps.
<P>
<I>Organs of little apparent importance.</I> 
As natural selection acts by life and death,   by the preservation
of individuals with any favourable variation, and by the destruction
of those with any unfavourable deviation of structure,   I have
sometimes felt much difficulty in 
understanding the origin of simple
parts, of which the importance does not seem sufficient to cause the
preservation of successively varying individuals. I have sometimes
felt as much difficulty, though of a very different kind, on this
head, as in the case of an organ as perfect and complex as the eye.

<P>
In the first place, we are much too
ignorant in regard to the whole economy of any one organic being, to
say what slight modifications would be of importance or not. In a
former chapter I have given instances of most trifling characters,
such as the down on fruit and the colour of the flesh, which, from
determining the attacks of insects or from being correlated with
constitutional differences, might assuredly be acted on by natural
selection. The tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially
constructed fly-flapper; and it seems at first incredible that this
could have been adapted for its present
purpose by successive slight modifications, each better and better,
for so trifling an object as driving away flies; yet we should pause
before being too positive even in this case, for we know that the
distribution and existence of cattle and other animals in South
America absolutely depends on their power of resisting the attacks of
insects: so that individuals which could by any means defend
themselves from these small enemies, would be able to range into new
pastures and thus gain a great advantage. It is not that the larger
quadrupeds are actually destroyed (except in some rare cases) by the
flies, but they are incessantly harassed and their strength reduced,
so that they are more subject to disease, or not so well enabled in a
coming dearth to search for food, or to escape from beasts of prey.

<P>
Organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been
of high importance to an early progenitor, and, after 
having been slowly perfected at a 
former period, have been transmitted
in nearly the same state, although now become of very slight use; and
any actually injurious deviations in their structure will always have
been checked by natural selection. Seeing how important an organ of
locomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals, its general presence
and use for many purposes in so many land animals, which in their
lungs or modified swim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may
perhaps be thus accounted for. A well-developed tail having been
formed in an aquatic animal, it might subsequently come to be worked
in for all sorts of purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ of
prehension, or as an aid in turning, as with the dog, though the aid
must be slight, for the hare, with hardly any tail, can double quickly
enough.

<P>
In the second place, we may sometimes attribute importance to
characters which are really of very little importance, and which have
originated from quite secondary causes, independently of natural
selection. We should remember that climate, food, &amp;c., probably
have some little direct influence on the organisation; that characters
reappear from the law of reversion;, that correlation of growth will
have had a most important influence in modifying various structures;
and finally, that sexual selection will often have largely modified
the external characters of animals having a will, to give one male an
advantage in fighting with another or in charming the females.
Moreover when a modification of structure has primarily arisen from
the above or other unknown causes, it may at first have been of no
advantage to the species, but may subsequently have been taken
advantage of by the descendants of the species under new conditions of
life and with newly acquired habits.

<P>
To give a few instances to illustrate
these latter 
remarks. If green woodpeckers alone had existed, and we
did not know that there were many black and pied kinds, I dare say
that we should have thought that the green colour was a beautiful
adaptation to hide this tree-frequenting bird from its enemies; and
consequently that it was a character of importance and might have been
acquired through natural selection; as it is, I have no doubt that the
colour is due to some quite distinct cause, probably to 
sexual selection. A trailing bamboo in the Malay Archipelago climbs
the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed 
hooks clustered around the ends of the branches,
and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest service to the
plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees which are not
climbers the hooks on the bamboo may have
arisen from unknown laws of growth, and have been subsequently taken
advantage of by the plant undergoing further modification and becoming
a climber. The naked skin on the head of a vulture is generally looked
at as a direct adaptation for wallowing in putridity; and so it may
be, or it may possibly be due to the direct action of putrid matter;
but we should be very cautious in drawing any such inference, when we
see that the skin on the head of the clean-feeding male turkey is
likewise naked. The sutures in the skulls of young mammals have been
advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding parturition, and no
doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable for this act; but as
sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles, which have
only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that this structure has
arisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken advantage of in the
parturition of the higher animals.

<P>
We are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and
unimportant variations; and we are immediately 
made conscious of this
by reflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated
animals in different countries,   more especially in the less
civilized countries where there has been but little artificial
selection. Careful observers are convinced that a damp climate affects
the growth of the hair, and that with the hair the horns are
correlated.  Mountain breeds always differ from lowland breeds; and a
mountainous country would probably affect the hind limbs from
exercising them more, and possibly even the form of the pelvis; and
then by the law of homologous variation, the front limbs and even the
head would probably be affected. The shape, also, of the pelvis might
affect by pressure the shape of the head of the young in the womb. The
laborious breathing necessary in high regions would, we have some
reason to believe, increase the size of the chest; and again
correlation would come into play. Animals kept by savages in different
 countries often have to struggle for their own
subsistence, and would be exposed to a certain extent to natural
selection, and individuals with slightly different constitutions would
succeed best under different climates; and there is reason to believe
that constitution and colour are correlated. A good observer, also,
states that in cattle susceptibility to the attacks of flies is
correlated with colour, as is the liability to be poisoned by certain
plants; so that colour would be thus subjected to the action of
natural selection.  But we are far too
ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the several known
and unknown laws of variation; and I have here alluded to them only to
show that, if we are unable to account for the characteristic
differences of our domestic breeds, which nevertheless we generally
admit to have arisen through ordinary generation, we ought not to lay
too much stress on our 
ignorance of the
precise cause of the slight analogous differences between species.  I
might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the
races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little
light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences,
chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without
here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.

<P>
The foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest
lately made by some naturalists, against the utilitarian doctrine that
every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its
possessor. They believe that very many structures have been created
for beauty in the eyes of man, or for mere variety. This doctrine, if
true, would be absolutely fatal to my theory. Yet I fully admit that
many structures are of no direct use to their possessors. Physical
conditions probably have had some little effect on structure, quite
independently of any good thus gained. Correlation of growth has no
doubt played a most important part, and a useful modification of one
part will often have entailed on other parts diversified changes of no
direct use. So again characters which
formerly were useful, or which formerly had arisen from correlation of
growth, or from other unknown cause, may reappear from the law of
reversion, though now of no direct use. The effects of sexual
selection, when  displayed in beauty to charm the females,
can be called useful only in rather a forced sense. But by far the
most important consideration is that the chief part of the
organisation of every being is simply due to inheritance; and
consequently, though each being assuredly is well fitted for its place
in nature, many structures now have no direct relation to the habits
of life of each species. Thus, we can hardly believe that the webbed
feet of the upland 
goose or of the frigate-bird are of special use to
these birds; we cannot believe that the same bones in the arm of the
monkey, in the fore leg of the horse, in the wing of the bat, and in
the flipper of the seal, are of special use to these animals. We may
safely attribute these structures to inheritance. But to the
progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigate-bird, webbed feet no
doubt were as useful as they now are to the most aquatic of existing
birds. So we may believe that the progenitor of the seal had not a
flipper, but a foot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping; and
we may further venture to believe that the several bones in the limbs
of the monkey, horse, and bat, which have been inherited from a common
progenitor, were formerly of more special use to that progenitor, or
its progenitors, than they now are to these animals having such widely
diversified habits. Therefore we may infer that these several bones
might have been acquired through natural selection, subjected
formerly, as now, to the several laws of inheritance, reversion,
correlation of growth, &amp;c.  Hence every detail of structure in
every living creature (making some little allowance for the direct
action of physical conditions) may be viewed, either as having been of
special use to some ancestral form, or as being now of special use to
the descendants of this form   either directly, or indirectly
through the complex laws of growth.

<P>
Natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in any
one species exclusively for the good of another species; though
throughout nature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and
profits by, the structure of another. But natural selection can and
does often produce structures for the direct injury of other species,
as we see in the fang of the adder, and in the ovipositor of the
ichneumon, by which its eggs are deposited 
in the living bodies of
other insects. If it could be proved  that any part of the
structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of
another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not
have been produced through natural selection. Although many statements
may be found in works on natural history to this effect, I cannot find
even one which seems to me of any weight. It is admitted that the
rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own defence and for the
destruction of its prey; but some authors suppose that at the same
time this snake is furnished with a rattle for its own injury, namely,
to warn its prey to escape. I would almost as soon believe that the
cat curls the end of its tail when preparing to spring, in order to
warn the doomed mouse. But I have not space here to enter on this and
other such cases.

<P>
Natural selection will never produce in a being anything injurious
to itself, for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of
each. No organ will be formed, as Paley has remarked, for the purpose
of causing pain or for doing an injury to its possessor. If a fair
balance be struck between the good and evil caused by each part, each
will be found on the whole advantageous. After the lapse of time,
under changing conditions of life, if any part comes to be injurious,
it will be modified; or if it be not so, the being will become
extinct, as myriads have become extinct.

<P>
Natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect
as, or slightly more perfect than, the other inhabitants of the same
country with which it has to struggle for existence. And we see that
this is the degree of perfection attained under nature. The endemic
productions of New Zealand, for instance, are perfect one compared
with another; but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing
legions of plants 
and animals introduced from Europe.  Natural
selection will not produce absolute perfection, nor do we always meet,
as far as we can judge, with this high standard under nature. The
correction for the aberration of light is said, on high authority, not
to be perfect even in that most perfect organ, the eye. If our reason
leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable
contrivances in nature, this same reason tells us, though we may
easily err on both sides, that some other contrivances are less
perfect.  Can we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee
as perfect, which, when used against many attacking animals, cannot be
withdrawn, owing to the backward serratures, and so inevitably causes
the death of the insect by tearing out its viscera?

<P>
If we look at the sting of the bee, as having originally existed in
a remote progenitor as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in
so many members of the same great order,
and which has been modified but not perfected for its present purpose,
with the poison originally adapted to cause galls subsequently
intensified, we can perhaps understand how it is that the use of the
sting should so often cause the insect's own death: for if on the
whole the power of stinging be useful to the community, it will fulfil
all the requirements of natural selection, though it may cause the
death of some few members. If we admire the truly wonderful power of
scent by which the males of many insects find their females, can we
admire the production for this single purpose of thousands of drones,
which are utterly useless to the community for any other end, and
which are ultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile
sisters? It may be difficult, but we ought to admire the savage
instinctive hatred of the queen-bee, which urges her instantly to
destroy the 
young queens her daughters as soon as born, or to perish
herself in the combat; for undoubtedly this is for the good of the
community; and maternal love or maternal hatred, though the latter
fortunately is most rare, is all the same to the inexorable principle
of natural selection. If we admire the several ingenious contrivances,
by which the flowers of the orchis and of many other plants are
fertilised through insect agency, can we consider as equally perfect
the elaboration by our fir-trees of dense clouds of pollen, in order
that a few granules may be wafted by a chance breeze on to the ovules?
<P>
<I>Summary of Chapter.</I> 
We have in this
chapter discussed some of the difficulties and objections which may be
urged against my theory. Many of them are very grave; but I think that
in the discussion light has been thrown on several facts, which on the
theory of independent acts of creation are utterly obscure. We
have seen that species at any one period are not indefinitely
variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of intermediate
gradations, partly because the process of natural selection will
always be very slow, and will act, at any one time, only on a very few
forms; and partly because the very process of natural selection almost
implies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and
intermediate gradations.  Closely allied species, now living on a
continuous area, must often have been formed when the area was not
continuous, and when the conditions of life did not insensibly
graduate away from one part to another. When two varieties are formed
in two districts of a continuous area, an intermediate variety will
often be formed, fitted for an intermediate zone; but from reasons
assigned, the intermediate variety will usually exist in lesser
numbers than 
the two forms which it connects; consequently the two
latter, during the course of further modification, from existing in
greater numbers, will have a great advantage over the less numerous
intermediate variety, and will thus generally succeed in supplanting
and exterminating it.

<P>
We have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in
concluding that the most different habits of life could not graduate
into each other; that a bat, for instance, could not have been formed
by natural selection from an animal which at first could only glide
through the air.

<P>
We have seen that a species may under new conditions of life change
its habits, or have diversified habits, with some habits very unlike
those of its nearest congeners.  Hence we can understand bearing in
mind that each organic being is trying to live wherever it can live,
how it has arisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet, ground
woodpeckers, diving thrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks.

<P>
Although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have
been formed by natural selection, is more than enough to stagger any
one; yet in the case of any organ, if we know of a long series of
gradations in complexity, each good for its possessor, then, under
changing conditions of life, there is no logical impossibility in the
acquirement of any conceivable degree of perfection through natural
selection. In the cases in  which we know of no
intermediate or transitional states, we should be very cautious in
concluding that none could have existed, for the homologies of many
organs and their intermediate states show that wonderful metamorphoses
in function are at least possible. For instance, a swim-bladder has
apparently been converted into an air-breathing lung. The same organ
having performed 
simultaneously very different functions, and then
having been specialised for one function; and two very distinct organs
having performed at the same time the same function, the one having
been perfected whilst aided by the other, must often have largely
facilitated transitions.

<P>
We are far too ignorant, in almost every
case, to be enabled to assert that any part or organ is so unimportant
for the welfare of a species, that modifications in its structure
could not have been slowly accumulated by means of natural selection.
But we may confidently believe that many modifications, wholly due to
the laws of growth, and at first in no way advantageous to a species,
have been subsequently taken advantage of by the still further
modified descendants of this species. We may, also, believe that a
part formerly of high importance has often been retained (as the tail
of an aquatic animal by its terrestrial descendants), though it has
become of such small importance that it could not, in its present
state, have been acquired by natural selection,   a power which
acts solely by the preservation of profitable variations in the
struggle for life.

<P>
Natural selection will produce nothing in one species for the
exclusive good or injury of another; though it may well produce parts,
organs, and excretions highly useful or even indispensable, or highly
injurious to another species, but in all cases at the same time useful
to the owner. Natural selection in each well-stocked country, must act
chiefly through the competition of the inhabitants one with another,
and consequently will produce perfection, or strength in the battle
for life, only according to the standard of that country. Hence the
inhabitants of one country, generally the smaller one, will often
yield, as we see they do yield, to the inhabitants of another and
generally larger country. For in 
the larger country there will have
existed more individuals, and more diversified forms, and the
competition will  have been severer, and thus the standard
of perfection will have been rendered higher. Natural selection will
not necessarily produce absolute perfection; nor, as far as we can
judge by our limited faculties, can absolute perfection be everywhere
found.

<P>
On the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the
full meaning of that old canon in natural
history, 'Natura non facit saltum.' This canon, if we look only to the
present inhabitants of the world, is not strictly correct, but if we
include all those of past times, it must by my theory be strictly
true.

<P>
It is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been
formed on two great laws   Unity of Type, and the Conditions of
Existence. By unity of type is meant that fundamental agreement in
structure, which we see in organic beings of the same class, and which
is quite independent of their habits of life. On my theory, unity of
type is explained by unity of descent. The
expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted on by the
illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of natural
selection. For natural selection acts by either now adapting the
varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of
life; or by having adapted them during long-past periods of time: the
adaptations being aided in some cases by use and disuse, being
slightly affected by the direct action of the external conditions of
life, and being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth.
Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is the higher
law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former adaptations,
that of Unity of Type.
