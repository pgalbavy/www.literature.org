<p>And now comes a change of scene and incident.</p>

<p>Hugh Whitney returned to his Maine home a few weeks after the
stirring adventures of his children and Monteith Sterry with the
wolves. He was so pleased with the western country that he made
his decision to remove thither. He met with no difficulty in selling
at a fair price his little property in the Pine-Tree State, and
with a portion of the proceeds he bought a ranch near the headwaters
of Powder River, to which place he removed, with his family, in
the spring of 1890, directly after the incidents related in the
preceding chapters.</p>

<p>One of the pleasures of this radical change of residence and
occupation was that it was pleasing to his son Fred and his twin
sister Jennie, now about nineteen years of age.</p>

<p>Whether the wife shared in the desire to make her home in that
new country, or whether she expressed the wish to do so because
she saw it would gratify her husband, cannot be said with certainty.
There was no doubt, however, about the eagerness with which the
brother and sister took part in the removal.</p>

<p>Young, ardent, and of sturdy frame, with all the natural yearning
of imaginative youth for adventure, the prospect was an inviting
one to them. Their father's glowing accounts of the magnificent
scenery, its vast resources and limitless possibilities, caused
a yearning on their part probably deeper than his own.</p>

<p>It is rare that such expectations are fully realized in this
life. It cannot be said that those of the brother and sister found
more than a partial fulfilment, but, though the fateful day came
when they regretted the change beyond the power of language to
express, yet it was many months before it dawned upon them.</p>

<p>Hugh Whitney's herd of cattle numbered several thousand, and,
on the day when we take up the eventful history of the family,
they were grazing on the open ranges along the spurs of the Big
Horn Mountains.</p>

<p>The two cowmen engaged by Whitney to assist him in the duty of
looking after his property were Budd Hankinson and Grizzly Weber.
They were veterans in the business, brave and true and tried.
Under their tuition, and that of his father, Fred Whitney became
a skilful horseman and rancher. He learned to lasso and bring
down an obdurate steer, to give valuable help in the round-ups,
to assist in branding the registered trademark of his father on
the haunches of his animals.</p>

<p>This brand consisted of a cross, with two stars above, one below,
the initial letter of his given name on the left, and that of
his surname on the right. When this was burned into the flesh
of the yearlings, it identified his property, no matter where
wandering, and the honest rancher would no more disturb it than
he would enter another's home and rob him of his clothing.</p>

<p>The first year was an enjoyable one to Jennie. Her father presented
her with an excellent animal, of which she became very fond. A
good horsewoman when in Maine, in Wyoming she acquired a skill
which compelled the admiration of the cowmen themselves.</p>

<p>"She's struck her callin'," remarked Budd Hankinson one day,
while watching her speeding like a courser across the open country.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked the father, who was proud of his children,
and especially of the pretty daughter.</p>

<p>"Why, riding hosses like a streak of lightnin'," was the somewhat
indefinite response.</p>

<p>"What particular profession can she fill by dashing over the
country in that style?" continued the parent with a smile.</p>

<p>"Why, showing other persons how it is done. I've no doubt, colonel,
that she could make good wages in breaking broncos and teaching
young women like her how to ride in the right style; I advise
you to think about it."</p>

<p>"I will do so," replied the parent, with so much gravity that
the cowman never suspected his sincerity, but felt the satisfaction
of believing he had given his employer a valuable "pointer."</p>

<p>Another pleasure which followed the removal of the Whitneys to
Wyoming was that their friend Monteith Sterry followed them within
a few months. He had shown some signs of running down in health
while attending the high school in Boston, despite the fact that
he was one of the best athletes in the institution; but he readily
persuaded his wealthy father that a few months' experience in
the bracing northwest would do him more good than anything and
everything else in the world.</p>

<p>That he might have some pretext other than the one which could
not wholly deceive the Whitneys, he engaged to serve the Live
Stock Association, which was beginning to have trouble with the
rustlers. Matters were not only going wrong, but were rapidly
getting worse in Wyoming, and they were glad to secure the services
of such a daring and honest youth, who seemed rather to welcome
the fact that he could perform his duties faithfully only at personal
risk to himself.</p>

<p>It need not be explained how it came about that young Sterry
found it necessary to give a great deal of his attention to that
section of Wyoming in which the Whitneys lived. There appeared
to be more need of it there than in any of the other neighborhoods
where the outlook was really threatening.</p>

<p>The natural consequence was that he became a frequent visitor
at the home of his former friend, though he found other acquaintances
engaged in the cattle business who were glad to have him take
shelter under their roofs. Sometimes he engaged in hunting with
them, and several times Fred Whitney and Jennie joined him. There
was a spice of peril in these excursions which rendered them fascinating
to all three.</p>

<p>The particular day to which we refer was a mild afternoon in
May, 1892. Jennie was helping her mother with her household duties
in their home, where they had lived since coming from their native
State. The building was one of the long, low wooden structures
common in that section, to which the fashions of the older civilization
have not yet penetrated. It possessed all the comforts they required,
though it took some time for the brother and sister to accustom
themselves to the odd style of architecture.</p>

<p>Jennie, as usual, was in high spirits. She had been out for a
ride during the forenoon, and was now trying to make up for it
by taking the burden of most of the work upon her comely shoulders.</p>

<p>In the middle of one of her snatches of song she abruptly paused
with the question:</p>

<p>"Did you hear that, mother?"</p>

<p>"No; to what do you refer?"</p>

<p>"The sound of rifle-firing; something is wrong on the range."</p>

<p>The two paused and listened, looking in each other's pale countenances
as they did so.</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> rifle-firing!" said Mrs. Whitney in a scared
voice; "what can it mean?"</p>

<p>"Trouble with the rustlers," replied Jennie, hurrying through
the open door to the outside that she might hear the better. Her
mother followed, and the two stood side by side, listening and
peering across the wide stretch of undulating plain in the direction
of the mountains, whose wooded crests were outlined against the
clear spring sky.</p>

<p>There could be no mistaking the alarming sounds. They were made
by rifles, fired sometimes in quick succession, often mingling
with each other, and then showing comparatively long intervals
between the discharges of the weapons.</p>

<p>"Father said the rustlers were becoming bolder," remarked Jennie,
"and there was sure to be trouble with them before long."</p>

<p>"It has come," was the comment of the parent, "and who shall
tell the result?"</p>

<p>"It cannot last long, mother."</p>

<p>"A few minutes is a good while at such a time. A score of shots
have already been fired, and some of them must have done execution."</p>

<p>"Father, Fred and our two men are unerring shots."</p>

<p>"And so are they," responded the mother, referring to the rustlers,
who have made so much trouble for the cattlemen of Wyoming.</p>
