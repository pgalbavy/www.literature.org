<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Shotwell Junior discovered in due course of time the memoranda
of the repeated messages which Palla had telephoned to his several
clubs, asking him to call her up immediately.</p>

<p>It was rather late to do that now, but his pulses began to quicken
again in the old, hopeless way; and he went to the telephone booth
and called the number which seemed burnt into his brain forever.</p>

<p>A maid answered; Palla came presently; and he thought her voice
seemed colourless and unfamiliar.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm perfectly well," she replied to his inquiry; "where
in the world did you go that night? I simply couldn't find you
anywhere."</p>

<p>"What had you wished to say to me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;except&mdash;that I was afraid you were angry when you left,
and I didn't wish you to part with me on such terms. Were you
annoyed?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You say it very curtly, Jim."</p>

<p>"Is that all you desired to say to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... I was a little troubled.... Something else went wrong,
too;&mdash;everything seemed to go wrong that night.... I thought perhaps&mdash;if
I could hear your voice&mdash;if you'd say something kind&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Had you nothing else to tell me, Palla?"</p>

<p>"No.... What?"</p>

<p>"Then you haven't changed your attitude?"</p>

<p>"Toward you? I don't expect to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You know what I mean!"</p>

<p>"Oh. But, Jim, we can't discuss <em>that</em> over the telephone."</p>

<p>"I suppose not.... Is anything wrong with you, Palla? Your voice
sounds so tired&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Does it? I don't know why. Tell me, please, what did you do
that unhappy night?"</p>

<p>"I went home."</p>

<p>"Directly?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I telephoned your house about twelve, and was informed you were
not at home."</p>

<p>"They thought I was asleep. I'm sorry, Palla&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have telephoned so late," she interrupted, "I'm
afraid that it was your mother who answered; and if it was, I
received the snub I deserved!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! It wasn't meant that way&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it was, Jim. It's quite all right, though. I won't
do it again.... Am I to see you soon?"</p>

<p>"No, not for a while&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Are you so busy?"</p>

<p>"There's no use in my going to you, Palla."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm in love with you," he said bluntly, "and I'm trying
to get over it."</p>

<p>"I thought we were <em>friends</em>, too."</p>

<p>After a lengthy silence: "You're right," he said, "we are."</p>

<p>She heard his quick, deep breath like a sigh. "Shall I come to-night?"</p>

<p>"I'm expecting some people, Jim&mdash;women who desire to establish
a Combat Club in Chicago, and they have come on here to consult
me."</p>

<p>"To-morrow night, then?"</p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p>"Will you be alone?"</p>

<p>"I expect to be."</p>

<p>Once more he said: "Palla, is anything worrying you? Are you
ill? Is Ilse all right?"</p>

<p>There was a pause, then Palla's voice, resolutely tranquil. "Everything
is all right in the world as long as you are kind to me, Jim.
When you're not, things darken and become queer&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Palla!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Listen! This is to serve notice on you. I'm going to make a
fight for you."</p>

<p>After a silence, he heard her sweet, uncertain laughter.</p>

<p>"Jim?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"I suppose it would shock you if I made a fight for&mdash;<em>you</em>!"</p>

<p>He took it as a jest and laughed at her perverse humour. But
what she had meant she herself scarcely realised; and she turned
away from the telephone, conscious of a vague excitement invading
her and of a vaguer consternation, too. For behind the humorous
audacity of her words, she seemed to realise there remained something
hidden&mdash;something she was on the verge of discovering&mdash;something
indefinable, menacing, grave enough to dismay her and drive from
her lips the last traces of the smile which her audacious jest
had left there.</p>

<p>The ladies from Chicago were to dine with her; her maid had hooked
her gown; orchids from Jim had just arrived, and she was still
pinning them to her waist&mdash;still happily thrilled by this lovely
symbol of their renewed accord, when the bell rang.</p>

<p>It was much too early to expect anybody: she fastened her orchids
and started to descend the stairs for a last glance at the table,
when, to her astonishment, she saw Angelo Puma in the hall in
the act of depositing his card upon the salver extended by the
maid.</p>

<p>He looked up and saw her before she could retreat: she made the
best of it and continued on down, greeting him with inquiring
amiability:</p>

<p>"Miss Dumont, a thousand excuses for this so bold intrusion,"
he began, bowing extravagantly at every word. "Only the urgent
importance of my errand could possibly atone for a presumption
like there never has been in all&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Please step into the drawing room, Mr. Puma, if you have something
of importance to say."</p>

<p>He followed her on tiptoe, flashing his magnificent eyes about
the place, still wearing over his evening dress the seal overcoat
with its gardenia, which was already making him famous on Broadway.</p>

<p>Palla seated herself, wondering a little at the perfumed splendour
of her landlord. He sat on the extreme edge of an arm chair, his
glossy hat on his knee.</p>

<p>"Miss Dumont," he said, laying one white-gloved paw across his
shirt-front, "you shall behold in me a desolate man!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry." She looked at him in utter perplexity.</p>

<p>"What shall you say to me?" he cried. "What just reproaches shall
you address to me, Miss Dumont!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know, Mr. Puma," she said, inclined to laugh,
"&mdash;until you tell me what is your errand."</p>

<p>"Miss Dumont, I am most unhappy and embarrass. Because you have
pay me in advance for that which I am unable to offer you."</p>

<p>"I don't think I understand."</p>

<p>"Alas! You have pay to me by cheque for six months more rent
of my hall."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I have given to you a lease for six months more, and with it
an option for a year of renewal."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Miss Dumont, behold me desolate."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Because I am force by circumstance over which I have no control
to cancel this lease and option, and ask you most respectfully
to be so kind as to secure other quarters for your club."</p>

<p>"But we can't do that!" exclaimed Palla in dismay.</p>

<p>"I am so very sorry&#11834;"</p>

<p>"We can't do it," added Palla with decision. "It's utterly impossible,
Mr. Puma. All our meetings are arranged for months in advance;
all the details are completed. We could not disarrange the programme
adopted. From all over the United States people are invited to
come on certain fixed dates. All arrangements have been made;
you have my cheque and I have your signed lease. No, we are obliged
to hold you to your contract, and I'm very sorry if it inconveniences
you."</p>

<p>Puma's brilliant eyes became tenderly apprehensive.</p>

<p>"Miss Dumont," he said in a hushed and confidential voice, "believe
me when I venture to say to you that your club should leave for
reasons most grave, most serious."</p>

<p>"What reasons?"</p>

<p>"The others&mdash;the Red Flag Club. Who knows what such crazy people
might do in anger? They are very angry already. They complain
that your club has interfere with them&#11834;"</p>

<p>"That is exactly why we're there, Mr. Puma&mdash;to interfere with
them, neutralise their propaganda, try to draw the same people
who listen to their violent tirades. That is why we're there,
and why we refuse to leave. Ours is a crusade of education. We
chose that hall because we desired to make the fight in the very
camp of the enemy. And I must tell you plainly that we shall not
give up our lease, and that we shall hold you to it."</p>

<p>The dark blood flooded his heavy features:</p>

<p>"I do not desire to take it to the courts," he said. "I am willing
to offer compensation."</p>

<p>"We couldn't accept. Don't you understand, Mr. Puma? We simply
must have that particular hall for the Combat Club."</p>

<p>Puma remained perfectly silent for a few moments. There was still,
on his thick lips, the suave smile which had been stamped there
since his appearance in her house.</p>

<p>But in this man's mind and heart there was growing a sort of
dull and ferocious fear&mdash;fear of elements already gathering and
combining to menace his increasing prosperity.</p>

<p>Sullenly he was aware that this hard-won prosperity was threatened.
Always its conditions had been unstable at best, but now the atmospheric
pressure was slowly growing, and his sky of promise was not as
clear.</p>

<p>Some way, somehow, he must manage to evict these women. Twice
Sondheim had warned him. And that evening Sondheim had sent him
an ultimatum by Kastner.</p>

<p>And Puma was perfectly aware that Karl Kastner knew enough about
him to utterly ruin him in the great Republic which was now giving
him a fortune and which had never discovered that his own treacherous
mission here was the accomplishment of her ruin.</p>

</div>
<p>Puma stood up, heavily, cradling his glossy hat. But his urbane
smile became brilliant again and he made Palla an extravagant
bow.</p>

<p>"It shall be arrange," he said cheerfully. "I consult my partner&mdash;your
<em>friend</em>, Mr. Skidder! Yes! So shall we arrive at entente."</p>

<p>His large womanish eyes swept the room. Suddenly they were arrested
by a photograph of Shotwell Junior&mdash;in a silver frame&mdash;the only
ornament, as yet, in the little drawing room.</p>

<p>And instantly, within Angelo Puma, the venomous instinct was
aroused to do injury where it might be done safely and without
suspicion of intent.</p>

<p>"Ah," he exclaimed gaily, "my friend, Mr. Shotwell! It is from
him, Miss Dumont, you have purchase this so beautiful residence!"</p>

<p>He bent to salute with a fanciful inclination the photograph
of the man who had spoken so contemptuously of him the evening
previous.</p>

<p>"Mr. Shotwell also adores gaiety," he said laughingly. "Last
night I beheld him at the Palace of Mirrors&mdash;and with an attractive
young lady of your club, Miss Dumont&mdash;the charming young Russian
lady with whom you came once to pay me the rent&mdash;" He kissed his
hand in an ecstasy of recollection. "So beautiful a young lady!
So gay were they in their box! Ah, youth! youth! Ah, the happiness
and folly when laughter bubbles in our wine!&mdash;the magic wine of
youth!"</p>

<p>He took his leave, moving lightly to the door, almost grotesque
in his elaborate evolutions and adieux.</p>

<p>Palla went slowly upstairs.</p>

<p>The evening paper lay on a table in the living room. She unfolded
it mechanically; looked at it but saw no print, merely an unsteady
haze of greyish tint on which she could not seem to concentrate.</p>

<p>Marya and Jim ... together.... That was the night he went away
angry.... The night he told her he had gone directly home....
But it couldn't have been.... He couldn't have lied....</p>

<p>She strove to recollect as she sat there staring at the newspaper....
What was it that beast had said about it?... Of course&mdash;<em>last</em>
night!... Marya and Jim had been together last night.... But where
was Vanya?... Oh, yes.... Last night Vanya was away ... in Baltimore.</p>

<p>The paper dropped to her lap; she sat looking straight ahead
of her.</p>

<p>What had so shocked her then about Jim and Marya being together?
True, she had not supposed them to be on such terms&mdash;had not even
thought about it....</p>

<p>Yes, she <em>had</em> thought about it, scarcely conscious of
her own indefinable uneasiness&mdash;a memory, perhaps, of that evening
when the Russian girl had been at little pains to disguise her
interest in this man. And Palla had noticed it&mdash;noticed that Marya
was seated too near him&mdash;noticed that, and the subtle attitude
of provocation, and the stealthy evolution of that occult sorcery
which one woman instantly divines in another and finds slightly
revolting.</p>

<p>Was it merely that memory which had been evoked when Puma's laughing
revelation so oddly chilled her?&mdash;the suspected and discovered
predilection of this Russian girl for Jim? Or was it something
else, something deeper, some sudden and more profound illumination
which revealed to her that, in the depths of her, she was afraid?</p>

<p>Afraid? Afraid of what?</p>

<p>Her charming young head sank; the brown eyes stared at the floor.</p>

<p>She was beginning to understand what had chilled her, what she
had unconsciously been afraid of&mdash;<em>her own creed!</em>&mdash;when
applied to another woman.</p>

<p>And this was the second time that this creed of hers had risen
to confront her, and the second time she had gazed at it, chilled
by fear: once, when she had waited for Ilse to return; and now
once again.</p>

<p>For now she began to comprehend how ruthless that creed could
become when professed by such a girl as Marya Lanois.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>She was still seated there when Marya came in, her tiger-red
hair in fascinating disorder from the wind, her skin fairly breathing
the warm fragrance of exotic youth.</p>

<p>"My Palla! How pale you seem!" she exclaimed, embracing her.
"You are quite well? Really? Then I am reassured!"</p>

<p>She went to the mirror and tucked in a burnished strand or two
of hair.</p>

<p>"These Chicago ladies&mdash;they have not arrived, I see. Am I then
so early? For I see that Ilse is not yet here&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It is only a quarter to eight," said Palla, smiling; but the
brown eyes were calmly measuring this lithe and warm and lovely
thing with green eyes&mdash;measuring it intently&mdash;taking its measure&mdash;taking,
for the first time in her life, her measure of any woman.</p>

<p>"Was Vanya's concert a great success?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Vanya has not yet returned." She shrugged. "There was nothing
in New York papers."</p>

<p>"I suppose you were very nervous last night," said Palla.</p>

<p>For a moment Marya continued to arrange her hair by the aid of
the mantel mirror, then she turned very lithely and let her green
gaze rest full on Palla's face.</p>

<p>What she might possibly have divined was hidden behind the steady
brown eyes that met hers may have determined her attitude and
words; for she laughed with frank carelessness and plunged into
it all:</p>

<p>"Fancy, Palla, my encountering Jim Shotwell in the Biltmore,
and dining with him at that noisy Palace of Mirrors last night!
Did he tell you?"</p>

<p>"I haven't seen him."</p>

<p>" &mdash;Over the telephone, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No, he did not mention it."</p>

<p>"Well, it was most amusing. It is the unpremeditated that is
delightful. And can you see us in that dreadful place, as gay
as a pair of school children? And we must laugh at nothing and
find it enchanting&mdash;and we must dance amid the hoi polloi and
clap our hands for the encore too!&#11834;"</p>

<p>A light peal of laughter floated from her lips at the recollections
evoked:</p>

<p>"And after! Can you see us, Palla, in Vanya's studio, too wide
awake to go our ways!&mdash;and the song I sang at that unearthly hour&mdash;the
song I sing always when happily excited&#11834;"</p>

<p>The bell rang; the first guest had arrived.</p>
