<p>I inscribe this book of adventure to my son ARTHUR JOHN RIDER HAGGARD in
the hope that in days to come he, and many other boys whom I shall
never know, may, in the acts and thoughts of Allan Quatermain and his
companions, as herein recorded, find something to help him and them
to reach to what, with Sir Henry Curtis, I hold to be the highest rank
whereto we can attain--the state and dignity of English gentlemen.

<p>December 23
</p><p>‘I have just buried my boy, my poor handsome boy of whom I was so proud,
and my heart is broken. It is very hard having only one son to lose him
thus, but God’s will be done. Who am I that I should complain? The great
wheel of Fate rolls on like a Juggernaut, and crushes us all in turn,
some soon, some late--it does not matter when, in the end, it crushes us
all. We do not prostrate ourselves before it like the poor Indians; we
fly hither and thither--we cry for mercy; but it is of no use, the black
Fate thunders on and in its season reduces us to powder.
</p><p>‘Poor Harry to go so soon! just when his life was opening to him. He was
doing so well at the hospital, he had passed his last examination with
honours, and I was proud of them, much prouder than he was, I think. And
then he must needs go to that smallpox hospital. He wrote to me that he
was not afraid of smallpox and wanted to gain the experience; and now
the disease has killed him, and I, old and grey and withered, am left
to mourn over him, without a chick or child to comfort me. I might have
saved him, too--I have money enough for both of us, and much more than
enough--King Solomon’s Mines provided me with that; but I said, “No, let
the boy earn his living, let him labour that he may enjoy rest.” But the
rest has come to him before the labour. Oh, my boy, my boy!
</p><p>‘I am like the man in the Bible who laid up much goods and builded
barns--goods for my boy and barns for him to store them in; and now his
soul has been required of him, and I am left desolate. I would that it
had been my soul and not my boy’s!
</p><p>‘We buried him this afternoon under the shadow of the grey and ancient
tower of the church of this village where my house is. It was a dreary
December afternoon, and the sky was heavy with snow, but not much was
falling. The coffin was put down by the grave, and a few big flakes lit
upon it. They looked very white upon the black cloth! There was a little
hitch about getting the coffin down into the grave--the necessary ropes
had been forgotten: so we drew back from it, and waited in silence
watching the big flakes fall gently one by one like heavenly
benedictions, and melt in tears on Harry’s pall. But that was not all.
A robin redbreast came as bold as could be and lit upon the coffin and
began to sing. And then I am afraid that I broke down, and so did Sir
Henry Curtis, strong man though he is; and as for Captain Good, I saw
him turn away too; even in my own distress I could not help noticing
it.’
</p>
<p>The above, signed ‘Allan Quatermain’, is an extract from my diary
written two years and more ago. I copy it down here because it seems to
me that it is the fittest beginning to the history that I am about to
write, if it please God to spare me to finish it. If not, well it does
not matter. That extract was penned seven thousand miles or so from the
spot where I now lie painfully and slowly writing this, with a pretty
girl standing by my side fanning the flies from my august countenance.
Harry is there and I am here, and yet somehow I cannot help feeling that
I am not far off Harry.
</p><p>When I was in England I used to live in a very fine house--at least
I call it a fine house, speaking comparatively, and judging from
the standard of the houses I have been accustomed to all my life in
Africa--not five hundred yards from the old church where Harry is
asleep, and thither I went after the funeral and ate some food; for it
is no good starving even if one has just buried all one’s earthly
hopes. But I could not eat much, and soon I took to walking, or rather
limping--being permanently lame from the bite of a lion--up and down,
up and down the oak-panelled vestibule; for there is a vestibule in my
house in England. On all the four walls of this vestibule were placed
pairs of horns--about a hundred pairs altogether, all of which I had
shot myself. They are beautiful specimens, as I never keep any horns
which are not in every way perfect, unless it may be now and again on
account of the associations connected with them. In the centre of the
room, however, over the wide fireplace, there was a clear space left on
which I had fixed up all my rifles. Some of them I have had for forty
years, old muzzle-loaders that nobody would look at nowadays. One was an
elephant gun with strips of rimpi, or green hide, lashed round the stock
and locks, such as used to be owned by the Dutchmen--a ‘roer’ they call
it. That gun, the Boer I bought it from many years ago told me, had been
used by his father at the battle of the Blood River, just after Dingaan
swept into Natal and slaughtered six hundred men, women, and children,
so that the Boers named the place where they died ‘Weenen’, or the
‘Place of Weeping’; and so it is called to this day, and always will be
called. And many an elephant have I shot with that old gun. She always
took a handful of black powder and a three-ounce ball, and kicked like
the very deuce.
</p><p>Well, up and down I walked, staring at the guns and the horns which
the guns had brought low; and as I did so there rose up in me a great
craving:--I would go away from this place where I lived idly and at
ease, back again to the wild land where I had spent my life, where I met
my dear wife and poor Harry was born, and so many things, good, bad, and
indifferent, had happened to me. The thirst for the wilderness was on
me; I could tolerate this place no more; I would go and die as I had
lived, among the wild game and the savages. Yes, as I walked, I began to
long to see the moonlight gleaming silvery white over the wide veldt and
mysterious sea of bush, and watch the lines of game travelling down the
ridges to the water. The ruling passion is strong in death, they say,
and my heart was dead that night. But, independently of my trouble, no
man who has for forty years lived the life I have, can with impunity go
coop himself in this prim English country, with its trim hedgerows
and cultivated fields, its stiff formal manners, and its well-dressed
crowds. He begins to long--ah, how he longs!--for the keen breath of the
desert air; he dreams of the sight of Zulu impis breaking on their foes
like surf upon the rocks, and his heart rises up in rebellion against
the strict limits of the civilized life.
</p><p>Ah! this civilization, what does it all come to? For forty years and
more I lived among savages, and studied them and their ways; and now for
several years I have lived here in England, and have in my own stupid
manner done my best to learn the ways of the children of light; and what
have I found? A great gulf fixed? No, only a very little one, that a
plain man’s thought may spring across. I say that as the savage is, so
is the white man, only the latter is more inventive, and possesses the
faculty of combination; save and except also that the savage, as I have
known him, is to a large extent free from the greed of money, which
eats like a cancer into the heart of the white man. It is a depressing
conclusion, but in all essentials the savage and the child of
civilization are identical. I dare say that the highly civilized lady
reading this will smile at an old fool of a hunter’s simplicity when
she thinks of her black bead-bedecked sister; and so will the superfine
cultured idler scientifically eating a dinner at his club, the cost of
which would keep a starving family for a week. And yet, my dear young
lady, what are those pretty things round your own neck?--they have a
strong family resemblance, especially when you wear that <u>very</u> low
dress, to the savage woman’s beads. Your habit of turning round and
round to the sound of horns and tom-toms, your fondness for pigments
and powders, the way in which you love to subjugate yourself to the rich
warrior who has captured you in marriage, and the quickness with which
your taste in feathered head-dresses varies--all these things suggest
touches of kinship; and you remember that in the fundamental principles
of your nature you are quite identical. As for you, sir, who also laugh,
let some man come and strike you in the face whilst you are enjoying
that marvellous-looking dish, and we shall soon see how much of the
savage there is in <u>you</u>.
</p><p>There, I might go on for ever, but what is the good? Civilization is
only savagery silver-gilt. A vainglory is it, and like a northern
light, comes but to fade and leave the sky more dark. Out of the soil
of barbarism it has grown like a tree, and, as I believe, into the
soil like a tree it will once more, sooner or later, fall again, as the
Egyptian civilization fell, as the Hellenic civilization fell, and as
the Roman civilization and many others of which the world has now lost
count, fell also. Do not let me, however, be understood as decrying our
modern institutions, representing as they do the gathered experience
of humanity applied for the good of all. Of course they have great
advantages--hospitals for instance; but then, remember, we breed
the sickly people who fill them. In a savage land they do not exist.
Besides, the question will arise: How many of these blessings are due to
Christianity as distinct from civilization? And so the balance sways and
the story runs--here a gain, there a loss, and Nature’s great average
struck across the two, whereof the sum total forms one of the factors in
that mighty equation in which the result will equal the unknown quantity
of her purpose.
</p><p>I make no apology for this digression, especially as this is an
introduction which all young people and those who never like to think
(and it is a bad habit) will naturally skip. It seems to me very
desirable that we should sometimes try to understand the limitations
of our nature, so that we may not be carried away by the pride of
knowledge. Man’s cleverness is almost indefinite, and stretches like an
elastic band, but human nature is like an iron ring. You can go round
and round it, you can polish it highly, you can even flatten it a little
on one side, whereby you will make it bulge out the other, but you will
<u>never</u>, while the world endures and man is man, increase its total
circumference. It is the one fixed unchangeable thing--fixed as the
stars, more enduring than the mountains, as unalterable as the way of
the Eternal. Human nature is God’s kaleidoscope, and the little bits
of coloured glass which represent our passions, hopes, fears, joys,
aspirations towards good and evil and what not, are turned in His mighty
hand as surely and as certainly as it turns the stars, and continually
fall into new patterns and combinations. But the composing elements
remain the same, nor will there be one more bit of coloured glass nor
one less for ever and ever.
</p><p>This being so, supposing for the sake of argument we divide ourselves
into twenty parts, nineteen savage and one civilized, we must look
to the nineteen savage portions of our nature, if we would really
understand ourselves, and not to the twentieth, which, though so
insignificant in reality, is spread all over the other nineteen, making
them appear quite different from what they really are, as the blacking
does a boot, or the veneer a table. It is on the nineteen rough
serviceable savage portions that we fall back on emergencies, not on the
polished but unsubstantial twentieth. Civilization should wipe away our
tears, and yet we weep and cannot be comforted. Warfare is abhorrent
to her, and yet we strike out for hearth and home, for honour and fair
fame, and can glory in the blow. And so on, through everything.
</p><p>So, when the heart is stricken, and the head is humbled in the dust,
civilization fails us utterly. Back, back, we creep, and lay us like
little children on the great breast of Nature, she that perchance may
soothe us and make us forget, or at least rid remembrance of its sting.
Who has not in his great grief felt a longing to look upon the outward
features of the universal Mother; to lie on the mountains and watch the
clouds drive across the sky and hear the rollers break in thunder on the
shore, to let his poor struggling life mingle for a while in her life;
to feel the slow beat of her eternal heart, and to forget his woes, and
let his identity be swallowed in the vast imperceptibly moving energy of
her of whom we are, from whom we came, and with whom we shall again be
mingled, who gave us birth, and will in a day to come give us our burial
also.
</p><p>And so in my trouble, as I walked up and down the oak-panelled vestibule
of my house there in Yorkshire, I longed once more to throw myself into
the arms of Nature. Not the Nature which you know, the Nature that waves
in well-kept woods and smiles out in corn-fields, but Nature as she was
in the age when creation was complete, undefiled as yet by any human
sinks of sweltering humanity. I would go again where the wild game was,
back to the land whereof none know the history, back to the savages,
whom I love, although some of them are almost as merciless as Political
Economy. There, perhaps, I should be able to learn to think of poor
Harry lying in the churchyard, without feeling as though my heart would
break in two.
</p><p>And now there is an end of this egotistical talk, and there shall be
no more of it. But if you whose eyes may perchance one day fall upon my
written thoughts have got so far as this, I ask you to persevere, since
what I have to tell you is not without its interest, and it has never
been told before, nor will again.
