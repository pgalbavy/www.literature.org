<P>

As lakes and river-systems are separated
from each other by barriers of land, it might have been thought that
fresh-water productions would not have ranged widely within the same
country, and as the sea is apparently a still more impassable barrier,
that they never would have extended to distant countries. But the case
is exactly the reverse. Not only have many fresh-water species,
belonging to quite different classes, an enormous range, but allied
species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout the world. I well
remember, when first collecting in the fresh waters of Brazil, feeling
much surprise at the similarity of the fresh-water insects, shells,
&amp;c., and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding terrestrial
beings, compared with those of Britain.
<P>
But this power in fresh-water productions of ranging widely, though
so unexpected, can, I think, in most cases be explained by their
having become fitted, in a manner highly useful to them, for short and
frequent migrations from pond to pond, or from stream to stream; and
liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an
almost necessary consequence. We can here consider only a few cases.
In regard to fish, I believe that the same species never occur in the
fresh waters of distant continents. But on the same continent the
species often range widely and almost capriciously; for two
river-systems will have some fish in common and some different. A few
facts seem to favour the possibility of their occasional transport by
accidental means; like that of the live fish not rarely
dropped by whirlwinds in India, and the vitality of their ova when
removed from the water.  But I am inclined to attribute the dispersal
of fresh-water fish mainly to slight changes within the recent period
in the level of the land, having caused rivers to flow into each
other. Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred during
floods, without any change of level. We have evidence in the loess of
the Rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a very
recent geological period, and when the surface was peopled by existing
land and fresh-water shells. The wide difference of the fish on
opposite sides of continuous mountain-ranges, which from an early
period must have parted river-systems and completely prevented their
inosculation, seems to lead to this same conclusion. With respect to
allied fresh-water fish occurring at very distant points of the world,
no doubt there are many cases which cannot at present be explained:
but some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such
cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes,
and consequently time and means for much migration. In the second
place, salt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in
fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single
group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water, so that we may
imagine that a marine member of a fresh-water group might travel far
along the shores of the sea, and subsequently become modified and
adapted to the fresh waters of a distant land.
<P>
Some species of fresh-water shells have a very wide range, and
allied species, which, on my theory, are descended from a common
parent and must have proceeded from a single source, prevail
throughout the world. Their distribution at first perplexed me much,
as their ova are not likely to be transported by birds, and they are
immediately killed by sea water, as are the adults. I could not even
understand how some naturalised species have rapidly spread throughout
the same country. But two facts, which I have observed   and no
doubt many others remain to be observed   throw some light on
this subject. When a duck suddenly emerges from a pond covered with
duck-weed, I have twice seen these little plants adhering to its back;
and it has happened to me, in removing a little duck-weed
from one aquarium to another, that I have quite unintentionally
stocked the one with fresh-water shells from the other. But another
agency is perhaps more effectual: I suspended a duck's feet, which
might represent those of a bird sleeping in a natural pond, in an
aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching; and I
found that numbers of the extremely minute and just hatched shells
crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out
of the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more
advanced age they would voluntarily drop off. These just hatched
molluscs, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck's feet,
in damp air, from twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time a
duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and would
be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet, if blown across sea to an
oceanic island or to any other distant point. Sir Charles Lyell also
informs me that a Dyticus has been caught with an Ancylus (a
fresh-water shell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a
water-beetle of the same family, a Colymbetes, once flew on board the
`Beagle,' when forty-five miles distant
from the nearest land: how much farther it might have flown with a
favouring gale no one can tell.
<P>
With respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges
many fresh-water and even marsh-species have, both over continents and
to the most remote oceanic islands. This is strikingly shown, as
remarked by Alph. de Candolle, in large groups of terrestrial plants,
which have only a very few aquatic members; for these latter seem
immediately to acquire, as if in consequence, a very wide range.  I
think favourable means of dispersal explain this fact. I have before
mentioned that earth occasionally, though rarely, adheres in some
quantity to the feet and beaks of birds. Wading birds, which frequent
the muddy edges of ponds, if suddenly flushed, would be the most
likely to have muddy feet. Birds of this order I can show are the
greatest wanderers, and are occasionally found on the most remote and
barren islands in the open ocean; they would not be likely to alight
on the surface of the sea, so that the dirt would not be washed off
their feet; when making land, they would be sure to fly
to their natural fresh-water haunts. I do not believe that botanists
are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with seeds: I have tried
several little experiments, but will here give only the most striking
case: I took in February three table-spoonfuls of mud from three
different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little pond; this
mud when dry weighed only 6 3/4 ounces; I kept it covered up in my
study for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it grew;
the plants were of many kinds, and were altogether 537 in number; and
yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup! Considering
these facts, I think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if
water-birds did not transport the seeds of fresh-water plants to vast
distances, and if consequently the range of these plants was not very
great. The same agency may have come into play with the eggs of some
of the smaller fresh-water animals.
<P>
Other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. I have
stated that fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they
reject many other kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish
swallow seeds of moderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and
Potamogeton. Herons and other birds, century after century, have gone
on daily devouring fish; they then take flight and go to other waters,
or are blown across the sea; and we have seen that seeds retain their
power of germination, when rejected in pellets or in excrement, many
hours afterwards. When I saw the great size of the seeds of that fine
water-lily, the Nelumbium, and remembered Alph. de Candolle's remarks
on this plant, I thought that its distribution must remain quite
inexplicable; but Audubon states that he found the seeds of the great
southern water-lily (probably, according to Dr Hooker, the Nelumbium
luteum) in a heron's stomach; although I do not know the fact, yet
analogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and
getting a hearty meal of fish, would probably reject from its stomach
a pellet containing the seeds of the Nelumbium undigested; or the
seeds might be dropped by the bird whilst feeding its young, in the
same way as fish are known sometimes to be dropped.
<P>
In considering these several means of distribution, it should be
remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for
instance, on a rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a
single seed or egg will have a good chance of succeeding. Although
there will always be a struggle for life between the individuals of
the species, however few, already occupying any pond, yet as the
number of kinds is small, compared with those on the land, the
competition will probably be less severe between aquatic than between
terrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a
foreign country, would have a better chance of seizing on a place,
than in the case of terrestrial colonists. We should, also, remember
that some, perhaps many, fresh-water productions are low in the scale
of nature, and that we have reason to believe that such low beings
change or become modified less quickly than the high; and this will
give longer time than the average for the migration of the same
aquatic species. We should not forget the probability of many species
having formerly ranged as continuously as fresh-water productions ever
can range, over immense areas, and having subsequently become extinct
in intermediate regions. But the wide distribution of fresh-water
plants and of the lower animals, whether retaining the same identical
form or in some degree modified, I believe mainly depends on the wide
dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals, more especially by
fresh-water birds, which have large powers of flight, and naturally
travel from one to another and often distant piece of water. Nature,
like a careful gardener, thus takes her seeds from a bed of a
particular nature, and drops them in another equally well fitted for
them.
<P>
<H4>On the Inhabitants of Oceanic Islands</H4>
<P>
We now come to the last of the three classes of facts, which I have
selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty, on the view
that all the individuals both of the same and of allied species have
descended from a single parent; and therefore have all proceeded from
a common birthplace, notwithstanding that in the course of time they
have come to inhabit distant points of the globe. I have already
stated that I cannot honestly admit Forbes's view on continental
extensions, which, if legitimately followed out, would lead to the
belief that within the recent period all existing islands have been
nearly or quite joined to some continent.  This view
would remove many difficulties, but it would not, I think, explain all
the facts in regard to insular productions. In the following remarks I
shall not confine myself to the mere question of dispersal; but shall
consider some other facts, which bear on the truth of the two theories
of independent creation and of descent with modification.
<P>
The species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in
number compared with those on equal continental areas: Alph. de
Candolle admits this for plants, and Wollaston for insects. If we look
to the large size and varied stations of New Zealand, extending over
780 miles of latitude, and compare its flowering plants, only 750 in
number, with those on an equal area at the Cape of Good Hope or in
Australia, we must, I think, admit that something quite independently
of any difference in physical conditions has caused so great a
difference in number. Even the uniform county of Cambridge has 847
plants, and the little island of Anglesea 764, but a few ferns and a
few introduced plants are included in these numbers, and the
comparison in some other respects is not quite fair. We have evidence
that the barren island of Ascension aboriginally possessed under
half-a-dozen flowering plants; yet many have become naturalised on it,
as they have on New Zealand and on every other oceanic island which
can be named. In St. Helena there is reason to believe that the
naturalised plants and animals have nearly or quite exterminated many
native productions.  He who admits the doctrine of the creation of
each separate species, will have to admit, that a sufficient number of
the best adapted plants and animals have not been created on oceanic
islands; for man has unintentionally stocked them from various sources
far more fully and perfectly than has nature.
<P>
Although in oceanic islands the number of kinds of inhabitants is
scanty, the proportion of endemic species (<I>i.e.
</I> those found nowhere else in the world) is often extremely
large. If we compare, for instance, the number of the endemic
land-shells in Madeira, or of the endemic birds in the Galapagos
Archipelago, with the number found on any continent, and then compare
the area of the islands with that of the continent, we shall see that
this is true. This fact might have been expected on my
theory for, as already explained, species occasionally arriving after
long intervals in a new and isolated district, and having to compete
with new associates, will be eminently liable to modification, and
will often produce groups of modified descendants. But it by no means
follows, that, because in an island nearly all the species of one
class are peculiar, those of another class, or of another section of
the same class, are peculiar; and this difference seems to depend on
the species which do not become modified having immigrated with
facility and in a body, so that their mutual relations have not been
much disturbed. Thus in the Galapagos Islands nearly every land-bird,
but only two out of the eleven marine birds, are peculiar; and it is
obvious that marine birds could arrive at these islands more easily
than land-birds. Bermuda, on the other hand, which lies at about the
same distance from North America as the Galapagos Islands do from
South America, and which has a very peculiar soil, does not possess
one endemic land bird; and we know from Mr. J. M. Jones's admirable
account of Bermuda, that very many North American birds, during their
great annual migrations, visit either periodically or occasionally
this island.  Madeira does not possess one peculiar bird, and many
European and African birds are almost every year blown there, as I am
informed by Mr. E. V. Harcourt. So that these two islands of Bermuda
and Madeira have been stocked by birds, which for long ages have
struggled together in their former homes, and have become mutually
adapted to each other; and when settled in their new homes, each kind
will have been kept by the others to their proper places and habits,
and will consequently have been little liable to modification.
Madeira, again, is inhabited by a wonderful number of peculiar
land-shells, whereas not one species of sea-shell is confined to its
shores: now, though we do not know how seashells are dispersed, yet we
can see that their eggs or larvae, perhaps attached to seaweed or
floating timber, or to the feet of wading-birds, might be transported
far more easily than land-shells, across three or four hundred miles of
open sea. The different orders of insects in Madeira apparently
present analogous facts.
<P>
Oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in certain classes, and
their places are apparently occupied by the other
inhabitants; in the Galapagos Islands reptiles, and in New Zealand
gigantic wingless birds, take the place of mammals. In the plants of
the Galapagos Islands, Dr. Hooker has shown that the proportional
numbers of the different orders are very different from what they are
elsewhere. Such cases are generally accounted for by the physical
conditions of the islands; but this explanation seems to me not a
little doubtful. Facility of immigration, I believe, has been at least
as important as the nature of the conditions.
<P>
Many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the
inhabitants of remote islands. For instance, in certain islands not
tenanted by mammals, some of the endemic plants have beautifully
hooked seeds; yet few relations are more striking than the adaptation
of hooked seeds for transportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds.
This case presents no difficulty on my view, for a hooked seed might
be transported to an island by some other means; and the plant then
becoming slightly modified, but still retaining its hooked seeds,
would form an endemic species, having as useless an appendage as any
rudimentary organ,   for instance, as the shrivelled wings under
the soldered elytra of many insular beetles. Again, islands often
possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include
only herbaceous species; now trees, as Alph. de Candolle has shown,
generally have, whatever the cause may be, confined ranges. Hence
trees would be little likely to reach distant oceanic islands; and an
herbaceous plant, though it would have no chance of successfully
competing in stature with a fully developed tree, when established on
an island and having to compete with herbaceous plants alone, might
readily gain an advantage by growing taller and taller and overtopping
the other plants. If so, natural selection would often tend to add to
the stature of herbaceous plants when growing on an island, to
whatever order they belonged, and thus convert them first into bushes
and ultimately into trees.
<P>
With respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands,
Bory St. Vincent long ago remarked that Batrachians (frogs, toads,
newts) have never been found on any of the many islands with which the
great oceans are studded. I have taken pains to verify this assertion,
and I have found it strictly true. I have, however, been
assured that a frog exists on the mountains of the great island of New
Zealand; but I suspect that this exception (if the information be
correct) may be explained through glacial agency. This general absence
of frogs, toads, and newts on so many oceanic islands cannot be
accounted for by their physical conditions; indeed it seems that
islands are peculiarly well fitted for these animals; for frogs have
been introduced into Madeira, the Azores, and Mauritius, and have
multiplied so as to become a nuisance.  But as these animals and their
spawn are known to be immediately killed by sea-water, on my view we
can see that there would be great difficulty in their transportal
across the sea, and therefore why they do not exist on any oceanic
island. But why, on the theory of creation, they should not have been
created there, it would be very difficult to explain.
<P>
Mammals offer another and similar case. I have carefully searched
the oldest voyages, but have not finished my search; as yet I have not
found a single instance, free from doubt, of a terrestrial mammal
(excluding domesticated animals kept by the natives) inhabiting an
island situated above 300 miles from a continent or great continental
island; and many islands situated at a much less distance are equally
barren. The Falkland Islands, which are inhabited by a wolf-like fox,
come nearest to an exception; but this group cannot be considered as
oceanic, as it lies on a bank connected with the mainland; moreover,
icebergs formerly brought boulders to its western shores, and they may
have formerly transported foxes, as so frequently now happens in the
arctic regions. Yet it cannot be said that small islands will not
support small mammals, for they occur in many parts of the world on
very small islands, if close to a continent; and hardly an island can
be named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised
and greatly multiplied. It cannot be said, on the ordinary view of
creation, that there has not been time for the creation of mammals;
many volcanic islands are sufficiently ancient, as shown by the
stupendous degradation which they have suffered and by their tertiary
strata: there has also been time for the production of endemic species
belonging to other classes; and on continents it is thought that
mammals appear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower
animals.  Though terrestrial mammals do not occur on
oceanic islands, a&euml;rial mammals do occur on almost every island. New
Zealand possesses two bats found nowhere else in the world: Norfolk
Island, the Viti Archipelago, the Bonin Islands, the Caroline and
Marianne Archipelagoes, and Mauritius, all possess their peculiar
bats. Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced
bats and no other mammals on remote islands? On my view this question
can easily be answered; for no terrestrial mammal can be transported
across a wide space of sea, but bats can fly across. Bats have been
seen wandering by day far over the Atlantic Ocean; and two North
American species either regularly or occasionally visit Bermuda, at
the distance of 600 miles from the mainland. I hear from Mr. Tomes, who
has specially studied this family, that many of the same species have
enormous ranges, and are found on continents and on far distant
islands. Hence we have only to suppose that such wandering species
have been modified through natural selection in their new homes in
relation to their new position, and we can understand the presence of
endemic bats on islands, with the absence of all terrestrial mammals.
<P>
Besides the absence of terrestrial mammals in relation to the
remoteness of islands from continents, there is also a relation, to a
certain extent independent of distance, between the depth of the sea
separating an island from the neighbouring mainland, and the presence
in both of the same mammiferous species or of allied species in a more
or less modified condition. Mr. Windsor Earl has made some striking
observations on this head in regard to the great Malay Archipelago,
which is traversed near Celebes by a space of deep ocean; and this
space separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas.  On either side
the islands are situated on moderately deep submarine banks, and they
are inhabited by closely allied or identical quadrupeds. No doubt some
few anomalies occur in this great archipelago, and there is much
difficulty in forming a judgment in some cases owing to the probable
naturalisation of certain mammals through man's agency; but we shall
soon have much light thrown on the natural history of this archipelago
by the admirable zeal and researches of Mr Wallace. I have not as yet
had time to follow up this subject in all other quarters
of the world; but as far as I have gone, the relation generally holds
good. We see Britain separated by a shallow channel from Europe, and
the mammals are the same on both sides; we meet with analogous facts
on many islands separated by similar channels from Australia. The West
Indian Islands stand on a deeply submerged bank, nearly 1000 fathoms
in depth, and here we find American forms, but the species and even
the genera are distinct. As the amount of modification in all cases
depends to a certain degree on the lapse of time, and as during
changes of level it is obvious that islands separated by shallow
channels are more likely to have been continuously united within a
recent period to the mainland than islands separated by deeper
channels, we can understand the frequent relation between the depth of
the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian inhabitants of
islands with those of a neighbouring continent,   an explicable
relation on the view of independent acts of creation.
<P>
All the foregoing remarks on the inhabitants of oceanic islands,
  namely, the scarcity of kinds -- the richness in endemic
forms in particular classes or sections of classes,   the
absence of whole groups, as of batrachians, and of terrestrial mammals
notwithstanding the presence of a&euml;rial bats,   the
singular proportions of certain orders of plants,   herbaceous
forms having been developed into trees, &amp;c.,   seem to me to
accord better with the view of occasional means of transport having
been largely efficient in the long course of time, than with the view
of all our oceanic islands having been formerly connected by
continuous land with the nearest continent; for on this latter view
the migration would probably have been more complete; and if
modification be admitted, all the forms of life would have been more
equally modified, in accordance with the paramount importance of the
relation of organism to organism.
<P>
I do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties in
understanding how several of the inhabitants of the more remote
islands, whether still retaining the same specific form or modified
since their arrival, could have reached their present homes. But the
probability of many islands having existed as halting-places, of which
not a wreck now remains, must not be overlooked. I will
here give a single instance of one of the cases of difficulty.  Almost
all oceanic islands, even the most isolated and smallest, are
inhabited by land-shells, generally by endemic species, but sometimes
by species found elsewhere. Dr. Aug. A. Gould has given several
interesting cases in regard to the land-shells of the islands of the
Pacific. Now it is notorious that land-shells are very easily killed
by salt; their eggs, at least such as I have tried, sink in sea-water
and are killed by it. Yet there must be, on my view, some unknown, but
highly efficient means for their transportal.  Would the just-hatched
young occasionally crawl on and adhere to the feet of birds roosting
on the ground, and thus get transported? It occurred to me that
land-shells, when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over
the mouth of the shell, might be floated in chinks of drifted timber
across moderately wide arms of the sea. And I found that several
species did in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in
sea-water during seven days: one of these shells was the Helix
pomatia, and after it had again hybernated I put it in sea-water for
twenty days, and it perfectly recovered. As this species has a thick
calcareous operculum, I removed it, and when it had formed a new
membranous one, I immersed it for fourteen days in sea-water, and it
recovered and crawled away: but more experiments are wanted on this
head.
<P>
The most striking and important fact for us in regard to the
inhabitants of islands, is their affinity to those of the nearest
mainland, without being actually the same species. Numerous instances
could be given of this fact. I will give only one, that of the
Galapagos Archipelago, situated under the equator, between 500 and 600
miles from the shores of South America. Here almost every product of
the land and water bears the unmistakeable stamp of the American
continent. There are twenty-six land birds, and twenty-five of those
are ranked by Mr Gould as distinct species, supposed to have been
created here; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to
American species in every character, in their habits, gestures, and
tones of voice, was manifest. So it is with the other animals, and
with nearly all the plants, as shown by Dr. Hooker in his admirable
memoir on the Flora of this archipelago. The naturalist, looking at
the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the Pacific,
distant several hundred miles from the continent, yet feels that he is
standing on American land. Why should this be so?  why should the
species which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos
Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plain a stamp of affinity to
those created in America?  There is nothing in the conditions of life,
in the geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate,
or in the proportions in which the several classes are associated
together, which resembles closely the conditions of the South American
coast: in fact there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these
respects. On the other hand, there is a considerable degree of
resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil, in climate, height,
and size of the islands, between the Galapagos and Cape de Verde
Archipelagos: but what an entire and absolute difference in their
inhabitants! The inhabitants of the Cape de Verde Islands are related
to those of Africa, like those of the Galapagos to America. I believe
this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary
view of independent creation; whereas on the view here maintained, it
is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would be likely to receive
colonists, whether by occasional means of transport or by formerly
continuous land, from America; and the Cape de Verde Islands from
Africa; and that such colonists would be liable to modifications;
  the principle of inheritance still betraying their original
birthplace.
<P>
Many analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost
universal rule that the endemic productions of islands are related to
those of the nearest continent, or of other near islands. The
exceptions are few, and most of them can be explained. Thus the plants
of Kerguelen Land, though standing nearer to Africa than to America,
are related, and that very closely, as we know from Dr. Hooker's
account, to those of America: but on the view that this island has
been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and stones on
icebergs, drifted by the prevailing currents, this anomaly disappears.
New Zealand in its endemic plants is much more closely related to
Australia, the nearest mainland, than to any other region: and this is
what might have been expected; but it is also plainly related to South
America, which, although the next nearest continent, is
so enormously remote, that the fact becomes an anomaly. But this
difficulty almost disappears on the view that both New Zealand, South
America, and other southern lands were long ago partially stocked from
a nearly intermediate though distant point, namely from the antarctic
islands, when they were clothed with vegetation, before the
commencement of the Glacial period.  The affinity, which, though
feeble, I am assured by Dr. Hooker is real, between the flora of the
south-western corner of Australia and of the Cape of Good Hope, is a
far more remarkable case, and is at present inexplicable: but this
affinity is confined to the plants, and will, I do not doubt, be some
day explained.
<P>
The law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago, though
specifically distinct, to be closely allied to those of the nearest
continent, we sometimes see displayed on a small scale, yet in a most
interesting manner, within the limits of the same archipelago. Thus
the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago are tenanted, as I
have elsewhere shown, in a quite marvellous manner, by very closely
related species; so that the inhabitants of each separate island,
though mostly distinct, are related in an incomparably closer degree
to each other than to the inhabitants of any other part of the world.
And this is just what might have been expected on my view, for the
islands are situated so near each other that they would almost
certainly receive immigrants from the same original source, or from
each other. But this dissimilarity between the endemic inhabitants of
the islands may be used as an argument against my views; for it may be
asked, how has it happened in the several islands situated within
sight of each other, having the same geological nature, the same
height, climate, &amp;c., that many of the immigrants should have been
differently modified, though only in a small degree. This long
appeared to me a great difficulty: but it arises in chief part from
the deeply-seated error of considering the physical conditions of a
country as the most important for its inhabitants; whereas it cannot,
I think, be disputed that the nature of the other inhabitants, with
which each has to compete, is at least as important, and generally a
far more important element of success. Now if we look to those
inhabitants of the Galapagos Archipelago which are found
in other parts of the world (having on one side for the moment the
endemic species, which cannot be here fairly included, as we are
considering how they have come to be modified since their arrival), we
find a considerable amount of difference in the several islands. This
difference might indeed have been expected on the view of the islands
having been stocked by occasional means of transport   a seed,
for instance, of one plant having been brought to one island, and that
of another plant to another island. Hence when in former times an
immigrant settled on any one or more of the islands, or when it
subsequently spread from one island to another, it would undoubtedly
be exposed to different conditions of life in the different islands,
for it would have to compete with different sets of organisms: a
plant, for instance, would find the best-fitted ground more perfectly
occupied by distinct plants in one island than in another, and it
would be exposed to the attacks of somewhat different enemies. If then
it varied, natural selection would probably favour different varieties
in the different islands. Some species, however, might spread and yet
retain the same character throughout the group, just as we see on
continents some species' spreading widely and remaining the same.
<P>
The really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos
Archipelago, and in a lesser degree in some analogous instances, is
that the new species formed in the separate islands have not quickly
spread to the other islands. But the islands, though in sight of each
other, are separated by deep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than
the British Channel, and there is no reason to suppose that they have
at any former period been continuously united. The currents of the sea
are rapid and sweep across the archipelago, and gales of wind are
extraordinarily rare; so that the islands are far more effectually
separated from each other than they appear to be on a map.
Nevertheless a good many species, both those found in other parts of
the world and those confined to the archipelago, are common to the
several islands, and we may infer from certain facts that these have
probably spread from some one island to the others. But we often take,
I think, an erroneous view of the probability of closely allied
species invading each other's territory, when put into free
intercommunication. Undoubtedly if one species has any advantage
whatever over another, it will in a very brief time wholly or in part
supplant it; but if both are equally well fitted for their own places
in nature, both probably will hold their own places and keep separate
for almost any length of time. Being familiar with the fact that many
species, naturalised through man's agency, have spread with
astonishing rapidity over new countries, we are apt to infer that most
species would thus spread; but we should remember that the forms which
become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied
to the aboriginal inhabitants, but are very distinct species,
belonging in a large proportion of cases, as shown by Alph. de
Candolle, to distinct genera. In the Galapagos Archipelago, many even
of the birds, though so well adapted for flying from island to island,
are distinct on each; thus there are three closely-allied species of
mocking-thrush, each confined to its own island. Now let us suppose
the mocking-thrush of Chatham Island to be blown to Charles Island,
which has its own mocking-thrush: why should it succeed in
establishing itself there? We may safely infer that Charles Island is
well stocked with its own species, for annually more eggs are laid
there than can possibly be reared; and we may infer that the
mocking-thrush peculiar to Charles Island is at least as well fitted
for its home as is the species peculiar to Chatham Island. Sir C.
Lyell and Mr. Wollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact
bearing on this subject; namely, that Madeira and the adjoining islet
of Porto Santo possess many distinct but representative land-shells,
some of which live in crevices of stone; and although large quantities
of stone are annually transported from Porto Santo to Madeira, yet
this latter island has not become colonised by the Porto Santo
species: nevertheless both islands have been colonised by some
European land-shells, which no doubt had some advantage over the
indigenous species. From these considerations I think we need not
greatly marvel at the endemic and representative species, which
inhabit the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago, not having
universally spread from island to island. In many other instances, as
in the several districts of the same continent,
pre-occupation has probably played an important part in checking the
commingling of species under the same conditions of life. Thus, the
south-east and south-west corners of Australia have nearly the same
physical conditions, and are united by continuous land, yet they are
inhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals, birds, and plants.
<P>
The principle which determines the general character of the fauna
and flora of oceanic islands, namely, that the inhabitants, when not
identically the same, yet are plainly related to the inhabitants of
that region whence colonists could most readily have been derived,
  the colonists having been subsequently modified and better
fitted to their new homes,   is of the widest application
throughout nature. We see this on every mountain, in every lake and
marsh. For Alpine species, excepting in so far as the same forms,
chiefly of plants, have spread widely throughout the world during the
recent Glacial epoch, are related to those of the surrounding
lowlands;   thus we have in South America, Alpine humming-birds,
Alpine rodents, Alpine plants, &amp;c., all of strictly American
forms, and it is obvious that a mountain, as it became slowly
upheaved, would naturally be colonised from the surrounding lowlands.
So it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes, excepting in so
far as great facility of transport has given the same general forms to
the whole world. We see this same principle in the blind animals
inhabiting the caves of America and of Europe. Other analogous facts
could be given. And it will, I believe, be universally found to be
true, that wherever in two regions, let them be ever so distant, many
closely allied or representative species occur, there will likewise be
found some identical species, showing, in accordance with the
foregoing view, that at some former period there has been
intercommunication or migration between the two regions.  And wherever
many closely-allied species occur, there will be found many forms
which some naturalists rank as distinct species, and some as
varieties; these doubtful forms showing us the steps in
the process of modification.
<P>
This relation between the power and extent of migration of a
species, either at the present time or at some former period under
different physical conditions, and the existence at remote
points of the world of other species allied to it, is shown
in another and more general way. Mr. Gould remarked to me long ago,
that in those genera of birds which range over the world, many of the
species have very wide ranges. I can hardly doubt that this rule is
generally true, though it would be difficult to prove it. Amongst
mammals, we see it strikingly displayed in Bats, and in a lesser
degree in the Felidae and Canidae. We see it, if we compare the
distribution of butterflies and beetles. So it is with most
fresh-water productions, in which so many genera range over the world,
and many individual species have enormous ranges. It is not meant that
in world-ranging genera all the species have a wide range, or even
that they have on an average a wide range; but only that some of the
species range very widely; for the facility with which widely-ranging
species vary and give rise to new forms will largely determine their
average range. For instance, two varieties of the same species inhabit
America and Europe, and the species thus has an immense range; but, if
the variation had been a little greater, the two varieties would have
been ranked as distinct species, and the common range would have been
greatly reduced. Still less is it meant, that a species which
apparently has the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely,
as in the case of certain powerfully-winged birds, will necessarily
range widely; for we should never forget that to range widely implies
not only the power of crossing barriers, but the more important power
of being victorious in distant lands in the struggle for life with
foreign associates. But on the view of all the species of a genus
having descended from a single parent, though now distributed to the
most remote points of the world, we ought to find, and I believe as a
general rule we do find, that some at least of the species range very
widely; for it is necessary that the unmodified parent should range
widely, undergoing modification during its diffusion, and should place
itself under diverse conditions favourable for the conversion of its
offspring, firstly into new varieties and ultimately into new species.
<P>
In considering the wide distribution of certain genera, we should
bear in mind that some are extremely ancient, and must have branched
off from a common parent at a remote epoch; so that in
such cases there will have been ample time for great climatal and
geographical changes and for accidents of transport; and consequently
for the migration of some of the species into all quarters of the
world, where they may have become slightly modified in relation to
their new conditions. There is, also, some reason to believe from
geological evidence that organisms low in the scale within each great
class, generally change at a slower rate than the higher forms; and
consequently the lower forms will have had a better chance of ranging
widely and of still retaining the same specific character. This fact,
together with the seeds and eggs of many low forms being very minute
and better fitted for distant transportation, probably accounts for a
law which has long been observed, and which has lately been admirably
discussed by Alph. de Candolle in regard to plants, namely, that the
lower any group of organisms is, the more widely it is apt to range.
<P>
The relations just discussed,   namely, low and
slowly-changing organisms ranging more widely than the high,  
some of the species of widely-ranging genera themselves ranging
widely,   such facts, as alpine, lacustrine, and marsh
productions being related (with the exceptions before specified) to
those on the surrounding low lands and dry lands, though these
stations are so different   the very close relation of the
distinct species which inhabit the islets of the same archipelago,
  and especially the striking relation of the inhabitants of
each whole archipelago or island to those of the nearest mainland,
  are, I think, utterly inexplicable on the ordinary view of the
independent creation of each species, but are explicable on the view
of colonisation from the nearest and readiest source, together with
the subsequent modification and better adaptation of the colonists to
their new homes.
</P>
<H4>Summary of last and present Chapters</H4>
<P>
In these chapters I have endeavoured to show, that if we make due
allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of all the changes of
climate and of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred
within the recent period, and of other similar changes which may have
occurred within the same period; if we remember how
profoundly ignorant we are with respect to the many and curious means
of occasional transport,   a subject which has hardly ever been
properly experimentised on; if we bear in mind how often a species may
have ranged continuously over a wide area, and then have become
extinct in the intermediate tracts, I think the difficulties in
believing that all the individuals of the same species, wherever
located, have descended from the same parents, are not insuperable.
And we are led to this conclusion, which has been arrived at by many
naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation, by
some general considerations, more especially from the importance of
barriers and from the analogical distribution of sub-genera, genera,
and families.
<P>
With respect to the distinct species of the same genus, which on my
theory must have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same
allowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that some forms
of life change most slowly, enormous periods of time being thus
granted for their migration, I do not think that the difficulties are
insuperable; though they often are in this case, and in that of the
individuals of the same species, extremely grave.
<P>
As exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution, I
have attempted to show how important has been the influence of the
modern Glacial period, which I am fully convinced simultaneously
affected the whole world, or at least great meridional belts. As
showing how diversified are the means of occasional transport, I have
discussed at some little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water
productions.
<P>
If the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the
long course of time the individuals of the same species, and likewise
of allied species, have proceeded from some one source; then I think
all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are
explicable on the theory of migration (generally of the more dominant
forms of life), together with subsequent modification and the
multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high
importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our
several zoological and botanical provinces.  We can thus understand
the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; and how it is
that under different latitudes, for instance in South
America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests,
marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by
affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly
inhabited the same continent. Bearing in mind that the mutual
relations of organism to organism are of the highest importance, we
can see why two areas having nearly the same physical conditions
should often be inhabited by very different forms of life; for
according to the length of time which has elapsed since new
inhabitants entered one region; according to the nature of the
communication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter,
either in greater or lesser numbers; according or not, as those which
entered happened to come in more or less direct competition with each
other and with the aborigines; and according as the immigrants were
capable of varying more or less rapidly, there would ensue in
different regions, independently of their physical conditions,
infinitely diversified conditions of life,   there would be an
almost endless amount of organic action and reaction,   and we
should find, as we do find, some groups of beings greatly, and some
only slightly modified,   some developed in great force, some
existing in scanty numbers   in the different great geographical
provinces of the world.
<P>
On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured
to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these
a great number should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in relation to
the means of migration, one group of beings, even within the same
class, should have all its species endemic, and another group should
have all its species common to other quarters of the world. We can see
why whole groups of organisms, as batrachians and terrestrial mammals,
should be absent from oceanic islands, whilst the most isolated
islands possess their own peculiar species of a&euml;rial mammals or bats.
We can see why there should be some relation between the presence of
mammals, in a more or less modified condition, and the depth of the
sea between an island and the mainland. We can clearly see why all the
inhabitants of an archipelago, though specifically distinct on the
several islets, should be closely related to each other, and likewise
be related, but less closely, to those of the nearest
continent or other source whence immigrants were probably derived. We
can see why in two areas, however distant from each other, there
should be a correlation, in the presence of identical species, of
varieties, of doubtful species, and of distinct but representative
species.
<P>
As the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking
parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space: the laws
governing the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same
with those governing at the present time the differences in different
areas. We see this in many facts. The endurance of each species and
group of species is continuous in time; for the exceptions to the rule
are so few, that they may fairly be attributed to our not having as
yet discovered in an intermediate deposit the forms which are therein
absent, but which occur above and below: so in space, it certainly is
the general rule that the area inhabited by a single species, or by a
group of species, is continuous; and the exceptions, which are not
rare, may, as I have attempted to show, be accounted for by migration
at some former period under different conditions or by occasional
means of transport, and by the species having become extinct in the
intermediate tracts. Both in time and space, species and groups of
species have their points of maximum development. Groups of species,
belonging either to a certain period of time, or to a certain area,
are often characterised by trifling characters in common, as of
sculpture or colour. In looking to the long succession of ages, as in
now looking to distant provinces throughout the world, we find that
some organisms differ little, whilst others belonging to a different
class, or to a different order, or even only to a different family of
the same order, differ greatly. In both time and space the lower
members of each class generally change less than the higher; but there
are in both cases marked exceptions to the rule. On my theory these
several relations throughout time and space are intelligible; for
whether we look to the forms of life which have changed during
successive ages within the same quarter of the world, or to those
which have changed after having migrated into distant quarters, in
both cases the forms within each class have been connected by the same
bond of ordinary generation; and the more nearly any two forms are
related in blood, the nearer they will generally stand to
each other in time and space; in both cases the laws of variation have
been the same, and modifications have been accumulated by the same
power of natural selection.
