<p>(<em>EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE, </em>continued)</p>

<p>"I am again at the window-sill," continues Rouletabille, "and
once more I raise my head above it. Through an opening in the
curtains, the arrangement of which has not been changed, I am
ready to look, anxious to note the position in which I am going
to find the murderer,&mdash;whether his back will still be turned towards
me!&mdash;whether he is still seated at the desk writing! But perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;he
is no longer there! &mdash;Yet how could he have fled? &mdash;Was
I not in possession of his ladder? I force myself to be cool.
I raise my head yet higher. I look&mdash;he is still there. I see his
monstrous back, deformed by the shadow thrown by the candle. He
is no longer writing now, and the candle is on the parquet, over
which he is bending&mdash;a position which serves my purpose.</p>

<p>"I hold my breath. I mount the ladder. I am on the uppermost
rung of it, and with my left hand seize hold of the window-sill.
In this moment of approaching success, I feel my heart beating
wildly. I put my revolver between my teeth. A quick spring, and
I shall be on the window-ledge. But&mdash;the ladder! I had been obliged
to press on it heavily, and my foot had scarcely left it, when
I felt it swaying beneath me. It grated on the wall and fell.
But, already, my knees were touching the window-sill, and, by
a movement quick as lightning, I got on to it.</p>

<p>"But the murderer had been even quicker than I had been. He had
heard the grating of the ladder on the wall, and I saw the monstrous
back of the man raise itself. I saw his head. Did I really see
it? &mdash;The candle on the parquet lit up his legs only. Above
the height of the table the chamber was in darkness. I saw a man
with long hair, a full beard, wild-looking eyes, a pale face,
framed in large whiskers,&mdash;as well as I could distinguish, and,
as I think&mdash;red in colour. I did not know the face. That was,
in brief, the chief sensation I received from that face in the
dim half-light in which I saw it. I did not know it&mdash;or, at least,
I did not recognise it.</p>

<p>"Now for quick action! It was indeed time for that, for as I
was about to place my legs through the window, the man had seen
me, had bounded to his feet, had sprung&mdash;as I foresaw he would&mdash;to
the door of the ante-chamber, had time to open it, and fled. But
I was already behind him, revolver in hand, shouting ‘Help!’</p>

<p>"Like an arrow I crossed the room, but noticed a letter on the
table as I rushed. I almost came up with the man in the ante-room,
for he had lost time in opening the door to the gallery. I flew
on wings, and in the gallery was but a few feet behind him. He
had taken, as I supposed he would, the gallery on his right,&mdash;that
is to say, the road he had prepared for his flight. ‘Help, Jacques!&mdash;help,
Larsan!’ I cried. He could not escape us! I raised a shout of
joy, of savage victory. The man reached the intersection of the
two galleries hardly two seconds before me for the meeting which
I had prepared&mdash;the fatal shock which must inevitably take place
at that spot! We all rushed to the crossing-place &mdash;Monsieur
Stangerson and I coming from one end of the right gallery, Daddy
Jacques coming from the other end of the same gallery, and Frederic
Larsan coming from the ‘off-turning’ gallery.</p>

<p>"The man was not there!</p>

<p>"We looked at each other stupidly and with eyes terrified. The
man had vanished like a ghost. ‘Where is he&mdash;where is he?’ we
all asked.</p>

<p>"‘It is impossible he can have escaped!’ I cried, my terror mastered
by my anger.</p>

<p>"‘I touched him!’ exclaimed Frederic Larsan.</p>

<p>"‘I felt his breath on my face!’ cried Daddy Jacques.</p>

<p>"‘Where is he?’&mdash;where is he?’ we all cried.</p>

<p>"We raced like madmen along the two galleries; we visited doors
and windows&mdash;they were closed, hermetically closed. They had not
been opened. Besides, the opening of a door or window by this
man whom we were hunting, without our having perceived it, would
have been more inexplicable than his disappearance.</p>

<p>"Where is he?&mdash;where is he? &mdash;He could not have got away
by a door or a window, nor by any other way. He could not have
passed through our bodies!</p>

<p>"I confess that, for the moment, I felt ‘done for.’ For the gallery
was perfectly lighted, and there was neither trap, nor secret
door in the walls, nor any sort of hiding-place. We moved the
chairs and lifted the pictures. Nothing!&mdash;nothing! We would have
looked into a flower-pot, if there had been one to look into!"</p>

<p>When this mystery, thanks to Rouletabille, was naturally explained,
by the help alone of his masterful mind, we were able to realise
that the murderer had got away neither by a door, a window, nor
the stairs&mdash;a fact which the judges would not admit.</p>
