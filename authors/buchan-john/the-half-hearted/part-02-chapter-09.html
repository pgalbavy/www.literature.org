<p>Lewis got to his feet and blinked at the morning sun across the
yard.</p>

<p>"That was a near shave. Phew, I hate being a target for sharpshooting!
These devils are your friends the Bada-Mawidi."</p>

<p>"The deuce they are," said Andover lugubriously. "I always knew
it. I've told Holm a hundred times, and now here is the beggar
away sick and I am left to pay the piper."</p>

<p>"I know. I met him in Bardur, and that's why I'm here. He told
me to tell you to mind the north gate."</p>

<p>"More easily said than done. We're too few by half here if things
get nasty. How was the chap looking?"</p>

<p>"Pretty miserable. Thwaite and I put him to bed. Then they sent
me off here, for I've got news for you. You know a man called
Marker?"</p>

<p>Andover nodded.</p>

<p>"I was dining with him the day before yesterday, and yesterday
morning I got a note from him. He says that he has heard from
some private source that the Bada-Mawidi were arming and proposed
an attack on Forza to-day. He thinks they may have got their arms
from the other side, you know. At any rate he asked me to try
to let you hear, and when I saw Holm last night and heard that
such a thing was possible, I came off at once. I suppose Marker
is the sort of man who should know."</p>

<p>"What did Thwaite say?"</p>

<p>"He was keen that I should come at once. Do you think that it's
a false alarm?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it will be genuine enough on Marker's part, but he may have
been misinformed. What beats me is the attack by day. I know the
Badas as I know my own name, and they're too few at the best to
have any chance of rushing the place. Besides, they are poor fighters
in the open. On the other hand they are devils incarnate in a
night attack, as we used to find to our cost. You are sure he
said to-day?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Some time this morning."</p>

<p>"Wonder what their game is. However, he ought to be right if
anybody is, and we are much obliged to you for your trouble. You
had a pretty hard time in the open, but how on earth did you get
up the hill?"</p>

<p>"Deerstalking style. It was good sport. But for heaven's sake,
Andy, give me breakfast, and tell me what you want me to do. I
am under your orders now."</p>

<p>"You'd better feed and then sleep for a bit. If you don't mind
I'll leave you, for I've got to be very busy. And poor old Holm
looked pretty sick, did he? Well, I am glad he has been saved
this affair anyhow."</p>

<p>A Sikh orderly brought Lewis breakfast. Beyond the tent door
there was stir in the garrison. Men were deployed in the yard,
Gurkhas mainly, with a few Kashmir sepoys, and the loud harsh
voice of Andover was raised to give orders. It was a hot still
morning, with something thunderous in the air. Hot sulphurous
clouds were massing on the western horizon, and the cool early
breeze had gone. The whole place smelt of powder.</p>

<p>Half-way through the meal Andover returned, his lean face red
with exertion. "I've got things more or less in order. They may
easily starve us out, for we are wretchedly provisioned, but I
don't think they'll get us with a rush. I wonder when the show
is to commence." He drank some coffee, and then filled a pipe.</p>

<p>"I left a man at Nazri. If the thing turns out to be a small
affair I am to meet him there to-night; but if I don't come he
is to know that it is serious and go and warn the Khautmi people.
You haven't a connection by any chance?"</p>

<p>"No. Wish we had. The heliograph is no good, and the telegraph
is still under the consideration of some engineer man. But how
do you propose to get to Nazri? It's only twelve miles, but they
are mostly up on end."</p>

<p>"I did it when I was here before. It's easy enough if you have
done any rock-climbing, and I can leave with the light. Besides,
there's a moon."</p>

<p>Andover laughed. "You've turned over a new leaf, Lewis. Your
energy puts us all to shame. I wish I had your physical gifts,
my son. The worst of being long and lanky in a place like this
is that you're always as stiff as a poker. I shall die of sciatica
before I am forty. But upon my word it is queer meeting you here
in the loneliest spot in creation. When I saw you in town before
I came out, you were going into Parliament or some game of that
kind. Then I heard that you had been out here, and gone back;
and now for no earthly reason I waken up one fine morning to find
you being potted at before my gate. You're as sudden as Marker,
and a long chalk more mysterious."</p>

<p>Lewis looked grave. "I wish Marker were only as simple as me,
or I as sudden as him. It's a gift not learned in a day. Anyhow
I'm here, and we've got a day's sport before us. Hullo, the ball
seems about to open." Little puffs of smoke and dust were rising
from beyond the wall, and on the heavy air came the faint ping-ping
of rifles.</p>

<p>Andover stretched himself elaborately. "Lord alive, but this
is absurd. What do these beggars expect to do? They can't shell
a fort with stolen expresses."</p>

<p>The two men went up to the edge of the wall and looked over the
plateau. A hundred yards off stood a group of tribesmen formed
in some semblance of military order, each with a smoking rifle
in his hand. It was like a parody of a formation, and Andover
after rubbing his eyes burst into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>"The beggars must be mad. What in heaven's name do they expect
to do, standing there like mummies and potting at a stone wall?
There's two more companies of them over there. It isn't war, it's
comic opera." And he sat down, still laughing, on the edge of
a gun-case to put on the boots which his orderly had brought.</p>

<p>It was comic opera, but the tinge of melodrama was not absent.
When a sufficient number of rounds had been fired, the tribesmen,
as if acting on half-understood instructions from some prehistoric
manual, slung their rifles on their shoulders and came on. The
fire from the fort did not stop them, though it broke their line.
In a minute they were clutching at every hand-grip and foothold
on the wall, and Andover with a beaming face directed the disposition
of his men.</p>

<p>Forza is built of great, rough stones, with ends projecting in
places cyclopean-wise, which to an active man might give a foothold.
The little garrison was at its posts, and picked the men off with
carbines and revolvers, and in emergencies gave a brown chest
the straight bayonet-thrust home. The tribesmen fought like fiends,
scrambling up silently with long knives between their teeth, till
a shot found them and they rolled back to die on the sand at the
foot. Now and again a man would reach the parapet and spring down
into the courtyard. Then it was the turn of Andover and Lewis
to account for him, and they did not miss. One man with matted
hair and beard was at Lewis's back before he saw him. A crooked
knife had nearly found that young man's neck, but a lucky twisting
aside saved him. He dodged his adversary up and down the yard
till he got his pistol from his inner pocket. Then it was his
turn to face about. The man never stopped and a ball took him
between the eyes. He dropped dead as a stone, and his knife flying
from his hand skidded along the sand till it stopped with a clatter
on the stones. The sound in the hot sulphurous air grated horribly,
and Lewis clapped his hands to his ears to find that he too had
not come off scathless. The knife had cut the lobe, and, bleeding
like a pig, he went in search of water.</p>

<p>The assailants seemed prepared to find paradise speedily, for
they were not sparing with their lives. The attacking party was
small, and apparently there was no reserve, for in all the wide
landscape there was no sign of man. Then for no earthly reason
the assault was at an end. One by one the men dropped back and
disappeared from the plateau. There was no overt signal, no sound;
but in a little the annoyed garrison were looking at vacancy and
one another.</p>

<p>"This is the devil's own business," said Andover, rubbing his
eyes. The men, too astonished to pick off stragglers, allowed
the enemy to melt into space; then they set themselves down with
rifles cuddled up to their chins, and stared at Andover.</p>

<p>"It beats me," said that disturbed man. "How many killed?"</p>

<p>"Seven," said a sergeant. "About five more wounded. None of us
touched, barring a bullet in my boot, and two Johnnies slashed
on the cheek. Seems to me as if the gen'lman, Mr. 'Aystoun, was
'it, though."</p>

<p>At the word Andover ran for his quarters, where he found his
servant dressing Lewis's wounded ear. That young man with a face
of great despair was inclining his head over a basin.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Andy? Don't tell me the show has stopped.
I thought they were game to go on for hours, and I was just coming
to join you."</p>

<p>"They've gone, every mother's son of them. I told you it was
comic opera all along. Seven of them have found the part too much
for them, but the rest have cleared out like smoke. I give it
up."</p>

<p>Lewis stared at the speaker, his brain busy with a problem. For
a moment before the fight, and for a little during its progress
he had been serenely happy. He had done something hard and perilous;
he had risked bullets; he had brought authentic news of a real
danger. He was happily at peace with himself; the bland quiet
of conscience which he had not felt for months had given him the
vision of a new life. But the danger had faded away in smoke;
and here was Andover with a mystified face asking its meaning.</p>

<p>"I swear that those fellows never had the least intention of
beating us. There were far too few of them for one thing. They
looked like criminals fighting under sentence, you know, like
the Persian fellows. It was more like some religious ceremony
than a fight. The whole thing is beyond me, but I think no harm's
done. Hang it, I wish Holm were here. He's a depressing beggar,
but he takes responsibility off my shoulders."</p>

<p>The dead men were buried as quickly and decently as the place
allowed of. Things were generally cleaned up, and by noon the
little fort was as spick as if the sound of a rifle had never
been heard within its walls. Lewis and Andover had the midday
meal in a sort of gun-room which looked over the edge of the plateau
to a valley in the hills. It had been arranged and furnished by
a former commandant who found in the view a repetition of the
one in a much-loved Highland shooting-box. Accordingly it was
comfortable and homelike beyond the average of frontier dwellings.
Outside a dripping mist had clouded the hills and chilled the
hot air.</p>

<p>The two men smoked silently, knocking out their ashes and refilling
with the regularity of clockwork. Lewis was thinking hard, thinking
of the bitterness of dashed hopes, of self-confidence clutched
at and lost. He saw as if in an inspiration the trend of Marker's
plans. He had been given a paltry fictitious errand, like a bone
to a dog, to quiet him. Some devilry was afoot and he must be
got out of the road. For a second the thought pleased him, the
thought that at least one man held him worthy of attention, and
went out of his way to circumvent him. But the gleam of satisfaction
was gone in a moment. He could not even be sure that there was
guile at the back of it. It might be all foolish honesty, and
to a man cursed with a sense of weakness the thought of such a
pedestrian failure was trebly intolerable.</p>

<p>But honesty was inconceivable. He and he alone in all the frontier
country knew Marker and his ways. To Andover, sucking his pipe
dismally beside him, the thing appeared clear as the daylight.
Marker, the best man alive, had word of some Bada-Mawidi doings
and had given a friendly hint. It was not his blame if the thing
had fizzled out like damp powder. But to Lewis, Marker was a man
of uncanny powers and intelligence beyond others, the iron will
of the true adventurer. There must be devilry behind it all, and
to the eye of suspicion there was doubt in every detail. And meantime
he had fallen an easy victim. Marooned in this frontier fort,
the world might be turned topsy-turvy at Bardur, and he not a
word the wiser. Things were slipping from his grasp again. He
had an intense desire to shut his eyes and let all drift. He had
done enough. He had come up here at the risk of his neck; fate
had fought against him, and he must succumb. The fatal wisdom
of proverbs was all on his side.</p>

<p>But once again conscience assailed him. Why had he believed Marker,
knowing what he knew? He had been led by the nose like a crude
school-boy. It was nothing to him that he had to believe or remain
idle in Bardur. Another proof of his folly! This importunate sense
of weakness was the weakest of all qualities. It made him a nervous
and awkward follower of strength, only to plunge deeper into the
mud of incapacity.</p>

<p>Andover looked at him curiously. His annoyance was of a different
stamp&mdash;a little disappointment, intense boredom, and the ever-present
frontier anxiety. But such were homely complaints to be forgotten
over a pipe and in sleep. It struck him that his companion's eyes
betrayed something more, and he kicked him on the shins into attention.</p>

<p>"Been seedy lately? Have some quinine. Or if you can't sleep
I can tell you a dodge. But you know you are looking a bit cheap,
old man."</p>

<p>"I'm pretty fit," said Lewis, and he raised his brown face to
a glass. "Why I'm tanned like a nigger and my eye's perfectly
clear."</p>

<p>"Then you're in love," said the mysterious Andover. "Trust me
for knowing. When a man keeps as quiet as you for so long, he's
either in love or seedy. Up here people don't fall in love, so
I thought it must be the other thing."</p>

<p>"Rot," said Lewis. "I'm going out of doors. I must be off pretty
soon, if I'm to get to Nazri by sundown. I wish you'd come out
and show me the sort of lie of the land. There are three landmarks,
but I can't remember their order."</p>

<p>An hour later the two men returned, and Lewis sat down to an
early dinner. He ate quickly, and made up sandwiches which he
stuffed into his pocket. Then he rose and gripped his host's hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Andy. This has been a pleasant meeting. Wish it could
have been longer."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, old chap. Glad to have seen you. My love to George,
if you get to Nazri. Give you three to one in half-crowns you
won't get there to-night."</p>

<p>"Done," said Lewis. "You shall pay when I see you next." And
in the most approved style of the hero of melodrama he lit a short
pipe and went off into Immensity.</p>
