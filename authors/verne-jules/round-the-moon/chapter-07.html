Thus a phenomenon, curious but explicable, was happening under
these strange conditions.
<P>
Every object thrown from the projectile would follow the same
course and never stop until it did.  There was a subject for
conversation which the whole evening could not exhaust.
<P>
Besides, the excitement of the three travelers increased as they
drew near the end of their journey.  They expected unforseen
incidents, and new phenomena; and nothing would have astonished
them in the frame of mind they then were in.  Their overexcited
imagination went faster than the projectile, whose speed was
evidently diminishing, though insensibly to themselves.  But the
moon grew larger to their eyes, and they fancied if they
stretched out their hands they could seize it.
<P>
The next day, the 5th of November, at five in the morning,
all three were on foot.  That day was to be the last of their
journey, if all calculations were true.  That very night, at
twelve o'clock, in eighteen hours, exactly at the full moon,
they would reach its brilliant disc.  The next midnight would
see that journey ended, the most extraordinary of ancient or
modern times.  Thus from the first of the morning, through the
scuttles silvered by its rays, they saluted the orb of night
with a confident and joyous hurrah.
<P>
The moon was advancing majestically along the starry firmament.
A few more degrees, and she would reach the exact point where
her meeting with the projectile was to take place.
<P>
According to his own observations, Barbicane reckoned that they
would land on her northern hemisphere, where stretch immense plains,
and where mountains are rare.  A favorable circumstance if, as
they thought, the lunar atmosphere was stored only in its depths.
<P>
"Besides," observed Michel Ardan, "a plain is easier to
disembark upon than a mountain.  A Selenite, deposited in Europe
on the summit of Mont Blanc, or in  Asia on the top of the
Himalayas, would not be quite in the right place."
<P>
"And," added Captain Nicholl, "on a flat ground, the projectile
will remain motionless when it has once touched; whereas on a
declivity it would roll like an avalanche, and not being
squirrels we should not come out safe and sound.  So it is all
for the best."
<P>
Indeed, the success of the audacious attempt no longer
appeared doubtful.  But Barbicane was preoccupied with one
thought; but not wishing to make his companions uneasy, he
kept silence on this subject.
<P>
The direction the projectile was taking toward the moon's
northern hemisphere, showed that her course had been
slightly altered.  The discharge, mathematically calculated,
would carry the projectile to the very center of the lunar disc.
If it did not land there, there must have been some deviation.
What had caused it?  Barbicane could neither imagine nor
determine the importance of the deviation, for there were no
points to go by.
<P>
He hoped, however, that it would have no other result than that
of bringing them nearer the upper border of the moon, a region
more suitable for landing.
<P>
Without imparting his uneasiness to his companions, Barbicane
contented himself with constantly observing the moon, in order
to see whether the course of the projectile would not be
altered; for the situation would have been terrible if it failed
in its aim, and being carried beyond the disc should be launched
into interplanetary space.  At that moment, the moon, instead of
appearing flat like a disc, showed its convexity.  If the sun's
rays had struck it obliquely, the shadow thrown would have brought
out the high mountains, which would have been clearly detached.
The eye might have gazed into the crater's gaping abysses,
and followed the capricious fissures which wound through the
immense plains.  But all relief was as yet leveled in
intense brilliancy.  They could scarcely distinguish those
large spots which give the moon the appearance of a human face.
<P>
"Face, indeed!" said Michel Ardan; "but I am sorry for the
amiable sister of Apollo.  A very pitted face!"
<P>
But the travelers, now so near the end, were incessantly
observing this new world.  They imagined themselves walking
through its unknown countries, climbing its highest peaks,
descending into its lowest depths.  Here and there they fancied
they saw vast seas, scarcely kept together under so rarefied an
atmosphere, and water-courses emptying the mountain tributaries.
Leaning over the abyss, they hoped to catch some sounds from
that orb forever mute in the solitude of space.  That last day
left them.
<P>
They took down the most trifling details.  A vague uneasiness
took possession of them as they neared the end.  This uneasiness
would have been doubled had they felt how their speed had decreased.
It would have seemed to them quite insufficient to carry them to
the end.  It was because the projectile then "weighed" almost nothing.
Its weight was ever decreasing, and would be entirely annihilated on
that line where the lunar and terrestrial attractions would
neutralize each other.
<P>
But in spite of his preoccupation, Michel Ardan did not forget
to prepare the morning repast with his accustomed punctuality.
They ate with a good appetite.  Nothing was so excellent as the
soup liquefied by the heat of the gas; nothing better than the
preserved meat.  Some glasses of good French wine crowned the
repast, causing Michel Ardan to remark that the lunar vines,
warmed by that ardent sun, ought to distill even more generous
wines; that is, if they existed.  In any case, the far-seeing
Frenchman had taken care not to forget in his collection some
precious cuttings of the Medoc and Cote d'Or, upon which he
founded his hopes.
<P>
Reiset and Regnaut's apparatus worked with great regularity.
Not an atom of carbonic acid resisted the potash; and as to
the oxygen, Captain Nicholl said "it was of the first quality."
The little watery vapor enclosed in the projectile mixing with
the air tempered the dryness; and many apartments in London,
Paris, or New York, and many theaters, were certainly not in
such a healthy condition.
<P>
But that it might act with regularity, the apparatus must be
kept in perfect order; so each morning Michel visited the escape
regulators, tried the taps, and regulated the heat of the gas by
the pyrometer.  Everything had gone well up to that time, and
the travelers, imitating the worthy Joseph T. Maston, began to
acquire a degree of embonpoint which would have rendered them
unrecognizable if their imprisonment had been prolonged to
some months.  In a word, they behaved like chickens in a coop;
they were getting fat.
<P>
In looking through the scuttle Barbicane saw the specter of the
dog, and other divers objects which had been thrown from the
projectile, obstinately following them.  Diana howled
lugubriously on seeing the remains of Satellite, which seemed as
motionless as if they reposed on solid earth.
<P>
"Do you know, my friends," said Michel Ardan, "that if one of us
had succumbed to the shock consequent on departure, we should
have had a great deal of trouble to bury him?  What am I saying?
to _etherize_ him, as here ether takes the place of earth.
You see the accusing body would have followed us into space like
a remorse."
<P>
"That would have been sad," said Nicholl.
<P>
"Ah!" continued Michel, "what I regret is not being able to take a
walk outside.  What voluptuousness to float amid this radiant ether,
to bathe oneself in it, to wrap oneself in the sun's pure rays.
If Barbicane had only thought of furnishing us with a diving
apparatus and an air-pump, I could have ventured out and assumed
fanciful attitudes of feigned monsters on the top of the projectile."
<P>
"Well, old Michel," replied Barbicane, "you would not have made
a feigned monster long, for in spite of your diver's dress, swollen
by the expansion of air within you, you would have burst like a
shell, or rather like a balloon which has risen too high.  So do
not regret it, and do not forget this-- as long as we float in
space, all sentimental walks beyond the projectile are forbidden."
<P>
Michel Ardan allowed himself to be convinced to a certain extent.
He admitted that the thing was difficult but not impossible,
a word which he never uttered.
<P>
The conversation passed from this subject to another, not failing
him for an instant.  It seemed to the three friends as though,
under present conditions, ideas shot up in their brains as leaves
shoot at the first warmth of spring.  They felt bewildered.  In the
middle of the questions and answers which crossed each other,
Nicholl put one question which did not find an immediate solution.
<P>
"Ah, indeed!" said he; "it is all very well to go to the moon,
but how to get back again?"
<P>
His two interlocutors looked surprised.  One would have thought
that this possibility now occurred to them for the first time.
<P>
"What do you mean by that, Nicholl?" asked Barbicane gravely.
<P>
"To ask for means to leave a country," added Michel, "When we
have not yet arrived there, seems to me rather inopportune."
<P>
"I do not say that, wishing to draw back," replied Nicholl;
"but I repeat my question, and I ask, `How shall we return?'"
<P>
"I know nothing about it," answered Barbicane.
<P>
"And I," said Michel, "if I had known how to return, I would
never have started."
<P>
"There's an answer!" cried Nicholl.
<P>
"I quite approve of Michel's words," said Barbicane; "and add,
that the question has no real interest.  Later, when we think it
is advisable to return, we will take counsel together.  If the
Columbiad is not there, the projectile will be."
<P>
"That is a step certainly.  A ball without a gun!"
<P>
"The gun," replied Barbicane, "can be manufactured.  The powder
can be made.  Neither metals, saltpeter, nor coal can fail in
the depths of the moon, and we need only go 8,000 leagues in
order to fall upon the terrestrial globe by virtue of the mere
laws of weight."
<P>
"Enough," said Michel with animation.  "Let it be no longer a
question of returning: we have already entertained it too long.
As to communicating with our former earthly colleagues, that
will not be difficult."
<P>
"And how?"
<P>
"By means of meteors launched by lunar volcanoes."
<P>
"Well thought of, Michel," said Barbicane in a convinced tone
of voice.  "Laplace has calculated that a force five times greater
than that of our gun would suffice to send a meteor from the
moon to the earth, and there is not one volcano which has not a
greater power of propulsion than that."
<P>
"Hurrah!" exclaimed Michel; "these meteors are handy postmen,
and cost nothing.  And how we shall be able to laugh at the
post-office administration!  But now I think of it----"
<P>
"What do you think of?"
<P>
"A capital idea.  Why did we not fasten a thread to our
projectile, and we could have exchanged telegrams with the earth?"
<P>
"The deuce!" answered Nicholl.  "Do you consider the weight of
a thread 250,000 miles long nothing?"
<P>
"As nothing.  They could have trebled the Columbiad's charge;
they could have quadrupled or quintupled it!" exclaimed Michel,
with whom the verb took a higher intonation each time.
<P>
"There is but one little objection to make to your proposition,"
replied Barbicane, "which is that, during the rotary motion of
the globe, our thread would have wound itself round it like a
chain on a capstan, and that it would inevitably have brought us
to the ground."
<P>
"By the thirty-nine stars of the Union!" said Michel, "I have
nothing but impracticable ideas to-day; ideas worthy of J.
T. Maston.  But I have a notion that, if we do not return to
earth, J. T. Maston will be able to come to us."
<P>
"Yes, he'll come," replied Barbicane; "he is a worthy and a
courageous comrade.  Besides, what is easier?  Is not the
Columbiad still buried in the soil of Florida?  Is cotton and
nitric acid wanted wherewith to manufacture the pyroxyle?
Will not the moon pass the zenith of Florida?  In eighteen
years' time will she not occupy exactly the same place as to-day?"
<P>
"Yes," continued Michel, "yes, Maston will come, and with him
our friends Elphinstone, Blomsberry, all the members of the Gun
Club, and they will be well received.  And by and by they will
run trains of projectiles between the earth and the moon!
Hurrah for J. T. Maston!"
<P>
It is probable that, if the Hon. J. T. Maston did not hear the
hurrahs uttered in his honor, his ears at least tingled.  What was
he doing then?  Doubtless, posted in the Rocky Mountains, at the
station of Long's Peak, he was trying to find the invisible
projectile gravitating in space.  If he was thinking of his dear
companions, we must allow that they were not far behind him; and
that, under the influence of a strange excitement, they were
devoting to him their best thoughts.
<P>
But whence this excitement, which was evidently growing upon the
tenants of the projectile?  Their sobriety could not be doubted.
This strange irritation of the brain, must it be attributed to
the peculiar circumstances under which they found themselves, to
their proximity to the orb of night, from which only a few hours
separated them, to some secret influence of the moon acting upon
their nervous system?  Their faces were as rosy as if they had
been exposed to the roaring flames of an oven; their voices
resounded in loud accents; their words escaped like a champagne
cork driven out by carbonic acid; their gestures became annoying,
they wanted so much room to perform them; and, strange to say,
they none of them noticed this great tension of the mind.
<P>
"Now," said Nicholl, in a short tone, "now that I do not know
whether we shall ever return from the moon, I want to know what
we are going to do there?"
<P>
"What we are going to do there?" replied Barbicane, stamping
with his foot as if he was in a fencing saloon; "I do not know."
<P>
"You do not know!" exclaimed Michel, with a bellow which
provoked a sonorous echo in the projectile.
<P>
"No, I have not even thought about it," retorted Barbicane, in
the same loud tone.
<P>
"Well, I know," replied Michel.
<P>
"Speak, then," cried Nicholl, who could no longer contain the
growling of his voice.
<P>
"I shall speak if it suits me," exclaimed Michel, seizing his
companions' arms with violence.
<P>
"_It must_ suit you," said Barbicane, with an eye on fire and a
threatening hand.  "It was you who drew us into this frightful
journey, and we want to know what for."
<P>
"Yes," said the captain, "now that I do not know _where_ I am
going, I want to know _why_ I am going."
<P>
"Why?" exclaimed Michel, jumping a yard high, "why?  To take
possession of the moon in the name of the United States; to add
a fortieth State to the Union; to colonize the lunar regions;
to cultivate them, to people them, to transport thither all the
prodigies of art, of science, and industry; to civilize the
Selenites, unless they are more civilized than we are; and to
constitute them a republic, if they are not already one!"
<P>
"And if there are no Selenites?" retorted Nicholl, who, under the
influence of this unaccountable intoxication, was very contradictory.
<P>
"Who said that there were no Selenites?" exclaimed Michel in a
threatening tone.
<P>
"I do," howled Nicholl.
<P>
"Captain," said Michel, "do not repreat that insolence, or I
will knock your teeth down your throat!"
<P>
The two adversaries were going to fall upon each other, and the
incoherent discussion threatened to merge into a fight, when
Barbicane intervened with one bound.
<P>
"Stop, miserable men," said he, separating his two companions;
"if there are no Selenites, we will do without them."
<P>
"Yes," exclaimed Michel, who was not particular; "yes, we will
do without them.  We have only to make Selenites.  Down with
the Selenites!"
<P>
"The empire of the moon belongs to us," said Nicholl.
<P>
"Let us three constitute the republic."
<P>
"I will be the congress," cried Michel.
<P>
"And I the senate," retorted Nicholl.
<P>
"And Barbicane, the president," howled Michel.
<P>
"Not a president elected by the nation," replied Barbicane.
<P>
"Very well, a president elected by the congress," cried Michel;
"and as I am the congress, you are unanimously elected!"
<P>
"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! for President Barbicane," exclaimed Nicholl.
<P>
"Hip! hip! hip!" vociferated Michel Ardan.
<P>
Then the president and the senate struck up in a tremendous
voice the popular song "Yankee Doodle," while from the congress
resounded the masculine tones of the "Marseillaise."
<P>
Then they struck up a frantic dance, with maniacal gestures,
idiotic stampings, and somersaults like those of the boneless
clowns in the circus.  Diana, joining in the dance, and howling
in her turn, jumped to the top of the projectile.  An unaccountable
flapping of wings was then heard amid most fantastic cock-crows,
while five or six hens fluttered like bats against the walls.
<P>
Then the three traveling companions, acted upon by some
unaccountable influence above that of intoxication, inflamed by
the air which had set their respiratory apparatus on fire, fell
motionless to the bottom of the projectile.
<P>
