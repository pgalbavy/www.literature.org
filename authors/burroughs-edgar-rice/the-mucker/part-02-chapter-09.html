<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>THE manager of El Orobo Rancho was an American named Grayson. He was a
tall, wiry man whose education had been acquired principally in the cow
camps of Texas, where, among other things one does NOT learn to love
nor trust a greaser. As a result of this early training Grayson was
peculiarly unfitted in some respects to manage an American ranch in
Mexico; but he was a just man, and so if his vaqueros did not love
him, they at least respected him, and everyone who was or possessed the
latent characteristics of a wrongdoer feared him.
</p>
<p>Perhaps it is not fair to say that Grayson was in any way unfitted for
the position he held, since as a matter of fact he was an ideal ranch
foreman, and, if the truth be known, the simple fact that he was a
gringo would have been sufficient to have won him the hatred of the
Mexicans who worked under him--not in the course of their everyday
relations; but when the fires of racial animosity were fanned to flame
by some untoward incident upon either side of the border.
</p><p>Today Grayson was particularly rabid. The more so because he could not
vent his anger upon the cause of it, who was no less a person than his
boss.
</p><p>It seemed incredible to Grayson that any man of intelligence could have
conceived and then carried out the fool thing which the boss had just
done, which was to have come from the safety of New York City to the
hazards of warring Mexico, bringing--and this was the worst feature
of it--his daughter with him. And at such a time! Scarce a day passed
without its rumors or reports of new affronts and even atrocities
being perpetrated upon American residents of Mexico. Each day, too, the
gravity of these acts increased. From mere insult they had run of late
to assault and even to murder. Nor was the end in sight.
</p><p>Pesita had openly sworn to rid Mexico of the gringo--to kill on sight
every American who fell into his hands. And what could Grayson do in
case of a determined attack upon the rancho? It is true he had a hundred
men--laborers and vaqueros, but scarce a dozen of these were Americans,
and the rest would, almost without exception, follow the inclinations of
consanguinity in case of trouble.
</p><p>To add to Grayson's irritability he had just lost his bookkeeper, and
if there was one thing more than any other that Grayson hated it was pen
and ink. The youth had been a “lunger” from Iowa, a fairly nice little
chap, and entirely suited to his duties under any other circumstances
than those which prevailed in Mexico at that time. He was in mortal
terror of his life every moment that he was awake, and at last had given
in to the urge of cowardice and resigned. The day previous he had been
bundled into a buckboard and driven over to the Mexican Central
which, at that time, still was operating trains--occasionally--between
Chihuahua and Juarez.
</p><p>His mind filled with these unpleasant thoughts, Grayson sat at his desk
in the office of the ranch trying to unravel the riddle of a balance
sheet which would not balance. Mixed with the blue of the smoke from his
briar was the deeper azure of a spirited monologue in which Grayson was
engaged.
</p><p>A girl was passing the building at the moment. At her side walked a
gray-haired man--one of those men whom you just naturally fit into a
mental picture of a director's meeting somewhere along Wall Street.
</p><p>“Sich langwidge!” cried the girl, with a laugh, covering her ears with
her palms.
</p><p>The man at her side smiled.
</p><p>“I can't say that I blame him much, Barbara,” he replied. “It was a
very foolish thing for me to bring you down here at this time. I can't
understand what ever possessed me to do it.”
</p><p>“Don't blame yourself, dear,” remonstrated the girl, “when it was all my
fault. I begged and begged and begged until you had to consent, and I'm
not sorry either--if nothing happens to you because of our coming. I
couldn't stay in New York another minute. Everyone was so snoopy, and
I could just tell that they were dying to ask questions about Billy and
me.”
</p><p>“I can't get it through my head yet, Barbara,” said the man, “why in the
world you broke with Billy Mallory. He's one of the finest young men in
New York City today--just my ideal of the sort of man I'd like my only
daughter to marry.”
</p><p>“I tried, Papa,” said the girl in a low voice; “but I couldn't--I just
couldn't.”
</p><p>“Was it because--” the man stopped abruptly. “Well, never mind dear,
I shan't be snoopy too. Here now, you run along and do some snooping
yourself about the ranch. I want to stop in and have a talk with
Grayson.”
</p><p>Down by one of the corrals where three men were busily engaged in
attempting to persuade an unbroken pony that a spade bit is a pleasant
thing to wear in one's mouth, Barbara found a seat upon a wagon box
which commanded an excellent view of the entertainment going on within
the corral. As she sat there experiencing a combination of admiration
for the agility and courage of the men and pity for the horse the tones
of a pleasant masculine voice broke in upon her thoughts.
</p><p>   “Out there somewhere!” says I to me.  “By Gosh, I guess, thats poetry!”
  “Out there somewhere--Penelope--with kisses on her mouth!”
    And then, thinks I, “O college guy! your talk it gets me in the eye,
  The north is creeping in the air, the birds are flying south.”
</p><p>Barbara swung around to view the poet. She saw a slender man astride a
fagged Mexican pony. A ragged coat and ragged trousers covered the
man's nakedness. Indian moccasins protected his feet, while a torn and
shapeless felt hat sat upon his well-shaped head. AMERICAN was written
all over him. No one could have imagined him anything else. Apparently
he was a tramp as well--his apparel proclaimed him that; but there
were two discordant notes in the otherwise harmonious ensemble of your
typical bo. He was clean shaven and he rode a pony. He rode erect, too,
with the easy seat of an army officer.
</p><p>At sight of the girl he raised his battered hat and swept it low to his
pony's shoulder as he bent in a profound bow.
</p><p>“I seek the majordomo, senorita,” he said.
</p><p>“Mr. Grayson is up at the office, that little building to the left of
the ranchhouse,” replied the girl, pointing.
</p><p>The newcomer had addressed her in Spanish, and as he heard her reply,
in pure and liquid English, his eyes widened a trifle; but the familiar
smile with which he had greeted her left his face, and his parting bow
was much more dignified though no less profound than its predecessor.
</p><p>  And you, my sweet Penelope, out there somewhere you wait for me,
  With buds of roses in your hair and kisses on your mouth.
</p>
<p>Grayson and his employer both looked up as the words of Knibbs' poem
floated in to them through the open window.
</p><p>“I wonder where that blew in from,” remarked Grayson, as his eyes
discovered Bridge astride the tired pony, looking at him through the
window. A polite smile touched the stranger's lips as his eyes met
Grayson's, and then wandered past him to the imposing figure of the
Easterner.
</p><p>“Good evening, gentlemen,” said Bridge.
</p><p>“Evenin',” snapped Grayson. “Go over to the cookhouse and the Chink'll
give you something to eat. Turn your pony in the lower pasture. Smith'll
show you where to bunk tonight, an' you kin hev your breakfast in the
mornin'. S'long!” The ranch superintendent turned back to the paper in
his hand which he had been discussing with his employer at the moment of
the interruption. He had volleyed his instructions at Bridge as though
pouring a rain of lead from a machine gun, and now that he had said what
he had to say the incident was closed in so far as he was concerned.
</p><p>The hospitality of the Southwest permitted no stranger to be turned away
without food and a night's lodging. Grayson having arranged for these
felt that he had done all that might be expected of a host, especially
when the uninvited guest was so obviously a hobo and doubtless a horse
thief as well, for who ever knew a hobo to own a horse?
</p><p>Bridge continued to sit where he had reined in his pony. He was looking
at Grayson with what the discerning boss judged to be politely concealed
enjoyment.
</p><p>“Possibly,” suggested the boss in a whisper to his aide, “the man has
business with you. You did not ask him, and I am sure that he said
nothing about wishing a meal or a place to sleep.”
</p><p>“Huh?” grunted Grayson, and then to Bridge, “Well, what the devil DO you
want?”
</p><p>“A job,” replied Bridge, “or, to be more explicit, I need a job--far be
it from me to WISH one.”
</p><p>The Easterner smiled. Grayson looked a bit mystified--and irritated.
</p><p>“Well, I hain't got none,” he snapped. “We don't need nobody now unless
it might be a good puncher--one who can rope and ride.”
</p><p>“I can ride,” replied Bridge, “as is evidenced by the fact that you now
see me astride a horse.”
</p><p>“I said RIDE,” said Grayson. “Any fool can SIT on a horse. NO, I hain't
got nothin', an' I'm busy now. Hold on!” he exclaimed as though seized
by a sudden inspiration. He looked sharply at Bridge for a moment and
then shook his head sadly. “No, I'm afraid you couldn't do it--a guy's
got to be eddicated for the job I got in mind.”
</p><p>“Washing dishes?” suggested Bridge.
</p><p>Grayson ignored the playfulness of the other's question.
</p><p>“Keepin' books,” he explained. There was a finality in his tone which
said: “As you, of course, cannot keep books the interview is now over.
Get out!”
</p><p>“I could try,” said Bridge. “I can read and write, you know. Let me
try.” Bridge wanted money for the trip to Rio, and, too, he wanted to
stay in the country until Billy was ready to leave.
</p><p>“Savvy Spanish?” asked Grayson.
</p><p>“I read and write it better than I speak it,” said Bridge, “though I do
the latter well enough to get along anywhere that it is spoken.”
</p><p>Grayson wanted a bookkeeper worse than he could ever recall having
wanted anything before in all his life. His better judgment told him
that it was the height of idiocy to employ a ragged bum as a bookkeeper;
but the bum was at least as much of a hope to him as is a straw to a
drowning man, and so Grayson clutched at him.
</p><p>“Go an' turn your cayuse in an' then come back here,” he directed, “an'
I'll give you a tryout.”
</p><p>“Thanks,” said Bridge, and rode off in the direction of the pasture
gate.
</p><p>“'Fraid he won't never do,” said Grayson, ruefully, after Bridge had
passed out of earshot.
</p><p>“I rather imagine that he will,” said the boss. “He is an educated man,
Grayson--you can tell that from his English, which is excellent. He's
probably one of the great army of down-and-outers. The world is full
of them--poor devils. Give him a chance, Grayson, and anyway he adds
another American to our force, and each one counts.”
</p><p>“Yes, that's right; but I hope you won't need 'em before you an' Miss
Barbara go,” said Grayson.
</p><p>“I hope not, Grayson; but one can never tell with conditions here such
as they are. Have you any hope that you will be able to obtain a safe
conduct for us from General Villa?”
</p><p>“Oh, Villa'll give us the paper all right,” said Grayson; “but it won't
do us no good unless we don't meet nobody but Villa's men on the way
out. This here Pesita's the critter I'm leery of. He's got it in for all
Americans, and especially for El Orobo Rancho. You know we beat off a
raid of his about six months ago--killed half a dozen of his men, an' he
won't never forgive that. Villa can't spare a big enough force to give
us safe escort to the border and he can't assure the safety of the train
service. It looks mighty bad, sir--I don't see what in hell you came
for.”
</p><p>“Neither do I, Grayson,” agreed the boss; “but I'm here and we've got
to make the best of it. All this may blow over--it has before--and we'll
laugh at our fears in a few weeks.”
</p><p>“This thing that's happenin' now won't never blow over 'til the stars
and stripes blow over Chihuahua,” said Grayson with finality.
</p><p>A few moments later Bridge returned to the office, having unsaddled his
pony and turned it into the pasture.
</p><p>“What's your name?” asked Grayson, preparing to enter it in his time
book.
</p><p>“Bridge,” replied the new bookkeeper.
</p><p>“'Nitials,” snapped Grayson.
</p><p>Bridge hesitated. “Oh, put me down as L. Bridge,” he said.
</p><p>“Where from?” asked the ranch foreman.
</p><p>“El Orobo Rancho,” answered Bridge.
</p><p>Grayson shot a quick glance at the man. The answer confirmed his
suspicions that the stranger was probably a horse thief, which, in
Grayson's estimation, was the worst thing a man could be.
</p><p>“Where did you get that pony you come in on?” he demanded. “I ain't
sayin' nothin' of course, but I jest want to tell you that we ain't got
no use for horse thieves here.”
</p><p>The Easterner, who had been a listener, was shocked by the brutality of
Grayson's speech; but Bridge only laughed.
</p><p>“If you must know,” he said, “I never bought that horse, an' the man he
belonged to didn't give him to me. I just took him.”
</p><p>“You got your nerve,” growled Grayson. “I guess you better git out. We
don't want no horse thieves here.”
</p><p>“Wait,” interposed the boss. “This man doesn't act like a horse thief.
A horse thief, I should imagine, would scarcely admit his guilt. Let's
have his story before we judge him.”
</p><p>“All right,” said Grayson; “but he's just admitted he stole the horse.”
</p><p>Bridge turned to the boss. “Thanks,” he said; “but really I did steal
the horse.”
</p><p>Grayson made a gesture which said: “See, I told you so.”
</p><p>“It was like this,” went on Bridge. “The gentleman who owned the horse,
together with some of his friends, had been shooting at me and my
friends. When it was all over there was no one left to inform us who
were the legal heirs of the late owners of this and several other horses
which were left upon our hands, so I borrowed this one. The law would
say, doubtless, that I had stolen it; but I am perfectly willing to
return it to its rightful owners if someone will find them for me.”
</p><p>“You been in a scrap?” asked Grayson. “Who with?”
</p><p>“A party of Pesita's men,” replied Bridge.
</p><p>“When?”
</p><p>“Yesterday.”
</p><p>“You see they are working pretty close,” said Grayson, to his employer,
and then to Bridge: “Well, if you took that cayuse from one of Pesita's
bunch you can't call that stealin'. Your room's in there, back of the
office, an' you'll find some clothes there that the last man forgot to
take with him. You ken have 'em, an' from the looks o' yourn you need
'em.”
</p><p>“Thank you,” replied Bridge. “My clothes are a bit rusty. I shall have
to speak to James about them,” and he passed through into the little
bedroom off the office, and closed the door behind him.
</p><p>“James?” grunted Grayson. “Who the devil does he mean by James? I hain't
seen but one of 'em.”
</p><p>The boss was laughing quietly.
</p><p>“The man's a character,” he said. “He'll be worth all you pay him--if
you can appreciate him, which I doubt, Grayson.”
</p><p>“I ken appreciate him if he ken keep books,” replied Grayson. “That's
all I ask of him.”
</p><p>When Bridge emerged from the bedroom he was clothed in white duck
trousers, a soft shirt, and a pair of tennis shoes, and such a change
had they wrought in his appearance that neither Grayson nor his employer
would have known him had they not seen him come from the room into which
they had sent him to make the exchange of clothing.
</p><p>“Feel better?” asked the boss, smiling.
</p><p>“Clothes are but an incident with me,” replied Bridge. “I wear them
because it is easier to do so than it would be to dodge the weather and
the police. Whatever I may have upon my back affects in no way what
I have within my head. No, I cannot say that I feel any better, since
these clothes are not as comfortable as my old ones. However if it
pleases Mr. Grayson that I should wear a pink kimono while working for
him I shall gladly wear a pink kimono. What shall I do first, sir?” The
question was directed toward Grayson.
</p><p>“Sit down here an' see what you ken make of this bunch of trouble,”
 replied the foreman. “I'll talk with you again this evenin'.”
</p><p>As Grayson and his employer quitted the office and walked together
toward the corrals the latter's brow was corrugated by thought and his
facial expression that of one who labors to fasten upon a baffling and
illusive recollection.
</p><p>“It beats all, Grayson,” he said presently; “but I am sure that I have
known this new bookkeeper of yours before. The moment he came out of
that room dressed like a human being I knew that I had known him; but
for the life of me I can't place him. I should be willing to wager
considerable, however, that his name is not Bridge.”
</p><p>“S'pect you're right,” assented Grayson. “He's probably one o' them
eastern dude bank clerks what's gone wrong and come down here to hide.
Mighty fine place to hide jest now, too.
</p><p>“And say, speakin' of banks,” he went on, “what'll I do 'bout sendin'
over to Cuivaca fer the pay tomorrow. Next day's pay day. I don't like
to send this here bum, I can't trust a greaser no better, an' I can't
spare none of my white men thet I ken trust.”
</p><p>“Send him with a couple of the most trustworthy Mexicans you have,”
 suggested the boss.
</p><p>“There ain't no sich critter,” replied Grayson; “but I guess that's the
best I ken do. I'll send him along with Tony an' Benito--they hate
each other too much to frame up anything together, an' they both hate a
gringo. I reckon they'll hev a lovely trip.”
</p><p>“But they'll get back with the money, eh?” queried the boss.
</p><p>“If Pesita don't get 'em,” replied Grayson.
