<p>Ah, well, everything comes to an end, even the longest up-climb.
So, after much sweat and effort and crossness, Hepburn and Hannele
emerged on to the rounded bluff where the road wound out of that
hideous great valley cleft into upper regions.  So they emerged
more on the level, out of the trees as out of something horrible,
on to a naked, great bank of rock and grass.</p>

<p>'Thank the Lord!' said Hannele.</p>

<p>So they trudged on round the bluff, and then in front of them saw
what is always, always wonderful, one of those shallow, upper
valleys, naked, where the first waters are rocked.  A flat,
shallow, utterly desolate valley, wide as a wide bowl under the
sky, with rock slopes and grey stone-slides and precipices all
round, and the zig-zag of snow-stripes and ice-roots descending,
and then rivers, streams and rivers rushing from many points
downwards, down out of the ice-roots and the snow-dagger-points,
waters rushing in newly-liberated frenzy downwards, down in
waterfalls and cascades and threads, down into the wide, shallow
bed of the valley, strewn with rocks and stones innumerable, and
not a tree, not a visible bush.</p>

<p>Only, of course, two hotels or restaurant places.  But these no
more than low, sprawling, peasant-looking places lost among the
stones, with stones on their roofs so that they seemed just a part
of the valley bed.  There was the valley, dotted with rock and
rolled-down stone, and these two house-places, and woven with
innumerable new waters, and one hoarse stone-tracked river in the
desert, and the thin road-track winding along the desolate flat,
past first one house, then the other, over one stream, then
another, on to the far rock-face above which the glacier seemed to
loll like some awful great tongue put out.</p>

<p>'Ah, it is wonderful!' he said, as if to himself.</p>

<p>And she looked quickly at his face, saw the queer, blank, sphinx-
look with which he gazed out beyond himself.  His eyes were black
and set, and he seemed so motionless, as if he were eternal facing
these upper facts.</p>

<p>She thrilled with triumph.  She felt he was overcome.</p>

<p>'It IS wonderful,' she said.</p>

<p>'Wonderful.  And forever wonderful,' he said.</p>

<p>'Ah, in WINTER - ' she cried.</p>

<p>His face changed, and he looked at her.</p>

<p>'In winter you couldn't get up here,' he said.</p>

<p>They went on.  Up the slopes cattle were feeding: came that
isolated tong-tong-tong of cow-bells, dropping like the slow clink
of ice on the arrested air.  The sound always woke in him a
primeval, almost hopeless melancholy.  Always made him feel navr&eacute;.
He looked round.  There was no tree, no bush, only great grey rocks
and pale boulders scattered in place of trees and bushes.  But yes,
clinging on one side like a dark, close beard were the alpenrose
shrubs.</p>

<p>'In May,' he said, 'that side there must be all pink with
alpenroses.'</p>

<p>'I MUST come.  I MUST come!' she cried.</p>

<p>There were tourists dotted along the road: and two tiny low carts
drawn by silky, long-eared mules.  These carts went right down to
meet the motor-cars, and to bring up provisions for the Glacier
Hotel: for there was still another big hotel ahead.  Hepburn was
happy in that upper valley, that first rocking cradle of early
water.  He liked to see the great fangs and slashes of ice and snow
thrust down into the rock, as if the ice had bitten into the flesh
of the earth.  And from the fang-tips the hoarse water crying its
birth-cry, rushing down.</p>

<p>By the turfy road and under the rocks were many flowers: wonderful
harebells, big and cold and dark, almost black, and seeming like
purple-dark ice: then little tufts of tiny pale-blue bells, as if
some fairy frog had been blowing spume-bubbles out of the ice: then
the bishops-crosier of the stiff, bigger, hairy mountain-bell: then
many stars of pale-lavender gentian, touched with earth colour: and
then monkshood, yellow, primrose yellow monkshood and sudden places
full of dark monkshood.  That dark-blue, black-blue, terrible
colour of the strange rich monkshood made Hepburn look and look and
look again.  How did the ice come by that lustrous blue-purple
intense darkness? - and by that royal poison? - that laughing-snake
gorgeousness of much monkshood.</p>
