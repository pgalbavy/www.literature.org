<p>When the parents and brother of Nellie Ribsam reached the forks
a few minutes later, they saw nothing of the three parties whom
they expected to meet there.</p>

<p>"They have gone on to the woods to look for Nellie," said the
father.</p>

<p>"They cannot be far off," suggested Nick, turning to the left.</p>

<p>All were too anxious to lose a minute, and they started after
their friends on a rapid walk, Nick taking the lead, and now and
then dropping into a loping trot, which he would have increased
had he been alone.</p>

<p>A chill seemed to settle over all as they reached the deep shadow
of the woods, which was one of the largest tracts of forest in
that section of the country.</p>

<p>The road which bisected them was fully eight miles in length,
as has already been stated, while the forest was much greater
in extent in the other direction.</p>

<p>Being of such large area, there were necessarily many portions
which rarely if ever were visited by hunters. Years before an
occasional deer had been shot, and a few of the old settlers told
of the thrilling bear hunts they had enjoyed when they were not
so very much younger than now.</p>

<p>Those who were capable of judging were certain that if the gloomy
depths were explored these dreaded animals would be met; but if
such were the fact, the beasts were so few in number that no one
gave them a thought.</p>

<p>It was now four miles to Shark Creek, and, by common consent,
it was agreed that the missing Nellie must be found, if found
at all, before reaching the stream.</p>

<p>As this creek was deep enough to drown any person who could not
swim, not to mention the large pond into which it emptied, every
one of the searchers felt a vague, awful dread that poor Nellie
had fallen into the water.</p>

<p>No one spoke of it, but the thought was there all the same.</p>

<p>Shortly after entering the wood, Nick called attention to two
star-like points of light twinkling ahead of them.</p>

<p>"They are the lanterns of Mr. Layton and Kilgore," said Nick,
who immediately added, "we forgot to stop and get Mr. Marston."</p>

<p>"That is too bad, but it isn't worth while to go back now," replied
his father, hardly slackening his gait.</p>

<p>As the lantern which Mrs. Ribsam had handed to her husband was
lighted before leaving home, the men in advance detected it immediately
after they were seen themselves, and the halloo of the teacher
was answered by Nick.</p>

<p>"Have you found anything of Nellie?" asked the mother, in broken
English, as soon as the parties came together.</p>

<p>"It could scarcely be expected," answered the instructor, in
a kindly voice; "we have just got here, and have only looked along
the road. I have little doubt that she is soundly sleeping somewhere
not far off."</p>

<p>While all stood still, the father lifted up his voice, and in
clear, penetrating tones called the name of his missing child:</p>

<p>"Nellie!"</p>

<p>The ticking of the big watch in the pocket of Nick was plainly
heard as the little company awaited the answering call of the
child.</p>

<p>But it came not, and three times more was the name of the missing
girl repeated by the father, who broke down completely the last
time.</p>

<p>Nick now joined his thumb and finger against the end of his tongue,
and emitted a blast like that of a steam whistle. It resounded
among the trees, and then followed the same oppressive stillness
as before.</p>

<p>It was useless to remain where they were any longer, and, without
a word, the five moved on. The three lamps were swung above their
heads, and they peered into the gloomy depths on the right and
left.</p>

<p>Nick, as might have been expected, kept the advance, and his
father allowed him to carry the lantern. As the other lights were
behind the lad, the latter saw his huge shadow continually dancing
in front and taking all manner of grotesque shapes, while, if
the others had looked to the rear, they would have seen the same
spectacle, as it affected their own figures.</p>

<p>"Wait!" suddenly called out the father, who was now obliged to
use his broken English, "mebbe my Nellie she does hears me."</p>

<p>Thereupon he called to her as before, Nick ending the appeal
with an ear-splitting whistle, which must have been heard several
miles on such a still night.</p>

<p>Not the slightest result followed, and with heavy hearts the
little company moved on again.</p>

<p>"I think," said Mr. Layton, "that she has turned aside, where,
possibly, some faint path has caught her eye, and it may be that
we may discover the spot."</p>

<p>"Let's look here!"</p>

<p>It was the mother who spoke this time, and, as they turned toward
her, she was seen bending over the ground at the side of the highway,
where something had arrested her attention.</p>

<p>Instantly all the lanterns were clustered about the spot, and
it was seen that the eyes of affection had detected just such
a place as that named by the teacher. Persons who walked along
the road were accustomed to turn aside into the woods, and the
five now did the same, moving slowly, with the lanterns held close
to the earth, and then swung aloft, while all eyes were peering
into the portions penetrated by the yellow rays.</p>

<p>The path was followed some fifty yards, when, to the disappointment
of all, it came back to the road: it was one of those whimsical
footways often met in the country, the person who started it having
left the highway without any real reason for doing so.</p>

<p>Again the name of the missing Nellie was repeated, and again
the woods sent back nothing but the echo.</p>

<p>"Hark!"</p>

<p>It was the quick-eared Nick who spoke, just as the hum of conversation
began, and all listened.</p>

<p>As they did so the rattle of wheels was heard coming from the
direction of Dunbarton. The peculiar noise enabled the friends
to recognize it as made by a heavy, lumbering farmer's wagon.
The team was proceeding on a walk.</p>

<p>A few minutes later some one shouted:</p>

<p>"Halloo, there! what's the matter?"</p>

<p>The voice was recognized as that of Mr. Marston, whom they intended
to ask to join them.</p>

<p>Instantly a hope was aroused that he might be able to tell them
something of Nellie. Mr. Layton called back, saying they were
friends, and asking whether the farmer had seen anything of Nellie
Ribsam.</p>

<p>At this Mr. Marston whipped up his horses, which were showing
some fear of the twinkling lanterns, and halted when opposite
to the party of searchers.</p>

<p>"My gracious! is she lost?" asked the good man, forgetting the
anguish of his friends in his own curiosity.</p>

<p>"Yes, she started up this road this afternoon toward Dunbarton
to meet her brother, who was returning, but, somehow or other,
missed him, and we are all anxious about her."</p>

<p>"My gracious alive! I should think you would be: it would drive
my wife and me crazy if our Lizzie should be lost in the woods."</p>

<p>"I suppose, from the way you talk," continued the teacher, "that
you have seen nothing of her?"</p>

<p>"No, I wish I had, for I tell you these woods are a bad place
for a little girl to get lost in. Last March, when we had an inch
of snow on the ground, I seen tracks that I knowed was made by
a bear, and a mighty big one, too, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>But just then a half-smothered moan from the mother warned the
thoughtless neighbor that he was giving anything but comfort to
the afflicted parents.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," he hastened to say, in an awkward attempt to
apologize; "come to think, I am sure that it wasn't a bear, but
some big dog; you know a large dog makes tracks which can be mistook
very easy for those of a bear. I'll hurry on home and put up my
team and git the lantern and come back and help you."</p>

<p>And Mr. Marston, who meant well, whipped up his horses, and his
wagon rattled down the road as he hastened homeward.</p>
