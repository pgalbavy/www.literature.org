<p>The fire ant of the tropics does not merely bite into the animal
or person who disturbs it, but bites out, as may be said. It abstracts
a fragment of one's anatomy, so that, had General Bambos been
placed on a delicate pair of scales immediately before and after
his nipping, there would have been an appreciable difference in
his weight. Since Major Starland himself had suffered from the
fierce little pest, he understood what had befallen the other.
He tried to express his sympathy, but instead, threw back his
head and gave way to merriment.</p>

<p>The victim was suffering too much from his hurt to pay heed to
the laughter which must have struck him as untimely, but no doubt
he would have turned on the American, had not the hoarse whistle
of the tugboat sounded, and brought him hurrying from the cabin.
They were nearing the bend of the river around which the Major
had seen the catboat containing General Yozarro and his friends
disappear. That Captain Ortega was right in what he said was proved
by the emergence of the smaller craft from under the heavy foliage
along shore. In answer to the signal of the tug, it glided out
from shelter, propelled by two of the men with poles. The sail
was not hoisted, for the wind had fallen to a calm. The Captain
turned to meet the catboat, for he knew the depth of the water
permitted him to run close to the bank, but he halted when a few
rods away and waited for the other to come up.</p>

<p>General Yozarro could not be expected fully to understand the
changed conditions, with the American yacht steaming forward a
short way behind his own boat. Captain Ortega called out a brief
explanation, and the men continued poling until the smaller craft
lay alongside the larger one. General Bambos, holding to a stanchion
with one hand, reached down with the other and helped his illustrious
compatriot to climb upon his own property, the others following
more nimbly, until all had transferred themselves, and the catboat
was made fast by one of the crew.</p>

<p>The President of Zalapata, saluting and bowing low, conducted
the other dignitary to the cabin, with the officers trailing after
them. For the moment, Major Starland found his situation a trifle
embarrassing. General Yozarro scowled savagely at him, but the
others paid scant attention. There was some crowding, for it will
be remembered that the apartment was of slight size. The American
waited till a lull came in the conversation and then, with an
elaborate military salute, said:</p>

<p>"General Yozarro, I have the honor of returning to you the boat
which necessity compelled me to borrow last night."</p>

<p>The General had seated himself on the lounge, at the risk of
suffering the same mishap which had befallen his neighbor and
still kept him slyly rubbing the injured part. He was too overflowing
with rage to make any pretence to the courtesy which marked their
previous chats. His prodigious mustache bristled, his thick lips
trembled and his black eyes gleamed threateningly. He glared at
the American, standing among his own officers, who made what room
they could for him in the restricted space, and when he could
command his tumultuous feelings, he spoke:</p>

<p>"You come to surrender the boat! You surrender yourself also,
<em>el Americano</em>!"</p>

<p>"Well, hardly; I stayed aboard at the suggestion of my friend,
General Bambos, that this thing might be done in due and ancient
form. American citizens are not in the habit of surrendering at
the demand or whim of any South American nobody."</p>

<p>Removing his hat, the Major bowed low and smiled.</p>

<p>"Does he speak the truth?" bluntly asked General Yozarro, turning
to Bambos. The face of the American flushed at the slur, but he
held himself in hand.</p>

<p>"He does; he remained at my request," said General Bambos with
a nod.</p>

<p>"There were others who took part in this crime; one of them was
Captain Guzman of your staff, General."</p>

<p>"I need not assure you, General, that it was without my knowledge;
I disavow what he did and will reprimand him; if Your Excellency
demands it, I will have him shot."</p>

<p>"Not much!" muttered Major Starland, loud enough for all to hear;
"is that the way you reward one of your bravest officers, General
Bambos?"</p>

<p>"I rule in Zalapata without the aid of <em>los Americanos</em>,"
was the freezing reply.</p>

<p>"And without the aid of common gratitude and decency,&mdash;<em>that</em>
is evident."</p>

<p>"I will take the matter into consideration," said General Yozarro,
whose brain was not nimble enough to decide the simplest question
off-hand. "At present, I do not demand the death of Captain Guzman,
but I thank you for your words, General, which is only one of
the many proofs I have received of your disinterested friendship."</p>

<p>If the countenance of General Bambos had not already been as
crimson as it could well be, he would have blushed. He saluted
and muttered something about the pleasure he felt in deserving
the regard of his distinguished compatriot.</p>

<p>General Yozarro strove to restrain his anger, but it was plain
to every one that he was seething with rage. While Major Starland
was wondering what could be the cause, the explosion came:</p>

<p>"One of my men, the basest of wretches, deserted my service yesterday
and allied himself to Captain Guzman and to you. He sent me the
most shockingly insulting of messages; since he is not on this
boat, he must be on the other."</p>

<p>"Such is the fact, General," replied the Major, compressing his
lips, but looking straight into the eyes of the other.</p>

<p>"He must be surrendered to me."</p>

<p>"I receive no orders from you; you murdered the brother of Martella,
though he had done nothing wrong; the message he sent to you was
not respectful perhaps, but it was better than you deserved; Martella
has done me and mine the best of service, and he shall never be
surrendered to you."</p>

<p>The fury of General Yozarro threatened to suffocate him. He rose
to his feet and the others glanced apprehensively at the face
of the man who had dared to defy the terrible Dictator, and who
folded his arms and still looked him calmly in the eye.</p>

<p>"<em>El Americano</em>, you are here on my boat and here you
will stay till that deserter takes your place. I give you the
choice; if he is not turned over to me to be shot, you shall be
shot in his stead."</p>

<p>With all his contempt for this man, Jack Starland had never dreamed
of anything like this. The words of Captain Ortega came back to
him. There was a certain shadowy strength in the position of General
Yozarro. No flag of truce had been called into use, and the American,
after having forcibly captured the boat of the other, had voluntarily
placed himself in his power, following the suggestion of General
Bambos and his own impulses.</p>

<p>It was Bambos who broke the oppressive hush by saying to him:</p>

<p>"The words of General Yozarro are just; comply with what he demands,
and he will be glad to restore you to your friends; am I not correct,
General?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," was the sour response.</p>

<p>"Then my answer is that I'll see the whole gang of you hanged
first! You don't get Martella without the biggest fight of your
lives, and you don't keep me on this old tub without a bigger
fight; I'm not afraid of the whole pack of jail birds of you!"</p>
