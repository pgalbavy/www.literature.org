<p>The declaration was followed by a silence of some length. The Secretary
of the American Embassy and the Peruvian attaché had followed the
conversation with eager interest. Major d'Astrignac nodded his head with
an air of approval. To his mind, Perenna could not be mistaken.
</p><p>The Prefect of Police confessed:
</p><p>"Certainly, certainly ... we have a number of circumstances here ... that
are fairly ambiguous.... Those brown patches; that doctor.... It's a case
that wants looking into." And, questioning Don Luis Perenna as though in
spite of himself, he asked, "No doubt, in your opinion, there is a
possible connection between the murder ... and Mr. Mornington's will?"
</p><p>"That, Monsieur le Préfet, I cannot tell. If there is, we should have to
suppose that the contents of the will were known. Do you think they can
have leaked out, Maître Lepertuis?"
</p><p>"I don't think so, for Mr. Mornington seemed to behave with great
caution."
</p><p>"And there's no question, is there, of any indiscretion committed in
your office?"
</p><p>"By whom? No one handled the will except myself; and I alone have the
key of the safe in which I put away documents of that importance
every evening."
</p><p>"The safe has not been broken into? There has been no burglary at
your office?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"You saw Cosmo Mornington in the morning?"
</p><p>"Yes, on a Friday morning."
</p><p>"What did you do with the will until the evening, until you locked it
away up your safe?"
</p><p>"I probably put it in the drawer of my desk."
</p><p>"And the drawer was not forced?"
</p><p>Maître Lepertuis seemed taken aback and made no reply.
</p><p>"Well?" asked Perenna.
</p><p>"Well, yes, I remember ... there was something that day ... that
same Friday."
</p><p>"Are you sure?"
</p><p>"Yes. When I came in from lunch I noticed that the drawer was not locked,
although I had locked it beyond the least doubt. At the time I attached
comparatively little importance to the incident. To-day, I understand, I
understand--"
</p><p>Thus, little by little, were all the suppositions conceived by Don Luis
verified: suppositions resting, it is true, upon just one or two clues,
but yet containing an amount of intuition, of divination, that was really
surprising in a man who had been present at none of the events between
which he traced the connection so skilfully.
</p><p>"We will lose no time, Monsieur," said the Prefect of Police, "in
checking your statements, which you will confess to be a little
venturesome, by the more positive evidence of one of my detectives who
has the case in charge ... and who ought to be here by now."
</p><p>"Does his evidence bear upon Cosmo Mornington's heirs?" asked the
solicitor.
</p><p>"Upon the heirs principally, because two days ago he telephoned to me
that he had collected all the particulars, and also upon the very points
which--But wait: I remember that he spoke to my secretary of a murder
committed a month ago to-day.... Now it's a month to-day since Mr. Cosmo
Mornington--"
</p><p>M. Desmalions pressed hard on a bell. His private secretary at
once appeared.
</p><p>"Inspector Vérot?" asked the Prefect sharply.
</p><p>"He's not back yet."
</p><p>"Have him fetched! Have him brought here! He must be found at all costs
and without delay."
</p><p>He turned to Don Luis Perenna.
</p><p>"Inspector Vérot was here an hour ago, feeling rather unwell, very much
excited, it seems, and declaring that he was being watched and followed.
He said he wanted to make a most important statement to me about the
Mornington case and to warn the police of two murders which are to be
committed to-night ... and which would be a consequence of the murder of
Cosmo Mornington."
</p><p>"And he was unwell, you say?"
</p><p>"Yes, ill at ease and even very queer and imagining things. By way of
being prudent, he left a detailed report on the case for me. Well, the
report is simply a blank sheet of letter-paper.
</p><p>"Here is the paper and the envelope in which I found it, and here is a
cardboard box which he also left behind him. It contains a cake of
chocolate with the marks of teeth on it."
</p><p>"May I look at the two things you have mentioned, Monsieur le Préfet?"
</p><p>"Yes, but they won't tell you anything."
</p><p>"Perhaps so--"
</p><p>Don Luis examined at length the cardboard box and the yellow envelope,
on which were printed the words, "Café du Pont-Neuf." The others awaited
his words as though they were bound to shed an unexpected light. He
merely said:
</p><p>"The handwriting is not the same on the envelope and the box. The writing
on the envelope is less plain, a little shaky, obviously imitated."
</p><p>"Which proves--?"
</p><p>"Which proves, Monsieur le Préfet, that this yellow envelope does not
come from your detective. I presume that, after writing his report at a
table in the Café du Pont-Neuf and closing it, he had a moment of
inattention during which somebody substituted for his envelope another
with the same address, but containing a blank sheet of paper."
</p><p>"That's a supposition!" said the Prefect.
</p><p>"Perhaps; but what is certain, Monsieur le Préfet, is that your
inspector's presentiments are well-grounded, that he is being closely
watched, that the discoveries about the Mornington inheritance which he
has succeeded in making are interfering with criminal designs, and that
he is in terrible danger."
</p><p>"Come, come!"
</p><p>"He must be rescued, Monsieur le Préfet. Ever since the commencement of
this meeting I have felt persuaded that we are up against an attempt
which has already begun. I hope that it is not too late and that your
inspector has not been the first victim."
</p><p>"My dear sir," exclaimed the Prefect of Police, "you declare all this
with a conviction which rouses my admiration, but which is not enough to
establish the fact that your fears are justified. Inspector Vérot's
return will be the best proof."
</p><p>"Inspector Vérot will not return."
</p><p>"But why not?"
</p><p>"Because he has returned already. The messenger saw him return."
</p><p>"The messenger was dreaming. If you have no proof but that man's
evidence--"
</p><p>"I have another proof, Monsieur le Préfet, which Inspector Vérot himself
has left of his presence here: these few, almost illegible letters which
he scribbled on this memorandum pad, which your secretary did not see him
write and which have just caught my eye. Look at them. Are they not a
proof, a definite proof that he came back?"
</p><p>The Prefect did not conceal his perturbation. The others all seemed
impressed. The secretary's return but increased their apprehensions:
nobody had seen Inspector Vérot.
</p><p>"Monsieur le Préfet," said Don Luis, "I earnestly beg you to have the
office messenger in."
</p><p>And, as soon as the messenger was there, he asked him, without even
waiting for M. Desmalions to speak:
</p><p>"Are you sure that Inspector Vérot entered this room a second time?"
</p><p>"Absolutely sure."
</p><p>"And that he did not go out again?"
</p><p>"Absolutely sure."
</p><p>"And your attention was not distracted for a moment?"
</p><p>"Not for a moment."
</p><p>"There, Monsieur, you see!" cried the Prefect. "If Inspector Vérot were
here, we should know it."
</p><p>"He is here, Monsieur le Préfet."
</p><p>"What!"
</p><p>"Excuse my obstinacy, Monsieur le Préfet, but I say that, when some one
enters a room and does not go out again, he is still in that room."
</p><p>"Hiding?" said M. Desmalions, who was growing more and more irritated.
</p><p>"No, but fainting, ill--dead, perhaps."
</p><p>"But where, hang it all?"
</p><p>"Behind that screen."
</p><p>"There's nothing behind that screen, nothing but a door."
</p><p>"And that door--?"
</p><p>"Leads to a dressing-room."
</p><p>"Well, Monsieur le Préfet, Inspector Vérot, tottering, losing his head,
imagining himself to be going from your office to your secretary's room,
fell into your dressing-room."
</p><p>M. Desmalions ran to the door, but, at the moment of opening it, shrank
back. Was it apprehension, the wish to withdraw himself from the
influence of that astonishing man, who gave his orders with such
authority and who seemed to command events themselves?
</p><p>Don Luis stood waiting imperturbably, in a deferential attitude.
</p><p>"I cannot believe--" said M. Desmalions.
</p><p>"Monsieur le Préfet, I would remind you that Inspector Vérot's
revelations may save the lives of two persons who are doomed to die
to-night. Every minute lost is irreparable."
</p><p>M. Desmalions shrugged his shoulders. But that man mastered him with the
power of his conviction; and the Prefect opened the door.
</p><p>He did not make a movement, did not utter a cry. He simply muttered:
</p><p>"Oh, is it possible!--"
</p><p>By the pale gleam of light that entered through a ground-glass window
they saw the body of a man lying on the floor.
</p><p>"The inspector! Inspector Vérot!" gasped the office messenger,
running forward.
</p><p>He and the secretary raised the body and placed it in an armchair in the
Prefect's office.
</p><p>Inspector Vérot was still alive, but so little alive that they could
scarcely hear the beating of his heart. A drop of saliva trickled from
the corner of his mouth. His eyes were devoid of all expression. However,
certain muscles of the face kept moving, perhaps with the effort of a
will that seemed to linger almost beyond life.
</p><p>Don Luis muttered:
</p><p>"Look, Monsieur le Préfet--the brown patches!"
</p><p>The same dread unnerved all. They began to ring bells and open doors and
call for help.
</p><p>"Send for the doctor!" ordered M. Desmalions. "Tell them to bring a
doctor, the first that comes--and a priest. We can't let the poor man--"
</p><p>Don Luis raised his arm to demand silence.
</p><p>"There is nothing more to be done," he said. "We shall do better to
make the most of these last moments. Have I your permission, Monsieur
le Préfet?"
</p><p>He bent over the dying man, laid the swaying head against the back of the
chair, and, in a very gentle voice, whispered:
</p><p>"Vérot, it's Monsieur le Préfet speaking to you. We should like a few
particulars about what is to take place to-night. Do you hear me, Vérot?
If you hear me, close your eyelids."
</p><p>The eyelids were lowered. But was it not merely chance? Don Luis went on:
</p><p>"You have found the heirs of the Roussel sisters, that much we know; and
it is two of those heirs who are threatened with death. The double murder
is to be committed to-night. But what we do not know is the name of those
heirs, who are doubtless not called Roussel. You must tell us the name.
</p><p>"Listen to me: you wrote on a memorandum pad three letters which seem to
form the syllable Fau.... Am I right? Is this the first syllable of a
name? Which is the next letter after those three? Close your eyes when I
mention the right letter. Is it 'b?' Is it 'c?'"
</p><p>But there was now not a flicker in the inspector's pallid face. The head
dropped heavily on the chest. Vérot gave two or three sighs, his frame
shook with one great shiver, and he moved no more.
</p><p>He was dead.
</p><p>The tragic scene had been enacted so swiftly that the men who were
its shuddering spectators remained for a moment confounded. The
solicitor made the sign of the cross and went down on his knees. The
Prefect murmured:
</p><p>"Poor Vérot!... He was a good man, who thought only of the service, of
his duty. Instead of going and getting himself seen to--and who knows?
Perhaps he might have been saved--he came back here in the hope of
communicating his secret. Poor Vérot!--"
</p><p>"Was he married? Are there any children?" asked Don Luis.
</p><p>"He leaves a wife and three children," replied the Prefect.
</p><p>"I will look after them," said Don Luis simply.
</p><p>Then, when they brought a doctor and when M. Desmalions gave orders for
the corpse to be carried to another room, Don Luis took the doctor
aside and said:
</p><p>"There is no doubt that Inspector Vérot was poisoned. Look at his
wrist: you will see the mark of a puncture with a ring of inflammation
round it."
</p><p>"Then he was pricked in that place?"
</p><p>"Yes, with a pin or the point of a pen; and not as violently as they may
have wished, because death did not ensue until some hours later."
</p><p>The messengers removed the corpse; and soon there was no one left in the
office except the five people whom the Prefect had originally sent for.
The American Secretary of Embassy and the Peruvian attaché, considering
their continued presence unnecessary, went away, after warmly
complimenting Don Luis Perenna on his powers of penetration.
</p><p>Next came the turn of Major d'Astrignac, who shook his former subordinate
by the hand with obvious affection. And Maître Lepertais and Perenna,
having fixed an appointment for the payment of the legacy, were
themselves on the point of leaving, when M. Desmalions entered briskly.
</p><p>"Ah, so you're still here, Don Luis Perenna! I'm glad of that. I have an
idea: those three letters which you say you made out on the
writing-table, are you sure they form the syllable Fau?"
</p><p>"I think so, Monsieur le Préfet. See for yourself: are not these an 'F,'
an 'A' and a 'U?' And observe that the 'F' is a capital, which made me
suspect that the letters are the first syllable of a proper name."
</p><p>"Just so, just so," said M. Desmalions. "Well, curiously enough, that
syllable happens to be--But wait, we'll verify our facts--"
</p><p>M. Desmalions searched hurriedly among the letters which his secretary
had handed him on his arrival and which lay on a corner of the table.
</p><p>"Ah, here we are!" he exclaimed, glancing at the signature of one of the
letters. "Here we are! It's as I thought: 'Fauville.' ... The first
syllable is the same.... Look, 'Fauville,' just like that, without
Christian name or initials. The letter must have been written in a
feverish moment: there is no date nor address.... The writing is shaky--"
</p><p>And M. Desmalions read out:
</p><p><strong>"MONSIEUR LE PRÉFET:</strong>
</p><p>"A great danger is hanging over my head and over the head of my son.
Death is approaching apace. I shall have to-night, or to-morrow morning
at the latest, the proofs of the abominable plot that threatens us. I ask
leave to bring them to you in the course of the morning. I am in need of
protection and I call for your assistance.
</p><p>"Permit me to be, etc. FAUVILLE."
</p><p>"No other designation?" asked Perenna. "No letter-heading?"
</p><p>"None. But there is no mistake. Inspector Vérot's declarations agree too
evidently with this despairing appeal. It is clearly M. Fauville and his
son who are to be murdered to-night. And the terrible thing is that, as
this name of Fauville is a very common one, it is impossible for our
inquiries to succeed in time."
</p><p>"What, Monsieur le Préfet? Surely, by straining every nerve--"
</p><p>"Certainly, we will strain every nerve; and I shall set all my men to
work. But observe that we have not the slightest clue."
</p><p>"Oh, it would be awful!" cried Don Luis. "Those two creatures doomed to
death; and we unable to save them! Monsieur le Préfet, I ask you to
authorize me--"
</p><p>He had not finished speaking when the Prefect's private secretary entered
with a visiting-card in his hand.
</p><p>"Monsieur le Préfet, this caller was so persistent.... I hesitated--"
</p><p>M. Desmalions took the card and uttered an exclamation of mingled
surprise and joy.
</p><p>"Look, Monsieur," he said to Perenna.
</p><p>And he handed him the card.
</p><p> <u>Hippolyte Fauville,<br/>
   Civil Engineer.<br/>
14 bis Boulevard Suchet.</u>
</p><p>"Come," said M. Desmalions, "chance is favouring us. If this M. Fauville
is one of the Roussel heirs, our task becomes very much easier."
</p><p>"In any case, Monsieur le Préfet," the solicitor interposed, "I must
remind you that one of the clauses of the will stipulates that it shall
not be read until forty-eight hours have elapsed. M. Fauville, therefore,
must not be informed--"
</p><p>The door was pushed open and a man hustled the messenger aside and
rushed in.
</p><p>"Inspector ... Inspector Vérot?" he spluttered. "He's dead, isn't he? I
was told--"
</p><p>"Yes, Monsieur, he is dead."
</p><p>"Too late! I'm too late!" he stammered.
</p><p>And he sank into a chair, clasping his hands and sobbing:
</p><p>"Oh, the scoundrels! the scoundrels!"
</p><p>He was a pale, hollow-cheeked, sickly looking man of about fifty.
His head was bald, above a forehead lined with deep wrinkles. A
nervous twitching affected his chin and the lobes of his ears. Tears
stood in his eyes.
</p><p>The Prefect asked:
</p><p>"Whom do you mean, Monsieur? Inspector Vérot's murderers? Are you able to
name them, to assist our inquiry?"
</p><p>Hippolyte Fauville shook his head.
</p><p>"No, no, it would be useless, for the moment.... My proofs would not be
sufficient.... No, really not."
</p><p>He had already risen from his chair and stood apologizing:
</p><p>"Monsieur le Préfet, I have disturbed you unnecessarily, but I wanted to
know.... I was hoping that Inspector Vérot might have escaped.... His
evidence, joined to mine, would have been invaluable. But perhaps he was
able to tell you?"
</p><p>"No, he spoke of this evening--of to-night--"
</p><p>Hippolyte Fauville started.
</p><p>"This evening! Then the time has come!... But no, it's impossible, they
can't do anything to me yet.... They are not ready--"
</p><p>"Inspector Vérot declared, however, that the double murder would be
committed to-night."
</p><p>"No, Monsieur le Préfet, he was wrong there.... I know all about
it.... To-morrow evening at the earliest ... and we will catch them in a
trap.... Oh, the scoundrels!"
</p><p>Don Luis went up to him and asked:
</p><p>"Your mother's name was Ermeline Roussel, was it not?"
</p><p>"Yes, Ermeline Roussel. She is dead now."
</p><p>"And she was from Saint-Etienne?"
</p><p>"Yes. But why these questions?"
</p><p>"Monsieur le Préfet will tell you to-morrow. One word more." He opened
the cardboard box left by Inspector Vérot. "Does this cake of chocolate
mean anything to you? These marks?"
</p><p>"Oh, how awful!" said the civil engineer, in a hoarse tone. "Where did
the inspector find it?"
</p><p>He dropped into his chair again, but only for a moment; then, drawing
himself up, he hurried toward the door with a jerky step.
</p><p>"I'm going, Monsieur le Préfet, I'm going. To-morrow morning I'll show
you.... I shall have all the proofs.... And the police will protect
me.... I am ill, I know, but I want to live! I have the right to
live ... and my son, too.... And we will live.... Oh, the scoundrels!--"
</p><p>And he ran, stumbling out, like a drunken man.
</p><p>M. Desmalions rose hastily.
</p><p>"I shall have inquiries made about that man's circumstances.... I shall
have his house watched. I've telephoned to the detective office already.
I'm expecting some one in whom I have every confidence."
</p><p>Don Luis said:
</p><p>"Monsieur le Préfet, I beg you, with an earnestness which you will
understand, to authorize me to pursue the investigation. Cosmo
Mornington's will makes it my duty and, allow me to say, gives me the
right to do so. M. Fauville's enemies have given proofs of extraordinary
cleverness and daring. I want to have the honour of being at the post of
danger to-night, at M. Fauville's house, near his person."
</p><p>The Prefect hesitated. He was bound to reflect how greatly to Don Luis
Perenna's interest it was that none of the Mornington heirs should be
discovered, or at least be able to come between him and the millions
of the inheritance. Was it safe to attribute to a noble sentiment of
gratitude, to a lofty conception of friendship and duty, that strange
longing to protect Hippolyte Fauville against the death that
threatened him?
</p><p>For some seconds M. Desmalions watched that resolute face, those
intelligent eyes, at once innocent and satirical, grave and smiling, eyes
through which you could certainly not penetrate their owner's baffling
individuality, but which nevertheless looked at you with an expression of
absolute frankness and sincerity. Then he called his secretary:
</p><p>"Has any one come from the detective office?"
</p><p>"Yes, Monsieur le Préfet; Sergeant Mazeroux is here."
</p><p>"Please have him shown in."
</p><p>And, turning to Perenna:
</p><p>"Sergeant Mazeroux is one of our smartest detectives. I used to employ
him together with that poor Vérot when I wanted any one more than
ordinarily active and sharp. He will be of great use to you."
</p><hr/>
<p>Sergeant Mazeroux entered. He was a short, lean, wiry man, whose drooping
moustache, heavy eyelids, watery eyes and long, lank hair gave him a most
doleful appearance.
</p><p>"Mazeroux," said the Prefect, "you will have heard, by this time, of your
comrade Vérot's death and of the horrible circumstances attending it. We
must now avenge him and prevent further crimes. This gentleman, who knows
the case from end to end, will explain all that is necessary. You will
work with him and report to me to-morrow morning."
</p><p>This meant giving a free hand to Don Luis Perenna and relying on his
power of initiative and his perspicacity. Don Luis bowed:
</p><p>"I thank you, Monsieur le Préfet. I hope that you will have no reason to
regret the trust which you are good enough to place in me."
</p><p>And, taking leave of M. Desmalions and Maître Lepertuis, he went out with
Sergeant Mazeroux.
</p><p>As soon as they were outside, he told Mazeroux what he knew. The
detective seemed much impressed by his companion's professional gifts and
quite ready to be guided by his views.
</p><p>They decided first to go to the Café du Pont-Neuf. Here they learned that
Inspector Vérot, who was a regular customer of the place, had written a
long letter there that morning. And the waiter remembered that a man at
the next table, who had entered the café at almost the same time as the
inspector, had also asked for writing-paper and called twice for yellow
envelopes.
</p><p>"That's it," said Mazeroux to Don Luis. "As you suspected, one letter has
been substituted for the other."
</p><p>The description given by the waiter was pretty explicit: a tall man, with
a slight stoop, wearing a reddish-brown beard cut into a point, a
tortoise-shell eyeglass with a black silk ribbon, and an ebony
walking-stick with a handle shaped like a swan's head.
</p><p>"That's something for the police to go upon," said Mazeroux.
</p><p>They were leaving the café when Don Luis stopped his companion.
</p><p>"One moment."
</p><p>"What's the matter?"
</p><p>"We've been followed."
</p><p>"Followed? What next? And by whom, pray?"
</p><p>"No one that matters. I know who it is and I may as well settle his
business and have done with it. Wait for me. I shall be back; and I'll
show you some fun. You shall see one of the 'nuts,' I promise you."
</p><p>He returned in a minute with a tall, thin man with his face set in
whiskers. He introduced him:
</p><p>"M. Mazeroux, a friend of mine, Señor Caceres, an attaché at the Peruvian
Legation. Señor Caceres took part in the interview at the Prefect's just
now. It was he who, on the Peruvian Minister's instructions, collected
the documents bearing upon my identity." And he added gayly: "So you were
looking for me, dear Señor Caceres. Indeed, I expected, when we left the
police office--"
</p><p>The Peruvian attaché made a sign and pointed to Sergeant Mazeroux.
Perenna replied:
</p><p>"Oh, pray don't mind M. Mazeroux! You can speak before him; he is the
soul of discretion. Besides, he knows all about the business."
</p><p>The attaché was silent. Perenna made him sit down in front of him.
</p><p>"Speak without beating about the bush, dear Señor Caceres. It's a subject
that calls for plain dealing; and I don't mind a blunt word or two. It
saves such a lot of time! Come on. You want money, I suppose? Or, rather,
more money. How much?"
</p><p>The Peruvian had a final hesitation, gave a glance at Don Luis's
companion, and then, suddenly making up his mind, said in a dull voice:
</p><p>"Fifty thousand francs!"
</p><p>"Oh, by Jove, by Jove!" cried Don Luis. "You're greedy, you know! What do
you say, M. Mazeroux? Fifty thousand francs is a lot of money. Especially
as--Look here, my dear Caceres, let's go over the ground again.
</p><p>"Three years ago I had the honour of making your acquaintance in Algeria,
when you were touring the country. At the same time, I understood the
sort of man you were; and I asked you if you could manage, in three
years, with my name of Perenna, to fix me up a Spanish-Peruvian identity,
furnished with unquestionable papers and respectable ancestors. You said,
'Yes,' We settled the price: twenty thousand francs. Last week, when the
Prefect of Police asked me for my papers, I came to see you and learned
that you had just been instructed to make inquiries into my antecedents.
</p><p>"Everything was ready, as it happened. With the papers of a deceased
Peruvian nobleman, of the name of Pereira, properly revised, you had
faked me up a first-rate civic status. We arranged what you were to say
before the Prefect of Police; and I paid up the twenty thousand. We were
quits. What more do you want?"
</p><p>The Pervian attaché did not betray the least embarrassment. He put his
two elbows on the table and said, very calmly:
</p><p>"Monsieur, when treating with you, three years ago, I thought I was
dealing with a gentleman who, hiding himself under the uniform of the
Foreign Legion, wished to recover the means to live respectably
afterward. To-day, I have to do with the universal legatee of Cosmo
Mornington, with a man who, to-morrow, under a false name, will receive
the sum of one million francs and, in a few months, perhaps, the sum of a
hundred millions. That's quite a different thing."
</p><p>The argument seemed to strike Don Luis. Nevertheless, he objected:
</p><p>"And, if I refuse--?"
</p><p>"If you refuse, I shall inform the solicitor and the Prefect of Police
that I made an error in my inquiry and that there is some mistake about
Don Luis Perenna. In consequence of which you will receive nothing at all
and very likely find yourself in jail."
</p><p>"With you, my worthy sir."
</p><p>"Me?"
</p><p>"Of course: on a charge of forgery and tampering with registers. For you
don't imagine that I should take it lying down."
</p><p>The attaché did not reply. His nose, which was a very big one, seemed to
lengthen out still farther between his two long whiskers.
</p><p>Don Luis began to laugh.
</p><p>"Come, Señor Caceres, don't pull such a face! No one's going to hurt you.
Only don't think that you can corner me. Better men than you have tried
and have broken their backs in the process. And, upon my word, you don't
cut much of a figure when you're doing your best to diddle your
fellowmen.
</p><p>"You look a bit of a mug, in fact, Caceres: a bit of a mug is what you
look. So it's understood, what? We lay down our arms. No more base
designs against our excellent friend Perenna. Capital, Señor Caceres,
capital. And now I'll be magnanimous and prove to you that the decent man
of us two is--the one whom any one would have thought!"
</p><p>He produced a check-book on the Crédit Lyonnais.
</p><p>"Here, my dear chap. Here's twenty thousand francs as a present from
Cosmo Mornington's legatee. Put it in your pocket and look pleasant. Say
thank you to the kind gentleman, and make yourself scarce without turning
your head any more than if you were one of old man Lot's daughters. Off
you go: hoosh!"
</p><p>This was said in such a manner that the attaché obeyed Don Luis Perenna's
injunctions to the letter. He smiled as he pocketed the check, said thank
you twice over, and made off without turning his head.
</p><p>"The low hound!" muttered Don Luis. "What do you say to that, Sergeant?"
</p><p>Sergeant Mazeroux was looking at him in stupefaction, with his eyes
starting from his head.
</p><p>"Well, but, Monsieur--"
</p><p>"What, Sergeant?"
</p><p>"Well, but, Monsieur, who are you?"
</p><p>"Who am I?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Didn't they tell you? A Peruvian nobleman, or a Spanish nobleman, I
don't know which. In short, Don Luis Perenna."
</p><p>"Bunkum! I've just heard--"
</p><p>"Don Luis Perenna, late of the Foreign Legion."
</p><p>"Enough of that, Monsieur--"
</p><p>"Medaled and decorated with a stripe on every seam."
</p><p>"Once more, Monsieur, enough of that; and come along with me to
the Prefect."
</p><p>"But, let me finish, hang it! I was saying, late private in the Foreign
Legion.... Late hero.... Late prisoner of the Sureté.... Late Russian
prince.... Late chief of the detective service.... Late--"
</p><p>"But you're mad!" snarled the sergeant. "What's all this story?"
</p><p>"It's a true story, Sergeant, and quite genuine. You ask me who I am; and
I'm telling you categorically. Must I go farther back? I have still more
titles to offer you: marquis, baron, duke, archduke, grand-duke,
petty-duke, superduke--the whole 'Almanach de Gotha,' by Jingo! If any
one told me that I had been a king, by all that's holy, I shouldn't dare
swear to the contrary!"
</p><p>Sergeant Mazeroux put out his own hands, accustomed to rough work, seized
the seemingly frail wrists of the man addressing him and said:
</p><p>"No nonsense, now. I don't know whom I've got hold of, but I shan't let
you go. You can say what you have to say at the Prefect's."
</p><p>"Don't speak so loud, Alexandre."
</p><p>The two frail wrists were released with unparalleled ease; the sergeant's
powerful hands were caught and rendered useless; and Don Luis grinned:
</p><p>"Don't you know me, you idiot?"
</p><p>Sergeant Mazeroux did not utter a word. His eyes started still farther
from his head. He tried to understand and remained absolutely dumfounded.
</p><p>The sound of that voice, that way of jesting, that schoolboy playfulness
allied with that audacity, the quizzing expression of those eyes, and
lastly that Christian name of Alexandre, which was not his name at all
and which only one person used to give him, years ago. Was it possible?
</p><p>"The chief!" he stammered. "The chief!"
</p><p>"Why not?"
</p><p>"No, no, because--"
</p><p>"Because what?"
</p><p>"Because you're dead."
</p><p>"Well, what about it? D'you think it interferes with my living,
being dead?"
</p><p>And, as the other seemed more and more perplexed, he laid his hand on his
shoulder and said:
</p><p>"Who put you into the police office?"
</p><p>"The Chief Detective, M. Lenormand."
</p><p>"And who was M. Lenormand?"
</p><p>"The chief."
</p><p>"You mean Arsène Lupin, don't you?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Well, Alexandre, don't you know that it was much more difficult for
Arsène Lupin to be Chief Detective--and a masterly Chief Detective he
was--than to be Don Luis Perenna, to be decorated in the Foreign Legion,
to be a hero, and even to be alive after he was dead?"
</p><p>Sergeant Mazeroux examined his companion in silence. Then his lacklustre
eyes brightened, his drab features turned scarlet and, suddenly striking
the table with his fist, he growled, in an angry voice:
</p><p>"All right, very well! But I warn you that you mustn't reckon on me. No,
not that! I'm in the detective service; and in the detective service I
remain. Nothing doing. I've tasted honesty and I mean to eat no other
bread. No, no, no, no! No more humbug!"
</p><p>Perenna shrugged his shoulders:
</p><p>"Alexandre, you're an ass. Upon my word, the bread of honesty hasn't
enlarged your intelligence. Who talked of starting again?"
</p><p>"But--"
</p><p>"But what?"
</p><p>"All your maneuvers, Chief."
</p><p>"My maneuvers! Do you think I have anything to say to this business?"
</p><p>"Look here, Chief--"
</p><p>"Why, I'm out of it altogether, my lad! Two hours ago I knew no more
about it than you do. It's Providence that chucked this legacy at me,
without so much as shouting, 'Heads!' And it's in obedience to the
decrees of--"
</p><p>"Then--?"
</p><p>"It's my mission in life to avenge Cosmo Mornington, to find his natural
heirs, to protect them and to divide among them the hundred millions
that belong to them. That's all. Don't you call that the mission of an
honest man?"
</p><p>"Yes, but--"
</p><p>"Yes, but, if I don't fulfil it as an honest man: is that what you mean?"
</p><p>"Chief--"
</p><p>"Well, my lad, if you notice the least thing in my conduct that
dissatisfies you, if you discover a speck of black on Don Luis Perenna's
conscience, examined under the magnifying glass, don't hesitate: collar
me with both hands. I authorize you to do it. I order you to do it. Is
that enough for you?"
</p><p>"It's not enough for it to be enough for me, Chief."
</p><p>"What are you talking about?"
</p><p>"There are the others."
</p><p>"Explain yourself."
</p><p>"Suppose you're nabbed?"
</p><p>"How?"
</p><p>"You can be betrayed."
</p><p>"By whom?"
</p><p>"Your old mates."
</p><p>"Gone away. I've sent them out of France."
</p><p>"Where to?"
</p><p>"That's my secret. I left you at the police office, in case I should
require your services; and you see that I was right."
</p><p>"But suppose the police discover your real identity?"
</p><p>"Well?"
</p><p>"They'll arrest you."
</p><p>"Impossible!"
</p><p>"Why?"
</p><p>"They can't arrest me."
</p><p>"For what reason?"
</p><p>"You've said it yourself, fat-head: a first-class, tremendous,
indisputable reason."
</p><p>"What do you mean?"
</p><p>"<u>I'm dead</u>!"
</p><p>Mazeroux seemed staggered. The argument struck him fully. He at once
perceived it, with all its common sense and all its absurdity. And
suddenly he burst into a roar of laughter which bent him in two and
convulsed his doleful features in the oddest fashion:
</p><p>"Oh, Chief, just the same as always!... Lord, how funny!... Will I come
along? I should think I would! As often as you like! You're dead and
buried and put out of sight!... Oh, what a joke, what a joke!"
</p><hr/>
<p>Hippolyte Fauville, civil engineer, lived on the Boulevard Suchet, near
the fortifications, in a fair-sized private house having on its left a
small garden in which he had built a large room that served as his study.
The garden was thus reduced to a few trees and to a strip of grass along
the railings, which were covered with ivy and contained a gate that
opened on the Boulevard Suchet.
</p><p>Don Luis Perenna went with Mazeroux to the commissary's office at Passy,
where Mazeroux, on Perenna's instructions, gave his name and asked to
have M. Fauville's house watched during the night by two policemen who
were to arrest any suspicious person trying to obtain admission. The
commissary agreed to the request.
</p><p>Don Luis and Mazeroux next dined in the neighbourhood. At nine o'clock
they reached the front door of the house.
</p><p>"Alexandre," said Perenna.
</p><p>"Yes, Chief?"
</p><p>"You're not afraid?"
</p><p>"No, Chief. Why should I be?"
</p><p>"Why? Because, in defending M. Fauville and his son, we are attacking
people who have a great interest in doing away with them and because
those people seem pretty wide-awake. Your life, my life: a breath, a
trifle. You're not afraid?"
</p><p>"Chief," replied Mazeroux, "I can't say if I shall ever know what it
means to be afraid. But there's one case in which I certainly shall
never know."
</p><p>"What case is that, old chap?"
</p><p>"As long as I'm by your side, Chief."
</p><p>And firmly he rang the bell.
