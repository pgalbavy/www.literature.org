<p>Messrs. Grateley and Hooper, the solicitors in whose firm Ralph
Denham was clerk, had their office in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and
there Ralph Denham appeared every morning very punctually at ten
o’clock. His punctuality, together with other qualities, marked
him out among the clerks for success, and indeed it would have
been safe to wager that in ten years’ time or so one would find
him at the head of his profession, had it not been for a peculiarity
which sometimes seemed to make everything about him uncertain
and perilous. His sister Joan had already been disturbed by his
love of gambling with his savings. Scrutinizing him constantly
with the eye of affection, she had become aware of a curious perversity
in his temperament which caused her much anxiety, and would have
caused her still more if she had not recognized the germs of it
in her own nature. She could fancy Ralph suddenly sacrificing
his entire career for some fantastic imagination; some cause or
idea or even (so her fancy ran) for some woman seen from a railway
train, hanging up clothes in a back yard. When he had found this
beauty or this cause, no force, she knew, would avail to restrain
him from pursuit of it. She suspected the East also, and always
fidgeted herself when she saw him with a book of Indian travels
in his hand, as though he were sucking contagion from the page.
On the other hand, no common love affair, had there been such
a thing, would have caused her a moment’s uneasiness where Ralph
was concerned. He was destined in her fancy for something splendid
in the way of success or failure, she knew not which.</p>

<p>And yet nobody could have worked harder or done better in all
the recognized stages of a young man’s life than Ralph had done,
and Joan had to gather materials for her fears from trifles in
her brother’s behavior which would have escaped any other eye.
It was natural that she should be anxious. Life had been so arduous
for all of them from the start that she could not help dreading
any sudden relaxation of his grasp upon what he held, though,
as she knew from inspection of her own life, such sudden impulse
to let go and make away from the discipline and the drudgery was
sometimes almost irresistible. But with Ralph, if he broke away,
she knew that it would be only to put himself under harsher constraint;
she figured him toiling through sandy deserts under a tropical
sun to find the source of some river or the haunt of some fly;
she figured him living by the labor of his hands in some city
slum, the victim of one of those terrible theories of right and
wrong which were current at the time; she figured him prisoner
for life in the house of a woman who had seduced him by her misfortunes.
Half proudly, and wholly anxiously, she framed such thoughts,
as they sat, late at night, talking together over the gas-stove
in Ralph’s bedroom.</p>

<p>It is likely that Ralph would not have recognized his own dream
of a future in the forecasts which disturbed his sister’s peace
of mind. Certainly, if any one of them had been put before him
he would have rejected it with a laugh, as the sort of life that
held no attractions for him. He could not have said how it was
that he had put these absurd notions into his sister’s head. Indeed,
he prided himself upon being well broken into a life of hard work,
about which he had no sort of illusions. His vision of his own
future, unlike many such forecasts, could have been made public
at any moment without a blush; he attributed to himself a strong
brain, and conferred on himself a seat in the House of Commons
at the age of fifty, a moderate fortune, and, with luck, an unimportant
office in a Liberal Government. There was nothing extravagant
in a forecast of that kind, and certainly nothing dishonorable.
Nevertheless, as his sister guessed, it needed all Ralph’s strength
of will, together with the pressure of circumstances, to keep
his feet moving in the path which led that way. It needed, in
particular, a constant repetition of a phrase to the effect that
he shared the common fate, found it best of all, and wished for
no other; and by repeating such phrases he acquired punctuality
and habits of work, and could very plausibly demonstrate that
to be a clerk in a solicitor’s office was the best of all possible
lives, and that other ambitions were vain.</p>

<p>But, like all beliefs not genuinely held, this one depended very
much upon the amount of acceptance it received from other people,
and in private, when the pressure of public opinion was removed,
Ralph let himself swing very rapidly away from his actual circumstances
upon strange voyages which, indeed, he would have been ashamed
to describe. In these dreams, of course, he figured in noble and
romantic parts, but self-glorification was not the only motive
of them. They gave outlet to some spirit which found no work to
do in real life, for, with the pessimism which his lot forced
upon him, Ralph had made up his mind that there was no use for
what, contemptuously enough, he called dreams, in the world which
we inhabit. It sometimes seemed to him that this spirit was the
most valuable possession he had; he thought that by means of it
he could set flowering waste tracts of the earth, cure many ills,
or raise up beauty where none now existed; it was, too, a fierce
and potent spirit which would devour the dusty books and parchments
on the office wall with one lick of its tongue, and leave him
in a minute standing in nakedness, if he gave way to it. His endeavor,
for many years, had been to control the spirit, and at the age
of twenty-nine he thought he could pride himself upon a life rigidly
divided into the hours of work and those of dreams; the two lived
side by side without harming each other. As a matter of fact,
this effort at discipline had been helped by the interests of
a difficult profession, but the old conclusion to which Ralph
had come when he left college still held sway in his mind, and
tinged his views with the melancholy belief that life for most
people compels the exercise of the lower gifts and wastes the
precious ones, until it forces us to agree that there is little
virtue, as well as little profit, in what once seemed to us the
noblest part of our inheritance.</p>

<p>Denham was not altogether popular either in his office or among
his family. He was too positive, at this stage of his career,
as to what was right and what wrong, too proud of his self-control,
and, as is natural in the case of persons not altogether happy
or well suited in their conditions, too apt to prove the folly
of contentment, if he found any one who confessed to that weakness.
In the office his rather ostentatious efficiency annoyed those
who took their own work more lightly, and, if they foretold his
advancement, it was not altogether sympathetically. Indeed, he
appeared to be rather a hard and self-sufficient young man, with
a queer temper, and manners that were uncompromisingly abrupt,
who was consumed with a desire to get on in the world, which was
natural, these critics thought, in a man of no means, but not
engaging.</p>

<p>The young men in the office had a perfect right to these opinions,
because Denham showed no particular desire for their friendship.
He liked them well enough, but shut them up in that compartment
of life which was devoted to work. Hitherto, indeed, he had found
little difficulty in arranging his life as methodically as he
arranged his expenditure, but about this time he began to encounter
experiences which were not so easy to classify. Mary Datchet had
begun this confusion two years ago by bursting into laughter at
some remark of his, almost the first time they met. She could
not explain why it was. She thought him quite astonishingly odd.
When he knew her well enough to tell her how he spent Monday and
Wednesday and Saturday, she was still more amused; she laughed
till he laughed, too, without knowing why. It seemed to her very
odd that he should know as much about breeding bulldogs as any
man in England; that he had a collection of wild flowers found
near London; and his weekly visit to old Miss Trotter at Ealing,
who was an authority upon the science of Heraldry, never failed
to excite her laughter. She wanted to know everything, even the
kind of cake which the old lady supplied on these occasions; and
their summer excursions to churches in the neighborhood of London
for the purpose of taking rubbings of the brasses became most
important festivals, from the interest she took in them. In six
months she knew more about his odd friends and hobbies than his
own brothers and sisters knew, after living with him all his life;
and Ralph found this very pleasant, though disordering, for his
own view of himself had always been profoundly serious.</p>

<p>Certainly it was very pleasant to be with Mary Datchet and to
become, directly the door was shut, quite a different sort of
person, eccentric and lovable, with scarcely any likeness to the
self most people knew. He became less serious, and rather less
dictatorial at home, for he was apt to hear Mary laughing at him,
and telling him, as she was fond of doing, that he knew nothing
at all about anything. She made him, also, take an interest in
public questions, for which she had a natural liking; and was
in process of turning him from Tory to Radical, after a course
of public meetings, which began by boring him acutely, and ended
by exciting him even more than they excited her.</p>

<p>But he was reserved; when ideas started up in his mind, he divided
them automatically into those he could discuss with Mary, and
those he must keep for himself. She knew this and it interested
her, for she was accustomed to find young men very ready to talk
about themselves, and had come to listen to them as one listens
to children, without any thought of herself. But with Ralph, she
had very little of this maternal feeling, and, in consequence,
a much keener sense of her own individuality.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon Ralph stepped along the Strand to an interview
with a lawyer upon business. The afternoon light was almost over,
and already streams of greenish and yellowish artificial light
were being poured into an atmosphere which, in country lanes,
would now have been soft with the smoke of wood fires; and on
both sides of the road the shop windows were full of sparkling
chains and highly polished leather cases, which stood upon shelves
made of thick plate-glass. None of these different objects was
seen separately by Denham, but from all of them he drew an impression
of stir and cheerfulness. Thus it came about that he saw Katharine
Hilbery coming towards him, and looked straight at her, as if
she were only an illustration of the argument that was going forward
in his mind. In this spirit he noticed the rather set expression
in her eyes, and the slight, half-conscious movement of her lips,
which, together with her height and the distinction of her dress,
made her look as if the scurrying crowd impeded her, and her direction
were different from theirs. He noticed this calmly; but suddenly,
as he passed her, his hands and knees began to tremble, and his
heart beat painfully. She did not see him, and went on repeating
to herself some lines which had stuck to her memory: "It’s life
that matters, nothing but life&mdash;the process of discovering&mdash;the
everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery itself at
all." Thus occupied, she did not see Denham, and he had not the
courage to stop her. But immediately the whole scene in the Strand
wore that curious look of order and purpose which is imparted
to the most heterogeneous things when music sounds; and so pleasant
was this impression that he was very glad that he had not stopped
her, after all. It grew slowly fainter, but lasted until he stood
outside the barrister’s chambers.</p>

<p>When his interview with the barrister was over, it was too late
to go back to the office. His sight of Katharine had put him queerly
out of tune for a domestic evening. Where should he go? To walk
through the streets of London until he came to Katharine’s house,
to look up at the windows and fancy her within, seemed to him
possible for a moment; and then he rejected the plan almost with
a blush as, with a curious division of consciousness, one plucks
a flower sentimentally and throws it away, with a blush, when
it is actually picked. No, he would go and see Mary Datchet. By
this time she would be back from her work.</p>

<p>To see Ralph appear unexpectedly in her room threw Mary for a
second off her balance. She had been cleaning knives in her little
scullery, and when she had let him in she went back again, and
turned on the cold-water tap to its fullest volume, and then turned
it off again. "Now," she thought to herself, as she screwed it
tight, "I’m not going to let these silly ideas come into my head....
Don’t you think Mr. Asquith deserves to be hanged?" she called
back into the sitting-room, and when she joined him, drying her
hands, she began to tell him about the latest evasion on the part
of the Government with respect to the Women’s Suffrage Bill. Ralph
did not want to talk about politics, but he could not help respecting
Mary for taking such an interest in public questions. He looked
at her as she leant forward, poking the fire, and expressing herself
very clearly in phrases which bore distantly the taint of the
platform, and he thought, "How absurd Mary would think me if she
knew that I almost made up my mind to walk all the way to Chelsea
in order to look at Katharine’s windows. She wouldn’t understand
it, but I like her very much as she is."</p>

<p>For some time they discussed what the women had better do; and
as Ralph became genuinely interested in the question, Mary unconsciously
let her attention wander, and a great desire came over her to
talk to Ralph about her own feelings; or, at any rate, about something
personal, so that she might see what he felt for her; but she
resisted this wish. But she could not prevent him from feeling
her lack of interest in what he was saying, and gradually they
both became silent. One thought after another came up in Ralph’s
mind, but they were all, in some way, connected with Katharine,
or with vague feelings of romance and adventure such as she inspired.
But he could not talk to Mary about such thoughts; and he pitied
her for knowing nothing of what he was feeling. "Here," he thought,
"is where we differ from women; they have no sense of romance."</p>

<p>"Well, Mary," he said at length, "why don’t you say something
amusing?"</p>

<p>His tone was certainly provoking, but, as a general rule, Mary
was not easily provoked. This evening, however, she replied rather
sharply:</p>

<p>"Because I’ve got nothing amusing to say, I suppose."</p>

<p>Ralph thought for a moment, and then remarked:</p>

<p>"You work too hard. I don’t mean your health," he added, as she
laughed scornfully, "I mean that you seem to me to be getting
wrapped up in your work."</p>

<p>"And is that a bad thing?" she asked, shading her eyes with her
hand.</p>

<p>"I think it is," he returned abruptly.</p>

<p>"But only a week ago you were saying the opposite." Her tone
was defiant, but she became curiously depressed. Ralph did not
perceive it, and took this opportunity of lecturing her, and expressing
his latest views upon the proper conduct of life. She listened,
but her main impression was that he had been meeting some one
who had influenced him. He was telling her that she ought to read
more, and to see that there were other points of view as deserving
of attention as her own. Naturally, having last seen him as he
left the office in company with Katharine, she attributed the
change to her; it was likely that Katharine, on leaving the scene
which she had so clearly despised, had pronounced some such criticism,
or suggested it by her own attitude. But she knew that Ralph would
never admit that he had been influenced by anybody.</p>

<p>"You don’t read enough, Mary," he was saying. "You ought to read
more poetry."</p>

<p>It was true that Mary’s reading had been rather limited to such
works as she needed to know for the sake of examinations; and
her time for reading in London was very little. For some reason,
no one likes to be told that they do not read enough poetry, but
her resentment was only visible in the way she changed the position
of her hands, and in the fixed look in her eyes. And then she
thought to herself, "I’m behaving exactly as I said I wouldn’t
behave," whereupon she relaxed all her muscles and said, in her
reasonable way:</p>

<p>"Tell me what I ought to read, then."</p>

<p>Ralph had unconsciously been irritated by Mary, and he now delivered
himself of a few names of great poets which were the text for
a discourse upon the imperfection of Mary’s character and way
of life.</p>

<p>"You live with your inferiors," he said, warming unreasonably,
as he knew, to his text. "And you get into a groove because, on
the whole, it’s rather a pleasant groove. And you tend to forget
what you’re there for. You’ve the feminine habit of making much
of details. You don’t see when things matter and when they don’t.
And that’s what’s the ruin of all these organizations. That’s
why the Suffragists have never done anything all these years.
What’s the point of drawing-room meetings and bazaars? You want
to have ideas, Mary; get hold of something big; never mind making
mistakes, but don’t niggle. Why don’t you throw it all up for
a year, and travel?&mdash;see something of the world. Don’t be content
to live with half a dozen people in a backwater all your life.
But you won’t," he concluded.</p>

<p>"I’ve rather come to that way of thinking myself&mdash;about myself,
I mean,"  said Mary, surprising him by her acquiescence. "I should
like to go somewhere far away."</p>

<p>For a moment they were both silent. Ralph then said:</p>

<p>"But look here, Mary, you haven’t been taking this seriously,
have you?"  His irritation was spent, and the depression, which
she could not keep out of her voice, made him feel suddenly with
remorse that he had been hurting her.</p>

<p>"You won’t go away, will you?" he asked. And as she said nothing,
he added, "Oh no, don’t go away."</p>

<p>"I don’t know exactly what I mean to do," she replied. She hovered
on the verge of some discussion of her plans, but she received
no encouragement. He fell into one of his queer silences, which
seemed to Mary, in spite of all her precautions, to have reference
to what she also could not prevent herself from thinking about&mdash;their
feeling for each other and their relationship. She felt that the
two lines of thought bored their way in long, parallel tunnels
which came very close indeed, but never ran into each other.</p>

<p>When he had gone, and he left her without breaking his silence
more than was needed to wish her good night, she sat on for a
time, reviewing what he had said. If love is a devastating fire
which melts the whole being into one mountain torrent, Mary was
no more in love with Denham than she was in love with her poker
or her tongs. But probably these extreme passions are very rare,
and the state of mind thus depicted belongs to the very last stages
of love, when the power to resist has been eaten away, week by
week or day by day. Like most intelligent people, Mary was something
of an egoist, to the extent, that is, of attaching great importance
to what she felt, and she was by nature enough of a moralist to
like to make certain, from time to time, that her feelings were
creditable to her. When Ralph left her she thought over her state
of mind, and came to the conclusion that it would be a good thing
to learn a language&mdash;say Italian or German. She then went to a
drawer, which she had to unlock, and took from it certain deeply
scored manuscript pages. She read them through, looking up from
her reading every now and then and thinking very intently for
a few seconds about Ralph. She did her best to verify all the
qualities in him which gave rise to emotions in her; and persuaded
herself that she accounted reasonably for them all. Then she looked
back again at her manuscript, and decided that to write grammatical
English prose is the hardest thing in the world. But she thought
about herself a great deal more than she thought about grammatical
English prose or about Ralph Denham, and it may therefore be disputed
whether she was in love, or, if so, to which branch of the family
her passion belonged.</p>
