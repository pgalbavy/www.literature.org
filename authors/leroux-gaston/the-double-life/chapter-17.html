<p><em>MELIPHASTE </em>had been reasoning with Théophraste, and
using all the arguments of spiritualists to persuade him to make
an effort to rid himself of the spirit of Cartouche.</p>

<p>"However," said Théophraste, "I thank you for the interest you
have taken in me, and for your sympathy; but I tell you, you can
do nothing for me. You say I am sick, but I am not. If I were
you could cure me. You also say that I am to drive away this Cartouche;
but, though that is easily said, I can assure you that it is not
so easily done. It is impossible, my dear M. Eli-phaste."</p>

<p>"And yet," said M. Eliphaste, "it is necessary. For if we do
not succeed in driving him out, we must kill him. That is an operation
the result of which I cannot vouch. It is a delicate operation,
and full of dangers."</p>

<p>M. Eliphaste had hoped that this obsession of Cartouche was only
imaginary, and so by reasoning he could drive it away. But, alas,
the reality of it was only too true, and Théophraste, while willing
to help him, could not get himself to believe M. Eliphaste’s arguments.</p>

<p>"You understand," said M. Eliphaste, "your case is most extraordinary.
Everybody in the world has lived before, and will live again.
This is the Law of Karma. It may be possible to find some one
who was a friend of Cartouche’s. The true object of that wonderful
evolution of souls through the bodies, is to develop and qualify
them to enjoy the perfect happiness which will finally be the
inheritance of the fortunate ones who will enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven. It is thought that at each birth, the personality differs
from the preceding one, but it is only the veritable, divine and
spiritual I. These divers personalities are in some measures only
the links of the infinite chain of life, which constitutes, throughout
the ages, our immortal individuality."</p>

<p>The admirable wisdom of the teaching appealed to Théophraste
immensely. Eliphaste had shown himself so much the master of his
thoughts, that he could not understand why he had remained ignorant
so long, without even having suspected these wonderful truths.
He saw the great difference between Eliphaste and Adolphe, the
difference, as he said, "between the Man of Reason and the Learned
Ape."</p>

<p>Eliphaste continued: "When one is persuaded of this great truth,
one need not be astonished at the wonderful things that happen
in the present—if they recall events of former times. But to live
according to the Law of Wisdom, one must live in the present,
and not look behind."</p>

<p>Théophraste had too often looked behind. His mind had occupied
itself with thoughts of the past. If this had continued, in a
very short time Théophraste would have gone quite mad.</p>

<p>And so Théophraste thought: "I must either forget Cartouche,
throw him off completely, or develop all his characteristics."</p>

<p>M. Eliphaste told them that what men call vocations to-day were
only a latent revelation of the past, and they could only be explained
that way. He told them that what was called facility among men
to-day was nothing else but retrospective sympathy for some objects
that they knew better than others, having studied them better
before the real and actual life. He said that we even assume the
gesture of the past without knowing it. He himself had seen, on
the eve of the Battle of the Bourget, two young men fall near
him, handsome as demigods, brave as Castor and Pollux, and who
succumbed with grace that the heroes showed in dying at Salamis,
Marathon, or at Platies. M. Eliphaste then pressed Théophraste
to his heart, breathed on his forehead and his eyes, and then
asked him if he was quite persuaded of the truth. He said that
to be happy we must seek to give an account of ourselves, as to
the perpetual changes of our condition, and that by this we learned
to live in the present, and to comprehend that the future belonged
to us entirely. Are we not the children of the Eternal, in whose
eyes a thousand years are as a day, and a day as a thousand years?</p>

<p>Théophraste said to him that he was not at all astonished at
having been Cartouche—it seemed so natural to his mind—that he
would never more dwell on it, and he declared that at present
Cartouche was driven away.</p>

<p>Thereupon Marceline asked what time it was, and Adolphe told
her it was eleven o’clock, and so they rose to take their leave.
However, just before leaving, an incident occurred which went
to prove too clearly that the spirit of Cartouche had not left
Théophraste.</p>

<p>Upon Adolphe’s declaring that it was eleven o’clock, Théophraste
took out his watch and contended that it was half after eleven,
and after a few words, he said, "You can cut off my right hand
if I am wrong."</p>

<p>Turning to M. Eliphaste, that gentleman confirmed M. Lecamus’
statement, whereupon Théophraste picked up a small knife which
was lying near, and would have severed his right hand but for
M. Eliphaste, who, grasping the situation, seized Théophraste’s
uplifted hand with dexterity and incredible strength. He ordered
him to drop the knife, and told him that he was not keeping to
the compact. M. Eliphaste felt that it was no good arguing with
him on the matter of the spirit of Cartouche, and despaired of
ever ridding him of the spirit by reasoning. He turned to Adolphe
and said, "Let us go. It is too late. There is nothing to do but
to kill him."</p>
