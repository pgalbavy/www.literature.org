<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Berkley, hollow-eyed, ghastly white, but smiling, glanced at
the clock.</p>

<p>"Only one more hand after this," he said.  "I open it for the
limit."</p>

<p>"All in," said Cortlandt briefly.  "What are you going to do
now?"</p>

<p>"<em>Scindere glaciem</em>," observed Berkley, "you may give
me three cards, Cortlandt."  He took them, scanned his hand, tossed
the discards into the centre of the table, and bet ten dollars.
Through the tobacco smoke drifting in level bands, the crystal
chandeliers in Cortlandt's house glimmered murkily; the cigar
haze even stretched away into the farther room, where, under brilliantly
lighted side brackets, a young girl sat playing at the piano,
a glass of champagne, gone flat, at her dimpled elbow.  Another
girl, in a shrimp-pink evening gown, one silken knee drooping
over the other, lay half buried among the cushions, singing the
air which the player at the piano picked out by ear.  A third
girl, velvet-eyed and dark of hair, listened pensively, turning
the gems on her fingers.</p>

<p>The pretty musician at the piano was playing an old song, once
much admired by the sentimental; the singer, reclining amid her
cushions, sang the words, absently:</p>

<p>  "Why did I give my heart away-  Give it so lightly, give it
to pay   For a pleasant dream on a summer's day?</p>

<p>  "Why did I give?  I do not know.   Surely the passing years
will show.</p>

<p>  "Why did I give my love away-  Give it in April, give it in
May,   For a young man's smile on a summer's day?</p>

<p>  "Why did I love?  I do not know.   Perhaps the passing years
will show.</p>

<p>  "Why did I give my soul away-  Give it so gaily, give it to
pay   For a sigh and a kiss on a summer's day?</p>

<p>  "Perhaps the passing years may show;   My heart and I, we do
not know."</p>

<p>She broke off short, swung on the revolving chair, and called:
"Mr. Berkley, <em>are</em> you going to see me home?"</p>

<p>"Last jack, Miss Carew," said Berkley, "I'm opening it for the
limit.  Give me one round of fixed ammunition, Arthur."</p>

<p>"There's no use drawing," observed another man, laying down his
hand, "Berkley cleans us up <em>as</em> usual."</p>

<p>He was right; everything went to Berkley, as usual, who laughed
and turned a dissipated face to Casson.</p>

<p>"Cold decks?" he suggested politely.  "Your revenge at your convenience,
Jack."</p>

<p>Casson declined.  Cortlandt, in his brilliant zouave uniform,
stood up and stretched his arms until the scarlet chevrons on
the blue sleeves wrinkled into jagged lightning.</p>

<p>"It's been very kind of you all to come to my last 'good-bye
party,'" he yawned, looking sleepily around him through the smoke
at his belongings.</p>

<p>For a week he had been giving a "good-bye party" every evening
in his handsome house on Twenty-third Street.  The four men and
the three young girls in the other room were the residue of this
party, which was to be the last.</p>

<p>Arthur Wye, wearing the brand-new uniform, red stripes and facings,
of flying artillery, rose also; John Casson buttoned his cavalry
jacket, grumbling, and stood heavily erect, a colossus in blue
and yellow.</p>

<p>"You have the devil's luck, Berkley," he said without bitterness.</p>

<p>"I need it."</p>

<p>"So you do, poor old boy.  But &mdash;God! you play like a professional."</p>

<p>Wye yawned, thrust his strong, thin hands into his trousers pockets,
and looked stupidly at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"I wish to heaven they'd start our battery," he said vacantly.
"I'm that sick of Hamilton!"</p>

<p>Casson grumbled again, settling his debts with Berkley.</p>

<p>"Everybody has the devil's own luck except the poor God-forsaken
cavalry.  Billy Cortlandt goes tomorrow, your battery is under
orders, but nobody cares what happens to the cavalry.  And they're
the eyes and ears of an army&#11834;"</p>

<p>"They're the heels and tail of it," observed Berkley, "and the
artillery is the rump."</p>

<p>"Shut up, you sneering civilian!"</p>

<p>"I'm shutting up&mdash;shop&mdash;unless anybody cares to try one last
cold hand&mdash;" He caught the eye of the girl at the piano and smiled
pallidly.  "'<em>Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, auri sacra fames</em>!'
Also I have them all scared to death, Miss Carew&mdash;the volunteer
army of our country is taking water."</p>

<p>"It doesn't taste like water," said the pretty singer on the
sofa, stretching out her bubbling glass, "try it yourself, Mr.
Berkley."</p>

<p>They went toward the music room; Cortlandt seated himself on
top of the piano.  He looked rather odd there in his zouave jacket,
red trousers, white-gaitered legs hanging.</p>

<p>  "Oh the Zou-zou-zou!   Oh the Zou-zou-zou!   Oh the boys of
the bully Zouaves!"</p>

<p>he hummed, swinging his legs vigorously.  "Ladies and gentlemen,
it's all over but the shooting.  Arthur, I saw your battery horses;
they belong in a glue factory.  How arc you going to save your
guns when the rebs come after you?"</p>

<p>"God knows, especially if the Zouaves support us," replied Wye,
yawning again.  Then, rising:</p>

<p>"I've got to get back to that cursed fort.  I'll escort anybody
who'll let me."</p>

<p>"One more glass, then," said Cortlandt.  "Berkley, fill the parting
cup!  Ladies of the Canterbury, fair sharers of our hospitality
who have left the triumphs of the drama to cheer the unfortunate
soldier on his war-ward way, I raise my glass and drink to each
Terpsichorean toe which, erstwhile, was pointed skyward amid the
thunder of metropolitan plaudits, and which now demurely taps
my flattered carpet.  Gentlemen&mdash;soldiers and civilians &mdash;I
give you three toasts!  Miss Carew, Miss Lynden, Miss Trent! 
Long may they dance!  Hurrah!"</p>

<p>"Get on the table," said Casson amid the cheering, and climbed
up, spurs jingling, glass on high.</p>

<p>"Will it hold us all?" inquired Letty Lynden, giving her hands
to Berkley, who shrugged and swung her up beside him.  "Hurrah
for the Zouaves!" she cried; "Hurrah for Billy Cortlandt! &mdash;Oh,
somebody spilled champagne all over me!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the artillery!" shouted Arthur Wye, vigorously cheering
himself and waving his glass, to the terror of Ione Carew, who
attempted to dodge the sparkling rain in vain.</p>

<p>"Arthur, you look like a troop of trained mice," observed Berkley
gravely.  "Has anybody a toy cannon and a little flag?"</p>

<p>Wye descended with a hop, sprang astride a chair, and clattered
around the room, imitating his drill-master.</p>

<p>"Attention!  By the right of batteries, break into sections,
trot. Mar-r-rch!  Attention-n-n!  By section from the right of
batteries&mdash;front into column.  Mar-r-rch!"</p>

<p>"By section from the right, front into column, march!" repeated
Cortlandt, jumping down from the table and seizing another chair.
"Everybody mount a chair!" he shouted.  "This is the last artillery
drill of the season.  Line up there, Letty!  It won't hurt your
gown.  Berkley'll get you another, anyway!  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
sit firmly in your saddles.  Caissons to the rear&mdash;march!  Caissons,
left about&mdash;pieces forward&mdash;march!"</p>

<p>Wye's chair buckled and he came down with a splintering crash;
Casson galloped madly about, pretending his chair had become unmanageable. 
It, also, ultimately collapsed, landed him flat on his back, whence
he surveyed the exercises of the <em>haute ecole</em> in which
three flushed and laughing young girls followed the dashing lead
of Cortlandt, while Berkley played a cavalry canter on the piano
with one hand and waved his cigar in the other.</p>

<p>Later, breathless, they touched glasses to the departing volunteers,
to each other, to the ladies ("God bless them! Hear! He-ah!"),
to the war, to every regiment going, to each separate battery
horse and mule in Arthur's section.  And then began on the guns,</p>

<p>"I prophesy a quick reunion!" said Berkley.  "Here's to it! 
Full glasses!</p>

<p>"Speech!  Speech&mdash;you nimble-witted, limber-legged prophet!"
roared John Casson, throwing a pack of cards at Berkley.  "Read
the cards for us!"</p>

<p>Berkley very gracefully caught a handful, and sorting them, began
impromptu:</p>

<p>  "Diamonds for <em>you</em>,   Little Miss Carew,   Strung in
a row,   Tied in a bow-  What would you do   If they came true?</p>

<p>  "What can it be?   <em>Hearts</em>! for Miss Letty-  Sweethearts
and beaux,   Monarchs in rows,   Knaves on their knees-  Choose
among these!</p>

<p>  "Clubs now, I see!   <em>Ace</em>! for Miss Betty-  Clubman
and swell,   Soldier as well.   Yes, he's all three;   Who can
he be?</p>

<p>  "Ione, be kind   To monarch and knave,   But make up your mind  
To make 'em behave.   And when a man finds <em>you</em>   The
nicest he's met, he   Is likely to marry you,   Letty and Betty!"</p>

<p>Tremendous cheering greeted these sentiments; three more cheers
were proposed and given for the Canterbury.</p>

<p>"Home of the 'ster arts, m-music an' 'r' drama-r-r&mdash;" observed
Casson hazily&mdash;"I'm going home."</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to hear him.</p>

<p>"Home&mdash;ser-weet home," he repeated sentimentally&mdash;"home among
the horses&mdash;where some Roman-nosed, camel-backed, slant-eared
nag is probably waitin' to kick daylight out'r me!  Ladies, farewell!"
he added, tripping up on his spurs and waving his hand vaguely.
"Cav'lry's eyes 'n' ears 'f army!  'Tain't the hind legs' No&mdash;<em>no</em>!
<em>I'm</em> head 'n' ears&mdash;army! 'n' I wan' t' go home."</p>

<p>For a while he remained slanting against the piano, thoughtfully
attempting to pry out the strings; then Wye returned from putting
Miss Carew and Miss Trent into a carriage.</p>

<p>"You come to the fort with me," he said.  "That'll sober you. 
I sleep near the magazine."</p>

<p>Berkley's face looked dreadfully battered and white, but he was
master of himself, careful of his equilibrium, and very polite
to everybody.</p>

<p>"You're&mdash;hic!&mdash;killin' yourself," said Cortlandt, balancing himself
carefully in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Don't put it that way," protested Berkley.  "I'm trying to make
fast time, that's all.  I'm in a hurry."</p>

<p>The other wagged his head: "<em>You</em> won't last long if you
keep this up.  The&mdash;hic!&mdash;trouble with you is that you can't get
decently drunk.  You just turn blue and white.  That's what's&mdash;matter&mdash;<em>you</em>! 
And it kills the kind of&mdash;hic!&mdash;of man you are.  B-b'lieve me,"
he added shedding tears, "I'm fon' 'v' you, Ber&mdash;hic!&mdash;kley."</p>

<p>He shed a few more scalding tears, waved his hand in resignation,
bowed his head, caught sight of his own feet, regarded them with
surprise.</p>

<p>"Whose?" he inquired naively.</p>

<p>"Yours," said Berkley reassuringly.  "They don't want to go to
bed."</p>

<p>"Put 'em to bed!" said Cortlandt in a stem voice.  "No business
wand'ring 'round here this time of night!"</p>

<p>So Berkley escorted Cortlandt to bed, bowed him politely into
his room, and turned out the gas as a precaution.</p>

<p>Returning, he noticed the straggling retreat of cavalry and artillery,
arms fondly interlaced; then, wandering back to the other room
in search of his hat, he became aware of Letty Lynden, seated
at the table.</p>

<p>Her slim, childish body lay partly across the table, her cheek
was pillowed on one outstretched arm, the fingers of which lay
loosely around the slender crystal stem of a wine-glass.</p>

<p>"Are you asleep?" he asked.  And saw that she was.</p>

<p>So he roamed about, hunting for something or other&mdash;he forgot
what&mdash;until he found it was her mantilla.  Having found it, he
forgot what he wanted it for and, wrapping it around his shoulders,
sat down on the sofa, very silent, very white, but physically
master of the demoralisation that sharpened the shadows under
his cheek-bones and eyes.</p>

<p>"I guess," he said gravely to himself, "that I'd better become
a gambler.  It's&mdash;a&mdash;very, ve&mdash;ry good 'fession&mdash;no," he added
cautiously, "<em>per</em>&mdash;fession&mdash;" and stopped short, vexed
with his difficulties of enunciation.</p>

<p>He tried several polysyllables; they went better.  Then he became
aware of the mantilla on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Some time or other," he said to himself with precision, "that
little dancer girl ought to go home."</p>

<p>He rose steadily, walked to the table:</p>

<p>"Listen to me, you funny little thing," he said.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>The childlike curve of the cheek was flushed; the velvet-fringed
lids lay close.  For a moment he listened to the quiet breathing,
then touched her arm lightly.</p>

<p>The girl stirred, lifted her head, straightened up, withdrawing
her fingers from the wine-glass.</p>

<p>"Everybody's gone home," he said.  "Do you want to stay here
all night?"</p>

<p>She rose, rubbing her eyes with the backs of her hands, saw the
mantilla he was holding, suffered him to drop it on, her shoulders,
standing there sleepy and acquiescent.  Then she yawned.</p>

<p>"Are you going with me, Mr. Berkley?"</p>

<p>"I'll&mdash;yes.  I'll see you safe."</p>

<p>She yawned again, laid a small hand on his arm, and together
they descended the stairs, opened the front door, and went out
into Twenty-third Street.  He scarcely expected to find a hack
at that hour, but there was one; and it drove them to her lodgings
on Fourth Avenue, near Thirteenth Street.  Spite of her paint
and powder she seemed very young and very tired as she stood by
the open door, looking drearily at the gray pallor over the roofs
opposite, where day was breaking.</p>

<p>"Will you&mdash;come in?"</p>

<p>He had prepared to take his leave; he hesitated.</p>

<p>"I think I will," he said.  "I'd like to see you with your face
washed."</p>

<p>Her room was small, very plain, very neat.  On the bed lay folded
a white night gown; a pair of knitted pink slippers stood close
together on the floor beside it.  There was a cheap curtain across
the alcove; she drew it, turned, looked at him; and slowly her
oval face crimsoned.</p>

<p>"You needn't wash your face," he said very gently.</p>

<p>She crept into the depths of a big arm-chair and lay back watching
him with inscrutable eyes.</p>

<p>He did not disturb her for a while.  After a few moments he got
up and walked slowly about, examining the few inexpensive ornaments
on wall and mantel; turned over the pages of an album, glanced
at a newspaper beside it, then came back and stood beside her
chair.</p>

<p>"Letty?"</p>

<p>She opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"I suppose that this isn't the&mdash;first time."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It's not far from it, though."  She was silent, but her eyes
dropped.</p>

<p>He sat down on the padded arm of the chair.</p>

<p>"Do you know how much money I've made this week?" he said gaily.</p>

<p>She looked up at him, surprised, and shook her head; but her
velvet eyes grew wide when he told her.</p>

<p>"I won it fairly," he said.  "And I'm going to stake it all on
one last bet."</p>

<p>[: "I won it fairly, and I'm going to stake it all
on one last bet."]</p>

<p>"On&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"On&mdash;<em>you</em>.  Now, <em>what</em> do you think of that,
you funny little thing?"</p>

<p>"How&mdash;do you mean, Mr. Berkley?"  He looked down into the eyes
of a hurt child.</p>

<p>"It goes into the bank in your name&mdash;if you say so."</p>

<p>"For&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said serenely, "but I am betting it will go
for rent, and board, and things a girl needs&mdash;<em>when she has
no man to ask them of&mdash;and nothing to pay for them</em>."</p>

<p>"You mean no man&#11834;excepting&mdash;you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said wearily, "I'm not trying to buy you."</p>

<p>She crimsoned.  "I thought&mdash;then why do you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Why?  Good God, child!  <em>I</em> don't know!  How do I know
why I do anything?  I've enough left for my journey.  Take this
and try to behave yourself if you can&mdash;in the Canterbury and out
of it! . . . And buy a new lock for that door of yours.  Good
night."</p>

<p>She sprang up and laid a detaining hand on his sleeve as he reached
the hallway.</p>

<p>"Mr. Berkley! I &mdash;I can't&#11834;"</p>

<p>He said, smiling: "My manners are really better than that&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You ought to.  Don't let any man take his leave in such a manner.
Men believe a woman to be what she thinks she is.  Think well
of yourself.  And go to bed.  I never saw such a sleepy youngster
in my life!  Good night, you funny, sleepy little thing."</p>

<p>"Mr. Berkley &mdash;I can't take&mdash;accept&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, listen to her!" he said, disgusted.  "Can't I make a bet
with my own money if I want to?  I <em>am</em> betting; and <em>you</em>
are holding the stakes.  It depends on how you use them whether
I win or lose."</p>

<p>"I don't understand &mdash;I don't, truly," she stammered; "d-do
you wish me to&mdash;leave&mdash;the Canterbury?  Do you&mdash;<em>what</em>
is it you wish?"</p>

<p>"You know better than I do.  I'm not advising you.  Where is
your home?  Why don't you go there?  You have one somewhere, I
suppose, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes; I had."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;where is it?"</p>

<p>"In Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you stand it?" he inquired with a sneer.</p>

<p>"No."  She covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"Trouble?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes."</p>

<p>"Man?"</p>

<p>"Y-y-yes."</p>

<p>"Won't they take you back?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>haven't written."</p>

<p>"Write.  Home is no stupider than the Canterbury.  Will you write?"</p>

<p>She nodded, hiding her face.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;<em>that's</em> settled.  Meanwhile&mdash;" he took both her
wrists and drew away her clinging hands:</p>

<p>"I'd rather like to win this bet because&mdash;the odds are all against
me."  He smiled, letting her hands swing back and hang inert at
her sides.</p>

<p>But she only closed her eyes and shook her head, standing there,
slim and tear-stained in her ruffled, wine-stained dinner dress.
And, watching her, he retreated, one step after another, slowly;
and slowly closed the door, and went out into the dawn, weary,
haggard, the taste of life bitter in his mouth.</p>

<p>"What a spectacle," he sneered, referring to himself, "the vicious
god from the machine!  Chorus of seraphim.  Apotheosis of little
Miss Turveydrop&#11834;"</p>

<p>He swayed a trine as he walked, but it was not from the wine.</p>

<p>A policeman eyed him unfavourably,</p>

<p>"No," said Berkley, "I'm not drunk.  You think I am.  But I'm
not. And I'm too tired to tell you how I left my happy, happy
home."</p>

<p>In the rosy gray of the dawn he sat down on the steps of his
new lodgings and gazed quietly into space.</p>

<p>"<em>This</em> isn't going to help," he said.  "I can stand years
of it yet.  And that's much too long."</p>

<p>He brooded for a few moments.</p>

<p>"I hope she doesn't write me again.  I can't stand everything."</p>

<p>He got up with an ugly, oblique glance at the reddening sky.</p>

<p>"I'm what he's made me&mdash;and I've got to let her alone. . . . 
Let her alone.  <em>I&mdash;" </em>He halted, laid his hand heavily
on the door, standing so, motionless.</p>

<p>"If <em>I&mdash;</em>go&mdash;near her, he'll tell her what I am.  If he
didn't, I'd have to tell her.  There's no way&mdash;anywhere&mdash;for me. 
And <em>he</em> made me so. . . .  And&mdash;by God! it's in me&mdash;in
me&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;if she writes again&mdash;" He straightened up, turned
the key calmly, and let himself in.</p>

<p>Burgess was asleep, but Berkley went into his room and awoke
him, shining a candle in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Burgess!"</p>

<p>"S-sir?"</p>

<p>"Suppose you knew you could never marry a woman.  Would you keep
away from her?  Or would you do as much as you could to break
her heart first?"</p>

<p>Burgess yawned: "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You'd do all you could?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>There was a long silence; then Berkley laughed.  "They drowned
the wrong pup," he said pleasantly.  "Good night."</p>

<p>But Burgess was already asleep again.</p>
