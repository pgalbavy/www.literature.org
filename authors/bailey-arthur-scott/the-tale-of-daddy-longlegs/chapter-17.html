<p>WHEN Daddy Longlegs went to call on Rusty Wren he did not know that a
whole army had planned to capture him. But it was true, nevertheless,
that a plot had been hatched against him. Now, right beneath the big old
cherry tree where Rusty had his home there lived a colony of ants. And
it was Rusty's habit--and his wife's, as well--to enjoy an occasional
meal (or a light luncheon) by capturing and eating such ants as were not
spry enough to keep out of harm's way.
</p>
<p>Such actions only served to make the Wren family heartily disliked by
every member of the ant colony. But there was nothing the ants could do
except to try to be careful. And they were so angry that since they were
powerless to harm the Wrens, they were quite ready and eager to vent
their spite on Rusty's smaller friends.
</p><p>That was the reason why they had determined to attack Daddy Longlegs at
the very first opportunity.
</p><p>Yes! The members of the ant colony had made up their minds to capture
Daddy the next time he should visit Rusty Wren. And the ant army of
fierce fighters was all prepared for a terrible battle. Each day
sentinels took their posts and stayed on watch, ready to give the alarm
the moment Daddy Longlegs came hobbling through the grass near the foot
of the cherry tree.
</p><p>And when, at last, Daddy fell into the trap, on the day that he visited
Rusty to boast about his wagon ride, the news of his arrival spread like
wildfire.
</p><p>The ants had not said a word to Daddy as he passed their home and
climbed up the cherry tree. They allowed him to go unharmed. But while
he was high up in the tree chatting with Rusty Wren, ants hurried back
to their stronghold from every direction. And in a surprisingly short
time the whole army was ready and waiting--waiting for Daddy Longlegs to
descend to the ground.
</p><p>When he had finished his call, Daddy Longlegs left the cherry tree and
started homeward. But he had not gone more than a few inches when the
ant army sprang out of the ground as if by magic.
</p><p>The soldiers were all around Daddy before he realized what was
happening. And then he saw that it was too late for him to turn back
and try to escape by climbing the tree again.
</p><p>Being a timid person, he took fright at once. And looking up toward
Rusty Wren's house he cried, "Help! help!" in a terror-stricken voice.
</p><p>But Daddy's shrieks brought no answer. Rusty Wren had flown away to find
food for his hungry children. The ant sentinels had seen him leave. And
they knew that they had nothing to fear from that quarter.
</p><p>As the army closed in around him, Daddy Longlegs thought that he had
never been in such danger in all his life before. The army was so near
him that he could have seen the whites of the soldier's eyes--if they
had had any whites.
