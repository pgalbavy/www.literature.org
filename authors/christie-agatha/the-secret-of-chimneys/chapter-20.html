<p>The first person that Anthony saw as he alighted from his train
on the following afternoon was Superintendent Battle. His face
broke into a smile.</p>

<p>"I’ve returned according to contract," he remarked. "Did you
come down here to assure yourself of the fact?"</p>

<p>Battle shook his head.</p>

<p>"I wasn’t worrying about that, Mr. Cade. I happen to be going
to London, that’s all."</p>

<p>"You have such a trustful nature, Battle."</p>

<p>"Do you think so, sir?"</p>

<p>"No. I think you’re deep—very deep. Still waters, you know, and
all that sort of thing. So you’re going to London?"</p>

<p>"I am, Mr. Cade."</p>

<p>"I wonder why."</p>

<p>The detective did not reply.</p>

<p>"You’re so chatty." remarked Anthony. "That’s what I like about
you."</p>

<p>A far-off twinkle showed in Battle’s eyes.</p>

<p>"What about your own little job, Mr. Cade?" he inquired. "How
did that go off?"</p>

<p>"I’ve drawn blank, Battle. For the second time I’ve been proved
hopelessly wrong. Galling, isn’t it?"</p>

<p>"What was the idea, sir, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"I suspected the French governess, Battle. A: Upon the grounds
of her being the most unlikely person, according to the canons
of the best fiction. B: Because there was a light in her room
on the night of the tragedy."</p>

<p>"That wasn’t much to go upon."</p>

<p>"You are quite right. It was not. But I discovered that she had
only been here a short time, and I also found a suspicious Frenchman
spying round the place. You know all about him, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"You mean the man who calls himself M. Chelles? Staying at the
<em>Cricketers</em>? A traveller in silk."</p>

<p>"That’s it, is it? What about him? What does Scotland Yard think?"</p>

<p>"His actions have been suspicious," said Superintendent Battle
expressionlessly.</p>

<p>"Very suspicious, I should say. Well, I put two and two together.
French governess in the house, French stranger outside. I decided
that they were in league together, and I hurried off to interview
the lady with whom Mademoiselle Brun had lived for the last ten
years. I was fully prepared to find that she had never heard of
any such person as Mademoiselle Brun, but I was wrong, Battle.
Mademoiselle is the genuine article."</p>

<p>Battle nodded.</p>

<p>"I must admit," said Anthony, "that as soon as I spoke to her
I had an uneasy conviction that I was barking up the wrong tree.
She seemed so absolutely the governess."</p>

<p>Again Battle nodded.</p>

<p>"All the same, Mr. Cade, you can’t always go by that. Women especially
can do a lot with make up. I’ve seen quite a pretty girl with
the color of her hair altered, a sallow complexion stain, slightly
reddened eyelids and, most efficacious of all, dowdy clothes,
who would fail to be identified by nine people out of ten who
had seen her in her former character. Men haven’t got quite the
same pull. You can do something with the eyebrows, and of course
different sets of false teeth alter the whole expression. But
there are always the ears—there’s an extraordinary lot of character
in ears, Mr. Cade."</p>

<p>"Don’t look so hard at mine, Battle," complained Anthony. "You
make me quite nervous."</p>

<p>"I’m not talking of false beard and grease paint," continued
the superintendent. "That’s only for books. No, there are very
few men who can escape identification and put it over on you.
In fact there’s only one man I know who has a positive genius
for impersonation. King Victor. Ever heard of King Victor, Mr.
Cade?"</p>

<p>There was something so sharp and sudden about the way the detective
put the question that Anthony half checked the words that were
rising to his lips.</p>

<p>"King Victor?" he said reflectively instead. "Somehow, I seem
to have heard the name."</p>

<p>"One of the most celebrated jewel thieves in the world. Irish
father, French mother. Can speak five languages at least. He’s
been serving a sentence, but his time was up a few months ago."</p>

<p>"Really? And where is he supposed to be now?"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Cade, that’s what we’d rather like to know."</p>

<p>"The plot thickens," said Anthony lightly. "No chance of his
turning up here, is there? But I suppose he wouldn’t be interested
in political Memoirs—only in jewels."</p>

<p>"There’s no saying," said Superintendent Battle. "For all we
know, he may be here already."</p>

<p>"Disguised as the second footman? Splendid. You’ll recognize
him by his ears and cover yourself with glory."</p>

<p>"Quite fond of your little joke, aren’t you, Mr. Cade? By the
way, what do you think of that curious business at Staines?"</p>

<p>"Staines?" said Anthony. "What’s been happening at Staines?"</p>

<p>"It was in Saturday’s papers. I thought you might have seen about
it. Man found by the roadside shot. A foreigner. It was in the
papers again to-day, of course."</p>

<p>"I did see something about it," said Anthony carelessly. "Not
suicide, apparently."</p>

<p>"No. There was no weapon. As yet the man hasn’t been identified."</p>

<p>"You seem very interested," said Anthony, smiling. "No connection
with Prince Michael’s death, is there?"</p>

<p>His hand was quite steady. So were his eyes. Was it his fancy
that Superintendent Battle was looking at him with peculiar intentness?</p>

<p>"Seems to be quite an epidemic of that sort of thing," said Battle.
"But, well, I dare say there’s nothing in it."</p>

<p>He turned away, beckoning to a porter as the London train came
thundering in. Anthony drew a faint sigh of relief.</p>

<p>He strolled across the park in an unusually thoughtful mood.
He purposely chose to approach the house from the same direction
as that from which he had come on the fateful Thursday night,
and as he drew near to it he looked up at the windows cudgelling
his brains to make sure of the one where he had seen the light.
Was he quite sure that it was the second from the end?</p>

<p>And, doing so, he made a discovery. There was an angle at the
corner of the house in which was a window set farther back. Standing
on one spot, you counted this window as the first, and the first
one built out over the Council Chamber as the second, but move
a few yards to the right and the part built out over the Council
Chamber appeared to be the end of the house. The first window
was invisible, and the two windows of the rooms over the Council
Chamber would have appeared the first and second from the end.
Where exactly had he been standing when he had seen the light
flash up?</p>

<p>Anthony found the question very hard to determine. A matter of
a yard or so made all the difference. But one point was made abundantly
clear. It was quite possible that he had been mistaken in describing
the light as occurring in the second room from the end. It might
equally well have been the <em>third</em>.</p>

<p>Now who occupied the third room? Anthony was determined to find
that out as soon as possible. Fortune favoured him. In the hall
Tredwell had just set the massive silver urn in its place on the
tea tray. Nobody else was there.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Tredwell," said Anthony. "I wanted to ask you something.
Who has the third room from the end on the West side? Over the
Council Chamber, I mean."</p>

<p>Tredwell reflected for a minute or two.</p>

<p>"That would be the American gentleman’s room, sir. Mr. Fish."</p>

<p>"Oh, is it? Thank you."</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir."</p>

<p>Tredwell prepared to depart, then paused. The desire to be the
first to impart news makes even pontifical butlers human.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have heard, sir, of what occurred last night?"</p>

<p>"Not a word," said Anthony. "What did occur last night?"</p>

<p>"An attempt at robbery, sir!"</p>

<p>"Not really? Was anything taken?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. The thieves were dismantling the suits of armour in
the Council Chamber when they were surprised and forced to flee.
Unfortunately they got clear away."</p>

<p>"That’s very extraordinary," said Anthony. "The Council Chamber
again. Did they break in that way?"</p>

<p>"It is supposed, sir, that they forced the window."</p>

<p>Satisfied with the interest his information had aroused Tredwell
resumed his retreat, but brought up short with a dignified apology.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir. I didn’t hear you come in, and I didn’t
know you were standing just behind me."</p>

<p>Mr. Isaacstein who had been the victim of the impact waved his
hand in a friendly fashion.</p>

<p>"No harm done, my good fellow. I assure you no harm done."</p>

<p>Tredwell retired looking contemptuous, and Isaacstein came forward
and dropped into an easy-chair.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Cade, so you’re back again. Been hearing all about last
night’s little show?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Anthony. "Rather an exciting week-end, isn’t it?"</p>

<p>"I should imagine that last night was the work of local men,"
said Isaacstein. "It seems a clumsy, amateurish affair."</p>

<p>"Is there anyone about here who collects armour?" asked Anthony.
"It seems a curious thing to select."</p>

<p>"Very curious," agreed Mr. Isaacstein. He paused a minute, and
then said slowly: "The whole position here is very unfortunate."</p>

<p>There was something almost menacing in his tone.</p>

<p>"I don’t quite understand," said Anthony.</p>

<p>"Why are we all being kept here in this way? The inquest was
over yesterday. The Prince’s body will be removed to London where
it is being given out that he died of heart failure. And still
nobody is allowed to leave the house. Mr. Lomax knows no more
than I do. He refers me to Superintendent Battle."</p>

<p>"Superintendent Battle has something up his sleeve," said Anthony
thoughtfully. "And it seems the essence of his plan that nobody
should leave."</p>

<p>"But, excuse me, Mr. Cade, you have been away."</p>

<p>"With a string tied to my leg. I’ve no doubt that I was shadowed
the whole time. I shouldn’t have been given a chance of disposing
of the revolver or anything of that kind."</p>

<p>"Ah, the revolver," said Isaacstein thoughtfully. "That has not
yet been found, I think?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"Possibly thrown into the lake in passing."</p>

<p>"Very possibly."</p>

<p>"Where is Superintendent Battle? I have not seen him this afternoon."</p>

<p>"He’s gone to London. I met him at the station."</p>

<p>"Gone to London? Really? Did he say when he would be back?"</p>

<p>"Early to-morrow, so I understood."</p>

<p>Virginia came in with Lord Caterham and Mr. Fish. She smiled
a welcome at Anthony.</p>

<p>"So you’re back, Mr. Cade. Have you heard all about our adventures
last night?"</p>

<p>"Why, trooly, Mr. Cade," said Hiram Fish. "It was a night of
strenuous excitement. Did you hear that I mistook Mrs. Revel for
one of the thugs?"</p>

<p>"And in the meantime," said Anthony, "the thug——?"</p>

<p>"Got clear away," said Mr. Fish mournfully.</p>

<p>"Do pour out," said Lord Caterham to Virginia. "I don’t know
where Bundle is."</p>

<p>Virginia officiated. Then she came and sat down near Anthony.</p>

<p>"Come to the boat-house after tea," she said in a low voice.
"Bill and I have got a lot to tell you."</p>

<p>Then she joined lightly in the general conversation.</p>

<p>The meeting at the boat-house was duly held.</p>

<p>Virginia and Bill were bubbling over with their news. They agreed
that a boat in the middle of the lake was the only safe place
for confidential conversation. Having paddled out a sufficient
distance, the full story of last night’s adventure was related
to Anthony. Bill looked a little sulky. He wished Virginia would
not insist on bringing this Colonial fellow into it.</p>

<p>"It’s very odd," said Anthony, when the story was finished. "What
do you make of it?" he asked Virginia.</p>

<p>"I think they were looking for something," she returned promptly.
"The burglar idea is absurd."</p>

<p>"They thought the something, whatever it was, might be concealed
in the suits of armour, that’s clear enough. But why tap the panelling?
That looks more as though they were looking for a secret staircase,
or something of that kind."</p>

<p>"There’s a Priest’s Hole at Chimneys, I know," said Virginia.
"And I believe there’s a secret staircase as well. Lord Caterham
would tell us all about it. What I want to know is, what can they
have been looking for?"</p>

<p>"It can’t be the Memoirs," said Anthony. "They’re a great bulky
package. It must have been something small."</p>

<p>"George knows, I expect," said Virginia. "I wonder whether I
could get it out of him. All along I’ve felt there was something
behind all this."</p>

<p>"You say there was only one man," pursued Anthony, "but that
there might possibly be another, as you thought you heard some
one going towards the door as you sprang to the window."</p>

<p>"The sound was very slight," said Virginia. "It might have been
just my imagination."</p>

<p>"That’s quite possible, but in case it wasn’t your imagination
the second person must have been an inmate of the house. I wonder
now——"</p>

<p>"What are you wondering at?" asked Virginia.</p>

<p>"The thoroughness of Mr. Hiram Fish who dresses himself completely
when he hears screams for help downstairs."</p>

<p>"There’s something in that," agreed Virginia. "And then there’s
Isaacstein who sleeps through it all. That’s suspicious too. Surely
he couldn’t?"</p>

<p>"There’s that fellow Boris," suggested Bill. "He looks an unmitigated
ruffian. Michael’s servant, I mean."</p>

<p>"Chimneys is full of suspicious characters," said Virginia. "I
dare say the others are just as suspicious of us. I wish Superintendent
Battle hadn’t gone to London. I think it’s rather stupid of him.
By the way, Mr. Cade, I’ve seen that peculiar-looking Frenchman
about once or twice, spying round the park."</p>

<p>"It’s a mix up," confessed Anthony. "I’ve been away on a wild-goose
chase. Made a thorough ass of myself. Look here, to me the whole
question seems to resolve itself into this: Did the men find what
they were looking for last night?"</p>

<p>"Supposing they didn’t?" said Virginia. "I’m pretty sure they
didn’t, as a matter of fact."</p>

<p>"Just this, I believe they’ll come again. They know, or they
soon will know, that Battle’s in London. They’ll take the risk
and come again to-night."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?"</p>

<p>"It’s a chance. Now we three will form a little syndicate. Eversleigh
and I will conceal ourselves with due precautions in the Council
Chamber——"</p>

<p>"What about me?" interrupted Virginia. "Don’t think you’re going
to leave me out of it."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Virginia," said Bill. "This is man’s work——"</p>

<p>"Don’t be an idiot, Bill. I’m in on this. Don’t you make any
mistake about it. The syndicate will keep watch to-night."</p>

<p>It was settled thus, and the details of the plan were laid. After
the party had retired to bed, first one and then another of the
syndicate crept down. They were all armed with powerful electric
torches, and in the pocket of Anthony’s coat lay a revolver.</p>

<p>Anthony had said that he believed another attempt to resume the
search would be made. Nevertheless, he did not expect that the
attempt would be made from outside. He believed that Virginia
had been correct in her guess that some one had passed her in
the dark the night before, and as he stood in the shadow of an
old oak dresser it was towards the door and not the window that
his eyes were directed. Virginia was crouching behind a figure
in armour on the opposite wall, and Bill was by the window.</p>

<p>The minutes passed, at interminable length. One o’clock chimed,
then the half-hour, then two, then another half-hour. Anthony
felt stiff and cramped. He was coming slowly to the conclusion
that he had been wrong. No attempt would be made to-night.</p>

<p>And then he stiffened suddenly, all his senses on the alert.
He had heard a footstep on the terrace outside. Silence again,
then a low scratching noise at the window. Suddenly it ceased,
and the window swung open. A man stepped across the sill into
the room.</p>

<p>He stood quite still for a moment, peering round as though listening.
After a minute or two, seemingly satisfied, he switched on a torch
he carried, and turned it rapidly round the room. Apparently he
saw nothing unusual. The three watchers held their breath.</p>

<p>He went over to the same bit of panelled wall he had been examining
the night before.</p>

<p>And then a terrible knowledge smote Bill. He was going to sneeze!
The wild race through the dew-laden park the night before had
given him a chill. All day he had sneezed intermittently. A sneeze
was due now, and nothing on earth would stop it.</p>

<p>He adopted all the remedies he could think of. He pressed his
upper lip, swallowed hard, threw back his head and looked at the
ceiling. As a last resort he held his nose, and pinched it violently.
It was of no avail. He sneezed.</p>

<p>A stifled, checked, emasculated sneeze, but a startling sound
in the deadly quiet of the room.</p>

<p>The stranger sprang round, and in the same minute Anthony acted.
He flashed on his torch, and jumped full for the stranger. In
another minute they were down on the floor together.</p>

<p>"Lights," shouted Anthony.</p>

<p>Virginia was ready at the switch. The lights came on true and
full to-night. Anthony was on top of his man, Bill leant down
to give him a hand.</p>

<p>"And now," said Anthony, "let’s see who you are, my fine fellow."</p>

<p>He rolled his victim over. It was the neat, dark-bearded stranger
from the <em>Cricketers</em>.</p>

<p>"Very nice indeed," said an approving voice.</p>

<p>They all looked up startled. The bulky form of Superintendent
Battle was standing in the open doorway.</p>

<p>"I thought you were in London, Superintendent Battle," said Anthony.</p>

<p>Battle’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"Did you, sir?" he said. "Well, I thought it would be a good
thing if I was thought to be going."</p>

<p>"And it has been," agreed Anthony, looking down at his prostrate
foe.</p>

<p>To his surprise there was a slight smile on the stranger’s face.</p>

<p>"May I get up, gentlemen?" he inquired. "You are three to one."</p>

<p>Anthony kindly hauled him on to his legs. The stranger settled
his coat, pulled up his collar, and directed a keen look at Battle.</p>

<p>"I demand pardon," he said, "but do I understand that you are
a representative from Scotland Yard?"</p>

<p>"That’s right," said Battle.</p>

<p>"Then I will present to you my credentials." He smiled rather
ruefully. "I would have been wise to do so before."</p>

<p>He took some papers from his pocket and handed them to the Scotland
Yard detective. At the same time, he turned back the lapel of
his coat and showed something pinned there.</p>

<p>Battle gave an exclamation of astonishment. He looked through
the papers and handed them back with a little bow.</p>

<p>"I’m sorry you’ve been man-handled, monsieur," he said, "but
you brought it on yourself, you know."</p>

<p>He smiled, noting the astonished expression on the faces of the
other.</p>

<p>"This is a colleague we have been expecting for some time," he
said. "M. Lemoine, of the Sûreté in Paris."</p>
