<p><u>Thursday</u>, <u>July</u> 25.—The street was this day much enlivened by the
presence of the men from Little Makin; they average taller than
Butaritarians, and being on a holiday, went wreathed with yellow leaves
and gorgeous in vivid colours.  They are said to be more savage, and to
be proud of the distinction.  Indeed, it seemed to us they swaggered in
the town, like plaided Highlanders upon the streets of Inverness,
conscious of barbaric virtues.
</p>
<p>In the afternoon the summer parlour was observed to be packed with
people; others standing outside and stooping to peer under the eaves,
like children at home about a circus.  It was the Makin company,
rehearsing for the day of competition.  Karaiti sat in the front row
close to the singers, where we were summoned (I suppose in honour of
Queen Victoria) to join him.  A strong breathless heat reigned under the
iron roof, and the air was heavy with the scent of wreaths.  The singers,
with fine mats about their loins, cocoa-nut feathers set in rings upon
their fingers, and their heads crowned with yellow leaves, sat on the
floor by companies.  A varying number of soloists stood up for different
songs; and these bore the chief part in the music.  But the full force of
the companies, even when not singing, contributed continuously to the
effect, and marked the ictus of the measure, mimicking, grimacing,
casting up their heads and eyes, fluttering the feathers on their
fingers, clapping hands, or beating (loud as a kettledrum) on the left
breast; the time was exquisite, the music barbarous, but full of
conscious art.  I noted some devices constantly employed.  A sudden
change would be introduced (I think of key) with no break of the measure,
but emphasised by a sudden dramatic heightening of the voice and a
swinging, general gesticulation.  The voices of the soloists would begin
far apart in a rude discord, and gradually draw together to a unison;
which, when, they had reached, they were joined and drowned by the full
chorus.  The ordinary, hurried, barking unmelodious movement of the
voices would at times be broken and glorified by a psalm-like strain of
melody, often well constructed, or seeming so by contrast.  There was
much variety of measure, and towards the end of each piece, when the fun
became fast and furious, a recourse to this figure—
</p><p>  [Picture: Music.  It means two/four time with quaver, quaver, crotchet
</p><p>                         repeated for three bars]
</p><p>It is difficult to conceive what fire and devilry they get into these
hammering finales; all go together, voices, hands, eyes, leaves, and
fluttering finger-rings; the chorus swings to the eye, the song throbs on
the ear; the faces are convulsed with enthusiasm and effort.
</p><p>Presently the troop stood up in a body, the drums forming a half-circle
for the soloists, who were sometimes five or even more in number.  The
songs that followed were highly dramatic; though I had none to give me
any explanation, I would at times make out some shadowy but decisive
outline of a plot; and I was continually reminded of certain quarrelsome
concerted scenes in grand operas at home; just so the single voices issue
from and fall again into the general volume; just so do the performers
separate and crowd together, brandish the raised hand, and roll the eye
to heaven—or the gallery.  Already this is beyond the Thespian model; the
art of this people is already past the embryo: song, dance, drums,
quartette and solo—it is the drama full developed although still in
miniature.  Of all so-called dancing in the South Seas, that which I saw
in Butaritari stands easily the first.  The <u>hula</u>, as it may be viewed
by the speedy globe-trotter in Honolulu, is surely the most dull of man’s
inventions, and the spectator yawns under its length as at a college
lecture or a parliamentary debate.  But the Gilbert Island dance leads on
the mind; it thrills, rouses, subjugates; it has the essence of all art,
an unexplored imminent significance.  Where so many are engaged, and
where all must make (at a given moment) the same swift, elaborate, and
often arbitrary movement, the toil of rehearsal is of course extreme.
But they begin as children.  A child and a man may often be seen together
in a maniap’: the man sings and gesticulates, the child stands before him
with streaming tears and tremulously copies him in act and sound; it is
the Gilbert Island artist learning (as all artists must) his art in
sorrow.
</p><p>I may seem to praise too much; here is a passage from my wife’s diary,
which proves that I was not alone in being moved, and completes the
picture:—‘The conductor gave the cue, and all the dancers, waving their
arms, swaying their bodies, and clapping their breasts in perfect time,
opened with an introductory.  The performers remained seated, except two,
and once three, and twice a single soloist.  These stood in the group,
making a slight movement with the feet and rhythmical quiver of the body
as they sang.  There was a pause after the introductory, and then the
real business of the opera—for it was no less—began; an opera where every
singer was an accomplished actor.  The leading man, in an impassioned
ecstasy which possessed him from head to foot, seemed transfigured; once
it was as though a strong wind had swept over the stage—their arms, their
feathered fingers thrilling with an emotion that shook my nerves as well:
heads and bodies followed like a field of grain before a gust.  My blood
came hot and cold, tears pricked my eyes, my head whirled, I felt an
almost irresistible impulse to join the dancers.  One drama, I think, I
very nearly understood.  A fierce and savage old man took the solo part.
He sang of the birth of a prince, and how he was tenderly rocked in his
mother’s arms; of his boyhood, when he excelled his fellows in swimming,
climbing, and all athletic sports; of his youth, when he went out to sea
with his boat and fished; of his manhood, when he married a wife who
cradled a son of his own in her arms.  Then came the alarm of war, and a
great battle, of which for a time the issue was doubtful; but the hero
conquered, as he always does, and with a tremendous burst of the victors
the piece closed.  There were also comic pieces, which caused great
amusement.  During one, an old man behind me clutched me by the arm,
shook his finger in my face with a roguish smile, and said something with
a chuckle, which I took to be the equivalent of “O, you women, you women;
it is true of you all!”  I fear it was not complimentary.  At no time was
there the least sign of the ugly indecency of the eastern islands.  All
was poetry pure and simple.  The music itself was as complex as our own,
though constructed on an entirely different basis; once or twice I was
startled by a bit of something very like the best English sacred music,
but it was only for an instant.  At last there was a longer pause, and
this time the dancers were all on their feet.  As the drama went on, the
interest grew.  The performers appealed to each other, to the audience,
to the heaven above; they took counsel with each other, the conspirators
drew together in a knot; it was just an opera, the drums coming in at
proper intervals, the tenor, baritone, and bass all where they should
be—except that the voices were all of the same calibre.  A woman once
sang from the back row with a very fine contralto voice spoilt by being
made artificially nasal; I notice all the women affect that
unpleasantness.  At one time a boy of angelic beauty was the soloist; and
at another, a child of six or eight, doubtless an infant phenomenon being
trained, was placed in the centre.  The little fellow was desperately
frightened and embarrassed at first, but towards the close warmed up to
his work and showed much dramatic talent.  The changing expressions on
the faces of the dancers were so speaking, that it seemed a great
stupidity not to understand them.’
</p><p>Our neighbour at this performance, Karaiti, somewhat favours his
Butaritarian majesty in shape and feature, being, like him, portly,
bearded, and Oriental.  In character he seems the reverse: alert,
smiling, jovial, jocular, industrious.  At home in his own island, he
labours himself like a slave, and makes his people labour like a
slave-driver.  He takes an interest in ideas.  George the trader told him
about flying-machines.  ‘Is that true, George?’ he asked.  ‘It is in the
papers,’ replied George.  ‘Well,’ said Karaiti, ‘if that man can do it
with machinery, I can do it without’; and he designed and made a pair of
wings, strapped them on his shoulders, went to the end of a pier,
launched himself into space, and fell bulkily into the sea.  His wives
fished him out, for his wings hindered him in swimming.  ‘George,’ said
he, pausing as he went up to change, ‘George, you lie.’  He had eight
wives, for his small realm still follows ancient customs; but he showed
embarrassment when this was mentioned to my wife.  ‘Tell her I have only
brought one here,’ he said anxiously.  Altogether the Black Douglas
pleased us much; and as we heard fresh details of the king’s uneasiness,
and saw for ourselves that all the weapons in the summer parlour had been
hid, we watched with the more admiration the cause of all this anxiety
rolling on his big legs, with his big smiling face, apparently unarmed,
and certainly unattended, through the hostile town.  The Red Douglas,
pot-bellied Kuma, having perhaps heard word of the debauch, remained upon
his fief; his vassals thus came uncommanded to the feast, and swelled the
following of Karaiti.
</p><p><u>Friday</u>, <u>July</u> 26.—At night in the dark, the singers of Makin paraded
in the road before our house and sang the song of the princess.  ‘This is
the day; she was born to-day; Nei Kamaunave was born to-day—a beautiful
princess, Queen of Butaritari.’  So I was told it went in endless
iteration.  The song was of course out of season, and the performance
only a rehearsal.  But it was a serenade besides; a delicate attention to
ourselves from our new friend, Karaiti.
</p><p><u>Saturday</u>, <u>July</u> 27.—We had announced a performance of the magic
lantern to-night in church; and this brought the king to visit us.  In
honour of the Black Douglas (I suppose) his usual two guardsmen were now
increased to four; and the squad made an outlandish figure as they
straggled after him, in straw hats, kilts and jackets.  Three carried
their arms reversed, the butts over their shoulders, the muzzles menacing
the king’s plump back; the fourth had passed his weapon behind his neck,
and held it there with arms extended like a backboard.  The visit was
extraordinarily long.  The king, no longer galvanised with gin, said and
did nothing.  He sat collapsed in a chair and let a cigar go out.  It was
hot, it was sleepy, it was cruel dull; there was no resource but to spy
in the countenance of Tebureimoa for some remaining trait of <u>Mr. Corpse</u>
the butcher.  His hawk nose, crudely depressed and flattened at the
point, did truly seem to us to smell of midnight murder.  When he took
his leave, Maka bade me observe him going down the stair (or rather
ladder) from the verandah.  ‘Old man,’ said Maka.  ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘and
yet I suppose not old man.’  ‘Young man,’ returned Maka, ‘perhaps fo’ty.’
And I have heard since he is most likely younger.
</p><p>While the magic lantern was showing, I skulked without in the dark.  The
voice of Maka, excitedly explaining the Scripture slides, seemed to fill
not the church only, but the neighbourhood.  All else was silent.
Presently a distant sound of singing arose and approached; and a
procession drew near along the road, the hot clean smell of the men and
women striking in my face delightfully.  At the corner, arrested by the
voice of Maka and the lightening and darkening of the church, they
paused.  They had no mind to go nearer, that was plain.  They were Makin
people, I believe, probably staunch heathens, contemners of the
missionary and his works.  Of a sudden, however, a man broke from their
company, took to his heels, and fled into the church; next moment three
had followed him; the next it was a covey of near upon a score, all
pelting for their lives.  So the little band of the heathen paused
irresolute at the corner, and melted before the attractions of a magic
lantern, like a glacier in spring.  The more staunch vainly taunted the
deserters; three fled in a guilty silence, but still fled; and when at
length the leader found the wit or the authority to get his troop in
motion and revive the singing, it was with much diminished forces that
they passed musically on up the dark road.
</p><p>Meanwhile inside the luminous pictures brightened and faded.  I stood for
some while unobserved in the rear of the spectators, when I could hear
just in front of me a pair of lovers following the show with interest,
the male playing the part of interpreter and (like Adam) mingling
caresses with his lecture.  The wild animals, a tiger in particular, and
that old school-treat favourite, the sleeper and the mouse, were hailed
with joy; but the chief marvel and delight was in the gospel series.
Maka, in the opinion of his aggrieved wife, did not properly rise to the
occasion.  ‘What is the matter with the man?  Why can’t he talk?’ she
cried.  The matter with the man, I think, was the greatness of the
opportunity; he reeled under his good fortune; and whether he did ill or
well, the exposure of these pious ‘phantoms’ did as a matter of fact
silence in all that part of the island the voice of the scoffer.  ‘Why
then,’ the word went round, ‘why then, the Bible is true!’  And on our
return afterwards we were told the impression was yet lively, and those
who had seen might be heard telling those who had not, ‘O yes, it is all
true; these things all happened, we have seen the pictures.’  The
argument is not so childish as it seems; for I doubt if these islanders
are acquainted with any other mode of representation but photography; so
that the picture of an event (on the old melodrama principle that ‘the
camera cannot lie, Joseph,’) would appear strong proof of its occurrence.
The fact amused us the more because our slides were some of them
ludicrously silly, and one (Christ before Pilate) was received with
shouts of merriment, in which even Maka was constrained to join.
</p><p><u>Sunday</u>, <u>July</u> 28.—Karaiti came to ask for a repetition of the
‘phantoms’—this was the accepted word—and, having received a promise,
turned and left my humble roof without the shadow of a salutation.  I
felt it impolite to have the least appearance of pocketing a slight; the
times had been too difficult, and were still too doubtful; and Queen
Victoria’s son was bound to maintain the honour of his house.  Karaiti
was accordingly summoned that evening to the Ricks, where Mrs. Rick fell
foul of him in words, and Queen Victoria’s son assailed him with
indignant looks.  I was the ass with the lion’s skin; I could not roar in
the language of the Gilbert Islands; but I could stare.  Karaiti declared
he had meant no offence; apologised in a sound, hearty, gentlemanly
manner; and became at once at his ease.  He had in a dagger to examine,
and announced he would come to price it on the morrow, to-day being
Sunday; this nicety in a heathen with eight wives surprised me.  The
dagger was ‘good for killing fish,’ he said roguishly; and was supposed
to have his eye upon fish upon two legs.  It is at least odd that in
Eastern Polynesia fish was the accepted euphemism for the human
sacrifice.  Asked as to the population of his island, Karaiti called out
to his vassals who sat waiting him outside the door, and they put it at
four hundred and fifty; but (added Karaiti jovially) there will soon be
plenty more, for all the women are in the family way.  Long before we
separated I had quite forgotten his offence.  He, however, still bore it
in mind; and with a very courteous inspiration returned early on the next
day, paid us a long visit, and punctiliously said farewell when he
departed.
</p><p><u>Monday</u>, <u>July</u> 29.—The great day came round at last.  In the first
hours the night was startled by the sound of clapping hands and the chant
of Nei Kamaunava; its melancholy, slow, and somewhat menacing measures
broken at intervals by a formidable shout.  The little morsel of humanity
thus celebrated in the dark hours was observed at midday playing on the
green entirely naked, and equally unobserved and unconcerned.
</p><p>The summer parlour on its artificial islet, relieved against the
shimmering lagoon, and shimmering itself with sun and tinned iron, was
all day crowded about by eager men and women.  Within, it was boxed full
of islanders, of any age and size, and in every degree of nudity and
finery.  So close we squatted, that at one time I had a mighty handsome
woman on my knees, two little naked urchins having their feet against my
back.  There might be a dame in full attire of <u>holoku</u> and hat and
flowers; and her next neighbour might the next moment strip some little
rag of a shift from her fat shoulders and come out a monument of flesh,
painted rather than covered by the hairbreadth <u>ridi</u>.  Little ladies who
thought themselves too great to appear undraped upon so high a festival
were seen to pause outside in the bright sunshine, their miniature ridis
in their hand; a moment more and they were full-dressed and entered the
concert-room.
</p><p>At either end stood up to sing, or sat down to rest, the alternate
companies of singers; Kuma and Little Makin on the north, Butaritari and
its conjunct hamlets on the south; both groups conspicuous in barbaric
bravery.  In the midst, between these rival camps of troubadours, a bench
was placed; and here the king and queen throned it, some two or three
feet above the crowded audience on the floor—Tebureimoa as usual in his
striped pyjamas with a satchel strapped across one shoulder, doubtless
(in the island fashion) to contain his pistols; the queen in a purple
<u>holoku</u>, her abundant hair let down, a fan in her hand.  The bench was
turned facing to the strangers, a piece of well-considered civility; and
when it was the turn of Butaritari to sing, the pair must twist round on
the bench, lean their elbows on the rail, and turn to us the spectacle of
their broad backs.  The royal couple occasionally solaced themselves with
a clay pipe; and the pomp of state was further heightened by the rifles
of a picket of the guard.
</p><p>With this kingly countenance, and ourselves squatted on the ground, we
heard several songs from one side or the other.  Then royalty and its
guards withdrew, and Queen Victoria’s son and daughter-in-law were
summoned by acclamation to the vacant throne.  Our pride was perhaps a
little modified when we were joined on our high places by a certain
thriftless loafer of a white; and yet I was glad too, for the man had a
smattering of native, and could give me some idea of the subject of the
songs.  One was patriotic, and dared Tembinok’ of Apemama, the terror of
the group, to an invasion.  One mixed the planting of taro and the
harvest-home.  Some were historical, and commemorated kings and the
illustrious chances of their time, such as a bout of drinking or a war.
One, at least, was a drama of domestic interest, excellently played by
the troop from Makin.  It told the story of a man who has lost his wife,
at first bewails her loss, then seeks another: the earlier strains (or
acts) are played exclusively by men; but towards the end a woman appears,
who has just lost her husband; and I suppose the pair console each other,
for the finale seemed of happy omen.  Of some of the songs my informant
told me briefly they were ‘like about the <u>weemen</u>’; this I could have
guessed myself.  Each side (I should have said) was strengthened by one
or two women.  They were all soloists, did not very often join in the
performance, but stood disengaged at the back part of the stage, and
looked (in <u>ridi</u>, necklace, and dressed hair) for all the world like
European ballet-dancers.  When the song was anyway broad these ladies
came particularly to the front; and it was singular to see that, after
each entry, the <u>première danseuse</u> pretended to be overcome by shame, as
though led on beyond what she had meant, and her male assistants made a
feint of driving her away like one who had disgraced herself.  Similar
affectations accompany certain truly obscene dances of Samoa, where they
are very well in place.  Here it was different.  The words, perhaps, in
this free-spoken world, were gross enough to make a carter blush; and the
most suggestive feature was this feint of shame.  For such parts the
women showed some disposition; they were pert, they were neat, they were
acrobatic, they were at times really amusing, and some of them were
pretty.  But this is not the artist’s field; there is the whole width of
heaven between such capering and ogling, and the strange rhythmic
gestures, and strange, rapturous, frenzied faces with which the best of
the male dancers held us spellbound through a Gilbert Island ballet.
</p><p>Almost from the first it was apparent that the people of the city were
defeated.  I might have thought them even good, only I had the other
troop before my eyes to correct my standard, and remind me continually of
‘the little more, and how much it is.’  Perceiving themselves worsted,
the choir of Butaritari grew confused, blundered, and broke down; amid
this hubbub of unfamiliar intervals I should not myself have recognised
the slip, but the audience were quick to catch it, and to jeer.  To crown
all, the Makin company began a dance of truly superlative merit.  I know
not what it was about, I was too much absorbed to ask.  In one act a part
of the chorus, squealing in some strange falsetto, produced very much the
effect of our orchestra; in another, the dancers, leaping like
jumping-jacks, with arms extended, passed through and through each
other’s ranks with extraordinary speed, neatness, and humour.  A more
laughable effect I never saw; in any European theatre it would have
brought the house down, and the island audience roared with laughter and
applause.  This filled up the measure for the rival company, and they
forgot themselves and decency.  After each act or figure of the ballet,
the performers pause a moment standing, and the next is introduced by the
clapping of hands in triplets.  Not until the end of the whole ballet do
they sit down, which is the signal for the rivals to stand up.  But now
all rules were to be broken.  During the interval following on this great
applause, the company of Butaritari leaped suddenly to their feet and
most unhandsomely began a performance of their own.  It was strange to
see the men of Makin staring; I have seen a tenor in Europe stare with
the same blank dignity into a hissing theatre; but presently, to my
surprise, they sobered down, gave up the unsung remainder of their
ballet, resumed their seats, and suffered their ungallant adversaries to
go on and finish.  Nothing would suffice.  Again, at the first interval,
Butaritari unhandsomely cut in; Makin, irritated in turn, followed the
example; and the two companies of dancers remained permanently standing,
continuously clapping hands, and regularly cutting across each other at
each pause.  I expected blows to begin with any moment; and our position
in the midst was highly unstrategical.  But the Makin people had a better
thought; and upon a fresh interruption turned and trooped out of the
house.  We followed them, first because these were the artists, second
because they were guests and had been scurvily ill-used.  A large
population of our neighbours did the same, so that the causeway was
filled from end to end by the procession of deserters; and the Butaritari
choir was left to sing for its own pleasure in an empty house, having
gained the point and lost the audience.  It was surely fortunate that
there was no one drunk; but, drunk or sober, where else would a scene so
irritating have concluded without blows?
</p><p>The last stage and glory of this auspicious day was of our own
providing—the second and positively the last appearance of the phantoms.
All round the church, groups sat outside, in the night, where they could
see nothing; perhaps ashamed to enter, certainly finding some shadowy
pleasure in the mere proximity.  Within, about one-half of the great shed
was densely packed with people.  In the midst, on the royal dais, the
lantern luminously smoked; chance rays of light struck out the earnest
countenance of our Chinaman grinding the hand-organ; a fainter glimmer
showed off the rafters and their shadows in the hollow of the roof; the
pictures shone and vanished on the screen; and as each appeared, there
would run a hush, a whisper, a strong shuddering rustle, and a chorus of
small cries among the crowd.  There sat by me the mate of a wrecked
schooner.  ‘They would think this a strange sight in Europe or the
States,’ said he, ‘going on in a building like this, all tied with bits
of string.’
