<p>When Canby (with his hair smoothed) descended to the basement
dining room of his Madison Avenue boarding-house that evening,
his table comrades gave him an effective entrance; they rose,
waving napkins and cheering, and there were cries of "Author!
Author!" "Speech!" and "Cher maitre!"</p>

<p>The recipient of these honours bore them with an uneasiness attributed
to modesty, and making inadequate response, sat down to his soup
with no importunate appetite.</p>

<p>"Seriously, though," said a bearded man opposite, who always
broke into everything with "seriously though," or else, "all joking
aside," and had thereby gained a reputation for conservatism and
soundness&mdash;"seriously, though, it must have been a great experience
to take charge of the rehearsal of such a company as Talbot Potter's."</p>

<p>"Tell us how it felt, Canby, old boy," said another. "How does
it feel to sit up there like a king makin' everybody step around
to suit you?"</p>

<p>Other neighbors took it up.</p>

<p>"Any pretty girls in the company, Can?"</p>

<p>"How does it feel to be a great dramatist, old man?"</p>

<p>"When you goin' to hire a valet-chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"Better ask him when he's goin' to take us to rehearsal, to see
him in his glory."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, gentlemen," said the hostess deprecatingly, "Miss
Cornish is trying to speak to Mr. Canby."</p>

<p>Miss Cornish, a middle-aged lady in black lace, sat at her right,
at the head of the largest table, being the most paying of these
paying guests, by which virtue she held also the ingleside premiership
of the parlour overhead. She was reputed to walk much among gentles,
and to have a high taste in letters and the drama; for she was
chief of an essay club, had a hushing manner, and often quoted
with precision from reviews, or from such publishers' advertisements
as contained no slang; and she was a member of one of the leagues
for patronizing the theatre in moderation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Canby," said the hostess pleasantly, "Miss Cornish wishes
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>This obtained the attention of the assembly, while Canby, at
the other end of the room, sat back in his chair with the unenthusiastic
air of a man being served with papers.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Cornish."</p>

<p>Miss Cornish cleared her throat, not practically, but with culture,
as preliminary to an address. "I was saying, Mr. Canby," she began,
"that I had a suggestion to make which may not only interest you,
but certain others of us who do not enjoy equal opportunities
in some matters&mdash;as&mdash;as others of us who do. Indeed, I believe
it will interest all of us without regard to&mdash;to&mdash;to this. What
I was about to suggest was that since today you have had a very
interesting experience, not only interesting because you have
entered into a professional as well as personal friendship with
one of our foremost artists&mdash;an artist whose work is cultivated
always&mdash;but also interesting because there are some of us here
whose more practical occupations and walk in life must necessarily
withhold them from&mdash;from this. What I meant to suggest was that,
as this prevents them from&mdash;from this&mdash;would it not be a favourable
opportunity for them to&mdash;to glean some commentary upon the actual
methods of a field of art? Personally, it happens that whenever
opportunities and invitations have been&mdash;have been urged, other
duties intervened, but though, on that account never having been
actually present, I am familiar, of course, through conversation
with great artists and memoirs and&mdash;and other sources of literature&mdash;with
the procedure and etiquette of rehearsal. But others among us,
no doubt through lack of leisure, are perhaps less so than&mdash;than
this. What I wished to suggest was that, not now, but after dinner,
we all assemble quietly, in the large parlour upstairs, of which
Mrs. Reibold has kindly consented to allow us the use for the
evening, for this purpose, and that you, Mr. Canby, would then
give us an informal talk&mdash;" (She was momentarily interrupted by
a deferential murmur of "Hear! Hear!" from everybody.) "What I
meant to suggest," she resumed, smiling graciously as from a platform,
"was a sort of descriptive lecture, of course wholly informal&mdash;not
so much upon your little play itself, Mr. Canby, for I believe
we are all familiar with its subject-matter, but what would perhaps
be more improving in artistic ways would be that you give us your
impressions of this little experience of yours to-day while it
is fresh in your mind. I would suggest that you tell us, simply,
and in your own way, exactly what was the form of procedure at
rehearsal, so that those of us not so fortunate as to be already
en rapport with such matters may form a helpful and artistic idea
of&mdash;of this. I would suggest that you go into some details of
this, perhaps adding whatever anecdotes or incidents of&mdash;of&mdash;of
the day&mdash;you think would give additional value to this. I would
suggest that you tell us, for instance, how you were received
upon your arrival, who took you to the most favourable position
for observing the performance, and what was said. We should be
glad to hear also, I am sure, and artistic thoughts or&mdash;or knowledge
&mdash;Mr. Potter may have let fall in the green-room; or even
a few witticisms might not be out of place, if you should recall
these. We should all like to know, I am sure, what Mr. Potter's
method of conceiving his part was. Also, does he leave entire
freedom to his company in the creation of their own roles, or
does he aid them? Many questions, no doubt, occur to all of us.
For instance: Did Mr. Potter offer you any suggestions for changes
and alterations that might aid to develop the literary and artistic
value of the pl&mdash;"</p>

<p>The placid voice, flowing on in gentle great content of itself
(while all the boarders gallantly refrained from eating), was
checked by an interruption which united into one shattering impact
the effects of lese-majeste and of violence.</p>

<p>"Couldn't! No! No parlour! Horrib&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words mingled in the throat of the playwright, producing
an explosion somewhere between choke and bellow, as he got upon
his feet, overturning his chair and coincidentally dislodging
several articles of china and glassware. He stood among the ruins
for one moment, publicly wiping his brow with a napkin, then plunged,
murmuring, out of the room and up the stairway; and, before any
of the company had recovered speech, the front door was heard
to slam tumultuously, its reverberations being simultaneous with
the sound of footsteps running down the stoop.</p>

<p>Turning northward upon the pavement, the fugitive hurriedly passed
the two lighted windows of the dining-room; they rattled with
a concussion&mdash;the outburst of suddenly released voices beginning
what was to be a protracted wake over the remains of his reputation
as a gentleman. He fled, flinging on his overcoat as he went.
In his pockets were portions of the manuscript of his play, already
distorted since rehearsal to suit the new nobleness of "Roderick
Hanscom," and among these inky sheets was a note from Talbot Potter,
received just before dinner:</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Canby,</p>

<p>Come up to my apartments at the Pantheon after dinner and let
me see what changes you have been able to make in the second and
third acts. I should like to look at them before deciding to put
on another play I have been considering.</p>

<p>Hastily y'rs,</p>

<p>Tal't Potter.</p>
