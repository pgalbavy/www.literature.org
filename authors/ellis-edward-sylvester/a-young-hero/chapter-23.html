<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The sabbath morning dawned cool, breezy and delightful, and the
maiden twin sisters, Misses Annie and Lizzie Perkinpine, made
their preparations for driving to the village church, just as
they had been in the habit of doing for many years.</p>

<p>It required a storm of unusual violence to keep them from the
Sunday service, which was more edifying to the good souls than
any worldly entertainment could have been.</p>

<p>They were not among those whose health permits them to attend
secular amusements, but who invariably feel "indisposed" when
their spiritual duties are involved.</p>

<p>"I was afraid, sister," said Annie, "that when our silver was
stolen, the loss would weigh so heavily upon me that I would not
be able to enjoy the church service as much as usual, but I am
thankful that it made no difference with me; how was it with <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"I could not help feeling disturbed for some days," was the reply,
"for it <em>was</em> a loss indeed, but, when we have so much
to be grateful for, how wrong it is to repine&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What's that?" interrupted the other, hastening to the window
as she heard the rattle of carriage wheels; "some one is coming
here as sure as I live."</p>

<p>"The folks must have forgot that it is the Sabbath," was the
grieved remark of the other.</p>

<p>"But this is something out of the common. Heigho!"</p>

<p>This exclamation was caused by the sight of Cyrus Sutton, as
he leaped lightly out of the wagon and tied his horse, while Fred
Sheldon seemed to be tugging at something on the floor of the
vehicle, which resisted his efforts.</p>

<p>Mr. Sutton, having fastened the horse, went to the help of the
youngster, and the next moment the two approached the house bearing
a considerable burden.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" exclaimed Aunt Lizzie, throwing up her hands,
and ready to sink to the floor in her astonishment; "they have
got our silverware."</p>

<p>"You are right," added her sister, "they have the whole six pieces,
slop-jar, sugar bowl, cream pitcher&mdash;not one of the six missing.
They have them <em>all</em>; <em>now</em> we can go to church
and enjoy the sermon more than ever."</p>

<p>The massive service of solid silver quaintly fashioned and carved
by the puffy craftsmen of Amsterdam, who wrought and toiled when
sturdy old Von Tromp was pounding the British tars off Goodwin
Sands, more than two centuries ago, was carried into the house
with considerable effort and set on the dining-room table, while
for a minute or two the owners could do nothing but clasp and
unclasp their hands and utter exclamations of wonder and thankfulness
that the invaluable heirlooms had at last come back to them.</p>

<p>The detective and lad looked smilingly at the ladies, hardly
less pleased than they.</p>

<p>"Where did you find them?" asked Aunt Lizzie, addressing herself
directly to Mr. Carter, as was natural for her to do.</p>

<p>The detective pointed to the boy and said:</p>

<p>"Ask him."</p>

<p>"Why, what can Fred know about it?" inquired the lady, beaming
kindly upon the blushing lad.</p>

<p>"He knows everything, for it was not I, but he, who found them."</p>

<p>"Why, Fred, how can that be?"</p>

<p>"I found them in an old tree in the woods," replied the little
fellow, blushing to his ears. "This gentleman helped me to bring
them here, for I never could have lugged them alone."</p>

<p>"Of course you couldn't, but since you have earned the reward,
you shall have it. To-day is the holy Sabbath, and it would be
wrong, therefore, to engage in any business, but come around early
to-morrow morning and we will be ready."</p>

<p>"And I want to say," said Aunt Annie, pinching the chubby cheek
of the happy youngster, "that there isn't any one in the whole
world that we would rather give the reward to than you."</p>

<p>"And there is none that it will please me more to see receive
it," was the cordial remark of Mr. Carter, who, respecting the
scruples of the good ladies, was about to bid them good-morning,
when Aunt Lizzie, walking to the window, said:</p>

<p>"I wonder what is keeping Michael."</p>

<p>"I am afraid he will not be here to-day," said the officer.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the sisters together in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Well, to tell you the truth, he is in trouble."</p>

<p>"Why, what has Michael done."</p>

<p>"Nothing himself, but do you remember the tramp who came here
last Monday night, and, after eating at your table, stole, or
rather helped to steal, your silver service?"</p>

<p>"Of course we remember him."</p>

<p>"Well, that tramp was Michael's son Bud, who had put on false
whiskers and disguised himself so that you never suspected who
he was. Bud is a bad boy and is now in jail."</p>

<p>"What is the world coming to?" gasped Aunt Lizzie, sinking into
a chair with clasped hands, while her sister was no less shocked.
In their kindness of heart they would have been glad to lose a
large part of the precious silverware could it have been the means
of restoring the boy to honesty and innocence.</p>

<p>But that was impossible, and the sisters could only grieve over
the depravity of one whom they had trusted.</p>

<p>They asked nothing about the money that was taken with the silver,
but Mr. Carter handed more than one-half of the sum to them.</p>

<p>"Bud had spent considerable, but he gave me this; Kincade declared
that he hadn't a penny left, but I don't believe him; this will
considerably decrease your loss."</p>

<p>At this moment, there was a resounding knock on the door, and
in response to the summons to enter, Archie Jackson appeared,
very red in the face and puffing hard.</p>

<p>Bowing hastily to the ladies, he said impatiently to the officer:</p>

<p>"It seems to me you're deef."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"I've been chasing and yelling after you for half a mile, but
you either pretended you didn't hear me or maybe you didn't."</p>

<p>"I assure you, Archie, that I would have stopped on the first
call, if I had heard you, for you know how glad I am always to
have your company, and how little we could have done without your
help."</p>

<p>The detective knew how to mollify the fussy constable, whose
face flushed a still brighter red, under the compliments of his
employer, as he may be termed.</p>

<p>"I knowed you was coming here," explained Archie, "and so I come
along, so as to vouch to these ladies for you."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, but they seem to be satisfied with Master
Fred's indorsement, for he has the reputation of being a truthful
lad."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it; how far, may I ask," he continued, clearing
his throat, "have you progressed in the settlement of the various
questions and complications arising from the nefarious transaction
on Monday evening last?"</p>

<p>"The plate has been returned to the ladies, as your eyes must
have told you; but, since this is the first day of the week, the
reward will not be handed over to Fred until to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>"Accept my congratulations, sir, accept my congratulations,"
said the constable, stepping ardently toward the boy and effusively
extending his hand.</p>

<p>The ladies declined to accept the money which the detective offered,
insisting that it belonged to him. He complied with their wishes,
and, since it was evident that Archie had hastened over solely
to make sure he was not forgotten in the general distribution
of wages, the detective handed him one hundred dollars, which
was received with delight, since it was far more than the constable
had ever earned in such a short time in all his life before.</p>

<p>"Before I leave," said Mr. Carter, addressing the ladies, "I
must impress one important truth upon you."</p>

<p>"You mean about the sin of stealing," said Aunt Annie; "Oh, we
have thought a good deal about <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>The officer smiled in spite of himself, but quickly became serious
again.</p>

<p>"You mistake me. I refer to your practice of keeping such valuable
plate as loosely as you have been in the habit of doing for so
many years. The fact of the robbery will cause it to be generally
known that your silver can be had by any one who chooses to enter
your house and take it, and you may rest assured, that if you
leave it exposed it won't be long before it will vanish again,
beyond the reach of all the Fred Sheldons and detectives in the
United States."</p>

<p>"Your words are wise," said Aunt Annie, "and I have made up my
mind that we must purchase two or three more locks and put them
on the chest."</p>

<p>"I think I know a better plan than <em>that</em>," Aunt Lizzie
hastened to say.</p>

<p>"What's that?" inquired the visitor.</p>

<p>"We'll get Michael to bring some real heavy stones to the house
and place them on the lid of the chest, so as to hold it down."</p>

<p>"Neither of your plans will work," said Mr. Carter solemnly;
"you must either place your silver in the bank, where you can
get it whenever you wish, or you must buy a burglar-proof safe
and lock it up in that every night."</p>

<p>"I have heard of such things," said Aunt Lizzie, "and I think
we will procure a safe, for it is more pleasant to know that the
silver is in the house than it is to have it in the bank, miles
off, where it will be so hard to take and bring it. What do you
think, sister?"</p>

<p>"The same as you do."</p>

<p>"Then we will buy the safe."</p>

<p>"And until you do so, the silver must be deposited in the bank;
though, as this is Sunday, you will have to keep it in the house
until the morrow."</p>

<p>"I shall not feel afraid to do that," was the serene response
of sister Lizzie, "because no man, even if he is wicked enough
to be a robber, would be so abandoned as to commit the crime on
<em>Sunday</em>."</p>

<p>The beautiful faith of the good soul was not shocked by any violent
results of her trust. Though the silver remained in her house
during the rest of that day and the following night, it was not
disturbed, and on the morrow was safely delivered to the bank,
where it stayed until the huge safe was set up in the old mansion,
in which the precious stuff was deposited, and where at this writing
it still remains, undisturbed by any wicked law-breakers.</p>

<p>You may not know it, but it is a fact that there are circuses
traveling over the country to-day whose ticket-sellers receive
no wages at all, because they rely upon the short change and the
bad money which they can work off on their patrons. Not only that,
but I know of a case where a man paid twenty dollars monthly for
the privilege of selling tickets for a circus.</p>

<p>From this statement, I must except any and all enterprises with
which my old friend, P. T. Barnum, has any connection. Nothing
could induce him to countenance such dishonesty.</p>

<p>Trained in this pernicious school, Jacob Kincade did not hesitate
to launch out more boldly, and finally he formed a partnership
with two other knaves, for the purpose of circulating counterfeit
money, engaging now and then in the side speculation of burglary,
as was the case at Tottenville, where he arrived a few hours in
advance of the show itself.</p>

<p>He and his two companions were deserving of no sympathy, and
each was sentenced to ten years in the State prison.</p>

<p>The youth of Bud Heyland, his honest repentance and the grief
of his father and mother aroused great sympathy for him. It could
not be denied that he was a bad boy, who had started wrong, and
was traveling fast along the downward path. In truth, he had already
gone so far that it may be said the goal was in sight when he
was brought up with such a round turn.</p>

<p>A fact greatly in his favor was apparent to all&mdash;he had been
used as a cat's paw by others. He was ignorant of counterfeit
money, though easily persuaded to engage in the scheme of passing
it upon others. True, the proposition to rob the Perkinpine sisters
came from him, but in that sad affair also he was put forward
as the chief agent, while his partner took good care to keep in
the background.</p>

<p>Bud saw the fearful precipice on whose margin he stood. His parents
were almost heart-broken, and there could be no doubt of his anxiety
to atone, so far as possible, for the evil he had done.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the judge was not only just but merciful, and, anxious
to save the youth, he discharged him under a "suspended sentence,"
as it was called, a most unusual proceeding under the circumstances,
but which proved most beneficent, since the lad never gave any
evidence of a desire to return to his evil ways.</p>

<p>As for Master Fred Sheldon, I almost feel as though it is unnecessary
to tell you anything more about him, for, with such a mother,
with such natural inclinations, and with such training, happiness,
success and prosperity are as sure to follow as the morning is
to succeed the darkness of night.</p>

<p>I tell you, boys, you may feel inclined to slight the old saying
that honesty is the best policy, but no truer words were ever
written, and you should carry them graven on your hearts to the
last hours of your life.</p>

<p>Fred grew into a strong, sturdy boy, who held the respect and
esteem of the neighborhood. The sisters Perkinpine, as well as
many others, took a deep interest in him and gave him help in
many ways, and often when the boy was embarrassed by receiving
it.</p>

<p>The time at last came, when our "Young Hero" bade good-by to
his loved mother, and went to the great city of New York to carve
his fortune. There he was exposed to manifold more temptations
than ever could be the case in his simple country home, but he
was encased in the impenetrable armor of truthfulness, honesty,
industry and right principles, and from this armor all the darts
of the great adversary "rolled off like rustling rain."</p>

<p>Fred is now a man engaged in a prosperous business in the metropolis
of our country, married to a loving and helpful wife, who seems
to hold the sweetest and tenderest place in his affection, surpassed
by that of no one else, but equalled by her who has been his guardian
angel from infancy &mdash;<em>HIS MOTHER</em>.</p>

<p><em>THE WALNUT ROD</em>.</p>

<p>BY R. F. <em>COLWELL</em>.</p>

<p>My father was a physician of good practice in a wealthy quarter
of Philadelphia, and we boys, four in number, were encouraged
by him to live out of doors as much as possible. We played the
national game, rowed, belonged to a well-equipped private gymnasium,
and were hale and hearty accordingly; but especially did we prize
the spring vacation which was always spent at our grandfather's
farm, a beautiful spot in the Juanita valley, shut in by hills
and warmed by the sunshine, which always seemed to us to shine
especially bright on our annual visit, as if to make up for the
cloudy and stormy weather of March.</p>

<p>At the time of which I speak, the anticipations before starting
were especially joyous. Harry, Carl and Francis, aged respectively
eleven, fourteen and sixteen, had after earnest efforts in their
school work been promoted each to the class above his former rank,
and were in consequence proud and happy, though tired. I, Royal
by name, a junior in a well-known New England college, working
steadily in the course, was not unwilling to spend a week or two
in quiet, searching the well-stored library which had the best
that three generations of book lovers could buy on its shelves,
and before whose cheery open fire we gathered at evening for stories
and counsel from older and wiser minds.</p>

<p>We packed our bags, took our rods&mdash;for trout fishing was often
good, even in early April, in a well-stocked brook that ran along
willow-fringed banks in the south pasture&mdash;and boarded the train.
At the station the hired man met us with a pair of Morgan horses
than which I do not remember to have seen better from that day
to this, and we were soon at the hall door, shaking hands with
grandmother and grandfather, and, to our pleasant surprise, with
Aunt Celia, who, unexpectedly to us, was at home. She was a widow,
having lost her husband in the Mexican war, and was a teacher
of modern languages in a girl's private school in southern New
York. She was one of those rare natures that the heart instinctively
trusts, and no one of the many grandchildren hesitated about telling
Aunt Celia his or her troubles, always confident that something
would be done toward making the rough place smooth or gaining
the object sought.</p>

<p>We had a cozy tea. The special good things that only grandmothers
seem to remember that a boy likes were found beside our plates,
and we did them ample justice. This was Saturday evening. The
next morning we occupied the family pew, and raised our young
voices in the familiar hymns so clearly and joyously, that I remember
to have seen many of the older people looking in our direction,
and one old lady remarked as we were going out, "Henry's boys
take after him for their good voices." Father had led the village
choir for several years before he went away from his home to the
medical school.</p>

<p>The next morning we took our rods and went off for a long tramp.
We fished some, and between us brought home enough for next morning's
breakfast. The next day we climbed the favorite hills and gathered
four large bunches of that spring beauty <em>Epigæa repens</em>,
arbutus, or May flowers, whose pink cups and delicious woody fragrance
we entrusted to damp moss, and sent the box with our cards to
mother, for we knew how she loved the flowers she had picked from
these same hills. Their scent comes back to me now, though it
is many years since I have picked one. Carl and Francis were just
at the age when feats of daring were a delight to them. Harry
was of a naturally timid nature, modest, and lacking sometimes
in confidence, and so was often urged on by the other two, when
he shrank from attempting anything, by such expressions as "Don't
be a coward, Harry!" "A girl could do that!" which, by such a
sensitive spirit, were felt more than blows of the lash would
be. When I was by, the boys would not indulge in these trials
of strength or endurance, but in my absence I knew they hurt his
tender feelings by their taunts, though really they did not intend
to. A boy looks for what he calls courage in his playmate, and,
if he does not see what apparently corresponds to his own, he
thinks him a coward, while the braver of the two may really be
the more diffident and shrinking one.</p>

<p>It was Saturday afternoon; we were to leave Monday morning, and
I had gone to the post-office to mail a letter to our father,
telling him to expect us Monday noon. Behind the barn was a large
oak tree from whose trunk a long branch ran horizontally toward
the shed roof, though at a considerable distance above it. The
boys had been pitching quoits near the tree, and, having finished
the game, looked about for some more exciting sport. Francis thought
he saw it, so he climbed the tree, crept out on the limb, hung
by the arms a moment and then dropped, with something of a jar,
to be sure, but safely, on the roof, where he sat with a satisfied
look. He called to Carl to follow him. Carl, though unwilling
to try it, was still more unwilling to acknowledge any superiority
of his older brother in that line, so he, too, climbed up, crept
out, and, when he had found what he thought was a good place,
and had called out two or three times, "Fran, shall I strike all
right?" dropped and was happy. Then they both called to Harry,
"Come on, Hal," but he, overcome by the fear he had felt that
they would fall while attempting it, refused to make the trial.
When they began to speak about what "a girl could do," grandfather
came out of the back door, where he had been a silent spectator
of the whole affair, patted Harry on the shoulder, assuring him
that he'd more good sense than Carl and Francis together, and
bade the climbers come down at once.</p>

<p>Grandfather was a man of few words, and they obeyed. Nothing
more was said. I returned soon after. We had tea as usual and
adjourned to the library, where a genial fire of hickory logs
warmed and lighted the room. Grandmother and grandfather sat in
their armchairs on each side of the broad hearth. I occupied an
antique chair I had found in the attic, and which I was to carry
home for my own room. Carl and Francis sat on old-fashioned crickets,
while Aunt Celia had her low willow rocker in front of the fire,
and Harry leaned against her, with her arm around his neck.</p>

<p>We remained silent for some moments, when grandfather said quietly,
"Celia, hadn't you better tell the boys the story of the walnut
rod?" We looked up in swift surprise. The walnut rod spoken of
was one that had rested, ever since we could remember, across
a pair of broad antlers over the fireplace, with an old sword
and two muskets that had seen service at Bunker Hill and Yorktown.
Often had we, in boyish curiosity, asked what it was, and why
it was kept there, tied by a piece of faded ribbon to one of the
antlers, but had always been put off with "by-and-by," and "when
you are older." Now, when we saw a chance to know about it, we
chorused, "Oh, yes, Aunt Celia, do tell, please," and she quietly
saying, "I suppose they can learn its lesson now," began:</p>

<p>"I was, as you know, the only girl of the family, and also the
youngest child, your father being two years older. There were
few neighbors when we first came here to live; indeed, our nearest
was fully a quarter of a mile away, so we saw few beside our own
family. Your uncles, John, William, and Elijah, were several years
older, and so were busy helping father in clearing the land and
in its care. Accordingly, Henry and I were much together. We studied
the same book at our mother's knee, played with the same toys,
and were together so much that the older boys sometimes called
us 'mother's two girls.' But your father, though tender and gentle
in appearance, had a brave heart under his little jacket, and
I knew better than they, that he was no coward. They called him
so sometimes, thinking, because he seemed fearful about some things
they counted trifles, that he really had no courage. I'm afraid
boys have forgotten nowadays, that mere daring is no test of true
courage." Here Francis and Carl felt their faces grow hot, but
Aunt Celia said no more and went on.</p>

<p>"It was one day in April, very like to-day, that we all went
upon the side hill to pick May flowers. Henry was nearly twelve
years old&mdash;his birthday, as you know, is next month&mdash;and I was
ten. It had always been a habit, when people went out in the spring
for flowers, to cut a stout stick, to be used partly as a walking-stick,
and partly as a protection against snakes, which were often seen,
but which usually escaped before they could be reached. Old people
told of rattlesnakes that used to be seen, but they were very
scarce, even then, and none of us had ever seen one.</p>

<p>"We all had sticks, cut from a bunch of hickory saplings that
grew beside the path, and your uncle Elijah said, as we were going
along, 'I wonder what Hen would do if he heard a rattlesnake;
turn pale and faint away, I guess,' at which the others laughed
loudly, but Henry said nothing, though I saw his lips quiver at
the taunt.</p>

<p>"We found the flowers, thick and beautiful, just as you have
this week. We picked all we wished, ate the lunch which mother
had put up for us, and were sitting on a large, flat stone, talking
of starting for home. I saw a bit of pretty moss under some twigs
at the edge of the stone, and stepped down to get it, when suddenly
a peculiar whir-r-r, that we never had heard before, struck our
ears. All the boys started up, looking about eagerly. The bushes
at my side parted slightly, and the flattened head of a large
rattlesnake protruded, and again came that dreadful sound. Then
the boys jumped from the rock, each in a different direction,
and screamed, rather than cried, 'Jump, Celia, it's a rattlesnake!'</p>

<p>"I could not move. I must have been paralyzed by fear, for, though
I was but a child, I could not misunderstand my danger. Of course,
what I am telling happened in a few seconds, but I remember hearing
the swish that a stick makes when it cuts through the air, and
the horrible head, with its forked, vibrating tongue, was severed
from the writhing body, and fell at my feet.</p>

<p>"Harry had quietly stepped down by my side, and with his stick&mdash;the
one you see on the antlers yonder&mdash;had saved me from a dreadful
death. There he stood, pale and trembling to be sure, but with
such a light in his blue eyes, that none of his older brothers
dared ever call him coward, or girl, again. We walked quietly
home, bringing the body with its horrible horny scales to show
to father and mother. I shall never forget how they clasped us
in their arms as they listened to the story, and how I wondered,
as a child will, if everybody, when they were grown up, cried
when they were very glad.</p>

<p>"Nothing was ever said to the older boys. They had learned what
true bravery was, the scorn of self-protection when another needed
help, and they have been better for it ever since. Your father
has never had the story told to you, thinking that some time it
might also teach you the lesson that true courage from its root
word, the Latin <em>cor</em>, and down through the French <em>coeur</em>,
is both below and above any outward manifestations, and belongs
to the heart.</p>

<p>"The snake must have come out into the sun from his den under
the rock, and was not as active as in warmer weather, or the bite
would have followed the first alarm. There has never since been
seen another in this locality."</p>

<p>We sat in silence for awhile, and then grandfather spoke, laying
his hand on Harry's curls: "I seem to see my boy Henry again in
his son, Harry. I hope he will grow up into the same brave, though
tender manhood of his father, and remember, boys," he said, turning
toward Francis and Carl, "that recklessness and a desire to be
thought bold and daring are not an index of true courage and often
have no connection with it. If the walnut rod teaches you this
lesson, its story will be of great value to you."</p>

<p><em>HOW THE HATCHET WAS BURIED</em>.</p>

<p>BY <em>OCTAVIA CARROLL</em>.</p>

<p>A feud, as fierce as that between the Montagues and Capulets,
had for several years raged between the boys of Valleytown and
the country lads living on the breezy hills just above the small
village. Originating in a feeling of jealousy, it waxed hotter
and more bitter with every game of ball and every examination
at the "Academy" where they were forced to meet the rival factions,
tauntingly dubbing each other "Lilies of the Valley" and "Ground
Moles," while if a Lily chanced to whip a Mole in a fair fight
all the town-bred youths immediately stood on their heads for
joy, and if a Mole went above a Lily in class, the entire hill
company crowed as loudly as the chanticleers of the barnyard.
By general consent two boys had come to be considered the leaders
of the respective factions; handsome, quick-witted Roy Hastings
of the former, and stronger, bright Carl Duckworth of the latter;
while it was an annoyance to each that their sisters had struck
up a "bosom friendship" and stubbornly refused to share in their
brothers' feud.</p>

<p>"It is so absurd in Roy," said Helen Hastings, "to want me not
to visit Maizie, whom I love so dearly, just because one of her
family has beaten him at baseball and shot more pigeons this spring."</p>

<p>"And Helen shall come to tea as often as she likes to put up
with our plain fare," declared little Miss Duckworth, "even if
Carl does look like a thunder-cloud all supper time and has hardly
enough politeness to pass the butter."</p>

<p>So matters stood when, one evening in early June, the commander
of the heights' coterie summoned his followers to a meeting in
the loft of an old barn on his father's estate, that was only
used as a storehouse since a better one had been built.</p>

<p>"Hello, fellows, what is this pow-wow about?" asked agile Mark
Tripp, as he sprang up a rickety ladder and popped his head through
the square opening in the attic floor.</p>

<p>"Dun'no; some bee, Duckworth, here, has buzzing round in his
bonnet," replied lazy Hugh Blossom from the hay, where he reclined.
"It takes the captain to have 'happy thoughts,'" while, playfully
pulling a refractory lock of hair sticking out from Carl's head,
he gaily chanted:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"And the duck with the feather curled over his back,<br/>
He leads all the others, with his quack! quack! quack!"

</p>
</div>
<p>"Good enough! All right, Ducky, proceed with your quacking! Let's
know what's up! Are the 'low-ly lil-is of the val-ly' once more
on the war path? And to what do they challenge us&mdash;a spelling
match or a swimming race?"</p>

<p>"To neither. Those very superior posies are about to seek glory
in another way. I have learned from a most reliable source that
they are now hoarding all their pocket money in order to astonish
the natives. In fact, fellers, they intend to fresco Valleytown
a decided carmine on the 'Glorious Fourth,' and we have got to
make the hills hum to quench 'em."</p>

<p>"What form is their celebration to take?" asked little Peter
Wheatly.</p>

<p>"Fireworks, principally. Real stunners! Not just a few Roman
candles and sky-rockets, but flower-pots throwing up colored balls
that burst into stars, zigzagging serpents, and all sorts of things,
such as have never been seen round here before. Why, our big bonfire
and giant crackers will be nowhere."</p>

<p>"Right you are there, Cap," said Hugh. "They will have all the
country down on the Green patting them on the back for their public
spirit, while we occupy a back seat. It's a pretty bright move
for the Lilies, and I don't see how we can prevent it."</p>

<p>"Get up a counter-attraction. Pyro&mdash;pyro&mdash;what do you call 'em
will make a good deal finer show from Round Knob than down yonder
in the dale."</p>

<p>"Sure. But where are your pyrotechnics to come from?"</p>

<p>"From the city, of course. See here, I wrote to a firm there
as soon as I learned the Lilies' secret, and they sent me a price-list."
Young Duckworth produced a very gay red and yellow circular, but
the boys only looked at each other in blank amazement. The hillside
farmers were nearly all land poor, gaining but a bare subsistence
out of the rocky New England soil and seldom had a dime, much
less dollars, to squander on mere amusement.</p>

<p>"Guess you think we are Rothschilds or Vanderbilts," snickered
small Peter.</p>

<p>"Pennies always burn a hole in my pocket and drop right out,"
said Mark.</p>

<p>"I might chip in a copper cent and a nickel with a dig in it,"
drawled Hugh, and there was no one else who could do better.</p>

<p>"Well, I know you are an impecunious lot," continued Carl, "but
next week the strawberries will be dead ripe. If you fellows will
only be patriotic and pitch in and pick for the cause we can put
Roy Hastings and his top-lofty crowd to the blush by getting up
a really respectable show with a 'piece' as a topper off. I don't
believe the Valleyites ever thought of a 'piece.'"</p>

<p>"What sort of a piece?" asked Bud Perkins.</p>

<p>"Why, a fancy piece of fireworks, of course. Just listen to what
Powder &amp; Co. offer!" and Carl read aloud: "'Realistic spectacle
of Mother Goose, in peaked hat and scarlet cloak, with her gander
by her side. The head of George Washington, the Father of his
Country, surrounded by thirteen stars. Very fine. Superb figure
of Christopher Columbus landing from his Spanish galleon upon
the American shore. One of our most magnificent designs."</p>

<p>"There, don't that sound prime? They're expensive, awfully expensive,
but we can economize on the rockets and little things to come
out strong, in a blaze of glory, at the end. I warrant a Mother
Goose or, better yet, a Washington would shut up the Lilies' leaves
in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"Or Christopher Columbus &mdash;I vote for old Chris," shouted
Mark.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Chris and his galleon," chorused the others.</p>

<p>"It is the dearest of them all," remarked Carl, somewhat dubiously.</p>

<p>"No matter, 'Chris or nothing,' say we." So it was decided, and
before the boys parted they had all agreed, if they could win
their parents' consent, to hire out for the berry-picking and
to contribute every cent thus earned toward the Fourth of July
celebration.</p>

<p>There is no spur like competition, and for the next three weeks
the ambitious youths devoted themselves heart, and soul, and fingers
to the cause; but the pickers had their reward, when, the berry
harvest over, they found they could send a tolerably satisfactory
order to Powder &amp; Co., and when, on the third of July, a great
box arrived by express, was unpacked, and its contents secretly,
and under the cover of night, stored away in the lower part of
Farmer Duckworth's discarded barn, their exuberant delight burst
forth in sundry ecstatic somersaults and Indian-like dances.</p>

<p>It may be, however, that their exultation might have been tempered
with caution had they been aware of two figures gliding stealthily
through the darkness without, and known that the case, bearing
the name of the city firm, when it was taken from the train, had
not escaped the sharp eyes of Roy Hastings and his chum Ed Spafford.</p>

<p>"How do you suppose they ever raised the money to buy all those
fireworks?" asked one shadow of another shadow, as they flitted
down the hill.</p>

<p>"I don't know, confound 'em! But I do know their show is better
than ours, and something has got to be done!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, and surely, Roy, there must be some way!"</p>

<p>"There always is where there is a will, and&mdash;and&mdash;<em>matches</em>!"</p>

<p>Boom, boom, boom! Old Captain Stone's ancient cannon announced
the advent of another Independence Day shortly after midnight,
and Young America was quickly abroad with the Chinese cracker
and torpedo.</p>

<p>Helen Hastings disliked the deafening racket of the village and,
therefore, early beat a retreat to the hills, determined to enjoy
the day in her own fashion with Maizie, who welcomed her with
open arms.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you have come, Nell, dear, for I was feeling as
blue as your sash, if it is the Fourth of July!"</p>

<p>"Why, darling, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so worried because pa is worried. He don't act a bit
like his dear, jolly, old self, but goes round with a long face
and can neither eat nor sleep. Ma says it is because a mortgage
or something is coming due, and the crops have been so bad for
several years that he is afraid he may have to sell the farm and
move out West. It would just break my heart to leave this place."</p>

<p>"So it would mine. But there, Maizie, it is foolish to be troubled
about what may never happen. It is so warm let us find a nice
cool spot and finish the book we commenced the other day."</p>

<p>"There is a good current of air through the loft of the old barn.
We will go there if you can scramble up the ladder."</p>

<p>This, with some assistance, Helen succeeded in doing, and the
two girls were soon nestling in the sweet, new-mown hay.</p>

<p>"Eleven o'clock," announced Helen, consulting her little chatelaine
watch as they finally laid down the entertaining story they had
been reading, "and I am both sleepy and thirsty."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, lie back and take a nap and I will go and make
lemonade for us both."</p>

<p>"Really? Oh, that will be delicious!" and throwing herself back
on the fragrant mow she closed her eyes as her blithe, hospitable
friend skipped off toward the house.</p>

<p>The twittering of the swallows in the eaves and the hum of the
insects in the meadows without were curiously soothing, and the
fair maid fell into a light doze from which, however, she was
rudely awakened by a terrific explosion. She sprang to her feet
in alarm to find the floor heaving like the deck of a ship at
sea and feel the tumble-down building rocking as though shaken
to its very foundation.</p>

<p>"What has happened! Is it an earthquake?" she gasped, rushing
to the ladder-way; but she started back in affright at sight of
a mass of flame and flying, fiery objects below. "Oh, this is
terrible!" Was she, Helen Hastings&mdash;her father's pride, her brothers'
pet&mdash;to meet a violent death here in this lonely spot? Expecting
every instant to have the boards give way beneath her, she flew
to the window and, in her desperation, would have leaped out,
regardless of a huge pile of stones beneath, had not the voice
of Maizie at that moment reached her ear calling: "Don't jump,
Helen; don't jump! You will be killed! Wait! courage! I am going
for help." Even as she faltered hesitatingly, her strength failed,
her senses reeled and she fell fainting to the ground.</p>

<p>Across lots from Round Knob, where they had been preparing for
the evening exhibition, came Carl Duckworth, Hugh Blossom and
Bud Perkins. They were in high spirits, discussing with animation
the anticipated fun, when Bud suddenly stopped short, asking,
"Who are those fellows making tracks so fast down the road?"</p>

<p>"Looks like Roy Hastings and Ed Spafford," replied Hugh. "Though
what brings them this way on such a day as this puzzles me."</p>

<p>"I hope they haven't got wind of our plans and been up to some
mischief," said Carl, uneasily, instinctively quickening his footsteps.</p>

<p>A moment later, as they entered the farm gate, the explosion
that had awakened Helen made them also start and gaze at each
other in dismay. Then a howl of mingled rage, grief and astonishment
burst from the trio as through the open door of the old barn shot
a confused medley of rockets, pin-wheels, snakes and grasshoppers,
popping and fizzing madly in the garish sunlight; a howl that
culminated in a shriek when whirling and spinning out whizzed
the famous "piece," the Landing of Columbus, thrown by the concussion
far upon the grass, where it went off in a highly erratic manner,
poor Christopher appearing perfectly demoralized as he stood on
his head in the brilliant galleon, with his feet waving amid a
galaxy of stars.</p>

<p>"All our three weeks' labor and all our money gone up in smoke!"
groaned Bud, flinging himself down in an agony of despair.</p>

<p>"And it is Roy Hastings' mean, dastardly work," growled Hugh;
while Carl turned pale with wrath and shook his fist in a way
that boded no good to his enemy. Indeed, at that instant, he felt
that revenge, swift and telling, would be the sweetest thing in
life.</p>

<p>Truly, then, it seemed the very irony of fate, when, from amid
the wreaths of smoke pouring from the upper loft window, emerged
for a brief second a girlish, white-robed figure, with beseeching,
outstretched hands, that paused, swayed, then fell back and disappeared,
while Maizie rushed toward them crying, "Oh, Carl, Carl! The old
barn is on fire, and Helen is in there!"</p>

<p>"What! Roy Hastings' sister?" and Hugh actually laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"Serves the mean rascal right, too, if she was killed, for he
would have no one but himself to blame," said Bud Perkins, whose
bark was always worse than his bite, and who was really as kind-hearted
a chap as ever lived.</p>

<p>"Oh, you bad, cruel boys!" exclaimed Maizie; "but Carl, I know,
will not be so wicked," and she turned imploringly to her brother,
in whose mind a fierce struggle was going on. In a flash, he saw
his foe bowed and crushed with remorse, a "paying back" far beyond
anything he could have dreamed of! Besides, the risk was tremendous,
and why should he endanger his life? But the next moment humanity
triumphed, and shouting, "We can't stand idle and see a girl perish
before our eyes! So here goes," he sped off toward the burning
building, stripping off his jacket, as he ran, which he plunged
into a barrel of water and then wrapped closely about his head.
Thus protected, he bravely dashed through the flames lapping at
him with their fiery tongues. His breath came in short, quick
pants, he was nearly suffocated, and falling rafters warned him
that he had no time to spare. Valiantly, however, he struggled
to the already charred ladder and groped his way up it, until,
gasping and exhausted, he reached the window with the unconscious
girl in his arms, as the fire was eating through the floor at
his feet.</p>

<p>To the anxious watchers outside, it appeared an eternity before
the lad reached the window and deftly caught the rope they had
ready to toss to him. With trembling fingers he knotted this about
Helen's waist, gently let her down into the arms of Bud and Hugh
and then prepared to descend himself, when a groan of horror from
the onlookers rent the air; there was a quiver, a sudden giving
way, a deafening crash and roar. The flooring had at length succumbed
to the destroying element and gone down. Mrs. Duckworth sank on
her knees sobbing. "Oh, my boy! my boy!" and Maizie hid her face.
But, as the smoke cleared away, the groan changed to a joyous
shout and all looked up to behold the youth clinging to the casement,
which was still upheld by two feeble supports.</p>

<p>Hugh sprang forward. "Carl, drop! Let yourself drop," he called.
"We will catch you," and Carl, as a great darkness overwhelmed
him, dropped like a dead weight and was borne, a begrimed and
senseless burden, to his own little room in the cozy old homestead.</p>

<p>Summer was over ere a mere wraith of sturdy, lively Carl Duckworth
was able to creep down stairs to sit on the veranda and gaze listlessly
out upon the mountain landscape in its early autumn dress. But,
after weary weeks of pain and anxiety, he was on the mend, and
there was something of the old merriment in his laugh when he
caught sight of a row of urchins, perched on the fence like a
motley flock of birds, singing with hearty good will, "See, the
Conquering Hero Comes!" and he was surprised to recognize in the
welcoming choristers many "Lilies" of Valleytown, as well as his
own familiar friends.</p>

<p>It was something of an astonishment, too, to have Roy Hastings
hurry forward to offer his hand and say:</p>

<p>"I can't tell you, Duckworth, how glad I am to see you out again
and only wish you would give me a good sound kicking;" while surely
there were tears in his eyes and a curious break in his voice.</p>

<p>It was a boy's way of begging pardon, but, being a boy, Carl
understood, while as he looked into the other's white worn face,
so changed since he saw it last, he dimly comprehended that there
might be "coals of fire" which burn more sharply even than the
blisters and stings that had caused him such days and nights of
agony.</p>

<p>So the grasp he gave Roy was warm and cordial as he said, "Well,
I'm not equal to much kicking yet, old fellow; but, for one, I
am tired of this old feud and think it is time we buried the hatchet."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad!" cried a merry voice in the doorway, and out
danced Helen with her hands full of flowers. "You dear, heroic
Carl. I have come to thank you, too, though I never, never can,
for rescuing me on that dreadful day, and, as some small return,
they have let me be the first to tell you of the silver lining
hidden behind that cloud of smoke."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Carl, thoroughly mystified.</p>

<p>"I mean that Christopher Columbus and his combustible companions
did a pretty good turn after all. They plowed up the ground under
the old barn so well that when the rubbish was cleared away there
came to light what promises to be the finest paint mine in the
whole country."</p>

<p>"Paint mine!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Non-inflammable, mineral paint that will not only
save the farm, but, perhaps, make all our fortunes."</p>

<p>"It's true, Carl, every word true," laughed Maizie, who had stolen
softly up. "Papa has had the ore analyzed, and is so happy he
beams like a full moon. Judge Hastings, too, has been so kind,
advancing funds, getting up a company and preparing to build a
kiln. It has been quite the excitement of the summer in Valleytown."</p>

<p>"Well, well! This is glorious news! Hip, hip, hooray!" a feeble
cheer that was echoed and re-echoed by the faction on the fence.</p>

<p>"Dear me, haven't you finished your revelations yet?" exclaimed
Mark Tripp, suddenly tumbling up the steps. "For if you have the
'Lilies of the Valley' request the captain of the 'Ground Moles'
and the young ladies to occupy the piazza chairs and witness a
pyrotechnical display postponed from the Fourth of July, but now
given in honor of the recovery of our esteemed citizen, Carl Duckworth,
and of our Peace Jubilee."</p>

<p>All laughed at Mark's pompous little speech and hastened to take
their places. So at last in a shower of golden sparks they buried
the hatchet and the feud between Valleytown and Hillside ended
forever amid a generous display of fire-works.</p>

<p><em>HANSCHEN AND THE HARES</em>.</p>

<p><em>FROM THE GERMAN, BY ELLEN T. SULLIVAN</em>.</p>

<p>Long ago, in a little house near a forest in Germany lived a
shoemaker and his wife. They were poor but contented and happy;
for they were willing to work and they had their snug little house
and food enough for themselves and their little Hanschens.</p>

<p>"Oh! if Hanschen would only grow like other boys, I should be
the happiest woman in the land," the mother used to say. "He is
six years old, yet he can stand on the palm of my hand."</p>

<p>"Well, if he is not so big as some of our neighbors' boys, he
is brighter than many of them," the father used to answer. Then
the mother felt so glad she would dance around the room with Hans
and say, "Yes, he is bright as a child can be and as spry too.
When he runs around the room I can hardly catch him."</p>

<p>One day she said to her husband, "I am going to the forest meadow
to cut fodder for the goat. The grass there is so sweet and juicy
that, if the goat eats it, we shall have the richest milk for
Hanschen. That will make him grow faster. I will take him with
me; he can sit in the grass and play with the flowers."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the father; "take care that he does not stray
away from you. Give him some clover blossoms to suck. We are too
poor to buy candy for him."</p>

<p>Out through the green forest went Hanschen and his mother. The
boy was so happy that his mother could hardly hold him, as he
laughed and jumped and clapped his hands. He thought the blue
sky was playing hide-and-seek with him through the treetops; that
the birds were singing a welcome to him, and that the bees, the
butterflies, and great dragon-flies were all glad to see him.
When they came to the meadow his mother put him down and gave
him some clover blossoms. Then she began to cut the grass and
soon she was quite a way from Hanschen, who was entirely hidden
by the tall grass.</p>

<p>While the mother was working Hanschen sat sucking his sweet clover
blossoms. All at once he heard a rustling, and there, beside him
were two little hares. He was not at all afraid. He nodded to
them and said, "How do you do?" The little hares had never seen
a child. They thought he was a hare, dressed up in a coat and
having a different kind of face from their own. They stared at
him a minute and then one said, "Hop! hop!" and sprang over a
grass stalk. "Can you do that?" said they to Hanschen. "Yes, indeed!"
said he, leaping quickly over a stalk, as he spoke. "Now," said
the hares, "we shall have a fine time playing together." And a
fine time they did have, leaping and racing until the sun was
low in the west, and the little hares began to think of supper
and bed.</p>

<p>"Come home with us; our father and mother will be good to you;"
they said to Hanschen. So he leaped away with the little hares
toward the green bushes where they lived.</p>

<p>Now there was another little hare, who had staid at home with
his mother that day. His bright eyes were the first to see the
three merry friends leaping toward the bushes. "Oh, mammy! mammy!"
he cried: "Just look through the bushes. Did you ever see such
a queer-looking hare as that little chap with my brothers?"</p>

<p>"Bring me my spectacles, child," said Mrs. Hare. "It may be the
poor thing has been hurt. That terrible hunter is around again.
He chased your poor father yesterday. Then that wicked old fox
is prowling about, too. It may be that one of them hurt the poor
little stranger so that he does not look natural. If so, I'll
soon cure him by good nursing."</p>

<p>That was what kind Mrs. Hare said to her little son. He brought
her spectacles, which she wiped and put on.</p>

<p>Then she cried out, "Why bless me! this is no hare! This is a
human child! He is lost and his parents will be wild with grief
for him. My children, I fear you led him astray. Tell just where
you found him and we will carry him back there in the morning.
It is so late now he must stay with us to-night."</p>

<p>"We thought he was a hare because he can spring and leap as well
as we can. We found him in the forest meadow and we have had splendid
fun together," said the little hares.</p>

<p>Then good Mrs. Hare gave Hanschen some hares' bread for his supper,
and soon after she tucked him snugly in bed with her sons. Before
putting him to bed she drew over him, a soft silky hare coat.
It fitted him nicely from the two furry ears to the little stubby
tail. The three little hares were delighted and said, "He's a
hare now, isn't he, mammy?" "Well, dears, he does look just like
one of you; but you must all lie still now and go to sleep for
we must get up with the sun, to-morrow," said Mrs. Hare.</p>

<p>In the meantime Hanschen's mother had finished cutting the grass,
and she looked for Hanschen and called him until it grew quite
dark. Then she went home, weeping bitterly, and told her husband
that their child was lost. Out ran the father then to look for
his boy; but he could not find him. All that night the poor parents
wept and moaned, while Hanschen was sleeping peacefully with the
little hares.</p>

<p>The Hare family got up at daylight, and all of them put on their
Sunday clothes, for Mr. Hare had said to his wife, "I want folks
to see that their child has been with good company; so please
put on your very best cap and brush all our children's coats until
they shine. I'll wear a high collar and my tall silk hat, and
you must tie my cravat in a nice bow."</p>

<p>When all were dressed they ate a good breakfast, locked up their
green gate and started for the meadow.</p>

<p>They had scarcely reached the edge of the forest, when they heard
Hanschen's mother calling, "Hanschen! Hanschen! darling!" "Here
I am, mother;" cried he. "I hear him! I hear him! Oh husband!
don't you?" said the mother. "I do hear his voice but I can see
nothing except a little brown hare."</p>

<p>Hanschen laughed in delight&mdash;sprang forward and pulled off his
furry coat. How surprised his father and mother were! By this
time the Hare family had come up and Mr. Hare took off his hat
and bowing very low, he said, "Mr. Man, this is my good wife and
these youngsters are my three sons. Their mother and I try to
teach them to do right, and they really are pretty good children.
Two of them were playing around here yesterday, and invited your
son to play with them, not knowing what sorrow and trouble they
caused you by leading him astray. They brought him home with them
last night. My good wife gave him plenty to eat; he slept with
my sons and you see the fine suit of hare-clothes he has just
taken off. I hope you will let him keep it to remember us by.
It is a present from all of us. We are only hares but we have
done by your child just what we should like you to do by one of
our children if you should find one of them astray. And now, my
dear sir, we will bid you farewell and go back to our home."</p>

<p>"Not yet! not yet!" cried Hanschen's father and mother. "Tell
us, do you have sorrows or troubles? One good turn deserves another.
We should be so glad to do something for you."</p>

<p>"Sorrows and troubles are plentiful in our lives," said Mr. Hare.
"If you can stop that terrible hunter from chasing us; and if
you can manage to trap that wicked Mr. Fox, will make us very
happy. And good Mrs. Man, if you will just throw a few cabbage
leaves out on the snow for us in the winter, when every green
thing is dead or buried; then we shall not have to go to bed hungry."</p>

<p>Hanschen's father and mother gladly promised to do all they could
for the good Hare family; then the two happy families went home.</p>

<p>One day soon after Hanschen's visit to the hares, his father
got up very early, for he had two pairs of shoes to finish that
day. He had scarcely begun his work when a very loud knock was
heard at the door. "Who can it be so early as this?" thought the
shoemaker. He opened the door and there stood &mdash;Mr. Fox!
"Good morning, shoemaker," said he; "I want you to make me a pair
of shoes and do it right off, too, or I'll kill every one of your
hens to-night. I'm hare hunting, to-day. I know where a whole
family of hares live, down near the forest. I mean to bag them
all before they leave their house this morning. They run so fast
it is hard to catch them when they are out. But, see one of my
shoes is torn, so I must have a new pair before I can walk so
far."</p>

<p>The shoemaker bowed and invited the fox to come in and sit down.
Then he said, "Mr. Fox, a great hunter like you ought to wear
high boots; not low shoes like common folks." That pleased Mr.
Fox, so he said, "Well, make high boots; but make them of the
finest, softest leather, and do not make them tight." The shoemaker
took the hardest, heaviest, leather he could find and soon finished
the boots. He put a piece of sticky wax into each boot. He said
to himself, "Mr. Fox thinks he is very sly but we'll see whether
he can catch our friends, the hares, when he puts on these boots."</p>

<p>Mr. Fox proudly drew on his boots but he said: "They seem stiff
and tight. I fear I cannot run very fast in them."</p>

<p>"Just wait till you have worn them a little while&mdash;new boots
generally feel stiff," said the shoemaker.</p>

<p>"Well, I will hurry off now; but I'll soon come back and bring
you the hares' skins to pay for the boots," said Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>A little while after the fox had gone the shoemaker's wife jumped
up in alarm from her chair. A hare had leaped in through the window
behind her. It was one of their friends&mdash;the father of the Hare
family. "Save me! the hunter is after me," he cried. "Here, quick!
jump into bed," said the shoemaker's wife. He did so, and she
covered him up, then she dressed Hanschen in the suit that the
hares had given him. She had scarcely done so when the hunter
came in and said, "Give me the hare that I have been chasing.
I saw him leap into your window. I must have him. There he is
now, springing on your table."</p>

<p>"There is my little Hanschen," said the shoemaker. "No wonder
you think he is a hare, for he can run as fast and leap as well
as any hare." "Yes," said Hanschen's mother, "and he often goes
out to play in this hare-suit&mdash;see how nicely it fits him. But,
Mr. Hunter, you must not shoot my Hanschen when you are out chasing
hares."</p>

<p>"Well," said the hunter, "if that isn't wonderful. But say, good
people, how in the world am I to know whether I am chasing Hanschen
or a hare?" "Oh, easily enough," said the shoemaker. "You have
only to wait a minute and call out, 'Hanschen!' If the little
creature sits up still and straight like a child, don't shoot,
for that will be Hanschen." "I will remember and call out," said
the hunter.</p>

<p>"Well, then, to pay you for your kindness, I'll tell you that
if you hurry toward the forest, now, you will be able to bag a
fox that cannot be far away; for the rogue has on a pair of boots
of my making, and he has hard work to move with them by this time,
I'll be bound."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Shoemaker," said the hunter; "I'll soon finish
him and bring you his hide to prove it. Only last night he killed
three of my hens." The hunter soon caught up with the fox, brought
his hide to the shoemaker and went away.</p>

<p>Then Hanschen's father told the hare to go home to his folks
and tell them that the old fox would never trouble them again,
and when they heard the hunter they were just to sit still and
straight on their hind legs. Mr. Hare flew over the ground on
his way home. His good news made him light-hearted and swift-footed.
Oh, how happy the hares were! To this day hares often sit up like
a child.</p>

<p>Hanschen often spent a day with the hares, and learned to run
so well, and spring forward so quickly, that all the people said
when he grew up, "He is the best man to have for a postman for
the villages around." So Hanschen became postman. He never forgot
his friends, the hares, but always carried some cabbage leaves
for them when snow and ice covered up or killed the green leaves.
'Tis said the hares used to watch for his coming, and sing this
song when they caught sight of him:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Our good friend, Hans,<br/>
Is a brave young man; hip, hurrah!<br/>
He springs as well<br/>
As the best hare can; hip, hurrah!<br/>
Beneath his coat<br/>
Is a good, warm heart; hip, hurrah!<br/>
We may be sure<br/>
He will take our part; hip, hurrah!<br/>
We need not starve<br/>
Though the world be white; hip, hurrah!<br/>
Our good friend, Hans<br/>
Will give us a bite; hip, hurrah!<br/>
This is his time<br/>
He is drawing near; hip, hurrah!<br/>
Off with hats; now<br/>
Cheer upon cheer; hip, hip, hurrah!"
