<BLOCKQUOTE>
Perplexed and troubled at his bad success<BR>
The Tempter stood, nor had what to reply,<BR>
Discovered in his fraud, thrown from his hope<BR>
So oft, and the persuasive rhetoric<BR>
That sleeked his tongue, and won so much on Eve,<BR>
So little here, nay lost.  But Eve was Eve;<BR>
This far his over-match, who, self-deceived<BR>
And rash, beforehand had no better weighed<BR>
The strength he was to cope with, or his own.<BR>
But--as a man who had been matchless held<BR>
In cunning, over-reached where least he thought,<BR>
To salve his credit, and for very spite,<BR>
Still will be tempting him who foils him still,<BR>
And never cease, though to his shame the more;<BR>
Or as a swarm of flies in vintage-time,<BR>
About the wine-press where sweet must is poured,<BR>
Beat off, returns as oft with humming sound;<BR>
Or surging waves against a solid rock,<BR>
Though all to shivers dashed, the assault renew,<BR>
(Vain battery!) and in froth or bubbles end--<BR>
So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse<BR>
Met ever, and to shameful silence brought,<BR>
Yet gives not o'er, though desperate of success,<BR>
And his vain importunity pursues.<BR>
He brought our Saviour to the western side<BR>
Of that high mountain, whence he might behold<BR>
Another plain, long, but in breadth not wide,<BR>
Washed by the southern sea, and on the north<BR>
To equal length backed with a ridge of hills<BR>
That screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men<BR>
From cold Septentrion blasts; thence in the midst<BR>
Divided by a river, off whose banks<BR>
On each side an Imperial City stood,<BR>
With towers and temples proudly elevate<BR>
On seven small hills, with palaces adorned,<BR>
Porches and theatres, baths, aqueducts,<BR>
Statues and trophies, and triumphal arcs,<BR>
Gardens and groves, presented to his eyes<BR>
Above the highth of mountains interposed--<BR>
By what strange parallax, or optic skill<BR>
Of vision, multiplied through air, or glass<BR>
Of telescope, were curious to enquire.<BR>
And now the Tempter thus his silence broke:--<BR>
<BR>
  "The city which thou seest no other deem<BR>
Than great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth<BR>
So far renowned, and with the spoils enriched<BR>
Of nations.  There the Capitol thou seest,<BR>
Above the rest lifting his stately head<BR>
On the Tarpeian rock, her citadel<BR>
Impregnable; and there Mount Palatine,<BR>
The imperial palace, compass huge, and high<BR>
The structure, skill of noblest architects,<BR>
With gilded battlements, conspicuous far,<BR>
Turrets, and terraces, and glittering spires.<BR>
Many a fair edifice besides, more like<BR>
Houses of gods--so well I have disposed<BR>
My aerie microscope--thou may'st behold,<BR>
Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs<BR>
Carved work, the hand of famed artificers<BR>
In cedar, marble, ivory, or gold.<BR>
Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see<BR>
What conflux issuing forth, or entering in:<BR>
Praetors, proconsuls to their provinces<BR>
Hasting, or on return, in robes of state;<BR>
Lictors and rods, the ensigns of their power;<BR>
Legions and cohorts, turms of horse and wings;<BR>
Or embassies from regions far remote,<BR>
In various habits, on the Appian road,<BR>
Or on the AEmilian--some from farthest south,<BR>
Syene, and where the shadow both way falls,<BR>
Meroe, Nilotic isle, and, more to west,<BR>
The realm of Bocchus to the Blackmoor sea;<BR>
From the Asian kings (and Parthian among these),<BR>
From India and the Golden Chersoness,<BR>
And utmost Indian isle Taprobane,<BR>
Dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed;<BR>
From Gallia, Gades, and the British west;<BR>
Germans, and Scythians, and Sarmatians north<BR>
Beyond Danubius to the Tauric pool.<BR>
All nations now to Rome obedience pay--<BR>
To Rome's great Emperor, whose wide domain,<BR>
In ample territory, wealth and power,<BR>
Civility of manners, arts and arms,<BR>
And long renown, thou justly may'st prefer<BR>
Before the Parthian.  These two thrones except,<BR>
The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight,<BR>
Shared among petty kings too far removed;<BR>
These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all<BR>
The kingdoms of the world, and all their glory.<BR>
This Emperor hath no son, and now is old,<BR>
Old and lascivious, and from Rome retired<BR>
To Capreae, an island small but strong<BR>
On the Campanian shore, with purpose there<BR>
His horrid lusts in private to enjoy;<BR>
Committing to a wicked favourite<BR>
All public cares, and yet of him suspicious;<BR>
Hated of all, and hating.  With what ease,<BR>
Endued with regal virtues as thou art,<BR>
Appearing, and beginning noble deeds,<BR>
Might'st thou expel this monster from his throne,<BR>
Now made a sty, and, in his place ascending,<BR>
A victor-people free from servile yoke!<BR>
And with my help thou may'st; to me the power<BR>
Is given, and by that right I give it thee.<BR>
Aim, therefore, at no less than all the world;<BR>
Aim at the highest; without the highest attained,<BR>
Will be for thee no sitting, or not long,<BR>
On David's throne, be prophesied what will."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Son of God, unmoved, replied:--<BR>
"Nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew<BR>
Of luxury, though called magnificence,<BR>
More than of arms before, allure mine eye,<BR>
Much less my mind; though thou should'st add to tell<BR>
Their sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts<BR>
On citron tables or Atlantic stone<BR>
(For I have also heard, perhaps have read),<BR>
Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne,<BR>
Chios and Crete, and how they quaff in gold,<BR>
Crystal, and myrrhine cups, imbossed with gems<BR>
And studs of pearl--to me should'st tell, who thirst<BR>
And hunger still.  Then embassies thou shew'st<BR>
From nations far and nigh!  What honour that,<BR>
But tedious waste of time, to sit and hear<BR>
So many hollow compliments and lies,<BR>
Outlandish flatteries?  Then proceed'st to talk<BR>
Of the Emperor, how easily subdued,<BR>
How gloriously.  I shall, thou say'st, expel<BR>
A brutish monster: what if I withal<BR>
Expel a Devil who first made him such?<BR>
Let his tormentor, Conscience, find him out;<BR>
For him I was not sent, nor yet to free<BR>
That people, victor once, now vile and base,<BR>
Deservedly made vassal--who, once just,<BR>
Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquered well,<BR>
But govern ill the nations under yoke,<BR>
Peeling their provinces, exhausted all<BR>
By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown<BR>
Of triumph, that insulting vanity;<BR>
Then cruel, by their sports to blood inured<BR>
Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts exposed;<BR>
Luxurious by their wealth, and greedier still,<BR>
And from the daily Scene effeminate.<BR>
What wise and valiant man would seek to free<BR>
These, thus degenerate, by themselves enslaved,<BR>
Or could of inward slaves make outward free?<BR>
Know, therefore, when my season comes to sit<BR>
On David's throne, it shall be like a tree<BR>
Spreading and overshadowing all the earth,<BR>
Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash<BR>
All monarchies besides throughout the world;<BR>
And of my Kingdom there shall be no end.<BR>
Means there shall be to this; but what the means<BR>
Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Tempter, impudent, replied:--<BR>
"I see all offers made by me how slight<BR>
Thou valuest, because offered, and reject'st.<BR>
Nothing will please the difficult and nice,<BR>
Or nothing more than still to contradict.<BR>
On the other side know also thou that I<BR>
On what I offer set as high esteem,<BR>
Nor what I part with mean to give for naught,<BR>
All these, which in a moment thou behold'st,<BR>
The kingdoms of the world, to thee I give<BR>
(For, given to me, I give to whom I please),<BR>
No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else--<BR>
On this condition, if thou wilt fall down,<BR>
And worship me as thy superior Lord<BR>
(Easily done), and hold them all of me;<BR>
For what can less so great a gift deserve?"<BR>
<BR>
  Whom thus our Saviour answered with disdain:--<BR>
"I never liked thy talk, thy offers less;<BR>
Now both abhor, since thou hast dared to utter<BR>
The abominable terms, impious condition.<BR>
But I endure the time, till which expired<BR>
Thou hast permission on me.  It is written,<BR>
The first of all commandments, 'Thou shalt worship<BR>
The Lord thy God, and only Him shalt serve.'<BR>
And dar'st thou to the Son of God propound<BR>
To worship thee, accursed? now more accursed<BR>
For this attempt, bolder than that on Eve,<BR>
And more blasphemous; which expect to rue.<BR>
The kingdoms of the world to thee were given!<BR>
Permitted rather, and by thee usurped;<BR>
Other donation none thou canst produce.<BR>
If given, by whom but by the King of kings,<BR>
God over all supreme?  If given to thee,<BR>
By thee how fairly is the Giver now<BR>
Repaid!  But gratitude in thee is lost<BR>
Long since.  Wert thou so void of fear or shame<BR>
As offer them to me, the Son of God--<BR>
To me my own, on such abhorred pact,<BR>
That I fall down and worship thee as God?<BR>
Get thee behind me!  Plain thou now appear'st<BR>
That Evil One, Satan for ever damned."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Fiend, with fear abashed, replied:--<BR>
"Be not so sore offended, Son of God--<BR>
Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men--<BR>
If I, to try whether in higher sort<BR>
Than these thou bear'st that title, have proposed<BR>
What both from Men and Angels I receive,<BR>
Tetrarchs of Fire, Air, Flood, and on the Earth<BR>
Nations besides from all the quartered winds--<BR>
God of this World invoked, and World beneath.<BR>
Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold<BR>
To me most fatal, me it most concerns.<BR>
The trial hath indamaged thee no way,<BR>
Rather more honour left and more esteem;<BR>
Me naught advantaged, missing what I aimed.<BR>
Therefore let pass, as they are transitory,<BR>
The kingdoms of this world; I shall no more<BR>
Advise thee; gain them as thou canst, or not.<BR>
And thou thyself seem'st otherwise inclined<BR>
Than to a worldly crown, addicted more<BR>
To contemplation and profound dispute;<BR>
As by that early action may be judged,<BR>
When, slipping from thy mother's eye, thou went'st<BR>
Alone into the Temple, there wast found<BR>
Among the gravest Rabbies, disputant<BR>
On points and questions fitting Moses' chair,<BR>
Teaching, not taught.  The childhood shews the man,<BR>
As morning shews the day.  Be famous, then,<BR>
By wisdom; as thy empire must extend,<BR>
So let extend thy mind o'er all the world<BR>
In knowledge; all things in it comprehend.<BR>
All knowledge is not couched in Moses' law,<BR>
The Pentateuch, or what the Prophets wrote;<BR>
The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach<BR>
To admiration, led by Nature's light;<BR>
And with the Gentiles much thou must converse,<BR>
Ruling them by persuasion, as thou mean'st.<BR>
Without their learning, how wilt thou with them,<BR>
Or they with thee, hold conversation meet?<BR>
How wilt thou reason with them, how refute<BR>
Their idolisms, traditions, paradoxes?<BR>
Error by his own arms is best evinced.<BR>
Look once more, ere we leave this specular mount,<BR>
Westward, much nearer by south-west; behold<BR>
Where on the AEgean shore a city stands,<BR>
Built nobly, pure the air and light the soil--<BR>
Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts<BR>
And Eloquence, native to famous wits<BR>
Or hospitable, in her sweet recess,<BR>
City or suburban, studious walks and shades.<BR>
See there the olive-grove of Academe,<BR>
Plato's retirement, where the Attic bird<BR>
Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long;<BR>
There, flowery hill, Hymettus, with the sound<BR>
Of bees' industrious murmur, oft invites<BR>
To studious musing; there Ilissus rowls<BR>
His whispering stream.  Within the walls then view<BR>
The schools of ancient sages--his who bred<BR>
Great Alexander to subdue the world,<BR>
Lyceum there; and painted Stoa next.<BR>
There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power<BR>
Of harmony, in tones and numbers hit<BR>
By voice or hand, and various-measured verse,<BR>
AEolian charms and Dorian lyric odes,<BR>
And his who gave them breath, but higher sung,<BR>
Blind Melesigenes, thence Homer called,<BR>
Whose poem Phoebus challenged for his own.<BR>
Thence what the lofty grave Tragedians taught<BR>
In chorus or iambic, teachers best<BR>
Of moral prudence, with delight received<BR>
In brief sententious precepts, while they treat<BR>
Of fate, and chance, and change in human life,<BR>
High actions and high passions best describing.<BR>
Thence to the famous Orators repair,<BR>
Those ancient whose resistless eloquence<BR>
Wielded at will that fierce democraty,<BR>
Shook the Arsenal, and fulmined over Greece<BR>
To Macedon and Artaxerxes' throne.<BR>
To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear,<BR>
From heaven descended to the low-roofed house<BR>
Of Socrates--see there his tenement--<BR>
Whom, well inspired, the Oracle pronounced<BR>
Wisest of men; from whose mouth issued forth<BR>
Mellifluous streams, that watered all the schools<BR>
Of Academics old and new, with those<BR>
Surnamed Peripatetics, and the sect<BR>
Epicurean, and the Stoic severe.<BR>
These here revolve, or, as thou likest, at home,<BR>
Till time mature thee to a kingdom's weight;<BR>
These rules will render thee a king complete<BR>
Within thyself, much more with empire joined."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom our Saviour sagely thus replied:--<BR>
"Think not but that I know these things; or, think<BR>
I know them not, not therefore am I short<BR>
Of knowing what I ought.  He who receives<BR>
Light from above, from the Fountain of Light,<BR>
No other doctrine needs, though granted true;<BR>
But these are false, or little else but dreams,<BR>
Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm.<BR>
The first and wisest of them all professed<BR>
To know this only, that he nothing knew;<BR>
The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits;<BR>
A third sort doubted all things, though plain sense;<BR>
Others in virtue placed felicity,<BR>
But virtue joined with riches and long life;<BR>
In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease;<BR>
The Stoic last in philosophic pride,<BR>
By him called virtue, and his virtuous man,<BR>
Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing,<BR>
Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer,<BR>
As fearing God nor man, contemning all<BR>
Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life--<BR>
Which, when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can;<BR>
For all his tedious talk is but vain boast,<BR>
Or subtle shifts conviction to evade.<BR>
Alas! what can they teach, and not mislead,<BR>
Ignorant of themselves, of God much more,<BR>
And how the World began, and how Man fell,<BR>
Degraded by himself, on grace depending?<BR>
Much of the Soul they talk, but all awry;<BR>
And in themselves seek virtue; and to themselves<BR>
All glory arrogate, to God give none;<BR>
Rather accuse him under usual names,<BR>
Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite<BR>
Of mortal things.  Who, therefore, seeks in these<BR>
True wisdom finds her not, or, by delusion<BR>
Far worse, her false resemblance only meets,<BR>
An empty cloud.  However, many books,<BR>
Wise men have said, are wearisome; who reads<BR>
Incessantly, and to his reading brings not<BR>
A spirit and judgment equal or superior,<BR>
(And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek?)<BR>
Uncertain and unsettled still remains,<BR>
Deep-versed in books and shallow in himself,<BR>
Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys<BR>
And trifles for choice matters, worth a sponge,<BR>
As children gathering pebbles on the shore.<BR>
Or, if I would delight my private hours<BR>
With music or with poem, where so soon<BR>
As in our native language can I find<BR>
That solace?  All our Law and Story strewed<BR>
With hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscribed,<BR>
Our Hebrew songs and harps, in Babylon<BR>
That pleased so well our victor's ear, declare<BR>
That rather Greece from us these arts derived--<BR>
Ill imitated while they loudest sing<BR>
The vices of their deities, and their own,<BR>
In fable, hymn, or song, so personating<BR>
Their gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame.<BR>
Remove their swelling epithetes, thick-laid<BR>
As varnish on a harlot's cheek, the rest,<BR>
Thin-sown with aught of profit or delight,<BR>
Will far be found unworthy to compare<BR>
With Sion's songs, to all true tastes excelling,<BR>
Where God is praised aright and godlike men,<BR>
The Holiest of Holies and his Saints<BR>
(Such are from God inspired, not such from thee);<BR>
Unless where moral virtue is expressed<BR>
By light of Nature, not in all quite lost.<BR>
Their orators thou then extoll'st as those<BR>
The top of eloquence--statists indeed,<BR>
And lovers of their country, as may seem;<BR>
But herein to our Prophets far beneath,<BR>
As men divinely taught, and better teaching<BR>
The solid rules of civil government,<BR>
In their majestic, unaffected style,<BR>
Than all the oratory of Greece and Rome.<BR>
In them is plainest taught, and easiest learnt,<BR>
What makes a nation happy, and keeps it so,<BR>
What ruins kingdoms, and lays cities flat;<BR>
These only, with our Law, best form a king."<BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Son of God; but Satan, now<BR>
Quite at a loss (for all his darts were spent),<BR>
Thus to our Saviour, with stern brow, replied:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Since neither wealth nor honour, arms nor arts,<BR>
Kingdom nor empire, pleases thee, nor aught<BR>
By me proposed in life contemplative<BR>
Or active, tended on by glory or fame,<BR>
What dost thou in this world?  The Wilderness<BR>
For thee is fittest place: I found thee there,<BR>
And thither will return thee.  Yet remember<BR>
What I foretell thee; soon thou shalt have cause<BR>
To wish thou never hadst rejected, thus<BR>
Nicely or cautiously, my offered aid,<BR>
Which would have set thee in short time with ease<BR>
On David's throne, or throne of all the world,<BR>
Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season,<BR>
When prophecies of thee are best fulfilled.<BR>
Now, contrary--if I read aught in heaven,<BR>
Or heaven write aught of fate--by what the stars<BR>
Voluminous, or single characters<BR>
In their conjunction met, give me to spell,<BR>
Sorrows and labours, opposition, hate,<BR>
Attends thee; scorns, reproaches, injuries,<BR>
Violence and stripes, and, lastly, cruel death.<BR>
A kingdom they portend thee, but what kingdom,<BR>
Real or allegoric, I discern not;<BR>
Nor when: eternal sure--as without end,<BR>
Without beginning; for no date prefixed<BR>
Directs me in the starry rubric set."<BR>
<BR>
  So saying, he took (for still he knew his power<BR>
Not yet expired), and to the Wilderness<BR>
Brought back, the Son of God, and left him there,<BR>
Feigning to disappear.  Darkness now rose,<BR>
As daylight sunk, and brought in louring Night,<BR>
Her shadowy offspring, unsubstantial both,<BR>
Privation mere of light and absent day.<BR>
Our Saviour, meek, and with untroubled mind<BR>
After hisaerie jaunt, though hurried sore,<BR>
Hungry and cold, betook him to his rest,<BR>
Wherever, under some concourse of shades,<BR>
Whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield<BR>
From dews and damps of night his sheltered head;<BR>
But, sheltered, slept in vain; for at his head<BR>
The Tempter watched, and soon with ugly dreams<BR>
Disturbed his sleep.  And either tropic now<BR>
'Gan thunder, and both ends of heaven; the clouds<BR>
From many a horrid rift abortive poured<BR>
Fierce rain with lightning mixed, water with fire,<BR>
In ruin reconciled; nor slept the winds<BR>
Within their stony caves, but rushed abroad<BR>
From the four hinges of the world, and fell<BR>
On the vexed wilderness, whose tallest pines,<BR>
Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest oaks,<BR>
Bowed their stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts,<BR>
Or torn up sheer.  Ill wast thou shrouded then,<BR>
O patient Son of God, yet only stood'st<BR>
Unshaken!  Nor yet staid the terror there:<BR>
Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round<BR>
Environed thee; some howled, some yelled, some shrieked,<BR>
Some bent at thee their fiery darts, while thou<BR>
Sat'st unappalled in calm and sinless peace.<BR>
Thus passed the night so foul, till Morning fair<BR>
Came forth with pilgrim steps, in amice grey,<BR>
Who with her radiant finger stilled the roar<BR>
Of thunder, chased the clouds, and laid the winds,<BR>
And griesly spectres, which the Fiend had raised<BR>
To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire.<BR>
And now the sun with more effectual beams<BR>
Had cheered the face of earth, and dried the wet<BR>
From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds,<BR>
Who all things now behold more fresh and green,<BR>
After a night of storm so ruinous,<BR>
Cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray,<BR>
To gratulate the sweet return of morn.<BR>
Nor yet, amidst this joy and brightest morn,<BR>
Was absent, after all his mischief done,<BR>
The Prince of Darkness; glad would also seem<BR>
Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came;<BR>
Yet with no new device (they all were spent),<BR>
Rather by this his last affront resolved,<BR>
Desperate of better course, to vent his rage<BR>
And mad despite to be so oft repelled.<BR>
Him walking on a sunny hill he found,<BR>
Backed on the north and west by a thick wood;<BR>
Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape,<BR>
And in a careless mood thus to him said:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Fair morning yet betides thee, Son of God,<BR>
After a dismal night.  I heard the wrack,<BR>
As earth and sky would mingle; but myself<BR>
Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them,<BR>
As dangerous to the pillared frame of Heaven,<BR>
Or to the Earth's dark basis underneath,<BR>
Are to the main as inconsiderable<BR>
And harmless, if not wholesome, as a sneeze<BR>
To man's less universe, and soon are gone.<BR>
Yet, as being ofttimes noxious where they light<BR>
On man, beast, plant, wasteful and turbulent,<BR>
Like turbulencies in the affairs of men,<BR>
Over whose heads they roar, and seem to point,<BR>
They oft fore-signify and threaten ill.<BR>
This tempest at this desert most was bent;<BR>
Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st.<BR>
Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject<BR>
The perfect season offered with my aid<BR>
To win thy destined seat, but wilt prolong<BR>
All to the push of fate, pursue thy way<BR>
Of gaining David's throne no man knows when<BR>
(For both the when and how is nowhere told),<BR>
Thou shalt be what thou art ordained, no doubt;<BR>
For Angels have proclaimed it, but concealing<BR>
The time and means?  Each act is rightliest done<BR>
Not when it must, but when it may be best.<BR>
If thou observe not this, be sure to find<BR>
What I foretold thee--many a hard assay<BR>
Of dangers, and adversities, and pains,<BR>
Ere thou of Israel's sceptre get fast hold;<BR>
Whereof this ominous night that closed thee round,<BR>
So many terrors, voices, prodigies,<BR>
May warn thee, as a sure foregoing sign."<BR>
<BR>
  So talked he, while the Son of God went on,<BR>
And staid not, but in brief him answered thus:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Me worse than wet thou find'st not; other harm<BR>
Those terrors which thou speak'st of did me none.<BR>
I never feared they could, though noising loud<BR>
And threatening nigh: what they can do as signs<BR>
Betokening or ill-boding I contemn<BR>
As false portents, not sent from God, but thee;<BR>
Who, knowing I shall reign past thy preventing,<BR>
Obtrud'st thy offered aid, that I, accepting,<BR>
At least might seem to hold all power of thee,<BR>
Ambitious Spirit! and would'st be thought my God;<BR>
And storm'st, refused, thinking to terrify<BR>
Me to thy will!  Desist (thou art discerned,<BR>
And toil'st in vain), nor me in vain molest."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Fiend, now swoln with rage, replied:--<BR>
"Then hear, O Son of David, virgin-born!<BR>
For Son of God to me is yet in doubt.<BR>
Of the Messiah I have heard foretold<BR>
By all the Prophets; of thy birth, at length<BR>
Announced by Gabriel, with the first I knew,<BR>
And of the angelic song in Bethlehem field,<BR>
On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born.<BR>
From that time seldom have I ceased to eye<BR>
Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth,<BR>
Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred;<BR>
Till, at the ford of Jordan, whither all<BR>
Flocked to the Baptist, I among the rest<BR>
(Though not to be baptized), by voice from Heaven<BR>
Heard thee pronounced the Son of God beloved.<BR>
Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view<BR>
And narrower scrutiny, that I might learn<BR>
In what degree or meaning thou art called<BR>
The Son of God, which bears no single sense.<BR>
The Son of God I also am, or was;<BR>
And, if I was, I am; relation stands:<BR>
All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought<BR>
In some respect far higher so declared.<BR>
Therefore I watched thy footsteps from that hour,<BR>
And followed thee still on to this waste wild,<BR>
Where, by all best conjectures, I collect<BR>
Thou art to be my fatal enemy.<BR>
Good reason, then, if I beforehand seek<BR>
To understand my adversary, who<BR>
And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent;<BR>
By parle or composition, truce or league,<BR>
To win him, or win from him what I can.<BR>
And opportunity I here have had<BR>
To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee<BR>
Proof against all temptation, as a rock<BR>
Of adamant and as a centre, firm<BR>
To the utmost of mere man both wise and good,<BR>
Not more; for honours, riches, kingdoms, glory,<BR>
Have been before contemned, and may again.<BR>
Therefore, to know what more thou art than man,<BR>
Worth naming the Son of God by voice from Heaven,<BR>
Another method I must now begin."<BR>
<BR>
  So saying, he caught him up, and, without wing<BR>
Of hippogrif, bore through the air sublime,<BR>
Over the wilderness and o'er the plain,<BR>
Till underneath them fair Jerusalem,<BR>
The Holy City, lifted high her towers,<BR>
And higher yet the glorious Temple reared<BR>
Her pile, far off appearing like a mount<BR>
Of alablaster, topt with golden spires:<BR>
There, on the highest pinnacle, he set<BR>
The Son of God, and added thus in scorn:--<BR>
<BR>
  "There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright<BR>
Will ask thee skill.  I to thy Father's house<BR>
Have brought thee, and highest placed: highest is best.<BR>
Now shew thy progeny; if not to stand,<BR>
Cast thyself down.  Safely, if Son of God;<BR>
For it is written, 'He will give command<BR>
Concerning thee to his Angels; in their hands<BR>
They shall uplift thee, lest at any time<BR>
Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.'"<BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus Jesus: "Also it is written,<BR>
'Tempt not the Lord thy God.'"  He said, and stood;<BR>
But Satan, smitten with amazement, fell.<BR>
As when Earth's son, Antaeus (to compare<BR>
Small things with greatest), in Irassa strove<BR>
With Jove's Alcides, and, oft foiled, still rose,<BR>
Receiving from his mother Earth new strength,<BR>
Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joined,<BR>
Throttled at length in the air expired and fell,<BR>
So, after many a foil, the Tempter proud,<BR>
Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride<BR>
Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall;<BR>
And, as that Theban monster that proposed<BR>
Her riddle, and him who solved it not devoured,<BR>
That once found out and solved, for grief and spite<BR>
Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep,<BR>
So, strook with dread and anguish, fell the Fiend,<BR>
And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought<BR>
Joyless triumphals of his hoped success,<BR>
Ruin, and desperation, and dismay,<BR>
Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God.<BR>
So Satan fell; and straight a fiery globe<BR>
Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh,<BR>
Who on their plumy vans received Him soft<BR>
From his uneasy station, and upbore,<BR>
As on a floating couch, through the blithe air;<BR>
Then, in a flowery valley, set him down<BR>
On a green bank, and set before him spread<BR>
A table of celestial food, divine<BR>
Ambrosial fruits fetched from the Tree of Life,<BR>
And from the Fount of Life ambrosial drink,<BR>
That soon refreshed him wearied, and repaired<BR>
What hunger, if aught hunger, had impaired,<BR>
Or thirst; and, as he fed, Angelic quires<BR>
Sung heavenly anthems of his victory<BR>
Over temptation and the Tempter proud:--<BR>
<BR>
  "True Image of the Father, whether throned<BR>
In the bosom of bliss, and light of light<BR>
Conceiving, or, remote from Heaven, enshrined<BR>
In fleshly tabernacle and human form,<BR>
Wandering the wilderness--whatever place,<BR>
Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing<BR>
The Son of God, with Godlike force endued<BR>
Against the attempter of thy Father's throne<BR>
And thief of Paradise!  Him long of old<BR>
Thou didst debel, and down from Heaven cast<BR>
With all his army; now thou hast avenged<BR>
Supplanted Adam, and, by vanquishing<BR>
Temptation, hast regained lost Paradise,<BR>
And frustrated the conquest fraudulent.<BR>
He never more henceforth will dare set foot<BR>
In paradise to tempt; his snares are broke.<BR>
For, though that seat of earthly bliss be failed,<BR>
A fairer Paradise is founded now<BR>
For Adam and his chosen sons, whom thou,<BR>
A Saviour, art come down to reinstall;<BR>
Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be,<BR>
Of tempter and temptation without fear.<BR>
But thou, Infernal Serpent! shalt not long<BR>
Rule in the clouds.  Like an autumnal star,<BR>
Or lightning, thou shalt fall from Heaven, trod down<BR>
Under his feet.  For proof, ere this thou feel'st<BR>
Thy wound (yet not thy last and deadliest wound)<BR>
By this repulse received, and hold'st in Hell<BR>
No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues<BR>
Thy bold attempt.  Hereafter learn with awe<BR>
To dread the Son of God.  He, all unarmed,<BR>
Shall chase thee, with the terror of his voice,<BR>
From thy demoniac holds, possession foul--<BR>
Thee and thy legions; yelling they shall fly,<BR>
And beg to hide them in a herd of swine,<BR>
Lest he command them down into the Deep,<BR>
Bound, and to torment sent before their time.<BR>
Hail, Son of the Most High, heir of both Worlds,<BR>
Queller of Satan!  On thy glorious work<BR>
Now enter, and begin to save Mankind."<BR>
<BR>
  Thus they the Son of God, our Saviour meek,<BR>
Sung victor, and, from heavenly feast refreshed,<BR>
Brought on his way with joy.  He, unobserved,<BR>
Home to his mother's house private returned.<BR>
