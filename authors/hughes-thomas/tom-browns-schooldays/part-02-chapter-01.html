<p>The turning-point in our hero's school career had now come, and
the manner of it was as follows. On the evening of the first day
of the next half-year, Tom, East, and another School-house boy,
who had just been dropped at the Spread Eagle by the old Regulator,
rushed into the matron's room in high spirits, such as all real
boys are in when they first get back, however fond they may be
of home.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Wixie," shouted one, seizing on the methodical, active,
little dark-eyed woman, who was busy stowing away the linen of
the boys who had already arrived into their several pigeon-holes,
"here we are again, you see, as jolly as ever. Let us help you
put the things away."</p>

<p>"And, Mary," cried another (she was called indifferently by either
name), "who's come back? Has the Doctor made old Jones leave?
How many new boys are there?"</p>

<p>"Am I and East to have Gray's study? You know you promised to
get it for us if you could," shouted Tom.</p>

<p>"And am I to sleep in Number 4?" roared East.</p>

<p>"How's old Sam, and Bogle, and Sally?"</p>

<p>"Bless the boys!" cries Mary, at last getting in a word; "why,
you'll shake me to death. There, now, do go away up to the housekeeper's
room and get your suppers; you know I haven't time to talk. You'll
find plenty more in the house. &mdash;Now, Master East, do let
those things alone. You're mixing up three new boys' things."
And she rushed at East, who escaped round the open trunks holding
up a prize.</p>

<p>"Hullo! look here, Tommy," shouted he; "here's fun!" and he brandished
above his head some pretty little night-caps, beautifully made
and marked, the work of loving fingers in some distant country
home. The kind mother and sisters who sewed that delicate stitching
with aching hearts little thought of the trouble they might be
bringing on the young head for which they were meant. The little
matron was wiser, and snatched the caps from East before he could
look at the name on them.</p>

<p>"Now, Master East, I shall be very angry if you don't go," said
she; "there's some capital cold beef and pickles upstairs, and
I won't have you old boys in my room first night."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the pickles! Come along, Tommy&mdash;come along, Smith.
We shall find out who the young count is, I'll be bound. I hope
he'll sleep in my room. Mary's always vicious first week."</p>

<p>As the boys turned to leave the room, the matron touched Tom's
arm, and said, "Master Brown, please stop a minute; I want to
speak to you."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mary. I'll come in a minute, East. Don't finish the
pickles."</p>

<p>"O Master Brown," went on the little matron, when the rest had
gone, "you're to have Gray's study, Mrs. Arnold says. And she
wants you to take in this young gentleman. He's a new boy, and
thirteen years old though he don't look it. He's very delicate,
and has never been from home before. And I told Mrs. Arnold I
thought you'd be kind to him, and see that they don't bully him
at first. He's put into your form, and I've given him the bed
next to yours in Number 4; so East can't sleep there this half."</p>

<p>Tom was rather put about by this speech. He had got the double
study which he coveted, but here were conditions attached which
greatly moderated his joy. He looked across the room, and in the
far corner of the sofa was aware of a slight, pale boy, with large
blue eyes and light fair hair, who seemed ready to shrink through
the floor. He saw at a glance that the little stranger was just
the boy whose first half-year at a public school would be misery
to himself if he were left alone, or constant anxiety to any one
who meant to see him through his troubles. Tom was too honest
to take in the youngster, and then let him shift for himself;
and if he took him as his chum instead of East, where were all
his pet plans of having a bottled-beer cellar under his window,
and making night-lines and slings, and plotting expeditions to
Brownsover Mills and Caldecott's Spinney? East and he had made
up their minds to get this study, and then every night from locking-up
till ten they would be together to talk about fishing, drink bottled-beer,
read Marryat's novels, and sort birds' eggs. And this new boy
would most likely never go out of the close, and would be afraid
of wet feet, and always getting laughed at, and called Molly,
or Jenny, or some derogatory feminine nickname.</p>

<p>The matron watched him for a moment, and saw what was passing
in his mind, and so, like a wise negotiator, threw in an appeal
to his warm heart. "Poor little fellow," said she, in almost a
whisper; "his father's dead, and he's got no brothers. And his
mamma&mdash;such a kind, sweet lady&mdash;almost broke her heart at leaving
him this morning; and she said one of his sisters was like to
die of decline, and so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well," burst in Tom, with something like a sigh at the
effort, "I suppose I must give up East. &mdash;Come along, young
un. What's your name? We'll go and have some supper, and then
I'll show you our study."</p>

<p>"His name's George Arthur," said the matron, walking up to him
with Tom, who grasped his little delicate hand as the proper preliminary
to making a chum of him, and felt as if he could have blown him
away. "I've had his books and things put into the study, which
his mamma has had new papered, and the sofa covered, and new green-baize
curtains over the door" (the diplomatic matron threw this in,
to show that the new boy was contributing largely to the partnership
comforts). "And Mrs. Arnold told me to say," she added, "that
she should like you both to come up to tea with her. You know
the way, Master Brown, and the things are just gone up, I know."</p>

<p>Here was an announcement for Master Tom! He was to go up to tea
the first night, just as if he were a sixth or fifth form boy,
and of importance in the School world, instead of the most reckless
young scapegrace amongst the fags. He felt himself lifted on to
a higher social and moral platform at once. Nevertheless he couldn't
give up without a sigh the idea of the jolly supper in the housekeeper's
room with East and the rest, and a rush round to all the studies
of his friends afterwards, to pour out the deeds and wonders of
the holidays, to plot fifty plans for the coming half-year, and
to gather news of who had left and what new boys had come, who
had got who's study, and where the new praepostors slept. However,
Tom consoled himself with thinking that he couldn't have done
all this with the new boy at his heels, and so marched off along
the passages to the Doctor's private house with his young charge
in tow, in monstrous good-humour with himself and all the world.</p>

<p>It is needless, and would be impertinent, to tell how the two
young boys were received in that drawing-room. The lady who presided
there is still living, and has carried with her to her peaceful
home in the north the respect and love of all those who ever felt
and shared that gentle and high-bred hospitality. Ay, many is
the brave heart, now doing its work and bearing its load in country
curacies, London chambers, under the Indian sun, and in Australian
towns and clearings, which looks back with fond and grateful memory
to that School-house drawing-room, and dates much of its highest
and best training to the lessons learnt there.</p>

<p>Besides Mrs. Arnold and one or two of the elder children, there
were one of the younger masters, young Brooke (who was now in
the sixth, and had succeeded to his brother's position and influence),
and another sixth-form boy, talking together before the fire.
The master and young Brooke, now a great strapping fellow six
feet high, eighteen years old, and powerful as a coal-heaver,
nodded kindly to Tom, to his intense glory, and then went on talking.
The other did not notice them. The hostess, after a few kind words,
which led the boys at once and insensibly to feel at their ease
and to begin talking to one another, left them with her own children
while she finished a letter. The young ones got on fast and well,
Tom holding forth about a prodigious pony he had been riding out
hunting, and hearing stories of the winter glories of the lakes,
when tea came in, and immediately after the Doctor himself.</p>

<p>How frank, and kind, and manly was his greeting to the party
by the fire! It did Tom's heart good to see him and young Brooke
shake hands, and look one another in the face; and he didn't fail
to remark that Brooke was nearly as tall and quite as broad as
the Doctor. And his cup was full when in another moment his master
turned to him with another warm shake of the hand, and, seemingly
oblivious of all the late scrapes which he had been getting into,
said, "Ah, Brown, you here! I hope you left your father and all
well at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, quite well."</p>

<p>"And this is the little fellow who is to share your study. Well,
he doesn't look as we should like to see him. He wants some Rugby
air, and cricket. And you must take him some good long walks,
to Bilton Grange, and Caldecott's Spinney, and show him what a
little pretty country we have about here."</p>

<p>Tom wondered if the Doctor knew that his visits to Bilton Grange
were for the purpose of taking rooks' nests (a proceeding strongly
discountenanced by the owner thereof), and those to Caldecott's
Spinney were prompted chiefly by the conveniences for setting
night-lines. What didn't the Doctor know? And what a noble use
he always made of it! He almost resolved to abjure rook-pies and
night-lines for ever. The tea went merrily off, the Doctor now
talking of holiday doings, and then of the prospects of the half-year&mdash;what
chance there was for the Balliol scholarship, whether the eleven
would be a good one. Everybody was at his ease, and everybody
felt that he, young as he might be, was of some use in the little
School world, and had a work to do there.</p>

<p>Soon after tea the Doctor went off to his study, and the young
boys a few minutes afterwards took their leave and went out of
the private door which led from the Doctor's house into the middle
passage.</p>

<p>At the fire, at the farther end of the passage, was a crowd of
boys in loud talk and laughter. There was a sudden pause when
the door opened, and then a great shout of greeting, as Tom was
recognized marching down the passage.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Brown! where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been to tea with the Doctor," says Tom, with great
dignity.</p>

<p>"My eye!" cried East, "Oh! so that's why Mary called you back,
and you didn't come to supper. You lost something. That beef and
pickles was no end good."</p>

<p>"I say, young fellow," cried Hall, detecting Arthur and catching
him by the collar, "what's your name? Where do you come from?
How old are you?"</p>

<p>Tom saw Arthur shrink back and look scared as all the group turned
to him, but thought it best to let him answer, just standing by
his side to support in case of need.</p>

<p>"Arthur, sir. I come from Devonshire."</p>

<p>"Don't call me 'sir,' you young muff. How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Thirteen."</p>

<p>"Can you sing?"</p>

<p>The poor boy was trembling and hesitating. Tom struck in&mdash;"You
be hanged, Tadpole. He'll have to sing, whether he can or not,
Saturday twelve weeks, and that's long enough off yet."</p>

<p>"Do you know him at home, Brown?"</p>

<p>"No; but he's my chum in Gray's old study, and it's near prayer-time,
and I haven't had a look at it yet. &mdash;Come along, Arthur."</p>

<p>Away went the two, Tom longing to get his charge safe under cover,
where he might advise him on his deportment.</p>

<p>"What a queer chum for Tom Brown," was the comment at the fire;
and it must be confessed so thought Tom himself, as he lighted
his candle, and surveyed the new green-baize curtains and the
carpet and sofa with much satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I say, Arthur, what a brick your mother is to make us so cozy!
But look here now; you must answer straight up when the fellows
speak to you, and don't be afraid. If you're afraid, you'll get
bullied. And don't you say you can sing; and don't you ever talk
about home, or your mother and sisters."</p>

<p>Poor little Arthur looked ready to cry.</p>

<p>"But, please," said he, "mayn't I talk about&mdash;about home to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; I like it. But don't talk to boys you don't know, or
they'll call you home-sick, or mamma's darling, or some such stuff.
What a jolly desk! Is that yours? And what stunning binding! Why,
your school-books look like novels."</p>

<p>And Tom was soon deep in Arthur's goods and chattels, all new,
and good enough for a fifth-form boy, and hardly thought of his
friends outside till the prayer-bell rang.</p>

<p>I have already described the School-house prayers. They were
the same on the first night as on the other nights, save for the
gaps caused by the absence of those boys who came late, and the
line of new boys who stood all together at the farther table&mdash;of
all sorts and sizes, like young bears with all their troubles
to come, as Tom's father had said to him when he was in the same
position. He thought of it as he looked at the line, and poor
little slight Arthur standing with them, and as he was leading
him upstairs to Number 4, directly after prayers, and showing
him his bed. It was a huge, high, airy room, with two large windows
looking on to the School close. There were twelve beds in the
room. The one in the farthest corner by the fireplace, occupied
by the sixth-form boy, who was responsible for the discipline
of the room, and the rest by boys in the lower-fifth and other
junior forms, all fags (for the fifth-form boys, as has been said,
slept in rooms by themselves). Being fags, the eldest of them
was not more than about sixteen years old, and were all bound
to be up and in bed by ten. The sixth-form boys came to bed from
ten to a quarter-past (at which time the old verger came round
to put the candles out), except when they sat up to read.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes therefore of their entry, all the other
boys who slept in Number 4 had come up. The little fellows went
quietly to their own beds, and began undressing, and talking to
each other in whispers; while the elder, amongst whom was Tom,
sat chatting about on one another's beds, with their jackets and
waistcoats off. Poor little Arthur was overwhelmed with the novelty
of his position. The idea of sleeping in the room with strange
boys had clearly never crossed his mind before, and was as painful
as it was strange to him. He could hardly bear to take his jacket
off; however, presently, with an effort, off it came, and then
he paused and looked at Tom, who was sitting at the bottom of
his bed talking and laughing.</p>

<p>"Please, Brown," he whispered, "may I wash my face and hands?"</p>

<p>"Of course, if you like," said Tom, staring; "that's your washhand-stand,
under the window, second from your bed. You'll have to go down
for more water in the morning if you use it all." And on he went
with his talk, while Arthur stole timidly from between the beds
out to his washhand-stand, and began his ablutions, thereby drawing
for a moment on himself the attention of the room.</p>

<p>On went the talk and laughter. Arthur finished his washing and
undressing, and put on his night-gown. He then looked round more
nervously than ever. Two or three of the little boys were already
in bed, sitting up with their chins on their knees. The light
burned clear, the noise went on. It was a trying moment for the
poor little lonely boy; however, this time he didn't ask Tom what
he might or might not do, but dropped on his knees by his bedside,
as he had done every day from his childhood, to open his heart
to Him who heareth the cry and beareth the sorrows of the tender
child, and the strong man in agony.</p>

<p>Tom was sitting at the bottom of his bed unlacing his boots,
so that his back was towards Arthur, and he didn't see what had
happened, and looked up in wonder at the sudden silence. Then
two or three boys laughed and sneered, and a big, brutal fellow
who was standing in the middle of the room picked up a slipper,
and shied it at the kneeling boy, calling him a snivelling young
shaver. Then Tom saw the whole, and the next moment the boot he
had just pulled off flew straight at the head of the bully, who
had just time to throw up his arm and catch it on his elbow.</p>

<p>"Confound you, Brown! what's that for?" roared he, stamping with
pain.</p>

<p>"Never mind what I mean," said Tom, stepping on to the floor,
every drop of blood in his body tingling; "if any fellow wants
the other boot, he knows how to get it."</p>

<p>What would have been the result is doubtful, for at this moment
the sixth-form boy came in, and not another word could be said.
Tom and the rest rushed into bed and finished their unrobing there,
and the old verger, as punctual as the clock, had put out the
candle in another minute, and toddled on to the next room, shutting
their door with his usual "Good-night, gen'lm'n."</p>

<p>There were many boys in the room by whom that little scene was
taken to heart before they slept. But sleep seemed to have deserted
the pillow of poor Tom. For some time his excitement, and the
flood of memories which chased one another through his brain,
kept him from thinking or resolving. His head throbbed, his heart
leapt, and he could hardly keep himself from springing out of
bed and rushing about the room. Then the thought of his own mother
came across him, and the promise he had made at her knee, years
ago, never to forget to kneel by his bedside, and give himself
up to his Father, before he laid his head on the pillow, from
which it might never rise; and he lay down gently, and cried as
if his heart would break. He was only fourteen years old.</p>

<p>It was no light act of courage in those days, my dear boys, for
a little fellow to say his prayers publicly, even at Rugby. A
few years later, when Arnold's manly piety had begun to leaven
the School, the tables turned; before he died, in the School-house
at least, and I believe in the other house, the rule was the other
way. But poor Tom had come to school in other times. The first
few nights after he came he did not kneel down because of the
noise, but sat up in bed till the candle was out, and then stole
out and said his prayers, in fear lest some one should find him
out. So did many another poor little fellow. Then he began to
think that he might just as well say his prayers in bed, and then
that it didn't matter whether he was kneeling, or sitting, or
lying down. And so it had come to pass with Tom, as with all who
will not confess their Lord before men; and for the last year
he had probably not said his prayers in earnest a dozen times.</p>

<p>Poor Tom! the first and bitterest feeling which was like to break
his heart was the sense of his own cowardice. The vice of all
others which he loathed was brought in and burnt in on his own
soul. He had lied to his mother, to his conscience, to his God.
How could he bear it? And then the poor little weak boy, whom
he had pitied and almost scorned for his weakness, had done that
which he, braggart as he was, dared not do. The first dawn of
comfort came to him in swearing to himself that he would stand
by that boy through thick and thin, and cheer him, and help him,
and bear his burdens for the good deed done that night. Then he
resolved to write home next day and tell his mother all, and what
a coward her son had been. And then peace came to him as he resolved,
lastly, to bear his testimony next morning. The morning would
be harder than the night to begin with, but he felt that he could
not afford to let one chance slip. Several times he faltered,
for the devil showed him first all his old friends calling him
"Saint" and "Square-toes," and a dozen hard names, and whispered
to him that his motives would be misunderstood, and he would only
be left alone with the new boy; whereas it was his duty to keep
all means of influence, that he might do good to the largest number.
And then came the more subtle temptation, "Shall I not be showing
myself braver than others by doing this? Have I any right to begin
it now? Ought I not rather to pray in my own study, letting other
boys know that I do so, and trying to lead them to it, while in
public at least I should go on as I have done?" However, his good
angel was too strong that night, and he turned on his side and
slept, tired of trying to reason, but resolved to follow the impulse
which had been so strong, and in which he had found peace.</p>

<p>Next morning he was up and washed and dressed, all but his jacket
and waistcoat, just as the ten minutes' bell began to ring, and
then in the face of the whole room knelt down to pray. Not five
words could he say&mdash;the bell mocked him; he was listening for
every whisper in the room&mdash;what were they all thinking of him?
He was ashamed to go on kneeling, ashamed to rise from his knees.
At last, as it were from his inmost heart, a still, small voice
seemed to breathe forth the words of the publican, "God be merciful
to me a sinner!" He repeated them over and over, clinging to them
as for his life, and rose from his knees comforted and humbled,
and ready to face the whole world. It was not needed: two other
boys besides Arthur had already followed his example, and he went
down to the great School with a glimmering of another lesson in
his heart&mdash;the lesson that he who has conquered his own coward
spirit has conquered the whole outward world; and that other one
which the old prophet learnt in the cave in Mount Horeb, when
he hid his face, and the still, small voice asked, "What doest
thou here, Elijah?" that however we may fancy ourselves alone
on the side of good, the King and Lord of men is nowhere without
His witnesses; for in every society, however seemingly corrupt
and godless, there are those who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</p>

<p>He found, too, how greatly he had exaggerated the effect to be
produced by his act. For a few nights there was a sneer or a laugh
when he knelt down, but this passed off soon, and one by one all
the other boys but three or four followed the lead. I fear that
this was in some measure owing to the fact that Tom could probably
have thrashed any boy in the room except the praepostor; at any
rate, every boy knew that he would try upon very slight provocation,
and didn't choose to run the risk of a hard fight because Tom
Brown had taken a fancy to say his prayers. Some of the small
boys of Number 4 communicated the new state of things to their
chums, and in several other rooms the poor little fellows tried
it on&mdash;in one instance or so, where the praepostor heard of it
and interfered very decidedly, with partial success; but in the
rest, after a short struggle, the confessors were bullied or laughed
down, and the old state of things went on for some time longer.
Before either Tom Brown or Arthur left the School-house, there
was no room in which it had not become the regular custom. I trust
it is so still, and that the old heathen state of things has gone
out for ever.</p>
