<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Aulnes Woods were brown and still under their unshed canopy of
October leaves. Against a grey, transparent sky the oaks and beeches
towered, unstirred by any wind; in the subdued light among the
trees, ferns, startlingly green, spread delicate plumed fronds;
there was no sound except the soft crash of his own footsteps
through shriveling patches of brake; no movement save when a yellow
leaf fluttered down from above or one of those little silvery
grey moths took wing and fluttered aimlessly along the forest
aisle, only to alight upon some lichen-spotted tree and cling
there, slowly waving its delicate, translucent wings.</p>

<p>It was a very ancient wood, the Forest of Aulnes, and the old
trees were long past timber value. Even those gleaners of dead
wood and fallen branches seemed to have passed a different way,
for the forest floor was littered with material that seldom goes
to waste in Europe, and which broke under foot with a dull, thick
sound, filling the nostrils with the acrid odour of decay.</p>

<p>Narrow paths full of dead leaves ran here and there through the
woods, but he took none of these, keeping straight on toward the
northwest until a high, moss-grown wall checked his progress.</p>

<p>It ran west through the silent forest; damp green mould and lichens
stained it; patches of grey stucco had peeled from it, revealing
underneath the roughly dressed stones. He followed the wall.</p>

<p>Now and then, far in the forest, and indistinctly, he heard faint
sounds&mdash;perhaps the cautious tread of roebuck, or rabbits in the
bracken, or the patter of a stoat over dry leaves; perhaps the
sullen retirement of some wild boar, winding man in the depths
of his own domain, and sulkily conceding him right of way.</p>

<p>After a while there came a break in the wall where four great
posts of stone stood, and where there should have been gates.</p>

<p>But only the ancient and rusting hinges remained of either gate
or wicket.</p>

<p>He looked up at the carved escutcheons; the moss of many centuries
had softened and smothered the sculptured device, so that its
form had become indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Inside stood a stone lodge. Tiles had fallen from the ancient
roof; leaded panes were broken; nobody came to the closed and
discoloured door of massive oak.</p>

<p>The avenue, which was merely an unkempt, overgrown ride, curved
away between the great gateposts into the woods; and, as he entered
it, three deer left stealthily, making no sound in the forest.</p>

<p>Nobody was to be seen, neither gatekeeper nor woodchopper nor
charcoal burner. Nothing moved amid the trees except a tiny, silent
bird belated in his autumn migration.</p>

<p>The ride curved to the east; and abruptly he came into view of
the house&mdash;a low, weather-ravaged structure in the grassy glade,
ringed by a square, wet moat.</p>

<p>There was no terrace; the ride crossed a permanent bridge of
stone, passed the carved and massive entrance, crossed a second
crumbling causeway, and continued on into the forest.</p>

<p>An old Breton woman, who was drawing a jug of water from the
moat, turned and looked at Neeland, and then went silently into
the house.</p>

<p>A moment later a younger woman appeared on the doorstep and stood
watching his approach.</p>

<p>As he crossed the bridge he took off his cap.</p>

<p>"Madame, the Countess of Aulnes?" he inquired. "Would you be
kind enough to say to her that I arrive from Lorient at her request?"</p>

<p>"I am the Countess of Aulnes," she said in flawless English.</p>

<p>He bowed again. "I am Captain Neeland of the British Expeditionary
force."</p>

<p>"May I see your credentials, Captain Neeland?" She had descended
the single step of crumbling stone.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Countess; may I first be certain concerning <em>your</em>
identity?"</p>

<p>There was a silence. To Neeland she seemed very young in her
black gown. Perhaps it was that sombre setting and her dark eyes
and hair which made her skin seem so white.</p>

<p>"What proof of my identity do you expect?" she asked in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Only one word, Madame."</p>

<p>She moved a step nearer, bent a trifle toward him. "L’Ombre,"
she whispered.</p>

<p>From his pocket he drew his credentials and offered them. Among
them was her own letter to the authorities at Lorient.</p>

<p>After she had examined them she handed them back to him.</p>

<p>"Will you come in, Captain Neeland&mdash;or, perhaps we had better
seat ourselves on the bridge&mdash;in order to lose no time&mdash;because
I wish you to see for yourself&#11834;"</p>

<p>She lifted her dark eyes; a tint of embarrassment came into her
cheeks: "It may seem absurd to you; it seems so to me, at times&mdash;what
I am going to say to you&mdash;concerning L’Ombre&#11834;"</p>

<p>She had turned; he followed; and at her grave gesture of invitation,
he seated himself beside her on the coping of mossy stone which
ran like a bench under the parapet of the little bridge.</p>

<p>"Captain Neeland," she said, "I am a Bretonne, but, until recently,
I did not suppose myself to be superstitious.... I really am not&mdash;unless&mdash;except
for this one matter of L’Ombre.... My English governess drove
superstition out of my head.... Still, living in Finistère&mdash;here
in this house"&mdash;she flushed again&mdash;"I shall have to leave it to
you.... I dread ridicule; but I am sure you are too courteous&mdash;...
It required some courage for me to write to Lorient. But, if it
might possibly help my country&mdash;to risk ridicule&mdash;of course I
do not hesitate."</p>

<p>She looked uncertainly at the young man’s pleasant, serious face,
and, as though reassured:</p>

<p>"I shall have to tell you a little about myself first&mdash;so that
you may understand better."</p>

<p>"Please," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;my father and my only brother died a year ago, in battle....
It happened in the Argonne.... I am alone. We had maintained only
two men servants here. They went with their classes. One old woman
remains." She looked up with a forced smile. "I need not explain
to you that our circumstances are much straitened. You have only
to look about you to see that ... our poverty is not recent; it
always has been so within my memory&mdash;only growing a little worse
every year. I believe our misfortunes began during the Vendée....
But that is of no interest ... except that&mdash;through coincidence,
of course&mdash;every time a new misfortune comes upon our family,
misfortune also falls on France." He nodded, still mystified,
but interested.</p>

<p>"Did you happen to notice the device carved on the gatepost?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I thought it resembled a fish&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you understand French, Captain Neeland?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you know that L’Ombre means ’the shadow’."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you know, also, that there is a fish called ’L’Ombre’?"</p>

<p>"No; I did not know that."</p>

<p>"There is. It looks like a shadow in the water. L’Ombre does
not belong here in Brittany. It is a northern fish of high altitudes
where waters are icy and rapid and always tinctured with melted
snow ... would you accord me a little more patience, Monsieur,
if I seem to be garrulous concerning my own family? It is merely
because I want you to understand everything ... <em>everything</em>...."</p>

<p>"I am interested," he assured her pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;it is a legend&mdash;perhaps a superstition in our family&mdash;that
any misfortune to us&mdash;<em>and to France</em>&mdash;is always preceded
by two invariable omens. One of these dreaded signs is the abrupt
appearance of L’Ombre in the waters of our moat&mdash;" She turned
her head slowly and looked down over the parapet of the bridge.&mdash;"The
other omen," she continued quietly, "is that the clocks in our
house suddenly go wrong&mdash;all striking the same hour, no matter
where the hands point, no matter what time it really is.... These
things have always happened in our family, they say. I, myself,
have never before witnessed them. But during the Vendée the clocks
persisted in striking four times every hour. The Comte d’Aulnes
mounted the scaffold at that hour; the Vicomte died under Charette
at Fontenay at that hour.... L’Ombre appeared in the waters of
the moat at four o’clock one afternoon. And then the clocks went
wrong.</p>

<p>"And all this happened again, they say, in 1870. L’Ombre appeared
in the moat. Every clock continued to strike six, day after day
for a whole week, until the battle of Sedan ended.... My grandfather
died there with the light cavalry.... I am so afraid I am taxing
your courtesy, Captain Neeland&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I am intensely interested," he repeated, watching the lovely,
sensitive face which pride and dread of misinterpretation had
slightly flushed again.</p>

<p>"It is only to explain&mdash;perhaps to justify myself for writing&mdash;for
asking that an officer be sent here from Lorient for a few days&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I understand, Countess."</p>

<p>"Thank you.... Had it been merely for myself&mdash;for my own fears&mdash;my
personal safety, I should not have written. But our misfortunes
seem to be coincident with my country’s mishaps.... So I thought&mdash;if
they sent an officer who would be kind enough to understand&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I understand ... L’Ombre has appeared in the moat again, has
it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it came a week ago, suddenly, at five o’clock in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the clocks?"</p>

<p>"For a week they have been all wrong."</p>

<p>"What hour do they strike?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Five."</p>

<p>"No matter where the hands point?"</p>

<p>"No matter. I have tried to regulate them. I have done everything
I could do. But they continue to strike five every hour of the
day and night.... I have"&mdash;a pale smile touched her lips&mdash;"I have
been a little wakeful&mdash;perhaps a trifle uneasy&mdash;on my country’s
account. You understand...." Pride and courage had permitted her
no more than uneasiness, it seemed. Or if fear had threatened
her there in her lonely bedroom through the still watches of the
night, she desired him to understand that her solicitude was for
France, not for any daughter of the race whose name she bore.</p>

<p>The simplicity and directness of her amazing narrative had held
his respect and attention; there could be no doubt that she implicitly
believed what she told him.</p>

<p>But that was one thing; and the wild extravagance of the story
was another. There must be, of course, an explanation for these
phenomena other than a supernatural one. Such things do not happen
except in medieval romance and tales of sorcery and doom. And
of all regions on earth Brittany swarms with such tales and superstitions.
He knew it. And this young girl was Bretonne after all, however
educated, however accomplished, however honest and modern and
sincere. And he began to comprehend that the germs of superstition
and credulity were in the blood of every Breton ever born.</p>

<p>But he merely said with pleasant deference: "I can very easily
understand your uneasiness and perplexity, Madame. It is a time
of mental stress, of great nervous tension in France&mdash;of heart-racking
suspense&#11834;"</p>

<p>She lifted her dark eyes. "You do not believe me, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"I believe what you have told me. But I believe, also, that there
is a natural explanation concerning these matters."</p>

<p>"I tell myself so, too.... But I brood over them in vain; I can
find no explanation."</p>

<p>"Of course there must be one," he insisted carelessly. "Is there
anything in the world more likely to go queer than a clock?"</p>

<p>"There are five clocks in the house. Why should they all go wrong
at the same time and in the same manner?"</p>

<p>He smiled. "I don’t know," he said frankly. "I’ll investigate,
if you will permit me."</p>

<p>"Of course.... And, about L’Ombre. What could explain its presence
in the moat? It is a creature of icy waters; it is extremely limited
in its range. My father has often said that, except L’Ombre which
has appeared at long intervals in our moat, L’Ombre never has
been seen in Brittany."</p>

<p>"From where does this clear water come which fills the moat?"
he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"From living springs in the bottom."</p>

<p>"No doubt," he said cheerfully, "a long subterranean vein of
water connects these springs with some distant Alpine river, somewhere&mdash;in
the Pyrenees, perhaps&mdash;" He hesitated, for the explanation seemed
as far-fetched as the water.</p>

<p>Perhaps it so appeared to her, for she remained politely silent.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the house, a clock struck five times. They both
sat listening intently. From the depths of the ancient mansion,
the other clocks repeated the strokes, first one, then another,
then two sounding their clear little bells almost in unison. All
struck five. He drew out his watch and looked at it. The hour
was three in the afternoon.</p>

<p>After a moment her attitude, a trifle rigid, relaxed. He muttered
something about making an examination of the clocks, adding that
to adjust and regulate them would be a simple matter.</p>

<p>She sat very still beside him on the stone coping&mdash;her dark eyes
wandered toward the forest&mdash;wonderful eyes, dreamily preoccupied&mdash;the
visionary eyes of a Bretonne, full of the mystery and beauty of
magic things unseen.</p>

<p>Venturing, at last, to disturb the delicate sequence of her thoughts:
"Madame," he said, "have you heard any rumours concerning enemy
airships&mdash;or, undersea boats?"</p>

<p>The tranquil gaze returned, rested on him: "No, but something
has been happening in the Aulnes Étang."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know. But every day the wild ducks rise from it in fright&mdash;clouds
of them&mdash;and the curlew and lapwings fill the sky with their clamour."</p>

<p>"A poacher?"</p>

<p>"I know of none remaining here in Finistère."</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything in the sky? An eagle?"</p>

<p>"Only the wild fowl whirling above the <em>étang</em>."</p>

<p>"You have heard nothing&mdash;from the clouds?"</p>

<p>"Only the <em>vanneaux</em> complaining and the wild curlew answering."</p>

<p>"Where is L’Ombre?" he asked, vaguely troubled.</p>

<p>She rose; he followed her across the bridge and along the mossy
border of the moat. Presently she stood still and pointed down
in silence.</p>

<p>For a while he saw nothing in the moat; then, suspended midway
between surface and bottom, motionless in the transparent water,
a shadow, hanging there, colourless, translucent&mdash;a phantom vaguely
detached from the limpid element through which it loomed.</p>

<p>L’Ombre lay very still in the silvery-grey depths where the glass
of the stream reflected the façade of that ancient house.</p>

<p>Around the angle of the moat crept a ripple; a rat appeared,
swimming, and, seeing them, dived. L’Ombre never stirred.</p>

<p>An involuntary shudder passed over Neeland, and he looked up
abruptly with the instinct of a creature suddenly trapped&mdash;but
not yet quite realizing it.</p>

<p>In the grey forest walling that silent place, in the monotonous
sky overhead, there seemed something indefinitely menacing; a
menace, too, in the intense stillness; and, in the twisted, uplifted
limbs of every giant tree, a subtle and suspended threat.</p>

<p>He said tritely and with an effort: "For everything there are
natural causes. These may always be discovered with ingenuity
and persistence.... Shall we examine your clocks, Madame?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Will your General be annoyed because I have asked that
an officer be sent here? Tell me truthfully, are <em>you</em>
annoyed?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," he insisted, striving to smile away the inexplicable
sense of depression which was creeping over him.</p>

<p>He looked down again at the grey wraith in the water, then, as
they turned and walked slowly back across the bridge together,
he said, suddenly:</p>

<p>"<em>Something</em> is wrong somewhere in Finistère. That is
evident to me. There have been too many rumours from too many
sources. By sea and land they come&mdash;rumours of things half seen,
half heard&mdash;glimpses of enemy aircraft, sea-craft. Yet their presence
would appear to be an impossibility in the light of the military
intelligence which we possess.</p>

<p>"But we have investigated every rumour; although I, personally,
know of no report which has been confirmed. Nevertheless, these
rumours persist; they come thicker and faster day by day. But
this&mdash;" He hesitated, then smiled&mdash;"this seems rather different&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know. I realize that I have invited ridicule&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Countess&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You are too considerate to say so.... And perhaps I have become
nervous&mdash;imagining things. It might easily be so. Perhaps it is
the sadness of the past year&mdash;the strangeness of it, and&#11834;"</p>

<p>She sighed unconsciously.</p>

<p>"It is lonely in the Wood of Aulnes," she said.</p>

<p>"Indeed it must be very lonely here," he returned in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes.... Aulnes Wood is&mdash;too remote for them to send our wounded
here for their convalescence. I offered Aulnes. Then I offered
myself, saying that I was ready to go anywhere if I might be of
use. It seems there are already too many volunteers. They take
only the trained in hospitals. I am untrained, and they have no
leisure to teach ... nobody wanted me."</p>

<p>She turned and gazed dreamily at the forest.</p>

<p>"So there is nothing for me to do," she said, "except to remain
here and sew for the hospitals." ... She looked out thoughtfully
across the fern-grown <em>carrefour</em>: "Therefore I sew all
day by the latticed window there&mdash;all day long, day after day&mdash;and
when one is young and when there is nobody&mdash;nothing to look at
except the curlew flying&mdash;nothing to hear except the <em>vanneaux</em>,
and the clocks striking the hour&#11834;"</p>

<p>Her voice had altered subtly, but she lifted her proud little
head and smiled, and her tone grew firm again:</p>

<p>"You see, Monsieur, I am truly becoming a trifle morbid. It is
entirely physical; my heart is quite undaunted."</p>

<p>"You heart, Madame, is but a part of the great, undaunted heart
of France."</p>

<p>"Yes ... therefore there could be no fear&mdash;no doubt of God....
Affairs go well with France, Monsieur?&mdash;may I ask without military
impropriety?"</p>

<p>"France, as always, faces her destiny, Madame. And her destiny
is victory and light."</p>

<p>"Surely ... I knew; only I had heard nothing for so long....
Thank you, Monsieur."</p>

<p>He said quietly: "The Light shall break. We must not doubt it,
we English. Nor can you doubt the ultimate end of this vast and
hellish Darkness which has been let loose upon the world to assail
it. You shall live to see light, Madame&mdash;and I also shall see
it&mdash;perhaps&#11834;"</p>

<p>She looked up at the young man, met his eyes, and looked elsewhere,
gravely. A slight flush lingered on her cheeks.</p>

<p>On the doorstep of the house they paused. "Is it possible," she
asked, "that an enemy aëroplane could land in the Aulnes Étang?
&mdash;L’Étang aux Vanneaux?"</p>

<p>"In the Étang?" he repeated, a little startled. "How large is
it, this Étang aux Vanneaux?"</p>

<p>"It is a lake. It is perhaps a mile long and three-quarters of
a mile across. My old servant, Anne, had seen the werewolf in
the reeds&mdash;like a man without a face&mdash;and only two great eyes&mdash;"
She forced a pale smile. "Of course, if it were anything she saw,
it was a real man.... And, airmen dress that way.... I wondered&#11834;"</p>

<p>He stood looking at her absently, worrying his short mustache.</p>

<p>"One of the rumours we have heard," he began, "concerns a supposed
invasion by a huge fleet of German battle-planes of enormous dimensions&mdash;a
new biplane type which is steered from the bridge like an ocean
steamer.</p>

<p>"It is supposed to be three or four times as large as their usual
<em>Albatross</em> type, with a vast cruising radius, immense
capacity for lifting, and powerful enough to carry a great weight
of armour, equipment, munitions, and a very large crew.</p>

<p>"And the most disturbing thing about it is that it is said to
be as noiseless as a high-class automobile."</p>

<p>"Has such an one been seen in Brittany?"</p>

<p>"Such a machine has been reported&mdash;many, many times&mdash;as though
not one but hundreds were in Finistère. And, what is very disquieting
to us&mdash;a report has arrived from a distant and totally independent
source&mdash;from Sweden&mdash;that air-crafts of this general type have
been secretly built in Germany by the hundreds."</p>

<p>After a moment’s silence she stepped into the house; he followed.</p>

<p>The great, bare, grey rooms were in keeping with the grey exterior;
age had more than softened and coördinated the ancient furnishings,
it had rendered them colourless, without accent, making the place
empty and monotonous.</p>

<p>Her chair and workbasket stood by a latticed window; she seated
herself and took up her sewing, watching him where he stood before
the fireplace fussing over a little mantel clock&mdash;a gilt and ebony
affair of the consulate, shaped like a lyre, the pendulum being
also the clock itself and containing the works, bell and dial.</p>

<p>When he had adjusted it to his satisfaction he tested it. It
still struck five. He continued to fuss over it for half an hour,
testing it at intervals, but it always struck five times, and
finally he gave up his attempts with a shrug of annoyance.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> can’t do anything with it," he admitted, smiling
cheerfully across the room at her; "is there another clock on
this floor?"</p>

<p>She directed him; he went into an adjoining room where, on the
mantel, a modern enamelled clock was ticking busily. But after
a little while he gave up his tinkering; he could do nothing with
it; the bell persistently struck five. He returned to where she
sat sewing, admitting failure with a perplexed and uneasy smile;
and she rose and accompanied him through the house, where he tried,
in turn, every one of the other clocks.</p>

<p>When, at length, he realized that he could accomplish nothing
by altering their striking mechanism&mdash;that every clock in the
house persisted in striking five times no matter where the hands
were pointing, a sudden, odd, and inward rage possessed him to
hurl the clocks at the wall and stamp the last vestiges of mechanism
out of them.</p>

<p>As they returned together through the hushed and dusky house,
he caught glimpses of faded and depressing tapestries; of vast,
tarnished mirrors, through the dim depths of which their passing
figures moved like ghosts; of rusted stands of arms, and armoured
lay figures where cobwebs clotted the slitted visors and the frail
tatters of ancient faded banners drooped.</p>

<p>And he understood why any woman might believe in strange inexplicable
things here in the haunting stillness of this house where splendour
had turned to mould&mdash;where form had become effaced and colour
dimmed; where only the shadowy film of texture still remained,
and where even that was slowly yielding&mdash;under the attacks of
Time’s relentless mercenaries, moth and dust and rust.</p>
