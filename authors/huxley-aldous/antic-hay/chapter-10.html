<p>Mr. Boldero liked the idea of the Patent Small-Clothes. He liked
it immensely, he said, immensely.</p>

<p>"There’s money in it," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Boldero was a small dark man of about forty-five, active
as a bird and with a bird’s brown, beady eyes, a bird’s sharp
nose. He was always busy, always had twenty different irons in
the fire at once, was always fresh, clearheaded, never tired.
He was also always unpunctual, always untidy. He had no sense
of time or of order. But he got away with it, as he liked to say.
He delivered the goods—or rather the goods, in the convenient
form of cash, delivered themselves, almost miraculously it always
seemed, to him.</p>

<p>He was like a bird in appearance. But in mind, Gumbril found,
after having seen him once or twice, he was like a caterpillar:
he ate all that was put before him, he consumed a hundred times
his own mental weight every day. Other people’s ideas, other people’s
knowledge—they were his food. He devoured them and they were at
once his own. All that belonged to other people he annexed without
a scruple or a second thought, quite naturally, as though it were
already his own. And he absorbed it so rapidly and completely,
he laid public claim to it so promptly that he sometimes deceived
people into believing that he had really anticipated them in their
ideas, that he had known for years and years the things they had
just been telling him, and which he would at once airily repeat
to them with the perfect assurance of one who knows—knows by instinct,
as it were, by inheritance.</p>

<p>At their first luncheon he had asked Gumbril to tell him all
about modern painting. Gumbril had given him a brief lecture;
before the savoury had appeared on the table, Mr. Boldero was
talking with perfect familiarity of Picasso and Derain. He almost
made it understood that he had a fine collection of their works
in his drawing-room at home. Being a trifle deaf, however, he
was not very good at names, and Gumbril’s all-too-tactful corrections
were lost on him. He could not be induced to abandon his Bacosso
in favour of any other version of the Spaniard’s name. Bacosso—why,
he had known all about Bacosso since he was a schoolboy! Bacosso
was an old master, already.</p>

<p>Mr. Boldero was very severe with the waiters and knew so well
how things ought to be done at a good restaurant, that Gumbril
felt sure he must recently have lunched with some meticulous gormandizer
of the old school. And when the waiter made as though to serve
them with brandy in small glasses, Mr. Boldero was so passionately
indignant that he sent for the manager.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me," he shouted in a perfect frenzy of righteous
anger, "that you don’t yet know how brandy ought to be drunk?"</p>

<p>Perhaps it was only last week that he himself, Gumbril reflected,
had learned to aerate his cognac in Gargantuan beakers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, of course, the Patent Small-Clothes were not neglected.
As soon as he had been told about the things, Mr. Boldero began
speaking of them with a perfect and practised familiarity. They
were already his, mentally his. And it was only Mr. Boldero’s
generosity that prevented him from making the Small-Clothes more
effectively his own.</p>

<p>"If it weren’t for the friendship and respect which I feel for
your father, Mr. Gumbril," he said, twinkling genially over the
brandy, "I’d just annex your Small-Clothes. Bag and baggage. Just
annex them."</p>

<p>"Ah, but they’re my patent," said Gumbril. "Or at least they’re
in process of being patented. The agents are at work."</p>

<p>Mr. Boldero laughed. "Do you suppose that would trouble me if
I wanted to be unscrupulous? I’d just take the idea and manufacture
the article. You’d bring an action. I’d have it defended with
all the professional erudition that could be brought. You’d find
yourself let in for a case that might cost thousands. And how
would you pay for it? You’d be forced to come to an agreement
out of court, Mr. Gumbril. That’s what you’d have to do. And a
damned bad agreement it would be for you, I can tell you." Mr.
Boldero laughed very cheerfully at the thought of the badness
of this agreement. "But don’t be alarmed," he said. "I shan’t
do it, you know."</p>

<p>Gumbril was not wholly reassured. Tactfully, he tried to find
out what terms Mr. Boldero was prepared to offer. Mr. Boldero
was nebulously vague.</p>

<p>They met again in Gumbril’s rooms. The contemporary drawings
on the walls reminded Mr. Boldero that he was now an art expert.
He told Gumbril all about it—in Gumbril’s own words. Every now
and then, it was true, Mr. Boldero made a little slip. Bacosso,
for example, remained unshakably Bacosso. But on the whole the
performance was most impressive. It made Gumbril feel very uncomfortable,
however, while it lasted. For he recognized in this characteristic
of Mr. Boldero a horrible caricature of himself. He too was an
assimilator; more discriminating, no doubt, more tactful, knowing
better than Mr. Boldero how to turn the assimilated experience
into something new and truly his own; but still a caterpillar,
definitely a caterpillar. He began studying Mr. Boldero with a
close and disgustful attention, as one might pore over some repulsive
<em>memento mori</em>.</p>

<p>It was a relief when Mr. Boldero stopped talking art and consented
to get down to business. Gumbril was wearing for the occasion
the sample pair of Small-Clothes which Mr. Bojanus had made for
him. For Mr. Boldero’s benefit he put them, so to speak, through
their paces. He allowed himself to drop with a bump on to the
floor—arriving there bruiseless and unjarred. He sat in complete
comfort for minutes at a stretch on the edge of the ornamental
iron fender. In the intervals he paraded up and down before Mr.
Boldero like a mannequin. "A trifle bulgy," said Mr. Boldero.
"But still...." He was, taking it all round, favourably impressed.
It was time, he said, to begin thinking of details. They would
have to begin by making experiments with the bladders to discover
a model combining, as Mr. Boldero put it, ‘maximum efficiency
with minimum bulge.’ When they had found the right thing, they
would have it made in suitable quantities by any good rubber firm.
As for the trousers themselves, they could rely for those on sweated
female labour in the East End. "Cheap and good," said Mr. Boldero.</p>

<p>"It sounds ideal," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>"And then," said Mr. Boldero, "there’s our advertising campaign.
On that I may say," he went on with a certain solemnity, "will
depend the failure or success of our enterprise. I consider it
of the first importance."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Gumbril, nodding importantly and with intelligence.</p>

<p>"We must set to work," said Mr. Boldero, "sci—en—tifically."
Gumbril nodded again.</p>

<p>"We have to appeal," Mr. Boldero went on so glibly that Gumbril
felt sure he must be quoting somebody else’s words, "to the great
instincts and feelings of humanity.... They are the sources of
action. They spend the money, if I may put it like that."</p>

<p>"That’s all very well," said Gumbril. "But how do you propose
to appeal to the most important of the instincts? I refer, as
you may well imagine, to sex."</p>

<p>"I was just going to come to that," said Mr. Boldero, raising
his hand as though to ask for a patient hearing. "Alas! we can’t.
I don’t see any way of hanging our Small-Clothes on the sexual
peg."</p>

<p>"Then we are undone," said Gumbril, too dramatically.</p>

<p>"No, no." Mr. Boldero was reassuring. "You make the error of
the Viennese. You exaggerate the importance of sex. After all,
my dear Mr. Gumbril, there is also the instinct of self-preservation;
there is also," he leaned forward, wagging his finger, "the social
instinct, the instinct of the herd."</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>"Both of them as powerful as sex. What are the Professor’s famous
Censors but forbidding suggestions from the herd without, made
powerful and entrenched by the social instinct within?"</p>

<p>Gumbril had no answer; Mr. Boldero continued, smiling:</p>

<p>"So that we shall be all right if we stick to self-preservation
and the herd. Rub in the comfort and the utility, the hygienic
virtues of our Small-Clothes; that will catch their self-preservatory
feelings. Aim at their dread of public opinion, at their ambition
to be one better than their fellows and their terror of being
different—at all the ludicrous weaknesses a well-developed social
instinct exposes them to. We shall get them, if we set to work
scientifically." Mr. Boldero’s bird-like eyes twinkled very brightly.
"We shall get them," he repeated, and he laughed a happy little
laugh, full of such a childlike diabolism, such an innocent gay
malignity that it seemed as though a little leprechaun had suddenly
taken the financier’s place in Gumbril’s best arm-chair.</p>

<p>Gumbril laughed too; for this leprechaunish mirth was infectious.
"We shall get them," he echoed. "Oh, I’m sure we shall, if you
set about it, Mr. Boldero."</p>

<p>Mr. Boldero acknowledged the compliment with a smile that expressed
no false humility. It was his due, and he knew it.</p>

<p>"I’ll give you some of my ideas about the advertising campaign,"
he said. "Just to give you a notion. You can think them over,
quietly, and make suggestions."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Gumbril, nodding.</p>

<p>Mr. Boldero cleared his throat. "We shall begin," he said, "by
making the most simple elementary appeal to their instinct of
self-preservation: we shall point out that the Patent Small-Clothes
are comfortable; that to wear them is to avoid pain. A few striking
slogans about comfort—that’s all we want. Very simple indeed.
It doesn’t take much to persuade a man that it’s pleasanter to
sit on air than on wood. But while we’re on the subject of hard
seats we shall have to glide off subtly at a tangent to make a
flank attack on the social instincts." And joining the tip of
his forefinger to the tip of his thumb, Mr. Boldero moved his
hand delicately sideways, as though he were sliding it along a
smooth brass rail. "We shall have to speak about the glories and
the trials of sedentary labour. We must exalt its spiritual dignity
and at the same time condemn its physical discomforts. ‘The seat
of honour,’ don’t you know. We could talk about that. ‘The Seats
of the Mighty.’ ‘The seat that rules the office rocks the world.’
All those lines might be made something of. And then we could
have little historical chats about thrones; how dignified, but
how uncomfortable they’ve been. We must make the bank clerk and
the civil servant feel proud of being what they are and at the
same time feel ashamed that, being such splendid people, they
should have to submit to the indignity of having blistered hind-quarters.
In modern advertising you must flatter your public—not in the
oily, abject, tradesmanlike style of the old advertisers, crawling
before clients who were their social superiors; that’s all over
now. It’s we who are the social superiors—because we’ve got more
money than the bank clerks and the civil servants. Our modern
flattery must be manly, straightforward, sincere, the admiration
of equal for equal—all the more flattering as we aren’t equals."
Mr. Boldero laid a finger to his nose. "They’re dirt and we’re
capitalists...." He laughed.</p>

<p>Gumbril laughed too. It was the first time that he had ever thought
of himself as a capitalist, and the thought was exhilarating.</p>

<p>"We flatter them," went on Mr. Boldero. "We say that honest work
is glorious and ennobling—which it isn’t; it’s merely dull and
cretinizing. And then we go on to suggest that it would be finer
still, more ennobling, because less uncomfortable, if they wore
Gumbril’s Patent Small-Clothes. You see the line?"</p>

<p>Gumbril saw the line.</p>

<p>"After that," said Mr. Boldero, "we get on to the medical side
of the matter. The medical side, Mr. Gumbril—that’s most important.
Nobody feels really well nowadays—at any rate, nobody who lives
in a big town and does the kind of loathsome work that the people
we’re catering for does. Keeping this fact before our eyes, we
have to make it clear that only those can expect to be healthy
who wear pneumatic trousers."</p>

<p>"That will be a little difficult, won’t it?" questioned Gumbril.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!" Mr. Boldero laughed with an infectious confidence.
"All we have to do is to talk about the great nerve centres of
the spine: the shocks they get when you sit down too hard; the
wearing exhaustion to which long-protracted sitting on unpadded
seats subjects them. We’ll have to talk very scientifically about
the great lumbar ganglia—if there are such things, which I really
don’t pretend to know. We’ll even talk almost mystically about
the ganglia. You know that sort of ganglion philosophy?" Mr. Boldero
went on parenthetically. "Very interesting it is, sometimes, I
think. We could put in a lot about the dark, powerful sense-life,
sex-life, instinct-life which is controlled by the lumbar ganglion.
How important it is that that shouldn’t be damaged. That already
our modern conditions of civilization tend unduly to develop the
intellect and the thoracic ganglia controlling the higher emotions.
That we’re wearing out, growing feeble, losing our balance in
consequence. And that the only cure—if we are to continue our
present mode of civilized life—is to be found in Gumbril’s Patent
Small-Clothes." Mr. Boldero brought his hand with an emphatic
smack on to the table as he spoke, as he fairly shouted, these
last words.</p>

<p>"Magnificent," said Gumbril, with genuine admiration.</p>

<p>"This sort of medical and philosophical dope," Mr. Boldero went
on, "is always very effective, if it’s properly used. The public
to whom we are making our appeal is, of course, almost absolutely
ignorant on these, or, indeed, on almost all other subjects. It
is therefore very much impressed by the unfamiliar words; particularly
if they have such a good juicy sound as the word ‘ganglia.’"</p>

<p>"There was a young man of East Anglia, whose loins were a tangle
of ganglia," murmured Gumbril, <em>improvisatore</em>.</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Mr. Boldero. "Precisely. You see how juicy
it is? Well, as I say, they’re impressed. And they’re also grateful.
They’re grateful to us for having given them a piece of abstruse,
unlikely information which they can pass on to their wives, or
to such friends as they know don’t read the paper in which our
advertisement appears—can pass on airily, don’t you know, with
easy erudition, as though they’d known all about ganglia from
their childhood. And they’ll feel such a flow of superiority as
they hand on the metaphysics and the pathology, that they’ll always
think of us with affection. They’ll buy our breeks and they’ll
get other people to buy. That’s why," Mr. Boldero went off again
on an instructive tangent, "that’s why the day of secret patent
medicines is really over. It’s no good saying you have rediscovered
some secret known only, in the past, to the Egyptians. People
don’t know anything about Egyptology; but they have an inkling
that such a science exists. And that if it does exist, it’s unlikely
that patent medicine makers should have found out facts unknown
to the professors at the universities. And it’s much the same
even with secrets that don’t come from Egypt. People know there’s
such a thing as medical science and they again feel it’s improbable
that manufacturers should know things ignored by the doctors.
The modern democratic advertiser is entirely above-board. He tells
you all about it. He explains that the digestive juices acting
on bismuth give rise to a disinfectant acid. He points out that
lactic ferment gets destroyed before it reaches the large intestine,
so that Metchnikoff’s cure generally won’t work. And he goes on
to explain that the only way of getting the ferment there is to
mix it with starch and paraffin: starch to feed the ferment on,
paraffin to prevent the starch being digested before it gets to
the intestine. And in consequence, he convinces you that a mixture
of starch, paraffin and ferment is the only thing that’s any good
at all. Consequently you buy it; which you would never have done
without the explanation. In the same way, Mr. Gumbril, we mustn’t
ask people to take our trousers on trust. We must explain scientifically
why these trousers will be good for their health. And by means
of the ganglia, as I’ve pointed out, we can even show that the
trousers will be good for their souls and the whole human race
at large. And as you probably know, Mr. Gumbril, there’s nothing
like a spiritual message to make things go. Combine spirituality
with practicality and you’ve fairly got them. Got them, I may
say, on toast. And that’s what we can do with our trousers; we
can put a message into them, a big, spiritual message. Decidedly,"
he concluded, "we shall have to work those ganglia all we can."</p>

<p>"I’ll undertake to do that," said Gumbril, who felt very buoyant
and self-assured. Mr. Boldero’s hydrogenous conversation had blown
him up like a balloon.</p>

<p>"And I’m sure you’ll do it well," said Mr. Boldero encouragingly.
"There is no better training for modern commerce than a literary
education. As a practical business man, I always uphold the ancient
universities, especially in their teaching of the Humanities."</p>

<p>Gumbril was much flattered. At the moment, it seemed supremely
satisfying to be told that he was likely to make a good business
man. The business man took on a radiance, began to glow, as it
were, with a phosphorescent splendour.</p>

<p>"Then it’s very important," continued Mr. Boldero, "to play on
their snobbism; to exploit that painful sense of inferiority which
the ignorant and ingenuous always feel in the presence of the
knowing. We’ve got to make our trousers the Thing—socially right
as well as merely personally comfortable. We’ve got to imply somehow
that it’s bad form not to wear them. We’ve got to make those who
don’t wear them feel rather uncomfortable. Like that film of Charlie
Chaplin’s, where he’s the absent-minded young man about town who
dresses for dinner immaculately, from the waist up—white waistcoat,
tail coat, stiff shirt, top-hat—and only discovers, when he gets
down into the hall of the hotel, that he’s forgotten to put on
his trousers. We’ve got to make them feel like that. That’s always
very successful. You know those excellent American advertisements
about young ladies whose engagements are broken off because they
perspire too freely or have an unpleasant breath? How horribly
uncomfortable those make you feel! We’ve got to do something of
the same sort for our trousers. Or more immediately applicable
would be those tailor’s advertisements about correct clothes.
‘Good clothes make you feel good.’ You know the sort of line.
And then those grave warning sentences in which you’re told that
a correctly cut suit may make the difference between an appointment
gained and an appointment lost, an interview granted and an interview
refused. But the most masterly examples I can think of," Mr. Boldero
went on with growing enthusiasm, "are those American advertisements
of spectacles, in which the manufacturers first assume the existence
of a social law about goggles, and then proceed to invoke all
the sanctions which fall on the head of the committer of a solecism
upon those who break it. It’s masterly. For sport or relaxation,
they tell you, as though it was a social axiom, you must wear
spectacles of pure tortoiseshell. For business, tortoiseshell
rims and nickel ear-pieces lend incisive poise—incisive poise,
we must remember that for our ads, Mr. Gumbril. ‘Gumbril’s Patent
Small-Clothes lend incisive poise to business men.’ For semi-evening
dress, shell rims with gold ear-pieces and gold nose-bridge. And
for full dress, gold-mounted rimless pince-nez are refinement
itself, and absolutely correct. Thus we see, a social law has
been created, according to which every self-respecting myope or
astigmat must have four distinct pairs of glasses. Think if he
should wear the all-shell sports model with full dress! Revolting
solecism! The people who read advertisements like that begin to
feel uncomfortable; they have only one pair of glasses, they are
afraid of being laughed at, thought low-class and ignorant and
suburban. And since there are few who would not rather be taken
in adultery than in provincialism, they rush out to buy four new
pairs of spectacles. And the manufacturer gets rich, Mr. Gumbril.
Now, we must do something of the kind with our trousers. Imply
somehow that they’re correct, that you’re undressed without, that
you’re fiancée would break off the engagement if she saw you sitting
down to dinner on anything but air." Mr. Boldero shrugged his
shoulders, vaguely waved his hand.</p>

<p>"It may be rather difficult," said Gumbril, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"It may," Mr. Boldero agreed. "But difficulties are made to be
overcome. We must pull the string of snobbery and shame: it’s
essential. We must find out methods for bringing the weight of
public opinion to bear mockingly on those who do not wear our
trousers. It is difficult at the moment to see how it can be done.
But it will have to be done, it will have to be done," Mr. Boldero
repeated emphatically. "We might even find a way of invoking patriotism
to our aid. ‘English trousers filled with English air, for English
men.’ A little far-fetched, perhaps. But there might be something
in it."</p>

<p>Gumbril shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, it’s one of the things we’ve got to think about in any
case," said Mr. Boldero. "We can’t afford to neglect such powerful
social emotions as these. Sex, as we’ve seen, is almost entirely
out of the question. We must run the rest, therefore, as hard
as we can. For instance, there’s the novelty business. People
feel superior if they possess something new which their neighbours
haven’t got. The mere fact of newness is an intoxication. We must
encourage that sense of superiority, brew up that intoxication.
The most absurd and futile objects can be sold because they’re
new. Not long ago I sold four million patent soap-dishes of a
new and peculiar kind. The point was that you didn’t screw the
fixture into the bathroom wall; you made a hole in the wall and
built the soap-dish into a niche, like a holy water stoup. My
soap-dishes possessed no advantages over other kinds of soap-dishes,
and they cost a fantastic amount to instal. But I managed to put
them across, simply because they were new. Four million of them."
Mr. Boldero smiled with satisfaction at the recollection. "We
shall do the same, I hope, with our trousers. People may be shy
of being the first to appear in them; but the shyness will be
compensated for by the sense of superiority and elation produced
by the consciousness of the newness of the things."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>"And then, of course, there’s the economy slogan. ‘One pair of
Gumbril’s Patent Small-Clothes will outlast six pairs of ordinary
trousers.’ That’s easy enough. So easy that it’s really uninteresting."
Mr. Boldero waved it away.</p>

<p>"We shall have to have pictures," said Gumbril, parenthetically.
He had an idea.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course."</p>

<p>"I believe I know of the very man to do them," Gumbril went on.
"His name’s Lypiatt. A painter. You’ve probably heard of him."</p>

<p>"Heard of him!" exclaimed Mr. Boldero. He laughed. "But who hasn’t
heard of Lydgate."</p>

<p>"Lypiatt."</p>

<p>"Lypgate, I mean, of course."</p>

<p>"I think he’d be the very man," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>"I’m certain he would," said Mr. Boldero, not a whit behind-hand.</p>

<p>Gumbril was pleased with himself. He felt he had done some one
a good turn. Poor old Lypiatt; be glad of the money. Gumbril remembered
also his own fiver. And remembering his own fiver, he also remembered
that Mr. Boldero had as yet made no concrete suggestion about
terms. He nerved himself at last to suggest to Mr. Boldero that
it was time to think of this little matter. Ah, how he hated talking
about money! He found it so hard to be firm in asserting his rights.
He was ashamed of showing himself grasping. He always thought
with consideration of the other person’s point of view—poor devil,
could he afford to pay? And he was always swindled and always
conscious of the fact. Lord, how he hated life on these occasions!
Mr. Boldero was still evasive.</p>

<p>"I’ll write you a letter about it," he said at last.</p>

<p>Gumbril was delighted. "Yes, do," he said enthusiastically, "do."
He knew how to cope with letters all right. He was a devil with
the fountain pen. It was these personal, hand-to-hand combats
that he couldn’t manage. He could have been, he always felt, such
a ruthless critic and satirist, such a violent, unscrupulous polemical
writer. And if ever he committed his autobiography to paper, how
breath-takingly intimate, how naked—naked without so much as a
healthy sunburn to colour the whiteness—how quiveringly a sensitive
jelly it would be! All the things he had never told any one would
be in it. Confession at long range—if anything, it would be rather
agreeable.</p>

<p>"Yes, do write me a letter," he repeated. "Do."</p>

<p>Mr. Boldero’s letter came at last, and the proposals it contained
were derisory. A hundred pounds down and five pounds a week when
the business should be started. Five pounds a week—and for that
he was to act as a managing director, writer of advertisements
and promoter of foreign sales. Gumbril felt thankful that Mr.
Boldero had put the terms in a letter. If they had been offered
point-blank across the luncheon table, he would probably have
accepted them without a murmur. He wrote a few neat, sharp phrases
saying that he could not consider less than five hundred pounds
down and a thousand a year. Mr. Boldero’s reply was amiable; would
Mr. Gumbril come and see him?</p>

<p>See him? Well, of course, it was inevitable. He would have to
see him again some time. But he would send the Complete Man to
deal with the fellow. A Complete Man matched with a leprechaun—there
could be no doubt as to the issue.</p>

<p>  "<em>DEAR MR. BOLDERO," </em>he wrote back, "I should have
come to talk over   matters before this. But I have been engaged
during the last days in   growing a beard and until this has come
to maturity, I cannot, as   you will easily be able to understand,
leave the house. By the day   after to-morrow, however, I hope
to be completely presentable and   shall come to see you at your
office at about three o’clock, if that   is convenient to you.
I hope we shall be able to arrange matters   satisfactorily.—Believe
me, dear Mr. Boldero, yours very truly,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>THEODORE GUMBRIL, JR</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>The day after to-morrow became in due course to-day; splendidly
bearded and Rabelaisianly broad in his whipcord toga, Gumbril
presented himself at Mr. Boldero’s office in Queen Victoria Street.</p>

<p>"I should hardly have recognized you," exclaimed Mr. Boldero
as he shook hands. "How it does alter you, to be sure!"</p>

<p>"Does it?" The Complete Man laughed with a significant joviality.</p>

<p>"Won’t you take off your coat?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said Gumbril. "I’ll keep it on."</p>

<p>"Well," said the leprechaun, leaning back in his chair and twinkling,
bird-like, across the table.</p>

<p>"Well," repeated Gumbril on a different tone from behind the
stooks of his corn-like beard. He smiled, feeling serenely strong
and safe.</p>

<p>"I’m sorry we should have disagreed," said Mr. Boldero.</p>

<p>"So am I," the Complete Man replied. "But we shan’t disagree
for long," he added, with significance; and as he spoke the words
he brought down his fist with such a bang, that the inkpots on
Mr. Boldero’s very solid mahogany writing-table trembled and the
pens danced, while Mr. Boldero himself started with a genuine
alarm. He had not expected them. And now he came to look at him
more closely, this young Gumbril was a great, hulking, dangerous-looking
fellow. He had thought he would be easy to manage. How could he
have made such a mistake?</p>

<p>Gumbril left the office with Mr. Boldero’s cheque for three hundred
and fifty pounds in his pocket and an annual income of eight hundred.
His bruised right hand was extremely tender to the touch. He was
thankful that a single blow had been enough. </p>
