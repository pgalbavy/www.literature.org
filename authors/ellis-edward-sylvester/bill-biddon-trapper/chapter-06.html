<p>For a moment we stood breathless, paralyzed and speechless. Then
our eyes sought each other with a look of fearful inquiry.</p>

<p>"Was that Biddon’s voice?" I asked, in a faint whisper.</p>

<p>"I don’t know. There it is again!"</p>

<p>And again came that wild, howling shriek of such agony as made
our blood curdle within us.</p>

<p>"<em>It is his voice!</em> Let us hasten to his aid," I exclaimed,
catching my rifle, and springing out. Nat followed closely, his
gun having been reloaded. The cry came from up the river and toward
it we dashed, scrambling and tearing through the brush and undergrowth,
like two maddened animals, heedless of what the consequence might
be. Several times we halted and listened, but heard nothing save
our own panting breasts and leaping hearts. On again we dashed,
looking hurriedly about us, until I knew we had ascended as high
as could be the author of that startling cry. Here we paused and
listened. No one was to be seen. I turned toward Nat, standing
behind me, and directly behind him I saw Biddon slowly approaching.</p>

<p>"What are you doin’ here?" he asked, as he came up.</p>

<p>"Was not that your voice which I just heard?"</p>

<p>"I rather reckon it wan’t. When you hear Bill Biddon bawl out
in that way, jist let me know, will yer?"</p>

<p>"What under the sun was it?" I asked then, greatly relieved.</p>

<p>"That’s more nor me can tell; but shoot and skin me, if I can’t
tell you one thing;" he approached closely and whispered, "there’s
sunkthin else nor reds about yer."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked, although I understood well enough
what he meant.</p>

<p>"I’s here once afore, as I told yer, and I never heerd sich goin’s
on then. I’ve seed the tracks of moccasins all about the traps,
but can’t draw bead on the shadder of a redskin."</p>

<p>"You heard that horrid howl, didn’t you?"</p>

<p>"Heerd it! I should think I did."</p>

<p>"Was it you who shot?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the way on it was this: I got on a purty plain trail and
follered it up hereabouts, when I cotched the glimpse of a Blackfoot’s
feather goin’ down through the bushes there, and blazed away at
him. I never missed a red in my life, and I didn’t miss him. Howsumever,
he didn’t mind it, but kept on and got away, and jist as he went
out of sight that orful yell come. It didn’t seem that he made
it, but sounded like as though ’twas all about me, above and under
the ground, and around and behind me."</p>

<p>"Anywhere near us?" asked Nat.</p>

<p>"It sounded jist under your feet about."</p>

<p>"Jerusha!" exclaimed the affrighted Nat, as he sprang nervously
toward me.</p>

<p>"It must have been the Indian, surely, who made that yell," said
I.</p>

<p>"In course; though things are beginnin’ to look qua’rish to me."</p>

<p>The same look of uneasiness again passed over the trapper’s face;
and I saw that although he strove to hide it, he was by no means
at rest. Matters were beginning to put on an unusual aspect, and
that was the reason. Give the trapper of the northwest flesh and
blood to contend against, let him know that nothing supernatural
is arrayed against him, and he is the last man in the world to
yield an inch. But the moment he sees something unexplainable
to his simple mind, (and the trapper is a credulous being), his
courage deserts him. He believes that other spirits than those
of men visit this earth, and they are his greatest horror.</p>

<p>"Les’ go home; there’s Injins all around us," pleaded Nat.</p>

<p>"How’d you know?"</p>

<p>"Because I <em>seen</em> one myself."</p>

<p>Biddon looked inquiringly at me, and, deeming it best, I related
the incident given in the preceding chapter. I saw at once his
uneasiness was increased.</p>

<p>"Why didn’t you shoot the redskin?" he angrily asked of Nat.</p>

<p>"Why didn’t <em>you</em> shoot the redskin?" queried Nat, in
turn.</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;hit him fair and square as I ever hit anything."</p>

<p>"But didn’t do any more good than I did."</p>

<p>"I made the infarnal imp howl."</p>

<p>"And I made mine <em>grunt</em>," added Nat, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"There is no need of words," I interposed. "Each of you did your
best, Nat included. You, Bill, I believe, hit your man and mortally
wounded him. That yell was of agony, though I can’t conceive how
we came to mistake it for yours. The dead or dying body of that
Indian, I believe, is near at hand. See! what does that mean?"
I asked, as I detected some red fluid dripping from the limb of
a bush to the earth. The trapper stepped forward and looked at
it.</p>

<p>"That’s the blood of a Blackfoot, or I’m a skinned beaver!" he
remarked, with a glow of relief at having those strange apprehensions
of his removed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I’m convinced that’s Injin blood," added Nat, rubbing it
between the tip of his finger and thumb. "The blood of a Blackfoot
Injin, too&mdash;a man’s about thirty-two years old. Probably a brother
to the one I frightened."</p>

<p>"What do you know about that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! it’s only a supposition of mine."</p>

<p>"Biddon, I believe, as I just said, that we will find the body
of that savage near at hand. Let us follow it."</p>

<p>"Jes’ what I’s agoin’ to do," he replied, starting off at once
upon the trail.</p>

<p>It was easy to follow, as every step was marked by blood, which,
in many places, was dripping from the bushes to the ground. It
was followed but a short distance, however, as it led in a direct
line to the river.</p>

<p>"It’s as I s’pected," said Biddon, turning round in disgust.</p>

<p>"He must have drowned then."</p>

<p>"Dunno ’bout that. He’s taken to the water to hide his trail,
an’ jes’ as like as not some of the other painted heathen have
helped him off."</p>

<p>"No doubt about that. I’ve been thinking that some of them helped
off that fellow when I was loading my gun."</p>

<p>"We mought as well go back agin," said Biddon. "I’m tired of
huntin’ spirits, and I dunno but what we’d better move traps and
leave this plagued place to ’em."</p>

<p>"That’s what I am in favor of&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nat suddenly paused, for Biddon, with a slight "sh" motioned
us down. We both sank quickly and silently to the earth, while
he, in a crouching position, gazed stealthily up-stream.</p>

<p>"What is it, Bill?" whispered Nat.</p>

<p>"<em>There’s a canoe comin’ down stream!</em>"</p>

<p>We said nothing; and Nat looking meaningly in the water.</p>

<p>"Skin me, if there ain’t two reds and a squaw in it," added Biddon,
without changing his position, or removing his gaze.</p>

<p>I could not restrain the singular agitation that came over me
at this announcement. Fearing to betray myself, I cautiously arose
beside Biddon.</p>

<p>"Let me take a look," I whispered.</p>

<p>"Be keerful you ain’t seen," he whispered, in turn, as he stepped
back.</p>

<p>As I looked, I saw, not more than two hundred yards distant the
canoe approaching, heading directly towards us. For this reason,
I could only see the foremost Indian, though I was positive another,
together with the white captive, were in it. I gazed but a moment
and then looked inquiringly at the trapper. He made no reply,
but again peered forth.</p>

<p>"That ain’t a squaw; it’s a white gal," said he, looking round
upon us with an astounded look.</p>

<p>"Shall we rescue her?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ef she wants us to, in course."</p>

<p>"You going to shoot them?" asked Nat, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Can’t tell yit. Jest see that yer irons is ready, and we’ll
wait till they get out yer. Don’t make no noise till I give the
motion."</p>

<p>The trapper stole a yard or two in front of us, where he sank
softly down upon his face until only his head was visible. Nat
fingered his gun nervously beside me, while I, not a whit less
agitated, waited for the canoe to appear through the interstices
of the bushes in front.</p>

<p>In a moment, I heard the faint ripple of an oar, and saw the
trapper slowly raising his head and bringing his rifle in front
of him. He raised his hand warningly for us to remain quiet until
the moment should arrive. I heard the click of my companion’s
gun, as he raised the hammer, and admonished him to be careful.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I saw the red head-dress of one of the savages glittering
through the bushes, and, before I could speak, came an explosion
beside me like the crash of a thunderbolt. Almost simultaneously,
the herculean frame of the trapper bounded over me, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Who fired that? I’m shot."</p>

<p>Nat and I sprang to our feet and dashed after him; but as I turned,
though bewildered with excitement, I looked at the spot where
the canoe was seen. It was gone!</p>

<p>We dashed up the bank, and in a moment reached Biddon. The excitement
had completely gone, and he stood coolly feeling his ear.</p>

<p>"Was that your gun, Jarsey?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir; mine is still loaded."</p>

<p>"How is yours, Greeny?"</p>

<p>Nat lifted his, examined the lock and looked into the barrel.
He had indeed discharged it, grazing the trapper’s head so closely
as to wound his ear.</p>

<p>"Wonder if that was my gun? Sure, I believe it was," he remarked,
still looking into the barrel.</p>

<p>"Was it your gun?" repeated the trapper, his brow darkening like
a thunder-cloud, and laying his hand upon his knife-handle, as
he approached. Nat looked up and started as he saw his visage
fairly gleaming with passion.</p>

<p>"I didn’t shoot it, Bill, by thunder!" he expostulated.</p>

<p>The face of the trapper changed. It grew paler, and the dark
cloud fled from it. He replaced his drawn knife. He believed the
words of Nat.</p>

<p>Matters were approaching a crisis. The recent startling events
had their effect upon us all. The trapper avowed he could not
stand "sich goin’s on," and should leave for some other quarters.
Little sleep came to Nat at night. His adventure with the savage,
and the more recent occurrence alarmed him. He had discovered
that there were consequences to be feared from both sides.</p>

<p>I was still unwilling to believe that there was anything in the
events given which would not soon be explained. It was evident
our foes were around, and from some inexplicable cause, had pursued
an unusual course toward us. We had all been exposed to their
power, and had yet escaped harmless. What was the meaning of this?
And, above all, what was the object of the appearance and disappearance
of the canoe at the different times mentioned? Who could be that
fair being of whose existence I only was as yet aware?</p>

<p>These questions, prompted only my anxious curiosity and desire
to learn more of that mysterious being whom I had now twice seen.
I ridiculed the ideas of Biddon, and Nat strove hard to convince
him that he was not afraid. Biddon, consented to remain until
more was learned, intimating at the same time, that it must be
very soon. He visited the horses each day, and found them undisturbed.
This, however, only added to his anxiety. Had they been gone he
would have taken it as convincing evidence that <em>bona fide</em>
Indians were in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The next day, after the closing scene of the last chapter, Nat
agreed to accompany me for the last time to the spot where we
had seen the canoe. The trapper could not be prevailed upon to
go, affirming that he should probably have his hands full at home.
It required my utmost skill to succeed with Nat, as the horror
had plainly settled upon him.</p>

<p>"It’s awful!" said he, as we started, "this walking right into
danger, but I want to see that canoe agin, but especially that
gal, and so I’ll go."</p>

<p>"And, I trust, behave yourself. You well know, Nat, you fired
that shot which came so near ending Biddon’s life."</p>

<p>"Wonder if I did pull the trigger!" he exclaimed, suddenly stopping
and looking round at me.</p>

<p>"You <em>know</em> you did, and had he known it, too, it would
have been a sorry piece of business for you. That temper of his
is terrible, when it is once excited."</p>

<p>"I remember cocking my gun, and kind of pulling the trigger,
but I didn’t mean to pull hard enough to make it go off."</p>

<p>"I suppose not. I cannot conceive how Biddon persuaded himself
to believe that you did not discharge it when the case was self-evident.
But he is willing to believe almost anything since he has started."</p>

<p>"He shouldn’t have gotten before my gun, for he knows my hand
sometimes trembles."</p>

<p>"I trust you will be able to control it this time."</p>

<p>"No doubt of that; but, then, I’d advise you, as a friend, not
to get before me, especially if you see the canoe coming."</p>

<p>I assured him that I should not, and we kept upon our way. Upon
each of the occasions before, as near as I could judge, it was
about noon that the canoe made its appearance; and, as it was
that time now, we hurried forward, lest the opportunity should
pass. The opportunity, I say&mdash;for, although it had appeared but
twice as yet, I somehow or other was well satisfied we should
see it again.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Nat.</p>

<p>"It will depend upon what we see. If simply those two savages
with the captive, as we judge her to be, are in the canoe, and
no demonstration is made, I think it best not to attempt a rescue.
It is only a supposition of ours that she is a captive, and we
know not that she would thank us for interfering in her case."</p>

<p>In a short time we reached the elevation already mentioned. Here
we seated ourselves so as to remain concealed from any stragglers
in the vicinity, while we ourselves with a little care could detect
the slightest object passing. As I stooped, my hand came in contact
with something cold, and upon looking at it, I saw it covered
with dark clotted blood. I started, and wiped it on the grass,
but it sent a shudder through me to reflect that it had once been
the life-fluid of a human being.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" exclaimed Nat; "ain’t that awful?"</p>

<p>"It is disagreeable, to say the least."</p>

<p>"Just look at the blood on the grass, too, and all around. I
believe Bill must have hit a half-dozen Injins sure, the way things
appear here."</p>

<p>"He must have wounded one terribly to make him bleed like this."</p>

<p>"And if he had been a flesh and blood Injin he would have never
tramped in that manner. I tell you, William Relmond, there <em>is</em>
something more more than human about us. I can feel it in my bones,
and I’m of Biddon’s opinion that the sooner we get away from here
the better."</p>

<p>"Fudge! I see you are beginning to get alarmed."</p>

<p>"Oh no; you are mistaken. I am not frightened at all. For Biddon’s
sake, but more especially for yours, I am anxious. If you are
desirous of remaining hereabouts, and will take all the consequences,
I will make no objections."</p>

<p>"Of course, if I run into danger of my own accord, I expect that
I alone will suffer the penalty."</p>

<p>"Then we needn’t say anything more about it; you know we pledged
ourselves to remain true to each other, and I won’t desert you."</p>

<p>"That’s well spoken, Nat. The minute I am satisfied that our
lives are imperiled, I shall not be the means of prolonging that
peril a moment. It is only this great desire to solve and understand
the singular occurrences that are transpiring around us, that
leads me to still remain. I have determined that to-day we shall
all be satisfied."</p>

<p>"My curiosity is extraordinarily high; but I guess that gal has
as much to do with it as anything else. I’m determined to get
a glimpse of her face, and, if possible, whisper in her ear that
Nat Todd, from Maine, is about. I flatter myself that the minute
she knows that, she will jump overboard and make for shore without
saying a word to the chaps with her."</p>

<p>"The greatest difficulty, I fear, will be to convey your words
to the captive, without conveying it also to her captors."</p>

<p>"I swow, it would be harder than I thought at first."</p>

<p>During this conversation, which was carried on in a half-whisper,
Nat was constantly parting the bushes and peering through them,
while now and then I glanced expectantly up the stream; but nothing
as yet had rewarded our watchfulness. Suddenly I reflected that
as I had been twice defeated in observing the disappearance of
the canoe, from the exact spot upon which we were now seated,
that we might make a better arrangement of ourselves, so as to
insure this coveted knowledge to one of us at least.</p>

<p>I mentioned this to Nat.</p>

<p>"If one of us was on t’other side, the thing would be certain,
but that can’t be done very conveniently, and we shall have to
try something else."</p>

<p>"Suppose you go down stream about a hundred yards near the bend
yonder," I proposed to Nat.</p>

<p>"Guess I will!" he exclaimed, as he rose to go.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said I, detaining him. "Let me admonish you
to exercise no ordinary caution, Nat, for you have seen enough
to convince you that your own safety depends upon it. Remember
that a word or false movement, however slight, may defeat our
plans. Look out for danger to yourself, and not let your curiosity
be the means of your destruction. <em>Be very careful.</em>"</p>

<p>I know not what led me to thus warn him; but at the moment he
arose to go, an unaccountable sense of impending danger came over
me. It was not so much for me as for him I spoke thus. He promised
to heed my words and departed.</p>

<p>As soon as he had disappeared, I cast another look up stream,
but still there were no signs of the expected canoe, and a sudden
apprehension that I should not see it again came over me. There
was, in fact; as much reason not to expect it as to anticipate
its coming, and as I looked up at the sun and saw that it was
already beyond the hour, I was half-tempted to turn back. While
I was debating, I naturally looked up the river, and there, just
rounding the bend where the canoe had first come into view before,&mdash;and
there it was coming! Quivering with agitation, I sank upon the
ground, and gave a low whistle as a signal to Nat. He returned
it, as an evidence of his watchfulness.</p>

<p>I saw from that point where I was seated, the view would be most
obstructed when the canoe was nearest. Accordingly, I crept cautiously
and quickly nearer the water’s edge. This time, however, I slightly
varied my course, and concealed myself behind the trunk of a fallen
tree. This was within a yard of the water, and afforded complete
concealment. I noticed the log was rotten and apparently hollow.</p>

<p>Here I lay, and intently listened and watched. A few moments
and an almost inaudible ripple was heard, and the canoe was opposite.
I exercised the most extreme caution, and was fortunate enough
to obtain a perfect view of each of the occupants. They were the
same&mdash;the dark, malignant faces of the savages, and the fair features
of the captive. She sat in the stern, her hand resting gently
upon a guiding oar, and her gaze fixed upon the stream in front.
The canoe floated with the current, and not a paddle was stirred,
nor the least motion made by the beings before me. The headdress
of the captive was, as mentioned before, eagle feathers and porcupine
quills, while the dark, waving masses of hair hung low upon the
shoulders, contrasting with the whiteness of the face. A heavy
crimson shawl enveloped the form, as when first seen. The features
were regular, and, perhaps, in my state of feeling, their beauty
was considerably enhanced; but the thought came upon me that if
there were anything supernatural in my experience, it was in seeing
such wonderful beauty as was now before me.</p>

<p>Unconsciously I forgot myself as the canoe was gliding past,
and before I was aware, it was hid from view by intervening obstacles.
I withdrew hastily, intending to hurry farther down, where the
view would be more complete. I had taken but a step or two when
Nat’s rifle was discharged, and I heard distinctly a muffled sound
of his voice. Wild with agitation, I dashed to the spot where
I supposed him to be. The view of the river at this point was
clear, and I turned to look at the canoe. It had vanished!</p>

<p>I looked around for Nat, but he too, was gone. I called him,
and once thought I heard a faint answer. But it was not repeated,
and I could not tell its direction. I reached the ground, and
beheld <em>the tracks of others beside his own</em>. I awaited
until near night, but Nathan Todd was never to return.</p>
