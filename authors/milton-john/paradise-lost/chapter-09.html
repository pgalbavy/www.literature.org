<BR>
  Meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act <BR>
Of SATAN done in Paradise, and how <BR>
Hee in the Serpent had perverted EVE, <BR>
Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit, <BR>
Was known in Heav'n; for what can scape the Eye <BR>
Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart <BR>
Omniscient, who in all things wise and just, <BR>
Hinder'd not SATAN to attempt the minde <BR>
Of Man, with strength entire, and free Will arm'd, <BR>
Complete to have discover'd and repulst <BR>
Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend. <BR>
For still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd <BR>
The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit, <BR>
Whoever tempted; which they not obeying, <BR>
Incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie, <BR>
And manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall. <BR>
Up into Heav'n from Paradise in hast <BR>
Th' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad <BR>
For Man, for of his state by this they knew, <BR>
Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln <BR>
Entrance unseen.  Soon as th' unwelcome news <BR>
From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, displeas'd <BR>
All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare <BR>
That time Celestial visages, yet mixt <BR>
With pitie, violated not thir bliss. <BR>
About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes <BR>
Th' ethereal People ran, to hear and know <BR>
How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream <BR>
Accountable made haste to make appear <BR>
With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance, <BR>
And easily approv'd; when the most High <BR>
Eternal Father from his secret Cloud, <BR>
Amidst in Thunder utter'd thus his voice. <BR>
<BR>
  Assembl'd Angels, and ye Powers return'd <BR>
From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid, <BR>
Nor troubl'd at these tidings from the Earth, <BR>
Which your sincerest care could not prevent, <BR>
Foretold so lately what would come to pass, <BR>
When first this Tempter cross'd the Gulf from Hell. <BR>
I told ye then he should prevail and speed <BR>
On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc't <BR>
And flatter'd out of all, believing lies <BR>
Against his Maker; no Decree of mine <BR>
Concurring to necessitate his Fall, <BR>
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse <BR>
His free Will, to her own inclining left <BR>
In eevn scale.  But fall'n he is, and now <BR>
What rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass <BR>
On his transgression, Death denounc't that day, <BR>
Which he presumes already vain and void, <BR>
Because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd, <BR>
By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find <BR>
Forbearance no acquittance ere day end. <BR>
Justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd. <BR>
But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee <BR>
Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr'd <BR>
All Judgement, whether in Heav'n, or Earth; or Hell. <BR>
Easie it may be seen that I intend <BR>
Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee <BR>
Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design'd <BR>
Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie, <BR>
And destin'd Man himself to judge Man fall'n. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright <BR>
Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son <BR>
Blaz'd forth unclouded Deitie; he full <BR>
Resplendent all his Father manifest <BR>
Express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde. <BR>
<BR>
  Father Eternal, thine is to decree, <BR>
Mine both in Heav'n and Earth to do thy will <BR>
Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov'd <BR>
Mayst ever rest well pleas'd.  I go to judge <BR>
On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst, <BR>
Whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light, <BR>
When time shall be, for so I undertook <BR>
Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine <BR>
Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom <BR>
On me deriv'd, yet I shall temper so <BR>
Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most <BR>
Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. <BR>
Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none <BR>
Are to behold the Judgement, but the judg'd, <BR>
Those two; the third best absent is condemn'd, <BR>
Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law <BR>
Conviction to the Serpent none belongs. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose <BR>
Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers, <BR>
Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant <BR>
Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence <BR>
EDEN and all the Coast in prospect lay. <BR>
Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods <BR>
Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd. <BR>
Now was the Sun in Western cadence low <BR>
From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour <BR>
To fan the Earth now wak'd, and usher in <BR>
The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole <BR>
Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both <BR>
To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard <BR>
Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes <BR>
Brought to thir Ears, while day declin'd, they heard <BR>
And from his presence hid themselves among <BR>
The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God <BR>
Approaching, thus to ADAM call'd aloud. <BR>
<BR>
  Where art thou ADAM, wont with joy to meet <BR>
My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here, <BR>
Not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude, <BR>
Where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught: <BR>
Or come I less conspicuous, or what change <BR>
Absents thee, or what chance detains?  Come forth. <BR>
He came, and with him EVE, more loth, though first <BR>
To offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd; <BR>
Love was not in thir looks, either to God <BR>
Or to each other, but apparent guilt, <BR>
And shame, and perturbation, and despaire, <BR>
Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. <BR>
Whence ADAM faultring long, thus answer'd brief. <BR>
<BR>
  I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice <BR>
Affraid, being naked, hid my self.  To whom <BR>
The gracious Judge without revile repli'd. <BR>
<BR>
  My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd, <BR>
But still rejoyc't, how is it now become <BR>
So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who <BR>
Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree <BR>
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus ADAM sore beset repli'd. <BR>
O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand <BR>
Before my Judge, either to undergoe <BR>
My self the total Crime, or to accuse <BR>
My other self, the partner of my life; <BR>
Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines, <BR>
I should conceal, and not expose to blame <BR>
By my complaint; but strict necessitie <BR>
Subdues me, and calamitous constraint, <BR>
Least on my head both sin and punishment, <BR>
However insupportable, be all <BR>
Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou <BR>
Wouldst easily detect what I conceale. <BR>
This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help, <BR>
And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good, <BR>
So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, <BR>
That from her hand I could suspect no ill, <BR>
And what she did, whatever in it self, <BR>
Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed; <BR>
Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd. <BR>
Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey <BR>
Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, <BR>
Superior, or but equal, that to her <BR>
Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place <BR>
Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, <BR>
And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd <BR>
Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd <BR>
She was indeed, and lovely to attract <BR>
Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts <BR>
Were such as under Government well seem'd, <BR>
Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part <BR>
And person, had'st thou known thy self aright. <BR>
<BR>
  So having said, he thus to EVE in few: <BR>
Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done? <BR>
<BR>
  To whom sad EVE with shame nigh overwhelm'd, <BR>
Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge <BR>
Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd. <BR>
<BR>
  The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate. <BR>
<BR>
  Which when the Lord God heard, without delay <BR>
To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd <BR>
Serpent though brute, unable to transferre <BR>
The Guilt on him who made him instrument <BR>
Of mischief, and polluted from the end <BR>
Of his Creation; justly then accurst, <BR>
As vitiated in Nature: more to know <BR>
Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew) <BR>
Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last <BR>
To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd, <BR>
Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best: <BR>
And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. <BR>
<BR>
  Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst <BR>
Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field; <BR>
Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, <BR>
And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life. <BR>
Between Thee and the Woman I will put <BR>
Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; <BR>
Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd <BR>
When JESUS son of MARY second EVE, <BR>
Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n, <BR>
Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave <BR>
Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht <BR>
In open shew, and with ascention bright <BR>
Captivity led captive through the Aire, <BR>
The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt, <BR>
Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; <BR>
Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, <BR>
And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie <BR>
By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring <BR>
In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will <BR>
Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. <BR>
<BR>
  On ADAM last thus judgement he pronounc'd. <BR>
Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife, <BR>
And eaten of the Tree concerning which <BR>
I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, <BR>
Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow <BR>
Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; <BR>
Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth <BR>
Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field, <BR>
In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread, <BR>
Till thou return unto the ground, for thou <BR>
Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, <BR>
For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. <BR>
<BR>
   So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, <BR>
And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day <BR>
Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood <BR>
Before him naked to the aire, that now <BR>
Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin <BR>
Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume, <BR>
As when he wash'd his servants feet, so now <BR>
As Father of his Familie he clad <BR>
Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, <BR>
Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid; <BR>
And thought not much to cloath his Enemies: <BR>
Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins <BR>
Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more <BR>
Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness, <BR>
Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight. <BR>
To him with swift ascent he up returnd, <BR>
Into his blissful bosom reassum'd <BR>
In glory as of old, to him appeas'd <BR>
All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man <BR>
Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. <BR>
Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth, <BR>
Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, <BR>
In counterview within the Gates, that now <BR>
Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame <BR>
Farr into CHAOS, since the Fiend pass'd through, <BR>
Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. <BR>
<BR>
  O Son, why sit we here each other viewing <BR>
Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives <BR>
In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides <BR>
For us his ofspring deare?  It cannot be <BR>
But that success attends him; if mishap, <BR>
Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n <BR>
By his Avenger, since no place like this <BR>
Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. <BR>
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, <BR>
Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large <BR>
Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, <BR>
Or sympathie, or som connatural force <BR>
Powerful at greatest distance to unite <BR>
With secret amity things of like kinde <BR>
By secretest conveyance.  Thou my Shade <BR>
Inseparable must with mee along: <BR>
For Death from Sin no power can separate. <BR>
But least the difficultie of passing back <BR>
Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe <BR>
Impassable, impervious, let us try <BR>
Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine <BR>
Not unagreeable, to found a path <BR>
Over this Maine from Hell to that new World <BR>
Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument <BR>
Of merit high to all th' infernal Host, <BR>
Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, <BR>
Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. <BR>
Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn <BR>
By this new felt attraction and instinct. <BR>
<BR>
  Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. <BR>
Goe whither Fate and inclination strong <BR>
Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre <BR>
The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw <BR>
Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste <BR>
The savour of Death from all things there that live: <BR>
Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest <BR>
Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. <BR>
<BR>
  So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell <BR>
Of mortal change on Earth.  As when a flock <BR>
Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, <BR>
Against the day of Battel, to a Field, <BR>
Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd <BR>
With sent of living Carcasses design'd <BR>
For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. <BR>
So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd <BR>
His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, <BR>
Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr. <BR>
Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste <BR>
Wide Anarchie of CHAOS damp and dark <BR>
Flew divers, &amp; with Power (thir Power was great) <BR>
Hovering upon the Waters; what they met <BR>
Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea <BR>
Tost up and down, together crowded drove <BR>
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. <BR>
As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse <BR>
Upon the CRONIAN Sea, together drive <BR>
Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way <BR>
Beyond PETSORA Eastward, to the rich <BR>
CATHAIAN Coast.  The aggregated Soyle <BR>
Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, <BR>
As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm <BR>
As DELOS floating once; the rest his look <BR>
Bound with GORGONIAN rigor not to move, <BR>
And with ASPHALTIC slime; broad as the Gate, <BR>
Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach <BR>
They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on <BR>
Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge <BR>
Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall <BR>
Immoveable of this now fenceless world <BR>
Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, <BR>
Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. <BR>
So, if great things to small may be compar'd, <BR>
XERXES, the Libertie of GREECE to yoke, <BR>
From SUSA his MEMNONIAN Palace high <BR>
Came to the Sea, and over HELLESPONT <BR>
Bridging his way, EUROPE with ASIA joyn'd, <BR>
And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves. <BR>
Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art <BR>
Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock <BR>
Over the vext Abyss, following the track <BR>
Of SATAN, to the selfsame place where hee <BR>
First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe <BR>
From out of CHAOS to the outside bare <BR>
Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant <BR>
And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made <BR>
And durable; and now in little space <BR>
The Confines met of Empyrean Heav'n <BR>
And of this World, and on the left hand Hell <BR>
With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes <BR>
In sight, to each of these three places led. <BR>
And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd, <BR>
To Paradise first tending, when behold <BR>
SATAN in likeness of an Angel bright <BR>
Betwixt the CENTAURE and the SCORPION stearing <BR>
His ZENITH, while the Sun in ARIES rose: <BR>
Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear <BR>
Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise. <BR>
Hee, after EVE seduc't, unminded slunk <BR>
Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape <BR>
To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act <BR>
By EVE, though all unweeting, seconded <BR>
Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought <BR>
Vain covertures; but when he saw descend <BR>
The Son of God to judge them, terrifi'd <BR>
Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun <BR>
The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth <BR>
Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd <BR>
By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire <BR>
Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, <BR>
Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood <BR>
Not instant, but of future time.  With joy <BR>
And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd, <BR>
And at the brink of CHAOS, neer the foot <BR>
Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't <BR>
Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear. <BR>
Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight <BR>
Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd. <BR>
Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire <BR>
Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. <BR>
<BR>
  O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, <BR>
Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own, <BR>
Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: <BR>
For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd, <BR>
My Heart, which by a secret harmonie <BR>
Still moves with thine, joyn'd in connexion sweet, <BR>
That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks <BR>
Now also evidence, but straight I felt <BR>
Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt <BR>
That I must after thee with this thy Son; <BR>
Such fatal consequence unites us three: <BR>
Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, <BR>
Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure <BR>
Detain from following thy illustrious track. <BR>
Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd <BR>
Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow'rd <BR>
To fortifie thus farr, and overlay <BR>
With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. <BR>
Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won <BR>
What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd <BR>
With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd <BR>
Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, <BR>
There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, <BR>
As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World <BR>
Retiring, by his own doom alienated, <BR>
And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide <BR>
Of all things, parted by th' Empyreal bounds, <BR>
His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, <BR>
Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne. <BR>
<BR>
  Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. <BR>
Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, <BR>
High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race <BR>
Of SATAN (for I glorie in the name, <BR>
Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King) <BR>
Amply have merited of me, of all <BR>
Th' Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore <BR>
Triumphal with triumphal act have met, <BR>
Mine with this glorious Work, &amp; made one Realm <BR>
Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent <BR>
Of easie thorough-fare.  Therefore while I <BR>
Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease <BR>
To my associate Powers, them to acquaint <BR>
With these successes, and with them rejoyce, <BR>
You two this way, among those numerous Orbs <BR>
All yours, right down to Paradise descend; <BR>
There dwell &amp; Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth <BR>
Dominion exercise and in the Aire, <BR>
Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd, <BR>
Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. <BR>
My Substitutes I send ye, and Create <BR>
Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might <BR>
Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now <BR>
My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, <BR>
Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit. <BR>
If your joynt power prevaile, th' affaires of Hell <BR>
No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. <BR>
<BR>
  So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed <BR>
Thir course through thickest Constellations held <BR>
Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, <BR>
And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips <BR>
Then sufferd.  Th' other way SATAN went down <BR>
The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side <BR>
Disparted CHAOS over built exclaimd, <BR>
And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, <BR>
That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate, <BR>
Wide open and unguarded, SATAN pass'd, <BR>
And all about found desolate; for those <BR>
Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, <BR>
Flown to the upper World; the rest were all <BR>
Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls <BR>
Of PANDEMONIUM, Citie and proud seate <BR>
Of LUCIFER, so by allusion calld, <BR>
Of that bright Starr to SATAN paragond. <BR>
There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand <BR>
In Council sate, sollicitous what chance <BR>
Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee <BR>
Departing gave command, and they observ'd. <BR>
As when the TARTAR from his RUSSIAN Foe <BR>
By ASTRACAN over the Snowie Plaines <BR>
Retires, or BACTRIAN Sophi from the hornes <BR>
Of TURKISH Crescent, leaves all waste beyond <BR>
The Realme of ALADULE, in his retreate <BR>
To TAURIS or CASBEEN.  So these the late <BR>
Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell <BR>
Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch <BR>
Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting <BR>
Each hour their great adventurer from the search <BR>
Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, <BR>
In shew plebeian Angel militant <BR>
Of lowest order, past; and from the dore <BR>
Of that PLUTONIAN Hall, invisible <BR>
Ascended his high Throne, which under state <BR>
Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end <BR>
Was plac't in regal lustre.  Down a while <BR>
He sate, and round about him saw unseen: <BR>
At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head <BR>
And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad <BR>
With what permissive glory since his fall <BR>
Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd <BR>
At that so sudden blaze the STYGIAN throng <BR>
Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, <BR>
Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: <BR>
Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers, <BR>
Rais'd from thir dark DIVAN, and with like joy <BR>
Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand <BR>
Silence, and with these words attention won. <BR>
<BR>
  Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, <BR>
For in possession such, not onely of right, <BR>
I call ye and declare ye now, returnd <BR>
Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth <BR>
Triumphant out of this infernal Pit <BR>
Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, <BR>
And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, <BR>
As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven <BR>
Little inferiour, by my adventure hard <BR>
With peril great atchiev'd.  Long were to tell <BR>
What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine <BR>
Voyag'd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep <BR>
Of horrible confusion, over which <BR>
By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd <BR>
To expedite your glorious march; but I <BR>
Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride <BR>
Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb <BR>
Of unoriginal NIGHT and CHAOS wilde, <BR>
That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd <BR>
My journey strange, with clamorous uproare <BR>
Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found <BR>
The new created World, which fame in Heav'n <BR>
Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful <BR>
Of absolute perfection, therein Man <BR>
Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile <BR>
Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd <BR>
From his Creator, and the more to increase <BR>
Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat <BR>
Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up <BR>
Both his beloved Man and all his World, <BR>
To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, <BR>
Without our hazard, labour or allarme, <BR>
To range in, and to dwell, and over Man <BR>
To rule, as over all he should have rul'd. <BR>
True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather <BR>
Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape <BR>
Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, <BR>
Is enmity, which he will put between <BR>
Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; <BR>
His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: <BR>
A World who would not purchase with a bruise, <BR>
Or much more grievous pain?  Ye have th' account <BR>
Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods, <BR>
But up and enter now into full bliss. <BR>
<BR>
  So having said, a while he stood, expecting <BR>
Thir universal shout and high applause <BR>
To fill his eare, when contrary he hears <BR>
On all sides, from innumerable tongues <BR>
A dismal universal hiss, the sound <BR>
Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long <BR>
Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; <BR>
His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, <BR>
His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining <BR>
Each other, till supplanted down he fell <BR>
A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, <BR>
Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power <BR>
Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, <BR>
According to his doom: he would have spoke, <BR>
But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue <BR>
To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd <BR>
Alike, to Serpents all as accessories <BR>
To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din <BR>
Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now <BR>
With complicated monsters, head and taile, <BR>
Scorpion and Asp, and AMPHISBAENA dire, <BR>
CERASTES hornd, HYDRUS, and ELLOPS drear, <BR>
And DIPSAS (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil <BR>
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle <BR>
OPHIUSA) but still greatest hee the midst, <BR>
Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun <BR>
Ingenderd in the PYTHIAN Vale on slime, <BR>
Huge PYTHON, and his Power no less he seem'd <BR>
Above the rest still to retain; they all <BR>
Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field, <BR>
Where all yet left of that revolted Rout <BR>
Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, <BR>
Sublime with expectation when to see <BR>
In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; <BR>
They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd <BR>
Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, <BR>
And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, <BR>
They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, <BR>
Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, <BR>
And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form <BR>
Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, <BR>
As in thir crime.  Thus was th' applause they meant, <BR>
Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame <BR>
Cast on themselves from thir own mouths.  There stood <BR>
A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, <BR>
His will who reigns above, to aggravate <BR>
Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that <BR>
VVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of EVE <BR>
Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange <BR>
Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining <BR>
For one forbidden Tree a multitude <BR>
Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; <BR>
Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, <BR>
Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, <BR>
But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees <BR>
Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks <BR>
That curld MEGAERA: greedily they pluck'd <BR>
The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew <BR>
Neer that bituminous Lake where SODOM flam'd; <BR>
This more delusive, not the touch, but taste <BR>
Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay <BR>
Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit <BR>
Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste <BR>
VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, <BR>
Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, <BR>
VVith hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws <BR>
VVith foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell <BR>
Into the same illusion, not as Man <BR>
Whom they triumph'd once lapst.  Thus were they plagu'd <BR>
And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, <BR>
Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, <BR>
Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo <BR>
This annual humbling certain number'd days, <BR>
To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. <BR>
However some tradition they dispers'd <BR>
Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, <BR>
And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld <BR>
OPHION with EURYNOME, the wide- <BR>
Encroaching EVE perhaps, had first the rule <BR>
Of high OLYMPUS, thence by SATURN driv'n <BR>
And OPS, ere yet DICTAEAN JOVE was born. <BR>
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair <BR>
Too soon arriv'd, SIN there in power before, <BR>
Once actual, now in body, and to dwell <BR>
Habitual habitant; behind her DEATH <BR>
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet <BR>
On his pale Horse: to whom SIN thus began. <BR>
<BR>
  Second of SATAN sprung, all conquering Death, <BR>
What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd <BR>
With travail difficult, not better farr <BR>
Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, <BR>
Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? <BR>
<BR>
  Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. <BR>
To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, <BR>
Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, <BR>
There best, where most with ravin I may meet; <BR>
Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems <BR>
To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd. <BR>
Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, &amp; Flours <BR>
Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, <BR>
No homely morsels, and whatever thing <BR>
The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd, <BR>
Till I in Man residing through the Race, <BR>
His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, <BR>
And season him thy last and sweetest prey. <BR>
<BR>
  This said, they both betook them several wayes, <BR>
Both to destroy, or unimmortal make <BR>
All kinds, and for destruction to mature <BR>
Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing, <BR>
From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, <BR>
To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. <BR>
<BR>
  See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance <BR>
To waste and havoc yonder VVorld, which I <BR>
So fair and good created, and had still <BR>
Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man <BR>
Let in these wastful Furies, who impute <BR>
Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell <BR>
And his Adherents, that with so much ease <BR>
I suffer them to enter and possess <BR>
A place so heav'nly, and conniving seem <BR>
To gratifie my scornful Enemies, <BR>
That laugh, as if transported with some fit <BR>
Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, <BR>
At random yeilded up to their misrule; <BR>
And know not that I call'd and drew them thither <BR>
My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth <BR>
Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed <BR>
On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst <BR>
With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling <BR>
Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, <BR>
Both SIN, and DEATH, and yawning GRAVE at last <BR>
Through CHAOS hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell <BR>
For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. <BR>
Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure <BR>
To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: <BR>
Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes. <BR>
<BR>
  Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud <BR>
Sung HALLELUIA, as the sound of Seas, <BR>
Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, <BR>
Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; <BR>
Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son, <BR>
Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom <BR>
New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, <BR>
Or down from Heav'n descend.  Such was thir song, <BR>
While the Creator calling forth by name <BR>
His mightie Angels gave them several charge, <BR>
As sorted best with present things.  The Sun <BR>
Had first his precept so to move, so shine, <BR>
As might affect the Earth with cold and heat <BR>
Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call <BR>
Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring <BR>
Solstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moone <BR>
Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five <BR>
Thir planetarie motions and aspects <BR>
In SEXTILE, SQUARE, and TRINE, and OPPOSITE, <BR>
Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne <BR>
In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt <BR>
Thir influence malignant when to showre, <BR>
Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, <BR>
Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set <BR>
Thir corners, when with bluster to confound <BR>
Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle <BR>
With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. <BR>
Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse <BR>
The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more <BR>
From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd <BR>
Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun <BR>
Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode <BR>
Like distant breadth to TAURUS with the Seav'n <BR>
ATLANTICK Sisters, and the SPARTAN Twins <BR>
Up to the TROPIC Crab; thence down amaine <BR>
By LEO and the VIRGIN and the SCALES, <BR>
As deep as CAPRICORNE, to bring in change <BR>
Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring <BR>
Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours, <BR>
Equal in Days and Nights, except to those <BR>
Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day <BR>
Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun <BR>
To recompence his distance, in thir sight <BR>
Had rounded still th' HORIZON, and not known <BR>
Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow <BR>
From cold ESTOTILAND, and South as farr <BR>
Beneath MAGELLAN.  At that tasted Fruit <BR>
The Sun, as from THYESTEAN Banquet, turn'd <BR>
His course intended; else how had the World <BR>
Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, <BR>
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? <BR>
These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd <BR>
Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, <BR>
Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, <BR>
Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North <BR>
Of NORUMBEGA, and the SAMOED shoar <BR>
Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice <BR>
And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, <BR>
BOREAS and CAECIAS and ARGESTES loud <BR>
And THRASCIAS rend the Woods and Seas upturn; <BR>
With adverse blast up-turns them from the South <BR>
NOTUS and AFER black with thundrous Clouds <BR>
From SERRALIONA; thwart of these as fierce <BR>
Forth rush the LEVANT and the PONENT VVindes <BR>
EURUS and ZEPHIR with thir lateral noise, <BR>
SIROCCO, and LIBECCHIO.  Thus began <BR>
Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first <BR>
Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational, <BR>
Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: <BR>
Beast now with Beast gan war, &amp; Fowle with Fowle, <BR>
And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, <BR>
Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe <BR>
Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim <BR>
Glar'd on him passing: these were from without <BR>
The growing miseries, which ADAM saw <BR>
Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, <BR>
To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, <BR>
And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost, <BR>
Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. <BR>
<BR>
  O miserable of happie! is this the end <BR>
Of this new glorious World, and mee so late <BR>
The Glory of that Glory, who now becom <BR>
Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face <BR>
Of God, whom to behold was then my highth <BR>
Of happiness: yet well, if here would end <BR>
The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare <BR>
My own deservings; but this will not serve; <BR>
All that I eate or drink, or shall beget, <BR>
Is propagated curse.  O voice once heard <BR>
Delightfully, ENCREASE AND MULTIPLY, <BR>
Now death to heare! for what can I encrease <BR>
Or multiplie, but curses on my head? <BR>
Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling <BR>
The evil on him brought by me, will curse <BR>
My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, <BR>
For this we may thank ADAM; but his thanks <BR>
Shall be the execration; so besides <BR>
Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee <BR>
Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, <BR>
On mee as on thir natural center light <BR>
Heavie, though in thir place.  O fleeting joyes <BR>
Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! <BR>
Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay <BR>
To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee <BR>
From darkness to promote me, or here place <BR>
In this delicious Garden? as my Will <BR>
Concurd not to my being, it were but right <BR>
And equal to reduce me to my dust, <BR>
Desirous to resigne, and render back <BR>
All I receav'd, unable to performe <BR>
Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold <BR>
The good I sought not.  To the loss of that, <BR>
Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added <BR>
The sense of endless woes? inexplicable <BR>
Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, <BR>
I thus contest; then should have been refusd <BR>
Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: <BR>
Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, <BR>
Then cavil the conditions? and though God <BR>
Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son <BR>
Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, <BR>
Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: <BR>
Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee <BR>
That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, <BR>
But Natural necessity begot. <BR>
God made thee of choice his own, and of his own <BR>
To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, <BR>
Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. <BR>
Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, <BR>
That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: <BR>
O welcom hour whenever! why delayes <BR>
His hand to execute what his Decree <BR>
Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, <BR>
Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out <BR>
To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet <BR>
Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth <BR>
Insensible, how glad would lay me down <BR>
As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest <BR>
And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more <BR>
Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse <BR>
To mee and to my ofspring would torment me <BR>
With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt <BR>
Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, <BR>
Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man <BR>
Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish <BR>
With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, <BR>
Or in some other dismal place, who knows <BR>
But I shall die a living Death?  O thought <BR>
Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath <BR>
Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life <BR>
And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. <BR>
All of me then shall die: let this appease <BR>
The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. <BR>
For though the Lord of all be infinite, <BR>
Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, <BR>
But mortal doom'd.  How can he exercise <BR>
Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? <BR>
Can he make deathless Death? that were to make <BR>
Strange contradiction, which to God himself <BR>
Impossible is held, as Argument <BR>
Of weakness, not of Power.  Will he, draw out, <BR>
For angers sake, finite to infinite <BR>
In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour <BR>
Satisfi'd never; that were to extend <BR>
His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, <BR>
By which all Causes else according still <BR>
To the reception of thir matter act, <BR>
Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare.  But say <BR>
That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd, <BR>
Bereaving sense, but endless miserie <BR>
From this day onward, which I feel begun <BR>
Both in me, and without me, and so last <BR>
To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear <BR>
Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution <BR>
On my defensless head; both Death and I <BR>
Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, <BR>
Nor I on my part single, in mee all <BR>
Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie <BR>
That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able <BR>
To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! <BR>
So disinherited how would ye bless <BR>
Me now your Curse!  Ah, why should all mankind <BR>
For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, <BR>
If guiltless?  But from mee what can proceed, <BR>
But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd, <BR>
Not to do onely, but to will the same <BR>
With me? how can they acquitted stand <BR>
In sight of God?  Him after all Disputes <BR>
Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain <BR>
And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still <BR>
But to my own conviction: first and last <BR>
On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring <BR>
Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; <BR>
So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support <BR>
That burden heavier then the Earth to bear, <BR>
Then all the world much heavier, though divided <BR>
With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desir'st, <BR>
And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope <BR>
Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable <BR>
Beyond all past example and future, <BR>
To SATAN onely like both crime and doom. <BR>
O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears <BR>
And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which <BR>
I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! <BR>
<BR>
  Thus ADAM to himself lamented loud <BR>
Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell, <BR>
Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air <BR>
Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, <BR>
Which to his evil Conscience represented <BR>
All things with double terror: On the ground <BR>
Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft <BR>
Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd <BR>
Of tardie execution, since denounc't <BR>
The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death, <BR>
Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke <BR>
To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word, <BR>
Justice Divine not hast'n to be just? <BR>
But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine <BR>
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. <BR>
O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, <BR>
VVith other echo farr I taught your Shades <BR>
To answer, and resound farr other Song. <BR>
VVhom thus afflicted when sad EVE beheld, <BR>
Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, <BR>
Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: <BR>
But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best <BR>
Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false <BR>
And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, <BR>
Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew <BR>
Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee <BR>
Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended <BR>
To hellish falshood, snare them.  But for thee <BR>
I had persisted happie, had not thy pride <BR>
And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, <BR>
Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd <BR>
Not to be trusted, longing to be seen <BR>
Though by the Devil himself, him overweening <BR>
To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting <BR>
Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee, <BR>
To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, <BR>
Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, <BR>
And understood not all was but a shew <BR>
Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib <BR>
Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, <BR>
More to the part sinister from me drawn, <BR>
Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie <BR>
To my just number found.  O why did God, <BR>
Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n <BR>
With Spirits Masculine, create at last <BR>
This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect <BR>
Of Nature, and not fill the World at once <BR>
With Men as Angels without Feminine, <BR>
Or find some other way to generate <BR>
Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, <BR>
And more that shall befall, innumerable <BR>
Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, <BR>
And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either <BR>
He never shall find out fit Mate, but such <BR>
As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, <BR>
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain <BR>
Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind <BR>
By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld <BR>
By Parents, or his happiest choice too late <BR>
Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound <BR>
To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: <BR>
Which infinite calamitie shall cause <BR>
To humane life, and houshold peace confound. <BR>
<BR>
  He added not, and from her turn'd, but EVE <BR>
Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing, <BR>
And tresses all disorderd, at his feet <BR>
Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught <BR>
His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. <BR>
<BR>
  Forsake me not thus, ADAM, witness Heav'n <BR>
What love sincere, and reverence in my heart <BR>
I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, <BR>
Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant <BR>
I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, <BR>
Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, <BR>
Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, <BR>
My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, <BR>
Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? <BR>
While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, <BR>
Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, <BR>
As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie <BR>
Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us, <BR>
That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not <BR>
Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, <BR>
On me already lost, mee then thy self <BR>
More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou <BR>
Against God onely, I against God and thee, <BR>
And to the place of judgement will return, <BR>
There with my cries importune Heaven, that all <BR>
The sentence from thy head remov'd may light <BR>
On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, <BR>
Mee mee onely just object of his ire. <BR>
<BR>
  She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, <BR>
Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault <BR>
Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in ADAM wraught <BR>
Commiseration; soon his heart relented <BR>
Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, <BR>
Now at his feet submissive in distress, <BR>
Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, <BR>
His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; <BR>
As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, <BR>
And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. <BR>
<BR>
  Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, <BR>
So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st <BR>
The punishment all on thy self; alas, <BR>
Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine <BR>
His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, <BR>
And my displeasure bearst so ill.  If Prayers <BR>
Could alter high Decrees, I to that place <BR>
Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, <BR>
That on my head all might be visited, <BR>
Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n, <BR>
To me committed and by me expos'd. <BR>
But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame <BR>
Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive <BR>
In offices of Love, how we may light'n <BR>
Each others burden in our share of woe; <BR>
Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see, <BR>
Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, <BR>
A long days dying to augment our paine, <BR>
And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus EVE, recovering heart, repli'd. <BR>
ADAM, by sad experiment I know <BR>
How little weight my words with thee can finde, <BR>
Found so erroneous, thence by just event <BR>
Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, <BR>
Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place <BR>
Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine <BR>
Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart, <BR>
Living or dying from thee I will not hide <BR>
What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, <BR>
Tending to som relief of our extremes, <BR>
Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, <BR>
As in our evils, and of easier choice. <BR>
If care of our descent perplex us most, <BR>
Which must be born to certain woe, devourd <BR>
By Death at last, and miserable it is <BR>
To be to others cause of misery, <BR>
Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring <BR>
Into this cursed World a woful Race, <BR>
That after wretched Life must be at last <BR>
Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power <BR>
It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent <BR>
The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. <BR>
Childless thou art, Childless remaine: <BR>
So Death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two <BR>
Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw. <BR>
But if thou judge it hard and difficult, <BR>
Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain <BR>
From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet, <BR>
And with desire to languish without hope, <BR>
Before the present object languishing <BR>
With like desire, which would be miserie <BR>
And torment less then none of what we dread, <BR>
Then both our selves and Seed at once to free <BR>
From what we fear for both, let us make short, <BR>
Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply <BR>
With our own hands his Office on our selves; <BR>
Why stand we longer shivering under feares, <BR>
That shew no end but Death, and have the power, <BR>
Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing, <BR>
Destruction with destruction to destroy. <BR>
<BR>
  She ended heer, or vehement despaire <BR>
Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts <BR>
Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale. <BR>
But ADAM with such counsel nothing sway'd, <BR>
To better hopes his more attentive minde <BR>
Labouring had rais'd, and thus to EVE repli'd. <BR>
<BR>
  EVE, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems <BR>
To argue in thee somthing more sublime <BR>
And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; <BR>
But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes <BR>
That excellence thought in thee, and implies, <BR>
Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret <BR>
For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd. <BR>
Or if thou covet death, as utmost end <BR>
Of miserie, so thinking to evade <BR>
The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God <BR>
Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so <BR>
To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death <BR>
So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine <BR>
We are by doom to pay; rather such acts <BR>
Of contumacie will provoke the highest <BR>
To make death in us live: Then let us seek <BR>
Som safer resolution, which methinks <BR>
I have in view, calling to minde with heed <BR>
Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise <BR>
The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless <BR>
Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe <BR>
SATAN, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd <BR>
Against us this deceit: to crush his head <BR>
Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost <BR>
By death brought on our selves, or childless days <BR>
Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe <BR>
Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee <BR>
Instead shall double ours upon our heads. <BR>
No more be mention'd then of violence <BR>
Against our selves, and wilful barrenness, <BR>
That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely <BR>
Rancor and pride, impatience and despite, <BR>
Reluctance against God and his just yoke <BR>
Laid on our Necks.  Remember with what mild <BR>
And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd <BR>
Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected <BR>
Immediate dissolution, which we thought <BR>
Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee <BR>
Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold, <BR>
And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy, <BR>
Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope <BR>
Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne <BR>
My bread; what harm?  Idleness had bin worse; <BR>
My labour will sustain me; and least Cold <BR>
Or Heat should injure us, his timely care <BR>
Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands <BR>
Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd; <BR>
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear <BR>
Be open, and his heart to pitie incline, <BR>
And teach us further by what means to shun <BR>
Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow, <BR>
Which now the Skie with various Face begins <BR>
To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds <BR>
Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks <BR>
Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek <BR>
Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish <BR>
Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr <BR>
Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams <BR>
Reflected, may with matter sere foment, <BR>
Or by collision of two bodies grinde <BR>
The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds <BR>
Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock <BR>
Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down <BR>
Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine, <BR>
And sends a comfortable heat from farr, <BR>
Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use, <BR>
And what may else be remedie or cure <BR>
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, <BR>
Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace <BR>
Beseeching him, so as we need not fear <BR>
To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd <BR>
By him with many comforts, till we end <BR>
In dust, our final rest and native home. <BR>
What better can we do, then to the place <BR>
Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall <BR>
Before him reverent, and there confess <BR>
Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears <BR>
VVatering the ground, and with our sighs the Air <BR>
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign <BR>
Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. <BR>
Undoubtedly he will relent and turn <BR>
From his displeasure; in whose look serene, <BR>
VVhen angry most he seem'd and most severe, <BR>
VVhat else but favor, grace, and mercie shon? <BR>
<BR>
  So spake our Father penitent, nor EVE <BR>
Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place <BR>
Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell <BR>
Before him reverent, and both confess'd <BR>
Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears <BR>
VVatering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air <BR>
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign <BR>
Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. <BR>
