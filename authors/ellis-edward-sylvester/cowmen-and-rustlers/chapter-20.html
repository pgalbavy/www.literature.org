<p>It was a dignified proceeding on the part of Monteith Sterry,
and the rustler possessed enough gentlemanly instinct to appreciate
the feelings of the young man, who had attested his courage too
often for any one to question it. But at the moment of wheeling
his mare to ride off both caught the sound of approaching horsemen,
and Sterry checked his animal.</p>

<p>"Who are they?" he asked, glancing at the rustler.</p>

<p>"How should I know? They may be some of your folks."</p>

<p>"They are as likely to be yours. I don't think, Duke, it is wise
for us to stay here where we offer such inviting targets, for
whoever the party may be, one of us is sure to be an enemy."</p>

<p>Monteith Sterry moved away from the area of illumination as he
spoke, Vesey keeping close to his side.</p>

<p>"Is it understood, Duke," asked the younger, "there's a truce
between you and me?"</p>

<p>"Of course; if you know anything about Duke Vesey, you know he's
square. If they happen to be some of our boys, I won't take any
advantage of you, nor let them, if I can help it."</p>

<p>"And if they are Capt. Asbury and others, I will reciprocate."</p>

<p>Enough was said. Enemies though the men were, no bosom friends
could have been more in unison for the time. Ready to shoot each
other on sight less than an hour before, and as they were liable
to be within the following hour, they were equally ready to risk
their lives, if necessary, to carry out the pledge just exchanged.</p>

<p>They had to ride but a short way when the gloom became deep enough
to protect them against the sight of the horsemen who were approaching
from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Six men rode into view, halting on the spot vacated by the couple
just before, the one at the head being recognized in the glow
of the burning ruins as Capt. Asbury, with whom the affray had
taken place a short time previous. Sterry knew each, as did his
companion.</p>

<p>"All the party do not seem to be there," remarked Sterry.</p>

<p>"They are not," replied Vesey; "three are missing."</p>

<p>"I wonder if anything can have happened to them?"</p>

<p>"Accidents are liable to take place in this part of the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hands up!" was the startling command that broke upon the couple
at that moment, from a point directly behind them.</p>

<p>The truth was, Sterry and Vesey had been seen by the horsemen
as they stole away in the gloom. Capt. Asbury, suspecting they
were rustlers, sent three of his men out beyond them on foot,
and they did their part so well that they came up without alarming
either of their horses, who ordinarily would have detected them.</p>

<p>"I've been trapped!" muttered Vesey, savagely, glancing at the
figures, standing but a short way off in the moonlight, with their
Winchesters levelled.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Sterry, quickly, "up with your hands, as I
do, or we'll both catch it; I'll stand by you."</p>

<p>The rustler was wise enough to obey, with only a momentary hesitation.
Had he not done so, he would never have had a second chance, for
the stockmen were very much in earnest.</p>

<p>The footmen came forward with their weapons at a level, for they
were too prudent to give their prisoners a chance.</p>

<p>"How are you, Hendricks?" asked Sterry, with a laugh, as the
trio joined them.</p>

<p>The man addressed peered closely in his face, suspecting, and
yet not convinced of his identity until after a minute or two.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged!" he exclaimed; "is that you, Mont?"</p>

<p>"I have a suspicion that it is," was the reply of Sterry, laughing
quite heartily as he lowered his hands.</p>

<p>"Who is your friend?" he asked, moving around to gain a better
view of the rustler.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's the man we're looking for," added Hendricks a moment
later; "he's Duke Vesey, the partner of the late Jack Perkins."</p>

<p>"You are right," Sterry hastened to say, "but he is under the
protection of a flag of truce."</p>

<p>"A flag of truce!" repeated the other; "where is it?"</p>

<p>"I gave him my pledge to shield him against you folks, as he
agreed to do if your party had proven to be his friends."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a queer state of affairs," laughed the other, not
forgetting to keep guard of the prisoner, who was permitted to
lower his hands. The other stockmen were equally alert, now that
there was but one man to watch, so that Vesey was really as helpless
as though deprived of all his weapons.</p>

<p>"I do not see what is so queer about it," replied Sterry, warmly;
"we heard you coming and moved off out of sight. Before doing
so Vesey pledged himself to stand by me against any of his friends,
if it became necessary, and I promised to do the same for him.
The issue shows that it is my privilege to keep my promise&mdash;that's
all."</p>

<p>It was plain that Hendricks felt himself in a quandary. He had
been sent out to capture the two men under the supposition that
they were rustlers. It was proved that one of them was the very
individual whom Capt. Asbury was anxious to secure. To release
him after taking him prisoner would place his captor in anything
but a pleasant situation with his leader.</p>

<p>Suspecting his dilemma, Sterry said:</p>

<p>"You can readily arrange it by taking me in as prisoner and allowing
Vesey to go."</p>

<p>"That is all well enough, but it will put me in a hole that I
don't intend to be put in. Capt. Asbury is the boss of this business;
you two can ride up to him and make your report; that will place
the responsibility where it belongs."</p>

<p>This seemed reasonable, but Sterry felt uneasy. He knew the violent
temper of Capt. Asbury, and feared he would refuse to acknowledge
the agreement as binding upon him. On the other hand, Sterry was
determined to stand by his pledge to the last.</p>

<p>"I can't consent to that," he said.</p>

<p>"You've got to," replied Hendricks; "it is idle to suppose that
any such bargain as you may choose to make can be binding on others
who were not present when it was made, and therefore were not
parties to it."</p>

<p>"That is one way of putting it, but the promise is binding on
me, and as true as I am a living man I will fight to the death
against you and the whole party before this person shall suffer
because of his faith in my word."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, fight it is; he has got to surrender to Capt.
Asbury and await what he is willing to do with him."</p>

<p>"Duke," said Sterry, turning to the rustler, "it's two of us
against three, and you and I have been there before."</p>

<p>But on the verge of the explosion the rustler came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"There's no need of any row, Sterry; I'll surrender and take
my chances."</p>

<p>And to settle the dispute he struck his horse into a gallop,
and before the surprise was over rode up to the group, who were
gazing wonderingly off in the gloom, whence came the sound of
voices.</p>

<p>Sterry and the footmen were but a brief space behind them. While
the astonished captain and his companions were looking around
for an explanation, Mont Sterry made it in as brief and pointed
words as were at his command.</p>

<p>Capt. Asbury fixed his gray eyes upon the handsome countenance
of the young man during the few minutes he was speaking, and Sterry
saw, despite the forceful terms in which he stated the agreement,
that the leading stockman was angry.</p>

<p>"I've no objection," he remarked, striving to control his voice,
which was tremulous with anger, "if you choose to play the woman,
but I don't see what I've got to do with it."</p>

<p>"Vesey surrendered under my promise that he should be protected;
had he not believed that promise he would not have surrendered."</p>

<p>"But would have been shot down where he sat in the saddle. Had
he been beyond reach and come in under such a pledge, the case
would have been altogether different; but as it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>The fateful words were interrupted by a rush and dash. Attention
had been diverted for the moment from the prisoner to the one
who was pleading for him and to him who held his fate in his hands.
The observant Vesey saw the inevitable trend of events, and, taking
advantage of the chance, was off like a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>The parting glimpse showed him leaning forward on his horse,
who was plunging at utmost speed straight away in the gloom. A
half dozen shots were sent after him and something like pursuit
was attempted, but brief as was the start gained it was sufficient,
and he was soon beyond all danger.</p>
