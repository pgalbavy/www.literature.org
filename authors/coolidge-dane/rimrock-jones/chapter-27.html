<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>For the few brief weeks before the great trial the office was swarming
with men.  There were high-priced lawyers and geologists of renown and
experts on every phase of the suit, and in the midst of them sat
Rimrock Jones.  He wore his big black hat that had cost him a hundred
dollars--including the hat-check tips at the Waldorf--and his pistol
was always at his hip.  Every step of their case was carefully framed
up in the long councils that took place, but at the end Rimrock lost
his nerve.  For the first time in his life, and with all eyes upon him,
he weakened and lowered his proud head.  He had a hunch he would lose.
</p><p>For all those weeks he had been haunted by a presence that always
flitted out of his way; but now she was there, in the crowded
court-room, and she greeted him with a slow, mirthless smile.  It was
Mary Fortune and he remembered all too well that time when she had told
him he would lose.  She had said he would lose because he had no case,
and because he used money instead; but he knew from that smile she had
other reasons for pronouncing his doom in advance.  He had lawyers
hired who told him, to the contrary, that he had a very good case--and
Stoddard had spent money, too.  Not openly, of course, but through his
attorneys; but that was customary, it was always done.  No, behind all
her professions of respect for the judiciary and of worship for the
law, she must know that the right sometimes failed.  But behind that
smile there was the absolute certainty that in some way he was certain
to lose.
</p><p>He met her glance as he came into the court-room surrounded by a troop
of his friends, surrounded by lawyers and mining experts and geologists
who professed to see through the earth, and before her gaze he halted
and blenched.  There was another person there who regarded him coldly
with a glance like a rapier thrust; but it was not of Stoddard he was
afraid.  It was of Mary Fortune, who had come out against him and who
could hear through walls with her 'phone.  What she knew might have
helped him, but she was against him now--and she had told him in
advance that he would lose.
</p><p>As Rimrock sat thinking, his eyes cast down and his mind far back in
the past, a great blow was struck by the bailiff's mallet and the crowd
rose up to its feet.  A stern-faced judge, robed in the black cloak of
his office, stepped out through the curtains behind the bench and as
Rimrock stared the bailiff beckoned him sharply and he scrambled to his
feet with the rest.
</p><p>"Oyez!  Oyez!  Oyez!" cried the bailiff in the words that echoed of the
past.  "The United States District Court is now in session!"
</p><p>He struck again as the judge took his seat and Rimrock sank down into
his chair.  But he had stood in respect to the majesty of the law and
it was then that his hunch came back.  For this was no appeal to an
elected judge or the easily swayed emotions of a jury; it was an appeal
to the cold, passionless mind of a man who considered nothing but the
law.
</p><p>Ike Bray was there, looking pinched and scared, and the two guards who
had witnessed his relocation, and they testified to the facts.  In vain
Rimrock's lawyers orated and thundered or artfully framed up their long
questions; it took days to do it, but when the testimony was all in it
was apparent that Ike Bray's claim would hold.  But this was only the
beginning of the battle, the skirmish to feel out the ground; and now
the defense brought up its big guns.  One after the other they put
experts on the stand to testify to the geology of the Tecolote; but
Cummins and Ford produced others as eminent who testified to the
opposite effect.  So the battle raged until the wearied judge limited
the profitless discussion to one more day, and then Cummins and Ford
launched their bombshell.
</p><p>"Your Honor," began Cummins as he rose with a great document.  "I
should like to introduce as evidence this report, which unfortunately
has only just come to hand.  As Your Honor has intimated the testimony
of hired experts is always open to suspicion of bias, and especially
where great interests are at stake; but I am able to offer for the
information of the Court a document both impartial and thorough.  It is
the combined reports of three practical geologists employed by the
Tecolote Company itself, though at a time preceding this suit and
intended solely for the purposes of exploration.  As Your Honor will
observe, although the reports were made independently and under orders
to seek nothing but the facts, they agree substantially in this: that,
within an extension of its end-lines, the Old Juan claim is the true
apex of the entire Tecolote ore body."
</p><p>He handed over the report and sat down in triumph, while Rimrock's
lawyers all objected at once.  The argument upon admitting to evidence
this secret but authoritative report, consumed the greater part of the
day; and at the end the plaintiff rested his case.  Throughout the din
of words, the verbal clashes, the long and wearisome citing of
authorities and the brief "Overruled!" of the judge, Rimrock Jones sat
sullen and downcast; and at the end he got up and went out.  No one
followed to cheer or console him--it was his confession of utter
defeat.  And the following day, when the Court convened, a verdict was
rendered for the plaintiff.  The lawyers and experts took their checks
and departed and Rimrock Jones went home.
</p><p>He went back to Gunsight where he had seen his greatest triumphs and
his days of blackest defeat and waited for Stoddard to strike.  It was
all over now--all over but the details and the final acceptance of
terms--and, while he waited, he packed up to go.  No one knew better
than Rimrock himself that it was right and fitting to move on.  Old
hatreds and animosities, old heart-burnings and recriminations, would
make Gunsight a hell-spot for him, and thwart him at every move.  It
was best to go on to Mexico.  Even Hassayamp and L. W. agreed in this,
although L. W. insisted upon staking him and declared it was all his
own fault.  But Mary Fortune, whether she gloried in his fall or pitied
him for his great loss, kept discreetly out of his way.
</p><p>She faced him the first time at the special meeting when Stoddard came
to lay down his terms.  As a legal fiction, a technical subterfuge, he
still claimed to have bought up Bray's claim; but no one was deceived
as to his intent.  If he had bought Bray out it was not for the
Company, but for Whitney H. Stoddard personally; and with no intention
of compromising.  He came in briskly, his face stern and forbidding,
his eyes burning with ill-suppressed fire; and he sat down impatiently
to wait.  Then as Rimrock slouched in and called the meeting to order
Stoddard picked up a piece of blank paper and began to tear it into
long, slender shreds.
</p><p>"Well, to get down to business," said Rimrock at last after the various
reports had been read, "we have come here, I take it, for a purpose."
</p><p>He raised his eyes and met Stoddard's defiantly, but Mary looked away.
</p><p>"Yes, we have," answered Stoddard with business-like directness, "I
have a proposition to make.  As I suppose you both know I have bought
up the claim of Mr. Bray, as decided by the court.  That claim, of
course, practically invalidates your stock since it takes away
possession of the mine; but I am willing to make you a generous offer.
Our undivided profits--minus the amount, of course, that our General
Manager has squandered on his defense--will be shared among us, pro
rata.  This will be in cash, and in consideration of the payment, I
shall expect you to turn in your stock."
</p><p>"What?  For nothing?" cried Mary; but Rimrock did not flinch though his
face became set with rage.
</p><p>"It can hardly be called nothing," replied Stoddard severely, "when
your own share comes to over two hundred thousand dollars.  And as for
Mr. Jones, he understands very well that I can claim every dollar he
has."
</p><p>"Well, that may be so, since you have a claim against him, but my stock
is unencumbered.  And since my share of the profits is in no sense a
payment I shall decline to turn in my stock."
</p><p>"Very well," answered Stoddard, his voice low and colorless, "I shall
turn the matter over to my attorney and refuse to vote the dividend."
</p><p>"Ah, I see," she murmured and glanced at Rimrock who answered with a
curl of the lip.
</p><p>"Mr. President," she said, "I move that the money at present in our
treasury be set aside as a profit and divided among the stockholders
pro rata."
</p><p>"Just a moment!" warned Stoddard as Rimrock seemed about to fall in
with her, "you can never collect that money.  I have notified Mr.
Lockhart, the treasurer of our Company, that I will hold him personally
responsible for every dollar he pays out, without my official O.K.  You
understand what that means.  Within less than a month, through my suit
now in court, I can claim every share of Mr. Jones' stock.  Its value,
in law, has been reduced to nothing, outside of this undivided profit;
and that I offer you now.  If you refuse I shall get judgment, claim
his entire share of the profits, and take possession of the whole
Tecolote properties by right of the Old Juan decision.  I advise you to
accept my first offer."
</p><p>"All right," spoke up Rimrock, "I knew you'd rob me.  Write out the
check and I'll be on my way."
</p><p>"No, indeed!" cried Mary, "don't you let him fleece you!  I've got
something to say here, myself!"
</p><p>"Well, say it to him, then," returned Rimrock, wearily, "I'm sick and
disgusted with the whole business."
</p><p>"Yes, naturally," observed Stoddard, reaching into his pocket and
deliberately pulling out his checkbook.  "Most people are, by the time
I get through with them; and your case is no exception.  You made the
mistake of trying to oppose me."
</p><p>"I made the mistake," returned Rimrock hoarsely, "of trusting a lot of
crooks.  But I never trusted you--don't you think it for a
minute--you've got n. g. written all over you."
</p><p>"Another remark like that," said Stoddard freezingly, "and I'll put my
checkbook away."
</p><p>"You do it," warned Rimrock without changing his position, "and I'll
blow the top of your head off."
</p><p>Stoddard looked at him keenly, then uncapped his pen and proceeded to
fill out the stub.  For a moment there was silence, broken by the soft
scratching of the pen, and then Mary Fortune stood up.
</p><p>"I know it is customary," she said in suppressed tones, "for men to
settle everything themselves; but you, Mr. Stoddard, and you, Mr.
Jones, are going to listen to me.  I have put up long enough with your
high-handed methods; but now, will you kindly look at that?"
</p><p>She laid a paper on the table before Stoddard and stood back to watch
the effect, but Rimrock only grunted contemptuously.
</p><p>"Aw, fill out my check!" he said impatiently, but Stoddard was staring
at the paper.
</p><p>"Why, what is this?  Where did you get this, Miss Fortune?  I don't
think I quite understand."
</p><p>"No, naturally!  You overlooked the fact that a woman can jump claims,
too.  That is a recorded copy of my re-location of the Old Juan claim,
at twelve-fifty-one, on January first.  Your drunken Ike Bray came
along at one-thirty and tacked his notice over mine.  And now I must
thank you, gentlemen, both of you, for your kind efforts in my behalf.
By spending your money on this expensive lawsuit you have proved my
title to the Tecolote Mine."
</p><p>She sat down, smiling, and as Stoddard looked again at the paper his
drawn face went suddenly white.  He laid it down and with startled eyes
glanced fearfully at those two.  Would they stand together?  Did she
realize her advantage?  Could he buy her off--and for how much?  A
hundred swift questions flashed through his mind, and then Rimrock
reached over for the notice.  He gazed at it quietly and then, looking
at Mary, he gave way to a cynical smile.
</p><p>"Could you hear through a wall?" he enquired enigmatically, and
Stoddard snapped his fingers in vexation.
</p><p>"Ah, I see," he observed, "not so deaf as you seem.  Well, Miss
Fortune, may I see you alone?"
</p><p>"You may not!" she answered.  "I might show you some pity, though you
don't deserve it; so, knowing Mr. Jones as I do, I will leave the
decision to him."
</p><p>She glanced at Rimrock with a quick, radiant smile that revealed more
than she knew of her heart; but his face had suddenly gone grim.
</p><p>"Take him out and kill him," he advised vindictively.  "That's all the
advice I'll give."
</p><p>"No, I don't believe in that," she answered sweetly, "but perhaps our
decision can wait."
</p><p>"Well, you needn't wait for me," replied Rimrock ungraciously, "because
I'm through, for good and all.  The first man that gives me a check for
my stock----"
</p><p>Whitney Stoddard reached swiftly for his checkbook and pen, but she
stopped him with a warning look.
</p><p>"No, there'll be nothing like that," she answered firmly.  "But I moved
once that we declare a dividend."
</p><p>"Second the motion," murmured Stoddard resignedly; and Rimrock, too,
voted: "Ay!"
</p><p>Then he rose up sullenly and gazed at them both with a savage,
insulting glare.
</p><p>"You can keep your old mine," he said to Mary.  "I'm going to beat it
to Mexico!"
</p><p>He started for the door and they looked after him, startled, but at the
doorway he stopped and turned back.
</p><p>"Where do I get that check?" he asked and after a silence Mary answered:
</p><p>"From Mr. Lockhart."
</p><p>"Good!" he muttered and closed the door quietly, whereat Stoddard began
instantly to talk.  He might have talked a long time, or only a few
moments; and then Mary began to hear.
</p><p>"What's that?" she asked and Stoddard repeated what he considered a
very generous offer.
</p><p>"Mr. Stoddard," she cried with almost tearful vehemence, "there's only
one condition on which I'll even think of giving you back your mine,
and that is that Rimrock shall run it.  Mr. Jepson must be fired, Mr.
Jones must have full charge, and all this chicanery must stop; but if
Rimrock goes away without taking his mine I'll--I'll make you wish he
hadn't!"
</p><p>She snatched up her papers and ran out of the room and Stoddard caught
up the 'phone.
</p><p>"Give me Mr. Lockhart!" he said.  "Yes, Lockhart, the banker.  Mr.
Lockhart?  This is Mr. Stoddard.  If you pay Henry Jones a cent of that
money I'll break you, so help me God.  And listen!  If you value your
rating with Bradstreet, you make him apologize to that girl!"
