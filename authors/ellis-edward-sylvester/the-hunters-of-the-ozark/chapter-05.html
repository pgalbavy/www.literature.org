<p>Terry Clark, the Irish lad, placed his right foot behind the
left, his weight equally supported on both, and stood as rigid
as iron, with both fists clinched and half raised, in the attitude
of one holding himself ready to use nature's weapons to his utmost
ability.</p>

<p>He heard the soft moccasin press the layer of brown autumn leaves,
and the next moment the point of a knobby, painted nose came slowly
in sight around the side of the trunk, followed by the sloping
forehead, the hideous face and the shoulders of the warrior, whose
right hand was held so far to the rear with the gun that it was
the last to come into view.</p>

<p>As the Winnebago caught sight of the white-faced boy, his countenance
was disfigured by a grin that made it more repulsive than before.</p>

<p>"Oogh! brudder!&mdash;oogh! &mdash;Yenghese&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then Terry Clark let fly. He was a lusty lad, and he landed
both fists, one after another, squarely in the painted face, with
such force that the warrior was knocked completely off his feet.
He went over backward as though from the kick of a horse; but,
contrary to the hopes of his assailant, he did not let go of his
gun. Had he done so, the youth would have caught it up and shot
him before he could regain his feet.</p>

<p>The blow was most presumptuous, and would have insured the death
of the one who gave it but for the intervention of the second
Indian, who seemed to take but a couple of bounds from the tree
near which he was standing when he landed on the spot. The infuriated
Winnebago was in the act of clambering to his feet, when he caught
sight of the lithe, graceful warrior, standing only a couple of
steps away, with loaded rifle pointed at him.</p>

<p>"Dog of a Winnebago," he said in a voice slightly above an ordinary
tone; "if he harms the pale face, he shall die!"</p>

<p>There are some expressions so forcible that they can not be made
more so. The young Indian spoke in the lingo of the Winnebago,
whose totem he had recognized, but his posture, erect on his feet,
with his cocked rifle in such a position that he had only to pull
the trigger to send the bullet through the bronzed skull before
him;&mdash;all this required no words of explanation. The Winnebago
grasped the situation, and, to use the homely expression common
at this day, he saw that the other "had the drop" on him.</p>

<p>The Indian, though larger, older, heavier and stronger, was taken
at such disadvantage that he ceased his effort to rise, and looked
up at his conqueror with a helplessness so grotesque that under
other circumstances it would have caused a smile. Indeed, Terry
Clark did indulge in a slight laugh, for he saw that it was safe
to do so; the Winnebago was on the ground before his master.</p>

<p>"If ye want me to ring the old coow-bell, I'll be glad to obleege,
for the performance looks as if a little moosic would give tone
to the same. Howsumever, I'll step back and let this good looking
young gintleman run the show."</p>

<p>Thereupon Terry withdrew several paces and watched the proceedings
with a depth of interest that can be fully understood.</p>

<p>The look of the Winnebago, who was half reclining on his side,
supporting his body with the hand that grasped his gun, plainly
indicated the question that came from his lips.</p>

<p>"Why does my brother look with evil eyes on the Wolf, who has
come from the lodges of the Winnebagos? Are not all red men brothers?"</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is a Shawanoe, whose warriors have consorted with those
of the Winnebagos; but Deerfoot has left his lodge beyond the
Mississippi and lives alone in the woods. He will not hurt the
brave Winnebago who fights men, but he slays the Wolf that bites
the children of the pale faces, that have never harmed him."</p>

<p>Possibly the Wolf was inclined to argue the matter with the Shawanoe,
who had caught him at such disadvantage; but the manner and words
of Deerfoot showed that he was in no mood for discussion.</p>

<p>"What does my brother want?" asked the Winnebago, in a voice
that proved all fight had left him. The most, indeed, that he
ventured to do was gently to rub his forehead and nose, where
the fists of the sturdy Terry Clark had landed.</p>

<p>"Let the Wolf rise to his feet, but when he does so, his gun
must lie on the ground."</p>

<p>This was a harsh order, but there was no help for it; the Indian
hesitated a moment, and then, black and scowling, he slowly assumed
the upright posture, and, folding his arms across his chest, looked
in the face of the bright-eyed Deerfoot, to signify that he was
awaiting his next command.</p>

<p>"The Wolf shall now turn his face away from Deerfoot."</p>

<p>The Winnebago obeyed the order as promptly as if he were a soldier
undergoing drill.</p>

<p>"Let my brother now raise his eyes, until he sees the beech with
the white trunk," said Deerfoot, using the word "brother" for
the first time.</p>

<p>The object to which he alluded was perhaps fifty yards distant,
the light color of the bark showing only here and there among
the branches and undergrowth that happened to be less frequent
than in other directions. The Wolf signified that he recognized
the tree to which his conqueror referred.</p>

<p>"Now let my brother run; when he reaches the beech he can leap
behind it, and it will shield his body; if my brother is slow
Deerfoot may fire his gun and Wolf will never bite again."</p>

<p>The Winnebago wanted no explanation of this threat. It was hard
for him to depart, leaving his rifle, but it was harder for him
to lose his life, and he did not hesitate as to the choice. He
made one tremendous bound that carried him a dozen feet, and then
sped through the wood like a frightened deer. When he had passed
half of the intervening distance, he seemed to fancy that he was
not making satisfactory time for the Shawanoe, who, he doubtless
imagined, was standing with leveled gun, finger on the trigger.
He therefore began leaping from side to side, so as to disconcert
the aim of the dreaded Deerfoot. In the hope also of further confusing
him, he emitted several frenzied whoops, which added such grotesqueness
to the scene that Terry Clark threw back his head and made the
woods ring with laughter.</p>

<p>"I never saw a frog hop about like that, which beats any show."</p>

<p>Deerfoot did not have his rifle cocked or in position. The moment
the Wolf started, he saw how great his fright was, and, lowering
the flint of the weapon, he rested the stock on the ground and
watched the antics of the fugitive. The Shawanoe, unlike most
of his race, had a vein of humor in his composition. When Terry
broke into mirth, he too laughed, but it was simply a smile, accompanied
by a sparkle of his bright eyes which showed how much he enjoyed
the scene.</p>

<p>The moment the Wolf arrived at the beech, he darted behind it,
and for the first time looked over his shoulder. The sight could
not have been reassuring, for he continued his frenzied flight
until the keen ear of the Shawanoe could no longer hear him threshing
through the wood.</p>

<p>By this time Terry Clark had made up his mind that whoever the
new arrival might be, he was a friend. The Irish lad had not been
able to understand any of the words that passed between the two,
though their actions were eloquent enough to render much explanation
unnecessary. But a person who treated the Winnebago in such style
could not feel otherwise than friendly toward the one in whose
behalf the interference was made. Terry blushed a little as he
walked forward and reached out his honest hand.</p>

<p>"If it's all the same to ye, I'll be glad to give that purty
hand of yours an owld-fashioned shake, such as a fellow sometimes
gits when he catches the chills an' faver."</p>

<p>Deerfoot looked at the jolly lad with an odd expression, as he
gave him his hand, which, I need not say, was shaken with enthusiasm.
The young Shawanoe smiled in his own shadowy way and returned
the pressure warmly.</p>

<p>"My brother is happy," said he when the salute was finished;
"it makes the heart of Deerfoot glad that he could be his friend."</p>

<p>"Ye were a friend indade, though ye'll admit, Deerfut, that I
toppled over the spalpeen in foine style, now didn't I?"</p>

<p>"The Wolf who is a Winnebago, fell as though the lightning struck
him."</p>

<p>"How is it," asked Terry with no little curiosity, "that ye,
who are as full-blooded an Injin as the Winnebago, can talk the
English with almost as foine an accint as meself?"</p>

<p>"Deerfoot has lived among the pale faces; when he was a small
child he went with the Shawanoes to harm the white men, but they
took him prisoner; they treated him kindly, and told him about
God, who loves all His children, whether they be white or red,
or the color of the night; they showed him how to read books,
and to make his name and words on paper, so that others might
read."</p>

<p>"Can ye read and write?" asked the astonished Terry.</p>

<p>Deerfoot smiled and nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Well, well, that bates ivery thing!" said Terry, who instantly
repeated the absurd belief of many of his race, by adding, "I
didn't s'pose that an Injin could learn."</p>

<p>Without replying to the last remark, the Shawanoe, looking the
lad steadily in the eye, said, "Deerfoot has a message for Fred
Linden; does my brother know him?"</p>

<p>"Do I know him?" repeated Terry; "I know the same better than
I know mesilf; he started wid me to hunt the coow, and I rickons
that he can't be very fur away."</p>

<p>"He's coming," quietly said Deerfoot, looking off to the left
of Terry, as if about to salute a new arrival. The Irish lad wheeled
in his quick way, but his sharp eyes caught no glimpse of his
approaching friend.</p>
