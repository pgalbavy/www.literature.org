<p>It was so long since Mr. Fox had tried to catch Billy Woodchuck in
the hollow stump that Billy had begun to forget his fear of that
sly fellow. And so when he met Mr. Fox in the woods one day Billy
did not run as he had often done before. To be sure, he did not go
too near Mr. Fox. And while they talked Billy watched the
sharp-nosed gentleman with one eye; and the other eye he kept on a
hole in the stonewall nearby. If Mr. Fox should come too close,
Billy was ready to dive into that hole, where Mr. Fox could not
reach him.
</p>
<p>No one could have been pleasanter than Mr. Fox. "I'm so glad to
meet you!" he said. "You're just the person I want to see. I've
been told you are very musical."
</p><p>Billy Woodchuck didn't know what he meant. But he did not say so.
</p><p>"Yes," Mr. Fox went on. "They say you are the best whistler in
Pleasant Valley."
</p><p>That made Billy Woodchuck feel very proud.
</p><p>"I <u>can</u> whistle pretty well," he said, throwing out his chest.
</p><p>"And they tell me your two brothers are almost as good whistlers as
you are--but not <u>quite</u>," added Mr. Fox, for he saw that Billy did
not like that so well.
</p><p>"Oh, they can whistle some. But I can beat them," Billy answered.
</p><p>"I have an idea," said Mr. Fox. He really had a great many ideas in
his head--more, probably, than any other of the forest-people.
"I'm very fond of music and I want to have a fife-and-drum corps."
</p><p>"What's that? I never heard of such a thing," exclaimed Billy
Woodchuck.
</p><p>"Fifes and drums--they make music, you know," Mr. Fox explained.
"Now, everybody knows that old Mother Grouse's sons are famous
drummers."
</p><p>Billy agreed that that was true. He had often heard the Grouse boys
drumming in the woods.
</p><p>"I've already spoken to them. And they are asking me every day when
we are going to begin to practise," Mr. Fox continued. "But I
couldn't think of any fifers until I happened to remember about you
and your brothers."
</p><p>"I don't know how to play a fife," said Billy. "I've never even
seen one."
</p><p>"Oh, that's nothing! You can hold a stick up to your mouth, and
wriggle your fingers, and whistle. No one will know that you are
not playing a fife. It will sound just the same. And the music will
be just as sweet." Mr. Fox smiled at Billy. And Billy smiled at
him.
</p><p>"Good!" said Billy. "Will you bring the drummers to my house?"
</p><p>"Well--no! Not just yet!" said Mr. Fox. "We ought to go off in the
woods, where nobody can hear us, until we learn a tune. Then we can
come and play for your mother. But I wouldn't say anything to her
about the fife-and-drum corps if I were you. Let's surprise her!"
</p><p>Billy thought that was a good idea.
</p><p>"Bring your brothers over to my house late this afternoon," Mr. Fox
said. "I'll have the Grouse boys there. And we can begin to learn
to make music at once."
</p><p>"Who will teach us?" asked Billy. "Do <u>you</u> know how to drum or
whistle?"
</p><p>"Don't you worry about that!" Mr. Fox answered. "I can teach you a
thing or two." And he hurried away to find Mother Grouse's sons and
tell them the good news.
