<p>Now I do pity all the lords and great gentle-folk with nothing
in the world to do except to find out how to make things pleasant,
and new places to go to, and new ways of spending their money;
at least, I always pity them at the beginning of my holiday, though
perhaps when one first comes back to eleven months’ hard grind
in town the feeling isn’t quite so strong.</p>

<p>At any rate, I wouldn’t have changed places with the greatest
lord in the land on Tuesday morning, September 15th. I was up
as soon as it was light, and saw the sun rise over the Gray’s
Inn Lane chimney-pots; and I declare they looked quite beautiful.
I didn’t know at all before what a fine outline they make when
the rays come flat along the roofs; and mean often to get up in
time to see them by sunrise next summer; but just now it’s very
cold of mornings, and I dare say they don’t look so well. When
I put my head out of window it was quite clear and fresh, and
I thought I could smell the country.</p>

<p>I hadn’t much to do, for I had packed my bag over night; but
I went over all my things again, and changed the places of some
of them in my old bureau, (which belonged to my father, who was
clerk for forty years in one of the oldest houses in Clement’s
Inn,) and locked up all the drawers; and then I set to work to
lay breakfast for three, for I had asked my two friends to come
and see me off, and they had made it all up with my landlady.
So about six o’clock they came in, and we had a capital breakfast;
and then we started off to walk up to the Paddington station,
carrying my bag between us. I had settled to go by the 7.30 train,
because if I hadn’t they couldn’t have come with me; besides,
it is the first train which stops at Farringdon-road; and I was
very glad when we got into the bustle of the station, for they
were rather low, and I felt almost ashamed of being so jolly,
though certainly they had had their holiday earlier in the year.
But when I saw their faces out of the window of the second-class
carriage, just as the starting-bell rang, I should like to have
paid their fares out of my own pocket, if they could have gone
with me.</p>

<p>However, by the time we got past Wormwood Scrubbs, (which looked
so fresh and breezy with the gossamer lying all over it,) I could
think of nothing else but the country and my holiday. How I did
enjoy the pretty hill with the church at top and the stream at
the bottom by Hanwell, and the great old trees about half a mile
off on the right before you get to Slough, and the view of Windsor
Castle, and crossing the Thames at Maidenhead, with its splendid
weeping willows, and the old Bath-road bridge, and the reach beyond
with the woods coming down to the bank, and the great lords’ houses
up above. And then all the corn-fields, though by this time most
of them were only stubble, and Reading town, and the great lasher
at Pangbourn, where the water was rushing and dancing through
in the sunlight to welcome me into Berkshire; and the great stretches
of open land about Wallingford-road and Didcot. And after that
came great green pasture-fields, and orchards, and gray-stone
farm-houses, and before I could turn round we were at Farringdon-road
station, and it was a quarter past eleven. As I got out and gave
up my ticket, I couldn’t help thinking of the two lines Jem Fisher
would go on saying when we went out walking in Combe Wood and
Richmond Park one Sunday this last May&mdash;</p>

How beautiful the country do appear<br/>
At this time of the year.

<p>I know he was laughing, and made them out of his own head, though
he declared they were in Chaucer; but they are just as true for
all that, whether Jem Fisher or Chaucer made them, though the
English isn’t as good as the sense.</p>

<p>There I found Joe waiting for me, with his trap, as he called
it, at the door, and the inn ostler standing by the head of the
horse, which was a bright chestnut, and looked very fine. I own
I very much enjoyed going off in that dark-green high-wheeled
carriage.</p>

<p>"In with you, Dick," cried out Joe, as he took hold of the reins,
and patted the horse on the neck. "There, shoot your bag in behind;
look alive, she don’t stand well. That’ll do," he shouted to the
ostler, who jumped back and touched his hat just as if Joe owned
half the parish. If the horse couldn’t stand well, at any rate
she could step out, and away we whirled down the white road; Joe
red in the face with holding on, his feet well out to the splash-board,
his chest thrown forward, and his elbows down at his side, hauling
the chestnut’s head right back, till her nose nearly touched the
collar. But for all that, away went her legs right straight out
in front, shooting along so fast that I began to feel queer, not
being used to horses, and took tight hold of the seat with my
left hand, so that Joe shouldn’t see; for the cart jumped sometimes
enough to pitch you out.</p>

<p>"Gently there, gently, my beauty," said Joe, as the chestnut
dropped into a little quieter pace. "There, now, ain’t she a pictur’?"
said he to me;&mdash;"ever see a mare lay down to her work like that?
Gently, my beauty! if it wasn’t for the blaze in her face, and
the white feet, the Squir’d give me one hundred pounds for her
to-morrow. And I won’t sell her under. It’s a mortal shame to
drive her. Her mouth’s like a kitten’s." How Joe could talk so,
when he was pulling fit to burst himself at the reins, I don’t
know; I thought once or twice where we should go to if one broke,
but I didn’t say any thing. I found out afterwards that Joe meant
a great white mark, when he talked of the blaze in her face. I
suppose men can’t see any faults in their own horses, any more
than they can in their children.</p>

<p>After a bit, the pace got quite steady, and then I began to enjoy
myself, and could look at the famous rich fields, and the high
hedges full of great heavy masses of clematis, and sniff up all
the country smells, as we whirled along, and listen to Joe, who
was going grinding on about, ‘how badly the parish roads were
kept up; and that he had set his mind to have them well mended
with flints instead of chalk, and to have all the thistles at
the side kept down, which were sowing the whole country round,
because their vestry was so stingy they wouldn’t put any men on
the road to set it right,’ and I could see that Joe was in the
middle of a good quarrel with all the other farmers about it.</p>

<p>When he had done his story, I asked him about the White Horse,
and he pointed me out the highest of the hills which ran along
on our left hand a mile or two away. There, sure enough, I saw
the figure quite plain; but he didn’t know much about it. Only,
he said, he had always heard tell that it was cut out by King
Alfred the Great, who lived in those parts; and ‘there was a main
sight of strange old things up there on the hill, besides the
White Horse; and though he didn’t know much about how they got
there, he was sort of proud of them, and was glad to pay his pound
or two, or double that if it was wanted, to keep them as they
should be;’ "for, you see," said Joe, "we’ve lived about here,
father and son, pretty nigh ever since King Alfred’s time, which
I reckon is a smartish time ago, though I forget how long." And
though I think Joe, and parties in the counties generally, set
too much store by such things, and hold their noses much higher
than they’ve any need to do, because their families have never
cared to move about, and push on in the world, and so they know
where their great-grandfathers were born, I couldn’t help feeling
there was something in it after all.</p>

<p>And the more I thought of this strange old White Horse, the more
it took hold of me, and I resolved, if I could, while I was down
in the country to learn all about it. I knew, you see, that if
I could only get people to tell me about it, I should be able
to carry it all away; because, besides having a very good memory,
I can take down every thing that is said as fast as most people
can speak it, and that’s what gives me such an advantage over
Jem Fisher and Neddy, who spent all the time it took me to learn
shorthand in reading poetry and other rubbish, which will never
help to get them on in the world, or do them a bit of good that
I can see.</p>

<p>Presently we came in sight of a house with farm buildings behind,
which stood some way back from the road; and Joe pulled up opposite
a gate which led into the field before the house.</p>

<p>"Here we are, then," said he; "just jump out, and open the gate,
Dick; I’d do it, only I can’t trust you with the ribbons."</p>

<p>It was a beautiful great green pasture-field which we drove into,
with a score of fat sleek cows feeding in it, or lying about chewing
the cud; and Joe was very proud of them, and walked the chestnut
along slowly while he pointed out his favourites to me, especially
one short-horn, whose back he said was like a kitchen-table, though
why she should be any the handsomer for that I can’t say. The
house was an old brick building, with tall chimneys and latticed
windows; in front of it was a nice little flower-garden, with
a tall, clipped holly hedge running round it, so thick that you
couldn’t see through; and beyond that, a kitchen garden and an
orchard. Outside the enclosure stood four such elms as I never
saw before, and a walnut-tree nearly as big as they, with queer
great branches drooping close to the ground, on which some turkeys
were sitting. There was only a little wicket-gate in the holly
hedge, and a gravel footpath up to the front door, so we drove
into the farm-yard at the back; and while Joe and his man took
care of the chestnut, I had time to look about, and think what
a snug berth Joe seemed to have fallen upon.</p>

<p>The yard must be sixty yards across, and was full of straw where
the pigs were lying with nothing but their snouts out; lots of
poultry were scratching and pecking about before the barn-doors,
and pigeons were fluttering down amongst them, and then up again
to the tops of the barns and stables, which ran all round the
yard. The rick-yard, full of long stacks of hay, and round stacks
of corn, was beyond. A terrier and spaniel were sleeping in sunny
corners, and a grayhound was stalking about and looking at the
pigs; and every thing looked sleepy and happy, and as if life
went easily along at Elm Close Farm.</p>

<p>Presently Joe came out of the stable, carrying his whip, and
took me into the house, calling into the kitchen as we passed
to send in dinner directly. There was nobody in the parlour at
first, but I saw that the table was laid for three; and, before
I could look round at the prints and samples on the wall, Joe’s
mother and the dinner came in. She was a good-looking old lady,
dressed in black, with a very white lawn cap and collar, and was
very kind and civil, but a little deaf. Joe bustled about, and
got out I don’t know how many bottles of home-made wine, clary,
and raisin, and ginger; all of which he made me drink, besides
beer, for he said that no one in the vale had such receipts for
wine as his mother. And what with the dairy-fed pork, and black
puddings, and a chicken almost as big as a turkey, and the cheese-cakes
and tarts afterwards, and the hearty welcome and good example
which Joe gave me, I don’t remember when I have made so good a
dinner.</p>

<p>The old lady went off directly after dinner, and I could see
that Joe wanted to go and see after his men; so I told him not
to mind me, for I should enjoy loitering about the place better
than any thing. And so I did; first I went into the flower-garden,
and watched and listened to the bees working away so busy in the
mignonette, and the swallows darting up into their nests under
the eaves, and then diving out again, and skimming away over the
great pasture; and then round the kitchen-garden, and into the
orchard, where the trees were all loaded with apples and pears,
and so out into a stubble-field at the back, where there were
a lot of young pigs feeding and playing queer tricks, and back
through the farm-yard into the great pasture, where I lay down
on the grass, under one of the elms, and lighted my pipe; and
thought of our hot clerks’ room, and how Jem Fisher and little
Neddy were working away there; and watched a flock of little shiny
starlings hopping up on to the backs of some old south-down wethers
who were feeding near me, and flying backwards and forwards into
the old elms and walnut-trees, talking to one another all the
while.</p>

<p>And so the time wore on, till a stout lass in a blue cotton print
came out, and called the cows in to milking; and they all went
trooping slowly by into the farm-yard, some of them just stopping
to stare at me with their mild eyes, and smelling so sweet, that
I hadn’t the heart to go on smoking, and let my pipe out. And
after a bit, I followed into the line of sheds where they were
being milked by the lass and a man, who balanced himself on two
legs of the milking-stool, and drove his head into the cow’s side;
and I thought I had never heard a sweeter sound than the tinkling
sound which the milk made in the bright, tin pails.</p>

<p>I soon got into a talk with the lass, who was very pleasant and
free spoken; and presently, when her pail was full, I lifted it
out for her, all frothing up, and looking not a bit like our London
sky-blue; and I told her I didn’t think I had ever tasted real
new milk; so she got me a long straw, and while she went on milking,
I went down on my knees, and began to suck away through the straw.
But I had hardly begun, when I heard a noise behind, and looking
round, there stood Joe, laughing all over; and by his side a young
woman in a broad, straw hat and a gray jacket; and though, for
good manners, she didn’t laugh out like Joe, I could see it was
all she could do to keep from going off too.</p>

<p>Why was I ashamed of being caught? I don’t know, but I was ashamed;
and as I stuck there on my knees in the deep straw with the pail
before me looking at them, the blood rushed up to my head and
made my ears sing, so that I couldn’t hear a word that Joe said.
But I could see he did say something, and then went off into another
great roar of laughter; and the lass and the man left off milking
and began laughing too, till I thought they would have dropped
off the stools. Then the young woman who was with Joe said something
to him, and I thought I heard the words "What a shame!" and "your
oldest friend;" and then she caught up a straw, and came and knelt
on the opposite side of the milk-pail, and began to suck away
herself without looking at me. In another moment Joe plumped down
too, clapping me on the back.</p>

<p>"I say," said he, "start fair! Here, make room for me; you and
Lucy ain’t going to have it all to yourselves," and he began sucking
away too; and then I recovered myself, and we all went on for
a minute, when Joe took his straw out of his mouth, and said,
"This is my sister Lucy, Dick; there, shake hands over the pail,
and then let’s go in to tea."</p>

<p>So she looked up, and blushed, and gave me her hand, her merry
blue eyes twinkling with mirth, though she tried to keep grave.
But I was all right now, and went off myself, and Joe followed,
and then she, with the clearest, brightest laugh you ever heard;
and then the man and the lass, and by the time we had done, I
felt as if I had known them all for years. But as for Miss Lucy,
as we walked away to the house to tea, I felt as if I could have
given her my skin, if she would only have had a pair of shoes
made out of it for her dear little feet.</p>

<p>The old lady was sitting at the tea-table in great force, with
plates of buttered toast and cake, and pots of blackberry and
red-currant jam, and the great loaf all set out ready; and after
tea, we three walked out again till the sun set, and then came
in to supper, at which I was surprised to find myself eating away
just as if I had had nothing all day; country air does give one
such an appetite. After supper, the old lady sat in her chair
knitting and telling stories, till she nodded off and the spectacles
fell on to the end of her nose, and her hands into her lap, but
still holding the needles; and every now and then giving a catch
with her head, and making belief to go on for a stitch or two.
And Miss Lucy sat stitching at a patch-work coverlet, fitting
in all sorts of scraps of silk in the prettiest patterns in the
world, and we on the other side of the table watching her, and
talking quite low not to disturb the old lady. But what made it
so pleasant was, that I had pretty near all the talking, for they
seemed never tired of hearing about London, and how people lived
there, and what they thought; especially Miss Lucy, who had never
been out of Berkshire in her life. I thought Joe a great fidget,
when soon after nine he began to walk about and waked his mother,
and got the servants in to prayers, and bustled them off to bed;
but I believe it was all because he wanted to have his pipe, which
he wouldn’t smoke in the parlour. So we went into the kitchen
and finished the day there, under half a score of great brown
sides of bacon, and tufts of sweet herbs which hung drying from
the corners of the rack, and opposite to the dresser with its
rows of pewter plates as bright as silver, till I went to bed
in sheets smelling of lavender, and dreamt of Miss Lucy.</p>

<p>I dare say that, though I should never be tired of telling about
every thing that happened to me at Elm Close, some people may
get tired of reading about it. So I shall only begin my story
of the next day after breakfast, when Joe had the trap out again,
and carried me off to see what was doing up on White Horse Hill.</p>

<p>We had a very pleasant drive through the Vale to Uffington, which
lies at the foot of the hill, and here Joe put up the trap, at
the Swan, and we set off on foot to walk up. It was very hot,
and the white road glared as we tramped along it, but very soon
we came to broad strips of turf on each side, and then it was
pleasant enough; so we plodded up a gentle rise called Sour Hill,
and crossed the Iceldon or Iggleton way, which I’ve found out
since was an old Roman road; and then the ascent became quite
steep, and every thing was clear hill and down before us, not
a fence to be seen, and a fresh breeze came sweeping over the
hill.</p>

<p>The road now became very bad, with ruts in the chalk like water-courses.
On our left hand there was a deep, narrow valley like a little
bay running up into the hill, on the opposite side of which valley
a large wood hung along the steepest part of the hill-side, which
Joe informed me was Uffington wood, a well-known meet for the
hounds; it made me giddy to look at the places which he declared
the huntsman, and any one who wanted to be sure of a good place
when the hounds broke cover, had to ride along.</p>

<p>And now the great, green hill seemed to be hanging right over
us, as we came to a curious round mound on our right hand, up
which Joe scrambled, and I after him, till we both pulled up out
of breath on the flat top, some fifty yards across.</p>

<p>"This is Dragon’s Hill," said Joe, pulling off his hat and mopping
his face with his handkerchief, "where St. George killed the Dragon
in the old times. Leastways so they says about here, only they
calls him King George instead of Saint George. And this bare place
is where his blood ran out, and nothing’ll grow on it since, not
so much as a thistle."</p>

<p>Of course I knew better than to believe that, but it is a beautiful
place; for just below it another little deep valley, like the
one on the left, only narrower and steeper at the sides, runs
right up into the hill-side. The road we had left winds round
the head of this gorge, for any one to drive along who isn’t particular
about breaking his neck, for the hill is like a wall up above,
and down below, with nothing but a little bank between you and
the descent.</p>

<p>"Those are the giants’ seats opposite," said Joe, pointing across
the valley to a set of beautiful great green slopes, like huge
ridges and furrows, which went sweeping down into the valley one
after another as far as I could see; "and this is the Manger,
this great hole in the hill-side, because it lies right under
the old Horse’s nose. Come along, let’s get up to him; there he
is, you see, right above us."</p>

<p>So we scrambled down the side of Dragon’s Hill, crossed the road,
and then started up a row of steps cut in the turf. I’m sure it
must be twice as steep as the hill in Greenwich Park, and I don’t
mind confessing that I shouldn’t have liked to look round just
at first, and wouldn’t have minded giving myself a help with my
hands if I hadn’t been afraid of Joe’s seeing me and laughing.
I should think we must have gone up two hundred steps, when all
of a sudden Joe stopped just above me, and called out, "Here we
are;" and in about four steps I came to a trench cut into the
chalk about two feet deep, which ran up the hill-side right ahead
of us. The chalk in the trench was all hard and flat, and seemed
to have been scraped and brushed up quite lately.</p>

<p>"This is his tail," said Joe. "Come on; look, they’re scouring
him up above; we’re in luck &mdash;I thought they’d have done
before this; and there’s the Squire too with ’em."</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>So I looked up; and there, some way above, I saw a lot of men
with shovels, and besoms, and barrows, cleaning away at the trench,
which, now that I began to look at it, certainly came out more
and more like a horse galloping; and there amongst them, working
away as hard as any one, was a person in yellow leather gaiters,
who I saw at once must be the Squire, though I had never seen
a squire before. I own I had a great prejudice against a country
squire when I went down into Berkshire; which was natural enough,
you see, because I had never been farther from town than Twickenham
(except by boat to Margate), and had belonged to a debating society
near Farringdon-market ever since I left school, where we take
in three liberal papers, and once a week have as good speaking
as they get in the House of Commons. I haven’t been to the debates
much lately, myself; but when I was an active member, we used
to have a regular go in about once a quarter at the unpaid magistracy.
How we did give it them! They were bloated aristocrats, who by
the time they were thirty had drunk out all the little brains
they ever had, and spent their time in preserving and killing
game and foxes at the expense of the farmers, and sending every
good man in their villages either to the Bastile (as we called
the workhouse), as a pauper, or to the county jail as a poacher.</p>

<p>Joe and I very nearly quarrelled over one of those debates to
which I took him, like a great gaby as I was, when he came up
to see me at the time of a cattle-show. He would get up to speak,
all I could do to stop him; and began, all red in the face, pitching
into one of our best speakers who had just finished, calling him
a cockney, and asking him what right he had to jaw about squires
when he talked about a fox’s ears and tail, and didn’t know mangold-wurzel
from swedes. And then all our fellows began to shout and hiss,
and Joe began to swear, and wanted to take his coat off, and fight
all who had spoken; "one down, and t’other come on," as he said.
I got him out and took him home; but his blood was up, and he
would go on at our Society, and call us a set of quill-driving
jackanapes. And I couldn’t stand that, so I began at the landed
interest, and said all the bad of them I could think of, about
the Poor-Laws, game preserving, and the Corn-laws. Joe was very
near going off in a huff, but we shook hands over it at last,
and agreed that we neither of us knew much about the sort of life
the other led, and so had better not talk about it as if we did.</p>

<p>Well, this was the first squire I had ever seen, so I looked
at him with all my eyes; and if all squires were like him, I don’t
wonder at Joe’s getting in a passion at our talk in Farringdon-market.
I should think he must be about forty-five years old, and stands
not far short of six feet high; for when he came to stand by Joe,
I could see he was the taller of the two; but he didn’t look so
tall quite when he stood by himself &mdash;I suppose because his
figure was so good. For you never saw such a clean made man; he
was for all the world like a well-rounded wedge from his shoulders
down, and his neck and head put on like a statue. He looked just
as if he could have jumped the highest five-barred gate in the
Vale, and then have carried it off on his shoulders, and run up
the hill with it. And his face, which was well browned, was so
manly and frank, and his voice so cheery, and he looked you so
straight in the face, that you felt he wasn’t ashamed of any thing,
or afraid of anybody; and so you looked him back and spoke out,
and were twice as good a man at once yourself while you were talking
to him.</p>

<p>Well, when the Squire saw Joe, he stopped working away with his
shovel, and called out to him; and so Joe went up and shook hands
with him, and began talking to him, and in another minute the
Squire called for his coat&mdash;a gray tweed shooting-jacket it was&mdash;and
put it on, and took up his riding-whip, and told the men to look
alive and get their job done, and then to send up to the Castle
for some beer and bread and cheese which he would order for them.</p>

<p>Then Joe and the Squire walked away along the hill-side talking,
and I went and sat down on a little mound, just above the Horse’s
ears, and watched the men working, and looked at the view. How
I did enjoy myself! The turf was as soft as a feather bed, and
as springy as horsehair; and it was all covered with thistle down,
which came drifting along like snow with the south wind; and all
down below the country looked so rich and peaceful, stretching
out for miles and miles at my feet in the hazy sunshine, and the
larks right up overhead sang so sweetly, that I didn’t know whether
to laugh or cry. I should have liked to have had a turn at the
besoms and shovels with the men, who seemed very good-tempered,
only I was too shy, and I couldn’t make out half they said. So
I took out my pipe and lighted it, and sat looking on at the work,
and thinking of nothing.</p>

<p>Presently a gentleman whom I hadn’t noticed, but who was poking
about the place, came and sat down near me. He was dressed in
dark clothes, very quiet; I suppose he was a parson from some
of the villages near. And we began talking about the weather,
and what chance there was of having fine days for the pastime.
He was a very grave, elderly man, but easy and pleasant, and had
a keen look in his gray eyes, and a sort of twinkle about his
mouth, which made me put my best leg foremost, and take care what
I said.</p>

<p>Well, when we had done about the weather, thinks I, "This is
just the sort of gentleman to tell me what I want to know about
the White Horse and all the rest of it," and you’ll see as you
go on that I never made a better guess in my life. So I got my
note-book out quietly, so that he shouldn’t take much notice of
what I was about, and began, "I suppose, Sir," said I, "that it’s
all right about Alfred, and that he really did cut out this figure
after winning a great battle up here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "I think so myself, because there has always
been a tradition in the country side that this was so. And where
antiquaries differ, a tradition of this sort may always be pretty
safely believed. Country folk hold on to such stories, and hand
them down in a very curious manner; but you know, I dare say,
that it is claimed by some as a Druidical, or at any rate a British
monument, which would make it several hundred years older at least."</p>

<p>I didn’t know any thing about it, but why should I tell him so.
"I shouldn’t like to think so, Sir," said I, "because one wouldn’t
care so much about it if it wasn’t made by the Saxons and their
great king. The Druids don’t seem akin to us somehow; and then
one would lose all about the great battle, which was certainly
fought up here, wasn’t it, Sir?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt about it," said he; "there are many signs of
it&mdash;above all, graves enough to hold the harvest of many battles.
You are lying on one."</p>

<p>"No! am I really, though?" said I, sitting up and looking at
the ground; "how do you know?"</p>

<p>"Well, it isn’t very hard when the eye gets used to them," said
he; "there’s another;" and he pointed to a small mound a few yards
off, and just like the one I was sitting on. "That larger mound,
too, down below, across the road, you were on it just now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," said I, interrupting him, and pointing at it, "Dragon’s
Hill."</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said he; "that’s another burial-place; a larger
and grander affair, you see, than these. Probably a king or other
very noble person is buried there."</p>

<p>"The people say, Sir, don’t they," said I, "that St. George killed
the Dragon there?"</p>

<p>"They do," said he, "and that his blood made a pool on the top,
and ran down the steps on the other side, where the grass has
never grown since. This is another curious instance of the tenacity
of tradition; but here I think our good folk in the Vale have
held on to the name, or a part of it, and forgotten the meaning,
just as they have in the case of another village over there in
Oxfordshire, the name of which is Stanton Harcourt."</p>

<p>"How was that, Sir?" said I, when he paused.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, laughing, "an old man in that village told me
that a battle was fought there, which the English were very near
losing, when the general rode up to one of his captains, named
Harcourt, who was in the thick of it, and called out, ‘Stan’ to
un, Harcourt, stan’ to un, Harcourt;’ and that Harcourt won the
battle, and the village has been called Stanton Harcourt ever
since. Now, as to that mound, I believe it’s right name to be
Pendragon’s Hill. Pendragon, you know, is only a name common to
those of the kings of the ancient Britons, who were chosen leaders
in the time of national distress, and means nothing more than
‘caput regum,’ ‘the chief of kings.’ According to some, ‘Arthur’
is the same or a like word, being ‘Ardh-reg’ or ‘Ard-heer,’ and
meaning ‘summus Rex’ (whence the ‘Arviragus’ of Juvenal; but I
lay no stress on this). Now we know of at least three Pendragons.
There was Cassibelan, who was chosen Pendragon at the time of
Julius Cæsar’s invasion, Uter Pendragon, and Arthur Pendragon;
which Uter and Arthur were, without doubt, chosen to resist the
Saxons, who had won already the eastern part of the island. And
if Arthur and Pendragon are the same words, doubtless (as has
been well supposed), there were many Arthurs at this time, one
of whom was probably slain in battle and buried here.[2] For in
the Saxon annals we find that Cedric, founder of the West Saxon
kingdom, slew Natan-leod and five thousand men in these parts,
which Natan-leod (as is shown by Mr. Baxter) is ‘Naud-an-ludh,’
or ‘populi tutela,’ the people’s refuge; in fact, a kindred word
to ‘Pendragon,’ or ‘Arthur.’ You see how probable this would be
<em>primâ facie</em>?" said he, turning round to me.</p>

<p>My goodness! I couldn’t make out head or tail of his long words,
and was staring at him with my mouth open; but when he turned
round I shut it pretty quick, and looked as wise as I could. "Well,
Sir," said I, "I hardly know; but it doesn’t look unlikely, does
it?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said he, quite pleased; "and as the Britons
were not driven from these parts till the middle of the sixth
century, I should put the throwing up of Dragon’s Hill in the
beginning, say the first half, of that century. Now, in the year
<em>A.D. 520, </em>according to Gildas and Bede, Arthur gained
his twelfth victory at ‘Mons Badonicus,’ which might very well
be Baydon Hill, which you see over there." And he pointed to a
hill three or four miles off.</p>

<p>"But then, Sir," said I, "if he gained the victory, he wasn’t
killed there, I suppose, and so he couldn’t be buried here."</p>

<p>"But he was killed in battle at last," said he; "and, as I told
you, there must have been many Arthurs or Pendragons just at that
time, and many battles fought between this and Bath&mdash;why, the
Britons gained a battle at Wanborough, over there, as late as
<em>A.D. 581</em>."</p>

<p>"But, Sir," said I, "if Pendragon was buried down there, wouldn’t
they have been very likely to cut out the horse up here just above,
as another monument, at the same time; and then what becomes of
King Alfred and the Danes?"</p>

<p>"There is no instance of two such monuments over one chief,"
answered he, quite positive; but I thought I saw him give a twinkle
with his mouth, as if he felt I had been pretty near him. "Besides,
as I said before, the tradition as to the White Horse is too strong
to be upset by conjecture."</p>

<p>"I didn’t mean to conjecture, I’m sure, Sir," said I; and I thought,
though I didn’t say so, it was he who had been conjecturing pretty
freely, if it came to that. "The battle of Ashdown, Sir, was a
very great battle then," I went on, for I liked to hear him talk
about those old times, though I didn’t quite understand all he
said.</p>

<p>"The greatest battle probably in which Alfred ever was," said
he.</p>

<p>"Please, Sir," said I, "I hope you won’t think me troublesome,
but if you would only tell me about the battle I should be so
much obliged to you."</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, looking at me rather surprised, "it is seldom
that I can get any of the youth of this day to take an interest
in these matters, the study of which would greatly benefit their
manners and morals. I shall be pleased to do what you wish. Are
you a good listener?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," said I, "you will get tired of talking long before
I shall of listening. And you wouldn’t mind, I hope, my taking
notes of the story?"</p>

<p>"By no means," said he; "I see you are ready with your pen. Perhaps
I shouldn’t have told you so much about Pendragon and Natan-leod
if I had seen that you were taking me down; but now I will be
careful to give you nothing which is not to be found in the most
trustworthy chroniclers. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," said I; and then he settled himself in the turf,
and pulled a couple of old brown books out of his long coat-tail
pockets, to which he sometimes referred, and looking out over
the Vale, as if he were travelling in his mind far away from me
and every thing about us on the hill-side, began as follows.</p>

<p>[2] E. Martin Atkins, Esq., of Kingston Lisle, has lately been
opening the barrows which are nearest to the Horse; and the compiler,
hearing that he was about to examine Dragon’s Hill also, wrote
to him on the subject, and suggested how desirable it would be
(if any ways possible) to find the remains of King Bægseek there
who was slain at Ashdown. To which communication the compiler
received the following reply. After mentioning the contents of
the other barrows, some clearly Saxon, others Romano-British,
his letter proceeds as to Dragon’s Hill:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As for old Bægseek, I should chuck him overboard at once, and
assume that our friend Uter Pendragon’s remains had been originally
deposited here, but that he had been disturbed in his repose by
the decapitation of the barrow, which at some unknown time has
undoubtedly taken place. It is unfortunate, however, that a Roman
coin of the time of Constans turned up from among the débris,
and the fragments of pottery also were chiefly of Roman manufacture,
mixed with some of earlier date. It will therefore perhaps be
difficult to reconcile these matters one with the other; but on
turning them over in your mind, you will, I dare say, <em>theorize
with a very agreeable correctness</em>!" What is a wretched compiler
to do, who gets such letters from those who should be his aiders
and abettors?</p>
