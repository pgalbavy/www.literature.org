<p>
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<BR>
     They pursued it with forks and hope;<BR>
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<BR>
     They charmed it with smiles and soap.
<P>
And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new<BR>
     It was matter for general remark,<BR>
Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view<BR>
     In his zeal to discover the Snark
<P>
But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,<BR>
     A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh<BR>
And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,<BR>
     For he knew it was useless to fly.
<P>
He offered large discount--he offered a check<BR>
     (Drawn "to bearer") for seven-pounds-ten:<BR>
But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck<BR>
     And grabbed at the Banker again.
<P>
Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws<BR>
     Went savagely snapping around-<BR>
He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,<BR>
     Till fainting he fell to the ground.
<P>
The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared<BR>
     Led on by that fear-stricken yell:<BR>
And the Bellman remarked "It is just as I feared!"<BR>
     And solemnly tolled on his bell.
<P>
He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace<BR>
     The least likeness to what he had been:<BR>
While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white-<BR>
     A wonderful thing to be seen!
<P>
To the horror of all who were present that day.<BR>
     He uprose in full evening dress,<BR>
And with senseless grimaces endeavored to say<BR>
     What his tongue could no longer express.
<P>
Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his hair--<BR>
     And chanted in mimsiest tones<BR>
Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,<BR>
     While he rattled a couple of bones.
<P>
"Leave him here to his fate--it is getting so late!"<BR>
     The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.<BR>
"We have lost half the day.  Any further delay,<BR>
     And we sha'nt catch a Snark before night!"
