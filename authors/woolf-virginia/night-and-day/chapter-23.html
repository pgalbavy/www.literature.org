<p>When Ralph Denham entered the room and saw Katharine seated with
her back to him, he was conscious of a change in the grade of
the atmosphere such as a traveler meets with sometimes upon the
roads, particularly after sunset, when, without warning, he runs
from clammy chill to a hoard of unspent warmth in which the sweetness
of hay and beanfield is cherished, as if the sun still shone although
the moon is up. He hesitated; he shuddered; he walked elaborately
to the window and laid aside his coat. He balanced his stick most
carefully against the folds of the curtain. Thus occupied with
his own sensations and preparations, he had little time to observe
what either of the other two was feeling. Such symptoms of agitation
as he might perceive (and they had left their tokens in brightness
of eye and pallor of cheeks) seemed to him well befitting the
actors in so great a drama as that of Katharine Hilbery’s daily
life. Beauty and passion were the breath of her being, he thought.</p>

<p>She scarcely noticed his presence, or only as it forced her to
adopt a manner of composure, which she was certainly far from
feeling. William, however, was even more agitated than she was,
and her first instalment of promised help took the form of some
commonplace upon the age of the building or the architect’s name,
which gave him an excuse to fumble in a drawer for certain designs,
which he laid upon the table between the three of them.</p>

<p>Which of the three followed the designs most carefully it would
be difficult to tell, but it is certain that not one of the three
found for the moment anything to say. Years of training in a drawing-room
came at length to Katharine’s help, and she said something suitable,
at the same moment withdrawing her hand from the table because
she perceived that it trembled. William agreed effusively; Denham
corroborated him, speaking in rather high-pitched tones; they
thrust aside the plans, and drew nearer to the fireplace.</p>

<p>"I’d rather live here than anywhere in the whole of London,"
said Denham.</p>

<p>("And I’ve got nowhere to live") Katharine thought, as she agreed
aloud.</p>

<p>"You could get rooms here, no doubt, if you wanted to," Rodney
replied.</p>

<p>"But I’m just leaving London for good &mdash;I’ve taken that
cottage I was telling you about." The announcement seemed to convey
very little to either of his hearers.</p>

<p>"Indeed?&mdash;that’s sad.... You must give me your address. But you
won’t cut yourself off altogether, surely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You’ll be moving, too, I suppose," Denham remarked.</p>

<p>William showed such visible signs of floundering that Katharine
collected herself and asked:</p>

<p>"Where is the cottage you’ve taken?"</p>

<p>In answering her, Denham turned and looked at her. As their eyes
met, she realized for the first time that she was talking to Ralph
Denham, and she remembered, without recalling any details, that
she had been speaking of him quite lately, and that she had reason
to think ill of him. What Mary had said she could not remember,
but she felt that there was a mass of knowledge in her mind which
she had not had time to examine&mdash;knowledge now lying on the far
side of a gulf. But her agitation flashed the queerest lights
upon her past. She must get through the matter in hand, and then
think it out in quiet. She bent her mind to follow what Ralph
was saying. He was telling her that he had taken a cottage in
Norfolk, and she was saying that she knew, or did not know, that
particular neighborhood. But after a moment’s attention her mind
flew to Rodney, and she had an unusual, indeed unprecedented,
sense that they were in touch and shared each other’s thoughts.
If only Ralph were not there, she would at once give way to her
desire to take William’s hand, then to bend his head upon her
shoulder, for this was what she wanted to do more than anything
at the moment, unless, indeed, she wished more than anything to
be alone&mdash;yes, that was what she wanted. She was sick to death
of these discussions; she shivered at the effort to reveal her
feelings. She had forgotten to answer. William was speaking now.</p>

<p>"But what will you find to do in the country?" she asked at random,
striking into a conversation which she had only half heard, in
such a way as to make both Rodney and Denham look at her with
a little surprise. But directly she took up the conversation,
it was William’s turn to fall silent. He at once forgot to listen
to what they were saying, although he interposed nervously at
intervals, "Yes, yes, yes."  As the minutes passed, Ralph’s presence
became more and more intolerable to him, since there was so much
that he must say to Katharine; the moment he could not talk to
her, terrible doubts, unanswerable questions accumulated, which
he must lay before Katharine, for she alone could help him now.
Unless he could see her alone, it would be impossible for him
ever to sleep, or to know what he had said in a moment of madness,
which was not altogether mad, or was it mad? He nodded his head,
and said, nervously, "Yes, yes," and looked at Katharine, and
thought how beautiful she looked; there was no one in the world
that he admired more. There was an emotion in her face which lent
it an expression he had never seen there. Then, as he was turning
over means by which he could speak to her alone, she rose, and
he was taken by surprise, for he had counted on the fact that
she would outstay Denham. His only chance, then, of saying something
to her in private, was to take her downstairs and walk with her
to the street. While he hesitated, however, overcome with the
difficulty of putting one simple thought into words when all his
thoughts were scattered about, and all were too strong for utterance,
he was struck silent by something that was still more unexpected.
Denham got up from his chair, looked at Katharine, and said:</p>

<p>"I’m going, too. Shall we go together?"</p>

<p>And before William could see any way of detaining him&mdash;or would
it be better to detain Katharine?&mdash;he had taken his hat, stick,
and was holding the door open for Katharine to pass out. The most
that William could do was to stand at the head of the stairs and
say good-night. He could not offer to go with them. He could not
insist that she should stay. He watched her descend, rather slowly,
owing to the dusk of the staircase, and he had a last sight of
Denham’s head and of Katharine’s head near together, against the
panels, when suddenly a pang of acute jealousy overcame him, and
had he not remained conscious of the slippers upon his feet, he
would have run after them or cried out. As it was he could not
move from the spot. At the turn of the staircase Katharine turned
to look back, trusting to this last glance to seal their compact
of good friendship. Instead of returning her silent greeting,
William grinned back at her a cold stare of sarcasm or of rage.</p>

<p>She stopped dead for a moment, and then descended slowly into
the court. She looked to the right and to the left, and once up
into the sky. She was only conscious of Denham as a block upon
her thoughts. She measured the distance that must be traversed
before she would be alone. But when they came to the Strand no
cabs were to be seen, and Denham broke the silence by saying:</p>

<p>"There seem to be no cabs. Shall we walk on a little?"</p>

<p>"Very well," she agreed, paying no attention to him.</p>

<p>Aware of her preoccupation, or absorbed in his own thoughts,
Ralph said nothing further; and in silence they walked some distance
along the Strand. Ralph was doing his best to put his thoughts
into such order that one came before the rest, and the determination
that when he spoke he should speak worthily, made him put off
the moment of speaking till he had found the exact words and even
the place that best suited him. The Strand was too busy. There
was too much risk, also, of finding an empty cab. Without a word
of explanation he turned to the left, down one of the side streets
leading to the river. On no account must they part until something
of the very greatest importance had happened. He knew perfectly
well what he wished to say, and had arranged not only the substance,
but the order in which he was to say it. Now, however, that he
was alone with her, not only did he find the difficulty of speaking
almost insurmountable, but he was aware that he was angry with
her for thus disturbing him, and casting, as it was so easy for
a person of her advantages to do, these phantoms and pitfalls
across his path. He was determined that he would question her
as severely as he would question himself; and make them both,
once and for all, either justify her dominance or renounce it.
But the longer they walked thus alone, the more he was disturbed
by the sense of her actual presence. Her skirt blew; the feathers
in her hat waved; sometimes he saw her a step or two ahead of
him, or had to wait for her to catch him up.</p>

<p>The silence was prolonged, and at length drew her attention to
him. First she was annoyed that there was no cab to free her from
his company; then she recalled vaguely something that Mary had
said to make her think ill of him; she could not remember what,
but the recollection, combined with his masterful ways&mdash;why did
he walk so fast down this side street?&mdash;made her more and more
conscious of a person of marked, though disagreeable, force by
her side. She stopped and, looking round her for a cab, sighted
one in the distance. He was thus precipitated into speech.</p>

<p>"Should you mind if we walked a little farther?" he asked. "There’s
something I want to say to you."</p>

<p>"Very well," she replied, guessing that his request had something
to do with Mary Datchet.</p>

<p>"It’s quieter by the river," he said, and instantly he crossed
over. "I want to ask you merely this," he began. But he paused
so long that she could see his head against the sky; the slope
of his thin cheek and his large, strong nose were clearly marked
against it. While he paused, words that were quite different from
those he intended to use presented themselves.</p>

<p>"I’ve made you my standard ever since I saw you. I’ve dreamt
about you; I’ve thought of nothing but you; you represent to me
the only reality in the world."</p>

<p>His words, and the queer strained voice in which he spoke them,
made it appear as if he addressed some person who was not the
woman beside him, but some one far away.</p>

<p>"And now things have come to such a pass that, unless I can speak
to you openly, I believe I shall go mad. I think of you as the
most beautiful, the truest thing in the world," he continued,
filled with a sense of exaltation, and feeling that he had no
need now to choose his words with pedantic accuracy, for what
he wanted to say was suddenly become plain to him.</p>

<p>"I see you everywhere, in the stars, in the river; to me you’re
everything that exists; the reality of everything. Life, I tell
you, would be impossible without you. And now I want&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had heard him so far with a feeling that she had dropped
some material word which made sense of the rest. She could hear
no more of this unintelligible rambling without checking him.
She felt that she was overhearing what was meant for another.</p>

<p>"I don’t understand," she said. "You’re saying things that you
don’t mean."</p>

<p>"I mean every word I say," he replied, emphatically. He turned
his head towards her. She recovered the words she was searching
for while he spoke. "Ralph Denham is in love with you." They came
back to her in Mary Datchet’s voice. Her anger blazed up in her.</p>

<p>"I saw Mary Datchet this afternoon," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He made a movement as if he were surprised or taken aback, but
answered in a moment:</p>

<p>"She told you that I had asked her to marry me, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No!" Katharine exclaimed, in surprise.</p>

<p>"I did though. It was the day I saw you at Lincoln," he continued.
"I had meant to ask her to marry me, and then I looked out of
the window and saw you. After that I didn’t want to ask any one
to marry me. But I did it; and she knew I was lying, and refused
me. I thought then, and still think, that she cares for me. I
behaved very badly. I don’t defend myself."</p>

<p>"No," said Katharine, "I should hope not. There’s no defence
that I can think of. If any conduct is wrong, that is." She spoke
with an energy that was directed even more against herself than
against him. "It seems to me," she continued, with the same energy,
"that people are bound to be honest. There’s no excuse for such
behavior." She could now see plainly before her eyes the expression
on Mary Datchet’s face.</p>

<p>After a short pause, he said:</p>

<p>"I am not telling you that I am in love with you. I am not in
love with you."</p>

<p>"I didn’t think that," she replied, conscious of some bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I have not spoken a word to you that I do not mean," he added.</p>

<p>"Tell me then what it is that you mean," she said at length.</p>

<p>As if obeying a common instinct, they both stopped and, bending
slightly over the balustrade of the river, looked into the flowing
water.</p>

<p>"You say that we’ve got to be honest," Ralph began. "Very well.
I will try to tell you the facts; but I warn you, you’ll think
me mad. It’s a fact, though, that since I first saw you four or
five months ago I have made you, in an utterly absurd way, I expect,
my ideal. I’m almost ashamed to tell you what lengths I’ve gone
to. It’s become the thing that matters most in my life." He checked
himself. "Without knowing you, except that you’re beautiful, and
all that, I’ve come to believe that we’re in some sort of agreement;
that we’re after something together; that we see something....
I’ve got into the habit of imagining you; I’m always thinking
what you’d say or do; I walk along the street talking to you;
I dream of you. It’s merely a bad habit, a schoolboy habit, day-dreaming;
it’s a common experience; half one’s friends do the same; well,
those are the facts."</p>

<p>Simultaneously, they both walked on very slowly.</p>

<p>"If you were to know me you would feel none of this," she said.
"We don’t know each other&mdash;we’ve always been&mdash;interrupted....
Were you going to tell me this that day my aunts came?" she asked,
recollecting the whole scene.</p>

<p>He bowed his head.</p>

<p>"The day you told me of your engagement," he said.</p>

<p>She thought, with a start, that she was no longer engaged.</p>

<p>"I deny that I should cease to feel this if I knew you," he went
on. "I should feel it more reasonably&mdash;that’s all. I shouldn’t
talk the kind of nonsense I’ve talked to-night.... But it wasn’t
nonsense. It was the truth," he said doggedly. "It’s the important
thing. You can force me to talk as if this feeling for you were
an hallucination, but all our feelings are that. The best of them
are half illusions. Still," he added, as if arguing to himself,
"if it weren’t as real a feeling as I’m capable of, I shouldn’t
be changing my life on your account."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"I told you. I’m taking a cottage. I’m giving up my profession."</p>

<p>"On my account?" she asked, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, on your account," he replied. He explained his meaning
no further.</p>

<p>"But I don’t know you or your circumstances," she said at last,
as he remained silent.</p>

<p>"You have no opinion about me one way or the other?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose I have an opinion&mdash;" she hesitated.</p>

<p>He controlled his wish to ask her to explain herself, and much
to his pleasure she went on, appearing to search her mind.</p>

<p>"I thought that you criticized me&mdash;perhaps disliked me. I thought
of you as a person who judges&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; I’m a person who feels," he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Tell me, then, what has made you do this?" she asked, after
a break.</p>

<p>He told her in an orderly way, betokening careful preparation,
all that he had meant to say at first; how he stood with regard
to his brothers and sisters; what his mother had said, and his
sister Joan had refrained from saying; exactly how many pounds
stood in his name at the bank; what prospect his brother had of
earning a livelihood in America; how much of their income went
on rent, and other details known to him by heart. She listened
to all this, so that she could have passed an examination in it
by the time Waterloo Bridge was in sight; and yet she was no more
listening to it than she was counting the paving-stones at her
feet. She was feeling happier than she had felt in her life. If
Denham could have seen how visibly books of algebraic symbols,
pages all speckled with dots and dashes and twisted bars, came
before her eyes as they trod the Embankment, his secret joy in
her attention might have been dispersed. She went on, saying,
"Yes, I see.... But how would that help you?... Your brother has
passed his examination?" so sensibly, that he had constantly to
keep his brain in check; and all the time she was in fancy looking
up through a telescope at white shadow-cleft disks which were
other worlds, until she felt herself possessed of two bodies,
one walking by the river with Denham, the other concentrated to
a silver globe aloft in the fine blue space above the scum of
vapors that was covering the visible world. She looked at the
sky once, and saw that no star was keen enough to pierce the flight
of watery clouds now coursing rapidly before the west wind. She
looked down hurriedly again. There was no reason, she assured
herself, for this feeling of happiness; she was not free; she
was not alone; she was still bound to earth by a million fibres;
every step took her nearer home. Nevertheless, she exulted as
she had never exulted before. The air was fresher, the lights
more distinct, the cold stone of the balustrade colder and harder,
when by chance or purpose she struck her hand against it. No feeling
of annoyance with Denham remained; he certainly did not hinder
any flight she might choose to make, whether in the direction
of the sky or of her home; but that her condition was due to him,
or to anything that he had said, she had no consciousness at all.</p>

<p>They were now within sight of the stream of cabs and omnibuses
crossing to and from the Surrey side of the river; the sound of
the traffic, the hooting of motor-horns, and the light chime of
tram-bells sounded more and more distinctly, and, with the increase
of noise, they both became silent. With a common instinct they
slackened their pace, as if to lengthen the time of semi-privacy
allowed them. To Ralph, the pleasure of these last yards of the
walk with Katharine was so great that he could not look beyond
the present moment to the time when she should have left him.
He had no wish to use the last moments of their companionship
in adding fresh words to what he had already said. Since they
had stopped talking, she had become to him not so much a real
person, as the very woman he dreamt of; but his solitary dreams
had never produced any such keenness of sensation as that which
he felt in her presence. He himself was also strangely transfigured.
He had complete mastery of all his faculties. For the first time
he was in possession of his full powers. The vistas which opened
before him seemed to have no perceptible end. But the mood had
none of the restlessness or feverish desire to add one delight
to another which had hitherto marked, and somewhat spoilt, the
most rapturous of his imaginings. It was a mood that took such
clear-eyed account of the conditions of human life that he was
not disturbed in the least by the gliding presence of a taxicab,
and without agitation he perceived that Katharine was conscious
of it also, and turned her head in that direction. Their halting
steps acknowledged the desirability of engaging the cab; and they
stopped simultaneously, and signed to it.</p>

<p>"Then you will let me know your decision as soon as you can?"
he asked, with his hand on the door.</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment. She could not immediately recall
what the question was that she had to decide.</p>

<p>"I will write," she said vaguely. "No," she added, in a second,
bethinking her of the difficulties of writing anything decided
upon a question to which she had paid no attention, "I don’t see
how to manage it."</p>

<p>She stood looking at Denham, considering and hesitating, with
her foot upon the step. He guessed her difficulties; he knew in
a second that she had heard nothing; he knew everything that she
felt.</p>

<p>"There’s only one place to discuss things satisfactorily that
I know of," he said quickly; "that’s Kew."</p>

<p>"Kew?"</p>

<p>"Kew," he repeated, with immense decision. He shut the door and
gave her address to the driver. She instantly was conveyed away
from him, and her cab joined the knotted stream of vehicles, each
marked by a light, and indistinguishable one from the other. He
stood watching for a moment, and then, as if swept by some fierce
impulse, from the spot where they had stood, he turned, crossed
the road at a rapid pace, and disappeared.</p>

<p>He walked on upon the impetus of this last mood of almost supernatural
exaltation until he reached a narrow street, at this hour empty
of traffic and passengers. Here, whether it was the shops with
their shuttered windows, the smooth and silvered curve of the
wood pavement, or a natural ebb of feeling, his exaltation slowly
oozed and deserted him. He was now conscious of the loss that
follows any revelation; he had lost something in speaking to Katharine,
for, after all, was the Katharine whom he loved the same as the
real Katharine? She had transcended her entirely at moments; her
skirt had blown, her feather waved, her voice spoken; yes, but
how terrible sometimes the pause between the voice of one’s dreams
and the voice that comes from the object of one’s dreams! He felt
a mixture of disgust and pity at the figure cut by human beings
when they try to carry out, in practice, what they have the power
to conceive. How small both he and Katharine had appeared when
they issued from the cloud of thought that enveloped them! He
recalled the small, inexpressive, commonplace words in which they
had tried to communicate with each other; he repeated them over
to himself. By repeating Katharine’s words, he came in a few moments
to such a sense of her presence that he worshipped her more than
ever. But she was engaged to be married, he remembered with a
start. The strength of his feeling was revealed to him instantly,
and he gave himself up to an irresistible rage and sense of frustration.
The image of Rodney came before him with every circumstance of
folly and indignity. That little pink-cheeked dancing-master to
marry Katharine? that gibbering ass with the face of a monkey
on an organ? that posing, vain, fantastical fop? with his tragedies
and his comedies, his innumerable spites and prides and pettinesses?
Lord! marry Rodney! She must be as great a fool as he was. His
bitterness took possession of him, and as he sat in the corner
of the underground carriage, he looked as stark an image of unapproachable
severity as could be imagined. Directly he reached home he sat
down at his table, and began to write Katharine a long, wild,
mad letter, begging her for both their sakes to break with Rodney,
imploring her not to do what would destroy for ever the one beauty,
the one truth, the one hope; not to be a traitor, not to be a
deserter, for if she were&mdash;and he wound up with a quiet and brief
assertion that, whatever she did or left undone, he would believe
to be the best, and accept from her with gratitude. He covered
sheet after sheet, and heard the early carts starting for London
before he went to bed.</p>
