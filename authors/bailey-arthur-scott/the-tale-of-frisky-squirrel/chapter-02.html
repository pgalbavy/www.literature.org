<p>One day Frisky Squirrel came upon Jasper Jay's nest when Jasper and
his wife were both away from home. And Frisky simply couldn't resist
tearing a few twigs out of it. He had not done much damage, however,
before Mrs. Jay returned. When she saw what was happening she screamed
loudly for her husband. And soon Jasper came flying up as fast as he
could come. He made a noise exactly like a red-tailed hawk; but he did
not frighten Frisky at all, for Frisky knew all of Jasper's tricks.
Jasper Jay was always trying to scare people by calling like bigger
birds--such as red-shouldered hawks, and red-tailed hawks, and sparrow
hawks.
</p>
<p>When Frisky heard him calling he just laughed and skipped up the trunk
of the tree, with Jasper and his wife chasing him. Now, with Jasper
and Mrs. Jay both flying at him, Frisky had to be sprier than ever.
But he was not afraid. He never thought of danger at all. And he ran
down the thick tree-trunk like a flash and bounded across the ground
and tore up the tree where he and his mother lived.
</p><p>"I'll peck your eyes out!" Jasper shouted, as he followed close behind
Frisky. Now, no matter how bold one may be, it is not pleasant to hear
a thing like that said. And it made Frisky hurry a little faster.
</p><p>"I'll peck his tongue out!" screamed Mrs. Jay. And somehow it
disturbed Frisky the least bit to hear Jasper's wife say that. He
decided that he would go home at once. And he gave a great spring
toward the hollow limb where he lived.
</p><p>Then something happened that was a great surprise to Frisky Squirrel.
He was right in the middle of his leap when Jasper struck him with a
wing. The blow did not hurt Frisky. But it sent him tumbling. He
missed the hollow limb, and down he went, head over heels, toward the
ground.
</p><p>Even while he was falling, Frisky Squirrel laughed. You see, he
thought it was a good joke on himself. And being a merry little
fellow, he was always ready to laugh when anybody played a joke on
him. As for the fall, that did not trouble him at all. He knew that he
could land on his feet.
</p><p>It was after he had lighted upon the ground that Frisky was really
frightened. For when he looked up, whom should he see but Tommy Fox,
not three jumps away! And Tommy Fox was smiling in the most horrid
fashion, as if to say--"Ah! I've got you now, my fine fellow!" And then
Tommy Fox leaped.
</p><p>But quick as Tommy was, Frisky Squirrel was even quicker. While Tommy
was making one big leap, Frisky was making three smaller leaps. And
when Tommy came down on the spot where Frisky had been he found
nothing but a heap of dry leaves beneath his paws; and in a moment
more Frisky Squirrel's gray tail was disappearing through the doorway
of his mother's house.
</p><p>It was very unlucky for Tommy Fox; but then, one might say that it was
very lucky for Frisky Squirrel.
