<p>Among the fifty-eight regiments of Zouaves and the seven regiments
of Lancers enlisted in the service of the United States between
1861 and 1865 it will be useless for the reader to look for any
record of the 3d Zouaves or of the 8th Lancers.  The red breeches
and red fezzes of the Zouaves clothed many a dead man on Southern
battle-fields; the scarlet swallow-tailed pennon of the Lancers
fluttered from many a lance-tip beyond the Potomac; the histories
of these sixty-five regiments are known.  But no history of the
3d Zouaves or of the 8th Lancers has ever been written save in
this narrative; and historians and veterans would seek in vain
for any records of these two regiments&mdash;regiments which might
have been, but never were.</p>
