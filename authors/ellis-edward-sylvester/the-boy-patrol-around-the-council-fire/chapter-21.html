<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>On the evening of one Thursday in August, Scout Master Hall and
the members of the three patrols composing the troop of Boy Scouts
were lounging on the piazza of the bungalow or clubhouse which
stands on the shore of Gosling Lake in Southern Maine. It was
the day succeeding the departure of George Burton and his bloodhound
Zip.</p>

<p>The hours had been busy ones for our young friends. There had
been fishing, strolls through the woods, investigation of the
different kinds of trees, the study of birds, besides a "deer
hunt." I hasten to say that this was not a real hunt, a dummy
being used with bows and arrows as weapons. This is one of the
most popular forms of amusements among Boy Scouts, who enjoy it
to the full.</p>

<p>So when the youths came back to headquarters, they brought keen
appetites, overflowing spirits and healthy tired bodies. The gathering
on the piazza was a pleasing reunion of all the members. There
were experiences to be told, good natured chaffing, the laying
of plans for the morrow, and now and then Mike Murphy, in answer
to the unanimous demand, sang for them. As I have already said,
this remarkable youth, despite his unrestrainable waggery, would
never sing anything of a frivolous or "rag time" nature, but inclined
to sentimental or religious themes. When that marvelous voice
of his, like the notes of a Stradivarius violin in the hands of
Ole Bull, or Spohr, or Kubelik, was wafted across the placid lake,
it was easy to believe the story of the sirens of Lorelei.</p>

<p>Thus the party was grouped on the night I have named, and the
hum and chatter of conversation was at its height, when Scout
Master Hall exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>Every voice was instantly hushed. In the gloom the leader’s arm
which he had instinctively extended could not be seen, but naturally
all who were not already looking out upon the water did so. Every
one was in time to see a swift ascending rocket turn and break
into a shower of sparks as it dived downward again.</p>

<p>It was still in sight when a second whirred upward for two hundred
feet or more, leaving a streaming, dazzling trail as it circled
over, exploded and the stick plunged downward in the darkness.</p>

<p>Every one held his breath. Most of them rose and stared. It might
be that the physician was sending up the rockets to amuse his
daughter. If there were only two, they would mean nothing more;
if there was another——</p>

<p>"There it is!" gasped Scout Master Hall; "something is wrong
at Doctor Spellman’s!"</p>

<p>It was the signal which had been agreed upon in the event of
their friend finding himself in urgent need of help.</p>

<p>It seemed as if several minutes passed before, through the tomb-like
hush, stole a faint popping sound,—the report of the explosion
ending its journey across the lake.</p>

<p>The dull, almost inaudible call acted as if it were a bugle blast.
The whole party dashed off the porch and at headlong speed to
the two canoes drawn upon the beach. Even Jack Crandall swung
to the steps, and debated a moment whether he should not join
the party of rescue, but his common sense told him he would be
only a hindrance, and he reluctantly stayed behind and watched
the shadowy forms of his friends as shown in the star gleam, the
moon not yet having risen.</p>

<p>"He has called for us," said Scout Master Hall, "and there isn’t
a minute to lose!"</p>

<p>Standing on the edge of the lake he gave his commands as coolly
as an officer marshaling his forces for a charge. In a twinkling
the two boats were afloat in the deep water which came close to
the bank.</p>

<p>"There are twenty-one of us; each canoe will carry no more than
eight; the other five must hurry along the shore to the doctor’s
house."</p>

<p>The lads stood breathless, waiting for the leader to name those
who must walk. He promptly did so:</p>

<p>"Isaac Rothstein, Hoke Butler, Gerald Hume, Arthur Mitchell,
Gordon Calhoun."</p>

<p>It was a keen disappointment to the five, but there was not a
murmur.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys," called Hoke; "if we do our best we shall not
be far behind them."</p>

<p>His long legs carried him at a pace that made it hard for the
others to equal. In Indian file the procession, with him in the
lead, loped along the beach and was speedily swallowed up in the
obscurity.</p>

<p>The crews of the canoes worked like beavers. In a twinkling the
boys had adjusted themselves and in each boat the two who were
handiest with the paddles plyed them vigorously. Scout Master
Hall was seated in the stern of one, among his companions being
Mike Murphy, Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes.</p>

<p>At the moment the two craft put out from shore, Mike Murphy repeated
the exclamation—</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>The startling performance of a few minutes before was repeated.
One, two, three rockets streamed upward in the heavens, curved
over, exploded and plunged downward among the trees.</p>

<p>"What can be the trouble?" was the question which everyone of
the rescuers asked himself, as the oarsmen threw their energies
into the task, and sent the heavily-laden craft with the utmost
speed across the lake toward the home of their friend.</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester swung the paddles in their canoe, which speedily
assumed a slight lead. There was little or no conversation, but
each Boy Scout was busy with his thoughts, and burning with curiosity
to learn the cause of the strange night call across the lake.
Since every one knew of the doings of the two tramps, who had
been lurking in the vicinity for several days and had been seen
the previous afternoon, it was natural that suspicion should turn
to them.</p>

<p>And yet it was hard to imagine a situation in which so plucky
a man as Doctor Spellman, who owned a revolver and a repeating
rifle, would have any fear of two unarmed vagrants. Impulsive
by nature, and already resentful toward them, he would stand no
nonsense at their hands.</p>

<p>And for a third time were three signal rockets sent streaming
aloft, before the canoes had passed half the distance between
the bungalow and the home of the physician. The urgency of the
summons filled all with anguish. Mike and the Patrol Leader offered
to relieve Alvin and Chester with the paddles, but they would
not listen and bent resolutely to their task. The other canoe
had pulled up alongside, and the two kept abreast with barely
ten feet separating them.</p>

<p>The cause of the call of distress was revealed with startling
suddenness and before the craft reached land. Through the gloom,
Mike Murphy caught the vague outlines of a man and woman on the
beach, and he shouted:</p>

<p>"What’s the matter, docther?"</p>

<p>The reply of itself was a partial answer:</p>

<p>"Is Ruth at the bungalow?"</p>

<p>"She hasn’t been there since ye brought her over the other day."</p>

<p>"Then heaven save us! she is lost."</p>

<p>It was the mother who uttered this wail, as she convulsively
clasped her hands and walked distractedly to and fro.</p>

<p>The boys leaped out of the boats and gathered round the grief-smitten
couple.</p>

<p>"Tell us what this means," said Scout Master Hall, as he sympathetically
clasped the hand of the physician, who spoke with rare self-command,
though his wife began sobbing as if her heart was broken:</p>

<p>"We did not miss her until about an hour ago; I sat in front
of the house smoking and talking with wife, when she remarked
that it was time Ruth was in bed. I called to her, but there was
no answer. Thinking she had fallen asleep inside, I lighted a
match and looked around, wife joining me. A brief search showed
she was not there. We hurried outside, and I shouted again.</p>

<p>"By that time we were in an agony of distress and wife was sure
something dreadful had happened to her. As soon as we could command
our wits we found that neither of us had seen her for nearly two
hours and the thought struck us both that she had wandered off
to the bungalow. If she had kept along the beach and walked steadily
she would have had time to reach you, but there are so many other
awful chances that I dared not trust to that, so I appealed to
you."</p>

<p>"And you did right; there is nothing that is possible for us
to do that we will not do," was the response of Scout Master Hall.</p>

<p>"She may still be wandering along the beach on her way to the
bungalow."</p>

<p>"Five of our boys are hurrying over the same course to this point,
and will be sure to meet and bring her home."</p>

<p>"Unless she has strayed off in the woods and been lost."</p>

<p>"Let us hope that such is the fact, for then she will be safe
and suffer only slight inconveniences."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is worse than that," moaned the mother, still pacing
to and fro and wringing her hands; "she has fallen into the lake
and been drowned."</p>

<p>"I cannot believe that," said the Scout Master, following the
remark with such tactful assurances that the mother regained a
part of her self-command, to the extent even of feeling a faint
hope that all was well with her child.</p>

<p>The conduct of the youths was admirable. When they spoke it was
in whispers and undertones, but every heart was filled with the
sincerest pity, and all were eager to do everything they could
for the smitten parents.</p>

<p>The Boy Scout does not content himself with words: his mission
is to do a good turn, and where every minute was beyond value
none was thrown away.</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall assumed charge. He directed six of the boys
to take the back trail, as it might be called,—that is, around
the eastern end of the lake to the bungalow. This would insure
their meeting Hoke Butler and his companions, who in turn would
meet the missing child if she had wandered over the same route.
The six to whom this task was entrusted were under the charge
of Mike Murphy.</p>

<p>The same number of boys were ordered to follow the opposite direction,—that
is, to skirt the lake to the westward,—each of the two searching
parties to keep it up until they came together at the bungalow.
This arrangement left four Boy Scouts, including Mr. Hall and
not mentioning the father and mother. The leader proposed that
he, one of the lads and the parents should separate, plunge into
the woods and pursue the hunt independently of one another. Since
for a time the search must be a blind one this plan was as good
as any that could be suggested.</p>

<p>The Scout Master took Alvin and Chester aside.</p>

<p>"I have selected you for a special work," he said. "You are fleet
of foot, cool-headed and have good judgment. The doctor has made
no reference to those tramps, and yet I know he suspects they
have stolen Ruth, and intend to hold her for ransom. I believe
it is either that, or she has wandered off and fallen asleep in
the woods,—with the possibility that she is drowned.</p>

<p>"I want you to make your way as quickly as you can to the little
town of Bovil, where I think there is a telephone. If the tramps
have kidnapped the Sunbeam, they will try to get out of the neighborhood.
Telephone to the officers at Boothbay Harbor and other points,
and get word to Burton at Mouse Island as soon as possible, and
ask him to make all haste here with Zip. He’ll do it." </p>
