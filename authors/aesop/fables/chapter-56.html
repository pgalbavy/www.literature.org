A LION, fatigued by the heat of a summer's day, fell fast asleep
in his den.  A Mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from
his slumbers.  He rose up and shook himself in great wrath, and
searched every corner of his den to find the Mouse.  A Fox seeing
him said:  "A fine Lion you are, to be frightened of a Mouse."
"'Tis not the Mouse I fear," said the Lion; "I resent his
familiarity and ill-breeding."  
 
Little liberties are great offenses.
