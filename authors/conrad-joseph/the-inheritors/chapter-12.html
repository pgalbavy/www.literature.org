<p><em>ELEVEN</em></p>

<p>I couldn't get to sleep that night, but lay and tossed, lit my
candle and read, and so on, for ever and ever&mdash;for an eternity.
I was confoundedly excited; there were a hundred things to be
thought about; clamouring to be thought about; out-clamouring
the re-current chimes of some near clock. I began to read the
article by Radet in the <em>Revue Rouge</em>&mdash;the one I had bought
of the old woman in the kiosque. It upset me a good deal&mdash;that
article. It gave away the whole Greenland show so completely that
the ecstatic bosh I had just despatched to the <em>Hour</em> seemed
impossible. I suppose the good Radet had his axe to grind&mdash;just
as I had had to grind the State Founder's, but Radet's axe didn't
show. I was reading about an inland valley, a broad, shadowy,
grey thing; immensely broad, immensely shadowy, winding away between
immense, half-invisible mountains into the silence of an unknown
country. A little band of men, microscopic figures in that immensity,
in those mists, crept slowly up it. A man among them was speaking;
I seemed to hear his voice, low, monotonous, overpowered by the
wan light and the silence and the vastness.</p>

<p>And how well it was done&mdash;how the man could write; how skilfully
he made his points. There was no slosh about it, no sentiment.
The touch was light, in places even gay. He saw so well the romance
of that dun band that had cast remorse behind; that had no return,
no future, that spread desolation desolately. This was merely
a review article&mdash;a thing that in England would have been unreadable;
the narrative of a nomad of some genius. I could never have written
like that &mdash;I should have spoilt it somehow. It set me tingling
with desire, with the desire that transcends the sexual; the desire
for the fine phrase, for the right word&mdash;for all the other intangibles.
And I had been wasting all this time; had been writing my inanities.
I must go away; must get back, right back to the old road, must
work. There was so little time. It was unpleasant, too, to have
been mixed up in this affair, to have been trepanned into doing
my best to help it on its foul way. God knows I had little of
the humanitarian in me. If people must murder in the by-ways of
an immense world they must do murder and pay the price. But that
I should have been mixed up in such was not what I had wanted.
I must have done with it all; with all this sort of thing, must
get back to my old self, must get back. I seemed to hear the slow
words of the Duc de Mersch.</p>

<p>"We have increased exports by so much; the imports by so much.
We have protected the natives, have kept their higher interests
ever present in our minds. And through it all we have never forgotten
the mission entrusted to us by Europe&mdash;to remove the evil of darkness
from the earth&mdash;to root out barbarism with its nameless horrors,
whose existence has been a blot on our consciences. Men of good-will
and self-sacrifice are doing it now&mdash;are laying down their priceless
lives to root out ... to root our...."</p>

<p>Of course they <em>were</em> rooting them out.</p>

<p>It didn't matter to me. One supposes that that sort of native
exists for that sort of thing&mdash;to be rooted out by men of good-will,
with careers to make. The point was that that was what they were
really doing out there&mdash;rooting out the barbarians as well as
the barbarism, and proving themselves worthy of their hire. And
I had been writing them up and was no better than the farcical
governor of a department who would write on the morrow to protest
that that was what they did not do. You see I had a sort of personal
pride in those days; and preferred to think of myself as a decent
person. I knew that people would say the same sort of thing about
me that they said about all the rest of them. I couldn't very
well protest. I <em>had</em> been scratching the backs of all
sorts of creatures; out of friendship, out of love&mdash;for all sorts
of reasons. This was only a sort of last straw&mdash;or perhaps it
was the sight of her that had been the last straw. It seemed naïvely
futile to have been wasting my time over Mrs. Hartly and those
she stood for, when there was something so different in the world&mdash;something
so like a current of east wind.</p>

<p>That vein of thought kept me awake, and a worse came to keep
it company. The men from the next room came home&mdash;students, I
suppose. They talked gaily enough, their remarks interspersed
by the thuds of falling boots and the other incomprehensible noises
of the night. Through the flimsy partition I caught half sentences
in that sort of French intonation that is so impossible to attain.
It reminded me of the voices of the two men at the Opera. I began
to wonder what they had been saying&mdash;what they could have been
saying that concerned me and affected the little correspondent
to interfere. Suddenly the thing dawned upon me with the startling
clearness of a figure in a complicated pattern&mdash;a clearness from
which one cannot take one's eyes.</p>

<p>It threw everything&mdash;the whole world&mdash;into more unpleasant relations
with me than even the Greenland affair. They had not been talking
about my aunt and her Salon, but about my ... my sister. She was
De Mersch's "<em>Anglaise</em>." I did not believe it, but probably
all Paris&mdash;the whole world&mdash;said she was. And to the whole world
I was her brother! Those two men who had looked at me over their
shoulders had shrugged and said, "Oh, <em>he's</em> ..." And the
whole world wherever I went would whisper in asides, "Don't you
know Granger? He's the brother. De Mersch employs him."</p>

<p>I began to understand everything; the woman in de Mersch's room
with her "Eschingan-Grangeur-r-r"; the deference of the little
Jew&mdash;the man who knew. <em>He</em> knew that <em>I&mdash;</em>that
I, who patronised him, was a person to stand well with because
of my&mdash;my sister's hold over de Mersch. I wasn't, of course, but
you can't understand how the whole thing maddened me all the same.
I hated the world&mdash;this world of people who whispered and were
whispered to, of men who knew and men who wanted to know&mdash;the
shadowy world of people who didn't matter, but whose eyes and
voices were all round one and did somehow matter. I knew well
enough how it had come about. It was de Mersch&mdash;the State Founder,
with his shamed face and his pallid hands. She had been attracted
by his air of greatness, by his elective grand-dukedom, by his
protestations. Women are like that. She had been attracted and
didn't know what she was doing, didn't know what the world was
over here&mdash;how people talked. She had been excited by the whirl
and flutter of it, and perhaps she didn't care. The thing must
come to an end, however. She had said that I should go to her
on the morrow. Well, I would go, and I would put a stop to this.
I had suddenly discovered how very much I was a Granger of Etchingham,
after all I <em>had</em> family traditions and graves behind me.
And for the sake of all these people whose one achievement had
been the making of a good name I <em>had</em> to intervene now.
After all&mdash;"<em>Bon sang ne</em>" &mdash;does not get itself talked
about in <em>that</em> way.</p>

<p>The early afternoon of the morrow found me in a great room&mdash;a
faded, sombre salon of the house my aunt had taken in the Faubourg
Saint Germain. Numbers of strong-featured people were talking
in groups among the tables and chairs of a time before the Revolution.
I rather forget how I had got there, and what had gone before.
I must have arisen late and passed the intervening hours in a
state of trepidation. I was going to see her, and I was like a
cub in love, with a man's place to fill. It was a preposterous
state of things that set the solid world in a whirl. Once there,
my eyes suddenly took in things.</p>

<p>I had a sense of her standing by my side. She had just introduced
me to my aunt&mdash;a heavy-featured, tired-eyed village tyrant. She
was so obviously worn out, so obviously "not what she had been,"
that her face would have been pitiful but for its immovable expression
of class pride. The Grangers of Etchingham, you see, were so absolutely
at the top of their own particular kind of tree that it was impossible
for them to meet anyone who was not an inferior. A man might be
a cabinet minister, might even be a prince, but he couldn't be
a Granger of Etchingham, couldn't have such an assortment of graves,
each containing a Granger, behind his back. The expression didn't
even lift for me who had. It couldn't, it was fixed there. One
wondered what she was doing in this <em>galère</em>. It seemed
impossible that she should interest herself in the restoration
of the Bourbons&mdash;they were all very well, but they weren't even
English, let alone a county family. I figured it out that she
must have set her own village so much in order that there remained
nothing but the setting in order of the rest of the world. Her
bored eyes wandered sleepily over the assemblage. They seemed
to have no preferences for any of them. They rested on the vacuously
Bonaparte prince, on the moribund German Jesuit to whom he was
listening, on the darkly supple young Spanish priest, on the rosy-gilled
English Passionist, on Radet, the writer of that article in the
<em>Revue Rouge</em>, who was talking to a compatriot in one of
the tall windows. She seemed to accept the saturnine-looking men,
the political women, who all spoke a language not their own, with
an accent and a fluency, and a dangerous far-away smile and a
display of questionable teeth all their own. She seemed to class
the political with the pious, the obvious adventurer with the
seeming fanatic. It was amazing to me to see her there, standing
with her county family self-possession in the midst of so much
that was questionable. She offered me no explanation; I had to
find one for myself.</p>

<p>We stood and talked in the centre of the room. It did not seem
a place in which one <em>could</em> sit.</p>

<p>"Why have you never been to see me?" she asked languidly. "I
might never have known of your existence if it had not been for
your sister." My sister was standing at my side, you must remember.
I don't suppose that I started, but I made my aunt no answer.</p>

<p>"Indeed," she went on, "I should never have known that you had
a sister. Your father was so <em>very</em> peculiar. From the
day he married, my husband never heard a word from him."</p>

<p>"They were so very different," I said, listlessly.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she answered, "brothers so often are." She sighed,
apropos of nothing. She continued to utter disjointed sentences
from which I gathered a skeleton history of my <em>soi distant</em>
sister's introduction of herself and of her pretensions. She had,
it seemed, casually introduced herself at some garden-party or
function of the sort, had represented herself as a sister of my
own to whom a maternal uncle had left a fabulous fortune. She
herself had suggested her being sheltered under my aunt's roof
as a singularly welcome "paying guest." She herself, too, had
suggested the visit to Paris and had hired the house from a degenerate
Duc de Luynes who preferred the delights of an <em>appartement</em>
in the less lugubrious Avenue Marceau.</p>

<p>"We have tastes so much in common," my aunt explained, as she
moved away to welcome a new arrival. I was left alone with the
woman who called herself my sister.</p>

<p>We stood a little apart. Each little group of talkers in the
vast room seemed to stand just without earshot of the next. I
had my back to the door, my face to her.</p>

<p>"And so you have come," she said, maliciously it seemed to me.</p>

<p>It was impossible to speak in <em>such</em> a position; in such
a place; impossible to hold a discussion on family affairs when
a diminutive Irishwoman with too mobile eyebrows, and a couple
of gigantic, raw-boned, lugubrious Spaniards, were in a position
to hear anything that one uttered above a whisper. One might want
to raise one's voice. Besides, she was so&mdash;so terrible; there
was no knowing what she might not say. She so obviously did not
care what the Irish or the Spaniards or the Jesuits heard or thought,
that I was forced to the mortifying conclusion that I did.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've come," I answered. I felt as outrageously out of it
as one does at a suburban hop where one does not know one animal
of the menagerie. I did not know what to do or what to say, or
what to do with my hands. I was pervaded by the unpleasant idea
that all those furtive eyes were upon me; gauging me because I
was the brother of a personality. I was concerned about the fit
of my coat and my boots, and all the while I was in a furious
temper; my errand was important.</p>

<p>She stood looking at me, a sinuous, brilliant thing, with a light
in the eyes half challenging, half openly victorious.</p>

<p>"You have come," she said, "and ..."</p>

<p>I became singularly afraid of her; and wanted to stop her mouth.
She might be going to say anything. She overpowered me so that
I actually dwindled&mdash;into the gawkiness of extreme youth. I became
a goggle-eyed, splay-footed boy again and made a boy's desperate
effort after a recovery at one stroke of an ideal standard of
dignity.</p>

<p>"I must have a word with you," I said, remembering. She made
a little gesture with her hands, signifying "I am here." "But
in private," I added.</p>

<p>"Oh, everything's in private here," she said. I was silent.</p>

<p>"I must," I added after a time.</p>

<p>"I can't retire with you," she said; "'it would look odd,' you'd
say, wouldn't you?" I shrugged my shoulders in intense irritation.
I didn't want to be burlesqued. A flood of fresh people came into
the room. I heard a throaty "ahem" behind me. The Duc de Mersch
was introducing himself to notice. It was as I had thought&mdash;the
man was an habitue, with his well-cut clothes, his air of protestation,
and his tremendous golden poll. He was the only sunlight that
the gloomy place rejoiced in. He bowed low over my oppressor's
hand, smiled upon me, and began to utter platitudes in English.</p>

<p>"Oh, you may speak French," she said carelessly.</p>

<p>"But your brother...." he answered.</p>

<p>"I understand French very well," I said. I was in no mood to
spare him embarrassments; wanted to show him that I had a hold
over him, and knew he wasn't the proper person to talk to a young
lady. He glared at me haughtily.</p>

<p>"But yesterday ..." he began in a tone that burlesqued august
displeasure. I was wondering what he had looked like on the other
side of the door&mdash;whilst that lady had been explaining his nature
to me.</p>

<p>"Yesterday I wished to avoid embarrassments," I said; "I was
to represent your views about Greenland. I might have misunderstood
you in some important matter."</p>

<p>"I see, I see," he said conciliatorily. "Yesterday we spoke English
for the benefit of the British public. When we speak French we
are not in public, I hope." He had a semi-supplicating manner.</p>

<p>"Everything's rather too much in public here," I answered. My
part as I imagined it was that of a British brother defending
his sister from questionable attentions&mdash;the person who "tries
to show the man he isn't wanted." But de Mersch didn't see the
matter in that light at all. He could not, of course. He was as
much used to being purred to as my aunt to looking down on non-county
persons. He seemed to think I was making an incomprehensible insular
joke, and laughed non-committally. It wouldn't have been possible
to let him know he wasn't wanted.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't be afraid of my brother," she said suddenly.
"He is quite harmless. He is even going to give up writing for
the papers except when we want him."</p>

<p>The Duc turned from me to her, smiled and bowed. His smile was
inane, but he bowed very well; he had been groomed into that sort
of thing or had it in the blood.</p>

<p>"We work together still?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she answered.</p>

<p>A hubbub of angry voices raised itself behind my back. It was
one of the <em>contretemps</em> that made the Salon Grangeur famous
throughout the city.</p>

<p>"You forced yourself upon me. Did I say anywhere that you were
responsible? If it resembles your particular hell upon earth,
what is that to me? You do worse things; you, yourself, monsieur.
Haven't I seen ... haven't I seen it?"</p>

<p>The Duc de Mersch looked swiftly over his shoulder toward the
window.</p>

<p>"They seem to be angry there," he said nervously. "Had not something
better be done, Miss Granger?"</p>

<p>Miss Granger followed the direction of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "we're used to these differences of opinion.
Besides, it's only Monsieur Radet; he's forever at war with someone
or other."</p>

<p>"He ought to be shown the door," the Duc grumbled.</p>

<p>"Oh, as for that," she answered, "we couldn't. My aunt would
be desolated by such a necessity. He is very influential in certain
quarters. My aunt wants to catch him for the &mdash;He's going
to write an article."</p>

<p>"He writes too many articles," the Duc said, with heavy displeasure.</p>

<p>"Oh, he has written <em>one</em> too many," she answered, "but
that can be traversed...."</p>

<p>"But no one believes," the Duc objected ... Radet's voice intermittently
broke in upon his <em>sotto-voce,</em> coming to our ears in gusts.</p>

<p>"Haven't I seen you ... and then ... and you offer me the cross
... to bribe me to silence ... me...."</p>

<p>In the general turning of faces toward the window in which stood
Radet and the other, mine turned too. Radet was a cadaverous,
weatherworn, passion-worn individual, badger-grey, and worked
up into a grotesquely attitudinised fury of injured self-esteem.
The other was a denationalised, shifty-eyed, sallow, grey-bearded
governor of one of the provinces of the Système Groënlandais;
had a closely barbered head, a bull neck, and a great belly. He
cast furtive glances round him, uncertain whether to escape or
to wait for his say. He looked at the ring that encircled the
window at a little distance, and his face, which had betrayed
a half-apparent shame, hardened at sight of the cynical masks
of the cosmopolitan conspirators. They were amused by the scene.
The Holsteiner gained confidence, shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You have had the fever very badly since you came back," he said,
showing a level row of white teeth. "You did not talk like that
out there."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;<em>pas si bête</em>&mdash;you would have hanged me, perhaps,
as you did that poor devil of a Swiss. What was his name? Now
you offer me the cross. Because I had the fever, <em>hein</em>?"</p>

<p>I had been watching the Duc's face; a first red flush had come
creeping from under the roots of his beard, and had spread over
the low forehead and the sides of the neck. The eye-glass fell
from the eye, a signal for the colour to retreat. The full lips
grew pallid, and began to mutter unspoken words. His eyes wandered
appealingly from the woman beside him to me. <em>I</em> didn't
want to look him in the face. The man was a trafficker in human
blood, an evil liver, and I hated him. He had to pay his price;
would have to pay&mdash;but I didn't want to see him pay it. There
was a limit.</p>

<p>I began to excuse myself, and slid out between the groups of
excellent plotters. As I was going, she said to me:</p>

<p>"You may come to me to-morrow in the morning."</p>
