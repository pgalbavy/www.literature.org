<p>The little party of fugitives occupied the position on the margin
of the grain-field for an hour or so longer, discussing the past
and arranging their plans for the immediate future. As they had
the time, the Mohawk took pains to explain some of his movements
made on the other side of the river, and also when they were engaged
in stealing across, which movements none of the party understood
at the time. It was necessary at this stage of the proceedings
for all to comprehend as fully as possible the plans that were
now to be followed in the game, where the stakes were life itself.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo assured them that with the coming of daylight the
Iroquois would use every exertion to capture them, as it had also
become a matter of pride on their part to outwit the Mohawk, with
whom they were really making the fight. Some of them would hunt
and follow the trail of the party, and every approach to the Wilkesbarre
fortifications would be guarded by their best warriors. Such being
the case, Ned and Jo were more convinced than ever that their
plan of giving up this method was wise, but they said nothing,
for they knew it was useless.</p>

<p>While they were talking the growing light in the eastern horizon
apprised them that day was near, and that it was unsafe to wait
longer. All instantly rose to their feet, looking upon the face
of the warrior for direction as to what they were to do. Before
he could speak, the sound of a rifle was heard, causing a start
of alarm on the part of his companions. The latter noticed that
the direction of the report was from the river, and, as it seemed,
from the very spot where they had left it.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of that?" asked Ned. "Can it have&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bang! bang! bang! came several other reports in quick succession,
showing that something serious was going on. Every voice was hushed,
and they looked in each other's faces, and then stared at the
Mohawk as if they would read the explanation in his painted countenance.
At the first glance there was nothing that could give them a clue
on those bronzed features, as seen in the early light of the morning.
The Indian was also listening and waiting till he could hear and
learn more before saying anything. The firing lasted until it
sounded as if a skirmish was going on close at hand. Could it
be that a party of fugitive patriots was engaged in a fight with
a lot of Tories and Indians?</p>

<p>When the firing had continued in a desultory way for several
minutes, the whites caught the sound of whoops, showing that the
redmen had a part in the trouble. The instant these cries fell
on the ears of the Mohawk, his dark face lit up with a gleam of
satisfaction, the expression of delight being noticed by all.</p>

<p>"What is it, Lena-Wingo?" asked Rosa. "Are they Iroquois and
white folks that are fighting?"</p>

<p>"No, not that."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Iroquois fighting Iroquois."</p>

<p>So his wish was granted, after all. The warriors had fallen into
battle among themselves, with a sure benefit to the fugitives.
Hence it was natural that the Mohawk, after being disappointed
twice on the preceding night, should listen to the sounds of the
strife with genuine pleasure. It looked as if with the coming
of daylight the Iroquois had discovered that some of their number
had blundered in the hunt for the Mohawk in a way that could not
be forgiven. A deadly quarrel was the result, with the certainty
that more than one of their bravest warriors would bite the dust
before it could be terminated, even by the chiefs and leaders
themselves. The fight lasted but a short time, for it was a fierce
fire, which must exhaust itself speedily for want of fuel.</p>

<p>The Mohawk, however, heard enough to convince him that execution
had been done, and his rejoicing was not interfered with through
any fear that it had been quieted down as were the other two impending
disturbances. But the morning was advancing, and the hours were
as precious to the fugitives as to the Iroquois. The probabilities
were that the revengeful enemies would soon be on their track,
and the whites had but to remain where they were a short time
longer to fall into their hands.</p>

<p>At the moment the noise of the conflict between the Indians ceased,
Lena-Wingo, who had maintained the standing position from the
first, moved off in a southerly course, looking around as a signal
for his companions to follow him. They were heading toward the
range of mountains which bounded the Wyoming valley on the southeast,
and which loomed up dark and frowning in the gray mist of the
early morning.</p>

<p>This route led them over cultivated ground and through woods,
where it seemed to the whites they might halt and find all the
shelter they could need. But the Mohawk pressed straight on, his
destination being the mountains themselves. The guide of the party
kept away from the cultivated portions of the valley as much as
possible, for it was dangerous to approach any body of men, or
the places where they were likely to be found. Lena-Wingo was
in his own territory, and it was his intention to manage the business
without asking for or accepting any suggestions from his friends.</p>

<p>The company had advanced something like a half mile when the
morning was fairly upon them&mdash;another of those clear, mild summer
days common to this latitude at that season of the year. They
were approaching rising ground, and soon began ascending to a
higher level than that which they had been treading for some time.
The Indian still stuck to the forest, for he felt a confidence
in its shadows such as the open country could not afford.</p>

<p>While progressing in this manner it was noticed by the youths
that he led them over as rough and stony paths as possible, and
that at the same time he stepped as carefully as he knew how&mdash;no
doubt with the purpose of hiding their tracks from the too curious
Iroquois.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo evinced no objections to his companions talking together
as they picked their way along, provided they kept their voices
below "concert pitch"&mdash;a precaution which they were sure to remember,
in view of what they had passed through so recently. For all that,
the Mohawk advanced with a confidence which at times resembled
recklessness, and Ned Clinton more than once was on the point
of remonstrating with him. But he held his peace, through fear
of offending him. The journey was continued in this fashion, the
party walking quite rapidly until they were well into the rising
ground of the mountains, when a halt was made.</p>

<p>It was a good omen that the whites had been able to go thus far
without encountering any of the Iroquois, and they were not a
little cheered thereby. But the fact remained&mdash;and it took somewhat
from their rejoicing&mdash;that they were further from Wilkesbarre
at the time of halting than they were at starting. It was because
they had gone away from instead of toward their destination that
accounted for their immunity from disturbance. Still, it is the
longest way home which is often the surest, and the Mohawk, in
conducting his companions in that direction, was only carrying
out a plan which he had formed while on the other side of the
Susquehanna, and of which this was but the preliminary step.</p>
