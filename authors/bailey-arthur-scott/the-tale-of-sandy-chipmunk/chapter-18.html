<p>Sandy Chipmunk liked milk. He never knew it, though, until he chanced to
come upon a saucerful which some one had set out on the big flat stone
that served as the back doorstep of the farmhouse.
</p>
<p>Sandy crept up and sniffed at the white liquid in the saucer. It smelled
very good. So he tasted it. And it tasted so much better, even, than it
smelled that he drank every drop of it.
</p><p>Sandy was sitting on the big stone step, washing his face, when Farmer
Green's cat leaped out of the doorway.
</p><p>The cat was very angry. And it was no wonder, because Sandy Chipmunk had
drunk her breakfast. She seemed to think that since Sandy had made away
with her breakfast it would be only fair if she should make away with
<u>him</u>.
</p><p>[Illustration: Farmer Green's Cat Leaped Out of the Doorway]
</p><p>But Sandy did not agree with her at all. Though he had washed only one
side of his face, he jumped sideways off the step and ran and hid in the
woodpile close by.
</p><p>You might think he would have had to stay there a long time. For the old
cat crouched down and watched the hole into which Sandy had crawled. She
seemed to have made up her mind to wait there until Sandy came out of
that hole again.
</p><p>If she had waited for that to happen she would have been there yet. For
Sandy crept through the woodpile, stole out the other side of it, and ran
home.
</p><p>He was glad to get away from the cat. But he was sorry there wasn't more
of that delicious drink which he had found in the saucer.
</p><p>Later that day Sandy told Fatty Coon what had happened.
</p><p>"I know what that was," Fatty Coon exclaimed. "It was milk."
</p><p>"I wonder where Farmer Green gets it," Sandy said.
</p><p>"From the cows, of course!" Fatty replied.
</p><p>"You don't say so!" Sandy Chipmunk cried. "I'm glad to know it." And he
scampered off across the pasture, toward three of Farmer Green's cows
which were chewing their cuds under the shade of a big maple tree.
</p><p>When Sandy asked them if they would please give him some milk to drink
two of the cows (they were the good-natured ones) only smiled at each
other. But the third cow (a surly old creature with long, sharp horns)
told him not to be silly.
</p><p>Well, Sandy Chipmunk saw that he could get no milk there. And he was
feeling quite downcast when he chanced to meet Henry Skunk, to whom he
told his troubles.
</p><p>"Of course the cows couldn't give you any milk!" Henry Skunk said. "It's
not milking time yet. So what could they do? You go down to the barnyard
late this afternoon and you'll find all the milk you could drink in a
thousand years."
</p><p>Sandy Chipmunk thanked him. And somehow he managed to wait until the
afternoon was almost gone. Then he skipped down the hill to Farmer
Green's barn. He thought it must be milking time, because Johnnie Green
and old dog Spot had driven all the cows home.
