<p>George departed, and Bibbs was left gazing upon chaos and listening
to thunder. He could not reach the stairway without passing the
open doors of the library, and he was convinced that the mere
glimpse of him, just then, would prove nothing less than insufferable
for his father. For that reason he was about to make his escape
into the gold-and-brocade room, intending to keep out of sight,
when he heard Sheridan vociferously demanding his presence.</p>

<p>"Tell him to come in here! He's out there. I heard George just
let him in. Now you'll <em>SEE!" </em>And tear-stained Mrs. Sheridan,
looking out into the hall, beckoned to her son.</p>

<p>Bibbs went as far as the doorway. Gurney sat winding a strip
of white cotton, his black bag open upon a chair near by; and
Sheridan was striding up and down, his hand so heavily wrapped
in fresh bandages that he seemed to be wearing a small boxing-glove.
His eyes were bloodshot; his forehead was heavily bedewed; one
side of his collar had broken loose, and there were blood-stains
upon his right cuff.</p>

<p>"<em>THERE'S </em>our little sunshine!" he cried, as Bibbs appeared.
"<em>THERE'S </em>the hope o' the family&mdash;my lifelong pride and
joy! I want&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep you hand in that sling," said Gurney, sharply.</p>

<p>Sheridan turned upon him, uttering a sound like a howl. "For
God's sake, sing another tune!" he cried. "You said you 'came
as a doctor but stay as a friend,' and in that capacity you undertake
to sit up and criticize ME&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, talk sense," said the doctor, and yawned intentionally.
"What do you want Bibbs to say?"</p>

<p>"You were sittin' up there tellin' me I got 'hysterical'&mdash;'hysterical,'
oh Lord! You sat up there and told me I got 'hysterical' over
nothin'! You sat up there tellin' me I didn't have as heavy burdens
as many another man you knew. I just want you to hear <em>THIS.
</em>Now listen!" He swung toward the quiet figure waiting in
the doorway. "Bibbs, will you come down-town with me Monday morning
and let me start you with two vice-presidencies, a directorship,
stock, and salaries? I ask you."</p>

<p>"No, father," said Bibbs, gently.</p>

<p>Sheridan looked at Gurney and then faced his son once more.</p>

<p>"Bibbs, you want to stay in the shop, do you, at nine dollars
a week, instead of takin' up my offer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And I'd like the doctor to hear: What'll you do if I decide
you're too high-priced a workin'-man either to live in my house
or work in my shop?"</p>

<p>"Find other work," said Bibbs.</p>

<p>"There! You hear him for yourself!" Sheridan cried. "You hear
what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep you hand in that sling! Yes, I hear him."</p>

<p>Sheridan leaned over Gurney and shouted, in a voice that cracked
and broke, piping into falsetto: "He thinks of bein' a <em>PLUMBER!
</em>He wants to be a <em>PLUMBER! </em>He told me he couldn't
<em>THINK </em>if he went into business&mdash;he wants to be a plumber
so he can <em>THINK</em>!"</p>

<p>He fell back a step, wiping his forhead with the back of his
left hand. "There! That's my son! That's the only son I got now!
That's my chance to live," he cried, with a bitterness that seemed
to leave ashes in his throat. "That's my one chance to live&mdash;that
thing you see in the doorway yonder!"</p>

<p>Dr. Gurney thoughtfully regarded the bandage strip he had been
winding, and tossed it into the open bag. "What's the matter with
giving Bibbs a chance to live?" he said, coolly. "I would if I
were you. You've had <em>TWO </em>that went into business."</p>

<p>Sheridan's mouth moved grotesquely before he could speak. "Joe
Gurney,"  he said, when he could command himself so far, "are
you accusin' me of the responsibility for the death of my son
James?"</p>

<p>"I accuse you of nothing," said the doctor. "But just once I'd
like to have it out with you on the question of Bibbs&mdash;and while
he's here, too." He got up, walked to the fire, and stood warming
his hands behind his back and smiling. "Look here, old fellow,
let's be reasonable," he said. "You were bound Bibbs should go
to the shop again, and I gave you and him, both, to understand
pretty plainly that if he went it was at the risk of his life.
Well, what did he do? He said he wanted to go. And he did go,
and he's made good there. Now, see: Isn't that enough? Can't you
let him off now? He wants to write, and how do you know that he
couldn't do it if you gave him a chance? How do you know he hasn't
some message&mdash;something to say that might make the world just
a little bit happier or wiser? He <em>MIGHT&mdash;</em>in time&mdash;it's
a possibility not to be denied. Now he can't deliver any message
if he goes down there with you, and he won't <em>HAVE </em>any
to deliver. I don't say going down with you is likely to injure
his health, as I thought the shop would, and as the shop did,
the first time. I'm not speaking as doctor now, anyhow. But I
tell you one thing I know: if you take him down there you'll kill
something that I feel is in him, and it's finer, I think, than
his physical body, and you'll kill it deader than a door-nail!
And so why not let it live? You've about come to the end of your
string, old fellow. Why not stop this perpetual devilish fighting
and give Bibbs his chance?"</p>

<p>Sheridan stood looking at him fixedly. "What 'fighting?'"</p>

<p>"Yours&mdash;with nature." Gurney sustained the daunting gaze of his
fierce antagonist equably. "You don't seem to understand that
you've been struggling against actual law."</p>

<p>"What law?"</p>

<p>"Natural law," said Gurney. "What do you think beat you with
Edith? Did Edith, herself, beat you? Didn't she obey without question
something powerful that was against you? <em>EDITH </em>wasn't
against you, and you weren't against <em>HER, </em>but you set
yourself against the power that had her in its grip, and it shot
out a spurt of flame&mdash;and won in a walk! What's taken Roscoe from
you? Timbers bear just so much strain, old man; but <em>YOU </em>wanted
to send the load across the broken bridge, and you thought you
could bully or coax the cracked thing into standing. Well, you
couldn't! Now here's Bibbs. There are thousands of men fit for
the life you want him to lead&mdash;and so is he. It wouldn't take
half of Bibbs's brains to be twice as good a business man as Jim
and Roscoe put together."</p>

<p>"<em>WHAT!" </em>Sheridan goggled at him like a zany.</p>

<p>"Your son Bibbs," said the doctor, composedly, "Bibbs Sheridan
has the kind and quantity of 'gray matter' that will make him
a success in anything&mdash;if he ever wakes up! Personally I should
prefer him to remain asleep. I like him that way. But the thousands
of men fit for the life you want him to lead aren't fit to do
much with the life he <em>OUGHT </em>to lead. Blindly, he's been
fighting for the chance to lead it&mdash;he's obeying something that
begs to stay alive within him; and, blindly, he knows you'll crush
it out. You've set your will to do it. Let me tell you something
more. You don't know what you've become since Jim's going thwarted
you&mdash;and that's what was uppermost, a bafflement stronger than
your normal grief. You're half mad with a consuming fury against
the very self of the law&mdash;for it was the very self of the law
that took Jim from you. That was a law concerning the cohesion
of molecules. The very self of the law took Roscoe from you and
gave Edith the certainty of beating you; and the very self of
the law makes Bibbs deny you to-night. The <em>LAW </em>beats
you. Haven't you been whipped enough? But you want to whip the
law&mdash;you've set yourself against it, to bend it to your own ends,
to wield it and twist it&mdash;"</p>

<p>The voice broke from Sheridan's heaving chest in a shout. "Yes!
And by God, I will!"</p>

<p>"So Ajax defied the lightning," said Gurney.</p>

<p>"I've heard that dam'-fool story, too," Sheridan retorted, fiercely.
"That's for chuldern and niggers. It ain't twentieth century,
let me tell you! 'Defied the lightning,' did he, the jackass!
If he'd been half a man he'd 'a' got away with it. WE don't go
showin' off defyin' the lightning&mdash;we hitch it up and make it
work for us like a black-steer! A man nowadays would just as soon
think o' defyin' a wood-shed!"</p>

<p>"Well, what about Bibbs?" said Gurney. "Will you be a really
big man now and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gurney, you know a lot about bigness!" Sheridan began to walk
to and fro again, and the doctor returned gloomily to his chair.
He had shot his bolt the moment he judged its chance to strike
center was best, but the target seemed unaware of the marksman.</p>

<p>"I'm tryin' to make a big man out o' that poor truck yonder,"
Sheridan went on, "and you step in, beggin' me to let him be Lord
knows what &mdash;I don't! I suppose you figure it out that now
I got a <em>SON-IN-LAW, I </em>mightn't need a son! Yes, I got
a son-in-law now&mdash;a spender!"</p>

<p>"Oh, put your hand back!" said Gurney, wearily.</p>

<p>There was a bronze inkstand upon the table. Sheridan put his
right hand in the sling, but with his left he swept the inkstand
from the table and half-way across the room&mdash;a comet with a destroying
black tail. Mrs. Sheridan shrieked and sprang toward it.</p>

<p>"Let it lay!" he shouted, fiercely. "Let it lay!" And, weeping,
she obeyed. "Yes, sir," he went on, in a voice the more ominous
for the sudden hush he put upon it. "I got a spender for a son-in-law!
It's wonderful where property goes, sometimes. There was ole man
Tracy&mdash;you remember him, Doc &mdash;J. R. Tracy, solid banker.
He went into the bank as messenger, seventeen years old; he was
president at forty-three, and he built that bank with his life
for forty years more. He was down there from nine in the morning
until four in the afternoon the day before he died&mdash;over eighty!
Gilt edge, that bank? It was diamond edge! He used to eat a bag
o' peanuts and an apple for lunch; but he wasn't stingy&mdash;he was
just livin' in his business. He didn't care for pie or automobiles&mdash;he
had his bank. It was an institution, and it come pretty near bein'
the beatin' heart o' this town in its time. Well, that ole man
used to pass one o' these here turned-up-nose and turned-up-pants
cigarette boys on the streets. Never spoke to him, Tracy didn't.
Speak to him? God! he wouldn't 'a' coughed on him! He wouldn't
'a' let him clean the cuspidors at the bank! Why, if he'd 'a'
just seen him standin' in <em>FRONT </em>the bank he'd 'a' had
him run off the street. And yet all Tracy was doin' every day
of his life was workin' for that cigarette boy! Tracy thought
it was for the bank; he thought he was givin' his life and his
life-blood and the blood of his brain for the bank, but he wasn't.
It was every bit&mdash;from the time he went in at seventeen till he
died in harness at eighty-three&mdash;it was every last lick of it
just slavin' for that turned-up-nose, turned-up-pants cigarette
boy. <em>AND TRACY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME! </em>He died, not
ever havin' heard it, though he chased him off the front steps
of his house once. The day after Tracy died his old-maid daughter
married the cigarette&mdash;and there <em>AIN'T </em>any Tracy bank
any more! And now"&mdash;his voice rose again&mdash;"and now I got a cigarette
son-in-law!"</p>

<p>Gurney pointed to the flourishing right hand without speaking,
and Sheridan once more returned it to the sling.</p>

<p>"My son-in-law likes Florida this winter," Sheridan went on.
"That's good, and my son-in-law better enjoy it, because I don't
think he'll be there next winter. They got twelve-thousand dollars
to spend, and I hear it can be done in Florida by rich sons-in-law.
When Roscoe's woman got me to spend that much on a porch for their
new house, Edith wouldn't give me a minute's rest till I turned
over the same to her. And she's got it, besides what I gave her
to go East on. It'll be gone long before this time next year,
and when she comes home and leaves the cigarette behind&mdash;for good&mdash;she'll
get some more. MY name ain't Tracy, and there ain't goin' to be
any Tracy business in the Sheridan family. And there ain't goin'
to be any college foundin' and endowin' and trusteein', nor God-knows-what
to keep my property alive when I'm gone! Edith'll be back, and
she'll get a girl's share when she's through with that cigarette,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the way," interposed Gurney, "didn't Mrs. Sheridan tell me
that Bibbs warned you Edith would marry Lamhorn in New York?"</p>

<p>Sheridan went completely to pieces: he swore, while his wife
screamed and stopped her ears. And as he swore he pounded the
table with his wounded hand, and when the doctor, after storming
at him ineffectively, sprang to catch and protect that hand, Sheridan
wrenched it away, tearing the bandage. He hammered the table till
it leaped.</p>

<p>"Fool!" he panted, choking. "If he's shown gumption enough to
guess right the first time in his life, it's enough for me to
begin learnin' him on!" And, struggling with the doctor, he leaned
toward Bibbs, thrusting forward his convulsed face, which was
deathly pale. "My name ain't Tracy, I tell you!" he screamed,
hoarsely. "You give in, you stubborn fool! I've had my way with
you before, and I'll have my way with you now!"</p>

<p>Bibbs's face was as white as his father's, but he kept remembering
that "splendid look" of Mary's which he had told her would give
him courage in a struggle, so that he would "never give up."</p>

<p>"No. You can't have your way," he said. And then, obeying a significant
motion of Gurney's head, he went out quickly, leaving them struggling.</p>
