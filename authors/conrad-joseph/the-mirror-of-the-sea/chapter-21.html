<p> That is why your "strandings" are for the most part so unexpected. 
In fact, they are all unexpected, except those heralded by some
short glimpse of the danger, full of agitation and excitement,
like an awakening from a dream of incredible folly.</p>

<p>The land suddenly at night looms up right over your bows, or
perhaps the cry of "Broken water ahead!" is raised, and some long
mistake, some complicated edifice of self-delusion, over-confidence,
and wrong reasoning is brought down in a fatal shock, and the
heart-searing experience of your ship’s keel scraping and scrunching
over, say, a coral reef.  It is a sound, for its size, far more
terrific to your soul than that of a world coming violently to
an end.  But out of that chaos your belief in your own prudence
and sagacity reasserts itself.  You ask yourself, Where on earth
did I get to?  How on earth did I get there? with a conviction
that it could not be your own act, that there has been at work
some mysterious conspiracy of accident; that the charts are all
wrong, and if the charts are not wrong, that land and sea have
changed their places; that your misfortune shall for ever remain
inexplicable, since you have lived always with the sense of your
trust, the last thing on closing your eyes, the first on opening
them, as if your mind had kept firm hold of your responsibility
during the hours of sleep.</p>

<p>You contemplate mentally your mischance, till little by little
your mood changes, cold doubt steals into the very marrow of your
bones, you see the inexplicable fact in another light.  That is
the time when you ask yourself, How on earth could I have been
fool enough to get there?  And you are ready to renounce all belief
in your good sense, in your knowledge, in your fidelity, in what
you thought till then was the best in you, giving you the daily
bread of life and the moral support of other men’s confidence.</p>

<p>The ship is lost or not lost.  Once stranded, you have to do
your best by her.  She may be saved by your efforts, by your resource
and fortitude bearing up against the heavy weight of guilt and
failure.  And there are justifiable strandings in fogs, on uncharted
seas, on dangerous shores, through treacherous tides.  But, saved
or not saved, there remains with her commander a distinct sense
of loss, a flavour in the mouth of the real, abiding danger that
lurks in all the forms of human existence.  It is an acquisition,
too, that feeling.  A man may be the better for it, but he will
not be the same.  Damocles has seen the sword suspended by a hair
over his head, and though a good man need not be made less valuable
by such a knowledge, the feast shall not henceforth have the same
flavour.</p>

<p>Years ago I was concerned as chief mate in a case of stranding
which was not fatal to the ship.  We went to work for ten hours
on end, laying out anchors in readiness to heave off at high water. 
While I was still busy about the decks forward I heard the steward
at my elbow saying: "The captain asks whether you mean to come
in, sir, and have something to eat to-day."</p>

<p>I went into the cuddy.  My captain sat at the head of the table
like a statue.  There was a strange motionlessness of everything
in that pretty little cabin.  The swing-table which for seventy
odd days had been always on the move, if ever so little, hung
quite still above the soup-tureen. Nothing could have altered
the rich colour of my commander’s complexion, laid on generously
by wind and sea; but between the two tufts of fair hair above
his ears, his skull, generally suffused with the hue of blood,
shone dead white, like a dome of ivory.  And he looked strangely
untidy. I perceived he had not shaved himself that day; and yet
the wildest motion of the ship in the most stormy latitudes we
had passed through, never made him miss one single morning ever
since we left the Channel. The fact must be that a commander cannot
possibly shave himself when his ship is aground.  I have commanded
ships myself, but I don’t know; I have never tried to shave in
my life.</p>

<p>He did not offer to help me or himself till I had coughed markedly
several times.  I talked to him professionally in a cheery tone,
and ended with the confident assertion:</p>

<p>"We shall get her off before midnight, sir."</p>

<p>He smiled faintly without looking up, and muttered as if to himself:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; the captain put the ship ashore and we got her off."</p>

<p>Then, raising his head, he attacked grumpily the steward, a lanky,
anxious youth with a long, pale face and two big front teeth.</p>

<p>"What makes this soup so bitter?  I am surprised the mate can
swallow the beastly stuff.  I’m sure the cook’s ladled some salt
water into it by mistake."</p>

<p>The charge was so outrageous that the steward for all answer
only dropped his eyelids bashfully.</p>

<p>There was nothing the matter with the soup.  I had a second helping. 
My heart was warm with hours of hard work at the head of a willing
crew.  I was elated with having handled heavy anchors, cables,
boats without the slightest hitch; pleased with having laid out
scientifically bower, stream, and kedge exactly where I believed
they would do most good.  On that occasion the bitter taste of
a stranding was not for my mouth.  That experience came later,
and it was only then that I understood the loneliness of the man
in charge.</p>

<p>It’s the captain who puts the ship ashore; it’s we who get her
off.</p>
