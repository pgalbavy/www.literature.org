<p>Jennie Whitney saw something else, which almost made her heart
stop beating.</p>

<p>To the southward, whence Budd Hankinson had ridden, several horsemen
were in sight, coming from the direction of the cattle-ranges.
They were approaching at a walk, something they would not do unless
serious cause existed.</p>

<p>The messenger had been sent ahead to break the news to the sad
and anxious hearts.</p>

<p>"Budd," she said, "you have not told us about father."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, my dear," interposed her mother, as if to shut out
all evil tidings; "nothing has happened to him."</p>

<p>"Wal, I'm sorry to say that he has been hurt worse than Fred,"
was the alarming response, accompanied by a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"How bad? How much worse? Tell us, tell us," insisted the wife.</p>

<p>"Thar's no use of denyin' that he got it bad; fact is he couldn't
have been hit harder."</p>

<p>The distressed fellow was so worked up that he turned his head
and looked over his shoulder, as if to avoid those yearning eyes
fixed upon him. That aimless glance revealed the approaching horsemen
and nerved him with new courage.</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Whitney and Jennie, you must be brave. Bear it as
he would bear the news about you and Fred if he was&mdash;alive!"</p>

<p>A shriek accompanied the words of the cowman, and Jennie caught
her mother in time to save her from falling. Her own heart was
breaking, but she did her utmost, poor thing, to cheer the one
to whom the sunlight of happiness could never come again.</p>

<p>"There, mother, try to bear it. We have Fred left to us, and
I am with you. God will not desert us."</p>

<p>Hugh Whitney had never spoken after that first interchange of
volleys with the rustlers. He died bravely at the post of duty
and was tenderly borne homeward, where he was given a decent burial,
his grave bedewed not only by the tears of the stricken widow
and children, but by those of the stern, hardy cowmen to whom
he had been an employer as kind and indulgent as he was brave.</p>

<p>A few paragraphs are necessary to explain the incidents that
follow.</p>

<p>Wherever cattlemen have organized outfits and located ranches
cattle-thieves have followed, and fierce fighting has resulted.
These men are known as "rustlers." The late troubles caused cattle
and horse-thieves to unite against the legitimate owners, and
the name now includes both classes of evil-doers. The troubles
in Wyoming were the results of the efforts of the Wyoming State
Live Stock Association to put a check upon rustlers who are tempted
to steal by the vast profits afforded.</p>

<p>At the time the Association was formed the rustlers were few
in number, and confined their acts to branding the mavericks or
unbranded yearlings with their own brands. They did not act in
concert, and since the laws of the State require every brand to
be registered, in order to establish ownership, the rustlers had
as much right to their own brands as the legitimate cowmen. As
long as the mavericks were not openly branded there was no means
of stopping them.</p>

<p>It happens quite often that the round-up fails to gather in all
the cattle. The mavericks are allowed to go to the outfit with
whose cattle they have run, and that outfit puts its own brand
on them.</p>

<p>The rustlers grew more daring as their numbers increased, and,
instead of confining their operations to the mavericks, began
altering brands. Not only that, but they were often bold enough
to leave the old brand and burn a new one and forge a bill of
sale.</p>

<p>The rustlers were generally the owners of small ranches, or cowboys
who had a few head of cattle on the range or running with some
rancher's stock. The Association made a rule that no cow outfit
should employ a cowman that had been guilty of branding a maverick,
or of helping the rustlers, or of working with or for them. A
blacklist was kept of such cowmen, with the result that a good
many were unable to get employment from the Association outfits
and were compelled to become rustlers themselves.</p>

<p>The association of rustlers became desperate because of the serious
check given them by the Live Stock Association, which placed its
inspectors at all the cattle-markets, Omaha, Chicago, St. Louis,
Kansas City and St. Paul. Every shipment of cattle was closely
inspected, and if it came from a rustler he was obliged to prove
his title to each steer, or they were confiscated and the proceeds
sent to the owner of the brand. Sometimes a legal proof of ownership
would not be accepted, for the owners were determined to stamp
out the rustling business.</p>

<p>Deprived by this means of a market for their hoof cattle, the
rustlers were compelled to butcher their cattle or drive to Montana.
The latter recourse was not only difficult and dangerous, but
there was no certainty of a market when accomplished, as the Live
Stock Association kept a vigilant watch on all Wyoming cattle.</p>

<p>The other scheme was unsatisfactory, but it was all that was
left to the rustlers. They employed a number of butchers at Buffalo
to do their killing for them, but even then they were not sure
of always getting their meat marketed.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1891 the rustlers ran waggons openly on all
the three great round-ups, and worked the round-up just as if
they were a regular Association outfit. They also gathered in
all the mavericks, and no one dared interfere.</p>

<p>It should be added that no more dangerous set of men can be found
anywhere than the Wyoming rustlers. No living being excels them
in horsemanship. The bucking pony is as a child in their hands.
There is not one among them who cannot rope, throw, tie and brand
a steer single-handed. They include the best riders and the best
shots in the cattle business. They do not know what fear is, and
in the year named became strong enough to elect one of their own
number sheriff.</p>
