Accordingly we went a-maying, following the lure of dancing winds
to a certain westward sloping hill lying under the spirit-like
blue of spring skies, feathered over with lisping young pines and
firs, which cupped little hollows and corners where the sunshine
got in and never got out again, but stayed there and grew mellow,
coaxing dear things to bloom long before they would dream of
waking up elsewhere.
<P>
'Twas there we found our mayflowers, after faithful seeking. 
Mayflowers, you must know, never flaunt themselves; they must be
sought as becomes them, and then they will yield up their
treasures to the seeker--clusters of star-white and dawn-pink that
have in them the very soul of all the springs that ever were, re-
incarnated in something it seems gross to call perfume, so
exquisite and spiritual is it.
<P>
We wandered gaily over the hill, calling to each other with
laughter and jest, getting parted and delightfully lost in that
little pathless wilderness, and finding each other unexpectedly in
nooks and dips and sunny silences, where the wind purred and
gentled and went softly.  When the sun began to hang low, sending
great fan-like streamers of radiance up to the zenith, we
foregathered in a tiny, sequestered valley, full of young green
fern, lying in the shadow of a wooded hill.  In it was a shallow
pool--a glimmering green sheet of water on whose banks nymphs
might dance as blithely as ever they did on Argive hill or in
Cretan dale.  There we sat and stripped the faded leaves and stems
from our spoil, making up the blossoms into bouquets to fill our
baskets with sweetness.  The Story Girl twisted a spray of
divinest pink in her brown curls, and told us an old legend of a
beautiful Indian maiden who died of a broken heart when the first
snows of winter were falling, because she believed her long-absent
lover was false.  But he came back in the spring time from his
long captivity; and when he heard that she was dead he sought her
grave to mourn her, and lo, under the dead leaves of the old year
he found sweet sprays of a blossom never seen before, and knew
that it was a message of love and remembrance from his dark-eyed
sweet-heart.
<P>
"Except in stories Indian girls are called squaws," remarked
practical Dan, tying his mayflowers together in one huge, solid,
cabbage-like bunch.  Not for Dan the bother of filling his basket
with the loose sprays, mingled with feathery elephant's-ears and
trails of creeping spruce, as the rest of us, following the Story
Girl's example, did.  Nor would he admit that ours looked any
better than his.
<P>
"I like things of one kind together.  I don't like them mixed," he
said.
<P>
"You have no taste," said Felicity.
<P>
"Except in my mouth, best beloved," responded Dan.
<P>
"You do think you are so smart," retorted Felicity, flushing with
anger.
<P>
"Don't quarrel this lovely day," implored Cecily.
<P>
"Nobody's quarrelling, Sis.  I ain't a bit mad.  It's Felicity. 
What on earth is that at the bottom of your basket, Cecily?"
<P>
"It's a History of the Reformation in France," confessed poor
Cecily, "by a man named D-a-u-b-i-g-n-y.  I can't pronounce it.  I
heard Mr. Marwood saying it was a book everyone ought to read, so
I began it last Sunday.  I brought it along today to read when I
got tired picking flowers.  I'd ever so much rather have brought
Ester Reid.  There's so much in the history I can't understand,
and it is so dreadful to read of people being burned to death. 
But I felt I OUGHT to read it."
<P>
"Do you really think your mind has improved any?" asked Sara Ray
seriously, wreathing the handle of her basket with creeping
spruce.
<P>
"No, I'm afraid it hasn't one bit," answered Cecily sadly.  "I
feel that I haven't succeeded very well in keeping my
resolutions."
<P>
"I've kept mine," said Felicity complacently.
<P>
"It's easy to keep just one," retorted Cecily, rather resentfully.
<P>
"It's not so easy to think beautiful thoughts," answered Felicity.
<P>
"It's the easiest thing in the world," said the Story Girl,
tiptoeing to the edge of the pool to peep at her own arch
reflection, as some nymph left over from the golden age might do. 
"Beautiful thoughts just crowd into your mind at times."
<P>
"Oh, yes, AT TIMES.  But that's different from thinking one
REGULARLY at a given hour.  And mother is always calling up the
stairs for me to hurry up and get dressed, and it's VERY hard
sometimes."
<P>
"That's so," conceded the Story Girl.  "There ARE times when I
can't think anything but gray thoughts.  Then, other days, I think
pink and blue and gold and purple and rainbow thoughts all the
time."
<P>
"The idea!  As if thoughts were coloured," giggled Felicity.
<P>
"Oh, they are!" cried the Story Girl.  "Why, I can always SEE the
colour of any thought I think.  Can't you?"
<P>
"I never heard of such a thing," declared Felicity, "and I don't
believe it.  I believe you are just making that up."
<P>
"Indeed I'm not.  Why, I always supposed everyone thought in
colours.  It must be very tiresome if you don't."
<P>
"When you think of me what colour is it?" asked Peter curiously.
<P>
"Yellow," answered the Story Girl promptly.  "And Cecily is a
sweet pink, like those mayflowers, and Sara Ray is very pale blue,
and Dan is red and Felix is yellow, like Peter, and Bev is
striped."
<P>
"What colour am I?" asked Felicity, amid the laughter at my
expense.
<P>
"You're--you're like a rainbow," answered the Story Girl rather
reluctantly.  She had to be honest, but she would rather not have
complimented Felicity.  "And you needn't laugh at Bev.  His
stripes are beautiful.  It isn't HE that is striped.  It's just
the THOUGHT of him.  Peg Bowen is a queer sort of yellowish green
and the Awkward Man is lilac.  Aunt Olivia is pansy-purple mixed
with gold, and Uncle Roger is navy blue."
<P>
"I never heard such nonsense," declared Felicity.  The rest of us
were rather inclined to agree with her for once.  We thought the
Story Girl was making fun of us.  But I believe she really had a
strange gift of thinking in colours.  In later years, when we were
grown up, she told me of it again.  She said that everything had
colour in her thought; the months of the year ran through all the
tints of the spectrum, the days of the week were arrayed as
Solomon in his glory, morning was golden, noon orange, evening
crystal blue, and night violet.  Every idea came to her mind robed
in its own especial hue.  Perhaps that was why her voice and words
had such a charm, conveying to the listeners' perception such fine
shadings of meaning and tint and music.
<P>
"Well, let's go and have something to eat," suggested Dan.  "What
colour is eating, Sara?"
<P>
"Golden brown, just the colour of a molasses cooky," laughed the
Story Girl.
<P>
We sat on the ferny bank of the pool and ate of the generous
basket Aunt Janet had provided, with appetites sharpened by the
keen spring air and our wilderness rovings.  Felicity had made
some very nice sandwiches of ham which we all appreciated except
Dan, who declared he didn't like things minced up and dug out of
the basket a chunk of boiled pork which he proceeded to saw up
with a jack-knife and devour with gusto.
<P>
"I told ma to put this in for me.  There's some CHEW to it," he
said.
<P>
"You are not a bit refined," commented Felicity.
<P>
"Not a morsel, my love," grinned Dan.
<P>
"You make me think of a story I heard Uncle Roger telling about
Cousin Annetta King," said the Story Girl.  "Great-uncle Jeremiah
King used to live where Uncle Roger lives now, when Grandfather
King was alive and Uncle Roger was a boy.  In those days it was
thought rather coarse for a young lady to have too hearty an
appetite, and she was more admired if she was delicate about what
she ate.  Cousin Annetta set out to be very refined indeed.  She
pretended to have no appetite at all.  One afternoon she was
invited to tea at Grandfather King's when they had some special
company--people from Charlottetown.  Cousin Annetta said she could
hardly eat anything.  'You know, Uncle Abraham,' she said, in a
very affected, fine-young-lady voice, 'I really hardly eat enough
to keep a bird alive.  Mother says she wonders how I continue to
exist.' And she picked and pecked until Grandfather King declared
he would like to throw something at her.  After tea Cousin Annetta
went home, and just about dark Grandfather King went over to Uncle
Jeremiah's on an errand.  As he passed the open, lighted pantry
window he happened to glance in, and what do you think he saw?
Delicate Cousin Annetta standing at the dresser, with a big loaf
of bread beside her and a big platterful of cold, boiled pork in
front of her; and Annetta was hacking off great chunks, like Dan
there, and gobbling them down as if she was starving.  Grandfather
King couldn't resist the temptation.  He stepped up to the window
and said, 'I'm glad your appetite has come back to you, Annetta. 
Your mother needn't worry about your continuing to exist as long
as you can tuck away fat, salt pork in that fashion.'
<P>
"Cousin Annetta never forgave him, but she never pretended to be
delicate again."
<P>
"The Jews don't believe in eating pork," said Peter.
<P>
"I'm glad I'm not a Jew and I guess Cousin Annetta was too," said
Dan.
<P>
"I like bacon, but I can never look at a pig without wondering if
they were ever intended to be eaten," remarked Cecily naively.
<P>
When we finished our lunch the barrens were already wrapping
themselves in a dim, blue dusk and falling upon rest in dell and
dingle.  But out in the open there was still much light of a fine
emerald-golden sort and the robins whistled us home in it.  "Horns
of Elfland" never sounded more sweetly around hoary castle and
ruined fane than those vesper calls of the robins from the
twilight spruce woods and across green pastures lying under the
pale radiance of a young moon.
<P>
When we reached home we found that Miss Reade had been up to the
hill farm on an errand and was just leaving.  The Story Girl went
for a walk with her and came back with an important expression on
her face.
<P>
"You look as if you had a story to tell," said Felix.
<P>
"One is growing.  It isn't a whole story yet," answered the Story
Girl mysteriously.
<P>
"What is it?" asked Cecily.
<P>
"I can't tell you till it's fully grown," said the Story Girl. 
"But I'll tell you a pretty little story the Awkward Man told us--
told me--tonight.  He was walking in his garden as we went by,
looking at his tulip beds.  His tulips are up ever so much higher
than ours, and I asked him how he managed to coax them along so
early.  And he said HE didn't do it--it was all the work of the
pixies who lived in the woods across the brook.  There were more
pixy babies than usual this spring, and the mothers were in a
hurry for the cradles.  The tulips are the pixy babies' cradles,
it seems.  The mother pixies come out of the woods at twilight and
rock their tiny little brown babies to sleep in the tulip cups. 
That is the reason why tulip blooms last so much longer than other
blossoms.  The pixy babies must have a cradle until they are grown
up.  They grow very fast, you see, and the Awkward Man says on a
spring evening, when the tulips are out, you can hear the
sweetest, softest, clearest, fairy music in his garden, and it is
the pixy folk singing as they rock the pixy babies to sleep."
<P>
"Then the Awkward Man says what isn't true," said Felicity
severely.
