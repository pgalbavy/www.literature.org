<p>Fred Linden walked rapidly forward until he reached the middle
of the prairie, when he paused and bent his eyes on the swiftly
vanishing drove of buffaloes. They were speeding at right angles
to the course he had been following, and, so far as he could judge
at the distance, were on the same dead run with which they started.</p>

<p>He was convinced that he was mistaken a brief while before, when,
for a moment, he thought he caught a glimpse of Terry on the back
of the terrified bull. He was unable to distinguish any thing
that looked like him. He might&mdash;and it was not at all improbable&mdash;be
still clinging to his steed, but he was too far off and too mixed
up with the others for even the keen eyes of Fred Linden to identify
him.</p>

<p>There seemed but the one thing to do: that was to follow the
drove until he learned the fate of his friend. Certain that he
would find him sooner or later, Fred resorted again to his loping
trot, which he could keep up for several hours without great fatigue.</p>

<p>But he had not gone twenty steps at this gait, when, to his astonishment
and alarm, he observed three Indian warriors, each mounted on
a horse, issue from the wood at the point where the buffaloes
would have entered it had they not turned to the left. The red
men headed their animals directly toward Fred, and advanced at
a moderate gallop.</p>

<p>The sight was enough to make the bravest person thoughtful; for
you will readily see the critical situation of the boy. It was
useless to turn and run, for they would overhaul him before he
could get half way to cover. He was in the middle of a grassy
prairie, where there was not the slightest object which could
be used as a screen in a fight with them. He glanced quickly about,
but did not see a stone as large as his hand. Except so far as
his weapons were concerned, he was absolutely helpless.</p>

<p>Never did Fred Linden display more coolness and knowledge of
Indian character than he did at this time when caught at such
fearful disadvantage. He knew that if he showed any timidity,
the red men would attack him at once, while, if he could deceive
them, as he hoped, there was a possibility that he would escape.</p>

<p>Two hundred yards away, the Indians drew their cantering horses
down to a walk: they evidently saw there was no call for haste
and they could afford to take all the time they wished. They were
riding beside each other, instead of in Indian file, and being
nigh enough to be observed distinctly, showed that they were dressed
precisely like the Winnebagos whom he had noticed the night before
around their camp-fire. This might have been, had they belonged
to another totem, for there is a similarity in the dress of different
tribes, but Fred had no doubt that these were Winnebagos. It began
to look indeed as if there was an irruption of them into that
section of the Louisiana Territory.</p>

<p>During those trying moments, when Fred calmly watched the approach
of the dusky horsemen, he was observant of the smallest things.
He recalled that they were the same in number as the party which
he and Terry so narrowly missed the night before on the edge of
the stream and he half suspected they were the same, though such
supposition did not correspond with the theories formed and accepted
at the time.</p>

<p>He saw the middle horse, which was darker in color than the others,
slightly stumble; then the rider turned his head and said something
to the warrior on his left, who made answer without taking his
eyes from Fred; then the one on the right said something, his
painted features relaxing into a frightful grin, the guttural
words being plainly audible: all these points being noticed, as
I have said, by the young hunter who had so much more important
matters to engage his thoughts.</p>

<p>He recalled with relief that on picking up the gun of Terry he
had reloaded it, so that he now had two weapons ready for use.
With these he could make a brave resistance, and you may depend
upon it that the last thing he thought of doing was to surrender.
He might easily be shot down where he stood, but he would die
fighting.</p>

<p>The three horsemen advanced with the same deliberate pace, their
black eyes fixed upon Fred, who stood erect, looking straight
at them. When they were within twenty yards, he quietly turned
so as to face the other way, and waved his cap several times over
his head. At the same moment he uttered a resounding whoop, replaced
his cap, laid Terry's rifle at his feet and leveled his own at
the amazed savages, who could not have suspected what was coming.</p>

<p>You understand that the purpose of Fred was to make the Winnebagos
believe that he had friends on the edge of the wood behind him
to whom he had signaled. The act of laying down his gun was to
give the impression that he was so sure of support that he was
ready to fight until it should appear.</p>

<p>Now, the red men might have been deceived by this to as full
an extent as the youth desired, but the fact remained that, even
if there were re-enforcements on the margin of the prairie, they
were so far off that they could give no help if the Indians chose
to assail the boy. I am inclined to think that had the Winnebagos
believed that a dozen white hunters were encamped there, they
would not have been restrained from carrying out their design
by such fact: but when the cool defiance of the youth was added
to the same, there was enough to make them pause.</p>

<p>They might shoot him down, wheel and dash for the woods from
which they had emerged but a short time before; but they would
be liable to pursuit, and, when a white borderer takes to the
trail, he can be as persistent as the red man himself, though,
as I have said, had they been eager to shoot the boy, they would
not have been stopped by that knowledge. But they saw that he
had his loaded rifle leveled at them: each Winnebago probably
imagined he would be the special target. Their guns were still
in their hands and no doubt the moment any one attempted to raise
his weapon the white boy would fire.</p>

<p>The distance was so short that there could be no miss. It followed
therefore that the cost of an assault upon the lad would be the
death of one of the Winnebagos, and none of the three could know
that he would not be the victim.</p>

<p>The cost was more than they were willing to pay, for it must
be borne in mind that not only was the death of one of their number
considered assured, but it was not at all unlikely that such a
daring youngster would be able to do something with the gun at
his feet before succumbing.</p>

<p>But it is not to be supposed that three mounted Indians would
deliberately ride away from a single youth through fear alone,&mdash;that
is, not until they had tried to circumvent him by strategy. And
so it came to pass that within the same minute that Fred raised
his rifle, the Winnebago who sat in the middle waved his hand
toward him as a sign of comity. At the same time he called out:
"Yenghese! Long Knife! Friend&mdash;friend&mdash;friend!"</p>

<p>But Fred knew too much to be deceived. He was the master of more
vigorous English, and, without lowering his gun, he called out:</p>

<p>"Keep off or I'll fire! If you ride another step, I'll let daylight
through you!"</p>

<p>As if to add emphasis to his words, he gently swayed his rifle
from right to left, so that it covered each warrior in turn. There
was an involuntary ducking of the heads, and the Indians, seeing
that nothing was to be done without large risk, opened out&mdash;two
riding to the right and one to the left. Thus they passed by Fred
without lessening the space between him and them.</p>

<p>After all, this was the most trying moment to the youth, for
it diverted his attention in the most exasperating manner. The
three horsemen were in his field of vision, but it was hard to
keep watch upon each. He suspected the maneuver was for the purpose
of taking him off his guard, but it is doubtful whether such was
the case, for there was something in the grim pose of the youthful
hunter which warned them that it was unsafe to trifle with him.</p>

<p>When the horsemen were opposite each other and on a line with
Fred, he suddenly wheeled with great quickness and held his piece
still leveled so that he could shift it from one to the other
the moment needed. On their part, the Winnebagos watched him with
cat-like vigilance, keeping their heads turned until they came
together a hundred feet beyond, and between him and the wood which
he had just left. There they stopped, their position such that
the sides of their animals were turned toward the lad, whom they
continued to view with an interest that it is safe to say they
had never felt in any other of his race.</p>

<p>It was tiresome to hold his heavy rifle leveled, but Fred stuck
to it, for he knew how much depended on the next minute or two.</p>

<p>It looked for a time as though the Winnebagos had decided not
to leave without a demonstration, but finally they moved off with
their backs toward Fred, and their horses on a walk.</p>

<p>"How nicely I could pick one of them off," said he to himself,
as the broad shoulders, with the black hair streaming over them,
moved gently up and down with the motion of the animals, and ranged
themselves beside each other like three dusky targets. "I could
hit <em>him</em> or <em>him</em> or <em>him</em>" he added, shifting
his aim from one to the other in turn, "and it's because they
know it that they are afraid to risk a shot. If one of them had
made a motion to take aim, I would have let fly, and I wouldn't
have missed either. Then I would have done something with Terry's
gun."</p>

<p>These thoughts had hardly found expression, when the middle Winnebago
suddenly turned on his horse, raised his gun and discharged it
at Fred Linden. The instant he did so, he and his two companions
threw themselves forward on their animals and dashed off on a
dead run for the wood.</p>

<p>Had the warrior been less hurried, it is probable he would have
struck the astonished youth, who plainly heard the <em>pinge</em>
of the bullet as it almost touched his ear. His own arms were
beginning to ache because of their constrained position, but he
took as careful aim as possible and fired at the savage who fired
at him.</p>

<p>More than that, he hit him. A screeching yawp broke the stillness,
the warrior half straightened up on his steed, seemed to sway,
and would have fallen had not one of his companions caught his
shoulder and supported him for a minute or two. The horses were
brought down to a walk, and finally came to a standstill, though
they halted at a point beyond rifle shot.</p>

<p>"I hope I finished him," muttered Fred Linden, with a snap of
his eyes; "they are seeking my life, and, if I could have my way,
I would tumble every one of them off his horse."</p>

<p>Never was the value of two rifles shown more strikingly than
at this time. The moment his gun was discharged&mdash;had he possessed
no other &mdash;Fred would have been helpless, and the Winnebagos
would have been upon him before he could reload his piece; for
that was in the days of flint-locks, when the charge had to be
rammed down and the powder poured into the pan before the weapon
was ready for use. It may be said, however, that under such circumstances
he would not have fired.</p>

<p>But before the horsemen could wheel about, they would have found
the youth standing at "present arms" precisely as before, and
the situation unchanged, except that one of their own number had
been disabled, and to that extent (which was considerable) the
gain was on the side of the lad.</p>

<p>There could be little doubt that the stricken Winnebago was hit
hard, though after some attention from his companions, he was
able to sit his horse. The three warriors seemed to have lost
all interest in Fred, for a few minutes later they rode off at
a walk, without, so far as he could judge, once bestowing a look
upon him.</p>

<p>It struck him as singular that after his stratagem, by which
he believed he gave the impression that he had a party of friends
on the margin of the wood, that the Winnebagos should guide their
horses to the very point. After all, it began to look as though
he was not so successful in that respect as he imagined, and that
it was his own courageous demeanor that for the time had saved
his life.</p>

<p>"I am glad they have ridden off in that direction," said the
youth to himself, as he saw them carefully enter the wood, where
they were lost from sight; "for if they had ridden the other way
they would have bothered me in my hunt for Terry."</p>
