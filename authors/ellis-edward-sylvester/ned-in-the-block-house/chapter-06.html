<p>The block-house, known near a century ago as Fort Bridgman, stood
on the right bank of the Licking river in Kentucky, and was some
thirty odd miles southwest of the present city of Maysville.</p>

<p>The block-house proper was a substantial structure of heavy logs,
and consisted of only two rooms&mdash;one above and below. The lower
story was a dozen yards square, and the upper was two feet greater
in each direction, for the builders followed the frontier fashion
of projecting the second story over the first. This projection
being pierced with portholes, gave opportunity to the garrison
to fire down on the heads of their assailants, who might attempt
to batter down the door, or make a rush for the interior.</p>

<p>The roof was so steeply shelving that the most agile Indian could
not sustain himself on it. On each side was a trap-door, intended
for use in emergency. The roof itself was composed of thick slabs
of oak, and, like the logs, doors, and every portion of the building,
was bullet-proof.</p>

<p>The structure stood at the angle of a square of one hundred feet,
which was inclosed by a strong stockade. This consisted of logs
split through the middle, one end sharpened and driven deep into
the earth, leaving the upper portions, which were of irregular
height, nine or ten feet above the ground.</p>

<p>Standing at the angle of this square, it will be seen that the
block-house formed a part of two sides. On that which faced the
Licking was a door and one window; on the opposite side, which
opened into the stockade or inclosure, were also a door and window.
On the other two sides were two windows, but no door; the former
were so narrow that no Indian warrior could force his way through
them, while the doors of puncheon slabs would have resisted for
a long time the pounding of a battering-ram. The windows were
all on the ground floor.</p>

<p>The fort having been built expressly for defensive purposes,
where the peril was known to be great, it lacked nothing which
the rude frontier warfare could suggest. It was so abundantly
pierced with loop-holes that the garrison commanded every approach.</p>

<p>If the red men attempted to scale the stockade at any point,
they had to expose themselves to the bullets of the unerring Kentuckians
behind the logs; while, if they secured a closer approach on in
the darkness of night, the defenders could shoot them through
the loopholes in the projecting floor above.</p>

<p>There was a gate on each side of the stockade, except on that
furthest removed from the block-house. Only one of these was used,
and that was on the southern side. The wooden chimney was at the
corner, entirely within the stockade, and the numerous attacks
which the structure had repelled proved, more than anything else,
the strength and power of resistance of the defence.</p>

<p>The interior of the fort, as some called it, was of the most
primitive character. Below was a rough slab floor, with a fireplace,
the smoke from which found its vent up the wooden chimney. There
were a bench, a table, and several rude chairs, while a barrel
of corn-meal was generally kept pretty well filled against the
emergency which all felt was liable to arise without an hour's
notice.</p>

<p>The second story, although larger, as we have already stated,
was furnished with the same simplicity. It was supposed that,
in case of danger, this floor would be used more than the other
by the defenders. It had the two trap-doors in the steep roof,
and was liberally ventilated by means of the numerous loopholes
which let in bars of light from every direction, and permitted
the outlook to take in as extensive a vision as though the spectator
was not surrounded by any walls at all.</p>

<p>Fort Bridgman faced the Licking river on the west, the stockade
extending eastward. It was originally intended to embrace the
six cabins which were put up by the settlers, but these were finally
left outside, and the inclosed square looked like a small parade-ground,
to be used for the benefit of the garrison. It contained near
the centre a well, to be appealed to in emergency, though it was
not placed within the building itself, so as to shut off the possibility
of its being seized by an attacking force. Colonel Preston more
than once had expressed a purpose to have such a well dug, but
it was deferred from time to time until, as is generally the case,
the necessity was forgotten altogether.</p>

<p>In the roomy upper story of the block-house was always kept a
barrel of water, blankets, a few chairs, a number of axes, shovels,
spades, picks, and utensils useful in a new settlement. Fort Bridgman
at one time promised to become an important town in Kentucky;
but a fierce raid by a band of red men, one tempestuous night
in mid-winter, destroyed every cabin except the block-house, in
which only a few settlers found safe refuge from the vengeful
warriors.</p>

<p>In the autumn of which we are speaking there were only two cabins
beside the defence. These stood outside the stockade, and one
was occupied by Colonel Hugh Preston, his wife Maria, and his
two daughters &mdash;Mary, aged ten, and Susie, eight years old.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger, an old Indian fighter of the early days in Kentucky,
made his home with the family, while Jim Turner and Sam Megill
occupied the other. The last two were brothers-in-law, and it
was the intention of the latter to bring his wife and three children
from Wild Oaks in the spring to live in the dwelling which he
had taken so much pains to erect and fit for their coming.</p>

<p>Such was the garrison of the block-house in the autumn when Colonel
Preston, while hunting in the woods, learned of the presence of
a war party of Wyandots. It was by a pure accident, or rather
providence, that he discovered the alarming fact, and he lost
not a moment in improving the important knowledge.</p>

<p>He hastened home, and the settlers gathered in the block-house,
with such extra provisions, blankets, fuel, and other necessaries
as they could get together. The doors of the building and the
gates of the stockade were fastened, and the men stationed themselves
in the most available points to detect the approach of their enemies.</p>

<p>The little garrison were none too soon in these preparations,
for within the succeeding half hour the Wyandots were seen on
the edge of the woods, and creeping along the bank of the Licking
one hundred yards away. They were quick to note that, with all
their secrecy of movement, their approach had been discovered;
if they had any doubts on the point, they were removed by a couple
of rifle-shots that were sent hurtling among the bushes which
partly concealed their bodies.</p>

<p>"It's a great disappointment to them," said Jo Stinger, as he
peered through a loophole, "for they had every reason to believe
we would be surprised."</p>

<p>"I hope it will be so much of a disappointment that they will
postpone the siege," remarked the Colonel.</p>

<p>The old hunter shook his head, and added&mdash;</p>

<p>"That depends very much on how many redskins are out there. If
the party is not very large, they will be apt to give it up; but
if there are as many as I fear, the varmints will hang on, in
the hope of cleanin' us out."</p>

<p>"They will have no easy task to do that," remarked the Colonel,
with a flash of the eye; "this isn't the first time it has been
tried, and it won't be the first time it has failed."</p>

<p>"Suppose it is a success?" said his wife gently.</p>

<p>The Colonel turned when he heard the familiar voice at his elbow,
and, as he noticed Mary and Susie playing on the floor, something
like a pang went to his heart. The sight caused him to feel more
vividly than ever before the dreadful meaning of the word "failure,"
which had just passed the lips of his beloved wife.</p>

<p>"Failure!" he repeated, as he placed his arm affectionately on
her shoulder; "do you regard it possible, when I have <em>you</em>
and the little ones depending on us?"</p>

<p>"I know every man, and myself as well, will fight to the end,
but even that does not always avail: the bravest must succumb
when the assailants overwhelm them."</p>

<p>Tears glistened in her eyes, as she tried hard to look courageous,
but a mother lives in her affections, and no one could have felt
more deeply than did she, that all she valued in the world was
at that moment within the wooden walls of the block-house, while
a merciless foe was on the outside, as eager as so many jungle
tigers to reach them.</p>

<p>"We have an abundance of ammunition," added the husband, seeking
to hide a vague fear which was creeping over him; "and we can
stand a longer siege than the Indians will care to maintain against
us."</p>

<p>"I trust so, but I cannot feel the hope which sustains you: I
wish you would send word to your brother at Wild Oaks, that he
may give us help before it is too late."</p>

<p>This plan, although not named until now, was in the minds of
more than one member of the garrison. Colonel Preston had asked
himself whether it was not the prudent thing to do, and he looked
at Jo Stinger to learn what he thought of it.</p>

<p>The old scout nodded his head in a way to signify he was favorable,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's the right thing, Colonel, and I'm the man to do it."</p>

<p>"But how can you get out? The Indians will be on the watch, and
we are too few in number to spare a man."</p>

<p>"Didn't I carry the news to Wild Oaks two years ago, when it
looked as though all of us was going under sure?"</p>

<p>"You did&mdash;that's a fact; but was the risk as great as now?"</p>

<p>"I think this is no greater, and it may not be as great: that's
to be found out. That time, I took three hours to get through
the red skin lines; but when I had shook 'em clear, I done some
of the tallest traveling of my life."</p>

<p>"If you think it best, you may try it after dark."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said the settler, with a compression of the lips
which showed his earnestness. He had perilled his life many a
time during the years spent on the frontier, and he was not the
man to hesitate, when duty called him.</p>

<p>It was now the middle of the afternoon of the blustery autumn
day which saw the approach of Ned Preston, Blossom Brown and the
Shawanoe, Deerfoot, to the vicinity of the block-house. The garrison
were sure to use the utmost vigilance until the all-important
question was settled, and it was not probable the besieging Wyandots
would make any serious attack before the night was well advanced.</p>

<p>When Megill, a tall, sinewy, iron-limbed pioneer, learned the
intention of Stinger to make the attempt to reach Wild Oaks with
a view of bringing help, he commended the plan and said he would
gladly take his place. But Stinger would not consent, and it was
understood that the dangerous task was to be undertaken by him
who proposed it.</p>

<p>As the chilly night settled over river, forest and clearing,
every one in the block-house was impressed with the solemnity
of the situation. Even little Mary and Susie talked in hushed
voices of the wicked Indians on the outside, and wondered why
they wished to harm those who had never harmed them. When they
knelt at their mother's knee, their prayers were touching in their
earnestness and simple faith, and brought tears to the eyes of
their parents.</p>

<p>"God will take care of us," said Mary to the elder, with the
trusting belief of childhood; "so don't feel bad, papa and mamma."</p>

<p>The mother had made them a bed in the corner, beyond the reach
of any stray bullets that might find their way through the loopholes;
and, as she tucked the blankets around them and kissed them good-night,
she added her own petition to heaven that it would guard and shield
them from all harm.</p>

<p>Stinger, Megill and Turner were at the loopholes; and, while
the twilight was deepening within the gloomy block-house, Colonel
Preston lingered a few minutes beside his wife, who was seated
on a rude stool waiting for the little ones to close their eyes
in slumber.</p>

<p>"Why should we feel alarmed, Maria," he asked, "when, as I told
you a short time ago, we have plenty of ammunition and the means
to defend ourselves? There are five rifles, one for each of us,
including yourself; these walls are too strong to be battered
down, and we can make our aim too sure for the Wyandots to expose
themselves long to it."</p>

<p>"That is all true, Hugh, and I hope that nothing I have said
will cause misgiving on your part; but, at the best, there are
only a very, <em>very</em> few of us, and you know accidents may
happen: suppose," she added in a tremulous voice, "one or two
of you should fall&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Colonel, begging pardon," interrupted Jo Stinger, at this moment
advancing toward them, "you obsarve it's so dark inside that we
couldn't see each other's faces if it wasn't for that taller candle
burning on the stand, and I don't know of a better time to start
for Wild Oaks."</p>

<p>"Is it fully dark on the outside?" asked the Colonel, glad of
excuse to end the gloomy conversation.</p>

<p>"As dark as a wolf's mouth&mdash;so dark that I'm hopeful of getting
through the lines, without any bother; you know that every hour
counts, and I shall have to put in some big licks to reach Wild
Oaks and bring the boys here by to-morrow night."</p>

<p>There could be no disputing this fact, and Colonel Preston peeped
through the loopholes, first on one side of the block-house and
then on the other, until he had looked toward each point of the
compass.</p>

<p>It may be said that nothing but blank darkness met his eye. He
could hear the sound of the flowing river, the solemn sighing
of the night-wind among the trees, but nowhere could he catch
the glimmer of the Indian camp-fire, nor hear the red man's war-whoop
which had fallen on his ear more than once since he made his home
on the Dark and Bloody Ground.</p>

<p>This impressive stillness told as eloquently of the presence
of the red man as the sounds of conflict could have done.</p>

<p>"There is no need of waiting longer," remarked the Colonel.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he began descending the ladder, which answered for
the stairs, Stinger following him. On the lower floor there was
not the slightest ray of light, but both were so familiar with
the room that they needed no lamp.</p>

<p>Reaching the door, Colonel Preston placed his hand on the heavy
bars which held it in place, and the two listened for several
minutes. Nothing was heard, and the fastenings were drawn with
much care and in almost complete silence.</p>

<p>"If you have to come back," whispered the commandant, "give the
signal and I will let you in."</p>

<p>"I'll do so;&mdash;good bye," and, without any more words, the scout
vanished in the gloom.</p>

<p>To the consternation of Colonel Preston, he heard the familiar
whistle of Stinger a couple of hours later, at which time he hoped
he was well on his way to Wild Oaks.</p>

<p>The messenger was safely admitted within the block-house shortly
after, and his first words were&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's no use, Colonel; a rabbit couldn't creep through the lines,
they're watching so close."</p>
