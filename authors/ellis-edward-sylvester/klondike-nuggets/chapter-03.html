<p>Roswell and Frank were standing in front of one of the curio
stores, studying the interesting exhibits, among which was a pan
of Klondike gold, but they kept watch of the stranger, who slouched
up to them and halted at the side of Frank.</p>

<p>"I say, pards," he said in the gruff, wheedling tones of the
professional tramp, "can't you do something for a chap that's
down on his luck?"</p>

<p>As the lads turned to face him they saw an unclean, tousled man,
very tall, with stooping shoulders, protruding black eyes, spiky
hair, and a generally repellent appearance.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" asked Frank, looking into the face that
had not been shaven for several days.</p>

<p>"Had the worst sort of luck; got back from Klondike two days
ago with thirty thousand dollars, and robbed of every cent. I'm
dead broke."</p>

<p>"You seem to have had enough to buy whiskey," remarked Roswell,
who had had a whiff of his breath, and placed no faith in his
story. The man looked angrily at them, but restrained himself,
in hopes of receiving help.</p>

<p>"There's where you're mistaken, my friends; I haven't had anything
to eat for two days, and when a stranger offered me a swallow
of whiskey to keep up my strength, I took it, as a medicine. If
it hadn't been for that, I'd have flunked right in the street&mdash;sure
as you live. What are you doing, if I may ask, in Juneau?"</p>

<p>"We are listening to you just now, but we are on our way to the
gold fields," replied Roswell.</p>

<p>"Not alone?"</p>

<p>"We are going with two men, one of whom has been there before."</p>

<p>"That's more sensible. Let me give you a little advice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We really do not feel the need of it," interposed Roswell, who
liked the man less each minute. "You must excuse us, as we wish
to join them at the hotel. Good-day."</p>

<p>"See here," said the fellow angrily, as he laid his hand on the
arm of Frank; "ain't you going to stake me a bit?"</p>

<p>The lad shook off his grasp.</p>

<p>"Even if we wished to do so, we could not, for our friend at
the hotel has all the funds that belong to our party. Perhaps
if you go there, and he believes the story, Mr. Graham may do
something for you, but Tim McCabe has not the means with which
to help anybody."</p>

<p>At mention of the Irishman's name the fellow showed some agitation.
Then, seeing that he was about to lose the expected aid, he uttered
a savage expression and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word you say."</p>

<p>"It is no concern of ours whether you believe it or not," replied
Roswell, as he and Frank started down the street toward their
hotel. The fellow was amazed at the defiance of the lads, and
stood staring at them and muttering angrily to himself. Could
he have carried out his promptings, he would have robbed both,
but was restrained by several reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place, Juneau, despite the influx of miners, is
a law-abiding city, and the man's arrest and punishment would
have followed speedily. Moreover, it would not have been an altogether
"sure thing" for him to attack the youths. They were exceptionally
tall, active and strong, and would have given him trouble without
appeal to the firearms which they carried.</p>

<p>They looked round and smiled, but he did not follow them. When
they reached the hotel they related the incident.</p>

<p>"Would ye oblige me with a description of the spalpeen?" said
Tim McCabe, after they had finished. Roswell did as requested.</p>

<p>"Be the powers, it's him!" exclaimed Tim. "I 'spected it when
ye told the yarn which I've heerd he has been telling round town."</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Hardman, Ike Hardman himsilf."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell ye he was the one that robbed me of my money?
Sure I did, what is the matter wid ye?"</p>

<p>"You told us about being robbed," said Jeff, "but didn't mention
the name of the man who did it."</p>

<p>"I want to inthrodooce mesilf to him!" exclaimed Tim, flushed
with indignation; "axscoose me for a bit."</p>

<p>He strode to the door with the intention of hunting up and chastising
the rogue, but, with his hand on the knob, checked himself. For
a moment he debated with himself, and then, as his broad face
lit up with his natural good humor, he came back to his chair,
paraphrasing Uncle Toby:</p>

<p>"The world's big enough for the likes of him and me, though he
does crowd a bit. Let him git all the good out of the theft he
can, say I."</p>

<p>Dyea is at the head of navigation, and is the timber line, being
a hundred miles to the northwest of Juneau. It is at the upper
fork of what is termed Lynn Canal, the most extensive fiord on
the coast. It is, in truth, a continuation of Chatham Strait,
the north and south passage being several hundred miles in extent,
the whole forming the trough of a glacier which disappeared ages
ago.</p>

<p>On the day following the incident described our friends boarded
the little, untidy steam launch bound for Dyea. There were fifty
passengers beside themselves, double the number it was intended
to carry, the destination of all being the gold fields. The weather
was keen and biting, and the accommodations on the boat poor.
They pushed here and there, surveying with natural interest the
bleak scenery along shore, the mountains white with snow, and
foretelling the more terrible regions that lay beyond. Hundreds
of miles remained to be traversed before they could expect to
gather the yellow particles, but neither of the sturdy lads felt
any abatement of courage.</p>

<p>"Well, look at that!" suddenly exclaimed Roswell, catching the
arm of his companion as they were making their way toward the
front of the boat.</p>

<p>Frank turned in the direction indicated, and his astonishment
was as great as his companion's. Tim McCabe and the shabby scamp,
Ike Hardman, were sitting near each other on a bench, and smoking
their pipes like two affectionate brothers. No one would have
suspected there had ever been a ripple between them.</p>

<p>Catching the eye of the amazed boys, Tim winked and threw up
his chin as an invitation for them to approach. Frank shook his
head, and he and Roswell went back to where Jeff was smoking his
pipe. They had hardly time to tell their story when the Irishman
joined them.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>CATCHING THE EYE OF THE AMAZED BOYS, TIM WINKED</em>.]</p>

<p>"I obsarved by the exprission on your faces that ye were a bit
surprised," he said, addressing the youths.</p>

<p>"Is that fellow the Hardman you told us about?" asked Roswell.</p>

<p>"The same at your sarvice."</p>

<p>"And the man who robbed you of your money?"</p>

<p>Tim flung one of his muscular legs over the other, and with a
twinkle of the eyes said:</p>

<p>"Hardman has made it all right; the matter is fixed atween oursilves."</p>

<p>"Then he give you back your money?" was the inquiring remark
of Jeff.</p>

<p>"Not precisely that, though he said he would do the same if he
only had it with him, but he run up agin a game at Juneau and
was cleaned out. Whin he told me that I was a bit sorry for him.
He further obsarved that it was his intintion if he won to stake
me agin and add something extra for interest on what he borrowed
of me. That spakes well for Hardman, so we shook hands over it,"
was the hearty conclusion of Tim.</p>

<p>The boys were too astonished to speak. Jeff Graham's shoulders
shook, and he looked sideways at his friend with a quizzical expression,
unable to do justice to his feelings. As for Tim, his red face
was the picture of bland innocence, but he was not through. Astounding
as were the statements he had just made, he had a still more astounding
one to submit.</p>
