<p>It was Tom Gordon's turn now to be frightened.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, almost leaping from his feet; "the tiger
coming this way! How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"I seed him! Ain't that enough? He started right up the road
on a gallop, with the blood dripping from his jaws!"</p>

<p>"But where is he now?"</p>

<p>"He went a little way, stopping now and then to swaller some
one that warn't quick 'nough to git out of his path; he went over
the hill this side of Briggsville, where you know we couldn't
see him. By that time a whole lot of the folks had guns, and started
after him. Being on my way home, I jined 'em. When we got to the
top of the hill, old Tippo Sahib couldn't be seen anywhere."</p>

<p>"Aren't you afeard to go home?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not," replied Jimmy, rapidly regaining courage;
"I know how to fix him if he comes after me."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"All I've got to do is to stop short and look him right in the
eye. A chap mustn't tremble, but look hard and stern."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you do that, Jim, when he first broke out of his
cage?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't time! I'll do it if I meet him agin. Remember, Tom,
if you run against him, you must fix your eyes on him and not
wink. <em>That'll</em> fetch him every time."</p>

<p>"But s'posin' it doesn't?"</p>

<p>"If you should have to wink, and he comes for you, why all you've
got to do is to haul off with your foot and kick him awful hard
under the jaw; that'll fix him! But you mustn't be barefooted,
or you'll hurt your toes. And you must kick hard 'nough too,"
added the budding naturalist, "to knock his jaw off. Then of course
he can't bite."</p>

<p>The scheme was a brilliant one, perhaps; but young as was Tom
Gordon, he felt that the difficulty lay in its application.</p>

<p>"Gracious! Jim! the tiger is stirring up things, isn't he? We've
got a gun in the house, and if he visits us I think I'll try that."</p>

<p>"Do you know where to hit him?" asked Jim, who, having fully
recovered his wind, seemed at the same time to have regained a
vast amount of curious knowledge of natural history.</p>

<p>"I s'pose in the head is as good as any place."</p>

<p>"Don't you think of such a thing! He don't mind being hit in
the head more than you do getting hit by a spit-ball. You must
aim for his tail!"</p>

<p>"How can that hurt him?" asked the amazed Tom.</p>

<p>"Why, I seed the balls that hit his head glance off and scoot
up in the air, like skipping stones over the water. A tiger uses
his tail to balance himself with. Shoot off his tail, and he loses
his balance. Every time he tries to walk, he tips over. Don't
forget, Tom, if you shoot, to aim at his tail, just where it is
stuck onto his body. If you miss, look him in the eye; and if
that doesn't stop him, let drive with your foot under the jaw,
and don't forget to have your shoes on. Well, I must go home to
tell the folks to git ready," added Jim, loping off like an Indian
starting on a long journey.</p>

<p>Tom had caught the contagion of excitement, and the moment his
friend left he made a dash for the door of his home, bursting
in upon his mother and aunt with the astounding news just received
from his playmate.</p>

<p>Strange women would they have been not to have been wrought up
by the alarming tidings. Brushing aside the chaff, there remained
the wheat in Jim's words to the effect that the tiger, one of
the finest of his kind ever seen in captivity, had broken out
of his cage, injured, if not killed, a number of people, and was
in the immediate neighborhood, with the prospect of paying a visit
to this home.</p>

<p>"The gun is loaded," said the mother, turning slightly pale;
"but I don't think one of those animals will attempt to enter
a house."</p>

<p>"I have read that in India," remarked her sister-in-law, "they
follow the natives into their houses, and tear down the structures
in their fury."</p>

<p>"But their dwellings are made of light bamboo, and are frail
structures."</p>

<p>"We may as well be on the right side," remarked the other, stepping
hastily to the door. But just before reaching it, the latch flew
up, and Jim Travers plunged in, falling on his hands and knees,
the picture of terror itself.</p>

<p>"Shut the door quick!" he gasped. "The tiger is coming; he's
coming; he's right behind me."</p>

<p>In a twinkling, Aunt Cynthia sprang forward, caught the latch,
and slid the heavy bar in place, while the mother hastened to
the window.</p>

<p>"Look out!" called Jim, clambering to his feet; "he'll spring
right through and chaw you up, quicker'n lightning."</p>

<p>But the brave parent not only threw up the window and bolted
the shutters, but did it coolly and deftly with each window, front
and back, thus shrouding the room in obscurity.</p>

<p>Tom climbed into a chair set in front of the fireplace, and took
down the loaded rifle, which he knew how to use as well as any
boy of his years.</p>

<p>"Come, Jim, let's go up-stairs to my bedroom; maybe we can get
a shot at him."</p>

<p>At the top of the stairs the leader paused and turned about.</p>

<p>"Say, Jim, did you try to look in the tiger's eye?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Don't bother me with such foolish questions; I hadn't a chance."</p>

<p>"How was it?"</p>

<p>"Why, I hadn't got far from the house, when I heered a growl,
and there was the tiger in the field, looking over the fence at
me."</p>

<p>"Seems to me that was just the chance you wanted, if he was looking
at you."</p>

<p>"I s'pose it was; but to own up, Tom, I didn't think of it. I
was afeard he would go for your folks. So I thought I would walk
down and tell you."</p>

<p>"Did you walk all the way?"</p>

<p>"I may have hurried a little,&mdash;that is, a part of the way. I
would have turned round and let him have my foot under the jaw,
but I was afeard my shoe would give out."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the two boys walked softly to the front window of
Tom's bedroom, and cautiously peered out.</p>

<p>"Sh! I b'lieve I see him," whispered the young host.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked his companion in the same guarded manner.</p>

<p>"Under the oak; he's standing still just now. There! he's creeping
off toward the woodshed."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's him! that's him! I know it. Hadn't you better let
me take a shot?"</p>

<p>"I can shoot as well as you."</p>

<p>Tom was right. He was looking upon the royal Bengal tiger and
no mistake. He had halted under a large oak, standing on the other
side of the road, and seemed to be debating with himself what
he should do next.</p>

<p>The rattle of a coming wagon attracted his attention, and he
crouched down, as if preparing to spring upon the driver and his
animals.</p>

<p>"Just watch him chaw up the horses and the man!" whispered Jim.</p>

<p>"If he means to do that, I'd better shoot," said Tom, setting
down his gun and silently raising the window.</p>

<p>"You can't do it now, for he's almost behind the tree."</p>

<p>"His head shows, and I guess that's better than his tail."</p>

<p>Tom rested the heavy barrel of the rifle on the window-sill,
and knelt down to make his aim sure. Before, however, he could
obtain a good sight, the old farmer came so nearly opposite that
he was obliged to restrain his fire through fear of hitting him
or his horses.</p>

<p>The boys held their breath, certain of the awful occurrence at
hand. But the tiger just then seemed to be in a magnanimous mood.
Possibly he was satiated with what he had already devoured in
the way of horses, men, women, and children. Be that as it may,
the farmer and his team never suspected their peril, if, in point
of fact, any peril threatened them. The animals jogged along,
with the man half asleep on the front seat, his idle whip sloping
over his shoulder. The king of the jungle made not the least demonstration
against them.</p>

<p>"That must be 'cause he isn't hungry," remarked Jim.</p>

<p>"Then I should think he would go away and leave us."</p>

<p>"Don't you understand? We're tender, and juicier than that old
man."</p>

<p>"Jingo! if that's what he's after, I'm going to shoot."</p>

<p>Tom again sighted along the barrel; but at the moment his finger
began pressing the trigger, the beast rose to his feet and looked
directly at the house, as if trying to decide the best avenue
of entering,&mdash;the door, the windows, or possibly the chimney.</p>

<p>He formed a striking picture, this fearful king of the jungle,
whose terrific strength, as scientific tests have proven, is one-fifth
greater than that of the African lion. His massive head was erect;
his eyes shone, and his sinewy, graceful body, covered with its
soft, velvety and spotted fur was like the beauty of some deadly
serpent. His long tail slightly swayed from side to side, and,
although the boys could not hear it, they were sure he was growling
in his anger.</p>

<p>Once his blood-red tongue was projected for an instant from his
mouth, and licked his jaws, as the cat species are fond of doing;
and occasionally he moved his head from side to side.</p>

<p>"He means to chaw us all up," said Jim. "Why don't you fire?"</p>

<p>At that instant Tom Gordon pressed the trigger.</p>
