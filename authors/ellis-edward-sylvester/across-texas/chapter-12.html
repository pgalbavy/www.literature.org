<p><em>BEFORE </em>parting with the Texans, Nick Ribsam handed his
field glass to Strubell, with the remark that he and Lattin would
be likely to find it of use, and it could be well spared, since
Herbert had one of his own. The coffee was prepared before the
breaking up took place, for the cooking utensils were to go with
the boys, and the men did not expect to have much leisure for
preparing the delicious refreshment.</p>

<p>The trail, to which several references have been made, showed
no evidence of having been recently travelled, though, in the
course of time, a great many animals must have found their way
through the hills by that route, which Nick took, with the pack
horses stringing after, and Herbert bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>It was too strait to admit of two horsemen riding abreast, and
there were places where there was none too much room for a single
animal. The path wound in and out among and around bowlders and
large rocks, with stunted vegetation here and there, all the time
steadily ascending, until a height of several hundred feet was
attained, beyond which the descent was gradual, until the same
level was reached on the other side.</p>

<p>The distance across the ridge or small mountain spur has been
named—about one-fourth of a mile. It is probable that it was first
made by the feet of wild animals when they were more numerous
in the neighborhood, and was afterward used by Indians and hunters
in passing to and fro through that portion of Texas. It was not
the first time that the speechless part of creation has blazed
the path for the pioneer to follow after them.</p>

<p>Nick Ribsam, having placed himself at the head of the little
party, started his pony, Jack, on a moderate walk, the others
following at the same pace, with Herbert and his Jill at the rear.
They had named their animals that day, and both were surprised
at the intelligence, speed, and endurance they developed. It was
impossible for the boys not to form a fondness for the ponies,
since they were so worthy, and showed a strong affection for their
masters.</p>

<p>The sun was well above the horizon, and the youths had plenty
of time at command. At the highest portion of the path, where
the space was broad enough for a dozen animals to stand side by
side, the boys came together.</p>

<p>"I guess," said Nick, from his saddle to Herbert on his right,
"that you understand what all this means."</p>

<p>"I suspect," replied the elder, "that Strubell and Lattin are
preparing for a fight with Rickard and his men."</p>

<p>"I’ve no doubt that’s it, and they want us out of the way; they
are pretty shrewd fellows, but I can’t help wondering what answer
Strubell would have made, if I had asked him how our absence would
be likely to help him and Lattin better than our presence. Well,
no doubt they have good reason to want us beyond gunshot; we couldn’t
give them any help, and might prove a hindrance, and they think
too much of us to allow us to run into danger when they can prevent
it."</p>

<p>"Nick," said Herbert, as if giving expression to a thought that
had been in his mind for some time; "I wish I could think as you
do about things, but I can’t."</p>

<p>The younger lad looked at him with surprise.</p>

<p>"What’s the odds, if we don’t see everything in exactly the same
light? But I am not sure that I understand you."</p>

<p>"Let’s dismount for a few minutes."</p>

<p>The open space where the four animals were standing was so walled
in by masses and piles of stone and vegetation that, although
considerably higher than their friends at the foot of the ridge,
the latter were invisible. By climbing a large, irregular bowlder,
the Texans were in plain sight.</p>

<p>"Don’t let them see us," said Herbert, "but let’s watch them
for a while: maybe you can explain things, and maybe you can’t."</p>

<p>Nick was a little disturbed by the words of Herbert, though it
should be stated that it was not the mind of either to suspect
the Texans of anything but the truest friendship toward them;
but it looked very much as if something was on foot which they
wished to keep secret from their younger companions.</p>

<p>Strubell and Lattin were standing beside each other, with their
whole attention directed eastward, where Rickard and his companions
were known to be. At the moment the boys observed them, the elder
Texan was holding the field glass levelled, while Lattin was doing
what he could in the way of observation by shading his eyes with
one hand. They were too far off to learn whether any words passed
between the cowboys.</p>

<p>"I don’t notice anything to cause question," remarked Nick, after
viewing the couple for several minutes. "They are simply studying
the horse thieves over yonder, in the hope of finding out something
about their purposes. We have been doing the same thing, off and
on, for a number of hours."</p>

<p>"And you think there will be a fight?"</p>

<p>"It looks that way; it seems to me that Strubell and Lattin are
satisfied that those fellows yonder are bent on stealing our horses,
and that they are likely to hang to us for days and nights, in
the hope of getting a good chance to do so. So our friends have
made up their minds that the best thing is to settle it at once,
and by sending us off they have cleared the deck for action."</p>

<p>"You put it very well," said Herbert, whose admiration of his
companion’s brightness never grew less; "and maybe, since you
have explained some things so well, you will tell us about others."</p>

<p>The youths now took turns in studying the group across the plain.
The sun was out of sight behind the hills to their rear, but the
eastern horizon, being relieved from the glare, was more favorable
than before for observation through the instrument.</p>

<p>The three horses of the rogues were seen to be on their feet,
with their riders standing beside them, as if about to climb into
the saddles. One of the company, evidently Rickard himself, was
several paces in advance of the others, as motionless as a statue,
and evidently staring in turn toward the Texans at the foot of
the ridge.</p>

<p>"It looks to me," said Nick, passing the glass back to Herbert,
"as though he is using a field glass: can it be possible?"</p>

<p>"What is there so wonderful about that? The cowboys may not be
fond of spy glasses, but it would be strange if some of them did
not employ all the help they could get in their business."</p>

<p>Ceasing the conversation for the moment, the boys gave their
whole attention to seeing what they could see.</p>

<p>Lattin, having passed the glass to Strubell, stepped back to
where the fire was beginning to burn low, and threw on a few sticks.
When the ascending smoke increased in volume, he took off his
broad-brimmed hat and waved it in an odd way over the blaze. The
result was that the volume of smoke, instead of ascending vertically,
was broken into what might be called a regular irregularity, the
appearance being peculiar and different from anything the the
youths had ever observed before.</p>

<p>"That’s a signal to the horse thieves," said Herbert, "and I
would give a good deal to know what it means."</p>

<p>"So would I," added Nick, more disturbed by the sight than he
was willing to admit.</p>

<p>It looked as if Herbert was right, but, if so, the singular feature
of the business was that all the signalling seemed to be done
by Strubell and Lattin. Nothing, so far as could be perceived,
was sent in response by Rickard.</p>

<p>If there were actual communication going on between the parties,
it was beyond the power of Nick and Herbert to frame a satisfactory
explanation. Why intercourse should be held at such long range,
when seemingly there was no reason for the mutual playing off,
was a problem beyond ordinary acuteness.</p>

<p>But while the two were speculating, Herbert, with his field glass
to his eye, began sweeping every part of the visible horizon.
He had no special object in doing this, but thought he might perceive
other horsemen, who had nothing to do with their friends or enemies.</p>

<p>Suddenly he startled Nick by an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Follow the direction of my finger!" he said, "and tell me what
you see."</p>

<p>He pointed almost north, that is in a line parallel with the
ridge which they were crossing; and, without the aid of the field
glass, Nick observed a second column of smoke of precisely the
same appearance as that produced by Baker Lattin at the foot of
the hills.</p>

<p>Apparently it was a mile distant, its location being at one corner
of a right-angled triangle, with the horse thieves and Texans
at the other two respective corners. The course of the ridge shut
Strubell and Lattin from the sight of those that were managing
the second fire. The parties could not have caught the first mutual
glimpse, and yet nothing was more reasonable to believe than that
they were telegraphing important messages back and forth to each
other.</p>
