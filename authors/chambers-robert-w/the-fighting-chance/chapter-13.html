<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The heat, which had been severe in June, driving the last fashionable
loiterer into the country, continued fiercely throughout July.
August was stifling; the chestnut leaves in the parks curled up
and grew brittle; the elms were blotched; brown stretches scarred
the lawns; the blazing colour of the geranium beds seemed to intensify
the heat, like a bed of living coals.</p>

<p>Nobody who was anybody remained in town&mdash;except some wealthy
business men and their million odd employés; but the million,
being nobodies, didn't count.</p>

<p>Nobody came into town; that is to say that a million odd strangers
came as usual, swelling the sweltering, resident population sufficiently
to animate the main commercial thoroughfares morning and evening,
but they didn't count; the money they spent was, however, very
carefully counted.</p>

<p>The fashionable columns of the newspapers informed the fashionable
ex-urbanated that the city was empty&mdash;though the East Side reeked
like a cattle-pen, and another million or two gasped on the hot,
tin roofs under the stars, or buried their dirty faces in the
parched park grass.</p>

<p>What the press meant to say was that the wealthy section of the
city within the shadow of St. Patrick's twin white spires and
north of Fifty-ninth Street was as empty and silent as an abandoned
gold-mine. Which was true. Miles of elaborate, untenanted dwellings
glimmered blank under the moon and stood tomb-like in barren magnificence
against the blazing blue of noon. Miles of plate-glass windows,
boarded, or bearing between lowered shade and dusty pane the significant
parti-coloured placard warning the honest thief, stared out at
the heated park or, in the cross streets, confronted each other
with inert hauteur, awaiting the pleasure of their absent owners.</p>

<p>The humidity increased; the horses' heads hung heavily under
their ridiculously pitiful straw bonnets. When the sun was vertical
nobody stirred; when the bluish shadows began to creep out over
baked sidewalks, broadening to a strip of superheated shade, a
few stirred abroad in the deserted streets; here a policeman,
thin blue summer tunic open, helmet in hand, swabbing the sweat
from forehead and neck; there a white uniformed street sweeper
dragging his rubber-edged mop or a section of wet hose; perhaps
a haggard peddler of lemonade making for the Park wall around
the Metropolitan Museum where, a little later, the East Side would
venture out to sit on the benches, or the great electric tourists'
busses would halt to dump out a living cargo&mdash;perhaps only the
bent figure of a woman, very shabby, very old, dragging her ancient
bones along the silent splendour of Fifth Avenue, and peering
about the gutters for something she never finds&mdash;always peering,
always mumbling the endless, wordless, soundless miserere of the
poor.</p>

<p>Quarrier's huge limestone mansion, looming golden in the sun,
was tenantless; its owner, closing even The Sedges, his Long Island
house, and driven northward for a breath of air, was expected
at Shotover.</p>

<p>The house of Mrs. Mortimer was closed and boarded up; the Caithness
mansion was closed; the Ferralls', the Bonnesdels', the Pages',
the Shannons', Mrs. Vendenning's, all were sealed up like vaults.
A caretaker apparently guarded Major Belwether's house, peeping
out at intervals from behind the basement windows. As for Plank's
great pile of masonry, edging the outer Hundreds in the north,
several lighted windows were to be seen in it at night, and a
big yellow and black touring-car whizzed down town from its bronze
gateway every morning with perfect regularity.</p>

<p>For there was a fight on that had steadily grown hotter with
the weather, and Plank had little time to concern himself with
the temperature or to mop his red features over the weather bureau
report. Harrington and Quarrier were after him, horse, foot, and
dragoons; Harrington had even taken a house at Seabright in order
to be near in person; and Quarrier's move from Long Island to
Shotover House was not as flippant as it might appear, for he
had his private car there and a locomotive at Black Fells Crossing
station, and he was within striking distance of Rochester, Utica,
Syracuse, and Albany. Which was what Harrington thought necessary.</p>

<p>The vast unseen machinery set in motion by Harrington and Quarrier
had begun to grind in May; and, at the first audible rumble, the
aspect of things financial in the country changed. A few industrials
began to rocket, nobody knew why; but the market's first tremor
left it baggy and spineless, and the reaction, already overdue,
became a sodden and soggy slump. Nobody knew why.</p>

<p>The noise of the fray in the papers, which had first excited
then stunned the outside public, continued in a delirium of rumour,
report, forecast, and summing up at the week's end.</p>

<p>Scare heads, involving everybody and everything, from the District-Attorney
to Plank's office boy, succeeded one another. Plank's name headed
column after column. Already becoming familiar in the society
and financial sections, it began to appear in neighbouring paragraphs.
Who was Plank? And the papers told people with more or less inaccuracy,
humour, or sarcasm. What was he trying to do? The papers tried
to tell that, too, making a pretty close guess, with comments
good-natured or ill-natured according to circumstances over which
somebody ought to have some control. What was Harrington trying
to do to Plank&mdash;if he was trying to do anything? They told that
pretty clearly. What was Quarrier going to do to Plank? That,
also, they explained in lively detail. A few clergymen who stuck
to their churches began to volunteer pulpit opinions concerning
the ethics of the battle. A minister who was generally supposed
to make an unmitigated nuisance of himself in politics dealt Plank
an unexpected blow by saying that he was a "hero." Some papers
called him "Hero" Plank for awhile, but soon tired of it or forgot
it under the stress of the increasing heat.</p>

<p>Besides Plank scarcely noticed what the press said of him. He
was too busy; his days were full days, brimming over deep into
the night. Brokers, lawyers, sycophants, tipsters, treacherous
ex-employés of Quarrier, detectives, up-State petty officials,
lobbyists from Albany, newspaper men, men from Wall Street, Broad
Street, Mulberry Street, Forty-second Street&mdash;all these he saw
in units, relays, regiments&mdash;either at his offices or after dinner&mdash;and
sometimes after midnight in his own house. And these were only
a few, picked from the interested or disinterested thousands who
besieged him with advice, importunity, threats, and attempted
blackmail. And he handled them all in turn, stolidly but with
decision. His obstinate under lip protruded further and further
with rare recessions; his heavy head was like the lowered head
of a bull. Undaunted, inexorable, slow to the verge of stupidity
at times, at times swift as a startled tiger, this new, amazing
personality steadily developing, looming higher, heavier, athwart
the financial horizon&mdash;in stature holding his own among giants,
then growing, gradually, inch by inch, dominated his surrounding
level sky line.</p>

<p>The youth in him was the tragedy to the old; the sudden silence
of the man the danger to the secretive. Harrington was already
an old man; Quarrier's own weapon had always been secrecy; but
the silence of Plank confused him, for he had never learned to
parry well another's use of his own weapon. The left-handed swordsman
dreads to cross with a man who fights with the left hand. And
Harrington, hoary, seamed, scarred, maimed in onslaughts of long
forgotten battles, looked long and hard upon this weird of his
own dead youth which now rose towering to confront him, menacing
him with the armed point of the same shield behind which he himself
had so long found shelter&mdash;the Law!</p>

<p>The closing of the courts enforced armed truces along certain
lines of Plank's battle front; the adjournment of the legislature
emptied Albany. Once it was rumoured that Plank had passed an
entire morning with the Governor of the greatest State in the
Union and that the conference was to be repeated. A swarm of newspaper
men settled about the Governor's summer cottage at Saratoga, but
they learned nothing, nor could they find a trace of Plank's tracks
in the trodden trails of the great Spa.</p>

<p>Besides, the racing had begun; Desmond, Burbank, Sneed, and others
of the gilded guild had opened new club-houses; the wretched,
half-starved natives in the surrounding hills were violating the
game-laws to distend the paunches of the overfed with five-inch
troutlings and grouse and woodcock slaughtered out of season;
so there was plenty of copy for newspaper men without the daily
speculative paragraph devoted to the doings of Beverly Plank.
Some scandal, too&mdash;but newspapers never touch that; and after
all it was nobody's affair that Leroy Mortimer drove a large yellow
and black Serin-Chanteur touring-car, new model, all over Saratoga
county. Perhaps the similarity of machines gave rise to the rumour
of Plank's presence; perhaps not, because the car was often driven
by a tall, slender girl with dark eyes and hair; and nobody ever
saw that sort of pretty woman in Plank's Serin, or saw Leroy Mortimer
for many days without a companion of that species.</p>

<p>Mortimer's health was excellent. The races had not proved remunerative
however, and his new motor-car was horribly expensive. So was
Lydia. And he began to be seriously afraid that by the end of
August he would be obliged to apply to Quarrier once more for
some slight temporary token of that gentleman's goodwill. He told
Lydia this, and she seemed to agree with him. This pleased him.
She had not pleased him very much recently. For one thing she
was becoming too friendly with some of his friends &mdash;Desmond
in particular.</p>

<p>Plank, it was known, had opened his great house at Black Fells.
His servants, gamekeepers, were there; his stables, kennels, greenhouses,
model stock-farm&mdash;all had been put in immaculate condition pending
the advent of the master. But Plank had not appeared; his new
sea-going steam yacht still lay in the East River, and, at rare
intervals, a significant glimmer of bunting disclosed the owner's
presence aboard for an hour or two. That was all, however; and
the cliff-watchers at Shotover House and the Fells looked seaward
in vain for the big Siwanoa, as yacht after yacht, heralded by
the smudge on the horizon, turned from a gray speck to a white
one, and crept in from the sea to anchor.</p>

<p>The Ferralls were at Shotover with their first instalment of
guests. Sylvia was there, Quarrier expected&mdash;because Kemp Ferrall's
break with him was not a social one, and Grace's real affection
for Sylvia blinded neither her nor her husband to the material
and social importance of the intimacy. Siward was not invited;
neither had an invitation to him been even discussed in view of
what Grace was aware of, and what everybody knew concerning the
implacable relations existing between him, personally, and Howard
Quarrier.</p>

<p>Bridge, yachting, and motoring were the August sports; the shooting
set had not yet arrived, of course; in fact there was still another
relay expected before the season opened and brought the shooting
coterie for the first two weeks. But Sylvia was expected to last
through and hold over with a brief interlude for a week's end
at Lenox. So was Quarrier; and Grace, always animated by a lively
but harmless malice, hoped to Heaven that Plank might arrive before
Quarrier left, because she adored the tension of situations and
was delightedly persuaded that Plank was more than able to hold
his own with her irritating cousin.</p>

<p>"Oh, to see them together in a small room," she sighed ecstatically
in Sylvia's ear; "I'd certainly poke them up if they only turned
around sulkily in the corners of the cage and evinced a desire
to lie down."</p>

<p>"What a mischief-maker you are," said Sylvia listlessly; and
though Grace became very vivacious in describing her plans to
extract amusement out of Plank's hoped-for presence Sylvia remained
uninterested.</p>

<p>There seemed, in fact, little to interest her that summer at
Shotover House; and, though she never refused any plans made for
her, and her attitude was one of quiet acquiescence always&mdash;she
never expressed a preference for anything, a desire to do anything;
and, if let alone, was prone to pace the cliffs or stretch her
slim, rounded body on the sand of some little, sheltered, crescent
beach, apparently content with the thunderous calm of sea and
sky.</p>

<p>Her interest, too, in people had seemingly been extinguished.
Once or twice she did inquire as to Marion's whereabouts, and
learned that Miss Page was fishing in Minnesota somewhere but
would return to Shotover when the shooting opened. Somebody, Captain
Voucher, perhaps, mentioned to somebody in her hearing that Siward
was still in New York. If she heard she made no sign, no inquiry.
The next morning she remained abed with a headache, and Grace
motored to Wendover without her; but Sylvia spent the balance
of the day on the cliffs, and played Bridge with the devil's own
luck till dawn, piling up a score that staggered Mr. Fleetwood,
who had been instructing her in adversary play a day or two before.</p>

<p>The hot month dragged on; Quarrier came; Agatha Caithness arrived
a few days later&mdash;scheme of the Ferralls involving Alderdene!&mdash;but
the Siwanoa did not come, and Plank remained invisible. Leila
Mortimer arrived from Swan's Harbour toward the middle of the
month, offering no information as to the whereabouts of what Major
Belwether delicately designated as her "legitimate." But everybody
knew he was at last to be crossed off and struck clean out, and
the ugly history of the winter, now so impudently corroborated
at Saratoga, gave many a hostess the opportunity long desired.
Mortimer, as far as his own particular circle was concerned, was
down and out; Leila, accepted as a matter of course without him,
remained quietly uncommunicative. If the outward physical change
in her was due to her marital rupture people thought it was well
that it had come in time, for she bloomed like a lovely exotic;
and her silences and enthusiasms, and the fragrant freshness of
her developing attitude toward the world first disconcerted, then
amused, then touched those who had supposed themselves to be so
long a buckler for her foibles and a shield for her caprice.</p>

<p>"Gad," said Alderdene, "she's well rid of him if he's been choking
her this long&mdash;the rank, rotten weed that he is, sapping the life
from her so when she hung over toward another fellow's bush we
thought she was frail in the stem &mdash;God bless us all for
a simpering lot of blatherskites!"</p>

<p>And if, in the corner of the gun-room, there was a man among
them who had ever ventured to hold Leila's smooth little hand,
unrebuked, in days gone by, none the less he knew that Alderdene
spoke truth; and none the less he knew that what witness he might
be called to bear at the end of the end of all must only incriminate
himself and not that young matron who now, before their very eyes,
was budding again, reverting to the esoteric charm of youth reincarnated.</p>

<p>"A suit before a referee would settle him," mused Voucher; "he
hasn't a leg to stand on. Lord! The same cat that tripped up Stephen
Siward!"</p>

<p>Fleetwood's quick eyes glimmered for an instant in Quarrier's
direction. Quarrier was in the billiard-room, out of earshot,
practising balk-line problems with Major Belwether; and Fleetwood
said: "The same cat that tripped up Stephen Siward. Yes. But who
let her loose?"</p>

<p>"It was your dinner; you ought to know," said Voucher bluntly.</p>

<p>"I do know. He brought her"&mdash;nodding toward the billiard-room.</p>

<p>"Belwether?"</p>

<p>"No," yawned Fleetwood.</p>

<p>Somebody said presently: "Isn't he one of the Governors? Oh,
I say, that was rather rough on Siward though."</p>

<p>"Yes, rough. The law of trespass ought to have operated; a man's
liable for the damage done by his own live-stock."</p>

<p>"That's a brutal way of talking," said somebody. And the subject
was closed with the entrance of Agatha in white flannels on her
way to the squash court where she had an appointment with Quarrier.</p>

<p>"A strange girl," said somebody after she had disappeared with
Quarrier.</p>

<p>"That pallor is stunning," said a big, ruddy youth, with sunburn
on his neck and forehead.</p>

<p>"It isn't healthy," said Fleetwood.</p>

<p>"It attracts me," persisted the ruddy young man, voicing naively
that curious truth concerning the attraction that disease so often
exerts on health&mdash;the strange curiosity the normal has for the
sub-normal&mdash;that fascination of the wholesome for the unhealthy.
It is, perhaps, more curiosity than anything, unless, deep hidden
under the normal, there lie one single, perverted nerve.</p>

<p>Sylvia, passing the hall, glanced in through the gun-room door
with an absentminded smile at the men and their laughing greeting,
as they rose with uplifted glasses to salute her.</p>

<p>"The sweetest of all," observed a man, disconsolately emptying
his glass. "Oh irony! What a marriage!"</p>

<p>"Do you know any girl who would not change places with her?"
asked another.</p>

<p>Every man there insisted that he knew one girl at least who would
not exchange Sylvia's future for her own. That was very nice of
them; it is to be hoped they believed it. Some of them did&mdash;for
the moment, anyhow. Then Alderdene, blinking furiously, emitted
one of his ear-racking laughs; and everybody, as usual, laughed
too.</p>

<p>"You damned cynic," observed Voucher affectionately.</p>

<p>"Somebody," said Fleetwood, "insists that she doubled up poor
Siward."</p>

<p>"She never met Siward until she was engaged to Howard," remarked
Voucher.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you consider that enough to squelch the story?"</p>

<p>"Engaged girls," mused Alderdene, "never double up except at
Bridge."</p>

<p>"Everybody has been or is in love with Sylvia Landis," said Voucher,
"and it's a man's own fault if he's hit. Once she did it, innocently
enough, and enjoyed it, never realising that it hurt a man to
be doubled up."</p>

<p>Fleetwood yawned again and said: "She can have me to-morrow.
But she won't. She's tired of the sport. Any girl would get enough
with the pack at her heels day in and day out. Besides she's done
for&mdash;unless she looses Quarrier and starts on a duke-hunt over
in Blinky's country! … Is anybody on for a sail? Is anybody on
for anything? No? Oh, very well. Shove that decanter north by
west, Billy."</p>

<p>This was characteristic of the dog-days at Shotover. The dog-days
in town were very different; the city threw open the parks to
the poor at night; horses fell dead in the streets; pallid urchins,
stripped naked, splashed and rolled and screeched in the basin
of the City Hall fountain under the indifferent eyes of the police.</p>

<p>As for Plank he was too busy to know what the thermometer was
about; he had no time for anything outside of his own particular
business except to go every day to the big, darkened house in
lower Fifth Avenue where the days had been hard on Siward and
the nights harder.</p>

<p>Siward, however, could walk now, using his crutches still, but
often stopping to gently test his left foot and see how much weight
he was able to bear on it&mdash;even taking a tentative step or two
without crutch support. He drove when he thought it prudent to
use the horses in the heat, usually very early in the morning,
though sometimes at night with Plank when the latter had time
to run his touring-car through the park and out into the Bronx
or Westchester for a breath of air.</p>

<p>But Plank wanted him to go away, get out of the city for his
convalescence, and Siward flatly declined, demanding that Plank
permit him to do his share in the fight against the Inter-County
people.</p>

<p>And Plank, utterly unable to persuade him, and the more hampered
because of his anxiety about Siward&mdash;though that young man did
not know it&mdash;wore himself out providing Siward with such employment
in the matter as would lightly occupy him without doing any good
to the enemy.</p>

<p>So Siward, stripped to his pajamas, pored over reams of typewritten
matter and took his brief walking exercise in the comparative
cool of the evening and drove when he dared use his horses; or,
sitting beside Plank, whizzed northward through the starry darkness
of the suburbs.</p>

<p>When it was that he first began to like Plank very much he could
not exactly remember. He was not, perhaps, aware of how much he
liked him. Plank's unexpected fits of shyness, of formality, often
and often amused him. But there was a subtler feeling under the
unexpressed amusement, and, beneath all, a constantly increasing
sub-stratum of respect. Too, he found himself curiously at ease
with Plank, as with one born to his own caste. And this feeling,
unconscious, but more and more apparent, meant more to Plank than
anything that had ever happened to him. It was a tonic in hours
of doubt, a pleasure in his brief leisure, a pride never to be
hinted at, never to be guessed, never to be dreamed of by any
living soul save Plank alone.</p>

<p>Then, one sultry day toward the last week in August, a certain
judge of a certain court, known among some as "Harrington's judge,"
sent secretly for Plank. And Plank knew that the crisis was over.
But neither Harrington nor Quarrier dreamed of such a thing.</p>

<p>Fear sat heavy on that judge's soul&mdash;the godless, selfish fear
that sends the first coward slinking from the councils of conspiracy
to seek immunity from those slowly grinding millstones that grind
exceeding fine.</p>

<p>Quarrier at Shotover, with his private car and his locomotive
within an hour's drive, strolled with Sylvia on the eve of her
departure for Lenox with Leila Mortimer; then, when their conference
was ended, he returned to Agatha, calmly unconscious of impending
events.</p>

<p>Harrington, at Seabright, paced his veranda, awaiting this same
judge, annoyed as two boats came in without the expected guest.
And never for one instant did he dream that his creature sat closeted
with Plank, tremulous, sallow, nearing the edge of cringing avowal&mdash;only
held back from utter collapse by the agonising necessity of completing
a bargain that might save himself from the degradation of the
punishment that had seemed inevitable. All day long he sat with
Plank. Nobody except those two knew he was there. And after a
very long time Plank consented that nobody else except Siward
and Harrington and Quarrier should ever know. So he called up
Harrington on the telephone, saying that there was, in the office,
somebody who desired to speak to him. And when Harrington caught
the judge's first faint, stammered word he reeled where he stood,
ashen, unbelieving, speechless. The shaking but remorseless voice
went on, dinning horribly in his ear, then ceased, and Plank's
heavy voice sounded the curt coup de grâce.</p>

<p>Harrington was an old man, a very old man, mortally hurt; but
he steadied himself along the wall of his study to the desk and
sank into the chair.</p>

<p>There he sat, feeling the scars of old wounds throbbing, feeling
his age and the tragedy of it, and the new sensation of fear&mdash;fear
of the wraith of his own youth, wearing the mask of Plank, and
menacing him with the menace he had used on others so long ago&mdash;so
very long ago.</p>

<p>After a little while he passed a thin hand over his eyes, over
his gray head, over the mouth that all men watched with fear,
over the shaven jaw now grimly set, but trembling. His hand, too,
shook with palsy as he wrote, painfully picking out the words
and figures of the cipher from his code-book; but he closed his
thin lips and squared his unsteady jaw and wrote his message to
Quarrier:</p>

<p>"It is all up. Plank will take over Inter-County. Come at once."</p>

<p>And that was all there was to be done until he could come into
Plank's camp with arms and banners, a conquered man, cynical of
the mercy he dared not expect and which, in all his life, he had
never, never shown to man, to woman, or to child.</p>

<p>Plank slept the sleep of utter exhaustion that night; the morning
found him haggard but strong, cool in his triumph, serious, stern
faced, almost sad that his work was done, the battle won.</p>

<p>From his own house he telegraphed a curt summons to Harrington
and to Quarrier for a conference in his own office; then, finishing
whatever business his morning mail required, put on his hat and
went to see the one man in the world he was most glad for.</p>

<p>He found him at breakfast, sipping coffee and wrinkling his brows
over the eternal typewritten pages. And Plank's face cleared at
the sight and he sat down, laughing aloud.</p>

<p>"It's all over, Siward," he said. "Harrington knows it; Quarrier
knows it by this time. Their judge crawled in yesterday and threw
himself on our mercy; and the men whose whip he obeyed will be
on their way to surrender by this time. … Well! Haven't you a
word?"</p>

<p>"Many," said Siward slowly; "too many to utter, but not enough
to express what I feel. If you will take two on account, here
they are in one phrase: thank you."</p>

<p>"Debt's cancelled," said Plank, laughing. "Do you want to hear
the details?"</p>

<p>They talked for an hour, and, in the telling, even Plank's stolidity
gave way sufficient to make his heavy voice ring at moments, and
the glimmer of excitement edge his eyes. Yet, in the telling,
he scarcely mentioned himself, never hinted of the personal part&mdash;the
inspiration which was his alone; the brunt of the battle which
centred in him; the tireless vigilance; the loneliness of the
nights when he lay awake, perplexed with doubt and nobody to counsel
him&mdash;because men who wage such wars are lonely men and must work
out their own salvation. No, nobody but his peers could advise
him; and he had thought that his enemy was his peer, until that
enemy surrendered.</p>

<p>The narrative exchanged by Plank in return for Siward's intensely
interested questions was a simple, limpid review of a short but
terrific campaign that only yesterday had threatened to rage through
court after court, year after year. In the sudden shock of the
cessation from battle, Plank himself was a little dazed. Yet he
himself had expected the treason that ended all; he himself had
foreseen it. He had counted on it as a good general counts on
such things, confidently, but with a dozen plans as substitutes
in case that plan failed&mdash;each plan as elaborately worked out
to the last detail as though it alone existed as the only hope
of victory. But if Siward suspected something of this it was not
from Plank that he learned it.</p>

<p>"Plank," he said at last, "there is nothing in the world that
men admire more than a man. It is a good deal of a privilege for
me to tell you so."</p>

<p>Plank turned red with surprise and embarrassment, stammering
out something incoherent.</p>

<p>That was all that was said about the victory. Siward, unusually
gay for awhile, presently turned sombre; and it was Plank's turn
to lift him out of it by careless remarks about his rapid convalescence,
and the chance for vacation he so much needed.</p>

<p>Once Siward looked up vacantly: "Where am I to go?" he asked.
"I'd as soon stay here."</p>

<p>"But I'm going," insisted Plank. "The Fells is all ready for
us."</p>

<p>"The Fells! I can't go there!"</p>

<p>"W-what?" faltered Plank, looking at Siward with hurt eyes.</p>

<p>"Can't you&mdash;don't you understand?" said Siward in a low voice.</p>

<p>"No. You once promised&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Plank, I'll go anywhere except there with you. I'd rather be
with you than with anybody. Can I say more than that?"</p>

<p>"I think you ought to, Siward. <em>A&mdash;</em>a fellow feels the
refusal of his offered roof-tree."</p>

<p>"Man! man! it isn't your roof I am refusing. I want to go; I'd
give anything to go. If it were anywhere except where it is, I'd
go fast enough. Now do you understand? If&mdash;if Shotover House and
Shotover people were not next door to the Fells, I'd go. Now do
you understand?"</p>

<p>Plank said: "I don't know whether I understand. If you mean Quarrier,
he's on his way here, and he'll have business to keep him here
for the next few months, I assure you. But"&mdash;he looked very gravely
across at Siward&mdash;"if you don't mean Quarrier&mdash;" He hesitated,
ill at ease under the expressionless scrutiny of the other.</p>

<p>"Do you know what's the matter with me, Plank?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"I have wondered. I wonder now how much you know."</p>

<p>"Very little, Siward."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>Plank looked up, hesitated, and shook his head: "One infers from
what one hears."</p>

<p>"Infers what?"</p>

<p>"The truth, I suppose," replied Plank simply.</p>

<p>"And what," insisted Siward, "have you inferred that you believe
to be the truth? Don't parry, Plank; it isn't easy for me, and
I &mdash;I never before spoke this way to any man. … It is likely
I should have spoken to my mother about it. … I had expected to.
It may be weakness &mdash;I don't know; but I'd like to talk a
little about it to somebody. And there's nobody fit to listen,
except you."</p>

<p>"If you feel that way," said Plank slowly, "I will be very glad
to listen."</p>

<p>"I feel that way. I've been through&mdash;some things; I've been pretty
sick, Plank. It tires a man out; a man's head and shoulders get
tired. Oh, I don't mean the usual reaction from self-contempt,
disgust&mdash;the dreadful, aching sadness of it all which lasts even
while desire, stunned for the moment, wakens into craving. I don't
mean that. It is something else&mdash;a deathly, mental solitude that
terrifies. I tell you, no man except a man smitten by my malady
knows what solitude can be! … There! I didn't mean to be theatrical;
I had no intention of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on," cut in Plank heavily.</p>

<p>"Go on! … Yes, I want to. You know what a pillow is to a tired
man's shoulders. I want to use your sane intelligence to rest
on a moment. It's my brain that's tired, Plank."</p>

<p>Although everybody had cynically used Plank, nobody had ever
before found him a necessity.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said unsteadily. "If I can be of use to you, Siward,
in God's name let me be, for I have never been necessary to anybody
in all my life."</p>

<p>Siward rested his head on one clinched hand: "How much chance
do you think I have?" he asked wearily.</p>

<p>"Chance to get well?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Plank considered for a moment, then: "You are not trying, Siward."</p>

<p>"I have been trying since&mdash;since March."</p>

<p>"Since March?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Plank looked at him curiously: "What happened in March?"</p>

<p>"Had I better tell you?"</p>

<p>"You know better than I."</p>

<p>Siward, cheek crushed against his fist, his elbow on the desk,
gazed at him steadily:</p>

<p>"In March," he said, "Miss Landis spoke to me. I've made a better
fight since."</p>

<p>Plank's serious face darkened. "Is she the only anchor you have?"</p>

<p>"Plank, I am not even sure of her. I have made a better fight
since then; that is all I dare say. I know what men think about
a man like me; I knew they demand character, pride, self-denial.
But, Plank, I am driving faster and faster toward the breakers,
and these anchors are dragging. For it is not, in my case, the
physical failure to obey the will; it is the will itself that
has been attacked from the first. That is the horror of it. And
what is there behind the will-power to strengthen it? Only the
source of will-power&mdash;the mind. It is the mind that cannot help
me. What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"There is a spiritual strength," said Plank timidly.</p>

<p>"I have never dreamed of denying it," said Siward. "I have tried
to find it through the accepted sources&mdash;accepted by me, too.
God has not helped me in the conventional way or through traditional
methods; but that has not inclined me to doubt Him as the tribunal
of last resort," he added hastily. "I don't for a moment waver
in faith because I am ignorant of the proper manner to approach
Him. The Arbiter of all knows that I desire to be decent. He must
be aware, too, that all anchors save one have failed to hold me."</p>

<p>"You mean &mdash;Miss Landis?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It may be weakness; it may be to my shame that the cables
of pride and self-respect, even the spiritual respect for the
Highest, cannot hold me when this one anchor holds. All I know
is that it holds&mdash;so far. It held me at Shotover; it holds me
again, now. And the rocks were close abeam, Plank&mdash;very close&mdash;when
she spoke to me over the wires, through the rain, that dark day
in March."</p>

<p>He moistened his lips feverishly.</p>

<p>"She said that I might see her. I have waited a long time. I
have taken my fighting chance again and I've won out, so far."</p>

<p>He looked up at Plank, curiously embarrassed:</p>

<p>"Your body is normal; your intelligence wholesome, balanced,
sane; and I want to ask you if you think that perhaps, without
understanding how, I have found in her, or through her, in some
way, the spiritual source that I think might help me to help myself?"</p>

<p>And, as Plank made no reply:</p>

<p>"Or am I talking sentimental cant? Don't answer, if you think
that. I can't trust my own mind any more, anyway; and," with an
ugly laugh, "I'll know it all some day&mdash;the sooner the better!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that!" growled Plank. "You were sane a moment ago."</p>

<p>Siward looked up sharply, but the other silenced him with a gesture.</p>

<p>"Wait! You asked me a perfectly sane question&mdash;so wholesome,
so normal, that I'm trying to frame an answer worthy of it! I
intimated that after the physical, the mental, the ethical phenomena,
there remained always the spiritual instinct. Like a wireless
current, if a man can establish communication it is well for him,
whatever the method. You assented, I think."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you ask me if I believe it possible that she can be the
medium?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Plank said deliberately: "Yes, I do think so."</p>

<p>The silence was again broken by Plank: "Siward, you have asked
me what I think. Now you must listen to the end. If you believed
that through her&mdash;her love, marrying her&mdash;you stood the best chance
in the world to win out, it would be cowardly to ask her to take
the risk. As much as I care for you I had rather see you lose
the fight than accept such a risk from her. Now you know what
I think&mdash;but you don't know all. Siward, I say to you that if
you are man enough to take her, take her! And I say that of the
two risks she is running to-day, the chance she might take with
you is infinitely the lesser risk. For with you, if you continue
slowly losing your fight, the mental suffering only will be hers.
But if she closes this bargain with Quarrier, selling to him her
body, the light will go out of her soul for ever."</p>

<p>He leaned heavily toward Siward, stretching out his powerful
arm:</p>

<p>"You marry her; and keep open your spiritual communication through
her, if that is the way it has been established, and hang on to
your God that way until your body is dead! I tell you, Siward,
to marry her. I don't care how you do it; I don't care how you
get her. Take her! Yours, of the two, is the stronger character,
or she would not be where she is. Does she want what you cannot
give her? Cure that desire&mdash;it is more contemptible than the craving
that shatters you! I say, let the one-eyed lead the blind. Miracles
are worked out by mathematics&mdash;if you have faith enough."</p>

<p>He rose, striding the length of the room once or twice, turned,
holding out his broad hand:</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said. "Harrington is about due at my office; Quarrier
will probably turn up to-night. I am not vindictive; I shall be
just with them&mdash;as just as I know how, which is to be as merciful
as I dare be. Good-bye, Siward. I &mdash;I believe you and she
are going to get well."</p>

<p>When he had gone, Siward lay back in his chair, very still, eyes
closed. A faint colour had mounted to his face and remained there.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when he went down-stairs, using
his crutches lightly. Gumble handed him a straw hat and opened
the door, and Siward cautiously descended the stoop, stood for
a few moments on the sidewalk, looking up at the blue sky, then
wheeled and slowly made his way toward Washington Square. The
avenue was deserted; his own house appeared to be the only remaining
house still open in all that old-fashioned but respectable quarter.</p>

<p>He swung leisurely southward, a slim, well-built young fellow,
strangely out of place on crutches. The poor always looked at
him; beggars never importuned him, yet found him agreeable to
watch. Children, who seldom look up into the air far enough to
notice grown people, always became conscious of him when he passed;
often smiled, sometimes spoke. As for stray curs and tramp cats,
they were for ever making advances. As long as he could remember,
there was scarcely a week in town but some homeless dog attached
himself to Siward's heels, sometimes trotting several blocks,
sometimes following him home&mdash;where the outcast was always cared
for, washed, fed, and ultimately shipped out to the farm, where
scores of these "fresh-air" dogs resided on his bounty and rolled
in luxury on his lawns.</p>

<p>Cats, too, were prone to notice him, rising as he passed to hoist
an interrogative tail and make tentative observations.</p>

<p>In Washington Square, these, and the ragged children, knew him
best of all. The children came from Minetta Lane and the purlieus
south and west of it; the cats from the Mews, which Siward always
thought most appropriate.</p>

<p>And now, as he passed the marble arch and entered the square,
glancing behind him he saw the inevitable cat trotting, and, at
his left, a very dirty little girl pretending to trundle a hoop,
but plainly enough keeping sociable pace with him.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Siward. The cat stopped; the child tossed her clustering
curls, gave him a rapid but fearless sidelong glance, laughed,
and ran on in the wake of her hoop. When she caught it she sat
down on a bench opposite the fountain and looked around at Siward.</p>

<p>"It's pretty warm, isn't it?" said Siward, coming up and seating
himself on the same bench.</p>

<p>"Are you lame?" asked the child.</p>

<p>"Oh, a little."</p>

<p>"Is your leg broken?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not now."</p>

<p>"Is that your cat?"</p>

<p>Siward looked around; the cat was seated on the bench beside
him. But he was accustomed to that sort of thing, and he caressed
the creature with his gloved hand.</p>

<p>"Are you rich?" asked the child, shaking her blond curls from
her eyes and staring up solemnly at him.</p>

<p>"Not very," he answered, smiling. "Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"You look rich, somehow," said the child shyly.</p>

<p>"What! With these old and very faded clothes?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, swinging her plump legs: "You look it, somehow.
It isn't the clothes that matter."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you one thing," said Siward, laughing "I'm rich enough
to buy all the hokey-pokey you can eat!" and he glanced meaningly
at the pedlar of that staple who had taken station between a vender
of peaches and a Greek flower-seller.</p>

<p>The child looked, too, but made no comment.</p>

<p>"How about it?" asked Siward.</p>

<p>"I'd rather have something to remember you by," said the girl
innocently.</p>

<p>"What?" he said, perplexed.</p>

<p>"A rose. They are five cents, and hokey-pokey costs that much
&mdash;I mean, for as much as you can eat."</p>

<p>"Do you really want a rose?" he said amused.</p>

<p>But the child fell shy, and he beckoned the Greek and selected
a dozen big, perfumed jacks.</p>

<p>Then, as the child sat silent, her ragged arms piled with roses,
he asked her jestingly what else she desired.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I like to look at you," she answered simply.</p>

<p>"And I like to look at you. Will you tell me your name?"</p>

<p>"Molly."</p>

<p>But that is all the information he could extract. Presently she
said she was going, hesitated, looked a very earnest good-bye,
and darted away across the park, her hoop over one arm, the crimson
roses bobbing above her shoulders. Something in her flight attracted
the errant cat, for she, too, jumped down and bounded after the
little flying feet, but, catlike, halted half-way to scratch,
and then forgetting what she was about, wandered off toward the
Mews again, whence she had been lured by instinctive fascination.</p>

<p>Siward, intensely amused, sat there in the late sunlight which
streamed through the park, casting long shadows from the elms
and sycamores. It was that time of the day, just before sunset,
when the old square looked to him as he remembered it as a child.
Even the marble arch, pink in the evening sun, did not disturb
the harmony of his memories. He saw his father once more, walking
home from down town, tall, slim, laughingly stopping to watch
him as he played there with the other children&mdash;the nurses, seated
in a row, crocheting under the sycamores; he saw the old-fashioned
carriage pass, Mockett on the box, Wands beside him, and his pretty
mother leaning forward to wave her hand to him as the long-tailed,
long-maned horses wheeled into Fifth Avenue. Little unimportant
scenes, trivial episodes, grew in the spectral garden of memory:
the first time he ever saw Marion Page, when, aged five, she was
attempting to get into the fountain, pursued by a shrieking nurse;
and a certain flight across the grass he had indulged in with
Leila Mortimer, then Leila Egerton, aged six, in hot pursuit,
because she found that it bored him horribly to be kissed, and
she was bound to do it. He had a fight once, over by that gnarled,
old, silver poplar-tree, with Kemp Ferrall&mdash;he could not remember
what about, only that they ended by unanimously assaulting their
nurses and were dragged howling homeward.</p>

<p>He turned, looking across to where the gray towers of the University
once stood. There had been an old stone church there, too; and,
south of that, old, old houses with hip-roofs and dormers where
now the high white cliffs of modern architecture rose, riddled
with tiny windows, every vane glittering in the sun. South, the
old houses still remained, now degraded to sordid uses. North,
the square, red-brick mansions, with their white pillars and steps,
still faced the sunset&mdash;the last practically unbroken rank of
the old régime, the last of the old guard, standing fast and still
confronting, still resisting the Inevitable looming in limestone
and granite, story piled on story, aloft in the kindling, southern
sky.</p>

<p>A cab, driven smartly, passed through the park, the horses' feet
slapping the asphalt till the echoes rattled back from the marble
arch. He followed it idly with his eyes up Fifth Avenue; saw it
suddenly halt in the middle of the street; saw a woman spring
out, stand for a moment talking to her companion, then turn and
look toward the square.</p>

<p>She stood so long, and she was so far away, that he presently
grew tired of watching her. A dozen ragged urchins were prowling
around the fountain, casting sidelong glances at a distant policeman.
But it was not hot enough that evening to permit the children
to splash in the water, and the policeman drove them off.</p>

<p>"Poor little devils!" said Siward to himself; and he rose, adjusted
his crutches, and started through the park with a vague idea of
seeing what could be done.</p>

<p>As he limped onward, the sun level in his eyes, he heard somebody
speak behind him, but did not catch the words or apply the hail
to himself. Then, "Mr. Siward!" came the low, breathless voice
at his elbow.</p>

<p>His heart stopped as he did. The sun had dazzled his eyes, and
when he turned on his crutches he could not see clearly for a
second. That past, he looked at Sylvia, looked at her outstretched
hand, took it mechanically, still staring at her with only a dazed
unbelief in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I am in town for a day," she said. "Leila Mortimer and I were
driving up town from the bank when we saw you; and the next thing
that happened was me, on Fifth Avenue, running after you&mdash;no,
the next thing was my flying leap from the hansom, and my standing
there looking down the street and across the square where you
sat. Then Leila told me I was probably crazy, and I immediately
confirmed her diagnosis by running after you!"</p>

<p>She stood laughing, flushed, sunburned, and breathless, her left
hand still in his, her right hand laid over it.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, with a sudden change to anxiety, "does it tire
you to stand?"</p>

<p>"No. I was going to saunter along."</p>

<p>"May I saunter with you for a moment? I mean &mdash;I only mean,
I am glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Do you think I am going to let you go now?" he asked, astonished.</p>

<p>She looked at him, then her eyes evaded his: "Let us walk a little,"
she said, withdrawing her hand, "if you think you are strong enough."</p>

<p>"Strong! Look, Sylvia!" and he stood unsupported by his crutches,
then walked a little way, slowly, but quite firmly. "I am rather
a coward about my foot, that is all. I shall not lug these things
about after to-day."</p>

<p>"Did the doctor say you might?"</p>

<p>"Yes, after to-day. I could walk home now without them. I could
do a good many things I couldn't do a few minutes ago. Isn't that
curious?"</p>

<p>"Very," she said, avoiding his eyes.</p>

<p>He laughed. She dared not look at him. The excitement and impetus
of sheer impulse had carried her this far; now all the sadness
of it was clutching hard at her throat and for awhile she could
not speak&mdash;walking there in her dainty, summer gown beside him,
the very incarnation of youth and health, with the sea-tan on
wrist and throat, and he, white, hollow-eyed, crippled, limping,
at her elbow!</p>

<p>Yet at that very moment his whole frame seemed to glow and his
heart clamour with the courage in it, for he was thinking of Plank's
words and he knew Plank had spoken the truth. She could not give
herself to Quarrier, if he stood firm. His was the stronger will
after all; his was the right to interfere, to stop her, to check
her, to take her, draw her back&mdash;as he had once drawn her from
the fascination of destruction when she had swayed out too far
over the cliffs at Shotover.</p>

<p>"Do you remember that?" he asked, and spoke of the incident.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember," she replied, smiling.</p>

<p>"Doctors say" he continued, "that there is a weak streak in people
who are affected by great heights, or who find a dizzy fascination
drawing them toward the brink of precipices."</p>

<p>"Do you mean me?" she asked, amused.</p>

<p>But he continued serenely: "You have seen those pigeons called
'tumbler pigeons' suddenly turn a cart-wheel in mid-air? Scientists
say it's not for pleasure they do it; it's because they get dizzy.
In other words, they are not perfectly normal."</p>

<p>She said, laughing: "Well, you never saw me turn a cart-wheel!"</p>

<p>"Only a moral one," he replied airily.</p>

<p>"Stephen, what on earth do you mean? You're not going to be disagreeable,
are you?"</p>

<p>"I am going to be so agreeable," he said, laughing, "that you
will find it very difficult to tear yourself away."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it, but I must, and very soon."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to let you."</p>

<p>"It can't be helped," she said, looking up at him. "I came in
with Leila. We're asked to Lenox for the week's end. We go to
Stockbridge on the early train to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>"I don't care," he said doggedly; "I'm not going to let you go
yet."</p>

<p>"If I took to my heels here in the park would you chase me, Stephen?" 
she asked with mock anxiety.</p>

<p>"Yes; and if I couldn't run fast enough I'd call that policeman.
Now do you begin to understand?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've always understood that you were spoiled. I'm partly
guilty of the spoiling process, too. Listen: I'll walk with you
a little way"&mdash;she looked at him&mdash;"a little way," she continued
gently; "then I must go. There is only a caretaker in our house
and Leila will be furious if I leave her all alone. Besides, we're
going to dine there and it won't be very gay if I don't give a
few orders first."</p>

<p>"But you brought your maid?"</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"Then telephone her that you and Leila are dining out."</p>

<p>"Where, silly? Do you want us to dine somewhere with you?"</p>

<p>"Want you! You've got to!"</p>

<p>"Stephen, it isn't best."</p>

<p>"It is best."</p>

<p>She turned to him impulsively: "Oh, I do want to so much! Do
you think I might? It is perfectly delicious to see you again.
<em>I&mdash;</em>you have no idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," he said sternly.</p>

<p>They turned, walking past the fountain toward Fifth Avenue again.
Furtively she glanced at his hands with the city pallor on them
as they grasped the cross-bars of the crutches, then looked up
at his worn face. He was much thinner, but now in the softly fading
light the shadows under the eyes and cheek-bones seemed less sharp,
his face fuller and more boyish; the contour of head and shoulders,
the short, crisp hair were as she remembered&mdash;and the old charm
held her, the old fascination grew, tightening her throat, stealing
through every vein, stirring her pulses, awakening imperceptibly
once more the best in her. The twilight of a thousand years seemed
to slip from the world as she looked out at it through eyes opening
from a long, long sleep; the marble arch burned rosy in the evening
glow; a fairy haze hung over the enchanted avenue, stretching
away, away into the blue magic of the city of dreams.</p>

<p>"There is no use," she said under her breath; "I can't go back
to Leila. Stephen, the dreadful part of it is that I &mdash;I
wish she were in Jericho! I wish the whole world were in Ballyhoo,
and you and I alone once more!"</p>

<p>Under their gay laughter quivered the undertone of excitement.
Sylvia said:</p>

<p>"I'd like to talk to you all alone. It won't do, of course; but
I may say what I'd like&mdash;mayn't I? What time is it? If I'm dining
with you we've got to have Leila for convention's sake, if not
from motives of sheer decency, which you and I seem to lack, Stephen."</p>

<p>"We lack decency," said Siward, "and we're proud of it. As for
Leila, I am going to arrange for her very simply but very beautifully.
Plank will take care of her. Sylvia! There's not a soul in town
and we can be as imprudent as we please."</p>

<p>"No, we can't. Agatha's at the Santa Regina. She came down with
us."</p>

<p>"But we are not going to dine at the Santa Regina. We're going
where Agatha wouldn't intrude her colourless nose&mdash;to a thoroughly
unfashionable and selectly common resort overlooking the classic
Harlem; and we're going to whiz thither in Plank's car, and remain
thither until you yawn for mercy, whence we will return thence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stephen, you silly! I'm perfectly mad to go with you!"</p>

<p>"You'll be madder when you get there, if the table has not improved."</p>

<p>"Table! As though tables mattered on a night like this!" Then
with sudden self-reproach and quick solicitude: "Am I making you
walk too far? Wouldn't you like to go in now?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not tired; I'm millions of years younger, and I'm as
strong as the nine gods of your friend Porsena. Besides, haven't
I waited for this?" and under his breath, fiercely, "Haven't I
waited!" he repeated, turning on her.</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;do you mean that as a reproach?" she asked, lowering her
eyes.</p>

<p>"No. I knew you would not come on 'the first sunny day.'"</p>

<p>"Why did you think I would not come? Did you know me for the
coward I am?"</p>

<p>"I did not think you would come," he repeated, halting to rest
on his crutches. He stood, balanced, staring dreamily into the
dim perspective; and again her fascinated eyes ventured to rest
on the worn, white face, listless, sombre in its fixedness.</p>

<p>The tears were very near her eyes; the spasm in her throat checked
speech. At length she stammered: "I did not come b-because I simply
couldn't stand it!"</p>

<p>His face cleared as he turned quietly: "Child, you must not confuse
matters. You must not think of being sorry for me. The old order
is passing&mdash;ticking away on every clock in the world. All that
inverted order of things is being reversed. You don't know what
I mean, do you? Ah, well; you will know when I grow into something
of what you think you remember in me, and when I grow out of what
I really was."</p>

<p>"Truly I don't understand, Stephen. But then &mdash;I am out
of training since you went&mdash;went out of things. Have I changed?
Do I seem more dull? <em>I&mdash;</em>it has not been very gay with
me. I don't see&mdash;looking back across all the noise, all the chaos
of the winter &mdash;I do not see how I stood it alone."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"N-not seeing you&mdash;sometimes."</p>

<p>He looked at her with smiling, sceptical eyes. "Didn't you enjoy
the winter?"</p>

<p>"Do you enjoy being drugged with champagne?"</p>

<p>His face altered so quickly that, confused, she only stared at
him, the fixed smile stamped on her lips; then, overwhelmed in
the revelation:</p>

<p>"Stephen, surely, surely you know what I meant! I did not mean
that! Dear, do you dream for one moment that&mdash;that I could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. You have not hurt me. Besides, I know what you mean."</p>

<p>After a moment he swung forward on his crutches, biting his lip,
the frown gathering between his temples.</p>

<p>They were passing the big, old-fashioned hotel with its white
façade and green blinds, a lingering landmark of the older city.</p>

<p>"We'll telephone here," he said.</p>

<p>Side by side they went up the great, broad stoop and entered
the lobby.</p>

<p>"If you'll speak to Leila, I'll get Plank on the wire. Say that
we'll stop for you at seven."</p>

<p>She gave her number; then, at the nod of the operator, entered
a small booth. Siward was given another booth in a few moments.</p>

<p>Plank answered from his office; his voice sounded grave and tired
but it quickened, tinged with surprise, when Siward made known
his plan for the evening.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Mortimer in town?" he demanded. "I had a wire from her
that she expected to be here and I hoped to see her at the station
to-morrow on her way to Lenox."</p>

<p>"She's stopping with Miss Landis. Can't you manage to come?"
asked Siward anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Do you wish it particularly? I have just seen
Quarrier and Harrington. I can't quite understand Quarrier's attitude.
There's a certain hint of defiance about it. Harrington is all
caved in. He is ready to thank us for any mercies. But Quarrier&mdash;there's
something I don't fancy, don't exactly understand about his attitude.
He's like a dangerous man whom you've searched for concealed weapons,
and who knows you've overlooked the knife up his sleeve. That's
why I've expected to spend a quiet evening, studying up the matter
and examining every loophole."</p>

<p>"You've got to dine somewhere," said Siward. "If you could fix
it to dine with us &mdash;But I won't urge you."</p>

<p>"All right. I don't know why I shouldn't. I don't know why I
feel this way about things. I &mdash;I rather felt&mdash;you'll laugh,
Siward!&mdash;that somehow I'd better not go out of my own house to-night;
that I was safer, better off in my own house, studying this Quarrier
matter out. I'm tired, I suppose; and this man Quarrier has come
close to worrying me. But it's all right, of course, if you wish
it. You know I haven't any nerves."</p>

<p>"If you are tired&mdash;" began Siward.</p>

<p>"No, no, I'm not. I'll go. Will you say that we'll stop for them
at seven? Really, it's all right, Siward."</p>

<p>"I don't want to urge you," repeated Siward.</p>

<p>"You're not. I'll go. But&mdash;wait one moment tell me, did Quarrier
know that Mrs. Mortimer was to stop with Miss Landis?"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment. Hold the wire."</p>

<p>He opened the door of the booth and saw Sylvia waiting for him,
seated by the operator's desk. She rose at once when she saw he
wished to speak with her.</p>

<p>"Tell me something," he said in a low voice; "did Mr. Quarrier
know that Leila was to stay overnight with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered quietly, surprised. "Why?"</p>

<p>Siward nodded vaguely, closed the door again, and said to Plank:</p>

<p>"Yes, Quarrier knows it. Do you think he'll be there to-night?
I don't suppose Miss Landis and Mrs. Mortimer know he is in town."</p>

<p>Plank's troubled voice came back over the wire: "I don't know.
I don't know what to think. I suppose I'm a little, just a trifle,
overworked. Somebody once said that I had one nerve in me somewhere,
and Quarrier's probably found it; that's all."</p>

<p>"If you think it better not to come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll come. I'll stop for you in the motor. Don't worry, old
fellow! And&mdash;take your fighting chance! Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Siward, absorbed in his own thoughts, rose and walked slowly
out of the booth, utterly unconscious that he had left his crutches
leaning upright in the corner. It was only the surprise dawning
into tremulous delight on Sylvia's face that at last arrested
him.</p>

<p>"See what you have done!" he said, laughing through his own surprise.
"I've a mind to leave them there now, and trust to your new cure."</p>

<p>But she was instantly concerned and anxious, and entering the
booth brought out the crutches and forced him to take them.</p>

<p>"No risks now!" she said decisively. "We have too much at stake
this evening. Leila is coming. Isn't it perfectly delightful?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," he said, his eyes full of the old laughing confidence
again; "and the most delightful part of it all is that you don't
know how delightful it is going to be."</p>

<p>"Don't I? Very well. Only I inform you that I mean to be perfectly
happy! And that means that I'm going to do as I please! And that
means&mdash;oh, it may mean anything! What are you laughing at, Stephen?
I know I'm excited. I don't care! What girl wouldn't be? And I
don't know what's ahead of me at all; and I don't want to know
&mdash;I don't care!"</p>

<p>Her reckless, little laugh rang sweetly in the old-fashioned,
deserted hall; her lovely, daring eyes met his undaunted.</p>

<p>"You won't make love to me, will you, Stephen?"</p>

<p>"Will you promise me the same?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, silly! How do I know what I might say to you,
you big, blundering boy, who can't take care of himself? I don't
know at all; I won't promise. I'm likely to do anything to-night&mdash;even
before Leila and Mr. Plank&mdash;when you are with me. Shame on you
for the shameless girl you've educated!" Her voice fell, tremulously,
and for an instant standing there she remembered her education
and his part in it.</p>

<p>The slow colour in his face reflected the pink confusion in hers.</p>

<p>"O tongue! tongue!" she stammered, "I can't hold you in! I can't
curb you, and I can't make you say what you ought to be saying
to that boy. There's trouble coming for somebody; there's trouble
here already! Call me a cab, Stephen, or I'll be dragging you
into that big, old-fashioned parlour and planting you on a chair
and placing myself opposite, to moon over you until somebody puts
us out! There! Now will you call me a hansom? … And I will be
all ready at seven. … And don't dare to keep me waiting one second!
… Come before seven. You don't want to frighten me, do you? Very
well then, at a quarter to seven&mdash;so I shall not be frightened.
And, Stephen, Stephen, we're doing exactly what we ought not to
do. You know it, don't you? So do I. Nothing can stop us, can
it? Good-bye!"</p>
