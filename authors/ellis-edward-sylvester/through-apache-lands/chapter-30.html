<p>The grizzly could not fail to detect the ruse of the boy, and
he countered by moving around to the other side of the fire, so
that he regained his former advantage. The nocturnal visitor had
evidently set his mind upon making his supper upon the little
chap, whose plump, robust appearance must have been a very tempting
bait to him. The latter was reluctant to repeat his maneuver,
as, by doing so, he would be forced to pass so near his foe that
a big paw might reach out and grasp him while on the way.</p>

<p>"I'll have to fight you with fire," he said, as he seized a large
stick, one end of which was blazing.</p>

<p>In the hope that he might give him a greater scare than before,
the lad swung it rapidly around his head until it was fanned into
a roaring flame. While this was going on, he was surrounded, as
it appeared, by a fiery circle, his appearance being such that
the bravest quadruped living could not have been induced to approach
within his reach. Not content with this, Ned assumed the aggressive.
Stooping low, he emitted a wild yell, and repeating this, pointed
the torch forward and toward him, moving it more rapidly and in
a smaller circle, while at the same time he kept slowly advancing
upon him.</p>

<p>No bear could be expected to withstand such a demonstration.
The figure of the yelling urchin, with his head surrounded by
a blazing serpent, must have struck terror to his very inmost
being. Without pausing to do more than to utter a short growl,
he wheeled around and went crashing through the undergrowth as
if under the belief that a battery had been suddenly unmasked
and was about to open upon him. When he had retreated a few rods
he paused to see how matters appeared, when he again beheld the
horrid figure closer than ever and drawing nearer every moment.
It was appalling, and he plunged away at a greater speed than
ever. Ned pursued him until he was fearful of getting so far away
from the camp fire that he would lose it altogether. When he paused
he could hear the bear still tramping off, as if he already felt
the torch blistering his nose. Turning again, the lad ran with
all speed to his "headquarters," where he flung down his torch
and caught up his gun.</p>

<p>"Now I think I've got time to load it," he said, as he began
the operation at once, a little alarmed, however, to discover
that the supply of ammunition furnished him by Tom Hardynge was
growing alarmingly small.</p>

<p>He succeeded in ramming the charge home, and then as he placed
the cap upon the tube, he felt something of the old confidence
that was his when astride the mustang and coursing over the prairie
at a speed which no horse could equal. When first charged upon
by the monster he had fired with such haste that he had no time
to make any aim; now fortified by his camp fire, he meant to improve
upon that. Everything being ready, he looked off into the gloom,
but nothing was to be seen of the creature, nor did the slightest
sound betray his whereabouts.</p>

<p>"He'll be sneaking back pretty soon," said the lad to himself,
who was resolved to remain on the watch.</p>

<p>He was not kept waiting. A minute later he caught the slow crackling
and trampling of some heavy creature through the undergrowth,
and he was confident that his old enemy was close at hand. The
lad sank down upon one knee, so close to the fire that it scorched
him, and awaited his approach. But the grizzly had been so thoroughly
scared that he hadn't entirely recovered from it. When something
like twenty feet away he halted, and evidently began debating
whether it would be prudent to approach.</p>

<p>Chadmund could not make out his figure distinctly, although he
knew precisely where he was; but, by and by, when the head moved
a little, he caught the phosphorescent glitter of the eyes. As
the fire light shone upon the gun-barrel he wanted no better opportunity,
and, supporting the weapon upon one knee, he pointed it straight
at the center&mdash;that is, directly between those glowing orbs, which
remained stationary, as if in waiting for the fatal messenger.
It came the next moment. True to its aim, the tiny sphere of lead
entered the head of the bear at the most vulnerable point, and
the life went out from that huge mass. A rasping growl, a few
spasmodic throes, and it was all over.</p>

<p>Ned was naturally exultant over his exploit, and he reflected
that if matters went on in the same fashion, he could soon lay
claim to being quite a hunter. He had shot an Indian, a buffalo,
and a grizzly bear, besides performing some other exploits not
always accomplished by men.</p>

<p>"I guess the best plan is to load again," he muttered, as he
adopted this precautionary measure. "That isn't the only grizzly
bear in the country."</p>

<p>By this time the fire was running down, and the lad, throwing
some more fuel upon it, seated himself directly in front, prepared
to watch for further visitors. He had scarcely ensconced himself
in this position when his hair fairly rose on end at hearing a
low but distinct, growl, proving that some other unwelcome caller
was about to pay him his respects.</p>

<p>He hurriedly looked in every direction, but could see nothing
to explain the cause of this alarming manifestation. It was so
different from the warning uttered by the grizzly that he knew
it must be some other sort of creature. Holding his rifle ready
for instant use, he glanced hurriedly about him, but, although
the camp fire was throwing out a long stream of light, no sign
of an animal could be detected.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I heard something," he repeated, still wondering and
looking around in search of the cause. "Hello! there it goes again.
It sounds as if it were somewhere up in the air&mdash;it is in the
air!"</p>

<p>The fire had been kindled against the face of a rock. This rock
rose perpendicularly a dozen feet above the ground below, where
the fire was burning, and where the lad was standing. As he looked
up he saw the gaunt figure of a large mountain wolf standing on
the very edge of this, looking down upon him, its lank jaws distended,
its eyes glaring, and its whole appearance that of a ferocious
beast about to leap down upon his head. The suggestion was so
startling, that Ned uttered an exclamation of terror, and leaped
back several feet.</p>

<p>It must be that when a wild beast comes across a boy, he concludes
that even though he carries a gun there is nothing to be feared
from him. The grizzly bear had shown a sublime indifference to
Ned's capacity, and his life had paid the forfeit. And now, although
the mountain wolf must have seen him raise that rifle and point
it as straight as the finger of fate directly at him, he paid
no attention to it whatever; but there he stood, snarling and
growling, and on the very point of leaping.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a short, sharp crack, and it was all over
with the wolf. He must have gathered himself for a leap at that
very moment; for the bullet that bored his brittle skull through
and through did not prevent an outward bound. A faint yelp and
the creature bounded full a dozen feet directly out from the rock,
and, owing to some curious quirp of the muscles, turned a complete
somerset, and would have landed directly upon the head of Ned
if he hadn't sprung to one side as the carcass fell to the ground.</p>

<p>"That settles your case," remarked the boy, with the indifference
of an old hunter. "Now it's time to load up again."</p>

<p>This done he settled himself to watch and listen and play the
part of his own sentinel for the rest of the night. A faint moaning
of the night-wind was all that reached his ears. Once he fancied
he heard the report of a gun far away in the distance, but it
was so faint that he might have been mistaken. Then a cry, somewhat
resembling that made by a panther, was borne on the wind, but
that, too, seemed to come from the mountains that were miles away
to the westward. No sound indicated the presence of any further
danger close at hand. Everything was quiet, and seemingly at rest.</p>
