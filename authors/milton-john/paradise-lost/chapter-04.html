 <BR>
O For that warning voice, which he who saw <BR>
Th' APOCALYPS, heard cry in Heaven aloud, <BR>
Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, <BR>
Came furious down to be reveng'd on men, <BR>
WO TO THE INHABITANTS ON EARTH! that now, <BR>
While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd <BR>
The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd <BR>
Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now <BR>
SATAN, now first inflam'd with rage, came down, <BR>
The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind, <BR>
To wreck on innocent frail man his loss <BR>
Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell: <BR>
Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, <BR>
Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, <BR>
Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth <BR>
Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, <BR>
And like a devillish Engine back recoiles <BR>
Upon himself; horror and doubt distract <BR>
His troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr <BR>
The Hell within him, for within him Hell <BR>
He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell <BR>
One step no more then from himself can fly <BR>
By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair <BR>
That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie <BR>
Of what he was, what is, and what must be <BR>
Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. <BR>
Sometimes towards EDEN which now in his view <BR>
Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, <BR>
Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun, <BR>
Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre: <BR>
Then much revolving, thus in sighs began. <BR>
<BR>
  O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd, <BR>
Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God <BR>
Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs <BR>
Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call, <BR>
But with no friendly voice, and add thy name <BR>
O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams <BR>
That bring to my remembrance from what state <BR>
I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare; <BR>
Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down <BR>
Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King: <BR>
Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return <BR>
From me, whom he created what I was <BR>
In that bright eminence, and with his good <BR>
Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. <BR>
What could be less then to afford him praise, <BR>
The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, <BR>
How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me, <BR>
And wrought but malice; lifted up so high <BR>
I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher <BR>
Would set me highest, and in a moment quit <BR>
The debt immense of endless gratitude, <BR>
So burthensome, still paying, still to ow; <BR>
Forgetful what from him I still receivd, <BR>
And understood not that a grateful mind <BR>
By owing owes not, but still pays, at once <BR>
Indebted and dischargd; what burden then? <BR>
O had his powerful Destiny ordaind <BR>
Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood <BR>
Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd <BR>
Ambition.  Yet why not? som other Power <BR>
As great might have aspir'd, and me though mean <BR>
Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great <BR>
Fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within <BR>
Or from without, to all temptations arm'd. <BR>
Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand? <BR>
Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, <BR>
But Heav'ns free Love dealt equally to all? <BR>
Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate, <BR>
To me alike, it deals eternal woe. <BR>
Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will <BR>
Chose freely what it now so justly rues. <BR>
Me miserable! which way shall I flie <BR>
Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? <BR>
Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell; <BR>
And in the lowest deep a lower deep <BR>
Still threatning to devour me opens wide, <BR>
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n. <BR>
O then at last relent: is there no place <BR>
Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left? <BR>
None left but by submission; and that word <BR>
DISDAIN forbids me, and my dread of shame <BR>
Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd <BR>
With other promises and other vaunts <BR>
Then to submit, boasting I could subdue <BR>
Th' Omnipotent.  Ay me, they little know <BR>
How dearly I abide that boast so vaine, <BR>
Under what torments inwardly I groane; <BR>
While they adore me on the Throne of Hell, <BR>
With Diadem and Scepter high advanc'd <BR>
The lower still I fall, onely Supream <BR>
In miserie; such joy Ambition findes. <BR>
But say I could repent and could obtaine <BR>
By Act of Grace my former state; how soon <BR>
Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay <BR>
What feign'd submission swore: ease would recant <BR>
Vows made in pain, as violent and void. <BR>
For never can true reconcilement grow <BR>
Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep: <BR>
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse <BR>
And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare <BR>
Short intermission bought with double smart. <BR>
This knows my punisher; therefore as farr <BR>
From granting hee, as I from begging peace: <BR>
All hope excluded thus, behold in stead <BR>
Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight, <BR>
Mankind created, and for him this World. <BR>
So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear, <BR>
Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost; <BR>
Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least <BR>
Divided Empire with Heav'ns King I hold <BR>
By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; <BR>
As Man ere long, and this new World shall know. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face <BR>
Thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair, <BR>
Which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid <BR>
Him counterfet, if any eye beheld. <BR>
For heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule <BR>
Are ever cleer.  Whereof hee soon aware, <BR>
Each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme, <BR>
Artificer of fraud; and was the first <BR>
That practisd falshood under saintly shew, <BR>
Deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge: <BR>
Yet not anough had practisd to deceive <BR>
URIEL once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down <BR>
The way he went, and on th' ASSYRIAN mount <BR>
Saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall <BR>
Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce <BR>
He markd and mad demeanour, then alone, <BR>
As he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen. <BR>
So on he fares, and to the border comes <BR>
Of EDEN, where delicious Paradise, <BR>
Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green, <BR>
As with a rural mound the champain head <BR>
Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides <BR>
With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, <BR>
Access deni'd; and over head up grew <BR>
Insuperable highth of loftiest shade, <BR>
Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm, <BR>
A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend <BR>
Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre <BR>
Of stateliest view.  Yet higher then thir tops <BR>
The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung: <BR>
Which to our general Sire gave prospect large <BR>
Into his neather Empire neighbouring round. <BR>
And higher then that Wall a circling row <BR>
Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit, <BR>
Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue <BR>
Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: <BR>
On which the Sun more glad impress'd his beams <BR>
Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow, <BR>
When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd <BR>
That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire <BR>
Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires <BR>
Vernal delight and joy, able to drive <BR>
All sadness but despair: now gentle gales <BR>
Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense <BR>
Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole <BR>
Those balmie spoiles.  As when to them who saile <BR>
Beyond the CAPE OF HOPE, and now are past <BR>
MOZAMBIC, off at Sea North-East windes blow <BR>
SABEAN Odours from the spicie shoare <BR>
Of ARABIE the blest, with such delay <BR>
Well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a League <BR>
Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles. <BR>
So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend <BR>
Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd <BR>
Then ASMODEUS with the fishie fume, <BR>
That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse <BR>
Of TOBITS Son, and with a vengeance sent <BR>
From MEDIA post to AEGYPT, there fast bound. <BR>
<BR>
  Now to th' ascent of that steep savage Hill <BR>
SATAN had journied on, pensive and slow; <BR>
But further way found none, so thick entwin'd, <BR>
As one continu'd brake, the undergrowth <BR>
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext <BR>
All path of Man or Beast that past that way: <BR>
One Gate there onely was, and that look'd East <BR>
On th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw <BR>
Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, <BR>
At one slight bound high overleap'd all bound <BR>
Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within <BR>
Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling Wolfe, <BR>
Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, <BR>
Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve <BR>
In hurdl'd Cotes amid the field secure, <BR>
Leaps o're the fence with ease into the Fould: <BR>
Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash <BR>
Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores, <BR>
Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, <BR>
In at the window climbes, or o're the tiles; <BR>
So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould: <BR>
So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe. <BR>
Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life, <BR>
The middle Tree and highest there that grew, <BR>
Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life <BR>
Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death <BR>
To them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought <BR>
Of that life-giving Plant, but only us'd <BR>
For prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge <BR>
Of immortalitie.  So little knows <BR>
Any, but God alone, to value right <BR>
The good before him, but perverts best things <BR>
To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. <BR>
Beneath him with new wonder now he views <BR>
To all delight of human sense expos'd <BR>
In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more, <BR>
A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise <BR>
Of God the Garden was, by him in the East <BR>
Of EDEN planted; EDEN stretchd her Line <BR>
From AURAN Eastward to the Royal Towrs <BR>
Of great SELEUCIA, built by GRECIAN Kings, <BR>
Or where the Sons of EDEN long before <BR>
Dwelt in TELASSAR: in this pleasant soile <BR>
His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind; <BR>
Out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow <BR>
All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; <BR>
And all amid them stood the Tree of Life, <BR>
High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit <BR>
Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life <BR>
Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by, <BR>
Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill. <BR>
Southward through EDEN went a River large, <BR>
Nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill <BR>
Pass'd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown <BR>
That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais'd <BR>
Upon the rapid current, which through veins <BR>
Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn, <BR>
Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill <BR>
Waterd the Garden; thence united fell <BR>
Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood, <BR>
Which from his darksom passage now appeers, <BR>
And now divided into four main Streams, <BR>
Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme <BR>
And Country whereof here needs no account, <BR>
But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, <BR>
How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks, <BR>
Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold, <BR>
With mazie error under pendant shades <BR>
Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed <BR>
Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art <BR>
In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon <BR>
Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine, <BR>
Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote <BR>
The open field, and where the unpierc't shade <BR>
Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place, <BR>
A happy rural seat of various view; <BR>
Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme, <BR>
Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde <BR>
Hung amiable, HESPERIAN Fables true, <BR>
If true, here onely, and of delicious taste: <BR>
Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks <BR>
Grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd, <BR>
Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap <BR>
Of som irriguous Valley spread her store, <BR>
Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose: <BR>
Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves <BR>
Of coole recess, o're which the mantling Vine <BR>
Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps <BR>
Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall <BR>
Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake, <BR>
That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd, <BR>
Her chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams. <BR>
The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, <BR>
Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune <BR>
The trembling leaves, while Universal PAN <BR>
Knit with the GRACES and the HOURS in dance <BR>
Led on th' Eternal Spring.  Not that faire field <BR>
Of ENNA, where PROSERPIN gathring flours <BR>
Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie DIS <BR>
Was gatherd, which cost CERES all that pain <BR>
To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove <BR>
Of DAPHNE by ORONTES, and th' inspir'd <BR>
CASTALIAN Spring might with this Paradise <BR>
Of EDEN strive; nor that NYSEIAN Ile <BR>
Girt with the River TRITON, where old CHAM, <BR>
Whom Gentiles AMMON call and LIBYAN JOVE, <BR>
Hid AMALTHEA and her Florid Son <BR>
Young BACCHUS from his Stepdame RHEA'S eye; <BR>
Nor where ABASSIN Kings thir issue Guard, <BR>
Mount AMARA, though this by som suppos'd <BR>
True Paradise under the ETHIOP Line <BR>
By NILUS head, enclos'd with shining Rock, <BR>
A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote <BR>
From this ASSYRIAN Garden, where the Fiend <BR>
Saw undelighted all delight, all kind <BR>
Of living Creatures new to sight and strange: <BR>
Two of far nobler shape erect and tall, <BR>
Godlike erect, with native Honour clad <BR>
In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all, <BR>
And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine <BR>
The image of thir glorious Maker shon, <BR>
Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure, <BR>
Severe, but in true filial freedom plac't; <BR>
Whence true autoritie in men; though both <BR>
Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; <BR>
For contemplation hee and valour formd, <BR>
For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace, <BR>
Hee for God only, shee for God in him: <BR>
His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd <BR>
Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks <BR>
Round from his parted forelock manly hung <BR>
Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: <BR>
Shee as a vail down to the slender waste <BR>
Her unadorned golden tresses wore <BR>
Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd <BR>
As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd <BR>
Subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway, <BR>
And by her yeilded, by him best receivd, <BR>
Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride, <BR>
And sweet reluctant amorous delay. <BR>
Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, <BR>
Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame <BR>
Of natures works, honor dishonorable, <BR>
Sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind <BR>
With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, <BR>
And banisht from mans life his happiest life, <BR>
Simplicitie and spotless innocence. <BR>
So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight <BR>
Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill: <BR>
So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair <BR>
That ever since in loves imbraces met, <BR>
ADAM the goodliest man of men since borne <BR>
His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters EVE. <BR>
Under a tuft of shade that on a green <BR>
Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side <BR>
They sat them down, and after no more toil <BR>
Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic'd <BR>
To recommend coole ZEPHYR, and made ease <BR>
More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite <BR>
More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell, <BR>
Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes <BR>
Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline <BR>
On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours: <BR>
The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde <BR>
Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; <BR>
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles <BR>
Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems <BR>
Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League, <BR>
Alone as they.  About them frisking playd <BR>
All Beasts of th' Earth, since wilde, and of all chase <BR>
In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den; <BR>
Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw <BR>
Dandl'd the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards <BR>
Gambold before them, th' unwieldy Elephant <BR>
To make them mirth us'd all his might, &amp; wreathd <BR>
His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly <BR>
Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine <BR>
His breaded train, and of his fatal guile <BR>
Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass <BR>
Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, <BR>
Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun <BR>
Declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer <BR>
To th' Ocean Iles, and in th' ascending Scale <BR>
Of Heav'n the Starrs that usher Evening rose: <BR>
When SATAN still in gaze, as first he stood, <BR>
Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. <BR>
<BR>
  O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, <BR>
Into our room of bliss thus high advanc't <BR>
Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, <BR>
Not Spirits, yet to heav'nly Spirits bright <BR>
Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue <BR>
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines <BR>
In them Divine resemblance, and such grace <BR>
The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. <BR>
Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh <BR>
Your change approaches, when all these delights <BR>
Will vanish and deliver ye to woe, <BR>
More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; <BR>
Happie, but for so happie ill secur'd <BR>
Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav'n <BR>
Ill fenc't for Heav'n to keep out such a foe <BR>
As now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe <BR>
To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne <BR>
Though I unpittied: League with you I seek, <BR>
And mutual amitie so streight, so close, <BR>
That I with you must dwell, or you with me <BR>
Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please <BR>
Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such <BR>
Accept your Makers work; he gave it me, <BR>
Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfould, <BR>
To entertain you two, her widest Gates, <BR>
And send forth all her Kings; there will be room, <BR>
Not like these narrow limits, to receive <BR>
Your numerous ofspring; if no better place, <BR>
Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge <BR>
On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. <BR>
And should I at your harmless innocence <BR>
Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just, <BR>
Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg'd, <BR>
By conquering this new World, compels me now <BR>
To do what else though damnd I should abhorre. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie, <BR>
The Tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds. <BR>
Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree <BR>
Down he alights among the sportful Herd <BR>
Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one, <BR>
Now other, as thir shape servd best his end <BR>
Neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd <BR>
To mark what of thir state he more might learn <BR>
By word or action markt: about them round <BR>
A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare, <BR>
Then as a Tiger, who by chance hath spi'd <BR>
In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play, <BR>
Strait couches close, then rising changes oft <BR>
His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground <BR>
Whence rushing he might surest seise them both <BR>
Grip't in each paw: when ADAM first of men <BR>
To first of women EVE thus moving speech, <BR>
Turnd him all eare to heare new utterance flow. <BR>
<BR>
  Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, <BR>
Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power <BR>
That made us, and for us this ample World <BR>
Be infinitly good, and of his good <BR>
As liberal and free as infinite, <BR>
That rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here <BR>
In all this happiness, who at his hand <BR>
Have nothing merited, nor can performe <BR>
Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires <BR>
From us no other service then to keep <BR>
This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees <BR>
In Paradise that beare delicious fruit <BR>
So various, not to taste that onely Tree <BR>
Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life, <BR>
So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is, <BR>
Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst <BR>
God hath pronounc't it death to taste that Tree, <BR>
The only sign of our obedience left <BR>
Among so many signes of power and rule <BR>
Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv'n <BR>
Over all other Creatures that possesse <BR>
Earth, Aire, and Sea.  Then let us not think hard <BR>
One easie prohibition, who enjoy <BR>
Free leave so large to all things else, and choice <BR>
Unlimited of manifold delights: <BR>
But let us ever praise him, and extoll <BR>
His bountie, following our delightful task <BR>
To prune these growing Plants, &amp; tend these Flours, <BR>
Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus Eve repli'd.  O thou for whom <BR>
And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh, <BR>
And without whom am to no end, my Guide <BR>
And Head, what thou hast said is just and right. <BR>
For wee to him indeed all praises owe, <BR>
And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy <BR>
So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee <BR>
Preeminent by so much odds, while thou <BR>
Like consort to thy self canst no where find. <BR>
That day I oft remember, when from sleep <BR>
I first awak't, and found my self repos'd <BR>
Under a shade on flours, much wondring where <BR>
And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. <BR>
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound <BR>
Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread <BR>
Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd <BR>
Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went <BR>
With unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe <BR>
On the green bank, to look into the cleer <BR>
Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie. <BR>
As I bent down to look, just opposite, <BR>
A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd <BR>
Bending to look on me, I started back, <BR>
It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd, <BR>
Pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks <BR>
Of sympathie and love, there I had fixt <BR>
Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire, <BR>
Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest, <BR>
What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self, <BR>
With thee it came and goes: but follow me, <BR>
And I will bring thee where no shadow staies <BR>
Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee <BR>
Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy <BR>
Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare <BR>
Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd <BR>
Mother of human Race: what could I doe, <BR>
But follow strait, invisibly thus led? <BR>
Till I espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall, <BR>
Under a Platan, yet methought less faire, <BR>
Less winning soft, less amiablie milde, <BR>
Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd, <BR>
Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return fair EVE, <BR>
Whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art, <BR>
His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent <BR>
Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart <BR>
Substantial Life, to have thee by my side <BR>
Henceforth an individual solace dear; <BR>
Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim <BR>
My other half: with that thy gentle hand <BR>
Seisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see <BR>
How beauty is excelld by manly grace <BR>
And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake our general Mother, and with eyes <BR>
Of conjugal attraction unreprov'd, <BR>
And meek surrender, half imbracing leand <BR>
On our first Father, half her swelling Breast <BR>
Naked met his under the flowing Gold <BR>
Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight <BR>
Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms <BR>
Smil'd with superior Love, as JUPITER <BR>
On JUNO smiles, when he impregns the Clouds <BR>
That shed MAY Flowers; and press'd her Matron lip <BR>
With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd <BR>
For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne <BR>
Ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind. <BR>
<BR>
  Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two <BR>
Imparadis't in one anothers arms <BR>
The happier EDEN, shall enjoy thir fill <BR>
Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust, <BR>
Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, <BR>
Among our other torments not the least, <BR>
Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines; <BR>
Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd <BR>
From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: <BR>
One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call'd, <BR>
Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd'n? <BR>
Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should thir Lord <BR>
Envie them that? can it be sin to know, <BR>
Can it be death? and do they onely stand <BR>
By Ignorance, is that thir happie state, <BR>
The proof of thir obedience and thir faith? <BR>
O fair foundation laid whereon to build <BR>
Thir ruine!  Hence I will excite thir minds <BR>
With more desire to know, and to reject <BR>
Envious commands, invented with designe <BR>
To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt <BR>
Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such, <BR>
They taste and die: what likelier can ensue? <BR>
But first with narrow search I must walk round <BR>
This Garden, and no corner leave unspi'd; <BR>
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet <BR>
Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n, by Fountain side, <BR>
Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw <BR>
What further would be learnt.  Live while ye may, <BR>
Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return, <BR>
Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. <BR>
<BR>
  So saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd, <BR>
But with sly circumspection, and began <BR>
Through wood, through waste, o're hil, o're dale his roam. <BR>
Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav'n <BR>
With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun <BR>
Slowly descended, and with right aspect <BR>
Against the eastern Gate of Paradise <BR>
Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock <BR>
Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds, <BR>
Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent <BR>
Accessible from Earth, one entrance high; <BR>
The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung <BR>
Still as it rose, impossible to climbe. <BR>
Betwixt these rockie Pillars GABRIEL sat <BR>
Chief of th' Angelic Guards, awaiting night; <BR>
About him exercis'd Heroic Games <BR>
Th' unarmed Youth of Heav'n, but nigh at hand <BR>
Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares <BR>
Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold. <BR>
Thither came URIEL, gliding through the Eeven <BR>
On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr <BR>
In AUTUMN thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd <BR>
Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner <BR>
From what point of his Compass to beware <BR>
Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. <BR>
<BR>
  GABRIEL, to thee thy cours by Lot hath giv'n <BR>
Charge and strict watch that to this happie place <BR>
No evil thing approach or enter in; <BR>
This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare <BR>
A Spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know <BR>
More of th' Almighties works, and chiefly Man <BR>
Gods latest Image: I describ'd his way <BR>
Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate; <BR>
But in the Mount that lies from EDEN North, <BR>
Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks <BR>
Alien from Heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd: <BR>
Mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade <BR>
Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew <BR>
I fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise <BR>
New troubles; him thy care must be to find. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd: <BR>
URIEL, no wonder if thy perfet sight, <BR>
Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst, <BR>
See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass <BR>
The vigilance here plac't, but such as come <BR>
Well known from Heav'n; and since Meridian hour <BR>
No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort, <BR>
So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds <BR>
On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude <BR>
Spiritual substance with corporeal barr. <BR>
But if within the circuit of these walks <BR>
In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom <BR>
Thou telst, by morrow dawning I shall know. <BR>
<BR>
  So promis'd hee, and URIEL to his charge <BR>
Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd <BR>
Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall'n <BR>
Beneath th' AZORES; whither the prime Orb, <BR>
Incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd <BR>
Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth <BR>
By shorter flight to th' East, had left him there <BR>
Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold <BR>
The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend: <BR>
Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray <BR>
Had in her sober Liverie all things clad; <BR>
Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird, <BR>
They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests <BR>
Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale; <BR>
She all night long her amorous descant sung; <BR>
Silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the Firmament <BR>
With living Saphirs: HESPERUS that led <BR>
The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon <BR>
Rising in clouded Majestie, at length <BR>
Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light, <BR>
And o're the dark her Silver Mantle threw. <BR>
<BR>
  When ADAM thus to EVE: Fair Consort, th' hour <BR>
Of night, and all things now retir'd to rest <BR>
Mind us of like repose, since God hath set <BR>
Labour and rest, as day and night to men <BR>
Successive, and the timely dew of sleep <BR>
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines <BR>
Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long <BR>
Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; <BR>
Man hath his daily work of body or mind <BR>
Appointed, which declares his Dignitie, <BR>
And the regard of Heav'n on all his waies; <BR>
While other Animals unactive range, <BR>
And of thir doings God takes no account. <BR>
Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East <BR>
With first approach of light, we must be ris'n, <BR>
And at our pleasant labour, to reform <BR>
Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green, <BR>
Our walks at noon, with branches overgrown, <BR>
That mock our scant manuring, and require <BR>
More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: <BR>
Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms, <BR>
That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, <BR>
Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; <BR>
Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus EVE with perfet beauty adornd. <BR>
My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst <BR>
Unargu'd I obey; so God ordains, <BR>
God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more <BR>
Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. <BR>
With thee conversing I forget all time, <BR>
All seasons and thir change, all please alike. <BR>
Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, <BR>
With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun <BR>
When first on this delightful Land he spreads <BR>
His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, <BR>
Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth <BR>
After soft showers; and sweet the coming on <BR>
Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night <BR>
With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon, <BR>
And these the Gemms of Heav'n, her starrie train: <BR>
But neither breath of Morn when she ascends <BR>
With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun <BR>
On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, <BR>
Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, <BR>
Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night <BR>
With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon, <BR>
Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet. <BR>
But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom <BR>
This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? <BR>
<BR>
  To whom our general Ancestor repli'd. <BR>
Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht EVE, <BR>
Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth, <BR>
By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land <BR>
In order, though to Nations yet unborn, <BR>
Ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise; <BR>
Least total darkness should by Night regaine <BR>
Her old possession, and extinguish life <BR>
In Nature and all things, which these soft fires <BR>
Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate <BR>
Of various influence foment and warme, <BR>
Temper or nourish, or in part shed down <BR>
Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow <BR>
On Earth, made hereby apter to receive <BR>
Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray. <BR>
These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, <BR>
Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, <BR>
That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise; <BR>
Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth <BR>
Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep: <BR>
All these with ceasless praise his works behold <BR>
Both day and night: how often from the steep <BR>
Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard <BR>
Celestial voices to the midnight air, <BR>
Sole, or responsive each to others note <BR>
Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands <BR>
While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk <BR>
With Heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds <BR>
In full harmonic number joind, thir songs <BR>
Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd <BR>
On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place <BR>
Chos'n by the sovran Planter, when he fram'd <BR>
All things to mans delightful use; the roofe <BR>
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade <BR>
Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew <BR>
Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side <BR>
ACANTHUS, and each odorous bushie shrub <BR>
Fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, <BR>
IRIS all hues, Roses, and Gessamin <BR>
Rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought <BR>
Mosaic; underfoot the Violet, <BR>
Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay <BR>
Broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone <BR>
Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here <BR>
Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none; <BR>
Such was thir awe of man.  In shadier Bower <BR>
More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, <BR>
PAN or SILVANUS never slept, nor Nymph, <BR>
Nor FAUNUS haunted.  Here in close recess <BR>
With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs <BR>
Espoused EVE deckt first her Nuptial Bed, <BR>
And heav'nly Quires the Hymenaean sung, <BR>
What day the genial Angel to our Sire <BR>
Brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd, <BR>
More lovely then PANDORA, whom the Gods <BR>
Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like <BR>
In sad event, when to the unwiser Son <BR>
Of JAPHET brought by HERMES, she ensnar'd <BR>
Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd <BR>
On him who had stole JOVES authentic fire. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv'd, both stood, <BR>
Both turnd, and under op'n Skie ador'd <BR>
The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth &amp; Heav'n <BR>
Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe <BR>
And starrie Pole: Thou also mad'st the Night, <BR>
Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day, <BR>
Which we in our appointed work imployd <BR>
Have finisht happie in our mutual help <BR>
And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss <BR>
Ordain'd by thee, and this delicious place <BR>
For us too large, where thy abundance wants <BR>
Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. <BR>
But thou hast promis'd from us two a Race <BR>
To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll <BR>
Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, <BR>
And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. <BR>
<BR>
  This said unanimous, and other Rites <BR>
Observing none, but adoration pure <BR>
Which God likes best, into thir inmost bower <BR>
Handed they went; and eas'd the putting off <BR>
These troublesom disguises which wee wear, <BR>
Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene <BR>
ADAM from his fair Spouse, nor EVE the Rites <BR>
Mysterious of connubial Love refus'd: <BR>
Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk <BR>
Of puritie and place and innocence, <BR>
Defaming as impure what God declares <BR>
Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. <BR>
Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain <BR>
But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man? <BR>
Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source <BR>
Of human ofspring, sole proprietie, <BR>
In Paradise of all things common else. <BR>
By thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men <BR>
Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee <BR>
Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure, <BR>
Relations dear, and all the Charities <BR>
Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known. <BR>
Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, <BR>
Or think thee unbefitting holiest place, <BR>
Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets, <BR>
Whose Bed is undefil'd and chast pronounc't, <BR>
Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us'd. <BR>
Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights <BR>
His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings, <BR>
Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile <BR>
Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, <BR>
Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours <BR>
Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal, <BR>
Or Serenate, which the starv'd Lover sings <BR>
To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. <BR>
These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept, <BR>
And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof <BR>
Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair'd.  Sleep on, <BR>
Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek <BR>
No happier state, and know to know no more. <BR>
<BR>
  Now had night measur'd with her shaddowie Cone <BR>
Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault, <BR>
And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim <BR>
Forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd <BR>
To thir night watches in warlike Parade, <BR>
When GABRIEL to his next in power thus spake. <BR>
<BR>
  UZZIEL, half these draw off, and coast the South <BR>
With strictest watch; these other wheel the North, <BR>
Our circuit meets full West.  As flame they part <BR>
Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear. <BR>
From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld <BR>
That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. <BR>
<BR>
  ITHURIEL and ZEPHON, with wingd speed <BR>
Search through this Garden, leav unsearcht no nook, <BR>
But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge, <BR>
Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. <BR>
This Eevning from the Sun's decline arriv'd <BR>
Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen <BR>
Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd <BR>
The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: <BR>
Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. <BR>
<BR>
  So saying, on he led his radiant Files, <BR>
Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct <BR>
In search of whom they sought: him there they found <BR>
Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of EVE; <BR>
Assaying by his Devilish art to reach <BR>
The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge <BR>
Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams, <BR>
Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint <BR>
Th' animal Spirits that from pure blood arise <BR>
Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise <BR>
At least distemperd, discontented thoughts, <BR>
Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires <BR>
Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. <BR>
Him thus intent ITHURIEL with his Spear <BR>
Touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure <BR>
Touch of Celestial temper, but returns <BR>
Of force to its own likeness: up he starts <BR>
Discoverd and surpriz'd.  As when a spark <BR>
Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid <BR>
Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store <BR>
Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine <BR>
With sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the Aire: <BR>
So started up in his own shape the Fiend. <BR>
Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz'd <BR>
So sudden to behold the grieslie King; <BR>
Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. <BR>
<BR>
  Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg'd to Hell <BR>
Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd, <BR>
Why satst thou like an enemie in waite <BR>
Here watching at the head of these that sleep? <BR>
<BR>
  Know ye not then said SATAN, filld with scorn, <BR>
Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate <BR>
For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; <BR>
Not to know mee argues your selves unknown, <BR>
The lowest of your throng; or if ye know, <BR>
Why ask ye, and superfluous begin <BR>
Your message, like to end as much in vain? <BR>
To whom thus ZEPHON, answering scorn with scorn. <BR>
Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, <BR>
Or undiminisht brightness, to be known <BR>
As when thou stoodst in Heav'n upright and pure; <BR>
That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good, <BR>
Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now <BR>
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. <BR>
But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account <BR>
To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep <BR>
This place inviolable, and these from harm. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke <BR>
Severe in youthful beautie, added grace <BR>
Invincible: abasht the Devil stood, <BR>
And felt how awful goodness is, and saw <BR>
Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd <BR>
His loss; but chiefly to find here observd <BR>
His lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd <BR>
Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he, <BR>
Best with the best, the Sender not the sent, <BR>
Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, <BR>
Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said ZEPHON bold, <BR>
Will save us trial what the least can doe <BR>
Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. <BR>
<BR>
  The Fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage; <BR>
But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on, <BR>
Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie <BR>
He held it vain; awe from above had quelld <BR>
His heart, not else dismai'd.  Now drew they nigh <BR>
The western point, where those half-rounding guards <BR>
Just met, &amp; closing stood in squadron joind <BR>
Awaiting next command.  To whom thir Chief <BR>
GABRIEL from the Front thus calld aloud. <BR>
<BR>
  O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet <BR>
Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne <BR>
ITHURIEL and ZEPHON through the shade, <BR>
And with them comes a third of Regal port, <BR>
But faded splendor wan; who by his gate <BR>
And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, <BR>
Not likely to part hence without contest; <BR>
Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. <BR>
<BR>
  He scarce had ended, when those two approachd <BR>
And brief related whom they brought, wher found, <BR>
How busied, in what form and posture coucht. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom with stern regard thus GABRIEL spake. <BR>
Why hast thou, SATAN, broke the bounds prescrib'd <BR>
To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge <BR>
Of others, who approve not to transgress <BR>
By thy example, but have power and right <BR>
To question thy bold entrance on this place; <BR>
Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those <BR>
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss? <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus SATAN with contemptuous brow. <BR>
GABRIEL, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise, <BR>
And such I held thee; but this question askt <BR>
Puts me in doubt.  Lives ther who loves his pain? <BR>
Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, <BR>
Though thither doomd?  Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, <BR>
And boldly venture to whatever place <BR>
Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change <BR>
Torment with ease, &amp; soonest recompence <BR>
Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; <BR>
To thee no reason; who knowst only good, <BR>
But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object <BR>
His will who bound us? let him surer barr <BR>
His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay <BR>
In that dark durance: thus much what was askt. <BR>
The rest is true, they found me where they say; <BR>
But that implies not violence or harme. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus hee in scorn.  The warlike Angel mov'd, <BR>
Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd. <BR>
O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise, <BR>
Since SATAN fell, whom follie overthrew, <BR>
And now returns him from his prison scap't, <BR>
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise <BR>
Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither <BR>
Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd; <BR>
So wise he judges it to fly from pain <BR>
However, and to scape his punishment. <BR>
So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, <BR>
Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight <BR>
Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, <BR>
Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain <BR>
Can equal anger infinite provok't. <BR>
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee <BR>
Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them <BR>
Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they <BR>
Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief, <BR>
The first in flight from pain, had'st thou alleg'd <BR>
To thy deserted host this cause of flight, <BR>
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. <BR>
<BR>
  To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern. <BR>
Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, <BR>
Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood <BR>
Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide <BR>
The blasting volied Thunder made all speed <BR>
And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear. <BR>
But still thy words at random, as before, <BR>
Argue thy inexperience what behooves <BR>
From hard assaies and ill successes past <BR>
A faithful Leader, not to hazard all <BR>
Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd. <BR>
I therefore, I alone first undertook <BR>
To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie <BR>
This new created World, whereof in Hell <BR>
Fame is not silent, here in hope to find <BR>
Better abode, and my afflicted Powers <BR>
To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire; <BR>
Though for possession put to try once more <BR>
What thou and thy gay Legions dare against; <BR>
Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord <BR>
High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne, <BR>
And practis'd distances to cringe, not fight. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the warriour Angel soon repli'd. <BR>
To say and strait unsay, pretending first <BR>
Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie, <BR>
Argues no Leader, but a lyar trac't, <BR>
SATAN, and couldst thou faithful add?  O name, <BR>
O sacred name of faithfulness profan'd! <BR>
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? <BR>
Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head; <BR>
Was this your discipline and faith ingag'd, <BR>
Your military obedience, to dissolve <BR>
Allegeance to th' acknowledg'd Power supream? <BR>
And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem <BR>
Patron of liberty, who more then thou <BR>
Once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd <BR>
Heav'ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope <BR>
To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? <BR>
But mark what I arreede thee now, avant; <BR>
Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre <BR>
Within these hallowd limits thou appeer, <BR>
Back to th' infernal pit I drag thee chaind, <BR>
And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne <BR>
The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. <BR>
<BR>
  So threatn'd hee, but SATAN to no threats <BR>
Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines, <BR>
Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then <BR>
Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel <BR>
From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King <BR>
Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers, <BR>
Us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels <BR>
In progress through the rode of Heav'n Star-pav'd. <BR>
<BR>
  While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright <BR>
Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes <BR>
Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round <BR>
With ported Spears, as thick as when a field <BR>
Of CERES ripe for harvest waving bends <BR>
Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind <BR>
Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands <BR>
Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves <BR>
Prove chaff.  On th' other side SATAN allarm'd <BR>
Collecting all his might dilated stood, <BR>
Like TENERIFF or ATLAS unremov'd: <BR>
His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest <BR>
Sat horror Plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe <BR>
What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds <BR>
Might have ensu'd, nor onely Paradise <BR>
In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope <BR>
Of Heav'n perhaps, or all the Elements <BR>
At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne <BR>
With violence of this conflict, had not soon <BR>
Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray <BR>
Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen <BR>
Betwixt ASTREA and the SCORPION signe, <BR>
Wherein all things created first he weighd, <BR>
The pendulous round Earth with ballanc't Aire <BR>
In counterpoise, now ponders all events, <BR>
Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights <BR>
The sequel each of parting and of fight; <BR>
The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; <BR>
Which GABRIEL spying, thus bespake the Fiend. <BR>
<BR>
  SATAN, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, <BR>
Neither our own but giv'n; what follie then <BR>
To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more <BR>
Then Heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now <BR>
To trample thee as mire: for proof look up, <BR>
And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign <BR>
Where thou art weigh'd, &amp; shown how light, how weak, <BR>
If thou resist.  The Fiend lookt up and knew <BR>
His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled <BR>
Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. <BR>
