<p>Jack Carleton cried in the bitterness of vexation and disappointment.
After his daring attempt to get away, and when hope was a-flutter
within him, he awoke to the fact that his captors were trifling
with him. He surveyed the array of gleaming visages, and was sure
that the leader indulged in a distinct wink and grotesque grimace,
as expressive of his views of the situation. Inasmuch as not one
of the red men could utter a syllable of English, perhaps it was
as well that they should have recourse to the sign language. Jack
himself was humiliated beyond expression. Finding he was discovered,
he had risen to his feet and faced his captors with the best grace
he could, and that, it need not be said, was scant indeed.</p>

<p>The Indians grinned and grimaced while they walked around the
lad, as if desirous of surveying him from different points. Jack
dashed the tears from his eyes, and, compressing his lips, braved
it out. He expected some indignity would be offered him, but there
was none. This curious scene lasted only a few minutes, when the
Indians gave the youth to understand that the journey westward
was to be resumed. He was motioned to go forward, and was glad
enough to obey, for his saturated clothes and his highly nervous
condition set his teeth chattering and his body shaking as if
with the ague.</p>

<p>The afternoon was well along, and no great distance could be
passed over before night. Jack dreaded their arrival at the Indian
village before another halt. He was hopeful that in the stillness
and darkness of night he would gain a chance to steal away from
his captors, while the chance of doing so when with the tribe
itself would be much more difficult.</p>

<p>In one respect the wish of the youth was gratified. The party
tramped along in Indian file, without the slightest pause, until
the darkness began stealing among the trees. There was but the
single warrior in front, the others following the lad. Suddenly
the leader stooped down and paused. He was so close to Jack that
evidently he meant to fling him over his shoulders, and the boy
barely escaped such discomfiture. The others grinned again, and
then the party appeared to fall apart and take different positions.
Two vanished in the wood, while the others began hastily gathering
dead limbs and decayed leaves. It seemed to Jack that less than
three minutes had gone by when he saw the dim outlines of one
of the warriors on his knees, striking the flint and steel, such
as the pioneers, and, indeed, all persons, used in those days.
The little lines of sparks shot back and forth, as they do upon
the swiftly revolving emery wheel when the metal is pressed against
it, and in a twinkling a tiny blaze was creeping among the little
pile of leaves toward the top. The twist of flame darted in and
out like the crimson tongue of some serpent, until it reached
the air above, and in a very few minutes a roaring camp fire was
under full headway.</p>

<p>Jack saw that it had been kindled against the shaggy bark of
an oak tree, which swept upward like a sealed chimney until lost
in the gloom above. The gleam of water a short distance off made
known what he had not suspected; a stream&mdash;only a few inches in
depth and breadth&mdash;wound by the spot, without giving forth the
slightest ripple. Water, it may be said, is indispensable to such
an encampment, and a party of aborigines scarcely ever halts at
night without being near it.</p>

<p>As the glow of the fire spread, it fell upon the figures of the
warriors, who looked grim and uncanny. Jack folded his arms and
stood in the full glow, as though seeking a bath in the firelight.
But for his recent experience, he might have been tempted to make
a dash for liberty; but his clothing was still wet from that furious
essay, and he was clearly of the opinion that the only thing for
him to do was to make his captors believe (if it was possible)
that he had given over all hope of getting away. Could he lull
their suspicion, it would be a most important point accomplished;
but the youth might well feel misgivings on that point, for it
presupposed a stupidity on the part of the Indians contrary to
what he knew concerning them.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that the boy believed he could make the
warriors think he was content to remain their prisoner; that would
have been the height of absurdity; but he did seek to convince
them by his manner that he had given up the intention of running
away, because he knew the attempt must be hopeless. Having failed
so completely, he was not foolish enough to repeat the essay,
when he was likely to anger the Indians to that point that they
would punish him for it.</p>

<p>It will be understood, therefore, why Jack Carleton remained
standing with folded arms, while his captors were busying themselves
around him. He looked at the flames as they crept up against the
bark and scorched the rough coat of the massive oak, and he noted
more than one furtive glance cast toward him. He pretended to
see them not, but stood gloomy, sorrowful, and despairing.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dull crack of a rifle rang out, and Jack started.
His first impression was that a party of white men or Indians
had attacked them, but when he noticed the indifference of those
around, he saw his mistake. They did not so much as look to the
right or left, nor make any remark to each other. Evidently they
expected something of the kind.</p>

<p>Within the space of five minutes, the two warriors who had left
a short time before, reappeared. The foremost carried his rifle
at a trail and had no game, but his companion, directly behind
him, held by the feet a large wild gobbler, shot but a short time
previous.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton could not but wonder how it was this dusky hunter
was able to secure the bird on such short notice. The turkeys,
at the time he started to look for them, must have all gone to
roost among the trees. The gloom was such that it was almost impossible
for the keenest eye to distinguish them. They may have given some
evidence of their presence, but Jack was surprised over the success
of the red men in obtaining supper before, as may be said, the
fire could be made ready to roast it.</p>

<p>"Otto and I have hunted for hours in Kentucky where the game
is as abundant as it is here, and we were not able to gain the
first shot at any sort of game. There must be some secret about
this performance which I don't understand, though Deerfoot, with
his bow and arrow, never failed to meet with the same success."</p>

<p>The American Indian is by no means fastidious in his tastes,
and the manner in which they handled the game would hardly have
satisfied a party of modern hunters. Sometimes the red man half
cooks his bird without bothering himself with plucking out the
feathers, and again he doesn't take the trouble even to scorch
his food. In the present instance, they ripped off the principal
part of the feathers, removed the interior, and cutting the framework
into several sections, laid them directly on the coals that were
spread out to receive them.</p>

<p>They began the broiling or scorching operation at once, and the
smell of the burning meat was of the most appetizing nature. Jack
caught a sniff and it literally made his "mouth water," for despite
his unpleasant situation, his appetite was such as every person
in vigorous health is certain to feel at regular intervals.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether they mean to slight me," he suddenly asked
himself with a feeling of dismay; "if they do, I don't know what
will become of me, for I'm sure I never was so a-hungered in all
my life."</p>

<p>But I hasten to say that the disaster which the prisoner feared
did not come to him. Although the bird was unusually large, two
or three of the warriors could have devoured it with ease. As
it was, therefore, it afforded rather scant rations to the company,
but Jack Carleton was remembered and received a juicy slice of
the game, which could not have tasted better had it been hung
up in the cold for a week and then cooked by his mother. Ah, what
art shall ever furnish a sauce like that of hunger itself! The
meal finished, the party disposed of themselves for the night.
Their red clay pipes, with the long reeds for stems, were produced,
filled with tobacco and lit from the fire in front of them. The
blankets&mdash;which were anything but clean&mdash;were spread out on the
ground and their owners assumed all sorts of lazy attitudes, puffed
their pipes, and occasionally grunted a few words to each other.</p>

<p>As Jack had no blanket of his own he reclined on the leaves,
which were comfortable as he could wish. He took pains to place
himself as near the camp fire as he could bear, so as to show
his captors he did not mean to attempt to get away.</p>

<p>Several times during the march and while at supper, Jack heard
the leader addressed, as he believed, by name. He could not catch
the precise word, but it sounded, as nearly as he could tell,
like "Ogallah," which of itself resembles the name of a tribe
of western Indians.</p>

<p>Jack waited till he had heard it again, and then, from the manner
in which it was spoken, he was convinced it was the real name
of the leader of the party,&mdash;that is as near as he could pronounce
it.</p>

<p>By and by there came a lull in the disjointed conversation; the
indolent red men were lolling on their blankets, and the leader
was sitting cross-legged like a Turk, sending rings of smoke upward
and watching them as they curled inward upon themselves and climbed
out of sight. The dimensions of his mouth were that ample that
he could have done the same on either side of the stem without
removing it from between his teeth.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton looked straight at him for a few seconds, and then,
imitating the guttural style of those around as best he could,
pronounced in a distinct voice the single word&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Ogallah!</em>"</p>

<p>At that moment the chin of the chief was in the air and a procession
of rings were tumbling over each other as they hastened from between
his lips. He dropped his head as abruptly as if some one had struck
him in the throat, and with his mouth still in circular shape
allowed the rings to go to ruin, while he stared in amazement
at the boy who had pronounced his name. The others showed as much
wonder as did the chieftain. They also stared at the lad and then
gave expressions to their feelings in their guttural, grunting
fashion.</p>

<p>It was quite embarrassing to Jack Carleton, who blushed, looked
confused, and then tried hard to appear as though he did not feel
specially proud over his performance. The leader addressed some
words to him, as if suspecting he understood his language after
all, but Jack could only smile and shake his head to signify that
he had already exhibited his full proficiency in the tongue of
his captors.</p>
