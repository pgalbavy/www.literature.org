<p>The autumn quiet at Roya-Neh was intensely agreeable to Scott
Seagrave. No social demands interfered with a calm and dignified
contemplation of the Rose-beetle, <em>Melolontha subspinosa</em>,
and his scandalous "Life History"; there was no chatter of girls
from hall and stairway to distract the loftier inspirations that
possessed him, no intermittent soprano noises emitted by fluttering
feminine fashion, no calflike barytones from masculine adolescence
to drive him to the woods, where it was always rather difficult
for him to focus his attention on printed pages. The balm of heavenly
silence pervaded the house, and in its beneficent atmosphere he
worked in his undershirt, inhaling inspiration and the aroma of
whale-oil, soap, and carbolic solutions.</p>

<p>Neither Kathleen nor his sister being present to limit his operations,
the entire house was becoming a vast mess. Living-rooms, library,
halls, billiard-room, were obstructed with "scientific" paraphernalia;
hundreds of glass fruit jars, filled with earth containing the
whitish, globular eggs of the Rose-beetle, encumbered mantel and
furniture; glass aquariums half full of earth, sod, and youthful
larvæ of the same sinful beetle lent pleasing variety to the monotony
of Scott's interior decorative effects. Microscopes, phials, shallow
trays bristling with sprouting seeds, watering-cans, note-books,
buckets of tepid water, jars brimming with chemical solutions,
blockaded the legitimate and natural runways of chamber-maid,
parlour-maid, and housekeeper; a loud scream now and then punctured
the scientific silence, recording the Hibernian discovery of some
large, green caterpillar travelling casually somewhere in the
house.</p>

<p>"Mr. Seagrave, sir," stammered Lang, the second man, perspiring
horror, "your bedroom is full of humming birds and bats, sir,
and I can't stand it no more!"</p>

<p>But it was only a wholesale hatching of huge hawk-moths that
came whizzing around Lang when he turned on the electric lights;
and which, escaping, swarmed throughout the house, filling it
with their loud, feathery humming, and the shrieks of Milesian
domestics.</p>

<p>And it was into these lively household conditions that Kathleen
and Geraldine unexpectedly arrived from the Berkshires, worn out
with their round of fashionable visits, anxious for the quiet
and comfort that is supposed to be found only under one's own
roof-tree. This is what they found:</p>

<p>In Geraldine's bath-tub a colony of water-lilies were attempting
to take root for the benefit of several species of water-beetles.
The formidable larvæ of dragon-flies occupied Kathleen's bath;
turtles peered at them from vantage points under the modern plumbing;
an enormous frog regarded Kathleen solemnly from the wet, tiled
floor. "Oh, dear," she said as Scott greeted her rapturously,
"have I got to move all these horrid creatures?"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake don't touch a thing," protested Scott, welcoming
his sister with a perfunctory kiss; "I'll find places for them
in a minute."</p>

<p>"How <em>could</em> you, Scott!" exclaimed Geraldine, backing
hastily away from a branch of green leaves on which several gigantic
horned caterpillars were feeding. "I don't feel like ever sleeping
in this room again," she added, exasperated.</p>

<p>"Why, Sis," he explained mildly, "those are the caterpillars
of the magnificent Regal moth! They're perfectly harmless, and
it's jolly to watch them tuck away walnut leaves. You'll like
to have them here in your room when you understand how to weigh
them on these bully little scales I've just had sent up from Tiffany's."</p>

<p>But his sister was too annoyed and too tired to speak. She stood
limply leaning against Kathleen while her brother disposed of
his uncanny menagerie, talking away very cheerfully all the while
absorbed in his grewsome pets.</p>

<p>But it was not to his sister, it was to Kathleen that his pride
in his achievements was naïvely displayed; his running accompaniment
of chatter was for Kathleen's benefit, his appeals were to her
sympathy and understanding, not to his sister's.</p>

<p>Geraldine watched him in silence. Tired, not physically very
well, this home-coming meant something to her. She had looked
forward to it, and to her brother, unconsciously wistful for the
protection of home and kin. For the day had been a hard one; she
was able to affix the red-cross mark to her letter to Duane that
morning, but it had been a bad day for her, very bad.</p>

<p>And now as she stood there, white, nerveless, fatigued, an ache
grew in her breast, a dull desire for somebody of her own kin
to lean on; and, following it, a slow realisation of how far apart
from her brother she had drifted since the old days of cordial
understanding in the schoolroom&mdash;the days of loyal sympathy through
calm and stress, in predatory alliance or in the frank conflicts
of the squared circle.</p>

<p>Suddenly her whole heart filled with a blind need of her brother's
sympathy&mdash;a desire to return to the old intimacy as though in
it there lay comfort, protection, sanctuary for herself from all
that threatened her&mdash;herself!</p>

<p>Kathleen was assisting Scott to envelop the frog in a bath towel
for the benevolent purpose of transplanting him presently to some
other bath-tub; and Kathleen's golden head and Scott's brown one
were very close together, and they were laughing in that intimate
undertone characteristic of thorough understanding. Her brother's
expression as he looked up at Kathleen Severn, was a revelation
to his sister, and it pierced her with a pang of loneliness so
keen that she started forward in sheer desperation, as though
to force a path through something that was pushing her away from
him.</p>

<p>"Let me take his frogship," she said with a nervous laugh. "I'll
put him into a jolly big tub where you can grow all the water-weeds
you like, Scott."</p>

<p>Her brother, surprised and gratified, handed her the bath-towel
in the depths of which reposed the batrachian.</p>

<p>"He's really an interesting fellow, Sis," explained Scott; "he
exudes a sticky, viscous fluid from his pores which is slightly
toxic. I'm going to try it on a Rose-beetle."</p>

<p>Geraldine shuddered, but forced a smile, and, holding the imprisoned
one with dainty caution, bore him to a palatial and porcelain-lined
bath-tub, into which she shook him with determination and a suppressed
shriek.</p>

<p>That night at dinner Scott looked up at his sister with something
of the old-time interest and confidence.</p>

<p>"I was pretty sure you'd take an interest in all these things,
sooner or later. I tell you, Geraldine, it will be half the fun
if you'll go into it with us."</p>

<p>"I want to," said his sister, smiling, "but don't hurry my progress
or you'll scare me half to death."</p>

<p>The tragic necessity for occupation, for interesting herself
in something sufficient to take her out of herself, she now understood,
and the deep longing for the love of all she had of kith and kin
was steadily tightening its grip on her, increasing day by day.
Nothing else could take its place; she began to understand that;
not her intimacy with Kathleen, not even her love for Duane. Outside
of these there existed a zone of loneliness in which she was doomed
to wander, a zone peopled only by the phantoms of the parents
she had never known long enough to remember&mdash;a dreaded zone of
solitude and desolation and peril for her. The danger line marked
its boundary; beyond lay folly and destruction.</p>

<p>Little by little Scott began to notice that his sister evidently
found his company desirable, that she followed him about, watching
his so-called scientific pursuits with a curiosity too constant
to be assumed. And it pleased him immensely; and at times he held
forth to her and instructed her with brotherly condescension.</p>

<p>He noticed, too, that her spirits did not appear to be particularly
lively; there were often long intervals of silence when, together
by the window in the library where he was fussing over his "Life
History," she never spoke, never even moved from her characteristic
attitude&mdash;seated deep in a leather chair, arms resting on the
padded chair-arms, ankles crossed, and her head a trifle lowered,
as though absorbed in studying the Herati design on a Persian
rug.</p>

<p>Once, looking up suddenly, he surprised her brown eyes full of
tears.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he said, amazed; "what's the row, Sis?"</p>

<p>But she only laughed and dried her eyes, denying that there was
any explanation except that girls were sometimes that way for
no reason at all.</p>

<p>One day he asked Kathleen privately about this, but she merely
confirmed Geraldine's diagnosis of the phenomenon:</p>

<p>"Tears come into girls' eyes," she said, "and there isn't anybody
on earth who can tell a man why, and he wouldn't comprehend it
if anybody did tell him."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you one thing," he said sceptically; "if Rose-beetles
shed tears, I'd never rest until I found out why. You bet there's
always a reason that starts anything and always somebody to find
it out and tell another fellow who can understand it!"</p>

<p>With which brilliant burst of higher philosophy they went out
into the October woods together to hunt for cocoons.</p>

<p>Geraldine, rather flushed and nervous, met them at Hurryon Gate,
carrying a rifle and wearing the shortest skirts her brother had
ever beheld. The symmetry of her legs moved him to reproof:</p>

<p>"I thought people looked that way only in tailor's fashion plates,"
he said. "What are you after&mdash;chipmunks?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said his sister. "Do you know what happened to
me an hour ago? I was paddling your canoe into the Hurryon Inlet,
and I suppose I made no noise in disembarking, and I came right
on a baby wild boar in the junipers. It was a tiny thing, not
eighteen inches long, Kathleen, and so cunning and furry and yellowish,
with brown stripes on its back, that I tried to catch it&mdash;just
to hug it."</p>

<p>"That was silly," said her brother.</p>

<p>"I know it was, now. Because I ran after it, and it ran; and,
one by one, a whole herd of the cunning little things sprang out
of the hemlock scrub and went off bucking and bucketing in all
directions, and I, like a simpleton, hard after one of them&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Little idiot," said her brother solicitously. "Are you stark
mad?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm just plain mad. Because, before I knew it, there came
a crash in the underbrush and the biggest, furriest, and wickedest
wild boar I ever saw halted in front of me, ears forward, every
hair on end&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Lord save us, you jumped the sow!" groaned her brother. "She
might have torn you to pieces, you ninny!"</p>

<p>"She meant to, I think. The next thing I knew she came headlong,
mouth open, fairly screaming at me; and I turned and jumped clean
into the Gray Water. Oh, Scott, it was humiliating to have to
swim to the point with all my clothes on, scramble into the canoe,
and shove off because a very angry wild creature drove me out
of my own woods!"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, you won't ever interfere with a sow and pigs again,
will you?" said Kathleen so earnestly that everybody laughed.</p>

<p>"What's the rifle for?" inquired Scott. "You don't intend to
hunt for her, do you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I'm not vindictive or cruel. But old Miller said,
when I came past the lodge, dripping wet, that the boar are increasing
too fast and that you ought to keep them down either by shooting
or by trapping them, and sending them to other people for stocking
purposes. The Pink 'uns want some; why don't you?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to shoot or trap them," said Scott obstinately.</p>

<p>"Miller says they pulled down deer last winter and tore them
to shreds. Everything in the forest is afraid of them; they drive
the deer from the feeding-grounds, and I don't believe a lynx
or even any of the bear that climb over the fence would dare attack
them."</p>

<p>Kathleen said: "You really ought to ask some men up here to shoot,
Scott. I don't wish to be chased about by a boar."</p>

<p>"They never bother people," he protested. "What are you going
to do with that rifle, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"My nerve has gone," she confessed, laughing; "I prefer to have
it with me when I take walks. It's really safer," she added seriously
to Kathleen. "Miller says that a buck deer can be ugly, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" said her brother, laughing; "it's only because you're
the prettiest thing ever, in that hunting dress! Don't tell me;
and kindly be careful where you point that rifle."</p>

<p>"As if I needed instructions!" retorted his sister. "I wish I
could see a boar&mdash;a big one with a particularly frightful temper
and tusks to match."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you that you can't kill a boar," he said in good-humoured
disdain.</p>

<p>"I don't see any to kill."</p>

<p>"Well, I bet you can't find one. And if you do, I bet you don't
kill him."</p>

<p>"How long," asked Geraldine dangerously, "does that bet hold
good?"</p>

<p>"All winter, if you like. It's the prettiest single jewel you
can pick out against a new saddle-horse. I need a gay one; I'm
getting out of condition. And all our horses are as interesting
as chevaux de bois when the mechanism is freshly oiled and the
organ plays the 'Ride of the Valkyries.'"</p>

<p>"I've half a mind to take that wager," said Geraldine, very pink
and bright-eyed. "I think I will take it if&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Please don't, dear," said Kathleen anxiously. "The keepers say
that a wounded boar is perfectly horrid sometimes."</p>

<p>"Dangerous?" Her eyes glimmered brighter still.</p>

<p>"Certainly, a wounded boar is dangerous. I heard Miller say&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Bosh!" said Scott. "They run away from you every time. Besides,
Geraldine isn't going to have enough sporting blood in her to
take that bet and make good."</p>

<p>Something in the quick flush and tilt of her head reminded Scott
of the old days when their differences were settled with eight-ounce
gloves. The same feeling possessed his sister, thrilled her like
a sudden, unexpected glimpse of a happiness which apparently had
long been ended for ever.</p>

<p>"Oh, Scott," she exclaimed, still thrilling, "it <em>is</em>
like old times to hear you try to bully me. It's so long since
I've had enough spirit to defy you. But I do now!&mdash;oh, yes, I
do! Why, I believe that if we had the gloves here, I'd make you
fight me or take back what you said about my not having any sporting
spirit!"</p>

<p>He laughed: "I was thinking of that, too. You're a good sport,
Sis. Don't bother to take that wager&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I <em>do</em> take it!" she cried; "it's like old times and
I love it. Now, Scott, I'll show you a boar before we go to town
or I'll buy you a horse. No backing out; what's said can't be
unsaid, remember:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"King, king, double king,<br/>
Can't take back a given thing!<br/>
Queen, queen, queen of queens,<br/>
What she promises she means!"

</p>
</div>
<p>That was a very solemn incantation in nursery days; she laughed
a little in tender tribute to the past.</p>

<p>Scott was a trifle perturbed. He glanced uneasily at Kathleen,
who told him very plainly that he had contrived to make her anxious
and unhappy. Then she fell back into step with Geraldine, letting
Scott wander disconsolately forward:</p>

<p>"Dear," she said, passing one arm around the younger girl, "I
didn't quite dare to object too strongly. You looked so&mdash;so interested,
so deliciously defiant&mdash;so like your real self&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I feel like it to-day, Kathleen; let me turn back in my own
footsteps&mdash;if I can. I've been trying so very hard to&mdash;to get
back to where there was no&mdash;no terror in the world."</p>

<p>"I know. But, darling, you won't run into any danger, will you?"</p>

<p>"Do you call a hard-hit beast a danger? I've wounded a more terrible
one than any boar that ever bristled. I'm trying to kill something
more terrifying. And I shall if I live."</p>

<p>"You poor, brave little martyr!" whispered Kathleen, her violet
eyes filled with sudden tears; "don't you suppose I know what
you are doing? Don't you suppose I watch and pray&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Did <em>you</em> know I was really trying?" asked the girl,
astonished&mdash;"I mean before I told you?"</p>

<p>"Know it! Angels above! Of course I know it. Don't you suppose
I've been watching you slowly winning back to your old dear self&mdash;tired,
weary-footed, desolate, almost hopeless, yet always surely finding
your way back through the dreadful twilight to the dear, sweet,
generous self that I know so well&mdash;the straightforward, innocent,
brave little self that grew at my knee!&mdash;Geraldine &mdash;Geraldine,
my own dear child!"</p>

<p>"Hush &mdash;I did not know you knew. I am trying. Once I failed.
That was not very long ago, either. Oh, Kathleen, I am trying
so hard, so hard! And to-day has been a dreadful day for me. That
is why I went off by myself; I paddled until I was ready to drop
into the lake; and the fright that the boar gave me almost ended
me; but it could not end desire!... So I took a rifle&mdash;anything
to interest me&mdash;keep me on my feet and moving somewhere&mdash;doing
something&mdash;anything&mdash;anything, Kathleen&mdash;until I can crush it
out of me&mdash;until there's a chance that I can sleep&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know &mdash;I know! That is why I dared not remonstrate when
I saw you drifting again toward your old affectionate relations
with Scott. I'm afraid of animals&mdash;except what few Scott has persuaded
me to tolerate&mdash;butterflies and frogs and things. But if anything
on earth is going to interest you&mdash;take your mind off yourself&mdash;and
bring you and Scott any nearer together, I shall not utter one
word against it&mdash;even when it puts you in physical danger and
frightens me. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded, turned and kissed her. They were following a
path made by game; Scott was out of sight ahead somewhere; they
could hear his boots crashing through the underbrush. After a
while the sound died away in the forest.</p>

<p>"The main thing," said Geraldine, "is to keep up my interest
in the world. I want to do things. To sit idle is pure destruction
to me. I write to Duane every morning, I read, I do a dozen things
that require my attention&mdash;little duties that everybody has. But
I can't continue to write to Duane all day. I can't read all day;
duties are soon ended. And, Kathleen, it's the idle intervals
I dread so&mdash;the brooding, the memories, the waiting for events
scheduled in domestic routine&mdash;like dinner&mdash;the&mdash;the terrible
waiting for sleep! That is the worst. I tell you, physical fatigue
must help to save me&mdash;must help my love for Duane, my love for
you and Scott, my self-respect&mdash;what is left of it. This rifle"&mdash;she
held it out&mdash;"would turn into a nuisance if I let it. But I won't;
I can't; I've got to use everything to help me."</p>

<p>"You ride every day, don't you?" ventured the other woman timidly.</p>

<p>"Before breakfast. That helps. I wish I had a vicious horse to
break. I wish there was rough water where canoes ought not to
go!" she exclaimed fiercely. "I need something of that sort."</p>

<p>"You drove Scott's Blue Racer yesterday so fast that Felix came
to me about it," said Kathleen gently.</p>

<p>Geraldine laughed. "It couldn't go fast enough, dear; that was
the only trouble." Then, serious and wistful: "If I could only
have Duane.... Don't be alarmed; I can't&mdash;yet. But if I only could
have him now! You see, his life is already very full; his work
is absorbing him. It would absorb me. I don't know anything about
it technically, but it interests me. If I could only have him
now; think about him every second of the day&mdash;to keep me from
myself&#11834;"</p>

<p>She checked herself; suddenly her eyes filled, her lip quivered:</p>

<p>"I want him now!" she said desperately. "He could save me; I
know it! I want him now&mdash;his love, his arms to keep me safe at
night! I want him to love me&mdash;<em>love</em> me! Oh, Kathleen!
if I could only have him!"</p>

<p>A delicate colour tinted Kathleen's face; her ears shrank from
the girl's low-voiced cry, with its glimmer of a passion scarcely
understood.</p>

<p>Long, long, the memory of his embrace had tormented her&mdash;the
feeling of happy safety she had in his arms&mdash;the contact that
thrilled almost past endurance, yet filled her with a glorious
and splendid strength&mdash;that set wild pulses beating, wild blood
leaping in her veins&mdash;that aroused her very soul to meet his lips
and heed his words and be what his behest would have her.</p>

<p>And the memory of it now possessed her so that she stood straight
and slim and tall, trembling in the forest path, and her dark
eyes looked into Kathleen's with a strange, fiery glimmer of pride:</p>

<p>"I need him, but I love him too well to take him. Can I do more
for him than that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, my darling," said Kathleen brokenly, "if you
believe that he can save you&mdash;if you really feel that he can&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I am trying to save myself &mdash;I am trying." She turned and
looked off through the forest, a straight, slender shape in the
moving shadows of the leaves.</p>

<p>"But if he could really help you&mdash;if you truly believe it, dear,
I &mdash;I don't know whether you might not venture&mdash;now&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, dear." She slowly closed her eyes, remained motionless for
a moment, drew a deep, long breath, and looked up through the
sunlit branches overhead.</p>

<p>"I've got to be fair to him," she said aloud to herself; "I must
give myself to him as I ought to be, or not at all.... That is
settled."</p>

<p>She turned to Kathleen and took her hand:</p>

<p>"Come on, fellow-pilgrim," she said with an effort to smile.
"My cowardice is over for the present."</p>

<p>A few steps forward they sighted Scott coming back. He was unusually
red in the face and rather excited, and he flourished a stick.</p>

<p>"Of all the infernal impudence!" he said. "What do you think
has happened to me? I saw a wild boar back there&mdash;not a very big
one&mdash;and he came out into the trail ahead, and I kept straight
on, thinking he'd hear me and run. And I'm blessed if the brute
didn't whirl around and roughen up, and clatter his tusks until
I actually had to come to a halt!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to walk in these woods any more," said Kathleen
with sudden conviction. "Please come home, all of us."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said. "I won't stand for being hustled out of
my own woods. Give me that rifle, Geraldine."</p>

<p>"I certainly will not," she said, smiling.</p>

<p>"What! Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it rather looks as though I'm about to win my bet with
you," observed Geraldine. "Please show me your boar, Scott." And
she threw a cartridge into the magazine and started forward.</p>

<p>"Don't let her!" pleaded Kathleen. "Scott, it's ridiculous to
let that child do such silly things&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Then stop her if you can," said Scott gloomily, following his
sister. "I don't know anything about wild boar, but I suppose
straight shooting will take care of them, and Sis can do that
if she keeps her nerve."</p>

<p>Geraldine, hastening ahead, rifle poised, scanned the woods with
the palpitating curiosity of an amateur. Eyes and ears alert,
she kept mechanically reassuring herself that the thing to do
was to shoot straight and keep cool, and to keep on shooting whichever
way the boar might take it into his porcine head to run.</p>

<p>Scott hastened forward to her side:</p>

<p>"Here's the place," he said, looking about him. "He's concluded
to make off, you see. They usually go off; they only stand when
wounded or when they think they can't get away. He's harmless,
I suppose&mdash;only it made me very tired to have him act that way.
I hate to be backed out of my own property."</p>

<p>Geraldine, rather relieved, yet ashamed not to do all she could,
began to walk toward a clump of low hemlocks. She had heard that
wild boar take that sort of cover. She did not really expect to
find anything there, so when a big black streak crashed out ahead
of her she stood stock still in frozen astonishment, rifle clutched
to her breast.</p>

<p>"Shoot!" shouted her brother.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, oh, dear," she said helplessly, "he's gone out of
sight! And I had such a splendid shot!" She stamped with vexation.
"What a goose!" she repeated. "I had a perfectly splendid shot.
And all I did was to jump like a scared cat and stare!"</p>

<p>"Anyway, you didn't run, and that's a point gained," observed
her brother. "I had to. And that's one on me."</p>

<p>A moment later he said: "I believe those impudent boar do need
a little thinning out. When is Duane coming?"</p>

<p>"In November," said Geraldine, still looking vaguely about for
the departed pig.</p>

<p>"Early?"</p>

<p>"I think so, if his father is all right again. I've asked Naïda,
too. Rosalie wants to come&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, for Heaven's sake, don't," he protested. "All I wanted was
a shooting party to do a little scientific thinning out of these
boar. I'll do some myself, too."</p>

<p>Geraldine laughed. "Rosalie is a dead shot at a target, dear.
She wrote asking us to invite her to shoot. I don't see how I
can very well refuse her. Do you?"</p>

<p>"That means her husband, too," grumbled Scott, "and that entire
bunch."</p>

<p>"No; if it's a shooting party, I don't have to ask him."</p>

<p>Her brother said ungraciously: "Well, I don't care who you ask
if they'll thin out these cheeky brutes. Fancy that two-year-old
pig clattering his tusks at me, planted there in the path with
his mane on end! &mdash;You know it mortifies me, Kathleen&mdash;it
certainly does. One of these fine days some facetious pig will
send me shinning up a tree!" He grew madder at the speculative
indignity. "By ginger! I'm going to have a shooting party before
the snow flies," he muttered, walking forward between Kathleen
and his sister. "Keep your eyes out ahead; we may jump another
at any time, as the wind is all right. And if we do, let him have
it, Geraldine!"</p>

<p>It was a beautiful woodland through which they moved.</p>

<p>The late autumn foliage was unusually magnificent, lacking, this
year, those garish and discordant hues which Americans think it
necessary to admire. Oak brown and elm yellow, deep chrome bronze
and sombre crimson the hard woods glowed against backgrounds of
pine and hemlock. Larches were mossy cones of feathery gold; birches
slim shafts of snowy gray, ochre-crowned; silver and green the
balsams' spires pierced the canopy of splendid tapestry upborne
by ash and oak and towering pine under a sky of blue so deep and
intense that the lakes reflecting it seemed no less vivid.</p>

<p>Already in the brooks they passed painted trout hung low over
every bed of gravel and white sand; the male trout wore his best
scarlet fins, and his sides glowed in alternate patterns, jewelled
with ruby and sapphire spots. Already the ruffed grouse thundered
up by coveys, though they had not yet packed, for the broods still
retained their autonomy.</p>

<p>But somewhere beyond the royal azure of the northern sky, very,
very far away, there was cold in the world, for even last week,
through the violet and primrose dusk, out of the north, shadowy
winged things came speeding, batlike phantoms against the dying
light&mdash;flight-woodcock coming through hill-cleft and valley to
the land where summer lingered still.</p>

<p>And there in mid-forest, right in the tall timber, Scott, advancing,
flushed a woodcock, which darted up, filling the forest with twittering
music&mdash;the truest music of our eastern autumn, clear, bewildering,
charming in its evanescent sweetness which leaves in its wake
a startling silence.</p>

<p>Ahead, lining both sides of a gully deep with last year's leaves,
was an oak grove in mid-forest. Here the brown earth was usually
furrowed by the black snouts of wild boar, for mast lay thick
here in autumn and tender roots invited investigation.</p>

<p>"Get down flat and crawl," whispered Scott; "there may be a boar
or two on the grounds."</p>

<p>Kathleen, in her pretty white gown of lace and some sheer stuff,
looked at him piteously; but when he and Geraldine dropped flat
and wriggled forward into the wind, misgiving of what might prowl
behind seized her, and she tucked up her skirts and gave herself
to the brown earth with a tremor of indignation and despair.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer they crept, making very little sound; but they
made enough to rouse a young boar, who jerked his head into the
air, where he stood among the acorns, big, furry ears high and
wide, nose working nervously.</p>

<p>"He's only a yearling," breathed Scott in his sister's ear. "There
are traces of stripes, if you look hard. Wait for a better one."</p>

<p>They lay silent, all three peering down at the yearling, who
stood motionless, nosing for tainted air, listening, peering about
with dull, near-sighted eyes.</p>

<p>And, after a long time, as they made no sound, the brute wheeled
suddenly, made a complete circle at a nervous trout, uttered a
series of short, staccato sounds that, when he became older, would
become deeper, more of an ominous roar than a hoarse and irritated
grunt.</p>

<p>Two deer, a doe and a fawn, came picking their way cautiously
along the edge of the gully, sometimes flattening their ears,
sometimes necks outstretched, ears forward, peering ahead at the
young and bad-tempered pig.</p>

<p>The latter saw them, turned in fury and charged with swiftness
incredible, and the deer stampeded headlong through the forest.</p>

<p>"What a fierce, little brute!" whispered Kathleen, appalled.
"Scott, if he comes any nearer, I'm going to get into a tree."</p>

<p>"If he sees us or winds us he'll run. Don't move; there may be
a good boar in presently. I've thought two or three times that
I heard something on that hemlock ridge."</p>

<p>They listened, holding their breath. Crack! went a distant stick.
Silence; nothing stirred except the yearling who had returned
to the mast and was eagerly nosing among the acorns. They could
hear him crunching the husks, see the gleam of long white teeth
which one day would grow outside that furry muzzle and curve up
and backward like ivory sabres.</p>

<p>Geraldine whispered: "There's a huge black thing moving in the
hemlock scrub. I can see its feet against the sky-line, and sometimes
part of its bulk&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens," breathed Kathleen, "what is that?"</p>

<p>Out of the scrub trotted a huge, shaggy, black thing, all head
and shoulders, with body slanting back abruptly to a pair of weak
hindquarters. Down the slope it ran in quick, noiseless, jerky
steps; the yearling turned his head, still munching, ears cocked
forward. And suddenly the monster rushed at him with a squeal,
and the yearling shrieked and fled, chased clear up the slope.</p>

<p>"It's a sow; don't shoot," whispered Scott. "Look, Sis, you can't
see a sign of tusks. Good heavens, what a huge creature she is!"</p>

<p>Fierce, formidable, the great beast halted; three striped, partly
grown pigs came rushing and frisking down the gully to join her,
filling the forest with their clumsy clatter and baby squealing.
From the ridge the two deer, who had sneaked back, regarded the
scene with terrified fascination.</p>

<p>Presently the yearling rushed them out again, then sidled down,
venturing to the edge of the feeding-ground, where he began to
crunch acorns again with a cautious eye on the sow and her noisy
brood.</p>

<p>Here and there a brilliant blue-jay floated down, seized an acorn,
and winged hastily to some near tree where presently he filled
the woods with the noise he made in hammering the acorn into some
cleft in the bark.</p>

<p>Gradually the sunlight on the leaves reddened; long, luminous
shadows lengthened eastward. Kathleen, lying at full length, her
pretty face between her hands, suddenly sneezed.</p>

<p>The next moment the feeding-ground was deserted; only a distant
crashing betrayed the line of flight where the great fierce sow
and her young were rushing upward toward the rocks of the Gilded
Dome.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," faltered Kathleen, very pink and embarrassed.</p>

<p>Geraldine sat up and laughed, laying the uncocked rifle across
her knees.</p>

<p>"Some of these days I'm going to win my wager," she said to her
brother. "And it won't be with a striped yearling, either; it
will be with the biggest, shaggiest, fiercest, tuskiest boar that
ranges the Gilded Dome. And that," she added, looking at Kathleen,
"will give me something to think of and keep me rather busy, I
believe."</p>

<p>"Rather," observed her brother, getting up and helping Kathleen
to her feet. He added, to torment her: "Probably you'll get Duane
to win your bet for you, Sis."</p>

<p>"No," said the girl gravely; "whatever is to die I must slay
all by myself, Scott&mdash;all alone, with no man's help."</p>

<p>He nodded: "Sure thing; it's the only sporting way. There's no
stunt to it; only keep cool and keep shooting, and drop him before
he comes to close quarters."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, looking up at Kathleen.</p>

<p>Her brother drew her to her feet. She gave him a little hug.</p>

<p>"Believe in me, dear," she said. "I'll do it easier if you do."</p>

<p>"Of course I do. You're a better sport than I. You always were.
And that's no idle jest; witness my nose and Duane's in days gone
by."</p>

<p>The girl smiled. As they turned homeward she slung her rifle,
passed her right arm through Kathleen's, and dropped her left
on her brother's shoulder. She was very tired, and hopeful that
she might sleep.</p>

<p>And tired, hopeful, thinking of her lover, she passed through
the woods, leaning on those who were nearest and most dear.</p>

<p>Somehow&mdash;and just why was not clear to her&mdash;it seemed at that
moment as though she had passed the danger mark&mdash;as though the
very worst lay behind her&mdash;close, scarcely clear of her skirts
yet, but all the same it lay behind her, not ahead.</p>

<p>She knew, and dreaded, and shrank from what still lay before
her; she understood into what ruin treachery to self might precipitate
her still at any moment. And yet, somehow, she felt vaguely that
something had been gained that day which never before had been
gained. And she thought of her lover as she passed through the
forest, leaning on Scott and Kathleen, her little feet keeping
step with theirs, her eyes steady in the red western glare that
flooded the forest to an infernal beauty.</p>

<p>Behind her streamed her gigantic shadow; behind her lay another
shadow, cast by her soul and floating wide of it now. And it must
never touch her soul again, God helping.</p>

<p>Suddenly her heart almost ceased its beating. Far away within,
stirring in unsuspected depths, something moved furtively.</p>

<p>Her face whitened a little; her eyes closed, the lids fluttered,
opened; she gazed straight in front of her, walked on, small head
erect, lips firm, facing the hell that lay before her&mdash;lay surely,
surely before her. For the breath of it glowed already in her
veins and the voices of it were already busy in her ears, and
the unseen stirring of it had begun once more within her body&mdash;that
tired white, slender body of hers which had endured so bravely
and so long.</p>

<p>If sleep would only aid her, come to her in her need, be her
ally in the peril of her solitude&mdash;if it would only come, and
help her to endure!</p>

<p>And wondering if it would, not knowing, hoping, she walked onward
through the falling night.</p>
