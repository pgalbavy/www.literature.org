<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The calm had returned. The sea, changing from the warm glitter
of a gem, and attuned to the grays and blacks of space, resembled
a monstrous cinder under a sky of ashes.</p>

<p>The sun had disappeared, smothered in these clouds that had formed
themselves all at once and everywhere, like some swift corruption
of the upper air. For the best part of the afternoon the ship
and the boat remained lying at right angles, within half a mile
of each other. What light was left in the world, cut off from
the source of life, seemed to sicken with a strange decay. The
long stretch of sands and the sails of the motionless vessel stood
out lividly pale in universal gloom. And yet the state of the
atmosphere was such that we could see clear-cut the very folds
in the steep face of the dunes, and the figures of the people
moving on the poop of the <em>Lion</em>. There was always somebody
there that had the aspect of watching us. Then, with some excitement,
we saw them on board haul up the mainsail and lower the gig.</p>

<p>The four oars beat the sombre water, rising and falling apparently
in the same place. She was an interminable time coming on, but
as she neared us I was surprised at her dashing speed. Sebright,
who steered, laid her alongside smartly, and two of his men, clambering
over without a word, lowered our lug at once.</p>

<p>"We came to reef your sail for you. You couldn't manage that
very well with a one-armed crew," said the young mate quietly
in the enormous stillness. In his opinion, we couldn't expect
now any wind till the first squall came down. This flurry, as
he called it, would send us in smoking, and he was sure it would
help the ship, as well, into Havana, in about twenty-four hours.
He didn't think that it would come <em>very</em> heavy at first;
and, once landed, we need not care how hard it blew.</p>

<p>He tendered me over the gunwale a pocket-flask covered with leather,
and with a screwed silver stopper in the shape of a cup. It was
from the captain; full of prime rum. We were pretty sure to get
wet. He thrust, also, into my hands a gray woollen shawl. Mrs.
Williams thought my young lady might be glad of it at night. "The
dear old woman has shut herself up inside their stateroom, and
is praying for you now," he concluded. "Look alive, boys."</p>

<p>His men did not answer him, but at some words he addressed to
Castro, the latter, in the bows and looking at the coast, growled
with a surly impatience. He was perfectly sure of the entrance.
Had been in and out several times. Yes. At night, too. Sebright
then turned to me. After all, it was not so difficult. The inlet
bore due south from us, and the wind would come true from the
north. Always did in these bursts. I had only to keep dead before
it. "The clouds will light you in at the last,"  he added meaningly,
glancing upwards.</p>

<p>The two sailors, having finished reefing, hoisted, lowered, and
hoisted again the yard to see that the gear ran clear, and without
one look at us, stepped back into the gig, and sat down in their
places. For a moment longer we lay together, touching sides. Sebright
extended his hand from boat to boat.</p>

<p>"You are in God's care now, Kemp," he said, looking up at me,
and with an unexpected depth of feeling in his tone. "Take no
turn with the sheet on any account, and if you feel it coming
too heavy, let fly and chance it. Did I tell you we have sighted
the schooner from aloft? No? We can just make her out from the
main-yard away astern under the land. That don't matter now....
Señorita, I kiss your hands." He liked to air his Spanish....
"Keep cool whatever happens. Dead before it&mdash;mind. And count on
sixteen days from to-morrow. Well. No more. Give way, boys."</p>

<p>He never looked back. We watched the boat being hoisted and secured.
Shortly afterwards, as we were observing the Lion shortening sail,
the first of the rain descended between her and us like a lowered
veil. For a time she remained mistily visible, dark and gaunt
with her bared spars. The downpour redoubled; she disappeared;
and our hearts were stirred to a faster beat.</p>

<p>The shower fell on us, around us, descending perpendicularly,
with a steady force; and the thunder rolled far off, as if coming
from under the sea. Sometimes the muffled rumbling stopped, and
let us hear plainly the gentle hiss and the patter of the drops
falling upon a vast expanse. Suddenly, mingled with a loud detonation
right over our heads, a burst of light outlined under the bellying
strip of our sail the pointed crown of Castro's hat, reposing
on a heap of black clothing huddled in the bows. The darkness
swallowed it all. I swung Seraphina in front of me, and made her
sit low on the stern sheets beneath my feet. A lot of foam boiled
up around the boat, and we had the sensation of having been sent
flying from a catapult.</p>

<p>Everything was black&mdash;perfectly black. At intervals, headlong
gusts of rain swept over our heads. I suppose I did keep sufficiently
cool, but in every flash of lightning the wind, the sea, the clouds,
the rain, and the boat appeared to rush together thundering upon
the coast. The line of sands, bordered with a belt of foam, zigzagged
dazzlingly upon an earth as black as the clouds; only the headland,
with every vision, remained sombre and unmoved. At last it rose
up right before the boat. Blue lightning streamed on a lane of
tumbling waters at its foot. Was this the entrance? With the vague
notion of shortening sail, I let the sheet go from my hand. There
was a jerk, the crack of snapped wood, and the next flash showed
me Castro emerging from the ruins of mast and sail. He uprose,
hurling the wreck from him overboard, then flickered out of sight
with his arm waving to the left, and I bore accordingly on the
tiller. In a moment I saw him again, erect forward, with the arm
pointing to the right, and I obeyed his signal. The clouds, straining
with water and fire, were, indeed, lighting us on our way. A wave
swelled astern, chasing us in; rocking frightfully, we glanced
past a stationary mass of foam&mdash;a sandbar&mdash;breakers.... It was
terrible.... Suddenly, the motion of the boat changed, and the
flickers of lightning fell into a small, land-locked basin. The
wind tore deep furrows in it, howling and scuffling behind the
dunes. Spray flew from the whole surface, the entire pool of a
bay seemed to heave bodily upwards, and I saw Castro again, with
his face to me this time. His black cloak was blowing straight
out from his throat, his mouth yawned wide; he shouted directions,
but in an instant darkness sealed my eyes with its impenetrable
impress. It was impossible to steer now; the boat swung and reeled
where she listed; a violent shock threw me sideways off my seat.
I felt her turning over, and, gathering Seraphina in my arms,
I leaped out before she capsized. I leaped clear out into shallow
water.</p>

<p>I should never in my life have thought myself capable of such
a feat, and yet I did it with assurance, with no effort that I
can remember. More than that &mdash;I managed, after the leap,
to keep my feet in the clinging, staggering clutch of water charged
with sand, which swirled heavily about my knees. It kept on hurling
itself at my legs from behind, while I waded across the narrow
strip of sand with an inspired firmness of step defying all the
power of the elements. I felt the harder ground at last, but not
before I had caught a momentary glimpse of a black and bulky object
tumbling over and over in the advancing and withdrawing liquid
flurry of the beach.</p>

<p>"Sit still here on the ground," I shouted to Seraphina, though
flights of spray enveloped us completely. "I am going back for
Castro."</p>

<p>I faced about, putting my head down. He had been undoubtedly
knocked over; and an old man, with only one hand to help himself
with, ran a very serious risk of being buffeted into insensibility,
and thus coming to his death in some four feet of water. The violent
glare disclosed a body, entangled in a cloak, rolling about helplessly
between land and water, as it were. I dashed on in the dark; a
wave went over my head as I stooped, nearly waist-deep, groping.
His rotary motion, in that smother, made it extremely difficult
to obtain any sort of hold. A little more, and he would have knocked
my legs from under me, but it was as if my grim determination
were by itself of a saving nature. He submitted to being hauled
up the beach, passively, like a sack. It was a heavy drag on the
sand; I felt him bump behind me on the edge of the harder ground,
and a deluge fell uninterruptedly from above. He lay prone on
his face, like a corpse, between Seraphina and myself. We could
not remain there, however.</p>

<p>But where to go? What to do? In what direction to look for a
refuge? Was there any shelter near by? How were we to reach it?
How were we to move at all? No doubt he had expired; and the earth,
swept, deluged, glimmering fiercely and devastated with an awful
uproar, appeared no longer habitable. A thunder-clap seemed to
crash new life into him; the world flared all round, as if turning
to a spark, and he was seen sitting up dazedly, like one called
up from the dead. Through it all he had preserved his hat.</p>

<p>It was fixed firmly down under his chin with a handkerchief,
the side rims over his ears like flaps, and, for the rest, presenting
the appearance of a coal-scuttle bonnet behind, as well as in
front. We followed its peculiar aspect. Driving on under this
indestructible headgear, he flickered in and out of the world,
while, with entwined arms and leaning back against the wind with
all our might, Seraphina and myself were borne along in his train.
He knew of a shelter; and this knowledge, perhaps, and also his
evident familiarity with the topography of the country, made him
appear indomitably confident in the storm.</p>

<p>A small plain of coarse grass was bounded by the steep spur of
a rise. To the left a little river would burst, all at once, in
all its windings into a bluish sulphurous glow; and between the
crashes of thunder there was heard the long-drawn, whistling swish
of the rushes and cane-brakes springing on the boggy ground. We
skirted the rise. The rain beat against it; the lightning showed
its streaming and furrowed surface. We stumbled in the gusts.
We felt under our feet, mud, sand, rocky inequalities of the ground,
and the moving stones in the bed of a torrent, which broke headlong
against our ankles. The entrance of a deep ravine opened.</p>

<p>Its lower sides palpitated with the ceaseless tossing of dwarf
trees and bushes; and, motionless above the sombre tumult of the
slopes, the monumental stretch of bare rock rose on high, level
at the top, and emitting a ghastly yellow sheen in the flashes.
The thunderclaps rolled ponderously between the narrowing walls
of that chasm, that was all aflame one moment, and all black the
next. A torrent springing at its head, and dashing with inaudible
fury along the bottom, seemed to gleam placidly amongst the rounded
forms of inky bushes and pale boulders below our path. Enormous
eddies of wind from above made us stop short and totter breathless,
clinging to each other.</p>

<p>Castro sustained Seraphina on the other side; but frequently
he had to leave us and move ahead, looking for the way. There
was, in fact, a half-obliterated path winding along the less steep
of the two sides; and we struggled after our guide with the unthinking
fortitude of despair. He was being disclosed to us so suddenly,
extinguished so swiftly, that he appeared, always, as if motionless
and posturing in a variety of climbing attitudes. The rise of
the bottom was very steep, and the last hundred yards really stiff.
We did them practically on our hands and knees. The dislodged
stones bounded away from under our feet, unheard, like puff-balls.</p>

<p>At the top I tried to make of my body a shelter for Seraphina.
The wind howled and roared over us. "Up! <em>Vamos!</em> The worst
is yet before us,"  shrieked Castro in my ear.</p>

<p>What could he mean by this? The play of lightning opened to view
only a vast and rolling upland. Fire flowed in sheets undulating
with the expanses of long grass amongst the trees, here and there,
in coal-black clumps, and flashed violently against a low edge
of forests very dark and far away.</p>

<p>"Let us go!" he cried. "Courage, Señorita!"</p>

<p>Courage! The populace said of her that she had never needed to
put her foot to the ground. If courage consists, for a being so
tender, in toiling and enduring without faltering and plaint,&mdash;even
to the very limit of physical power,&mdash;then she was the most courageous
woman in the world, as she was the most charming, most faithful,
most generous, and the most worthy of love. I tried not to think
of her racked limbs, for the very pain and pity of it. We retraced
our steps, but now following the edge of that precipice out of
which we had emerged. I had peremptorily insisted on carrying
her. She put her arms round my neck and, to my uplifted heart,
she weighed no heavier than a feather. Castro, grasping my arm,
guided my steps and gave me support against the wind.</p>

<p>There was a distinct lull. Even the thunder had rolled away,
dwindling to a deep mutter. Castro fell on his knees in front
of me.</p>

<p>"It is here," I heard him scream.</p>

<p>I set Seraphina down. A hooked dart of fire tore in two the thick
canopy of clouds. I started back from the edge.</p>

<p>"What! Here?" I yelled.</p>

<p>"Señor&mdash;<em>Si!</em> There is a cavern below...."</p>

<p>I had seen a ledge clinging to the face of the rock.</p>

<p>It was a cornice inclining downwards upon the wall of the precipice,
as you see, sometimes, a flight of stairs built against the outside
wall of a house. And it resembled a stair roughly, with long,
sloping steps, wet with rain.</p>

<p>"<em>Por Dios</em>, Señor, do not let us stay to think here,
or we shall perish in this tempest."</p>

<p>He howled, gesticulated, shrieked with all the strength of his
lungs. He knew these tornadoes. Brute beasts would be found lying
dead in the fields in the morning. This was the beginning only.
The lightning showed his kneeling form, the eager upturned face,
and a finger pointing urgently into the abyss. The wind was nothing!
Nothing to what would come after. As he shrieked these words I
was feeling the crust of the earth vibrate, absolutely vibrate,
under the soles of my feet, with the sound of thunder.</p>

<p>He unfastened his cloak, and was seen to struggle above his head
with the hovering and flapping cloth, as though he had captured
a black and pugnacious bird. We mastered at last a corner each,
and then we started to twist the whole, as if to wring the water
out. We produced, thus, a sort of short rope, the thickness of
a cable, and the descent began.</p>

<p>"Do not look behind you. Do not look," Castro screeched.</p>

<p>The first downward steps were terrible, but as soon as our heads
had sunk below the level of the plain it was better, for we had
turned about to the rock, moving sideways, cautiously, one step
at a time, as if inspecting its fractured roughness for traces
of a mysterious inscription. Castro, with one end of the twisted
cloak in his hand, went first; I held the other; and between us,
Seraphina, the rope at her back, imitated our movements, with
her loosened hair flying high in the wind, and her pale, rigid
head as if deaf to the crashes. I saw the drawn stillness of her
face, her dilated eyes staring within three inches of the strata.
The strain on our prudence was tremendous. The knowledge of the
precipice behind must have affected me. Explain it as you will,
several times during that descent I felt my brain slip away from
my control, and suggest a desire to fling myself over backwards.
The twigs of the bushes, growing a little below the outer edge
of the path, swished at my calves. Castro stopped. The cornice
ended as a broken stairway hangs upon nothing. A tall, narrow
arch stood back in the rock, with a sill three feet high at least.
Castro clambered over; his head and torso, when he turned about,
were lighted up blindingly between the inner walls at every flash.
Seeing me lay hold of Seraphina, he yelled:</p>

<p>"Señor, mind! It's death if you stagger back."</p>

<p>I lifted her up, and put her over like a child; and, no sooner
in myself, felt my strength leave all my limbs as water runs out
of an overturned vessel. I could not have lifted up a child's
doll then. Directly, with a wild little laugh, she said to me:</p>

<p>"Juan &mdash;I shall never dare come out."</p>

<p>I hugged her silently to my breast.</p>

<p>Castro went ahead. It was a narrow passage; our elbows touched
the sides all the way. He struck at his flint regularly, sparks
streamed down from his hand; we felt a freshness, a sense of space,
as though we had come into another world. His voice directed us
to turn to the left, then cried in the dark, "Stand still." A
blue gleam darted after us, and retired without having done anything
against the tenebrous body of gloom, and the thunder rolled far
in, unobstructed, in leisurely, organ-like peals, as if through
an amazingly vast emptiness of a temple. But where was Castro?
We heard snappings, rustlings, mutters; sparks streamed, now here,
now there. We dared not move. There might have been steep ridges&mdash;deep
holes in that cavern. And suddenly we discovered him on all-fours,
puffing out his cheeks above a small flame kindled in a heap of
dry sticks and leaves.</p>

<p>It was an abode of darkness, enormous, without sonority. Feeble
currents of air, passing on our faces, gave us a feeling of being
in the open air on a night more black than any known night had
been before. One's voice lost itself in there without resonance,
as if on a plain; the smoke of our blaze drove aslant, scintillating
with red sparks, and went trailing afar, as if under the clouds
of a starless sky. Ultimately, it must have escaped through some
imperceptible crevices in the roof of rock. In one place, only,
the light of the fire illuminated a small part of the rugged wall,
where the shadows of our bodies would surge up, repeating our
movements, and suddenly be gone from our sight. Everywhere else,
pressing upon the reflection of the flames, the blind darkness
of the vault might have extended away for miles and miles.</p>

<p>Castro thought it probable. He made me observe the incline of
the floor. It sloped down deep and far. For miles, no doubt. Nobody
could tell; no one had seen the end of it. This cavern had been
known of old. This brushwood, these dead leaves, that would make
a couch for her Excellency, had been stored for years&mdash;perhaps
by men who had died long ago. Look at the dry rot. These large
piles of branches were found stacked up when he first beheld this
place. <em>Caramba!</em> What toil! What fatigue! Let us thank
the saints, however.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he shook his head at the strangeness of it. His
cloak, spread out wide, was drying in the light, while he busied
himself with his hat, turning it before the blaze in both hands,
tenderly; and his tight little figure, lit up in front from head
to foot, steamed from every limb. His round, plump shoulders and
gray-shock head smoked quietly at the top. Suddenly, the fine
mesh of wrinkles on his face ran together, shrinking like a torn
cobweb; a spasmodic sound, quite new to me, was heard. He had
laughed.</p>

<p>The warmth of the fire had penetrated our chilled bodies with
a feeling of comfort and repose. Williams' flask was empty; and
this was a new Castro, mellowed, discoursive, almost genial. It
was obvious to me that, had it not been for him, we two, lost
and wandering in the storm, should have died from exposure and
exhaustion&mdash;from some accident, perhaps. On the other hand I had
indubitably saved his life, and he had already thanked me in high-flown
language; very grave, but exaggerating the horrors of his danger,
as a woman might have done for the better expression of gratitude.
He had been greatly shocked. Spaniards, as a race, have never,
for all their conquests, been on intimate terms with the sea.
As individuals I have often observed in them, especially in the
lower classes, a sort of dread, a dislike of salt water, mingled
with contempt and fear.</p>

<p>Castro, lifting up his right arm, protested that I had given
a proof of very noble devotion in rushing back for an old man
into that black water. Ough! He shuddered. He had given himself
up&mdash;<em>por Dios!</em> He hinted that, at his age, he could not
have cared much for life; but then, drowning in the sea was a
death abhorrent to an old Christian. You died brutally&mdash;without
absolution, and unable, even, to think of your sins. He had had
his mouth filled with horrid, bitter sand, too. Tfui! He gave
me a thousand thanks. But these English were wonderful in their
way.... Ah! <em>Caramba!</em> They were....</p>

<p>A large protuberance of the rocky floor had been roughly chipped
into the semblance of a seat, God only knows by what hands and
in what forgotten age. Seraphina's inclined pose, her torn dress,
the wet tresses lying over her shoulders, her homeless aspect,
made me think of a beautiful and miserable gipsy girl drying her
hair before a fire. A little foot advanced, gleamed white on the
instep in front of the ruddy glare; her clasped fingers nursed
one raised knee; and, shivering no longer, her head drooping in
still profile, she listened to us, frowning thoughtfully upon
the flames.</p>

<p>In the guise of a beggar-maid, and fair, like a fugitive princess
of romance, she sat concealed in the very heart of her dominions.
This cavern belonged to her, as Castro remarked, and the bay of
the sea, and the earth above our heads, the rolling upland, herds
of cattle, fields of sugar-cane&mdash;even as far as the forest away
there; the forest itself, too. And there were on that estate,
alone, over two hundred Africans, he was able to tell us. He boasted
of the wealth of the Riegos. Her Excellency, probably, did not
know such details. Two hundred&mdash;certainly. The estate of Don Vincente
Salazar was on the other side of the river. Don Vincente was at
present suffering the indignity of a prison for a small matter
of a quarrel with another <em>caballero</em>&mdash;who had died lately&mdash;and
all, he understood, through the intrigues of the prior of a certain
convent; the uncle, they said, of the dead <em>caballero</em>.
Bah! There was something to get. These fat friars were like the
lean wolves of Russia&mdash;hungry for everything they could see. Never
enough, <em>Cuerpo de Bios!</em> Never enough! Like their good
friend who helped them in their iniquities, the Juez O'Brien,
who had been getting rich for years on the sublime generosity
of her Excellency's blessed father. In the greatness of his nobility,
Don Balthasar of holy memory had every right to be obstinate....
<em>Basta!</em> He would speak no more; only there is a saying
in Castile that fools and obstinate people make lawyers rich....</p>

<p>"<em>Vuestra Señoria</em>," he cried, checking himself, slapping
his breast penitently, "deign to forgive me. I have been greatly
exalted by the familiarity of the two last men of your house&mdash;allowed
to speak freely because of my fidelity.... Alas! Alas!"</p>

<p>Seraphina, on the other side of the fire, made a vague gesture,
and took her chin in her hand without looking at him.</p>

<p>"Patience," he mumbled to himself very audibly. "He is rich,
this picaro, O'Brien. But there is, also, a proverb&mdash;that no riches
shall avail in the day of vengeance."</p>

<p>Noticing that we had begun to whisper together, he threw himself
before the fire, and was silent.</p>

<p>"Promise me one thing, Juan," murmured Seraphina.</p>

<p>I was kneeling by the side of her seat.</p>

<p>"By all that's holy," I cried, "I shall force him to come out
and fight fair&mdash;and kill him as an English gentleman may."</p>

<p>"Not that! Not that!" she interrupted me. She did not mean me
to do that. It was what she feared. It would be delivering myself
into that man's hands. Did I think what that meant? It would be
delivering her, too, into that man's power. She would not survive
it. And if I desired her to live on, I must keep out of O'Brien's
clutches.</p>

<p>"In my thoughts I have bound my life to yours, Juan, so fast
that the stroke which cuts yours, cuts mine, too. No death can
separate us."</p>

<p>"No," I said.</p>

<p>And she took my head in her hands, and looked into my eyes.</p>

<p>"No more mourning," she whispered rapidly. "No more. I am too
young to have a lover's grave in my life&mdash;and too proud to submit...."</p>

<p>"Never," I protested ardently. "That couldn't be."</p>

<p>"Therefore look to it, Juan, that you do not sacrifice your life
which is mine, either to your love&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;to revenge." She bowed
her head; the falling hair concealed her face. "For it would be
in vain."</p>

<p>"The cloak is perfectly dry now, Señorita," said Castro, reclining
on his elbow on the edge of the darkness.</p>

<p>We two stepped out towards the entrance, leaving her on her knees,
in silent prayer, with her hands clasped on her forehead, and
leaning against the rugged wall of rock. Outside, the earth, enveloped
in fire and uproar, seemed to have been given over to the fury
of a devil.</p>

<p>Yes. She was right. O'Brien was a formidable and deadly enemy.
I wished ourselves on board the <em>Lion</em> chaperoned by Mrs.
Williams, and in the middle of the Atlantic. Nothing could make
us really safe from his hatred but the vastness of the ocean.
Meantime we had a shelter, for that night, at least, in this cavern
that seemed big enough to contain, in its black gloom of a burial
vault, all the dust and passions and hates of a nation....</p>

<p>Afterwards Castro and I sat murmuring by the diminished fire.
He had much to say about the history of this cave. There was a
tradition that the ancient buccaneers had held their revels in
it. The stone on which the senorita had been sitting was supposed
to have been the throne of their chief. A ferocious band they
were, without the fear of God or devil&mdash;mostly English. The Rio
Medio picaroons had used this cavern, occasionally, up to a year
or so ago. But there were always ugly affairs with the people
on the estate&mdash;the <em>vaqueros</em>. In his younger days Don
Balthasar, having whole leagues of grass land here, had introduced
a herd of cattle; then, as the Africans are useless for that work,
he had ordered some peons from Mexico to be brought over with
their families&mdash;ignorant men, who hardly knew how to make the
sign of the cross. The quarrels had been about the cattle, which
the <em>Lugareños</em> killed for meat. The peons rode over them,
and there were many wounds on both sides. Then, the last time
a Rio Medio schooner was lying here (after looting a ship outside),
there was some gambling going on (they played round this very
stone), and Manuel&mdash;(<em>Si, Señor</em>, this same Manuel the
singer&mdash;<em>Bestia!</em>)&mdash;in a dispute over the stakes, killed
a peon, striking him unexpectedly with a knife in the throat.
No vengeance was taken for this, because the <em>Lugareños</em>
sailed away at once; but the widow made a great noise, and some
rumours came to the ears of Don Balthasar himself&mdash;for he, Castro,
had been honoured with a mission to visit the estate. That was
even the first occasion of Manuel's hate for him &mdash;Castro.
And, as usual, the Intendente after all settled the matter as
he liked, and nothing was done to Manuel. Don Balthasar was old,
and, besides, too great a noble to be troubled with the doings
of such vermin.... And Castro began to yawn.</p>

<p>At daybreak&mdash;he explained&mdash;he would start for the <em>hacienda</em>
early, and return with mules for Seraphina and myself. The buildings
of the estate were nearly three leagues away. All this tract of
the country on the side of the sea was very deserted, the sugar-cane
fields worked by the slaves lying inland, beyond the habitations.
Here, near the coast, there were only the herds of cattle ranging
the <em>savannas</em> and the peons looking after them, but even
they sometimes did not come in sight of the sea for weeks together.
He had no fear of being seen by anybody on his journey; we, also,
could start without fear in daylight, as soon as he brought the
mules. For the rest, he would make proper arrangements for secrecy
with the husband of Seraphina's nurse &mdash;Enrico, he called
him: a silent Galician; a graybeard worthy of confidence.</p>

<p>One of his first cares had been to grub out of his soaked clothes
a handful of tobacco, and now he turned over the little drying
heap critically. He hunted up a fragment of maize leaf somewhere
upon his bosom. His face brightened. "<em>Bueno</em>," he muttered,
very pleased.</p>

<p>"Señor&mdash;good-night," he said, more humanized than I had supposed
possible; or was it only that I was getting to know him better?
"And thanks. There's that in life which even an old tired man....
Here I, Castro... old and sad, Señor. Yes, Señor&mdash;nothing of mine
in all the world&mdash;and yet.... But what a death! Ouch! the brute
water... <em>Caramba!</em> Altogether improper for a man who has
escaped from a great many battles and the winter of Russia....
The snow, Señor...."</p>

<p>He drowsed, garrulous, with the blackened end of his cigarette
hanging from his lower lip, swayed sideways&mdash;and let himself go
over gently, pillowing his head on the stump of his arm. The thin,
viperish blade, stuck upwards from under his temple, gleamed red
before the sinking fire.</p>

<p>I raised a handful of flaring twigs to look at Sera-phina. A
terrible night raged over the land; the inner arch of the opening
growled, winking bluishly time after time, and, like an enchanted
princess enveloped in a beggar's cloak, she was lying profoundly
asleep in the heart of her dominions.</p>
