IT was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying 
on the outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been 
crying there all night, and using the window for a pocket-handker- 
chief. Now, I saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare 
grass, like a coarser sort of spiders' webs; hanging itself from twig 
to twig and blade to blade. On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy; 
and the marsh-mist was so thick, that the wooden finger on the 
post directing people to our village -- a direction which they never 
accepted, for they never came there -- was invisible to me until I 
was quite close under it. Then, as I looked up at it, while it dripped, 
it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me 
to the Hulks. 

<p>The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so 
that instead of my running at everything, everything seemed to 
run at me. This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates 
and dykes and banks came bursting at me through the mist, as if 
they cried as plainly as could be, `A boy with Somebody-else's 
pork pie! Stop him!' The cattle came upon me with like suddenness, 
staring out of their eyes, and steaming out of their nostrils, `Holloa, 
young thief!' One black ox, with a white cravat on -- who even had 
to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air -- fixed me 
so obstinately with his eyes, and moved his blunt head round in 
such an accusatory manner as I moved round, that I blubbered 
out to him, `I couldn't help it, sir! It wasn't for myself I took it!' 
Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of smoke out of 
his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and a flourish 
of his tail. 

<p>All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast 
I went, I couldn't warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed 
riveted, as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running 
to meet. I knew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had 
been down there on a Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old 
gun, had told me that when I was 'prentice to him regularly 
bound, we would have such Larks there! However, in the confusion 
of the mist, I found myself at last too far to the right, and con- 
sequently had to try back along the river-side, on the bank of 
loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide 
out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I had just 
crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and had 
just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the 
man sitting before me. His back was towards me, and he had his 
arms folded, and was nodding forward, heavy with sleep. 

<p>I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his 
breakfast, in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly 
and touched him on the shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it 
was not the same man, but another man! 

<p>And yet this man was dressed in coarse grey, too, and had a great 
iron on his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was every- 
thing that the other man was; except that he had not the same fuce, 
and had a flat broad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this, 
I saw in a moment, for I had only a moment to see it in: he swore 
an oath at me, made a hit at me -- it was a round weak blow that 
missed me and almost knocked himself down, for it made him 
stumble -- and then he ran into the mist, stumbling twice as he went, 
and I lost him. 

<p>`It's the young man!' I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I 
identified him. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, 
if I had known where it was. 

<p>I was soon at the Battery, after that, and there was the right man 
-- hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all 
night left off hugging and limping -- waiting for me. He was 
awfully cold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down 
before my face and die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully 
hungry, too, that when I handed him the file and he laid it down 
on the grass, it occurred to me he would have tried to eat it, if he 
had not seen my bundle. He did not turn me upside down, this 
time, to get at what I had, but left me right side upwards while I 
opened the bundle and emptied my pockets. 

<p>`What's in the bottle, boy?' said he. 

<p>`Brandy,' said I. 

<p>He was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the 
most curious manner -- more like a man who was putting it away 
somewhere in a violent hurry, than a man who was eating it -- but 
he left off to take some of the liquor. He shivered all the while, so 
violently, that it was quite as much as he could do to keep the neck 
of the bottle between his teeth, without biting it off. 

<p>`I think you have got the ague,' said I. 

<p>`I'm much of your opinion, boy,' said he. 

<p>`It's bad about here,' I told him. `You've been lying out on the 
meshes, and they're dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too.' 

<p>`I'll eat my breakfast afore they're the death of me,' said he. 
`I'd do that, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as 
there is over there, directly arterwards. I'll beat the shivers so far, 
I'll bet you.' 

<p>He was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork 
pie, all at once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all 
round us, and often stopping -- even stopping his jaws -- to listen. 
Some real or fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing 
of beast upon the marsh, now gave him a start, and he said, 
suddenly: 

<p>`You're not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?' 

<p>`No, sir! No!' 

<p>`Nor giv' no one the officer to follow you?' 

<p>`No!' 

<p>`Well,' said he, `I believe you. You'd be but a fierce young 
hound indeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a 
wretched warmint, hunted as near death and dunghill as this 
poor wretched warmint is!' 

<p>Something clicked in his throat, as if he had works in him like a 
clock, and was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough 
sleeve over his eyes. 

<p>Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled 
down upon the pie, I made bold to say, `I am glad you enjoy it.' 

<p>`Did you speak?' 

<p>`I said I was glad you enjoyed it.' 

<p>`Thankee, my boy. I do.' 

<p>I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I 
now noticed a decided similarity between the dog's way of eating 
and the man's. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like 
the dog. He swallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, 
too soon and too fast; and he looked sideways here and there 
while he ate, as if he thought there was danger in every direction, of 
somebody's coming to take the pie away. He was altogether too 
unsettled in his mind over it, to appreciate it comfortably, I 
thought, or to have anybody to dine with him, without making a 
chop with his jaws at the visitor. In all of which particulars he was 
very like the dog. 

<p>`I am afraid you won't leave any of it for him,' said I, timidly; 
after a silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of 
making the remark. `There's no more to be got where that came 
from.' It was the certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the 
hint. 

<p>`Leave any for him? Who's him?' said my friend, stopping in 
his crunching of pie-crust. 

<p>`The young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you.' 

<p>`Oh ah!' he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. `Him? 
Yes, yes! <I>He</I> don't want no wittles.' 

<p>`I thought he looked as if he did,' said I. 

<p>The man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest 
scrutiny and the greatest surprise. 

<p>`Looked? When?' 

<p>`Just now.' 

<p>`Where ?' 

<p>`Yonder,' said I, pointing; `over there, where I found him 
nodding asleep, and thought it was you.' 

<p>He held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to 
think his first idea about cutting my throat had revived. 

<p>`Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat,' I explained, 
trembling; `and -- and' -- I was very anxious to put this delicately -- 
`and with -- the same reason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn't 
you hear the cannon last night?' 

<p>`Then, there <I>was</I> firing!' he said to himself. 

<p>`I wonder you shouldn't have been sure of that,' I returned, `for 
we heard it up at home, and that's further away, and we were shut 
in besides.' 

<p>`Why, see now!' said he. `When a man's alone on these flats, 
with a light head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, 
he hears nothin' all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. 
Hears? He sees the soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the 
torches carried afore, closing in round him. Hears his number 
called, hears himself challenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, 
hears the orders ``Make ready! Present! Cover him steady, men!'' 
and is laid hands on -- and there's nothin'! Why, if I see one pur- 
suing party last night -- coming up in order, Damn 'em, with their 
tramp, tramp -- I see a hundred. And as to firing! Why, I see the 
mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad day -- But this man; ' 
he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my being there; `did 
you notice anything in him?' 

<p>`He had a badly bruised face,' said I, recalling what I hardly 
knew I knew. 

<p>`Not here?' exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek merci- 
lessly, with the flat of his hand. 

<p>`Yes, there!' 

<p>`Where is he?' He crammed what little food was left, into the 
breast of his grey jacket. `Show me the way he went. I'll pull him 
down, like a bloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us 
hold of the file, boy.' 

<p>I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other 
man, and he looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on 
the rank wet grass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not mind- 
ing me or minding his own leg, which had an old chafe upon it 
and was bloody, but which he handled as roughly as if it had no 
more feeling in it than the file. I was very much afraid of him again, 
now that he had worked himself into this fierce hurry, and I was 
likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any longer. 
I told him I must go, but he took no notice, so I thought the best 
thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw of him, his head was 
bent over his knee and he was working hard at his fetter, muttering 
impatient imprecations at it and at his leg. The last I heard of him, 
I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still going.
