<p>"What do you suppose Deerfoot once asked me?" said Jack Carleton,
stopping short and staring in the face of his friend, who answered
with native innocence,</p>

<p>"If you vasn't ashamed mit yourself, 'cause you didn't know more
apout de woods?"</p>

<p>"He handed me some cold water in a cup which he made of oak leaves,
and when I thanked him he smiled in that way of his which shows
his beautiful teeth, and asked me whether I always thanked <em>every
body</em> who handed me any thing like that, or who did me a favor;
I told him that I would consider myself rude if I failed to do
so. Then smiling a little more, he came for me! 'Who gives you
the sunlight?' he asked; 'who makes the moon and stars to light
your feet at night? who gave you your good mother, your health,
your food and drink, your clothes, your life? Do you thank Him
when you lie down at night, and when you rise in the morning,
and through the day?'</p>

<p>"I tell you, Otto," continued Jack, "I stood dumb; he has reproved
us both and made us feel thoughtful, but I never had any thing
that went home like <em>that</em>. I have thought of it a hundred
times since then, and that night when I lay down I prayed harder
than ever before, and something told me that my prayers went higher,
and that He who never turns away His ear was pleased. I didn't
say any thing to Deerfoot, but you know, young as we are, that
in running back as far as our memories will carry us there are
some words and little occurrences that stick by us forever. It
is so with that question which was asked me by an American Indian
in the deep woods just as night was closing in about us; his questions
will cling to me if I live a hundred years."</p>

<p>"I nefer heard him speak just dot way," said Otto, who was in
as serious a mood as his companion, "but he said a good many dings
to me and sometimes to both of us which I forgets nefer&mdash;nefer&mdash;nefer!
When he left me and the Injins was as cruel almost as fader and
moder, I dinks a good deal apouts dem; when I was a layin' by
de fire and not knowin' weder dey wouldn't kill me, den I dinks
apout dem again and prays hard; when I swallers de tobacco and
feels as if I was dead, den I prays agin to Him and He makes me
well and prings me owet all right; arter this I nefer forgets
to prays to Him."</p>

<p>There could be no misjudging the sincerity of Otto. Jack heard
nothing in his quaint accent which could cause him to smile. In
truth he was equally thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Most people are willing to call on God when they are in trouble
or they think death is close," was the truthful remark of the
young Kentuckian, "but it seems to me He must despise a person
who forgets all about Him when the danger goes by. I think if
I was ashamed to profess Him before others, He <em>ought</em>
to be ashamed of me when I came to die and called out in my distress."</p>

<p>The conversation continued in this vein, until both awoke to
the fact that they were violating the orders of Deerfoot, by loitering
on the road; they had allowed valuable time to pass unimproved&mdash;that
is according to one view, but in another sense it could not have
been better used.</p>

<p>As if to make amends for their forgetfulness, it was agreed they
should cease talking for the time, and break into a moderate trot,
which both could maintain for half an hour or more without much
fatigue. Jack took the lead, and keeping the right direction,
he struck the pace which resembled that of Deerfoot, though it
was not so rapid nor could he maintain it for a tenth of the time
the Shawanoe could run without becoming tired.</p>

<p>The wood as a general thing was favorable, though the occasional
undergrowth cropping out of bowlders and rocks compelled some
deviation and delayed their advance. No water appeared until they
had gone several miles. Then it was that they found themselves
alongside a stream of crystalline clearness. It was not very broad
nor swift, though quite deep. Standing on one shore, the bottom
could be distinctly seen clean to the other side. The bed was
mainly a reddish clay, and here and there a few pebbles and large
stones, but there was no difficulty in following with the eye
the beautiful concave until the deepest portion in the middle
was reached, and with the same line of beauty it arose to the
land beyond.</p>

<p>"Otto, let's have a swim!" called out Jack Carleton, after admiring
the stream for several minutes.</p>

<p>What youngster could withstand such temptation? The afternoon
was warm, and though rather early in the season, the water itself
could not have been more inviting. The only answer Otto Relstaub
made was to begin disrobing as fast as he could. Then it became
a race between him and Jack as to who should be the first. The
Kentuckian was only a few seconds in advance, and both frolicked
and disported themselves like a couple of urchins who know they
are doing something which they should not do.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had ordered them to push on and not to rest until they
reached the ridge many miles beyond, where he hoped to join them.
He would not be pleased if he should learn in what manner his
wishes had been disregarded.</p>

<p>The boys dove and swam hither and thither, splashing each other
and reveling in the very luxury of enjoyment. It will be understood
how a couple of persons so placed as were they found such a bath
not only a luxury but a necessity. Men who spend days and weeks
in tramping through the woods, without a change of clothing, can
not preserve the most presentable toilet, and the washing of clothing,
which at other times was done by those at home, was looked after
to a greater or less degree by him who was many miles away.</p>

<p>But, oh the other hand, the garments worn by woodmen were far
different from the fashion of to-day. They were tough and enduring,
and the coarse texture next to the skin preserved its good appearance
much longer than does the finer linen we wear. Often Jack Carleton
had washed his, and frolicked in the water or lolled on the bank
until it was given time to dry in the sun. He and Otto did not
do so now, because their consciences would not permit them to
linger long enough. As any wading they might do would leave their
footprints in plain sight on the bed of the stream, they tried
to satisfy their sense of duty by placing their garments and weapons
on a light raft, and swimming behind it while it floated down
stream. In this way they left no trace of whither they had gone,
and a bloodhound would have been baffled in attempting pursuit.</p>

<p>The only mishap of this novel voyage was that while making it,
the gun of Otto rolled off and went like a stone to the bottom,
but the clearness of the current revealed where it lay, ten feet
deep, and it was easy to dive and recover it.</p>

<p>When at last they emerged, a long distance below the point of
entrance, a branch was bent and broken as Deerfoot had told them
to do in case they crossed a river, and donning their garments,
they turned the light raft adrift, and resumed their journey toward
the ridge which still lay a long distance away.</p>

<p>By this time the sun was well down in the sky, and it was clear
that if the elevation was to be reached before going into camp,
several miles would have to be traveled by night, when the moon
would give them scant light indeed; but both had done a good deal
of that kind of traveling, and the prospect caused no uneasiness.
The sight of some game or any thing which could be utilized as
food would have been most welcome to the hungry lads.</p>

<p>Lest it may strike my reader that both were showing a degree
of recklessness inconsistent with their training and character,
it should be said that they kept their ears open for sounds from
the rear. It was not considered possible for the Pawnees to press
the pursuit with any vigor without the discharge of more than
one firearm. The instant such report reached the youths, such
tardiness would end.</p>

<p>That report came just before the sun sank from sight. Faint but
distant as it floated to them from across the miles of wilderness,
it told (like the sound of Otto's gun when heard by Deerfoot)
an important truth; the Pawnees were on the southern side of the
further ridge, and were pushing the pursuit of the boys with a
persistency that left no doubt of their earnestness.</p>

<p>"I dinks we petter goes fast," said Otto, breaking into a trot,
which Jack imitated in order to prevent himself from falling behind.
They kept it up until the gathering darkness forced them to moderate
their pace. A couple of miles still remained to be passed over,
but their training rendered that an easy matter, and, but for
the craving hunger, there would have been little choice between
that and stopping short where they were.</p>

<p>The boys were relieved over one fact: they had come upon no broad
stream or river. Indeed, they had seen but the one stream which
proved such a means of enjoyment to them, and the configuration
of the country rendered it unlikely that they would meet any thing
of the kind, until after passing the ridge where they expected
to go into camp.</p>

<p>Another source of relief was the certainty that their long swim
down the stream would be an obstacle to pursuit by their enemies.
They would be compelled to make search before the trail could
be recovered, and that would take till the rising of the morrow's
sun.</p>

<p>And thus it was that, while hurrying on, they were shut in by
darkness, and progress became difficult. Even had the moon been
at its full, the dense shadows under the trees would have rendered
the sense of touch more useful than that of sight, but, as it
was, they were making good progress when Jack, who still kept
a slight lead, exclaimed in an undertone:</p>

<p>"By gracious, Otto, there's a light ahead! What can it mean?"</p>

<p>"It means dot some wood ish burning, I dinks."</p>

<p>Of one thing the boys were convinced&mdash;whoever had kindled the
camp-fire was not a Pawnee. None of them could have reached such
a position in advance of the fugitives, and the villages of the
tribe were so far to the north-west that no other beside the main
party were in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot told us that we must not camp this side of that ridge,"
added Jack, "so we'll keep on until we find out who our neighbors
are."</p>

<p>This was an easy matter, since no effort had been made to hide
the light of the fire, which was visible a long distance away.
As is the case at such, times, it appeared to be closer than it
was, both the lads expressing disappointment that it seemed to
recede, like the <em>ignis fatuus</em>, as they walked toward
it.</p>

<p>But when at last our friends halted within a few rods, they were
amazed to see but a single warrior in camp. It required some maneuvering
to make certain on the point, but the fact was not only demonstrated,
but the equally astonishing truth was established that the warrior
belonged to the Sauk nation.</p>

<p>Both lads were so familiar with that people that it was scarcely
possible to err. In spite of what Jack Carleton had said about
the similarity in appearance of all Indian warriors, there were
peculiarities of dress and looks which identified them. More than
that, the young Kentuckian recalled this one, whom he had seen
during his own captivity among that people. He was one of the
wildest revelers at the feast described in "Campfire and Wigwam",
though generally he was reserved. What drew Jack toward him was
the recollection that no one in the village showed more consideration
toward him than did he who sat on the blanket smoking his pipe
and looking into the fire, as if in deep reverie. He had interfered
several times when the prisoner was threatened with violence,
and was so consistent, indeed, in his chivalry, that when Jack
had assured himself the Sank was alone, he walked forward with
Otto at his heels, and offered his hand.</p>

<p>The red man showed no surprise, though he must have been astonished
to meet the white youths so many miles from their own home. He
rose to his feet, without any appearance of haste, shook hands
with both, muttering something which was doubtless meant as a
welcome. Jack managed to speak a few words in the Sauk language,
but, for practical purposes, they might as well have remained
unspoken.</p>

<p>But several facts were extracted from the Indian which added
to the pleasure of the visitors. The Sauk was alone, he had not
seen any Indians for several days, and he had some meat left from
that which he had rudely broiled for his own meal. When I say
he placed this at the disposal of the guests, it need not be added
that in a short time there was none of it left.</p>

<p>The reason why the Sauk had fixed on that spot for his camp was
that a tiny spring bubbled from under some rocks near at hand.
The bowl-like cavity, in which it collected before rippling away
among the gnarled roots of the trees, held enough to afford all
they could wish. The added moisture of this spring, as is often
the case, nourished a vigorous growth of succulent green grass,
which was also turned to good account.</p>

<p>Just as the boys finished eating, they were startled by the whinney
and stamp of a horse near them. They looked inquiringly at the
Sauk, who smiled and nodded in a fashion which showed that the
animal belonged to him. Instead of traveling the long distance
on foot, as did our friends, he had ridden a horse, which had
been cropping the grass close at hand when the boys came up. The
latter's reconnoissance of the camp before presenting themselves
failed to show the presence of the animal.</p>

<p>Observing the interest of the boys, the Sauk picked up a brand
from the camp-fire, swung it over his head until it was fanned
into a vigorous flame, and then motioned them to follow him, while
he showed his steed, of which he was very proud.</p>

<p>The horse snuffed and displayed some timidity when the flame
was brought near him, but a few words from his master quieted
him, and he stood still while the three walked around and admired
his points. The boys said nothing until they were through. Then
Jack, with the firelight lighting up his face, looked at Otto,
who laughed and nodded his head.</p>

<p>The two had discovered the fact that the horse before them belonged
to Otto Relstaub, and was the one for which the poor lad had hunted
in vain so long and which, therefore, was the cause of all the
misfortunes that had befallen him and Jack Carleton.</p>
