<p><em>AFTER </em>a while Marceline was able to persuade Théophraste
to confide in M. Adolphe Lecamus. She declared that Adolphe’s
great experience, his certain knowledge of the science of metaphysics,
ought to be a great help to a man who had buried treasures two
hundred years before and wished to find them again. "And," she
added, "it is he who will be able to reveal your identity."</p>

<p>He yielded to her persuasions, and in the morning told Adolphe
everything. Adolphe was astonished, and it surprised Théophraste
that a man who professed Spiritualism should show so much emotion
when face to face with a reincarnated spirit. He said that Théophraste’s
conduct at the dinner table the day before and the words he uttered
to him before and since the visit to the Conciergerie were well
calculated to prepare him for such a confidence, but he did not
expect such a thing as this. He demanded to see the proof of such
a phenomenon. Théophraste readily showed the document, and Adolphe
could not deny the authenticity of it. He recognized the handwriting
at once, and exclaimed, upon examination, that the handwriting
explained many things to him. He had often thought how curiously
the characters in Théophraste’s handwriting differed from his
real character. It had always been difficult for him to associate
the handwriting with Théophraste.</p>

<p>"Really," said Théophraste, "what character do you ascribe to
me?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you will promise not to bear me any ill, I will tell
you!"</p>

<p>On this assurance he painted Théophraste’s character. It was
that of a kind citizen, an honest merchant, an excellent husband,
but a man incapable of showing any firmness, wit or energy. He
told him also that his timidity was excessive, and that kindness
was always ready to degenerate into weakness. The picture was
not at all flattering, and Théophraste felt a little hurt.</p>

<p>"And now," said he, "that you have told me what you think of
my character, tell me what you think of my writing."</p>

<p>Then he made observations on his handwriting which would not
have failed to make him quite angry if he had not remembered that
Signor Petito had said the same. He said:</p>

<p>"Your writing expresses all the contrary sentiments in your nature
as I know it, and I can imagine nothing more antithetical than
your writing and your real character. Thus you do not write a
characteristic hand, but the handwriting of the Other."</p>

<p>Théophraste was deeply interested. He thought of the strength
and energy of the Other, he imagined that he was a great captain.
However, Adolphe’s next remark completely disillusioned him.</p>

<p>"Any sign in those formations, in the pointed fashion they have
of reuniting, and in the way of growing tall and of climbing up,
and of passing each other, show energy, firmness, obstinacy, ardor,
activity, and ambition, but all for evil."</p>

<p>This dismayed him, but he exclaimed with a show of spirit: "Where
is the evil? Where is the good? If Attila had known how to write
perhaps he would have written like Napoleon."</p>

<p>"They called Attila the scourge of God."</p>

<p>"And Napoleon the scourge of man," replied Théophraste, with
difficulty controlling his anger.</p>

<p>How could it be that Théophraste Longuet could have been anything
else but an honest being before his birth, during his life, and
after his death?</p>

<p>Marceline agreed with him, and Adolphe fearing that he had gone
too far made apologies.</p>
