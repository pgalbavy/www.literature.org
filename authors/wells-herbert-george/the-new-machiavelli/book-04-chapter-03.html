<P>
And then we broke down.  We broke our faith with both Margaret and 
Shoesmith, flung career and duty out of our lives, and went away 
together.
<P>
It is only now, almost a year after these events, that I can begin 
to see what happened to me.  At the time it seemed to me I was a 
rational, responsible creature, but indeed I had not parted from her 
two days before I became a monomaniac to whom nothing could matter 
but Isabel.  Every truth had to be squared to that obsession, every 
duty.  It astounds me to think how I forgot Margaret, forgot my 
work, forgot everything but that we two were parted.  I still 
believe that with better chances we might have escaped the 
consequences of the emotional storm that presently seized us both.  
But we had no foresight of that, and no preparation for it, and our 
circumstances betrayed us.  It was partly Shoesmith's unwisdom in 
delaying his marriage until after the end of the session--partly my 
own amazing folly in returning within four days to Westminster.  But 
we were all of us intent upon the defeat of scandal and the complete 
restoration of appearances.  It seemed necessary that Shoesmith's 
marriage should not seem to be hurried, still more necessary that I 
should not vanish inexplicably.  I had to be visible with Margaret 
in London just as much as possible; we went to restaurants, we 
visited the theatre; we could even contemplate the possibility of my 
presence at the wedding.  For that, however, we had schemed a 
weekend visit to Wales, and a fictitious sprained ankle at the last 
moment which would justify my absence. . . .
<P>
I cannot convey to you the intolerable wretchedness and rebellion of 
my separation from Isabel.  It seemed that in the past two years all 
my thoughts had spun commisures to Isabel's brain and I could think 
of nothing that did not lead me surely to the need of the one 
intimate I had found in the world.  I came back to the House and the 
office and my home, I filled all my days with appointments and duty, 
and it did not save me in the least from a lonely emptiness such as 
I had never felt before in all my life.  I had little sleep.  In the 
daytime I did a hundred things, I even spoke in the House on two 
occasions, and by my own low standards spoke well, and it seemed to 
me that I was going about in my own brain like a hushed survivor in 
a house whose owner lies dead upstairs.
<P>
I came to a crisis after that wild dinner of Tarvrille's.  Something 
in that stripped my soul bare.
<P>
It was an occasion made absurd and strange by the odd accident that 
the house caught fire upstairs while we were dining below.  It was a 
men's dinner--"  A dinner of all sorts," said Tarvrille, when he 
invited me; "everything from Evesham and Gane to Wilkins the author, 
and Heaven knows what will happen!"  I remember that afterwards 
Tarvrille was accused of having planned the fire to make his dinner 
a marvel and a memory.  It was indeed a wonderful occasion, and I 
suppose if I had not been altogether drenched in misery, I should 
have found the same wild amusement in it that glowed in all the 
others.  There were one or two university dons, Lord George Fester, 
the racing man, Panmure, the artist, two or three big City men, 
Weston Massinghay and another prominent Liberal whose name I can't 
remember, the three men Tarvrille had promised and Esmeer, Lord 
Wrassleton, Waulsort, the member for Monckton, Neal and several 
others.  We began a little coldly, with duologues, but the 
conversation was already becoming general--so far as such a long 
table permitted--when the fire asserted itself.
<P>
It asserted itself first as a penetrating and emphatic smell of 
burning rubber,--it was caused by the fusing of an electric wire.  
The reek forced its way into the discussion of the Pekin massacres 
that had sprung up between Evesham, Waulsort, and the others at the 
end of the table.  "Something burning," said the man next to me.
<P>
"Something must be burning," said Panmure.
<P>
Tarvrille hated undignified interruptions.  He had a particularly 
imperturbable butler with a cadaverous sad face and an eye of rigid 
disapproval.  He spoke to this individual over his shoulder.  "Just 
see, will you," he said, and caught up the pause in the talk to his 
left.
<P>
Wilkins was asking questions, and I, too, was curious.  The story of 
the siege of the Legations in China in the year 1900 and all that 
followed upon that, is just one of those disturbing interludes in 
history that refuse to join on to that general scheme of 
protestation by which civilisation is maintained.  It is a break in 
the general flow of experience as disconcerting to statecraft as the 
robbery of my knife and the scuffle that followed it had been to me 
when I was a boy at Penge.  It is like a tear in a curtain revealing 
quite unexpected backgrounds.  I had never given the business a 
thought for years; now this talk brought back a string of pictures 
to my mind; how the reliefs arrived and the plundering began, how 
section after section of the International Army was drawn into 
murder and pillage, how the infection spread upward until the wives 
of Ministers were busy looting, and the very sentinels stripped and 
crawled like snakes into the Palace they were set to guard.  It did 
not stop at robbery, men were murdered, women, being plundered, were 
outraged, children were butchered, strong men had found themselves 
with arms in a lawless, defenceless city, and this had followed.  
Now it was all recalled.
<P>
"Respectable ladies addicted to district visiting at home were as 
bad as any one," said Panmure.  "Glazebrook told me of one--flushed 
like a woman at a bargain sale, he said--and when he pointed out to 
her that the silk she'd got was bloodstained, she just said, 'Oh, 
bother!' and threw it aside and went back. . . ."
<P>
We became aware that Tarvrille's butler had returned.  We tried not 
to seem to listen.
<P>
"Beg pardon, m'lord," he said.  "The house IS on fire, m'lord."
<P>
"Upstairs, m'lord."
<P>
"Just overhead, m'lord."
<P>
"The maids are throwing water, m'lord, and I've telephoned FIRE."
<P>
"No, m'lord, no immediate danger."
<P>
"It's all right," said Tarvrille to the table generally.  Go on!  
It's not a general conflagration, and the fire brigade won't be five 
minutes.  Don't see that it's our affair.  The stuff's insured.  
They say old Lady Paskershortly was dreadful.  Like a harpy.  The 
Dowager Empress had shown her some little things of hers.  Pet 
things--hidden away.  Susan went straight for them--used to take an 
umbrella for the silks.  Born shoplifter."
<P>
It was evident he didn't want his dinner spoilt, and we played up 
loyally.
<P>
"This is recorded history," said Wilkins,--" practically.  It makes 
one wonder about unrecorded history.  In India, for example."
<P>
But nobody touched that.
<P>
"Thompson," said Tarvrille to the imperturbable butler, and 
indicating the table generally, "champagne.  Champagne.  Keep it 
going."
<P>
"M'lord," and Thompson marshalled his assistants.
<P>
Some man I didn't know began to remember things about Mandalay.  
"It's queer," he said, "how people break out at times;" and told his 
story of an army doctor, brave, public-spirited, and, as it 
happened, deeply religious, who was caught one evening by the 
excitement of plundering--and stole and hid, twisted the wrist of a 
boy until it broke, and was afterwards overcome by wild remorse.
<P>
I watched Evesham listening intently.  "Strange," he said, "very 
strange.  We are such stuff as thieves are made of.  And in China, 
too, they murdered people--for the sake of murdering.  Apart, so to 
speak, from mercenary considerations.  I'm afraid there's no doubt 
of it in certain cases.  No doubt at all.  Young soldiers fresh from 
German high schools and English homes!"
<P>
"Did OUR people?" asked some patriot.
<P>
"Not so much.  But I'm afraid there were cases. . . .  Some of the 
Indian troops were pretty bad."
<P>
Gane picked up the tale with confirmations.
<P>
It is all printed in the vividest way as a picture upon my memory, 
so that were I a painter I think I could give the deep rich browns 
and warm greys beyond the brightly lit table, the various 
distinguished faces, strongly illuminated, interested and keen, 
above the black and white of evening dress, the alert menservants 
with their heavier, clean-shaved faces indistinctly seen in the 
dimness behind.  Then this was coloured emotionally for me by my 
aching sense of loss and sacrifice, and by the chance trend of our 
talk to the breaches and unrealities of the civilised scheme.  We 
seemed a little transitory circle of light in a universe of darkness 
and violence; an effect to which the diminishing smell of burning 
rubber, the trampling of feet overhead, the swish of water, added 
enormously.  Everybody--unless, perhaps, it was Evesham--drank 
rather carelessly because of the suppressed excitement of our 
situation, and talked the louder and more freely.
<P>
"But what a flimsy thing our civilisation is!" said Evesham; "a mere 
thin net of habits and associations!"
<P>
"I suppose those men came back," said Wilkins.
<P>
"Lady Paskershortly did!" chuckled Evesham.
<P>
"How do they fit it in with the rest of their lives?"  Wilkins 
speculated.  "I suppose there's Pekin-stained police officers, 
Pekin-stained J. P.'s--trying petty pilferers in the severest 
manner." . . .
<P>
Then for a time things became preposterous.  There was a sudden 
cascade of water by the fireplace, and then absurdly the ceiling 
began to rain upon us, first at this point and then that.  "My new 
suit!" cried some one.  "Perrrrrr-up pe-rr"--a new vertical line of 
blackened water would establish itself and form a spreading pool 
upon the gleaming cloth.  The men nearest would arrange catchment 
areas of plates and flower bowls.  "Draw up!" said Tarvrille, "draw 
up.  That's the bad end of the table!"  He turned to the 
imperturbable butler.  "Take round bath towels," he said; and 
presently the men behind us were offering--with inflexible dignity--
"Port wine, Sir.  Bath towel, Sir!"  Waulsort, with streaks of 
blackened water on his forehead, was suddenly reminded of a wet year 
when he had followed the French army manoeuvres.  An animated 
dispute sprang up between him and Neal about the relative efficiency 
of the new French and German field guns.  Wrassleton joined in and a 
little drunken shrivelled Oxford don of some sort with a black-
splashed shirt front who presently silenced them all by the 
immensity and particularity of his knowledge of field artillery.  
Then the talk drifted to Sedan and the effect of dead horses upon 
drinking-water, which brought Wrassleton and Weston Massinghay into 
a dispute of great vigour and emphasis.  "The trouble in South 
Africa," said Weston Massinghay, "wasn't that we didn't boil our 
water.  It was that we didn't boil our men.  The Boers drank the 
same stuff we did.  THEY didn't get dysentery."
<P>
That argument went on for some time.  I was attacked across the 
table by a man named Burshort about my Endowment of Motherhood 
schemes, but in the gaps of that debate I could still hear Weston 
Massinghay at intervals repeat in a rather thickened voice: "THEY 
didn't get dysentery."
<P>
I think Evesham went early.  The rest of us clustered more and more 
closely towards the drier end of the room, the table was pushed 
along, and the area beneath the extinguished conflagration abandoned 
to a tinkling, splashing company of pots and pans and bowls and 
baths.  Everybody was now disposed to be hilarious and noisy, to say 
startling and aggressive things; we must have sounded a queer 
clamour to a listener in the next room.  The devil inspired them to 
begin baiting me.  "Ours isn't the Tory party any more," said 
Burshort.  "Remington has made it the Obstetric Party."
<P>
"That's good!" said Weston Massinghay, with all his teeth gleaming; 
"I shall use that against you in the House!"
<P>
"I shall denounce you for abusing private confidences if you do," 
said Tarvrille.
<P>
"Remington wants us to give up launching Dreadnoughts and launch 
babies instead," Burshort urged.  "For the price of one Dreadnought--"
<P>
The little shrivelled don who had been omniscient about guns joined 
in the baiting, and displayed himself a venomous creature.  
Something in his eyes told me he knew Isabel and hated me for it.  
"Love and fine thinking," he began, a little thickly, and knocking 
over a wine-glass with a too easy gesture.  "Love and fine thinking.  
Two things don't go together.  No philosophy worth a damn ever came 
out of excesses of love.  Salt Lake City--Piggott--Ag--Agapemone 
again--no works to matter."
<P>
Everybody laughed.
<P>
"Got to rec'nise these facts," said my assailant.  "Love and fine 
think'n pretty phrase--attractive.  Suitable for p'litical 
dec'rations.  Postcard, Christmas, gilt lets, in a wreath of white 
flow's.  Not oth'wise valu'ble."
<P>
I made some remark, I forget what, but he overbore me.
<P>
Real things we want are Hate--Hate and COARSE think'n.  I b'long to 
the school of Mrs. F's Aunt--"
<P>
"What?" said some one, intent.
<P>
"In 'Little Dorrit,'" explained Tarvrille; "go on!"
<P>
"Hate a fool," said my assailant.
<P>
Tarvrille glanced at me.  I smiled to conceal the loss of my temper.
<P>
"Hate," said the little man, emphasising his point with a clumsy 
fist.  "Hate's the driving force.  What's m'rality?--hate of rotten 
goings on.  What's patriotism?--hate of int'loping foreigners.  
What's Radicalism?--hate of lords.  What's Toryism?--hate of 
disturbance.  It's all hate--hate from top to bottom.  Hate of a 
mess.  Remington owned it the other day, said he hated a mu'll.  
There you are!  If you couldn't get hate into an election, damn it 
(hic) people wou'n't poll.  Poll for love!--no' me!"
<P>
He paused, but before any one could speak he had resumed.
<P>
"Then this about fine thinking.  Like going into a bear pit armed 
with a tagle--talgent--talgent galv'nometer.  Like going to fight a 
mad dog with Shasepear and the Bible.  Fine thinking--what we want 
is the thickes' thinking we can get.  Thinking that stands up alone.  
Taf Reform means work for all, thassort of thing."
<P>
The gentleman from Cambridge paused.  "YOU a flag!" he said.  "I'd 
as soon go to ba'ell und' wet tissue paper!"
<P>
My best answer on the spur of the moment was:
<P>
"The Japanese did."  Which was absurd.
<P>
I went on to some other reply, I forget exactly what, and the talk 
of the whole table drew round me.  It was an extraordinary 
revelation to me.  Every one was unusually careless and outspoken, 
and it was amazing how manifestly they echoed the feeling of this 
old Tory spokesman.  They were quite friendly to me, they regarded 
me and the BLUE WEEKLY as valuable party assets for Toryism, but it 
was clear they attached no more importance to what were my realities 
than they did to the remarkable therapeutic claims of Mrs. Eddy.  
They were flushed and amused, perhaps they went a little too far in 
their resolves to draw me, but they left the impression on my mind 
of men irrevocably set upon narrow and cynical views of political 
life.  For them the political struggle was a game, whose counters 
were human hate and human credulity; their real aim was just every 
one's aim, the preservation of the class and way of living to which 
their lives were attuned.  They did not know how tired I was, how 
exhausted mentally and morally, nor how cruel their convergent 
attack on me chanced to be.  But my temper gave way, I became tart 
and fierce, perhaps my replies were a trifle absurd, and Tarvrille, 
with that quick eye and sympathy of his, came to the rescue.  Then 
for a time I sat silent and drank port wine while the others talked.  
The disorder of the room, the still dripping ceiling, the noise, the 
displaced ties and crumpled shirts of my companions, jarred on my 
tormented nerves. . . . 
<P>
It was long past midnight when we dispersed.  I remember Tarvrille 
coming with me into the hall, and then suggesting we should go 
upstairs to see the damage.  A manservant carried up two flickering 
candles for us.  One end of the room was gutted, curtains, hangings, 
several chairs and tables were completely burnt, the panelling was 
scorched and warped, three smashed windows made the candles flare 
and gutter, and some scraps of broken china still lay on the puddled 
floor.
<P>
As we surveyed this, Lady Tarvrille appeared, back from some party, 
a slender, white-cloaked, satin-footed figure with amazed blue eyes 
beneath her golden hair.  I remember how stupidly we laughed at her 
surprise.
<P>
<P>
<P>
2
<P>
<P>
I parted from Panmure at the corner of Aldington Street, and went my 
way alone.  But I did not go home, I turned westward and walked for 
a long way, and then struck northward aimlessly.  I was too 
miserable to go to my house.
<P>
I wandered about that night like a man who has discovered his Gods 
are dead.  I can look back now detached yet sympathetic upon that 
wild confusion of moods and impulses, and by it I think I can 
understand, oh! half the wrongdoing and blundering in the world.
<P>
I do not feel now the logical force of the process that must have 
convinced me then that I had made my sacrifice and spent my strength 
in vain.  At no time had I been under any illusion that the Tory 
party had higher ideals than any other party, yet it came to me like 
a thing newly discovered that the men I had to work with had for the 
most part no such dreams, no sense of any collective purpose, no 
atom of the faith I held.  They were just as immediately intent upon 
personal ends, just as limited by habits of thought, as the men in 
any other group or party.  Perhaps I had slipped unawares for a time 
into the delusions of a party man--but I do not think so.
<P>
No, it was the mood of profound despondency that had followed upon 
the abrupt cessation of my familiar intercourse with Isabel, that 
gave this fact that had always been present in my mind its quality 
of devastating revelation.  It seemed as though I had never seen 
before nor suspected the stupendous gap between the chaotic aims, 
the routine, the conventional acquiescences, the vulgarisations of 
the personal life, and that clearly conscious development and 
service of a collective thought and purpose at which my efforts 
aimed.  I had thought them but a little way apart, and now I saw 
they were separated by all the distance between earth and heaven.  I 
saw now in myself and every one around me, a concentration upon 
interests close at hand, an inability to detach oneself from the 
provocations, tendernesses, instinctive hates, dumb lusts and shy 
timidities that touched one at every point; and, save for rare 
exalted moments, a regardlessness of broader aims and remoter 
possibilities that made the white passion of statecraft seem as 
unearthly and irrelevant to human life as the story an astronomer 
will tell, half proven but altogether incredible, of habitable 
planets and answering intelligences, suns' distances uncounted 
across the deep.  It seemed to me I had aspired too high and thought 
too far, had mocked my own littleness by presumption, had given the 
uttermost dear reality of life for a theoriser's dream.
<P>
All through that wandering agony of mine that night a dozen threads 
of thought interwove; now I was a soul speaking in protest to God 
against a task too cold and high for it, and now I was an angry man, 
scorned and pointed upon, who had let life cheat him of the ultimate 
pride of his soul.  Now I was the fool of ambition, who opened his 
box of gold to find blank emptiness, and now I was a spinner of 
flimsy thoughts, whose web tore to rags at a touch.  I realised for 
the first time how much I had come to depend upon the mind and faith 
of Isabel, how she had confirmed me and sustained me, how little 
strength I had to go on with our purposes now that she had vanished 
from my life.  She had been the incarnation of those great 
abstractions, the saving reality, the voice that answered back.  
There was no support that night in the things that had been.  We 
were alone together on the cliff for ever more!--that was very 
pretty in its way, but it had no truth whatever that could help me 
now, no ounce of sustaining value.  I wanted Isabel that night, no 
sentiment or memory of her, but Isabel alive,--to talk to me, to 
touch me, to hold me together.  I wanted unendurably the dusky 
gentleness of her presence, the consolation of her voice.
<P>
We were alone together on the cliff!  I startled a passing cabman 
into interest by laughing aloud at that magnificent and 
characteristic sentimentality.  What a lie it was, and how 
satisfying it had been!  That was just where we shouldn't remain.  
We of all people had no distinction from that humanity whose lot is 
to forget.  We should go out to other interests, new experiences, 
new demands.  That tall and intricate fabric of ambitious 
understandings we had built up together in our intimacy would be the 
first to go; and last perhaps to endure with us would be a few gross 
memories of sights and sounds, and trivial incidental excitements. . . .
<P>
I had a curious feeling that night that I had lost touch with life 
for a long time, and had now been reminded of its quality.  That 
infernal little don's parody of my ruling phrase, "Hate and coarse 
thinking," stuck in my thoughts like a poisoned dart, a centre of 
inflammation.  Just as a man who is debilitated has no longer the 
vitality to resist an infection, so my mind, slackened by the crisis 
of my separation from Isabel, could find no resistance to his 
emphatic suggestion.  It seemed to me that what he had said was 
overpoweringly true, not only of contemporary life, but of all 
possible human life.  Love is the rare thing, the treasured thing; 
you lock it away jealously and watch, and well you may; hate and 
aggression and force keep the streets and rule the world.  And fine 
thinking is, in the rough issues of life, weak thinking, is a 
balancing indecisive process, discovers with disloyal impartiality a 
justice and a defect on each disputing side.  "Good honest men," as 
Dayton calls them, rule the world, with a way of thinking out 
decisions like shooting cartloads of bricks, and with a steadfast 
pleasure in hostility.  Dayton liked to call his antagonists 
"blaggards and scoundrels"--it justified his opposition--the Lords 
were "scoundrels," all people richer than be were "scoundrels," all 
Socialists, all troublesome poor people; he liked to think of jails 
and justice being done.  His public spirit was saturated with the 
sombre joys of conflict and the pleasant thought of condign 
punishment for all recalcitrant souls.  That was the way of it, I 
perceived.  That had survival value, as the biologists say.  He was 
fool enough in politics to be a consistent and happy politician. . . .
<P>
Hate and coarse thinking; how the infernal truth of the phrase beat 
me down that night!  I couldn't remember that I had known this all 
along, and that it did not really matter in the slightest degree.  I 
had worked it all out long ago in other terms, when I had seen how 
all parties stood for interests inevitably, and how the purpose in 
life achieves itself, if it achieves itself at all, as a bye product 
of the war of individuals and classes.  Hadn't I always known that 
science and philosophy elaborate themselves in spite of all the 
passion and narrowness of men, in spite of the vanities and weakness 
of their servants, in spite of all the heated disorder of 
contemporary things?  Wasn't it my own phrase to speak of "that 
greater mind in men, in which we are but moments and transitorily 
lit cells?"  Hadn't I known that the spirit of man still speaks like 
a thing that struggles out of mud and slime, and that the mere 
effort to speak means choking and disaster?  Hadn't I known that we 
who think without fear and speak without discretion will not come to 
our own for the next two thousand years?
<P>
It was the last was most forgotten of all that faith mislaid.  
Before mankind, in my vision that night, stretched new centuries of 
confusion, vast stupid wars, hastily conceived laws, foolish 
temporary triumphs of order, lapses, set-backs, despairs, 
catastrophes, new beginnings, a multitudinous wilderness of time, a 
nigh plotless drama of wrong-headed energies.  In order to assuage 
my parting from Isabel we had set ourselves to imagine great rewards 
for our separation, great personal rewards; we had promised 
ourselves success visible and shining in our lives.  To console 
ourselves in our separation we had made out of the BLUE WEEKLY and 
our young Tory movement preposterously enormous things-as though 
those poor fertilising touches at the soil were indeed the 
germinating seeds of the millennium, as though a million lives such 
as ours had not to contribute before the beginning of the beginning.  
That poor pretence had failed.  That magnificent proposition 
shrivelled to nothing in the black loneliness of that night.
<P>
I saw that there were to be no such compensations.  So far as my 
real services to mankind were concerned I had to live an 
unrecognised and unrewarded life.  If I made successes it would be 
by the way.  Our separation would alter nothing of that.  My scandal 
would cling to me now for all my life, a thing affecting 
relationships, embarrassing and hampering my spirit.  I should 
follow the common lot of those who live by the imagination, and 
follow it now in infinite loneliness of soul; the one good 
comforter, the one effectual familiar, was lost to me for ever; I 
should do good and evil together, no one caring to understand; I 
should produce much weary work, much bad-spirited work, much 
absolute evil; the good in me would be too often ill-expressed and 
missed or misinterpreted.  In the end I might leave one gleaming 
flake or so amidst the slag heaps for a moment of postmortem 
sympathy.  I was afraid beyond measure of my derelict self.  Because 
I believed with all my soul in love and fine thinking that did not 
mean that I should necessarily either love steadfastly or think 
finely.  I remember how I fell talking to God--I think I talked out 
loud.  "Why do I care for these things?" I cried, "when I can do so 
little!  Why am I apart from the jolly thoughtless fighting life of 
men?  These dreams fade to nothingness, and leave me bare!"
<P>
I scolded.  "Why don't you speak to a man, show yourself?  I thought 
I had a gleam of you in Isabel,--and then you take her away.  Do you 
really think I can carry on this game alone, doing your work in 
darkness and silence, living in muddled conflict, half living, half 
dying?"
<P>
Grotesque analogies arose in my mind.  I discovered a strange 
parallelism between my now tattered phrase of "Love and fine 
thinking" and the "Love and the Word" of Christian thought.  Was it 
possible the Christian propaganda had at the outset meant just that 
system of attitudes I had been feeling my way towards from the very 
beginning of my life?  Had I spent a lifetime making my way back to 
Christ?  It mocks humanity to think how Christ has been overlaid.  I 
went along now, recalling long-neglected phrases and sentences; I 
had a new vision of that great central figure preaching love with 
hate and coarse thinking even in the disciples about Him, rising to 
a tidal wave at last in that clamour for Barabbas, and the public 
satisfaction in His fate. . . .
<P>
It's curious to think that hopeless love and a noisy disordered 
dinner should lead a man to these speculations, but they did.  "He 
DID mean that!" I said, and suddenly thought of what a bludgeon 
they'd made of His Christianity.  Athwart that perplexing, patient 
enigma sitting inaudibly among publicans and sinners, danced and 
gibbered a long procession of the champions of orthodoxy.  "He 
wasn't human," I said, and remembered that last despairing cry, "My 
God!  My God! why hast Thou forsaken Me?"
<P>
"Oh, HE forsakes every one," I said, flying out as a tired mind 
will, with an obvious repartee. . . .
<P>
I passed at a bound from such monstrous theology to a towering rage 
against the Baileys.  In an instant and with no sense of absurdity I 
wanted--in the intervals of love and fine thinking--to fling about 
that strenuously virtuous couple; I wanted to kick Keyhole of the 
PEEPSHOW into the gutter and make a common massacre of all the 
prosperous rascaldom that makes a trade and rule of virtue.  I can 
still feel that transition.  In a moment I had reached that phase of 
weakly decisive anger which is for people of my temperament the 
concomitant of exhaustion.
<P>
"I will have her," I cried.  "By Heaven!  I WILL have her!  Life 
mocks me and cheats me.  Nothing can be made good to me again. . . .  
Why shouldn't I save what I can?  I can't save myself without 
her. . . ."
<P>
I remember myself--as a sort of anti-climax to that--rather 
tediously asking my way home.  I was somewhere in the neighbourhood 
of Holland Park. . . .
<P>
It was then between one and two.  I felt that I could go home now 
without any risk of meeting Margaret.  It had been the thought of 
returning to Margaret that had sent me wandering that night.  It is 
one of the ugliest facts I recall about that time of crisis, the 
intense aversion I felt for Margaret.  No sense of her goodness, her 
injury and nobility, and the enormous generosity of her forgiveness, 
sufficed to mitigate that.  I hope now that in this book I am able 
to give something of her silvery splendour, but all through this 
crisis I felt nothing of that.  There was a triumphant kindliness 
about her that I found intolerable.  She meant to be so kind to me, 
to offer unstinted consolation, to meet my needs, to supply just all 
she imagined Isabel had given me.
<P>
When I left Tarvrille's, I felt I could anticipate exactly how she 
would meet my homecoming.  She would be perplexed by my crumpled 
shirt front, on which I had spilt some drops of wine; she would 
overlook that by an effort, explain it sentimentally, resolve it 
should make no difference to her.  She would want to know who had 
been present, what we had talked about, show the alertest interest 
in whatever it was--it didn't matter what. . . .  No, I couldn't 
face her.
<P>
So I did not reach my study until two o'clock.
<P>
There, I remember, stood the new and very beautiful old silver 
candlesticks that she had set there two days since to please me--the 
foolish kindliness of it!  But in her search for expression, 
Margaret heaped presents upon me.  She had fitted these candlesticks 
with electric lights, and I must, I suppose, have lit them to write 
my note to Isabel.  "Give me a word--the world aches without you," 
was all I scrawled, though I fully meant that she should come to me.  
I knew, though I ought not to have known, that now she had left her 
flat, she was with the Balfes--she was to have been married from the 
Balfes--and I sent my letter there.  And I went out into the silent 
square and posted the note forthwith, because I knew quite clearly 
that if I left it until morning I should never post it at all.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
I had a curious revulsion of feeling that morning of our meeting.  
(Of all places for such a clandestine encounter she had chosen the 
bridge opposite Buckingham Palace.)  Overnight I had been full of 
self pity, and eager for the comfort of Isabel's presence.  But the 
ill-written scrawl in which she had replied had been full of the 
suggestion of her own weakness and misery.  And when I saw her, my 
own selfish sorrows were altogether swept away by a wave of pitiful 
tenderness.  Something had happened to her that I did not 
understand.  She was manifestly ill.  She came towards me wearily, 
she who had always borne herself so bravely; her shoulders seemed 
bent, and her eyes were tired, and her face white and drawn.  All my 
life has been a narrow self-centred life; no brothers, no sisters or 
children or weak things had ever yet made any intimate appeal to me, 
and suddenly--I verily believe for the first time in my life!--I 
felt a great passion of protective ownership; I felt that here was 
something that I could die to shelter, something that meant more 
than joy or pride or splendid ambitions or splendid creation to me, 
a new kind of hold upon me, a new power in the world.  Some sealed 
fountain was opened in my breast.  I knew that I could love Isabel 
broken, Isabel beaten, Isabel ugly and in pain, more than I could 
love any sweet or delightful or glorious thing in life.  I didn't 
care any more for anything in the world but Isabel, and that I 
should protect her.  I trembled as I came near her, and could 
scarcely speak to her for the emotion that filled me. . . .
<P>
"I had your letter," I said.
<P>
"I had yours."
<P>
"Where can we talk?"
<P>
I remember my lame sentences.  "We'll have a boat.  That's best 
here."
<P>
I took her to the little boat-house, and there we hired a boat, and 
I rowed in silence under the bridge and into the shade of a tree.  
The square grey stone masses of the Foreign Office loomed through 
the twigs, I remember, and a little space of grass separated us from 
the pathway and the scrutiny of passers-by.  And there we talked.
<P>
"I had to write to you," I said.
<P>
"I had to come."
<P>
"When are you to be married?"
<P>
"Thursday week."
<P>
"Well?" I said.  "But--can we?"
<P>
She leant forward and scrutinised my face with eyes wide open.  
"What do you mean?" she said at last in a whisper.
<P>
"Can we stand it?  After all?"
<P>
I looked at her white face.  "Can you?" I said.
<P>
She whispered.  "Your career?"
<P>
Then suddenly her face was contorted,--she wept silently, exactly as 
a child tormented beyond endurance might suddenly weep. . . .
<P>
"Oh! I don't care," I cried, "now.  I don't care.  Damn the whole 
system of things!  Damn all this patching of the irrevocable!  I 
want to take care of you, Isabel! and have you with me."
<P>
"I can't stand it," she blubbered.
<P>
"You needn't stand it.  I thought it was best for you. . . .  I 
thought indeed it was best for you.  I thought even you wanted it 
like that."
<P>
"Couldn't I live alone--as I meant to do?"
<P>
"No," I said, "you couldn't.  You're not strong enough.  I've 
thought of that; I've got to shelter you."
<P>
"And I want you," I went on.  "I'm not strong enough--I can't stand 
life without you."
<P>
She stopped weeping, she made a great effort to control herself, and 
looked at me steadfastly for a moment.  "I was going to kill 
myself," she whispered.  "I was going to kill myself quietly--
somehow.  I meant to wait a bit and have an accident.  I thought--
you didn't understand.  You were a man, and couldn't understand. . . ."
<P>
"People can't do as we thought we could do," I said.  "We've gone 
too far together."
<P>
"Yes," she said, and I stared into her eyes.
<P>
"The horror of it," she whispered.  "The horror of being handed 
over.  It's just only begun to dawn upon me, seeing him now as I do.  
He tries to be kind to me. . . .  I didn't know.  I felt adventurous 
before. . . .  It makes me feel like all the women in the world who 
have ever been owned and subdued. . . .  It's not that he isn't the 
best of men, it's because I'm a part of you. . . .  I can't go 
through with it.  If I go through with it, I shall be left--robbed 
of pride--outraged--a woman beaten. . . ." 
<P>
"I know," I said, "I know."
<P>
"I want to live alone. . . .  I don't care for anything now but just 
escape.  If you can help me. . . ."
<P>
"I must take you away.  There's nothing for us but to go away 
together."
<P>
"But your work," she said; "your career!  Margaret!  Our promises!"
<P>
"We've made a mess of things, Isabel--or things have made a mess of 
us.  I don't know which.  Our flags are in the mud, anyhow.  It's 
too late to save those other things!  They have to go.  You can't 
make terms with defeat.  I thought it was Margaret needed me most.  
But it's you.  And I need you.  I didn't think of that either.  I 
haven't a doubt left in the world now.  We've got to leave 
everything rather than leave each other.  I'm sure of it.  Now we 
have gone so far.  We've got to go right down to earth and begin 
again. . . .  Dear, I WANT disgrace with you. . . ."
<P>
So I whispered to her as she sat crumpled together on the faded 
cushions of the boat, this white and weary young woman who had been 
so valiant and careless a girl.  "I don't care," I said.  "I don't 
care for anything, if I can save you out of the wreckage we have 
made together."
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
The next day I went to the office of the BLUE WEEKLY in order to get 
as much as possible of its affairs in working order before I left 
London with Isabel.  I just missed Shoesmith in the lower office.  
Upstairs I found Britten amidst a pile of outside articles, 
methodically reading the title of each and sometimes the first half-
dozen lines, and either dropping them in a growing heap on the floor 
for a clerk to return, or putting them aside for consideration.  I 
interrupted him, squatted on the window-sill of the open window, and 
sketched out my ideas for the session.
<P>
"You're far-sighted," he remarked at something of mine which reached 
out ahead.
<P>
"I like to see things prepared," I answered.
<P>
"Yes," he said, and ripped open the envelope of a fresh aspirant.
<P>
I was silent while he read.
<P>
"You're going away with Isabel Rivers," he said abruptly.
<P>
"Well!" I said, amazed.
<P>
"I know," he said, and lost his breath.  "Not my business.  Only--"
<P>
It was queer to find Britten afraid to say a thing.
<P>
"It's not playing the game," he said.
<P>
"What do you know?"
<P>
"Everything that matters."
<P>
"Some games," I said, "are too hard to play."
<P>
There came a pause between us.
<P>
"I didn't know you were watching all this," I said.
<P>
"Yes," he answered, after a pause, "I've watched."
<P>
"Sorry--sorry you don't approve."
<P>
"It means smashing such an infernal lot of things, Remington."
<P>
I did not answer.
<P>
"You're going away then?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Soon?"
<P>
"Right away."
<P>
"There's vour wife."
<P>
"I know."
<P>
"Shoesmith--whom you're pledged to in a manner.  You've just picked 
him out and made him conspicuous.  Every one will know.  Oh! of 
course--it's nothing to you.  Honour--"
<P>
"I know."
<P>
"Common decency."
<P>
I nodded.
<P>
"All this movement of ours.  That's what I care for most. . . .  
It's come to be a big thing, Remington."
<P>
"That will go on."
<P>
"We have a use for you--no one else quite fills it.  No one. . . .  
I'm not sure it will go on."
<P>
"Do you think I haven't thought of all these things?"
<P>
He shrugged his shoulders, and rejected two papers unread.
<P>
"I knew," he remarked, "when you came back from America.  You were 
alight with it." Then he let his bitterness gleam for a moment.  
"But I thought you would stick to your bargain."
<P>
"It's not so much choice as you think," I said.
<P>
"There's always a choice."
<P>
"No," I said.
<P>
He scrutinised my face.
<P>
"I can't live without her--I can't work.  She's all mixed up with 
this--and everything.  And besides, there's things you can't 
understand.  There's feelings you've never felt. . . .  You don't 
understand how much we've been to one another."
<P>
Britten frowned and thought.
<P>
"Some things one's GOT to do," he threw out.
<P>
"Some things one can't do."
<P>
"These infernal institutions--"
<P>
"Some one must begin," I said.
<P>
He shook his head.  "Not YOU," he said.  "No!"
<P>
He stretched out his hands on the desk before him, and spoke again.
<P>
"Remington," he said, "I've thought of this business day and night 
too.  It matters to me.  It matters immensely to me.  In a way--it's 
a thing one doesn't often say to a man--I've loved you.  I'm the 
sort of man who leads a narrow life. . . .  But you've been 
something fine and good for me, since that time, do you remember? 
when we talked about Mecca together."
<P>
I nodded.
<P>
"Yes.  And you'll always be something fine and good for me anyhow.  
I know things about you,--qualities--no mere act can destroy them. . 
. .  Well, I can tell you, you're doing wrong.  You're going on now 
like a man who is hypnotised and can't turn round.  You're piling 
wrong on wrong.  It was wrong for you two people ever to be lovers."
<P>
He paused.
<P>
"It gripped us hard," I said.
<P>
"Yes!--but in your position!  And hers!  It was vile!"
<P>
"You've not been tempted."
<P>
"How do you know?  Anyhow--having done that, you ought to have stood 
the consequences and thought of other people.  You could have ended 
it at the first pause for reflection.  You didn't.  You blundered 
again.  You kept on.  You owed a certain secrecy to all of us!  You 
didn't keep it.  You were careless.  You made things worse.  This 
engagement and this publicity!--Damn it, Remington!"
<P>
"I know," I said, with smarting eyes.  "Damn it ! with all my heart!  
It came of trying to patch. . . .  You CAN'T patch."
<P>
"And now, as I care for anything under heaven, Remington, you two 
ought to stand these last consequences--and part.  You ought to 
part.  Other people have to stand things!  Other people have to 
part.  You ought to.  You say--what do you say?  It's loss of so 
much life to lose each other.  So is losing a hand or a leg.  But 
it's what you've incurred.  Amputate.  Take your punishment--After 
all, you chose it."
<P>
"Oh, damn!" I said, standing up and going to the window.
<P>
"Damn by all means.  I never knew a topic so full of justifiable 
damns.  But you two did choose it.  You ought to stick to your 
undertaking."
<P>
I turned upon him with a snarl in my voice.  "My dear Britten!" I 
cried.  "Don't I KNOW I'm doing wrong?  Aren't I in a net?  Suppose 
I don't go!  Is there any right in that?  Do you think we're going 
to be much to ourselves or any one after this parting?  I've been 
thinking all last night of this business, trying it over and over 
again from the beginning.  How was it we went wrong?  Since I came 
back from America--I grant you THAT--but SINCE, there's never been a 
step that wasn't forced, that hadn't as much right in it or more, as 
wrong.  You talk as though I was a thing of steel that could bend 
this way or that and never change.  You talk as though Isabel was a 
cat one could give to any kind of owner. . . .  We two are things 
that change and grow and alter all the time.  We're--so interwoven 
that being parted now will leave us just misshapen cripples. . . .  
You don't know the motives, you don't know the rush and feel of 
things, you don't know how it was with us, and how it is with us.  
You don't know the hunger for the mere sight of one another; you 
don't know anything."
<P>
Britten looked at his finger-nails closely.  His red face puckered 
to a wry frown.  "Haven't we all at times wanted the world put 
back?" he grunted, and looked hard and close at one particular nail.
<P>
There was a long pause.
<P>
"I want her," I said, "and I'm going to have her.  I'm too tired for 
balancing the right or wrong of it any more.  You can't separate 
them.  I saw her yesterday. . . .  She's--ill. . . .  I'd take her 
now, if death were just outside the door waiting for us."
<P>
"Torture?"
<P>
I thought.  "Yes."
<P>
"For her?"
<P>
"There isn't," I said.
<P>
"If there was?"
<P>
I made no answer.
<P>
"It's blind Want.  And there's nothing ever been put into you to 
stand against it.  What are you going to do with the rest of your 
lives?"
<P>
"No end of things."
<P>
"Nothing."
<P>
"I don't believe you are right," I said.  "I believe we can save 
something--"
<P>
Britten shook his head.  "Some scraps of salvage won't excuse you," 
he said.
<P>
His indignation rose.  "In the middle of life!" he said.  "No man 
has a right to take his hand from the plough!"
<P>
He leant forward on his desk and opened an argumentative palm.  "You 
know, Remington," he said, "and I know, that if this could be fended 
off for six months--if you could be clapped in prison, or got out of 
the way somehow,--until this marriage was all over and settled down 
for a year, say--you know then you two could meet, curious, happy, 
as friends.  Saved!  You KNOW it."
<P>
I turned and stared at him.  "You're wrong, Britten," I said.  "And 
does it matter if we could?"
<P>
I found that in talking to him I could frame the apologetics I had 
not been able to find for myself alone.
<P>
"I am certain of one thing, Britten.  It is our duty not to hush up 
this scandal."
<P>
He raised his eyebrows.  I perceived now the element of absurdity in 
me, but at the time I was as serious as a man who is burning.
<P>
"It's our duty," I went on, "to smash now openly in the sight of 
every one.  Yes!  I've got that as clean and plain--as prison 
whitewash.  I am convinced that we have got to be public to the 
uttermost now--I mean it--until every corner of our world knows this 
story, knows it fully, adds it to the Parnell story and the Ashton 
Dean story and the Carmel story and the Witterslea story, and all 
the other stories that have picked man after man out of English 
public life, the men with active imaginations, the men of strong 
initiative.  To think this tottering old-woman ridden Empire should 
dare to waste a man on such a score!  You say I ought to be 
penitent--"
<P>
Britten shook his head and smiled very faintly.
<P>
"I'm boiling with indignation," I said.  " I lay in bed last night 
and went through it all.  What in God's name was to be expected of 
us but what has happened?  I went through my life bit by bit last 
night, I recalled all I've had to do with virtue and women, and all 
I was told and how I was prepared.  I was born into cowardice and 
debasement.  We all are.  Our generation's grimy with hypocrisy.  I 
came to the most beautiful things in life--like peeping Tom of 
Coventry.  I was never given a light, never given a touch of natural 
manhood by all this dingy, furtive, canting, humbugging English 
world.  Thank God! I'll soon be out of it!  The shame of it!  The 
very savages in Australia initiate their children better than the 
English do to-day.  Neither of us was ever given a view of what they 
call morality that didn't make it show as shabby subservience, as 
the meanest discretion, an abject submission to unreasonable 
prohibitions! meek surrender of mind and body to the dictation of 
pedants and old women and fools.  We weren't taught--we were mumbled 
at!  And when we found that the thing they called unclean, unclean, 
was Pagan beauty--God! it was a glory to sin, Britten, it was a 
pride and splendour like bathing in the sunlight after dust and 
grime!"
<P>
"Yes," said Britten.  "That's all very well--"
<P>
I interrupted him.  "I know there's a case--I'm beginning to think 
it a valid case against us; but we never met it!  There's a steely 
pride in self restraint,  a nobility of chastity, but only for those 
who see and think and act--untrammeled and unafraid.  The other 
thing, the current thing, why! it's worth as much as the chastity of 
a monkey kept in a cage by itself!"  I put my foot in a chair, and 
urged my case upon him.  "This is a dirty world, Britten, simply 
because it is a muddled world, and the thing you call morality is 
dirtier now than the thing you call immorality.  Why don't the 
moralists pick their stuff out of the slime if they care for it, and 
wipe it?--damn them!  I am burning now to say: 'Yes, we did this and 
this,' to all the world.  All the world! . . .  I will!"
<P>
Britten rubbed the palm of his hand on the corner of his desk.  
"That's all very well, Remington," he said.  "You mean to go."
<P>
He stopped and began again.  "If you didn't know you were in the 
wrong you wouldn't be so damned rhetorical.  You're in the wrong.  
It's as plain to you as it is to me.  You're leaving a big work, 
you're leaving a wife who trusted you, to go and live with your 
jolly mistress. . . .  You won't see you're a statesman that 
matters, that no single man, maybe, might come to such influence as 
you in the next ten years.  You're throwing yourself away and 
accusing your country of rejecting you."
<P>
He swung round upon his swivel at me.  "Remington," he said, "have 
you forgotten the immense things our movement means?"
<P>
I thought.  "Perhaps I am rhetorical," I said.
<P>
"But the things we might achieve!  If you'd only stay now--even now!  
Oh! you'd suffer a little socially, but what of that?  You'd be able 
to go on--perhaps all the better for hostility of the kind you'd 
get.  You know, Remington--you KNOW."
<P>
I thought and went back to his earlier point.  "If I am rhetorical, 
at any rate it's a living feeling behind it.  Yes, I remember all 
the implications of our aims--very splendid, very remote.  But just 
now it's rather like offering to give a freezing man the sunlit 
Himalayas from end to end in return for his camp-fire.  When you 
talk of me and my jolly mistress, it isn't fair.  That misrepresents 
everything.  I'm not going out of this--for delights.  That's the 
sort of thing men like Snuffles and Keyhole imagine--that excites 
them!  When I think of the things these creatures think!  Ugh!  But 
YOU know better?  You know that physical passion that burns like a 
fire--ends clean.  I'm going for love, Britten--if I sinned for 
passion.  I'm going, Britten, because when I saw her the other day 
she HURT me.  She hurt me damnably, Britten. . . .  I've been a cold 
man--I've led a rhetorical life--you hit me with that word!--I put 
things in a windy way, I know, but what has got hold of me at last 
is her pain.  She's ill.  Don't you understand?  She's a sick thing--
a weak thing.  She's no more a goddess than I'm a god. . . .  I'm 
not in love with her now; I'm RAW with love for her.  I feel like a 
man that's been flayed.  I have been flayed. . . .  You don't begin 
to imagine the sort of helpless solicitude. . . .  She's not going 
to do things easily; she's ill.  Her courage fails. . . .  It's hard 
to put things when one isn't rhetorical, but it's this, Britten--
there are distresses that matter more than all the delights or 
achievements in the world. . . .  I made her what she is--as I never 
made Margaret.  I've made her--I've broken her. . . .  I'm going 
with my own woman.  The rest of my life and England, and so forth, 
must square itself to that. . . ."
<P>
For a long time, as it seemed, we remained silent and motionless.  
We'd said all we had to say.  My eyes caught a printed slip upon the 
desk before him, and I came back abruptly to the paper.
<P>
I picked up this galley proof.  It was one of Winter's essays.  
"This man goes on doing first-rate stuff," I said.  "I hope you will 
keep him going."
<P>
He did not answer for a moment or so.  "I'll keep him going," he 
said at last with a sigh.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
I have a letter Margaret wrote me within a week of our flight.  I 
cannot resist transcribing some of it here, because it lights things 
as no word of mine can do.  It is a string of nearly inconsecutive 
thoughts written in pencil in a fine, tall, sprawling hand.  Its 
very inconsecutiveness is essential.  Many words are underlined.  It 
was in answer to one from me; but what I wrote has passed utterly 
from my mind. . . .
<P>
"Certainly," she says, "I want to hear from you, but I do not want 
to see you.  There's a sort of abstract YOU that I want to go on 
with.  Something I've made out of you. . . .  I want to know things 
about you--but I don't want to see or feel or imagine.  When some 
day I have got rid of my intolerable sense of proprietorship, it may 
be different.  Then perhaps we may meet again.  I think it is even 
more the loss of our political work and dreams that I am feeling 
than the loss of your presence.  Aching loss.  I thought so much of 
the things we were DOING for the world--had given myself so 
unreservedly.  You've left me with nothing to DO.  I am suddenly at 
loose ends. . . .
<P>
"We women are trained to be so dependent on a man.  I've got no life 
of my own at all.  It seems now to me that I wore my clothes even 
for you and your schemes. . . .
<P>
"After I have told myself a hundred times why this has happened, I 
ask again, 'Why did he give things up?  Why did he give things 
up?' . . .
<P>
"It is just as though you were wilfully dead. . . .
<P>
"Then I ask again and again whether this thing need have happened at 
all, whether if I had had a warning, if I had understood better, I 
might not have adapted myself to your restless mind and made this 
catastrophe impossible. . . .
<P>
"Oh, my dear! why hadn't you the pluck to hurt me at the beginning, 
and tell me what you thought of me and life?  You didn't give me a 
chance; not a chance.  I suppose you couldn't.  All these things you 
and I stood away from.  You let my first repugnances repel you. . . .
<P>
"It is strange to think after all these years that I should be 
asking myself, do I love you? have I loved you?  In a sense I think 
I HATE you.  I feel you have taken my life, dragged it in your wake 
for a time, thrown it aside.  I am resentful.  Unfairly resentful, 
for why should I exact that you should watch and understand my life, 
when clearly I have understood so little of yours.  But I am savage--
savage at the wrecking of all you were to do.
<P>
"Oh, why--why did you give things up?
<P>
"No human being is his own to do what he likes with.  You were not 
only pledged to my tiresome, ineffectual companionship, but to great 
purposes.  They ARE great purposes. . . .
<P>
"If only I could take up your work as you leave it, with the 
strength you had--then indeed I feel I could let you go--you and 
your young mistress. . . .  All that matters so little to me. . . .
<P>
"Yet I think I must indeed love you yourself in my slower way.  At 
times I am mad with jealousy at the thought of all I hadn't the wit 
to give you. . . .  I've always hidden my tears from you--and what 
was in my heart.  It's my nature to hide--and you, you want things 
brought to you to see.  You are so curious as to be almost cruel.  
You don't understand reserves.  You have no mercy with restraints 
and reservations.  You arc not really a CIVILISED man at all.  You 
hate pretences--and not only pretences but decent coverings. . . .
<P>
"It's only after one has lost love and the chance of loving that 
slow people like myself find what they might have done.  Why wasn't 
I bold and reckless and abandoned?  It's as reasonable to ask that, 
I suppose, as to ask why my hair is fair. . . .
<P>
"I go on with these perhapses over and over again here when I find 
myself alone. . . .
<P>
"My dear, my dear, you can't think of the desolation of things--I 
shall never go back to that house we furnished together, that was to 
have been the laboratory (do you remember calling it a laboratory?) 
in which you were to forge so much of the new order. . . .
<P>
"But, dear, if I can help you--even now--in any way--help both of 
you, I mean. . . .  It tears me when I think of you poor and 
discredited.  You will let me help you if I can--it will be the last 
wrong not to let me do that. . . .
<P>
"You had better not get ill.  If you do, and I hear of it--I shall 
come after you with a troupe of doctor's and nurses.  If I am a 
failure as a wife, no one has ever said I was anything but a success 
as a district visitor. . . ."
<P>
There are other sheets, but I cannot tell whether they were written 
before or after the ones from which I have quoted.  And most of them 
have little things too intimate to set down.  But this oddly 
penetrating analysis of our differences must, I think, be given.
<P>
"There are all sorts of things I can't express about this and want 
to.  There's this difference that has always been between us, that 
you like nakedness and wildness, and I, clothing and restraint.  It 
goes through everything.  You are always TALKING of order and 
system, and the splendid dream of the order that might replace the 
muddled system you hate, but by a sort of instinct you seem to want 
to break the law.  I've watched you so closely.  Now I want to obey 
laws, to make sacrifices, to follow rules.  I don't want to make, 
but I do want to keep.  You are at once makers and rebels, you and 
Isabel too.  You're bad people--criminal people, I feel, and yet 
full of something the world must have.  You're so much better than 
me, and so much viler.  It may be there is no making without 
destruction, but it seems to me sometimes that it is nothing but an 
instinct for lawlessness that drives you.  You remind me--do you 
remember?--of that time we went from Naples to Vesuvius, and walked 
over the hot new lava there.  Do you remember how tired I was?  I 
know it disappointed you that I was tired.  One walked there in 
spite of the heat because there was a crust; like custom, like law.  
But directly a crust forms on things, you are restless to break down 
to the fire again.  You talk of beauty, both of you, as something 
terrible, mysterious, imperative.  YOUR beauty is something 
altogether different from anything I know or feel.  It has pain in 
it.  Yet you always speak as though it was something I ought to feel 
and am dishonest not to feel.  MY beauty is a quiet thing.  You have 
always laughed at my feeling for old-fashioned chintz and blue china 
and Sheraton.  But I like all these familiar USED things.  My beauty 
is STILL beauty, and yours, is excitement.  I know nothing of the 
fascination of the fire, or why one should go deliberately out of 
all the decent fine things of life to run dangers and be singed and 
tormented and destroyed.  I don't understand. . . ."

I remember very freshly the mood of our departure from London, the 
platform of Charing Cross with the big illuminated clock overhead, 
the bustle of porters and passengers with luggage, the shouting of 
newsboys and boys with flowers and sweets, and the groups of friends 
seeing travellers off by the boat train.  Isabel sat very quiet and 
still in the compartment, and I stood upon the platform with the 
door open, with a curious reluctance to take the last step that 
should sever me from London's ground.  I showed our tickets, and 
bought a handful of red roses for her.  At last came the guards 
crying: "Take your seats," and I got in and closed the door on me.  
We had, thank Heaven! a compartment to ourselves.  I let down the 
window and stared out.
<P>
There was a bustle of final adieux on the platform, a cry of "Stand 
away, please, stand away!" and the train was gliding slowly and 
smoothly out of the station.
<P>
I looked out upon the river as the train rumbled with slowly 
gathering pace across the bridge, and the bobbing black heads of the 
pedestrians in the footway, and the curve of the river and the 
glowing great hotels, and the lights and reflections and blacknesses 
of that old, familiar spectacle.  Then with a common thought, we 
turned our eyes westward to where the pinnacles of Westminster and 
the shining clock tower rose hard and clear against the still, 
luminous sky.
<P>
"They'll be in Committee on the Reformatory Bill to-night," I said, 
a little stupidly.
<P>
"And so," I added, "good-bye to London!"
<P>
We said no more, but watched the south-side streets below--bright 
gleams of lights and movement, and the dark, dim, monstrous shapes 
of houses and factories.  We ran through Waterloo Station, London 
Bridge, New Cross, St. John's.  We said never a word.  It seemed to 
me that for a time we had exhausted our emotions.  We had escaped, 
we had cut our knot, we had accepted the last penalty of that 
headlong return of mine from Chicago a year and a half ago.  That 
was all settled.  That harvest of feelings we had reaped.  I thought 
now only of London, of London as the symbol of all we were leaving 
and all we had lost in the world.  I felt nothing now but an 
enormous and overwhelming regret. . . .
<P>
The train swayed and rattled on its way.  We ran through old 
Bromstead, where once I had played with cities and armies on the 
nursery floor.  The sprawling suburbs with their scattered lights 
gave way to dim tree-set country under a cloud-veiled, 
intermittently shining moon.  We passed Cardcaster Place.  Perhaps 
old Wardingham, that pillar of the old Conservatives, was there, 
fretting over his unsuccessful struggle with our young Toryism.  
Little he recked of this new turn of the wheel and how it would 
confirm his contempt of all our novelties.  Perhaps some faint 
intimation drew him to the window to see behind the stems of the 
young fir trees that bordered his domain, the little string of 
lighted carriage windows gliding southward. . . .
<P>
Suddenly I began to realise just what it was we were doing.
<P>
And now, indeed, I knew what London had been to me, London where I 
had been born and educated, the slovenly mother of my mind and all 
my ambitions, London and the empire!  It seemed to me we must be 
going out to a world that was utterly empty.  All our significance 
fell from us--and before us was no meaning any more.  We were 
leaving London; my hand, which had gripped so hungrily upon its 
complex life, had been forced from it, my fingers left their hold.  
That was over.  I should never have a voice in public affairs again.  
The inexorable unwritten law which forbids overt scandal sentenced 
me.  We were going out to a new life, a life that appeared in that 
moment to be a mere shrivelled remnant of me, a mere residuum of 
sheltering and feeding and seeing amidst alien scenery and the sound 
of unfamiliar tongues.  We were going to live cheaply in a foreign 
place, so cut off that I meet now the merest stray tourist, the 
commonest tweed-clad stranger with a mixture of shyness and hunger. . . .  
And suddenly all the schemes I was leaving appeared fine and 
adventurous and hopeful as they had never done before.  How great 
was this purpose I had relinquished, this bold and subtle remaking 
of the English will!  I had doubted so many things, and now suddenly 
I doubted my unimportance, doubted my right to this suicidal 
abandonment.  Was I not a trusted messenger, greatly trusted and 
favoured, who had turned aside by the way?  Had I not, after all, 
stood for far more than I had thought; was I not filching from that 
dear great city of my birth and life, some vitally necessary thing, 
a key, a link, a reconciling clue in her political development, that 
now she might seek vaguely for in vain?  What is one life against 
the State?  Ought I not to have sacrificed Isabel and all my passion 
and sorrow for Isabel, and held to my thing--stuck to my thing?
<P>
I heard as though he had spoken it in the carriage Britten's "It WAS 
a good game.  No end of a game.  And for the first time I imagined 
the faces and voices of Crupp and Esmeer and Gane when they learnt 
of this secret flight, this flight of which they were quite 
unwarned.  And Shoesmith might he there in the house,--Shoesmith who 
was to have been married in four days--the thing might hit him full 
in front of any kind of people.  Cruel eyes might watch him.  Why 
the devil hadn't I written letters to warn them all?  I could have 
posted them five minutes before the train started.  I had never 
thought to that moment of the immense mess they would be in; how the 
whole edifice would clatter about their ears.  I had a sudden desire 
to stop the train and go back for a day, for two days, to set that 
negligence right.  My brain for a moment brightened, became animated 
and prolific of ideas.  I thought of a brilliant line we might have 
taken on that confounded Reformatory Bill. . . .
<P>
That sort of thing was over. . . .
<P>
What indeed wasn't over?  I passed to a vaguer, more multitudinous 
perception of disaster, the friends I had lost already since Altiora 
began her campaign, the ampler remnant whom now I must lose.  I 
thought of people I had been merry with, people I had worked with 
and played with, the companions of talkative walks, the hostesses of 
houses that had once glowed with welcome for us both.  I perceived 
we must lose them all.  I saw life like a tree in late autumn that 
had once been rich and splendid with friends--and now the last brave 
dears would be hanging on doubtfully against the frosty chill of 
facts, twisting and tortured in the universal gale of indignation, 
trying to evade the cold blast of the truth.  I had betrayed my 
party, my intimate friend, my wife, the wife whose devotion had made 
me what I was.  For awhile the figure of Margaret, remote, wounded, 
shamed, dominated my mind, and the thought of my immense 
ingratitude.  Damn them! they'd take it out of her too.  I had a 
feeling that I wanted to go straight back and grip some one by the 
throat, some one talking ill of Margaret.  They'd blame her for not 
keeping me, for letting things go so far. . . .  I wanted the whole 
world to know how fine she was.  I saw in imagination the busy, 
excited dinner tables at work upon us all, rather pleasantly 
excited, brightly indignant, merciless.
<P>
Well, it's the stuff we are! . . .
<P>
Then suddenly, stabbing me to the heart, came a vision of Margaret's 
tears and the sound of her voice saying, "Husband mine! Oh! husband 
mine!  To see you cry!" . . .
<P>
I came out of a cloud of thoughts to discover the narrow 
compartment, with its feeble lamp overhead, and our rugs and hand-
baggage swaying on the rack, and Isabel, very still in front of me, 
gripping my wilting red roses tightly in her bare and ringless hand.
<P>
For a moment I could not understand her attitude, and then I 
perceived she was sitting bent together with her head averted from 
the light to hide the tears that were streaming down her face.  She 
had not got her handkerchief out for fear that I should see this, 
but I saw her tears, dark drops of tears, upon her sleeve. . . .
<P>
I suppose she had been watching my expression, divining my thoughts.
<P>
For a time I stared at her and was motionless, in a sort of still 
and weary amazement.  Why had we done this injury to one another?  
WHY?  Then something stirred within me.
<P>
"ISABEL!" I whispered.
<P>
She made no sign.
<P>
"Isabel!" I repeated, and then crossed over to her and crept closely 
to her, put my arm about her, and drew her wet cheek to mine.
