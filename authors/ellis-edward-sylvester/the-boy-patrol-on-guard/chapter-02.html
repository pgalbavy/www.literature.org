<p>At Boothbay Harbor, Mike Murphy hired Sherb Doloff to take him
in his small motor boat <em>Sunshine</em> to Hailstone Point.
It was the season when the days are long, and the sun was only
a little past meridian as the small boat chug-chugged up beside
the projecting finger of land and the eager Mike leaped ashore.</p>

<p>"There isn’t any path on this side of the point," said Captain
Doloff, "but you can’t miss your way. A few miles through the
woods and you’ll be there."</p>

<p>"Have no worriment for me; I’m not the bye to go astray, even
if the country <em>is</em> new," was the confident reply of Mike,
who, having paid the young man the fee agreed upon, bade him good-by
and plunged into the fragrant pine forest. He carried no firearms,
not even his revolver,—a fact which caused him no misgiving, since
it seemed impossible that he should run into any personal danger.
This was not the section of Maine frequented by wild animals,
and though there were a few Indians, here and there, all were
civilized and they attract no more interest than those of the
Caucasian race. A tramp of several miles on such a balmy day was
enjoyable when there was just a tinge of crispness in the air
to remind one that autumn was only a few weeks away. The pine
cones and moss, and the many years’ accumulation of decaying foliage
formed a spongy carpet, upon which the shoe pressed without giving
back any sound, and made walking the pleasantest sort of gentle
exercise.</p>

<p>Mike carried the heavy buckthorn cane which his father had brought
with him from Ireland, but he did not need its aid. He twirled
it as an officer dallies with his swagger stick and sang snatches
of song in that wonderfully sweet voice, which no one could hear
without being charmed. Of course it was impossible for the lad
to be unaware of his amazing gift in this respect, and you have
been told of some of the occasions when he used it for the delight
of others. He frequently sang for his father and mother, and again,
as in the present instance, the low delightful humming was for
his own pleasure, since one of the blessed peculiarities of music
is that it requires no "witnesses" for its perfect enjoyment.</p>

<p>Still, as has also been shown, Mike was never forward in displaying
his unrivaled voice. Many a time he had listened to the singing
of others and joined in the applause without a single one of the
audience suspecting how infinitely superior he was to the foremost
of the company, nor did Mike ever enlighten them.</p>

<p>With all his waggishness and pugnacity, he was devout in his
religious belief and had won the commendation more than once of
the priests at home, who knew all about him.</p>

<p>"I wonder why the Lord is so good to me," he reflected with reverent
emotion; "there ain’t a meaner rapscallion in creation than me,
and yet He treats me as if I were a twin brother to Alvin and
Chester and lots of other folks. I must try to remember all this,
but I’m sartin to furget it on the first chance that comes to
me.</p>

<p>"Now, about those Boy Scouts,—I wonder what they are; I never
heard of ’em before; I s’pose they call themselves Scouts ’cause
they’re always scouting for a row, and kick up a shindy whenever
they git the chance. I’ll try to do me part, as I always did in
the owld country, and since I set fut in Ameriky."</p>

<p>Giving rein to his mental whimsies, Mike strolled forward until
certain he had traveled the full distance. He halted and looked
around. Several times a half dozen crows, perched in the treetops,
catching sight of him dived away with loud cawing warnings to
their comrades of an intrusion into their domain of a foe to be
feared, but thus far he had noted no other species of birds. Now,
however, when he peered upward through an opening among the branches,
he saw a black speck gliding across the thin azure and vanishing
in the ocean of ether beyond. It was an eagle, soaring so far
aloft that its piercing vision had no knowledge of the tiny form
thousands of feet below amid the firs and pines.</p>

<p>"Gosling Lake," repeated Mike; "I must be near the same, as dad
remarked whin his friend Jim Muldoon cracked his head wid the
shillalah, but I obsarve it not."</p>

<p>He listened keenly but caught no distinctive sound. The soft,
almost inaudible murmur which is never absent in a wide stretch
of forest, or when miles inland from the breathing ocean, brooded
in the air and has been called the "voice of silence" itself.</p>

<p>Thus far the youth had not felt the slightest misgiving, and
even now he was sure there was no cause for alarm. If he was astray
it could not be for long. He was not far from some of the numerous
towns and villages in that section, and if he could not find the
Boy Patrol camp, he surely would not have to search far before
coming upon friends. If the waning afternoon should find him in
the woods, it would be no special hardship to pass the night under
the trees, though he did not fancy the prospect and did not mean
to stay out unless necessity compelled.</p>

<p>None the less it dawned upon him for the first time that his
task was not likely to be as easy as he had supposed. Only an
experienced woodsman can hold to a mathematical line in the trackless
wilderness, which was what he must do to reach the camp of the
Boy Patrol.</p>

<p>"It would be no task if there was a path or road, and I was sitting
in an automobile, wid me hand on the steering gear or directing
the <em>Deerfut</em> up the Kennebec, or if them byes had put
up guide posts, which the same I’ll remind them to do."</p>

<p>If there was one thing regarding which Mike felt certain it was
that he had kept to a straight course after stepping ashore from
the launch; but if such were the fact, how could it be explained
that he had traveled all of this distance, and yet, so far as
appearances went, was as far from his goal as when he started?</p>

<p>"It’s more than I can understand, as Maggie Keile said when her
taycher told her ‘queue’ spelled ‘q.’ Now, if I could come upon
the tracks of some person it would be all that I could ask—and
begorra! here they be!"</p>

<p>Looking down at the ground, his eyes rested upon the very thing
he wished to see: there was the impression visible in the soft
leaves. Scarcely a rod from where he was standing was a yielding
patch of moss where the trail showed with clearness. The outline
of the broad sole of a shoe could be plainly traced until it became
more obscure on the drier leaves. Mike stepped nearer and studied
the "signs."</p>

<p>"Now, that felly knowed where he wanted to go, and not being
such a fool as me, he’s gone there. All I have to do is to keep
to the course he took and I’ll come out somewhere. I’ll stick
close, as the fly paper said to me whin I sat down on it."</p>

<p>Not doubting that he had found the key to the problem, all anxiety
vanished. It was not to be supposed that the individual who had
preceded him was ignorant of the woods and the quickest ways of
emerging from them. Mike even figured on coming upon him with
the appearance of accident, and of keeping from him his own need
of assistance in going to the Boy Patrol camp.</p>

<p>"It may be they’ve been here so short a time that he hasn’t obsarved
the same, but Gosling Lake has been in these parts a good many
years, and he’ll be sure to know where it is. I’ll draw it out
of him as if I don’t care much."</p>

<p>The youth had not forgotten that simplest of all expedients which
is the first to come to an astray person. This was to shout at
the top of his voice. More than likely he would be heard at the
Boy Scout camp, and if not there, by the stranger whom he was
trailing. But he was not ready to admit that he really needed
help, and to ask for assistance would be a confession that he
was frightened for his own safety. He would be ashamed to appear
in such a plight, and Alvin and Chester would be sure to make
the most of it. What more humiliating than to be introduced to
a lot of strangers as one who did not know enough to travel a
few miles through the woods without some person to lead him by
the hand?</p>

<p>"Not yet," he muttered, compressing his lips with resolve. "I
wonder whether them Boy Scouts can tell by looking at a person’s
footprints whether they were made an hour or a month ago. Howsumiver,
I don’t see that it makes any difference here. He must have gone
this way sometime and all I have to do is to folly him till I
come upon him or the place where he wint, which will sarve as
well."</p>

<p>Less than half an hour later, the trailer abruptly halted with
another wondering exclamation. Again he had come upon a velvety
bed of moss, where he looked upon the imprint, not of one pair
but of two pairs of shoes. They were side by side, with one set
of impressions as distinct as the other, and all looking so much
alike that Mike was struck with an absurd fancy.</p>

<p>"It can’t be that the man has growed four legs or is creeping
along with shoes on his hands as well as his faat. Each print
looks more like the others than it does like itself——"</p>

<p>A shiver ran down his spine and he gasped. He recoiled a step,
scrutinized the footprints, and then advanced and compared them
with what he had first come upon.</p>

<p>"Begorra! it was mesilf that made ’em all!"</p>

<p>It was the astounding truth. He was trailing himself. Instead
of moving in a straight line as he believed he had been doing
from the first, he had been walking—at least during the latter
part of his tramp—in a circle. You know that when a person is
lost in a trackless waste he is almost sure to do this, unless
he is a master of woodcraft or uses the utmost precaution against
going astray.</p>

<p>Many explanations of this peculiar tendency have been given,
but it is probably due to the fact that one side of every man
and woman is more developed and stronger than the other. A right-handed
man is more powerful on that side, and the reverse is the case
with a left-handed person. Very few are ambidextrous. We unconsciously
allow for this condition in our daily walks and movements, since
we are surrounded by landmarks as may be said; but when these
aids are removed, we are swayed by the muscles on one side more
than by those on the other. A right-handed person unconsciously
verges to the left, while the left-handed one does the opposite.
The impulse being uniform, even if slight, his course naturally
assumes the form of a circle.</p>

<p>It was hardly to be expected that Mike Murphy should reason out
this explanation, for he had never before experienced anything
of the kind. So far as woodcraft was concerned he could not have
been more ignorant. He removed his hat, ran his fingers through
his abundant red hair and laughed, for he could not close his
eyes to the comical absurdity of it all.</p>

<p>"It’s a mighty qu’ar slip, as me cousin said whin he started
to go up stairs and bumped down cellar, and be the same token
Mike Murphy is lost to that extent in these Maine woods that he’ll
niver find his way out till some one takes his hand and leads
him like a blind beggar.</p>

<p>"There must be some plan to figger the thing out," he added,
as he replaced his hat. "I’ve heerd that there be many signs that
do guide one when he’s off the track. Alvin once told me he had
heard an old hunter say that there’s more bark on one side of
a tree than the ither, but I disremember whether it was the east
or west or north or south side, and I can’t strip off the bark
to measure it, so that idea will do me no good. Then I’ve heerd
that the tops of some of the trees dip the most toward a certain
p’int of the compass, but I don’t mind me whether the same are
apple trees or pear trees or some ither kind, and which is the
side they nod their heads on. Ah, why did I forgit it?"</p>

<p>He drew forth his small mariner’s compass and eagerly studied
the dancing needle.</p>

<p>"That little finger ought to p’int to the north, but it don’t!"
he added disgustedly, noting that the flickering bit of steel,
instead of indicating the ornamented "N," fixed upon the "<em>SSW"
</em>almost opposite. He did not know that the needle is always
"true to the Pole," and that all he had to do was to shift the
case around so as to make it correspond. It was beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p>His only recourse—if it should prove a recourse—was to call for
help. Peering around among the shaggy columns of bark, without
seeing the first sign of life, he shouted in the voice which,
clear as the tone of a Stradivarius violin, penetrated farther
than even he supposed among the forest arches:</p>

<p>"Hello!"</p>

<p>He was thrilled almost instantly by the welcome reply:</p>

<p>"Hello!" </p>
