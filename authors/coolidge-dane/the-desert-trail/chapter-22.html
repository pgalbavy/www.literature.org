<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The superintendent's house stood on a low bench above the town, looking
out over all the valley, but protected by a high hill behind, upon the
summit of which was placed a mammoth black water-tank.
</p><p>In its architecture the <u>casa grande</u> was an exact replica of a
hot-country <u>hacienda</u>, a flat-roofed, one-storied square of adobe
bricks, whitewashed to keep off the sun and presenting on three
sides nothing but the dead walls of house and garden, with dense
trees planted near for shade. Along the front was a long arcade, the
<u>corredor</u>, graced by a series of massive arches which let in the light
and air. Inside were low chambers and long passages; and, behind, the
<u>patio</u> and garden of orange and fig trees.
</p><p>Built for a sumptuous dwelling, it became in a moment a fort and, with
men on the high hill by the tank, it was practically impregnable to
direct assault.
</p><p>As Hooker stepped out onto the covered porch with his saddle-gun in
his hand he became simply one more of a band of excited Americans, all
armed and ready to defend the house to the last. Some were pacing back
and forth in the <u>corredor</u>, others were hurrying up from the Mexican
quarters with a last belated handful of women, but the major portion
were out on the open bench, either gazing north and south at the
scenes of the distant firing or engaging in a curio-mad scramble for
any spent bullet that struck.
</p><p>The fighting, such as there was, was mostly up the cañon, where a
large party of Sonoran miners had rushed in pursuit of the rebels. The
firing down the cañon in the direction of Old Fortuna had died away
to nothing, and for the moment if seemed as if the futile charge and
retreat were the beginning and the end of the battle.
</p><p>A party of rebels had penetrated clear into the town, but it was
apparently more by accident than intention, and they had been quick
to beat a retreat. As for the main command of the <u>insurrectos</u>, they
were reported at Chular, six miles up the railroad, where they had
surrounded and taken a small mining camp and captured a train at the
summit.
</p><p>The column to the south--the one which Hooker had encountered--had
taken to the high hills west of the town, and, along the sky-line of
the buttelike summits, they could now be seen in scattered bands making
their way to the north.
</p><p>The defenders of Fortuna consisted of a rag-tag garrison of twenty
Federals and the hot-headed, charging miners. But apparently that was a
combination hard to beat, for, while the Federals entrenched themselves
behind the black tank on the hill and prepared to protect the town, the
Sonorans in shouting masses drove everything before them and marched on
to attack Chular.
</p><p>But in this they made a mistake, for the rebel scouts, seeing the
great body of defenders pressing on up the narrow cañon, rode back and
informed the tricky Bernardo Bravo. He would be a poor general indeed
who could not see the opening that was offered and, while the valiant
Sonorans pursued the rebel cavalry up the pass, Bernardo Bravo sent the
half of his thousand men to cut off their retreat from behind.
</p><p>Along the broad top of the mountain above they came scampering by tens
and twenties, closing in with a vastly superior force upon the now
defenseless town. In the depths of the cañon below the miners were
still chasing the elusive cavalry, their firing becoming faint as they
clambered on toward the summit and the rebel headquarters at Chular.
</p><p>They had, in fact, been handled like children, and the Americans joined
in contemptuous curses of their mistaken bravery as they beheld in what
straits it had left them.
</p><p>Forbidden by the superintendent to participate in the combat, yet
having in their care the women of the camp, they were compelled to
stand passively aside while rebels by the hundred came charging down
the ridges. Only in the last resort, and when all diplomacy and Federal
defense had failed, would they be allowed to so much as cock a rifle.
And yet--well, twenty determined Americans might easily turn back this
charge.
</p><p>Taking advantage of his Mexican citizenship, Hooker was already on the
run for the trenches when the superintendent stopped him with a look.
</p><p>"Let the Mexicans fight it out," he said. "They might resent it if you
took sides, and that would make it bad for us. Just wait a while--you
never can tell what will happen. Perhaps the <u>rurales</u> and Federals
will stand them off."
</p><p>"What, that little bunch?" demanded Bud, pointing scornfully at the
handful of defenders who were cowering behind their rock-piles. "Why,
half of them <u>pelónes</u> don't know what a gun was made for, and the
<u>rurales</u>--"
</p><p>"Well, the rebels are the same," suggested the superintendent
pacifically. "Let them fight it out--we need every American we can get,
so just forget about being a Mexican."
</p><p>"All right," agreed Bud, as he yielded reluctantly to reason. "It ain't
because I'm a Mexican citizen--I just want to stop that rush."
</p><p>He walked back to the house, juggling his useless gun and keeping his
eye on the distant ridges. And then, in a chorus of defiant yells, the
men in the Federal trenches began to shoot.
</p><p>In an air-line the distance was something over a mile, but at the first
scattering volley the rebels halted and fired a volley in return. With
a vicious <u>spang</u> a few stray bullets smashed against the reverberating
steel tank, but no one was hurt, and the defenders, drunk with valor,
began to shoot and yell like mad.
</p><p>The bullets of the rebels, fired at random, struck up dust-jets in
every direction, and from the lower part of the town came the shouting
of the non-combatant Mexicans as they ran here and there for shelter.
But by the trenches, and in the rear of the black tank, the great
crowd of onlookers persisted, ducking as each successive bullet hit the
tank and shouting encouragement as the defenders emptied their rifles
and reloaded with clip after clip.
</p><p>The rifles rattled a continuous volley; spent bullets leaped like
locusts across the flat; men ran to and fro, now crouching behind the
tank, now stepping boldly into the open; and the defiant shouts of the
defenders almost drowned the wails of the women. Except for one thing
it was a battle--there was nobody hurt.
</p><p>For the first half-hour the Americans stayed prudently under cover,
busying themselves at the suggestion of a few American women in
providing a first-aid hospital on the sheltered porch. Then, as no
wounded came to fill it and the rebels delayed their charge, one man
after another climbed up to the trenches, ostensibly to bring down the
injured.
</p><p>As soldiers and bystanders reported no one hit, and the bullets flew
harmlessly past, their solicitude turned rapidly to disgust and then to
scorn. Strange as it may seem, they were disappointed at the results,
and their remarks were derogatory as they commented on the bravery of
<u>pelónes</u> and Mexicans in general.
</p><p>From a dread of imminent attack, of charging rebels and retreating
defenders, and a fight to the death by the house, they came suddenly
to a desire for blood and battle, for dead men and the cries of the
wounded; and all fear of the <u>insurrectos</u> left them.
</p><p>"Come away, boys," grunted the burly roadmaster, who up to then had
led in the work; "we wasted our time on that hospital--there'll be no
wounded. Let's take ourselves back to the house and have a quiet smoke."
</p><p>"Right you are, Ed," agreed the master mechanic, as he turned upon his
heel in disgust. "This ain't war--them Mexicans think they're working
for a moving-picture show!"
</p><p>"I bet you I can go up on that ridge," announced Hooker, "and clean out
the whole bunch with my six-shooter before you could bat your eye."
</p><p>But the superintendent was not so sure.
</p><p>"Never mind, boys," he said. "We're worth a lot of ransom money to
those rebels and they won't give up so quick. And look at this now--my
miners coming back! Those are the boys that will fight! Wait till Chico
and Ramon Mendoza get after them!"
</p><p>He pointed as he spoke to a straggling band of Sonorans, led by the
much-vaunted Mendoza brothers, as they hurried to save the town, and a
cheer went up from the trenches as the Federals beheld reenforcements.
But a change had come over the fire-eating miners, and they brought
other rebels in their wake.
</p><p>As they trudged wearily into town and sought shelter among the houses
a great body of men appeared on the opposite ridge, firing down at
them as they retreated. The battle rapidly turned into a long-distance
shooting contest, with the rebels on the ridges and the defenders in
the valley, and finally, as the day wore on and a thunderstorm came
up, it died out altogether and the rebels turned back to their camp.
</p><p>Except for one lone Federal who had shot himself by accident there was
not a single defender hurt, and if the enemy had suffered losses it was
only by some such chance. But when the Sonoran patriots, holding up
their empty belts, came clamoring for ammunition, the men by the big
house took in the real catastrophe of the battle.
</p><p>Seventeen thousand rounds of the precious thirty-thirties had been
delivered to the excited miners and now, except for what few the
Americans had saved, there was not a cartridge in camp. Very soberly
the superintendent assured the leaders that he had no more. They
pointed at the full belts of the American guard and demanded them as
their right; and when the Americans refused to yield they flew into a
rage and threatened.
</p><p>All in all, it was a pitiful exhibition of hot-headedness and
imbecility, and only the firmness of the superintendent prevented a
real spilling of blood. The Mexicans retired in a huff and broke into
the <u>cantina</u>, and as the night came on the valley re-echoed to their
drunken shoutings.
</p><p>Such was war as the Sonorans conceived it. When Hooker, standing his
guard in the <u>corredor</u>, encountered Gracia Aragon on her evening walk,
he could scarcely conceal a grin.
</p><p>"What are you laughing at, Señor Hooker?" she demanded with asperity.
"Is it so pleasant, with a houseful of frightened women and screaming
children, that you should make fun of our plight?"
</p><p>"No, indeed," apologized Bud; "nothing like that. Sure must be bad in
there--I stay outside myself. But I reckon it'll soon be over with.
The Mexicans here in town have shot off all their ammunition and I
reckon the rebels have done the same. Like as not they'll all be gone
to-morrow, and then you can go back home."
</p><p>"Oh, thank you for thinking about me!" she returned with a scornful
curl of the lip. "But if all men were as open as you, Mr. Hooker, we
women would never need to ask a question. This morning you told me I
did not know what I was talking about--now I presume you are thinking
what cowards the Mexicans are!
</p><p>"Oh, I know! You need not deny it! You are nothing but a great
big--<u>Tejano</u>! Yes, I was going to say 'brute,' but you are a friend
of dear Phil's, and so I will hold my tongue. If it wasn't for that,
I'd--" She paused, leaving him to guess.
</p><p>"Oh, I do wish he were here!" she breathed, leaning wearily against the
white pillar of an arch and gazing down through the long arcade.
</p><p>"It was so close in there," she continued, "I could not stand it a
minute longer. These Indian women, you know--they weep and moan all
the time. And the children--I am so sorry for them. I cannot go now,
because they need me; but to-morrow--if Phil were here--I would leave
and ride for the line.
</p><p>"Have you seen Del Rey to-day? No? Then all the better--he must be
policing the town. It is only of him I am afraid. These rebels are
nothing--I agree with you! No! I am not angry with you at all now! But
to-morrow, just at dusk, when all is still as it is at this time; then,
if Phil were here, I would mount my brave horse and ride out by the
western pass."
</p><p>She ended rather inconclusively, letting her voice trail off wistfully
as she waited for him to speak, but something within moved Hooker to
hold his peace, and he looked out over the town without commenting on
her plans. It was evident to him that she was determined to enlist
his sympathy and involve him in her wild plot, and each time the
conversation veered in that direction he took refuge in a stubborn
silence.
</p><p>"What are you thinking, Mr. Hooker?" she asked at last, as he gazed
into the dusk. "Sometimes I scold you and sometimes I try to please
you, but I never know what you think! I did not mean that when I said I
could read your thoughts--you are so different from poor, dear Phil!"
</p><p>"M-m-m," mumbled Bud, shifting his feet, and his face turned a little
grim.
</p><p>"Aha!" she cried with ill-concealed satisfaction, "you do not like me
to call him that, do you? 'Poor, dear Phil,'--like that! But do you
know why I do it? It is to punish you for never coming near me--when
I signed to you--when I waited for you--long ago! Ah, you were so
cruel! I wanted to know you--you were a cowboy, and I thought you were
brave enough to defend me--but you always rode right by. Yes, that was
it--but Phil was different! He came when I sent for him; he sang songs
to me at night; he took my part against Manuel del Rey; and now--"
</p><p>"Yes!" commented Bud bruskly, with his mind on "dear Phil's" finish,
and she turned to peer into his face.
</p><p>"So that is it!" she said. "You do not trust me. You think that I am
not your friend--that I will serve you as he was served. Is that what
you are thinking?"
</p><p>"Something like that," admitted Hooker, leaning lazily against the mud
wall. "Only I reckon I don't think just the way you do."
</p><p>"Why? How do I think?" she demanded eagerly.
</p><p>"Well, you think awful fast," answered Hooker slowly. "And you don't
always think the same, seems like. I'm kind of quiet myself, and I
don't like--well, I wouldn't say that, but you don't always mean what
you say."
</p><p>"Oh!" breathed Gracia, and then, after a pause, she came nearer and
leaned against the low wall beside him.
</p><p>"If I would speak from my heart," she asked, "if I would talk plain, as
you Americans do, would you like me better then? Would you talk to me
instead of standing silent? Listen, Bud--for that is your name--I want
you to be my friend the way you were a friend to Phil. I know what you
did for him, and how you bore with his love-madness--and that was my
fault, too. But partly it was also your fault, for you made me angry by
not coming.
</p><p>"Yes, I will be honest now--it was you that I wanted to know at
first, but you would not come, and now I am promised to Phil. He was
brave when you were careful, and my heart went out to him. You know
how it is with us Mexicans--we do not love by reason. We love like
children--suddenly--from the heart! And now all I wish in life is to
run away to Phil. But every time I speak of it you shut your jaws or
tell me I am a fool."
</p><p>"Ump-um," protested Bud, turning stubborn again. "I tell you you don't
know what you're talking about. These rebels don't amount to nothing
around the town, but on a trail they're awful. They shoot from behind
rocks and all that, and a woman ain't no ways safe. You must know what
they're like--these old women don't think about nothing else--so what's
the use of talking? And besides," he added grimly, "I've had some
trouble with your old man and don't want to have any more."
</p><p>"What trouble have you had?" she demanded promptly, but Hooker would
not answer in words. He only shrugged his shoulders and turned away,
crumpling his hat in his hand.
</p><p>"But no!" she cried as she sensed the meaning of his concealment, "you
must tell me! I want to know. Was it over your mine? Then you must not
blame me, for he never has told me a word!"
</p><p>"No?" inquired Bud, rousing suddenly at the memory of his wrongs. "Then
maybe you will tell me how he got <u>this</u>"--he fetched a worn piece of
ore from his pocket--"when my pardner gave it to <u>you</u>! It was right
there I lost my pardner--and he was a good kid, too--and all because of
that rock. Here, take a look at it--I took that away from your father!"
</p><p>"Then he stole it from me!" flashed back Gracia as she gazed at the
specimen. "Oh, have you thought all the time that I betrayed Phil? But
didn't I tell you--didn't I tell you at the hotel, when you promised
to be my friend? Ah, I see that you are a hard man, Mr. Hooker--quick
to suspect, slow to forget--and yet I told you before! But listen, and
I will tell you again. I remember well when dear Phil showed me this
rock--he was so happy because he had found the gold. And just to make
it lucky he let me hold it while we were talking through a hole in the
wall. Then my father saw me and started to come near--I could not hand
it back without betraying Phil--and in the night, when I was asleep,
some one took it from under my pillow. That is the truth, and I will
ask you to believe me; and if you have other things against me you must
say what they are and see if I cannot explain.
</p><p>"No!" she ran on, her voice vibrant with the memory of past quarrels.
"I have nothing to do with my father! He does not love me, but tries
to make me marry first one man and then another. But I am an American
girl now, at heart--I do not want to sell myself; I want to marry for
love! Can you understand that? Yes? No? Then why do you look away? Have
you something that you hold against me? Ah, you shake your head--but
you will not speak to me! When I was at school in Los Angeles I saw
the cowboys in the West show, and they were different--they were not
afraid of any danger, but they would talk, too. I have always wanted to
know you, but you will not let me--I thought you were brave--like those
cowboys."
</p><p>She paused to make him speak, but Hooker was tongue-tied. There was
something about the way she talked that pulled him over, that made him
want to do what she said, and yet some secret, hidden voice was always
crying: "Beware!" He was convinced now that she had never been a party
to treachery; no, nor even wished him ill.
</p><p>She was very beautiful, too, in the twilight, and when she drew nearer
he moved away, for he was afraid she would sway him from his purpose.
But now she was waiting for some answer--some word from him, though the
question had never been asked. And yet he knew what it was.
</p><p>She wanted him to steal away with her in the evening and ride for the
border--and Phil. That was what she always wanted, no matter what she
said, and now she was calling him a coward.
</p><p>"Sure them bronco-riders are brave," he said in vague defense; "but
there's a difference between being brave and foolish. And a man might
be brave for himself and yet be afraid for other people."
</p><p>"How do you mean?" she asked.
</p><p>"Well," he said, "I might be willing to go out and fight a thousand of
them <u>insurrectos</u> with one hand, and at the same time be afraid to
take you along. Or I might--"
</p><p>"Oh, then you <u>will</u> go, won't you?" she cried, clasping him by the
hand. "You will, won't you? I'm not afraid!"
</p><p>"No," answered Bud, drawing his hand away, "that's just what I won't
do! And I'll tell you why. That country up there is full of rebels--the
lowest kind there are. It just takes one shot to lay me out or cripple
one of our horses. Then I'd have to make a fight for it--but what would
happen to you?"
</p><p>"I'd fight, too!" spoke up Gracia resolutely. "I'm not afraid."
</p><p>"No," grumbled Bud, "you don't know them rebels. You've been shut up in
a house all the time--if you'd been through what I have in the last six
months you'd understand what I mean."
</p><p>"If Phil were here, <u>he'd</u> take me!" countered Gracia, and then Bud
lost his head.
</p><p>"Yes," he burst out, "that's jest what's the matter with the crazy
fool! That's jest why he's up across the line now a hollering for me to
save his girl! He's brave, is he? Well, why don't he come down, then,
and save you himself? Because he's afraid to! He's afraid of getting
shot or going up against Manuel del Rey. By grab! it makes me tired the
way you people talk! If he'd done what I told him to in the first place
he wouldn't have got into this jack-pot!"
</p><p>"Oh, my!" exclaimed Gracia, aghast. "Why, what is the matter with you?
And what did you tell him to do?"
</p><p>"I told him to mind his own business," answered Hooker bluntly.
</p><p>"And what did he say?"
</p><p>"He said he'd try anything--once!"
</p><p>Bud spat out the phrase vindictively, for his blood was up and his
heart was full of bitterness.
</p><p>"Oh, dear!" faltered Gracia. "And so you do not think that Phil is
brave?"
</p><p>"He's brave to start things," sneered Bud, "but not to carry 'em
through!"
</p><p>For a moment Gracia huddled up against a pillar, her hand against her
face, as if to ward off a blow. Then she lowered it slowly and moved
reluctantly away.
</p><p>"I must go now," she said, and Bud did not offer to stay her, for he
saw what his unkindness had done.
</p><p>"I am sorry!" she added pitifully, but he did not answer. There was
nothing that he could say now.
</p><p>In a moment of resentment, driven to exasperation by her taunts, he had
forgotten his pledge to his pardner and come between him and his girl.
That which he thought wild horses could not draw from him had flashed
out in a fit of anger--and the damage was beyond amendment, for what he
had said was the truth.
