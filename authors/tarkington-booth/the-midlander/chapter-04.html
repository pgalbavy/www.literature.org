<p><em>SHE </em>nodded to where before them a long wooden picket
fence outlined the street boundary of Mrs. Savage’s lawn. Here
was an older quarter than that upper reach of National Avenue
whence the two young people had come; the houses here and southward
were most of them substantial and ample, but not of the imposing
spaciousness prevailing farther up the avenue. Three or four of
them had felt the seventies so deeply as to adopt the mansard
roof in company with one or two parasite slate turrets; but in
the main the houses were without pretentiousness; and among them
it was curious and pleasant to see lingering two or three white,
low-gabled cottages of a single story.</p>

<p>In the summertime old-fashioned flowers grew in the yards of
these, and there might be morning-glories climbing over the front
doors; for the cottages were relics of the time when the city
was a village and this region was the outlying fringe, beyond
the end of the wooden sidewalks. Now, however, it was almost upon
the edge of commerce;—there was smoke in the air, and through
the haze were seen rising, a few blocks to the south, the blue
silhouettes of dozens of office buildings, the court-house tower,
and the giant oblong of the first skyscraper, the First National
Bank, eleven stories high. Moreover, one of the white cottages
had for next-door neighbour the first apartment house to be built
in the city;—it was just finished, rose seven stories above its
little neighbour, and was significantly narrow. The ground here
had already become costly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Savage’s gray picket fence joined the white picket fence
of the overshadowed white cottage and her house was a good sample
of four-square severity, built of brick and painted gray, with
two noble old walnut trees in front, one on each side of the brick
walk that led from the gate to the small veranda. Here she had
lived during little less than half a century;—that is to say,
ever since her house had been called "the finest residence in
the city," when her husband built it in the decade before the
Civil War. Here, too, she "preferred to die," as she said brusquely
when her daughter wished her to come and live at the Oliphants’,
after Mr. Savage’s death. She was still "fully able to keep house"
for herself, she added, and expected to do so until Smith and
Lieven came for her; Smith and Lieven being the undertakers who
had conducted all the funerals in her family.</p>

<p>But at ninety-two it is impossible to withhold all concessions;
even a lady whose pioneer father whipped her when she was fifteen
must bend a little; and although Mrs. Savage still declined to
sit in a comfortable chair, she took a daily nap in the afternoon.
She had just risen and descended to her parlour, and settled herself
by the large front window, when the two young people, coming along
the sidewalk, reached the north end of her picket fence.</p>

<p>She did not recognize them at first; for, although her eyes "held
out," as she said, they held out not quite well enough for her
to see faces except as ivory or pinkish blurs, unless they were
close to her. However, the two figures interested her; and because
of their slow approach and something intimate in the way they
seemed to be communing, she guessed that they might be lovers.
To her surprise, they halted at her gate, but, instead of coming
in, continued their conversation there for several moments. Then,
though they appeared loath to separate, each took both of the
other’s hands for a moment, in an impulsive gesture distinctly
expressive of emotion, and the woman’s figure went down the street,
walking hurriedly, while the man’s came in at the gate and approached
the front door. Mrs. Savage recognized her grandson, but no slightest
change in her expression or attitude marked the moment of recognition.</p>

<p>Upon the sound of the bell, the old coloured man who had been
her servant for thirty years came softly through the hall, but
instead of opening the door to the visitor he presented himself
before his mistress in the parlour. He was a thin old man of the
darkest brown, neat and erect, with a patient expression, a beautifully
considerate manner, and a tremulous tenor voice. In addition,
his given name was both romantic and religious: Nimbus.</p>

<p>"You like to receive callers, Miz Savage?" he inquired. "Doorbell
ring."</p>

<p>"I heard it," the old lady informed him somewhat crisply. "Have
you any reason to suppose I can’t hear my own doorbell?"</p>

<p>"No’m."</p>

<p>"Then why did you see fit to mention that it rang?"</p>

<p>"I don’ know, ’m. You hear good as what I do, Miz Savage," he
returned apologetically. "I dess happen say she ring. Mean nothin’
’t all. You like me bring ’em in or say ain’t home, please?"</p>

<p>"It’s my grandson, Dan."</p>

<p>"Yes’m," said Nimbus, turning to the door; "I go git him."</p>

<p>He went out into the broad hall and opened the door to the thoughtful
young man waiting there, who shook hands with him and greeted
him warmly; whereupon Nimbus glowed visibly, expressing great
pleasure and cordiality. "My goo’nuss me!" he said. "Hope I be
close on hand when you git ready shed them clo’es, Mist’ Dan.
You’ grammaw cert’n’y be overjoice’ to see you ag’in. She settin’
in polluh waitin’ fer you, if you kinely leave me rest you’ silk
hat an’ gole-head cane. <em>My</em>, look at all the gole on nat
cane!"</p>

<p>Receiving this emblem of state with murmurous reverence, he solicitously
bore it to the marble-topped table as the young man entered the
room where his grandmother awaited him. She sat by the broad window,
which had been the first plate-glass window in the town, and in
her cap with lace lappets and her full, dark gown, she was not
unsuggestive, in spite of her great age, of Whistler’s portrait
of his mother. Certainly, until her grandson took her hand and
sat down beside her, she was as motionless as a portrait.</p>

<p>"Grandma," he said remorsefully, "I’m afraid you feel mighty
hurt with me. I know it looked pretty selfish of me not to come
home sooner, so we could go ahead and get grandpa’s estate settled
up. I expect you think I haven’t been very thoughtful of you,
and you certainly have got a right to feel kind of cross with
me, but the truth is——"</p>

<p>"No," she interrupted quietly. "Your father was too busy to attend
to the estate himself, and I didn’t want Harlan because I know
he’d spend all his time criticizing; and besides he didn’t offer
to do it in the first place, and you did. But your father hired
a lawyer for me, and the work’s about finished."</p>

<p>"I know what you think of me——" he began but again she interrupted.</p>

<p>"No; you behaved naturally in staying away. Young people always
say they like to help old people, but it isn’t natural. Mankind
are all really just Indians, naturally. In some of the lower Indian
tribes they kill off everybody that gets old and useless, and
that’s really the instinct of the young in what we call civilization.
We old people understand how you young people really think of
us."</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" the young man groaned. "I was afraid you were a little
hurt with me, but I didn’t dream you’d feel <em>this</em> way
about it."</p>

<p>"No," she said;—"you were having too good a time to dream how
anybody’d feel about anything. Your father and mother worried
some about you, and once or twice your father talked of going
East to see what you were up to. They were afraid you were running
wild, but I told ’em they needn’t fret about that."</p>

<p>"Did you, grandma?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Your running wild would never amount to much; you come
of too steady a stock on both sides not to get over it and settle
down. No; what I was afraid of is just what I expect has happened."</p>

<p>"What’s that?" Dan asked indulgently. "What do you think’s happened,
grandma? Think I got too extravagant and threw away a lot of money?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied; and to his uncomfortable amazement continued
grimly: "I expect you’ve fallen in love with some no-account New
York girl and want to marry her."</p>

<p>"Grandma!"</p>

<p>"I do!" the old lady asserted. "Isn’t that what’s been the matter
with you?"</p>

<p>She spoke challengingly, with an angry note in the challenge,
and Dan’s colour, ruddy after his walk, grew ruddier;—the phrase
"no-account New York girl" hurt and offended him, even though
his grandmother knew nothing whatever of Lena McMillan. "You’re
very much mistaken," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"I hope so," Mrs. Savage returned. "Who was that you were talking
to out at my front gate?"</p>

<p>"Martha Shelby."</p>

<p>"Martha? That’s all right," she said, and added abruptly: "If
you’ve got to marry somebody you ought to marry her."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"If you’ve got to marry somebody," this uncomfortable old lady
repeated, "why don’t you marry Martha?"</p>

<p>"Why, that’s just preposterous!" Dan protested. "The last person
in the world Martha’d ever think of marrying would be me, and
the last person I’d ever think of marrying would be Martha."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why?" he repeated incredulously. "Why, because we aren’t in
love with each other and never <em>could</em> be! Never in the
world!"</p>

<p>"It isn’t necessary," Mrs. Savage informed him. "You’d get along
better if you weren’t. Martha comes of good stock, and she’s like
her stock."</p>

<p>"There are other ‘good stocks’ in the country," he thought proper
to remind her gently. "There are a few people in New York of fairly
good ‘stock’, you know, grandma."</p>

<p>"Maybe a few," she said;—"but not our kind. The surest way to
make misery is to mix stocks. You come of the best stock in the
country, and you’ll be mighty sick some day if you go mixing it
with a bad one."</p>

<p>"But good gracious!" he cried, "who’s talking of my mixing it
with a——"</p>

<p>"Never mind," she interrupted crossly. "I know what those New
York girls are like."</p>

<p>"But, grandma——"</p>

<p>"I do," she insisted. "They don’t know anything in the world
except French and soirées, and it’s no wonder when you look at
their stocks!"</p>

<p>"Grandma——"</p>

<p>"Listen to me," she bade him sharply. "The best stocks in England
were the yeoman stocks; you ought to know that much, yourself,
after all these years you’ve spent at school and college. The
strongest in mind and body out of the English yeoman stocks came
to America; they fought the Indians and the French and the British
and got themselves a country of their own. Then, after that, the
strongest in mind and body out of those stocks came out here and
opened this new country and built it up. All they’ve got left
in the East now are the remnants that didn’t have gumption and
get-up enough to strike out for the new land. The only thing that
keeps the East going is the people that emigrate back there from
here in the second and third generations. Don’t you mix your stock
with any remnants! D’you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma’am," he meekly replied, dismayed not only by the extremity
of the discouraging old lady’s view upon "stocks" and "New York
girls," but also by her shrewdness in divining the cause of his
long absence. Nevertheless, he ventured to protest again, though
feebly. "I think if you could see New York nowadays, grandma,
you wouldn’t think it’s a city built by ‘remnants,’ exactly."</p>

<p>"I don’t have to see it," she retorted. "I know history; and
besides, I was there with your grandfather in eighteen fifty-nine.
We stayed two weeks at the Astor House, and your grandfather was
mighty glad to get back here to home cooking. Even then all the
smart men in New York came from somewhere else. Outside of them
and the politicians, the only New York people you ever hear anything
about are the ones that have had just barely gumption enough to
be stingy."</p>

<p>"What? Why, grandma——"</p>

<p>"They never made anything; they’ve just barely got the gumption
to hold on to what’s been left to ’em," she insisted. "As soon
as anybody gets money, everybody else sets in to try to get it
away from him. They try to get him to give it away; they try to
trade him out of it, or to swindle him out of it, or to steal
it from him. Everybody wants money and the only way to get it
is to get it from somebody else; but for all that, the lowest
form of owning money is just inheriting it and sitting down on
it; and that’s just about all they know how to do, these New York
folks you seem to think so much of!"</p>

<p>"But my goodness, grandma!" the troubled young man exclaimed.
"I haven’t said——"</p>

<p>She cut him off again, for she was far from the conclusion of
her discourse; and he got the impression—a correct one—that during
his protracted absence she had been bottling within herself the
considerable effervescence she now released upon him. She interrupted
him with great spirit. "You wait till I’m through, and then you
can have your say! I know these New York girls better than you
do. You aren’t capable of knowing anything about women anyway,
at your age. You’re the kind of young man that idealizes anything
that’ll give you half a chance to idealize it. You are! I’ve watched
you. What do girls mean to a young man like you? If he doesn’t
think they’re good-looking, they don’t mean anything at all to
him; it’s just the same as if they weren’t living. But if he thinks
some silly little thing is pretty, and she takes special notice
of him, that’s enough;—he’s liable to start right in and act like
a crazy man over her! She may be the biggest fool, and the meanest
one, too, on earth; he thinks she’s got all the goodness and all
the wisdom in the universe! You can’t help getting into that state
about her; but after you’ve been married awhile the gloss’ll wear
off and you’ll begin to notice what you’ve tied yourself up to—to
live with till you’re dead!"</p>

<p>"But I haven’t told you——"</p>

<p>Again she disregarded him. "<em>I</em> know these New York highty-tighties!"
she said. "Your grandfather and I went to Saratoga the year after
the war, and we spent a month there. We saw a plenty of ’em! They
aren’t fit to do anything but flirt and talk French and go to
soirées. They’re the most ignorant people I ever met in my life.
They’re so ignorant if you asked their opinion of Lalla Rookh
they wouldn’t know what you were talking about; but they think
you’re funny if you don’t know that some fancy milliner of theirs
keeps store on Broadway and not on the Bowery. That’s about the
measure of ’em."</p>

<p>"Well, not nowadays, exactly," her grandson said indulgently.
"Some of the ones you saw at Saratoga thirty or forty years ago
may have been like that, grandma, but nowadays——"</p>

<p>"Nowadays," she said, taking the word up sharply, "they’re just
the same. They fooled the young men then just the same as they
fool ’em now. They make a young man like you think they know everything,
because they’re pretty and talk that affected way Harlan does."</p>

<p>"But with them it isn’t affected, grandma. It’s natural with
them. They’ve <em>always</em>——"</p>

<p>But the obdurate old lady contradicted him instantly. "It’s not!
It isn’t natural for any human being to talk like that! You mustn’t
bring one of those girls out here to live, Dan."</p>

<p>"Grandma"—he began in an uneasy voice; "Grandma, I came here
to tell you——"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was afraid of it," she said. "I was afraid of it."</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?"</p>

<p>A plaintive frown appeared upon her forehead before she answered.
She sighed deeply, as if the increased rapidity of her breathing
had made her insecure of continuing to breathe at all; and her
frail hands, folded in her lap, moved nervously. "Don’t do it,
Dan," she said. "You ought to wait a few years before you marry,
anyway. You’re so young, and one of those New York girls wouldn’t
understand things here; she wouldn’t know enough not to feel superior.
You’d just make misery for yourself."</p>

<p>But at this he laughed confidently. "You don’t know the one I’m
thinkin’ of," he said. "You’ve guessed something of what I came
to tell you, grandma, but you’ve certainly missed fire about her!
I’ll show you." And from his breast pocket he took an exquisite
flat case of blue leather and silver; opened it, and handed it
to her. "There’s her photograph. I’d like to see if you think
<em>she’s</em> the kind you’ve been talkin’ about!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Savage put on the eye-glasses she wore fastened to a thin
chain round her neck, and examined the photograph of Lena McMillan.
She looked at it steadily for a long minute, then handed it back
to her grandson, removed her glasses, and, without a word, again
folding her hands in her lap, looked out of the window.</p>

<p>Under these discomfiting circumstances Dan said, as hopefully
as he could, "You’ve changed your mind now, haven’t you, grandma?"</p>

<p>"On account of that picture?" she asked, without altering her
attitude.</p>

<p>"Yes. Don’t you think she’s—don’t you think she’s——"</p>

<p>"Don’t I think she’s what?" Mrs. Savage inquired in a dead voice.</p>

<p>"Don’t you think she’s perfect?"</p>

<p>"Perfect?" Expressionlessly, she turned and looked at him. "What
are your plans, Dan?"</p>

<p>"You mean, when do we expect to——"</p>

<p>"No. What business are you going into?"</p>

<p>"Well——" He paused doubtfully; "I still hope—I mean, if I don’t
have to go to New York to live——"</p>

<p>"So?" she interrupted with seeming placidity. "She declines to
come here to live, does she? She hates it here, does she, already?"</p>

<p>"I don’t think she would," he said quickly. "Not if she once
got used to it. You see she doesn’t know anything about it; she’s
never been west of Rochester, and she only <em>thinks</em> she
wouldn’t like it. I’ve been doin’ my best to persuade her."</p>

<p>"But you couldn’t?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven’t given up," he said. "I think when the time comes——"</p>

<p>"But if she won’t, ‘when the time comes’," Mrs. Savage suggested;—"then
instead of living here, where you’ve grown up and want to live,
you’ll go and spend your life in New York. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I——"</p>

<p>"So you’d do it," she said, "just to please the face in that
photograph!"</p>

<p>"You don’t understand, grandma," he returned, and he hurriedly
passed a handkerchief across his distressed forehead. "You see,
it isn’t only Lena herself don’t think much of our part of the
country. You see, her family——"</p>

<p>"Ah!" the grim lady interrupted. "She’s got a family, has she?
Indeed?"</p>

<p>"Great goodness!" he groaned, "I mean her father and mother and
her sister and her aunts and her married sister, and everybody.
They’re important people, you see."</p>

<p>"Are they? What do they do that’s important?"</p>

<p>"It isn’t so much what they do exactly," he explained, "it’s
what they <em>are</em>. You see, they’re descended from General
McMillan and——"</p>

<p>"General McMillan? Never heard of him. What was he a general
of? New York militia? Knights of Pythias, maybe?"</p>

<p>"I’m not exactly certain," Dan admitted, again applying his handkerchief
to his forehead. "I think he had something to do with history
before the Revolution. I don’t know just what, but anyhow they
all feel it was pretty important; and you see to them, why I’m
just nobody at all, and of course they must feel I’m pretty crude.
It’s true, too, because I <em>am</em> crude compared to Lena;
and for a good while her family were more or less against any
such engagement. Of course, the way they think about <em>my</em>
family is even worse than the way you think about <em>them</em>,
grandma; and naturally she says herself they’re positive it’d
be a terrible sacrifice for her to come and live out here. I mean
that’s the way they look at it."</p>

<p>"Of course they do," said Mrs. Savage. "That’s the way those
New York people at Saratoga thought about this part of the country.
They’re just the same nowadays, I told you; they haven’t got the
kind of brains that can learn anything. Does this photograph girl
herself talk about what a ‘sacrifice’ it would be for her to live
here?"</p>

<p>"Lena McMillan is a noble girl," Dan informed her earnestly.
"She feels a lot of respect for her family’s wishes, and besides
she doesn’t like the idea of leavin’ New York herself; but I don’t
remember her usin’ the word ‘sacrifice’ exactly. She doesn’t put
it that way."</p>

<p>"What about <em>you</em>? Do you put it that way? Do you think
it would be a sacrifice for her to come and live here?"</p>

<p>"I?" Dan was obviously astonished to be asked such a question.
"Why, my goodness!" he exclaimed, "I wouldn’t be beggin’ her to
try it if I thought so, would I? If I can just get her to try
it I know she’ll like it. How could anybody help likin’ it?"</p>

<p>"You’re pretty liable to find out how this photograph girl will
help it!" his grandmother prophesied, and promptly checked him
as he began to protest against her repeated definition of Lena
as "this photograph girl." She retorted, "Tut, tut!" as a snub
to his protest, then inquired: "What business do you expect to
go into, if you live in New York?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know," he said gloomily. "I don’t see what I could do
there."</p>

<p>"What will you do if you stay here?"</p>

<p>At that he brightened instantly. "Why, I think I’ve got hold
of a big idea, grandma. I began to think about it last September,
and it’s been in my mind all the time I was away;—I’ve been goin’
over it and workin’ it out. It’s something would make a mighty
good profit for me and at the same time I think it’d be a big
thing for this city."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" she said. "Yes, you’re at the age when everything looks
like a ‘big thing.’ Your grandfather used to talk like that when
we were first married."</p>

<p>"Well, he was one of this city’s most successful men, wasn’t
he? He did do big things, didn’t he?"</p>

<p>"That was in the early days when he kept us poor," she said,
with a short laugh of extreme dryness. "He had ideas about going
into things to make this a greater city, and get ‘a mighty good
profit’ for himself, the way you talk now—but what finally made
his money was keeping <em>out</em> of big schemes. It was what
I kept him from doing that made us well off, not what he did.
We saved and went into safe things like the First National Bank
stock. When it comes to you and Harlan, after I’m gone, you mustn’t
ever sell that bank stock, Dan. What is this ‘big idea’ you spoke
of?"</p>

<p>"It’s the old Ornaby farm, grandma."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," she assented with ready satire. "Yes; this photograph
girl will make a fine farmer’s wife!"</p>

<p>"No, she won’t," he returned good-naturedly. "That farm lies
right where this city’s bound to grow to. I want to take the money
grandpa left me and buy it. Then I’ll lay it out in lots and make
an Addition of it."</p>

<p>"So?" she said. "That’s the ‘big idea,’ is it?"</p>

<p>"That’s it, grandma."</p>

<p>She shook her head in pitying skepticism. "You can’t carry it
out. In the first place, the town’ll never grow that far out——"</p>

<p>"Yes, it will," he interrupted eagerly. "Why, in three years
at the longest——"</p>

<p>"No," she said; "it won’t. Not in three years and not in thirty.
Anyhow, your grandfather only left you twenty-five thousand dollars.
You’d better keep it and not throw it away, Dan."</p>

<p>"I can get the Ornaby farm for seventeen thousand," he informed
her. "That’ll leave eight thousand to clear off the lots and put
asphalt streets through and——"</p>

<p>"Put asphalt streets through!" she echoed. "How many miles of
asphalt streets do you expect to build with eight thousand dollars
after you’ve cleared the lots and advertised enough to boom an
Addition?"</p>

<p>"I’ve been hopin’ I’d get help on that," he said, his colour
heightening a little. "I thought maybe I could get Harlan to come
in with the twenty-five thousand grandpa left him. If he does——"</p>

<p>"He won’t. Harlan isn’t the kind to risk anything. He won’t."</p>

<p>"Well, then," Dan said, "I’ll go ahead and get other people.
I’m goin’ to do it, grandma, if I have to take an ax and a shovel
and a wheelbarrow out there and do it all by myself. I’ve been
thinkin’ it over a long time, and I know it’s a big thing." He
laughed a little at his own enthusiasm, but again declared, with
earnest determination: "Yes, ma’am! I’m goin’ to build ‘Ornaby
Addition.’"</p>

<p>But his grandmother’s compassionate skepticism was not lessened.
On the contrary, she asked him quietly: "You’re going to build
‘Ornaby Addition’ at the same time you expect to be living in
New York with this photograph girl for a wife? How do you think
you’ll manage it, Dan?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she’ll come here," he said. "I know she will, when I make
her see what a big chance this idea of mine gives us. I think
I can get her to try it, anyhow; and if she’ll just do that it’ll
come out all right."</p>

<p>"You think she’ll be a great help to you, do you, while you’re
working with a wheelbarrow out on Ornaby’s farm?"</p>

<p>"Do I?" he exclaimed, and added radiantly: "‘A help?’ Why, grandma,
she—she’ll be a great deal more than a help; she’ll be an inspiration!
That’s exactly what she’ll be, grandma."</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Savage looked at him fixedly, sighed, and spoke as in
a reverie. "Ah, me! How many, many young men I’ve seen believing
such things in my long time here! How many, many I’ve seen that
were going to do big things, and how many that thought some no-account
girl was going to be their inspiration!"</p>

<p>"Grandma!" he cried indignantly, and rose from his chair. "You
haven’t any right to speak of her like that."</p>

<p>"No right?" she said quietly. "No, I s’pose not. I wonder how
many hundred times in my life I’ve been told I hadn’t any right
to speak the truth. It must be so."</p>

<p>"But it <em>isn’t</em> the truth," Dan protested, and in a plaintive
agitation he moved toward the door. "I showed you a photograph
of the sweetest, noblest, most beautiful woman that’s ever come
into my life, and you speak of her as—as—well, as you just did
speak of her, grandma! I wouldn’t hurt your feelings for the world,
but I—well, you aren’t fair. I don’t want to say any more than
that, so I expect I better go."</p>

<p>"Wait!" she said sharply; and he halted in the doorway. "You
wait a minute, young man. I’m going to say my last say to you,
and you better listen!"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I will, if you want me to, grandma," he assented,
as he came back into the room and stood before her. "Only I hope
you won’t say anything against her; and I don’t think you ought
to call it your ‘last say’ to me. I’m sure you won’t stop speakin’
to me."</p>

<p>"Won’t I?" she asked; and he was aware of a strange pathos in
her glance, and that her head constantly shook a little. "Won’t
I? I’m going to stop speaking to everybody, Dan, before long."</p>

<p>"But you look so well, grandma; you oughtn’t to talk like that."</p>

<p>"Never mind. My talking is about over, but I’m going to tell
you something you may remember when I can’t talk any more at all.
Your father and mother won’t even try to have any influence with
you; they haven’t raised their children the way I did mine. Your
father and mother have always been too easy-going with you to
really help you by disciplining you when you wanted to do anything
wrong, and they’ll both act the gentle fool with you now, just
as they always have about everything. They won’t stop you from
going ahead with this photograph girl."</p>

<p>"No," Dan said gently;—"and nothing could stop me, grandma. I
told you she’s the finest, most beautiful——"</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" the old lady cried. "How much of that same sort of
twaddle do you suppose a body’s heard in a life of ninety-two
years? How many times do you suppose I’ve had to listen to just
such stuff? Good heavens!"</p>

<p>"But, grandma——"</p>

<p>"You listen to <em>me</em>!" she said with sudden ferocity. "You
don’t know anything about the girl, and you don’t know anything
about yourself. At your age you don’t know anything about anything.
You don’t even know you don’t know. And another thing you don’t
know is, how much you’ve told me about this girl and her family
without knowing it."</p>

<p>"Grandma, I told you they’re fine people and——"</p>

<p>"Fine people!" she said bitterly. "Oh, yes! And how have they
treated you?"</p>

<p>"Why, aren’t they givin’ me their—their dearest treasure? Doesn’t
that show how they——"</p>

<p>"Yes, doesn’t it?" she interrupted. "It shows how much of a treasure
<em>they</em> think she is!"</p>

<p>"Grandma——"</p>

<p>"You listen! You’re a splendid young man, Dan Oliphant. You’re
good-looking; you’re honourable as the daylight; you’re kindhearted,
and you’d be just as polite to a nigger or a dog as you would
to the President; and anybody can tell all that about you by just
looking at you once. But this good-for-nothing girl and her good-for-nothing
family have made you feel you weren’t anybody at all, and ought
to feel flattered to scrub their doormat! Don’t tell me! They
have! And because you let yourself get as soft as a ninny over
a silly little pretty face, you truckle to ’em."</p>

<p>"Grandma!" He laughed despairingly. "I haven’t been truckling
to anybody."</p>

<p>"You have, and she’ll keep you at it all your life!" the old
lady said angrily. "<em>I</em> know what that face means. I’ve
seen a thousand just like it! She’ll use you and make you truckle
to <em>be</em> used! And if you give in to her and live in her
town, she’ll despise you. If you make her come and live in your
town, she’ll hate you. But she’ll always keep you truckling. Your
only chance is to get rid of her."</p>

<p>"Grandma," he said desperately;—"I’m sorry, but I can’t hear
you talk this way about the sweetest, the most perfect, the loveliest——"</p>

<p>"Get rid of her!" she cried. And as the distressed young man
went out into the hall she leaned forward in her chair, shaking
at him a piteously bent and emaciated forefinger. "You get rid
of her, if you don’t want to die in the gutter! Get rid of her!" </p>
