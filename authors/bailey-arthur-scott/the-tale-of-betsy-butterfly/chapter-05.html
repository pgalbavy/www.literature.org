<p>MUCH to Mrs. Ladybug's surprise, she did not find Betsy Butterfly in the
flower garden.
</p>
<p>"It's too bad she's not here," Mrs. Ladybug remarked to her friend
Jennie Junebug, who accompanied her. "We'll have to look in the meadow.
And it may take a long time to find Betsy there."
</p><p>Jennie Junebug yawned right in Mrs. Ladybug's face.
</p><p>"Then I can't come with you," she said. "I'm getting terribly sleepy
again. And since I expect to be up all night, I'm going to take a nap."
</p><p>Mrs. Ladybug looked at Jennie with great disapproval as that fat young
person crept under a leaf and went to sleep.
</p><p>"Things have come to a pretty pass when ladies stay out all night!" she
muttered. "It was not that way when I was a girl. But times have changed
for the worse."
</p><p>The longer Mrs. Ladybug stared at her sleeping friend, the more she
thought that she ought to wake her up. "If I rouse her she'll be so
drowsy to-night that she'll simply have to go to bed," Mrs. Ladybug
thought.
</p><p>So she poked Jennie Junebug several times.
</p><p>But Jennie Junebug only stirred slightly and murmured something in her
sleep.
</p><p>And seeing that it was useless to try to awaken her Mrs. Ladybug set out
for the meadow alone.
</p><p>The sun hung low in the west when Mrs. Ladybug found Betsy Butterfly
among a clump of milk-weed blossoms. But Mrs. Ladybug did not care what
time it was. She was satisfied when she saw that Betsy was just as dusty
as ever. For, to tell the truth, little Mrs. Ladybug was so jealous of
the beautiful Betsy that she <u>wanted</u> to say something disagreeable to
her.
</p><p>"Hasn't this been a lovely day?" Betsy Butterfly cried happily, as soon
as she noticed Mrs. Ladybug. "I've enjoyed every moment of it. Ever
since I saw you in the flower garden this morning I've been here in the
meadow, flitting from one blossom to another."
</p><p>"You might better have spent a little of your time in a different way,"
Mrs. Ladybug remarked with a frown.
</p><p>Betsy Butterfly looked up in surprise, withdrawing her long tongue from
the blossom in which she had just buried it.
</p><p>"_Ugh!_" A shudder shook prim Mrs. Ladybug. "Please coil your tongue!"
she begged. "I can't bear the sight of it. But I must say that I ought
not to expect good manners in a person who goes about looking as untidy
as you do."
</p><p>Betsy Butterfly laughed gaily.
</p><p>"I didn't know you were such a joker!" she exclaimed.
</p><p>"Oh, I'm not joking," Mrs. Ladybug said. "I mean every word I say."
</p><p>"Then I wouldn't talk so much, if I were you," Betsy Butterfly advised
her with a merry twinkle in her eye. And before Mrs. Ladybug could say
another word Betsy Butterfly flew away and left her spluttering and
choking.
</p><p>"She insulted me!" Mrs. Ladybug screamed, as soon as she was able to
speak. "She insulted me. And then she hurried off because she didn't
dare stay!"
</p><p>But Mrs. Ladybug was mistaken about one thing. Betsy Butterfly knew that
she had just time to reach home before sunset. So that was why she left
so suddenly. For she never was willing to travel when the sun was not
shining.
</p><p>"I'll see Betsy in the morning," Mrs. Ladybug promised herself savagely.
"I'll make it my business to follow her everywhere she goes, until I've
given her a good talking to."
