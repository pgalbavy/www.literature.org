<p>Superintendent Battle replaced the sheet with the slightly crest-fallen
air of a man whose best point has fallen flat. Anthony stood with
his hands in his pockets lost in thought.</p>

<p>"So that’s what old Lollipop meant when he talked about ‘other
means,’" he murmured at last.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Cade?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, superintendent. Forgive my abstraction. You see, I—or
rather my friend, Jimmy McGrath, has been very neatly done out
of a thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"A thousand pounds is a nice sum of money," said Battle.</p>

<p>"It isn’t the thousand pounds so much," said Anthony, "though
I agree with you that it’s a nice sum of money. It’s being done
that maddens me. I handed over that manuscript like a little woolly
lamb. It hurts, superintendent, indeed it hurts."</p>

<p>The detective said nothing.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Anthony. "Regrets are vain, and all may not
yet be lost. I’ve only got to get hold of dear old Stylptitch’s
Reminiscences between now and next Wednesday and all will be gas
and gaiters."</p>

<p>"Would you mind coming back to the Council Chamber, Mr. Cade?
There’s one little thing I want to point out to you."</p>

<p>Back in the Council Chamber, the detective strode over at once
to the middle window.</p>

<p>"I’ve been thinking, Mr. Cade. This particular window is very
stiff, very stiff indeed. You might have been mistaken in thinking
that it was fastened. It might just have stuck. I’m sure—yes,
I’m almost sure, that you <em>were</em> mistaken."</p>

<p>Anthony eyed him keenly.</p>

<p>"And supposing I say that I’m quite sure I was not?"</p>

<p>"Don’t you think you could have been?" said Battle, looking at
him very steadily.</p>

<p>"Well, to oblige you, superintendent, yes."</p>

<p>Battle smiled in a satisfied fashion.</p>

<p>"You’re quick in the uptake, sir. And you’ll have no objection
to saying so, careless like, at a suitable moment?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. I——"</p>

<p>He paused, as Battle gripped his arm. The superintendent was
bent forward, listening.</p>

<p>Enjoining silence on Anthony with a gesture, he tiptoed noiselessly
to the door, and flung it suddenly open.</p>

<p>On the threshold stood a tall man with black hair neatly parted
in the middle, china blue eyes with a particularly innocent expression,
and a large placid face.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, gentlemen," he said in a slow drawling voice with
a pronounced transatlantic accent. "But is it permitted to inspect
the scene of the crime? I take it that you are both gentlemen
from Scotland Yard?"</p>

<p>"I have not that honour," said Anthony. "But this gentleman is
Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said the American gentleman, with a great appearance
of interest. "Pleased to meet you, sir. My name is Hiram P. Fish,
of New York City."</p>

<p>"What was it you wanted to see, Mr. Fish?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>The American walked gently into the room, and looked with much
interest at the dark patch on the floor.</p>

<p>"I am interested in crime, Mr. Battle. It is one of my hobbies.
I have contributed a monograph to one of our weekly periodicals
on the subject ‘Degeneracy and the Criminal.’"</p>

<p>As he spoke, his eyes went gently round the room, seeming to
note everything in it. They rested just a shade longer on the
window.</p>

<p>"The body," said Superintendent Battle, stating a self-evident
fact, "has been removed."</p>

<p>"Surely," said Mr. Fish. His eyes went on to the panelled walls.
"Some remarkable pictures in this room, gentlemen. A Holbein,
two Van Dycks, and, if I am not mistaken, a Velasquez. I am interested
in pictures—and likewise in first editions. It was to see his
first editions that Lord Caterham was so kind as to invite me
down here."</p>

<p>He sighed gently.</p>

<p>"I guess that’s all off now. It would show a proper feeling I
suppose, for the guests to return to town immediately?"</p>

<p>"I’m afraid that can’t be done, sir," said Superintendent Battle.
"Nobody must leave the house until after the inquest."</p>

<p>"Is that so? And when is the inquest?"</p>

<p>"May be to-morrow, may not be until Monday. We’ve got to arrange
for the autopsy and see the Coroner."</p>

<p>"I get you," said Mr. Fish. "Under the circumstances, though,
it will be a melancholy party."</p>

<p>Battle led the way to the door.</p>

<p>"We’d best get out of here," he said. "We’re keeping it locked
still."</p>

<p>He waited for the other two to pass through, and then turned
the key and removed it.</p>

<p>"I opine," said Mr. Fish, "that you are seeking for finger prints?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," said the superintendent laconically.</p>

<p>"I should say to that, on a night such as last night, an intruder
would have left footprints on the hardwood floor."</p>

<p>"None inside, plenty outside."</p>

<p>"Mine," explained Anthony cheerfully.</p>

<p>The innocent eyes of Mr. Fish swept over him.</p>

<p>"Young man," he said, "you surprise me."</p>

<p>They turned a corner, and came out into the big wide hall, paneled
like the Council Chamber in old oak, and with a wide gallery above
it. Two other figures came into sight at the far end.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said Mr. Fish. "Our genial host."</p>

<p>This was such a ludicrous description of Lord Caterham that Anthony
had to turn his head away to conceal a smile.</p>

<p>"And with him," continued the American, "is a lady whose name
I did not catch last night. But she is bright—she is very bright."</p>

<p>With Lord Caterham was Virginia Revel.</p>

<p>Anthony had been anticipating this meeting all along. He had
no idea how to act. He must leave it to Virginia. Although he
had full confidence in her presence of mind, he had not the slightest
idea what line she would take. He was not long left in doubt.</p>

<p>"Why, it’s Mr. Cade," said Virginia. She held out both hands
to him. "So you found you could come down after all?"</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Revel, I had no idea Mr. Cade was a friend of yours,"
said Lord Caterham.</p>

<p>"He’s a very old friend," said Virginia, smiling at Anthony with
a mischievous glint in her eye. "I ran across him in London unexpectedly
yesterday, and told him I was coming down here."</p>

<p>Anthony was quick to give her her pointer.</p>

<p>"I explained to Mrs. Revel," he said, "that I had been forced
to refuse your kind invitation—since it had really been extended
to quite a different man. And I couldn’t very well foist a perfect
stranger on you under false pretences."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my dear fellow," said Lord Caterham, "that’s all
over and done with now. I’ll send down to the <em>Cricketers</em>
for your bag."</p>

<p>"It’s very kind of you, Lord Caterham, but——"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, of course you must come to Chimneys. Horrible place,
the <em>Cricketers</em>—to stay in, I mean."</p>

<p>"Of course you must come, Mr. Cade," said Virginia softly.</p>

<p>Anthony realized the altered tone of his surroundings. Already
Virginia had done much for him. He was no longer an ambiguous
stranger. Her position was so assured and unassailable that anyone
for whom she vouched was accepted as a matter of course. He thought
of the pistol in the tree at Burnham Beeches, and smiled inwardly.</p>

<p>"I’ll send for your traps," said Lord Caterham to Anthony. "I
suppose, in the circumstances, we can’t have any shooting. A pity.
But there it is. And I don’t know what the devil to do with Isaacstein.
It’s all very unfortunate."</p>

<p>The depressed peer sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"That’s settled, then," said Virginia. "You can begin to be useful
right away, Mr. Cade, and take me out on the lake. It’s very peaceful
there and far from crime and all that sort of thing. Isn’t it
awful for poor Lord Caterham having a murder done in his house?
But it’s George’s fault really. This is George’s party, you know."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Lord Caterham. "But I should never have listened to
him!"</p>

<p>He assumed the air of a strong man betrayed by a single weakness.</p>

<p>"One can’t help listening to George," said Virginia. "He always
holds you so that you can’t get away. I’m thinking of patenting
a detachable lapel."</p>

<p>"I wish you would," chuckled her host. "I’m glad you’re coming
to us, Cade. I need support."</p>

<p>"I appreciate your kindness very much, Lord Caterham," said Anthony.
"Especially," he added, "when I’m such a suspicious character.
But my staying here makes it easier for Battle."</p>

<p>"In what way, sir?" asked the superintendent.</p>

<p>"It won’t be so difficult to keep an eye on me," explained Anthony
gently.</p>

<p>And by the momentary flicker of the superintendent’s eyelids
he knew that his shot had gone home.</p>
