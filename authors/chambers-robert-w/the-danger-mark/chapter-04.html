<p>Her first winter resembled, more or less, the first winter of
the average débutante.</p>

<p>Under the roof of the metropolitan social temple there was a
niche into which her forefathers had fitted. Within the confines
of this she expected, and was expected, to live and move and have
her being, and ultimately wing upward to her God, leaving the
consecrated cubby-hole reserved for her descendants.</p>

<p>She did what her sister débutantes did, and some things they
did not do, was asked where they were asked, decorated the same
tier of boxes at the opera, appeared in the same short-skirted
entertainments of the Junior League, saw what they saw, was seen
where they were seen, chattered, danced, and flirted with the
same youths, was smitten by the popular "dancing" man, convalesced
in average time, smoked her first cigarette, fell a victim to
the handsome and horrid married destroyer, recovered with a shock
when, as usual, he overdid it, played at being engaged, was kissed
once or twice, adored Sembrich, listened ignorantly but with intuitive
shudders to her first scandals, sent flowers to Ethel Barrymore,
kept Lent with the pure fervour of a conscience troubled and untainted,
drove four in the coaching parade, and lunched afterward at the
Commonwealth Club, where her name was subsequently put up for
election.</p>

<p>Spectacular charities lured her from the Plaza to Sherry's, from
Sherry's to the St. Regis; church work beguiled her; women's suffrage,
led daintily in a series of circles by Fashion and Wealth, enlisted
her passive patronage. She even tried the slums, but the perfume
was too much for her.</p>

<p>All the small talk and epigrams of the various petty impinging
circles under the social dome passed into and out of her small
ears&mdash;gossip, epigrams, aphorisms, rumours, apropos surmises,
asides, and off-stage observations, subtle with double entendre,
harmless and otherwise.</p>

<p>She met people of fashion, of wealth, and both; and now and then
encountered one or two of those men and women of real distinction
whose names and peregrinations are seldom chronicled in the papers.</p>

<p>She heard the great artists of the two operas sing in private;
was regaled with information concerning the remarkable decency
or indecency of their private careers. She saw fashionable plays
which instructed the public about squalor, murder, and men's mistresses,
which dissected very skilfully and artistically the ethics of
moral degradation. And being as healthy and curious as the average
girl, she found in the theatres material with which to inform
herself about certain occult mysteries concerning which, heretofore,
she had been left mercifully in doubt.</p>

<p>In spite of Kathleen, it was inevitable that she should acquire
from the fashionable in literature, music, and the drama, that
sorry and unnecessary wisdom which ages souls.</p>

<p>And if what she saw or heard ever puzzled her, there was always
somebody, young or old, to enlighten her innocent perplexity;
and with each illumination she shrank a little less aloof from
this shabby wisdom gilded with "art," which she could not choose
but accept as fact, but the depravity of which she never was entirely
able to comprehend.</p>

<p>In March the Seagrave twins arrived at the alleged age of discretion.
On their twenty-first birthday the Half Moon Trust Company went
solemnly into court and rendered an accounting of its stewardship;
the yearly reports which it had made during the term of its trusteeship
were brought forward, examined by the court, and the great Half
Moon Trust Company was given an honourable discharge. It had done
its duty. The twins were masters of their financial and moral
fate.</p>

<p>It was about that moribund period of the social solstice when
the fag end of the season had fizzled out like a wet firecracker
in the April rains; and Geraldine and Kathleen were tired, mentally
and bodily. And Scott was buying polo ponies from a British friend
and shotguns from a needy gentleman from Long Island.</p>

<p>It had been rather trying work to rid Geraldine of the aspirants
for her fortune; during the winter she was proposed to under almost
every conceivable condition and circumstance. Kathleen had been
bored and badgered and bothered and importuned to the verge of
exhaustion; Scott was used, shamelessly, without his suspecting
it, and he generally had in tow a string of financially spavined
aspirants who linked arms with him from club to club, from theatre
to opera, from grille to grille, until he was pleasantly bewildered
at his own popularity.</p>

<p>Geraldine was surprised, confused, shamed, irritated in turn
with every new importunity. But she remained sensible enough to
be quite frank and truthful with Kathleen, except for an exciting
secret engagement with Bunbury Gray which lasted for two weeks.
And Kathleen was given strength sufficient for each case as it
presented itself; and now the fag end of the season died out;
the last noble and indigent foreigner had been eluded; the last
old beau foiled; the last squab-headed dancing man successfully
circumvented. And now the gallinaceous half of the world was leaving
town in noisy and glittering migration, headed for temporary roosts
all over the globe, from Newport to Nova Scotia, from Kineo to
Kara Dagh.</p>

<p>Country houses were opening throughout the Western Hemisphere;
Long Island stirred from its long winter lethargy, stung into
active life by the Oyster Bay mosquito; town houses closed; terrace,
pillar, portico, and windows were already being boarded over;
lace curtains came down; textiles went to the cleaners; the fresh
scent of camphor and lavender lingered in the mellow half-light
of rooms where furniture and pictures loomed linen-shrouded and
the polished floor echoed every footstep.</p>

<p>In the sunny gloom of the Seagrave house Geraldine found a grateful
retreat from the inspiring glare and confused racket of her first
winter; ample time for rest, reverie, and reflection, with only
a few intimates to break her meditations, only informality to
reckon with, and plenty of leisure to plan for the summer.</p>

<p>Around the house, trees and rhododendrons were now in freshest
bloom, flower-beds fragrant, grass tenderly emerald. The moving
shadows of maple leaves patterned the white walls of her bedroom;
wind-blown gusts of wistaria fragrance, from the long, grapelike,
violet-tinted bunches swaying outside the window, puffed out her
curtains every morning.</p>

<p>At night subtler perfumes stole upward from the dark garden;
the roar of traffic from the avenues was softened; carriage lights
in the purpling dusk of the Park moved like firebugs drifting
through level wooded vistas. Across the reservoir lakes the jewelled
night-zone of the West Side sparkled, reflected across the water
in points of trembling flame; south, a gemmed bar of topaz light,
upright against the sky, marked the Plaza; beyond, sprinkled into
space like constellations dusting endless depths, the lights of
the city receded far as the eye could see.</p>

<p>In the zenith the sky is always tinted with the strange, sinister
night-glow of the metropolis, red as fire-licked smoke when fog
from the bay settles, pallid as the very shadow of light when
nights are clear; but it is always there&mdash;always will be there
after the sun goes down into the western seas, and the eyes of
the monstrous iron city burn on through the centuries.</p>

<p>One morning late in April Geraldine Seagrave rode up under the
porte-cochère with her groom, dismounted, patted her horse sympathetically,
and regarded with concern the limping animal as the groom led
him away to the stables. Then she went upstairs.</p>

<p>To Kathleen, who was preparing to go out, she said:</p>

<p>"I had scarcely entered the Park, my dear, when poor Bibi pulled
up lame. No, I told Redmond not to saddle another; I suppose Duane
will be furious. Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Shall I wait for you? I've ordered a victoria."</p>

<p>"No, thanks. You look so pretty this morning, Kathleen. Sometimes
you appear younger than I do. Scott was pig enough to say so the
other day when I had a headache. It's true enough, too," she added,
smiling.</p>

<p>Kathleen Severn laughed; she looked scarcely more than twenty-five
and she knew it.</p>

<p>"You pretty thing!" exclaimed Geraldine, kissing her, "no wonder
you attract the really interesting men and leave me the dreadful
fledglings! It's bad of you; and I don't see why I'm stupid enough
to have such an attractive woman for my closest"&mdash;a kiss&mdash;"dearest
friend! Even Duane is villain enough to tell me that he finds
you overwhelmingly attractive. Did you know it?"</p>

<p>Geraldine's careless gaiety seemed spontaneous enough; yet there
was the slightest constraint in Kathleen's responsive smile:</p>

<p>"Duane isn't to be taken seriously," she said.</p>

<p>"Not by any means," nodded Geraldine, twirling her crop.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you understand him," observed Kathleen, gazing at the
point of her sunshade. She looked up presently and met Geraldine's
dark gaze. Again there came that almost imperceptible hesitation;
then:</p>

<p>"I certainly do understand Duane Mallett," said Geraldine carelessly.</p>

<p>"Shall I wait for you?" asked Kathleen. "We can lunch out together
and drive in the Park later."</p>

<p>"I'm too lazy even to take off my boots and habit. Where's that
volume of Mendez you thought fit to hide from me, you wretch?"</p>

<p>"Why on earth did you buy it?"</p>

<p>"I bought it because Rosalie Dysart says Mendez is a great modern
master of prose&#11834;"</p>

<p>"And Rosalie is a great modern mistress of pose. Don't read Mendez."</p>

<p>"Isn't it necessary for a girl to read&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to be ignorant. Besides, I'm&mdash;curious to know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Be decently curious, dearest. There's a danger mark; don't cross
it."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to."</p>

<p>She stretched out her arms, crop in hand, doubled them back,
and head tipped on one side, yawned shamelessly at her own laziness.</p>

<p>"Scott is becoming very restless," she said.</p>

<p>"About going away?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I really do think, Kathleen, that we ought to have some
respectable country place to go to. It would be nice for Scott
and the servants and the horses; and you and I need not stay there
if it bores us&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Is he still thinking of that Roya-Neh place? It's horridly expensive
to keep up. Oh, I knew quite well that Scott would bully you into
consenting&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Roya-Neh seems to suit us both," admitted the girl indifferently.
"The shooting and fishing naturally attract Scott; they say it's
secluded enough for you and me to recuperate in; and if we ever
want any guests, it's big enough to entertain dozens in.... I
really don't care one way or the other; you know I never was very
crazy about the country&mdash;and poison ivy, and mosquitoes and oil-smelling
roads, and hot nights, and the perfume of fertilisers&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You poor child!" laughed Kathleen; "you don't know anything
about the country except where you've been on Long Island in the
immediate vicinity of your grandfather's horrid old place."</p>

<p>"Is it any more agreeable up there near Canada?"</p>

<p>"Roya-Neh is very lovely&mdash;of course&mdash;but&mdash;it's certainly not
a wise investment, dear."</p>

<p>"Well, if Scott and I buy it, we'd never wish to sell it&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Suppose you were obliged to?"</p>

<p>Geraldine's velvet eyes widened lazily:</p>

<p>"Obliged to? Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;you mean if we went to smash."</p>

<p>Then her gaze became remote as she stood slowly tapping her gloved
palm with her riding-crop.</p>

<p>"I think I'll dress," she said absently.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, then," nodded Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said the girl, turning lightly away across the hall.
Kathleen's eyes followed the slender retreating figure, so slimly
compact in its buoyancy. There was always something fascinatingly
boyish in Geraldine's light, free carriage&mdash;just a touch of carelessness
in the poise&mdash;almost a swing at times to the step. Duane had once
said: "She has a bully walk!" Kathleen thought of it as, passing
a mirror, she caught sight of herself. And the sudden glimpse
of her own warm, rich beauty in all its exquisite maturity startled
her. Surely she seemed to be growing younger.</p>

<p>She was. Dark-violet eyes, ruddy hair, a superb figure, a skin
so white that it looked fragrant, made Kathleen Severn amazingly
attractive. Men found her, to their surprise, rather unresponsive.
She was amiable enough, nicely formal, and perfectly bred, it
is true, but inclined to that sort of aloofness which is marked
by lapses of inattention and the smiling silences of preoccupation.</p>

<p>She had married, very young, an army officer convalescing from
Texan fever. He died suddenly on the very eve of their postponed
wedding-trip. This was enough to account for lapses of inattention
in any woman.</p>

<p>But Kathleen Severn had never been demonstrative. She was slow
to care for people. Besides, the responsibility of bringing up
the Seagrave twins had been sufficient to subdue anybody's spirits.
She was only nineteen and a widow of a month when her distant
relative, Magnelius Grandcourt, found her the position as personal
guardian of the twins, then aged nine. Now they were twenty-one
and she thirty-one; twelve years of service, twelve years of steady
fidelity, which long ago had become a changeless and passionate
devotion, made up of all she might have given to the dead, and
of the unborn happiness she had never known. What other sort of
love, if there was any, lay within her undeveloped, nobody knew
because nobody had ever aroused it.</p>

<p>Sunshine transformed into great golden transparencies the lowered
shades in the living room where Geraldine stood, pensive, distraite,
idly twirling her crop by the loop. Presently it flew off her
gloved forefinger and fell clattering across the carpetless floor.
She bathed and dressed leisurely; later, when luncheon was brought
to her, she dropped into a low, wide chair and, ignoring everything
except the strawberries, turned her face to the breeze which was
softly rattling the southern curtains.</p>

<p>Errant thoughts, light as summer fleece, drifted across her mind.
Often, in such moments, she strove to realise that she was now
mistress of herself; but never could completely.</p>

<p>"For example: if I want to buy Roya-Neh," she mused, biting into
an enormous strawberry, "I can do it.... All I have to do is to
say that I'll buy it.... And I can live there if I choose&mdash;as
long as I choose.... It's a very agreeable sensation.... I can
have anything I fancy, without asking Mr. Tappan.... It's rather
odd that I don't want anything."</p>

<p>She crossed her ankles and lay back watching the sun-moats floating.</p>

<p>"Suppose," she murmured with perverse humour, "that I wished
to build a bungalow in Timbuctoo ... or stand on my head, now,
this very moment! Nobody on earth could stop me.... I believe
I <em>will</em> stand on my head for a change."</p>

<p>The sudden smile made the curve of her cheek delicious. She sprang
to her feet, spread her napkin on the polished floor, then gravely
bending double, placed both palms flat on the square of damask,
balanced and raised her body until the straight, slim limbs were
rigidly pointed toward heaven.</p>

<p>Down tumbled her hair; her cheeks crimsoned; then dainty as a
lithe and spangled athlete, she turned clean over in the air,
landing lightly on both feet breathing fast.</p>

<p>"It's disgraceful!" she murmured; "I am certainly out of condition.
Late hours are my undoing. Also cigarettes. I wish I didn't like
to smoke."</p>

<p>She lighted one and strolled about the room, knotting up her
dark hair, heels clicking sharply over the bare, polished floor.</p>

<p>Lacking a hair-peg, she sauntered off to her own apartments to
find one, where she remained, lolling in the chaise-longue, alternately
blowing smoke rings into the sunshine and nibbling a bonbon soaked
in cologne. Only a girl can accomplish such combinations. How
she ever began this silly custom of hers she couldn't remember,
except that, when a small child, somebody had forbidden her to
taste brandied peach syrup, which she adored; and the odour of
cologne being similarly pleasant, she had tried it on her palate
and found that it produced agreeable sensations.</p>

<p>It had become a habit. She was conscious of it, but remained
indifferent because she didn't know anything about habits.</p>

<p>So all that sunny afternoon she lay in the chaise-longue, alternately
reading and dreaming, her scented bonbons at her elbow. Later
a maid brought tea; and a little later Duane Mallett was announced.
He sauntered in, a loosely knit, graceful figure, still wearing
his riding-clothes and dusty boots of the morning.</p>

<p>Geraldine Seagrave had had time enough to discover, during the
past winter, that her old playfellow was not at all the kind of
man he appeared to be. Women liked him too easily and he liked
them without effort. There was always some girl in love with him
until he was found kissing another. His tastes were amiably catholic;
his caress instinctively casual. Beauty when responsive touched
him. No girl he knew needed to remain unconsoled.</p>

<p>The majority of women liked him; so did Geraldine Seagrave. The
majority instinctively watched him; so did she. In close acquaintance
the man was a disappointment. It seemed as though there ought
to be something deeper in him than the lightly humourous mockery
with which he seemed to regard his very great talent&mdash;a flippancy
that veiled always what he said and did and thought until nobody
could clearly understand what he really thought about anything;
and some people doubted that he thought at all&mdash;particularly the
thoughtless whom he had carelessly consoled.</p>

<p>Women were never entirely indifferent concerning him; there remained
always a certain amount of curiosity, whether they found him attractive
or otherwise.</p>

<p>His humourous indifference to public opinions, bordering on effrontery,
was not entirely unattractive to women, but it always, sooner
or later, aroused their distrust.</p>

<p>The main trouble with Duane Mallett seemed to be his gaily cynical
willingness to respond to any advance, however slight, that any
pretty woman offered. This responsive partiality was disconcerting
enough to make him dreaded by ambitious mothers, and an object
of uneasy interest to their decorative offspring who were inclined
to believe that a rescue party of one might bring this derelict
into port and render him seaworthy for the voyage of life under
their own particular command.</p>

<p>Besides, he was a painter. Women like them when they are carefully
washed and clothed.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>As Duane Mallett strolled into the living-room, Geraldine felt
again, as she so often did, a slight sense of insecurity mingle
with her liking for the man, or what might have been liking if
she could ever feel absolute confidence in him. She had been,
at times, very close to caring a great deal for him, when now
and again it flashed over her that there must be in him something
serious under his brilliant talent and the idle perversity which
mocked at it.</p>

<p>But now she recognised in his smile and manner everything that
kept her from ever caring to understand him&mdash;the old sense of
insecurity in his ironical formality; and her outstretched hand
fell away from his with indifference.</p>

<p>"I didn't have the happiness of riding with you, after all,"
he said, serenely seating himself and dropping one lank knee over
the other. "Promises wouldn't be valuable unless somebody broke
a lot now and then."</p>

<p>"You probably had the happiness of riding with some other woman."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Who, this time?"</p>

<p>"Rosalie Dysart."</p>

<p>Rumour had been busy with their names recently. The girl's face
became expressionless.</p>

<p>"Sorry you didn't come," he said, looking out of the window where
the flapping shade revealed a lilac in bloom.</p>

<p>"How long did you wait for me?"</p>

<p>"About a minute. Then Rosalie passed&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Rosalies will always continue to pass through your career, my
omnivorous friend.... Did it even occur to you to ride over here
and find out why I missed our appointment?"</p>

<p>"No; why didn't you come?"</p>

<p>"Bibi went lame. I'd have had another horse saddled if I hadn't
seen you, over my shoulder, join Mrs. Dysart."</p>

<p>"Too bad," he commented listlessly.</p>

<p>"Why? You had a perfectly good time without me, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, pretty good. Delancy Grandcourt was out after luncheon,
and when Rosalie left he stuck to me and talked about you until
I let my horse bolt, and it stirred up a few mounted policemen
and riding-schools, I can tell you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, so you lunched with Mrs. Dysart?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Where is Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"Driving," said the girl briefly. "If you don't care for any
tea, there is mineral water and a decanter over there."</p>

<p>He thanked her, rose and mixed himself what he wanted, and began
to walk leisurely about, the ice tinkling in the glass which he
held. At intervals he quenched his thirst, then resumed his aimless
promenade, a slight smile on his face.</p>

<p>"Has anything particularly interesting happened to you, Duane?"
she asked, and somehow thought of Rosalie Dysart.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How are your pictures coming on?"</p>

<p>"The portrait?" he asked absently.</p>

<p>"Portrait? I thought all the very grand ladies you paint had
left town. Whose portrait are you painting?"</p>

<p>Before he answered, before he even hesitated, she knew.</p>

<p>"Rosalie Dysart's," he said, gazing absently at the lilac-bush
in flower as the wind-blown curtain revealed it for a moment.</p>

<p>She lifted her dark eyes curiously. He began to stir the ice
in his glass with a silver paper-cutter.</p>

<p>"She is wonderfully beautiful, isn't she?" said the girl.</p>

<p>"Overwhelmingly."</p>

<p>Geraldine shrugged and gazed into space. She didn't exactly know
why she had given that little hitch to her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I'd like to paint Kathleen," he observed.</p>

<p>A flush tinted the girl's cheeks. She said nervously:</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask her?"</p>

<p>"I've meant to. Somehow, one doesn't ask things lightly of Kathleen."</p>

<p>"One doesn't ask things of some women at all," she remarked.</p>

<p>He looked up; she was examining her empty teacup with fixed interest.</p>

<p>"Ask what sort of thing?" he inquired, walking over to the table
and resting his glass on it.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know what I meant. Nothing. What is that in your
glass? Let me taste it.... Ugh! It's Scotch!"</p>

<p>She set back the glass with a shudder. After a few moments she
picked it up again and tasted it disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Do you like this?" she demanded with youthful contempt.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," he admitted.</p>

<p>"It tastes something like brandied peaches, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"I never noticed that it did."</p>

<p>And as he remained smilingly aloof and silent, at intervals,
tentatively, uncertain whether or not she exactly cared for it,
she tasted the iced contents of the tall, frosty glass and watched
him where he sat loosely at ease flicking at sun-moats with the
loop of his riding-crop.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see a typical studio," she said reflectively.</p>

<p>"I've asked you to mine often enough."</p>

<p>"Yes, to tea with other people. I don't mean that way. I'd like
to see it when it's not all dusted and in order for feminine inspection.
I'd like to see a man's studio when it's in shape for work&mdash;with
the gr-r-reat painter in a fine frenzy painting, and the model
posing madly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Come on, then! If Kathleen lets you, and you can stand it, come
down and knock some day unexpectedly."</p>

<p>"O Duane! I <em>couldn't</em>, could I?"</p>

<p>"Not with propriety. But come ahead."</p>

<p>"Naturally, impropriety appeals to you."</p>

<p>"Naturally. To you, too, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"No. But wouldn't it astonish you if you heard a low, timid knocking
some day when you and your Bohemian friends were carousing and
having a riotous time there&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it would, but I'm afraid that low, timid knocking couldn't
be heard in the infernal uproar of our usual revelry."</p>

<p>"Then I'd knock louder and louder, and perhaps kick once or twice
if you didn't come to the door and let me in."</p>

<p>He laughed. After a moment she laughed, too; her dark eyes were
very friendly now. Watching the amusement in his face, she continued
to sip from his tall, frosted glass, quite unconscious of any
distaste for it. On the contrary, she experienced a slight exhilaration
which was gradually becoming delightful to her.</p>

<p>"Scotch-and-soda is rather nice, after all," she observed. "I
had no idea&mdash;<em>What</em> is the matter with you, Duane?"</p>

<p>"You haven't swallowed all that, have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, is it much?"</p>

<p>He stared, then with a shrug: "You'd better cut out that sort
of thing."</p>

<p>"What?" she asked, surprised.</p>

<p>"What you're doing."</p>

<p>"Tasting your Scotch? Pooh!" she said, "it isn't strong. Do you
think I'm a baby?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead," he said, "it's your funeral."</p>

<p>Legs crossed, chin resting on the butt of his riding-crop, he
lay back in his chair watching her.</p>

<p>Women of her particular type had always fascinated him; Fifth
Avenue is thronged with them in sunny winter mornings&mdash;tall, slender,
faultlessly gowned girls, free-limbed, narrow of wrist and foot;
cleanly built, engaging, fearless-eyed; and Geraldine was one
of a type characteristic of that city and of the sunny Avenue
where there pass more beautiful women on a December morning than
one can see abroad in half a dozen years' residence.</p>

<p>How on earth this hemisphere has managed to evolve them out of
its original material nobody can explain. And young Mallett, recently
from the older hemisphere, was still in a happy trance of surprise
at the discovery.</p>

<p>Lounging there, watching her where she sat warmly illumined by
the golden light of the window-shade, he said lazily:</p>

<p>"Do you know that Fifth Avenue is always thronged with you, Geraldine?
I've nearly twisted my head off trying not to miss the assorted
visions of you which float past afoot or driving. Some day one
of them will unbalance me. I'll leap into her victoria, ask her
if she'd mind the temporary inconvenience of being adored by a
stranger; and if she's a good sport she'll take a chance. Don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>"It's more than I'd take with you," said the girl.</p>

<p>"You've said that several times."</p>

<p>He laughed, then looked up at her half humorously, half curiously.</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> would be taking no chances, Geraldine."</p>

<p>"I'd be taking chances of finding you holding some other girl's
hands within twenty-four hours. And you know it."</p>

<p>"Hasn't anybody ever held yours?"</p>

<p>Displeasure tinted her cheeks a deeper red, but she merely shrugged
her shoulders.</p>

<p>It was true that in the one evanescent and secret affair of her
first winter she had not escaped the calf-like transports of Bunbury
Gray. She had felt, if she had not returned them, the furtively
significant pressure of men's hands in the gaiety and whirl of
things; ardent and chuckle-headed youth had declared itself in
conservatories and in corners; one impetuous mauling from a smitten
Harvard boy of eighteen had left her furiously vexed with herself
for her passive attitude while the tempest passed. True, she had
vigorously reproved him later. She had, alas, occasion, during
her first season, to reprove several demonstrative young men for
their unconventionally athletic manner of declaring their suits.
She had been far more severe with the humble, unattractive, and
immobile, however, than with the audacious and ornamental who
had attempted to take her by storm. A sudden if awkward kiss followed
by the fiery declaration of the hot-headed disturbed her less
than the persistent stare of an enamoured pair of eyes. As a child
the description of an assault on a citadel always interested her,
but she had neither sympathy nor interest in a siege.</p>

<p>Now, musing there in the sunlight on the events of her first
winter, she became aware that she had been more or less instructed
in the ways of men; and, remembering, she lifted her disturbed
eyes to inspect this specimen of a sex which often perplexed but
always interested her.</p>

<p>"What are you smiling about, Duane?" she asked defiantly.</p>

<p>"Your arraignment of me when half the men in town have been trying
to marry you all winter. You've made a reputation for yourself,
too, Geraldine."</p>

<p>"As what?" she asked angrily.</p>

<p>"A head-twister."</p>

<p>"Do you mean a flirt?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! Only the French use that term now. But that's the
idea, Geraldine. You are a born one. I fell for the first smile
you let loose on me."</p>

<p>"You seem to have been a sort of general Humpty Dumpty for falls
all your life, Duane," she said with dangerous sweetness.</p>

<p>"Like that immortal, I've had only one which permanently shattered
me."</p>

<p>"Which was that, if you please?"</p>

<p>"The fall you took out of me."</p>

<p>"In other words," she said disdainfully, "you are beginning to
make love to me again."</p>

<p>"No.... I <em>was</em> in love with you."</p>

<p>"You were in love with yourself, young man. You are on such excellent
terms with yourself that you sympathise too ardently with any
attractive woman who takes the least and most innocent notice
of you."</p>

<p>He said, very much amused: "I was perfectly serious over you,
Geraldine."</p>

<p>"The selfish always take themselves seriously."</p>

<p>It was she, however, who now sat there bright-eyed and unsmiling,
and he was still laughing, deftly balancing his crop on one finger,
and glancing at her from time to time with that glimmer of ever-latent
mockery which always made her restive at first, then irritated
her with an unreasoning desire to hurt him somehow. But she never
seemed able to reach him.</p>

<p>"Sooner or later," she said, "women will find you out, thoroughly."</p>

<p>"And then, just think what a rush there will be to marry me!"</p>

<p>"There will be a rush to avoid you, Duane. And it will set in
before you know it&mdash;" She thought of the recent gossip coupling
his name with Rosalie's, reddened and bit her lip in silence.
But somehow the thought irritated her into speech again:</p>

<p>"Fortunately, I was among the first to find you out&mdash;the first,
I think."</p>

<p>"Heavens! when was that?" he asked in pretended concern, which
infuriated her.</p>

<p>"You had better not ask me," she flashed back. "When a woman
suddenly discovers that a man is untrustworthy, do you think she
ever forgets it?"</p>

<p>"Because I once kissed you? What a dreadful deed!"</p>

<p>"You forget the circumstances under which you did it."</p>

<p>He flushed; she had managed to hurt him, after all. He began
patiently:</p>

<p>"I've explained to you a dozen times that I didn't know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But I <em>told</em> you!"</p>

<p>"And I couldn't believe you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But you expect me to believe <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>He could not exactly interpret her bright, smiling, steady gaze.</p>

<p>"The trouble with you is," she said, "that there is nothing to
you but good looks and talent. There was once, but it died&mdash;over
in Europe&mdash;somewhere. No woman trusts a man like you. Don't you
know it?"</p>

<p>His smile did not seem to be very genuine, but he answered lightly:</p>

<p>"When I ask people to have confidence in me, it will be time
for them to pitch into me."</p>

<p>"Didn't you once ask me for your confidence&mdash;and then abuse it?"
she demanded.</p>

<p>"I told you I loved you&mdash;if that is what you mean. And you doubted
it so strenuously that, perhaps I might be excused for doubting
it myself.... What is the use of talking this way, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>There was a ring of exasperation in her laughter. She lifted
his glass, sipped a little, and, looking over it at him:</p>

<p>"I drink to our doubts concerning each other: may nothing ever
occur to disturb them."</p>

<p>Her cheeks had begun to burn, her eyes were too bright, her voice
unmodulated.</p>

<p>"Whether or not you ever again take the trouble to ask me to
trust you in that way," she said, "I'll tell you now why I don't
and why I never could. It may amuse you. Shall I?"</p>

<p>"By all means," he replied amiably; "but it seems to me as though
you are rather rough on me."</p>

<p>"You were rougher with me the first time I saw you, after all
those years. I met you with perfect confidence, remembering what
you once were. It was my first grown-up party. I was only a fool
of a girl, merely ignorant, unfit to be trusted with a liberty
I'd never before had.... And I took one glass of champagne and
it&mdash;you know what it did.... And I was bewildered and frightened,
and I told you; and&mdash;you perhaps remember how my confidence in
my old play-fellow was requited. Do you?"</p>

<p>Reckless impulse urged her on. Heart and pulses were beating
very fast with a persistent desire to hurt him. Her animation,
brilliant colour, her laughter seemed to wing every word like
an arrow. She knew he shrank from what she was saying, in spite
of his polite attention, and her fresh, curved cheek and parted
lips took on a brighter tint. Something was singing, seething
in her veins. She lifted her glass, set it down, and suddenly
pushed it from her so violently that it fell with a crash. A wave
of tingling heat mounted to her face, receded, swept back again.
Confused, she straightened up in her chair, breathing fast. <em>What</em>
was coming over her? Again the wave surged back with a deafening
rush; her senses struggled, the blood in her ran riot. Then terror
clutched her. Neither lips nor tongue were very flexible when
she spoke.</p>

<p>"Duane&mdash;if you don't mind&mdash;would you go away now? I've a wretched
headache."</p>

<p>He shrugged and stood up.</p>

<p>"It's curious," he said reflectively, "how utterly determined
we seem to be to misunderstand each other. If you would give me
half a chance&mdash;well&mdash;never mind."</p>

<p>"I wish you would go," she murmured, "I really am not well."
She could scarcely hear her own voice amid the deafening tumult
of her pulses. Fright stiffened the fixed smile on her lips. Her
plight paralysed her for a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll go," he answered, smiling. "I usually am going somewhere&mdash;most
of the time."</p>

<p>He picked up hat, gloves, and crop, looked down at her, came
and stood at the table, resting one hand on the edge.</p>

<p>"We're pretty young yet, Geraldine.... I never saw a girl I cared
for as I might have cared for you. It's true, no matter what I
have done, or may do.... But you're quite right, a man of that
sort isn't to be considered"&mdash;he laughed and pulled on one glove&mdash;"only
&mdash;I knew as soon as I saw you that it was to be you or&mdash;everybody.
First, it was anybody; then it was you&mdash;now it's everybody. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she managed to say. The dizzy waves swayed her; she
rested her cheeks between both hands and, leaning there heavily,
closed her eyes to fight against it. She had been seated on the
side of a lounge; and now, feeling blindly behind her, she moved
the cushions aside, turned and dropped among them, burying her
blazing face. Over her the scorching vertigo swept, subsided,
rose, and swept again. Oh, the horror of it!&mdash;the shame, the agonised
surprise. What was this dreadful thing that, for the second time,
she had unwittingly done? And this time it was so much more terrible.
How could such an accident have happened to her? How could she
face her own soul in the disgrace of it?</p>

<p>Fear, loathing, frightened incredulity that this could really
be herself, stiffened her body and clinched her hands under her
parted lips. On them her hot breath fell irregularly.</p>

<p>Rigid, motionless, she lay, breathing faster and more feverishly.
Tears came after a long while, and with them relaxation and lassitude.
She felt that the dreadful thing which had seized and held her
was letting go its hold, was freeing her body and mind; and as
it slowly released her and passed on its terrible silent way,
she awoke and sat up with a frightened cry&mdash;to find herself lying
on her own bed in utter darkness.</p>

<p>A moment later her bedroom door opened without a sound and the
light from the hall streamed over Kathleen's bare shoulders and
braided hair.</p>

<p>"Geraldine?"</p>

<p>The girl scarcely recognised Kathleen's altered voice. She lay
listening, silent, motionless, staring at the white figure.</p>

<p>"Dearest, I thought you called me. May I come in?"</p>

<p>"I am not well."</p>

<p>But Kathleen entered and stood beside the bed, looking down at
her in the dim light.</p>

<p>"Dearest," she began tremulously, "Duane told me you had a headache
and had gone to your room to lie down, so I didn't disturb you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Duane," faltered the girl, "is he here? What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He was in the library before dinner when I came in, and he warned
me not to waken you. Do you know what time it is?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It is after midnight.... If you feel ill enough to lie here,
you ought to be undressed. May I help you?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. For a moment Kathleen stood looking down
at the girl in silence; then a sudden shivering seized her; she
strove to control it, but her knees seemed to give way under it
and she dropped down beside the bed, throwing both arms around
Geraldine's neck.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Oh, the horror of it!&mdash;the shame, the agonised
surprise."]</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, <em>don't</em>!" she whimpered. "It is too terrible!
It ruined your father and your grandfather! Darling, I couldn't
bear to tell you this before, but now I've got to tell you! It
is in your blood. Seagraves die of it! Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"W-what?" stammered the girl.</p>

<p>"That all their lives they did what&mdash;what you have done to-day&mdash;that
you have inherited their terrible inclinations. Even as a little
child you frightened me. Have you forgotten what you and I talked
over and cried over after your first party?"</p>

<p>The girl said slowly: "I don't know how&mdash;it&mdash;happened, Kathleen.
Duane came in.... I tasted what he had in his glass.... I don't
know why I did it. I wish I were dead!"</p>

<p>"There is only one thing to do&mdash;never to touch anything&mdash;anything&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Y-yes, I know that I must not. But how was I to know before?
Will you tell me?"</p>

<p>"You understand <em>now</em>, thank God!"</p>

<p>"N-not exactly.... Other girls seem to do as they please without
danger.... It is amazing that such a horrible thing should happen
to me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It is a shameful thing that it should happen to any woman. And
the horror of it is that almost every hostess in town lets girls
of your age run the risk. Darling, don't you know that the only
chance a woman has with the world is in her self-control? When
that goes, her chances go, every one of them! Dear&mdash;we have latent
in us much the same vices that men have. We have within us the
same possibilities of temptations, the same capacity for excesses,
the same capabilities for resistance. Because you are a girl,
you are not immune from unworthy desires."</p>

<p>"I know it. The&mdash;the dreadful thing about it is that I do desire
such things. Perhaps I had better not even nibble sugar scented
with cologne&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you do <em>that</em>?" faltered Kathleen.</p>

<p>"I did not know there was any danger in it," sobbed the girl.
"You have scared me terribly, Kathleen."</p>

<p>"Is that true about the cologne?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes."</p>

<p>"You don't do it now, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You don't do it every day, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, several times."</p>

<p>"How long" &mdash;Kathleen's lips almost refused to move&mdash;"how
long have you done this?"</p>

<p>"For a long time. I've been ashamed of it. It's&mdash;it's the alcohol
in it that I like, isn't it? I never thought of it in that way
till now."</p>

<p>Kathleen, on her knees by the bedside, was crying silently. The
girl slipped from her arms, turned partly over, and lying on her
back, stared upward through the darkness.</p>

<p>So this was the secret reason that, unsuspected, had long been
stirring her to instinctive uneasiness, which had made her half
ashamed, half impatient with this silly habit which already inconvenienced
her. Yet even now she could not feel any real alarm; she could
not understand that the fangs of a habit can poison when plucked
out. Of course there was now only one thing to do&mdash;keep aloof
from everything. That would be easy. The tingling warmth of the
perfume was certainly agreeable, but she must not risk even such
a silly indulgence as that. Really, it was a very simple matter.
She sat up, supporting her weight on one arm.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, darling," she whispered, bending forward and drawing
the elder woman up onto the bed, "you mustn't be frightened about
me. I've learned some things I didn't know. Do you think Duane&mdash;"
In the darkness the blood scorched her face, the humiliation almost
crushed her. But she went on: "Do you think Duane suspects that&mdash;that&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I don't think Duane suspects anything," said Kathleen, striving
to steady her voice. "You came in here as soon as you felt&mdash;ill;
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>yes&#11834;"</p>

<p>She could say no more. How she came to be on her bed in her own
room she could not remember. It seemed to her as though she had
fallen asleep on the lounge. Somehow, after Duane had gone, she
must have waked and gone to her own room. But she could not recollect
doing it.</p>

<p>Now she realised that she was tired, wretched, feverish. She
suffered Kathleen to undress her, comb her hair, bathe her, and
dry the white, slender body and limbs in which the veins still
burned and throbbed.</p>

<p>When at length she lay between the cool sheets, silent, limp,
heavy-lidded, Kathleen turned out the electric brackets and lighted
the candle.</p>

<p>"Dear," she said, trying to speak cheerfully, "do you know what
your brother has done?"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Geraldine drowsily.</p>

<p>"He has bought Roya-Neh, if you please, and he invites you to
draw a check for half of it and to move there next week. As for
me, I was furious with him. What do you think?"</p>

<p>Her voice softened to a whisper; she bent over the girl, looking
closely at the closed lids. Under them a faint bluish tint faded
into the whiteness of the cheek.</p>

<p>"Darling, darling!" whispered Kathleen, bending closer over the
sleeping girl, "I love you so &mdash;I love you so!" And even
as she said it, between the sleeper's features and her own floated
the vision of Scott's youthfully earnest face; and she straightened
suddenly to her full height and laid her hand on her breast in
consternation. Under the fingers' soft pressure her heart beat
faster. Again, with new dismay, this incredible sensation was
stealing upon her, threatening to transform itself into something
real, something definite, something not to be stifled or ignored.</p>

<p>She extinguished the candle; as she felt her way out of the darkness,
arms extended, far away in the house she heard a door open and
shut, and she bent over the balustrade to listen.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Scott?" she called softly.</p>

<p>"Yes; Duane and I did some billiards at the club." He looked
up at her, the same slight pucker between his brows, boyishly
slender in his evening dress. "You're not going to bed at once,
are you, Kathleen, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," she said briefly, backing into her own room, but
holding the door ajar so that she could look out at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, come out and talk to a fellow," he urged; "I'm quite excited
about this Roya-Neh business&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You're a perfect wretch, Scott. I don't want to talk about your
unholy extravagance."</p>

<p>The boy laughed and stood at ease looking at the pretty face
partly disclosed between door and wall with darkness for a velvety
background.</p>

<p>"Just come out into the library while I smoke one cigarette,"
he began in his wheedling way. "I'm dying to talk to you about
the game-preserve&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I can't; I'm not attired for a tête-à-tête with anything except
my pillow."</p>

<p>"Then put on one of those fetching affairs you wear sometimes&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Scott, you are a nuisance!"</p>

<p>When, a few moments later, she came into the library in a delicate
shimmering thing and little slippers of the same elusive tint,
Scott jumped up and dragged a big chair forward.</p>

<p>"You certainly are stunning, Kathleen," he said frankly; "you
look twenty with all the charm of thirty. Sit here; I've a map
of the Roya-Neh forest to show you."</p>

<p>He drew up a chair for himself, lifted a big map from the table,
and, unrolling it, laid it across her knees. Then he began to
talk enthusiastically about lake and stream and mountain, and
about wild boar and deer and keepers and lodges; and she bent
her pretty head over the map, following his moving pencil with
her eyes, sometimes asking a question, sometimes tracing a road
with her own delicate finger.</p>

<p>Once or twice it happened that their hands touched en passant;
and at the light contact, she was vaguely aware that somewhere,
deep within her, the same faint dismay awoke; that in her, buried
in depths unsuspected, something incredible existed, stirred,
threatened.</p>

<p>"Scott, dear," she said quietly, "I am glad you are happy over
Roya-Neh forest, but it <em>was</em> too expensive, and it troubles
me; so I'm going to sleep to dream over it."</p>

<p>"You sweet little goose!" laughed the boy impulsively, passing
his arm around her. He had done it so often to this nurse and
mother.</p>

<p>They both rose abruptly; the map dropped; his arm fell away from
her warm, yielding body.</p>

<p>He gazed at her flushed face rather stupidly, not realising yet
that the mother and nurse and elder sister had vanished like a
tinted bubble in that strange instant&mdash;that Kathleen was gone&mdash;that,
in her calm, sweet, familiar guise stood a woman&mdash;a stranger,
exquisite, youthful, with troubled violet eyes and vivid lips,
looking at him as though for the first time she had met his gaze
across the world.</p>

<p>She recovered her composure instantly.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Scott, but I'm too sleepy to talk any more. Besides,
Geraldine isn't very well, and I'm going to doze with one eye
open. Good-night, dear."</p>

<p>"Good-night," said the boy vacantly, not offering the dutiful
embrace to which he and she had so long and so lightly been accustomed.</p>
