<p>"Thief, thief, thief! Thief, thief, thief!" Sammy Jay was screaming
at the top of his lungs, as he followed Buster Bear across the
Old Pasture towards the Green Forest. Never had he screamed so
loud, and never had his voice sounded so excited. The little people
of the Green Forest, the Green Meadows, and the Smiling Pool are
so used to hearing Sammy cry thief that usually they think very
little about it. But every blessed one who heard Sammy this morning
stopped whatever he was doing and pricked up his ears to listen.</p>

<p>Sammy's cousin, Blacky the Crow, just happened to be flying along
the edge of the Old Pasture, and the minute he heard Sammy's voice,
he turned and flew over to see what it was all about. Just as
soon as he caught sight of Buster Bear running for the Green Forest
as hard as ever he could, he understood what had excited Sammy
so. He was so surprised that he almost forgot to keep his wings
moving. Buster Bear had what looked to Blacky very much like a
tin pail hanging from his neck! No wonder Sammy was excited. Blacky
beat his wings fiercely and started after Sammy.</p>

<p>And so they reached the edge of the Green Forest, Buster Bear
running as hard as ever he could, Sammy Jay flying just behind
him and screaming, "Thief, thief, thief!" at the top of his lungs,
and behind him Blacky the Crow, trying to catch up and yelling
as loud as he could, "Caw, caw, caw! Come on, everybody! Come
on! Come on!"</p>

<p>Poor Buster! It was bad enough to be frightened almost to death
as he had been up in the Old Pasture when the pail had caught
over his head just as Farmer Brown's boy had yelled at him. Then
to have the handle of the pail slip down around his neck so that
he couldn't get rid of the pail but had to take it with him as
he ran, was making a bad matter worse. Now to have all his neighbors
of the Green Forest see him in such a fix and make fun of him,
was more than he could stand. He felt humiliated. That is just
another way of saying shamed. Yes, Sir, Buster felt that he was
shamed in the eyes of his neighbors, and he wanted nothing so
much as to get away by himself, where no one could see him, and
try to get rid of that dreadful pail. But Buster is so big that
it is not easy for him to find a hiding place. So, when he reached
the Green Forest, he kept right on to the deepest, darkest, most
lonesome part and crept under the thickest hemlock-tree he could
find.</p>

<p>But it was of no use. The sharp eyes of Sammy Jay and Blacky
the Crow saw him. They actually flew into the very tree under
which he was hiding, and how they did scream! Pretty soon Ol'
Mistah Buzzard came dropping down out of the blue, blue sky and
took a seat on a convenient dead tree, where he could see all
that went on. Ol' Mistah Buzzard began to grin as soon as he saw
that tin pail on Buster's neck. Then came others, &mdash;Redtail
the Hawk, Scrapper the Kingbird, Redwing the Blackbird, Drummer
the Woodpecker, Welcome Robin, Tommy Tit the Chickadee, Jenny
Wren, Redeye the Vireo, and ever so many more. They came from
the Old Orchard, the Green Meadows, and even down by the Smiling
Pool, for the voices of Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow carried
far, and at the sound of them everybody hurried over, sure that
something exciting was going on.</p>

<p>Presently Buster heard light footsteps, and peeping out, he saw
Billy Mink and Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and Prickly Porky
and Reddy Fox and Jimmy Skunk. Even timid little Whitefoot the
Wood Mouse was where he could peer out and see without being seen.
Of course, Chatterer the Red Squirrel and Happy Jack the Gray
Squirrel were there. There they all sat in a great circle around
him, each where he felt safe, but where he could see, and every
one of them laughing and making fun of Buster.</p>

<p>"Thief, thief, thief!" screamed Sammy until his throat was sore.
The worst of it was Buster knew that everybody knew that it was
true. That awful pail was proof of it.</p>

<p>"I wish I never had thought of berries," growled Buster to himself.</p>
