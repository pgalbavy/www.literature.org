<p>As we have intimated in another place, old Stebbins and Black
Tom were veteran trappers who had been in the "profession" a goodly
number of years. Both men had families in Independence, Missouri;
and, as the incidents we are giving are supposed to have occurred
fully a score of years ago, it will be seen that they were engaged
in a most dangerous business.</p>

<p>But they had grown so accustomed to its hardships and perils,
that when they left home in each autumn, they felt scarcely different
from the traveling-agent, who starts upon his tour of several
weeks. Both were strongly attached to their wives and children,
and were free from the rough, careless habits of dissipation that
so often distinguish such men.</p>

<p>In the spring preceding the opening of our story, the two trappers
and Teddy O’Doherty were returning homeward with a plentiful supply
of peltries, having three horses, besides those they rode, laden
down with them, and they were in the highest spirits at the success
of their winter’s work. Reaching a point a short distance from
where we saw them encamped, they halted for the night.</p>

<p>Nothing unusual occurred during the night; but in the morning,
when old Stebbins went to a small rivulet near by to drink, he
discovered a number of shining particles in the sand, which he
instantly recognized as gold. He instituted an examination, and
found that in several places it was quite abundant, showing that
it would amply repay working. He returned to the camp with the
information, when Black Tom came in with confirmatory evidence.
Near the spot where his comrade had leaned down to drink, he had
accidentally loosened a large, flat stone, which he overturned
and found any quantity of the auriferous particles. Putting this
and that together, the trio came to the conclusion that they had
accidentally struck a "gold mine," and that with care and industry
they could easily make their fortune.</p>

<p>The question was then discussed whether they should remain where
they were, and follow up the prize that was so nearly in their
grasp. Teddy O’Doherty was strongly in favor of it, but the two
hunters had families who would look anxiously for them if they
overstaid their time, and they had a load of peltries, very valuable,
that made the "bird in the hand," and they were anxious to dispose
of them before returning upon any other undertaking.</p>

<p>So, after a careful consideration of the matter, it was decided
to press on toward the States, to dispose of their stock, and
then return to prosecute their search for gold. This was done;
but the return of the hunters was much delayed by the sickness
of a child of old Stebbins, who was not considered out of danger
for several months. Finally, however, it recovered entirely, and
the three set out upon what was to prove a most eventful journey.</p>

<p>By this time it was late in summer, and would soon be time for
trapping operations to begin. But the three came without their
pack-horses, fully determined to devote all their energies to
the hunting for gold.</p>

<p>There was the one "lion in their path," the dreaded monster,
to which we have made such frequent reference, and which, it will
be remembered, was seen by them on their return trip homeward,
at the time of the discovery of gold.</p>

<p>Had old Stebbins and Black Tom been single men, it is very doubtful
whether the attraction of gold would have been sufficient to lead
them into a region that was known to contain such an anomaly;
but the prospect of placing their families in easy circumstances
for life drew them onward, and thus we find them prosecuting their
search for the precious metal in the face of such a hideous monster.</p>

<p>It is not often that a man finds a short and easy road to wealth;
and, besides the ever-threatening peril of the beast, they made
the unwelcome discovery that there were people in this region
ahead of them.</p>

<p>This proved that our friends were not alone in their knowledge
of the presence of gold in this secluded part of the world, and
it looked no ways improbable that they might encounter serious
opposition and trouble from them.</p>

<p>Thus they had the four-legged terror, the Blackfeet, and the
unknown white men to encounter before they could hope to go back
to the United States with "coffers filled."</p>

<p>It will be recollected that on the night of Teddy O’Doherty’s
first encounter with the brute, he saw and spoke to a strange
man that passed near him&mdash;a stranger who was on foot, and who
refused to pause and make known his identity to him.</p>

<p>The presence of this white man, they believed, indicated the
presence of others, and it thus behooved our friends to use the
utmost circumspection in their movements. They were scarcely a
half day’s journey from their destination, and it lacked yet an
hour or two of noon, when they reined up their horses for what
they intended should be the long halt.</p>

<p>Here was capital hunting-grounds, and it was only a few miles
beyond this where it was better, and where they had spent several
years in the business. There were hills and mountains, rivers,
streams, cañons, prairies, woods, and the most romantic diversification
of land; there were abundant places where they could approach
within a dozen feet of a foe, without seeing him.</p>

<p>They knew the ground well, and the wonder was that as gold seemed
to be all about them in such abundance, they had never detected
the indications of it before.</p>

<p>A secluded place was discovered, where their horses were turned
loose to roam free and get themselves in prime condition, while
their owners were seeking to put their pockets in the same healthy
state.</p>

<p>In a rude, cavern-like structure, made by the jumbling of immense
masses of rock together in a remote period of the world, the trappers
placed their saddles and luggage, while, carrying their rides
and spades, they set out upon a prospecting tour.</p>

<p>"I wonder if that ar’ critter is anywhar ’bout yer," remarked
Black Tom, as they moved away together.</p>

<p>"I don’t," replied old Stebbins.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"’Cause yonder he is this very minute."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the old hunter pointed upward to the top of a cliff,
full five hundred feet above them, and several hundred yards distant.
There, in full relief against the blue sky, stood the beast, his
ungainly body so strangely striped and ringed, and its appearance
so singular as to be almost indescribable.</p>

<p>For a minute the three men looked at it in silence, and then
Teddy O’Doherty removed his coonskin cap and made a low obeisance.</p>

<p>"What’s that for?" asked Black Tom.</p>

<p>"I s’lute him, jist as the gintry in Tipperary used to s’lute
me when they saw me ridin’ by on me own jackass, that belonged
to another man. The baast is a gintleman, so long as he uses me
in the shtyle of last night."</p>

<p>"You’d better keep cl’ar of him, so long as you can."</p>

<p>"I shan’t bother him, nor persoom too much on his good nature."</p>

<p>"’Sh! thar he goes."</p>

<p>From his high elevation came the faint sound of his peculiar
bark, and then the brute turned about, and was immediately lost
to view.</p>

<p>"Thar’s no tellin’ whar he’ll next turn up," said Stebbins, as
the three moved forward again.</p>

<p>"No; and I don’t believe when we meet him again, that we’ll get
off so easy as before," replied Black Tom.</p>

<p>The gold-hunters were now in a sort of deep cañon or rent in
the mountain, through which ran a small stream of icy-clear water.
It was this same rivulet that had displayed the golden particles
to old Stebbins, but it was at a point higher up, before it entered
into this wild region, and it was now the intention of the three
to follow up the stream for a considerable distance, searching
it carefully for the same precious metal that had drawn them hither.</p>

<p>In prospecting thus, it was evident that it was necessary to
keep a good look-out; and, as Teddy manifested such an appreciation
of the nameless brute, that task was deputized to him, while the
others were to scrutinize the bed of the small stream for what
had caused them to halt in this place.</p>

<p>For several hours the party made their way up the tiny brook
without discovering the first indications of gold; yet, they were
not discouraged by the fact, for they knew there was plenty of
it in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>They had almost reached the spot where they had seen it a few
months before, when Stebbins, who was slightly in advance halted,
and snuffed the air with the manner of one who scented something
suspicious.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Black Tom, failing to understand what it
meant.</p>

<p>"We’re near something dead&mdash;hello!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the old hunter pointed to a clump of bushes that
surmounted a mass of rocks and gravel, seemingly without any soil
to give them existence. From it a huge bird, gorged almost to
bursting, laboriously rose a few feet in the air, and floated
sluggishly down the cañon, a hundred yards or so, when it landed
upon a cliff, at a moderate elevation, and then stepped heavily
around, so as to face and watch the men that had disturbed him.</p>

<p>"That’s whar it is," said Tom, looking toward the bushes.</p>

<p>The next minute the three moved toward the spot indicated. Their
lives had accustomed them to many repulsive and terrible scenes,
but all were visibly shocked by what they saw.</p>

<p>It was a magnificently-formed Blackfoot warrior, lying flat upon
his back, while the bird had been tearing its meal from his vitals.
He had undoubtedly been dead several days, else the odor would
not have penetrated so far, but there was no bullet-mark upon
his person, so far as the three could see without a more minute
examination than any chose to make.</p>

<p>"What killed him?" asked Black Tom.</p>

<p>"The beast," was the instant answer of Teddy.</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?" asked Tom, turning rather sharply
upon the Irishman.</p>

<p>"Look how his hid is broke in," replied Teddy, as he pointed
downward. "Thar ar’ only two things that could break it in that
shtyle."</p>

<p>"Wal, what are they?"</p>

<p>"A shillalegh or the baste; and, as there is no one prisent that
can wield the shillalegh but your humble servant, Teddy O’Doherty,
be the same towken it must have bin the baste."</p>

<p>The trappers acquiesced in the decision of their companion, and
felt certain that the Blackfoot had been a victim to the fury
of the brute that had so terrified them. It was plain that he
had been struck a terrible blow on the head and face, a blow that
had crushed in his skull as though it were an egg-shell.</p>

<p>Here there was a demonstration of what this fearful creature
could do, when excited by anger, and it sent a natural shudder
through the whole three.</p>

<p>"I tell yer," said old Stebbins, in a solemn undertone, "it wouldn’t
take much to turn me back ag’in toward the States."</p>

<p>Black Tom was silent a moment, and then shook his head.</p>

<p>"No; thar’s gold around us, and we’ll stay long ’nough to git
some of it to pay fur comin’ hyar."</p>

<p>"I’d rather have the Blackfeet swarmin’ all around, than that
ar’ single critter."</p>

<p>"So would I; but how you goin’ to help it?"</p>

<p>"Kaap with me," said Teddy. "The baste and mesilf ar’ on the
bist of terms, as me Bridget remarked whin she threw her parlor-sofa
(that she used as a bootjack) at me hid, and by r’ason of me prisence
wid yees, ye’ll be thrated in the same ilegant shtyle."</p>

<p>All this might be true, but there was little probability of it,
and the two trappers were too great veterans in the service to
place any reliance upon it. Indeed they believed it would be fatal
foolhardiness for the Irishman to trust himself in its power again.</p>

<p>But they saw no remedy except to retreat, and they were not yet
prepared for that. So they returned to the brook and resumed their
hunt for the gold.</p>

<p>By this time the afternoon was well nigh passed, and little time
was left for them to continue their work. They had nigh reached
the place where they had discovered the auriferous particles the
preceding spring, and they pressed on until they saw the yellow
ore gleaming under the crystal waters, just as it had gleamed
there for many a long year.</p>

<p>"Here’s some of the stuff any way," said Black Tom, after he
had lifted a lot in his hand and carefully scrutinized it.</p>

<p>"Yes; thar’s no mistake ’bout <em>that</em>," replied old Stebbins.
"We kin begin work right here, and make more in a day, than in
a week by trapping. So, what do yer say? Do we resoom?"</p>

<p>"In the mornin’; we’ll take a sleep on it."</p>

<p>Gathering up their implements, they started on their return.
By the time they were fairly in the cañon again it was fully dark,
and, walled in as they were on either hand by such high, rocky
cliffs, the darkness became so profound that they could scarcely
see a step before them.</p>

<p>But they remembered the route too well to go astray, and they
moved cautiously but unhesitatingly forward in the direction of
the cavern that they had selected for their home, while at work
in this region.</p>

<p>At the upper end of the cañon, indeed before it narrowed enough
really to deserve the name, there was a mass of trees and undergrowth,
through which the three hunters were making their way, when Black
Tom uttered his low, sudden "’sh!" of alarm.</p>

<p>The others paused and listened, and looked around to learn the
cause of this signal of their companion.</p>

<p>Like the faint twinkle of a star low down in the horizon, the
three caught the glimmer of a camp-fire in this mass of vegetation
and undergrowth.</p>

<p>"I knowed thar war others ’bout," said Black Tom, after a moment’s
pause; "whether they’re red or white-skins, we can’t tell till
we find out."</p>

<p>"Let’s do it," said old Stebbins, and simultaneously the three
set out toward the point of light, moving in the stealthy, silent
manner that had become almost a second nature to them; but they
had not gone far when Tom paused and said:</p>

<p>"Go ahead and l’arn what yer can, and I’ll go down to the cavern
and wait for ye. Thar’s no need of all of us goin’ there."</p>

<p>The trapper moved away from them as he spoke, not waiting to
hear their opinions; and, as each party met with a curious adventure
very shortly after, we will proceed to give them in detail.</p>
