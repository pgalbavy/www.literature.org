<p>The day after Christine had vanished before his eyes in a sort
of dazzlement that still made him doubt the evidence of his senses,
M. le Vicomte de Chagny called to inquire at Mamma Valerius'. 
He came upon a charming picture.  Christine herself was seated
by the bedside of the old lady, who was sitting up against the
pillows, knitting.  The pink and white had returned to the young
girl's cheeks.  The dark rings round her eyes had disappeared. 
Raoul no longer recognized the tragic face of the day before. 
If the veil of melancholy over those adorable features had not
still appeared to the young man as the last trace of the weird
drama in whose toils that mysterious child was struggling, he
could have believed that Christine was not its heroine at all.</p>

<p>She rose, without showing any emotion, and offered him her hand. 
But Raoul's stupefaction was so great that he stood there dumfounded,
without a gesture, without a word.</p>

<p>"Well, M. de Chagny," exclaimed Mamma Valerius, "don't you know
our Christine?  Her good genius has sent her back to us!"</p>

<p>"Mamma!" the girl broke in promptly, while a deep blush mantled
to her eyes.  "I thought, mamma, that there was to be no more
question of that! ... You know there is no such thing as the Angel
of Music!"</p>

<p>"But, child, he gave you lessons for three months!"</p>

<p>"Mamma, I have promised to explain everything to you one of these
days; and I hope to do so but you have promised me, until that
day, to be silent and to ask me no more questions whatever!"</p>

<p>"Provided that you promised never to leave me again!  But have
you promised that, Christine?"</p>

<p>"Mamma, all this can not interest M. de Chagny."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, mademoiselle," said the young man, in a voice
which he tried to make firm and brave, but which still trembled,
"anything that concerns you interests me to an extent which perhaps
you will one day understand.  I do not deny that my surprise equals
my pleasure at finding you with your adopted mother and that,
after what happened between us yesterday, after what you said
and what I was able to guess, I hardly expected to see you here
so soon.  I should be the first to delight at your return, if
you were not so bent on preserving a secrecy that may be fatal
to you ... and I have been your friend too long not to be alarmed,
with Mme. Valerius, at a disastrous adventure which will remain
dangerous so long as we have not unraveled its threads and of
which you will certainly end by being the victim, Christine."</p>

<p>At these words, Mamma Valerius tossed about in her bed.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" she cried.  "Is Christine in danger?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame," said Raoul courageously, notwithstanding the signs
which Christine made to him.</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed the good, simple old woman, gasping for breath.
"You must tell me everything, Christine!  Why did you try to reassure
me?  And what danger is it, M. de Chagny?"</p>

<p>"An impostor is abusing her good faith."</p>

<p>"Is the Angel of Music an impostor?"</p>

<p>"She told you herself that there is no Angel of Music."</p>

<p>"But then what is it, in Heaven's name?  You will be the death
of me!"</p>

<p>"There is a terrible mystery around us, madame, around you, around
Christine, a mystery much more to be feared than any number of
ghosts or genii!"</p>

<p>Mamma Valerius turned a terrified face to Christine, who had
already run to her adopted mother and was holding her in her arms.</p>

<p>"Don't believe him, mummy, don't believe him," she repeated.</p>

<p>"Then tell me that you will never leave me again," implored the
widow.</p>

<p>Christine was silent and Raoul resumed.</p>

<p>"That is what you must promise, Christine.  It is the only thing
that can reassure your mother and me.  We will undertake not to
ask you a single question about the past, if you promise us to
remain under our protection in future."</p>

<p>"That is an undertaking which I have not asked of you and a promise
which I refuse to make you!" said the young girl haughtily.  "I
am mistress of my own actions, M. de Chagny: you have no right
to control them, and I will beg you to desist henceforth.  As
to what I have done during the last fortnight, there is only one
man in the world who has the right to demand an account of me:
my husband!  Well, I have no husband and I never mean to marry!"</p>

<p>She threw out her hands to emphasize her words and Raoul turned
pale, not only because of the words which he had heard, but because
he had caught sight of a plain gold ring on Christine's finger.</p>

<p>"You have no husband and yet you wear a wedding-ring."</p>

<p>He tried to seize her hand, but she swiftly drew it back.</p>

<p>"That's a present!" she said, blushing once more and vainly striving
to hide her embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Christine!  As you have no husband, that ring can only have
been given by one who hopes to make you his wife!  Why deceive
us further?  Why torture me still more?  That ring is a promise;
and that promise has been accepted!"</p>

<p>"That's what I said!" exclaimed the old lady.</p>

<p>"And what did she answer, madame?"</p>

<p>"What I chose," said Christine, driven to exasperation.  "Don't
you think, monsieur, that this cross-examination has lasted long
enough? As far as I am concerned ..."</p>

<p>Raoul was afraid to let her finish her speech.  He interrupted
her:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for speaking as I did, mademoiselle.  You
know the good intentions that make me meddle, just now, in matters
which, you no doubt think, have nothing to do with me.  But allow
me to tell you what I have seen&mdash;and I have seen more than you
suspect, Christine&mdash;or what I thought I saw, for, to tell you
the truth, I have sometimes been inclined to doubt the evidence
of my eyes."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you see, sir, or think you saw?"</p>

<p>"I saw your ecstasy AT <em>THE SOUND OF THE VOICE, </em>Christine: 
the voice that came from the wall or the next room to yours ...
yes, <em>YOUR ECSTASY!  </em>And that is what makes me alarmed
on your behalf.  You are under a very dangerous spell.  And yet
it seems that you are aware of the imposture, because you say
to-day <em>THAT THERE IS NO ANGEL OF MUSIC! </em>In that case,
Christine, why did you follow him that time?  Why did you stand
up, with radiant features, as though you were really hearing angels?
... Ah, it is a very dangerous voice, Christine, for I myself,
when I heard it, was so much fascinated by it that you vanished
before my eyes without my seeing which way you passed!  Christine,
Christine, in the name of Heaven, in the name of your father who
is in Heaven now and who loved you so dearly and who loved me
too, Christine, tell us, tell your benefactress and me, to whom
does that voice belong?  If you do, we will save you in spite
of yourself.  Come, Christine, the name of the man!  The name
of the man who had the audacity to put a ring on your finger!"</p>

<p>"M. de Chagny," the girl declared coldly, "you shall never know!"</p>

<p>Thereupon, seeing the hostility with which her ward had addressed
the viscount, Mamma Valerius suddenly took Christine's part.</p>

<p>"And, if she does love that man, Monsieur le Vicomte, even then
it is no business of yours!"</p>

<p>"Alas, madame," Raoul humbly replied, unable to restrain his
tears, "alas, I believe that Christine really does love him! ...
But it is not only that which drives me to despair; for what I
am not certain of, madame, is that the man whom Christine loves
is worthy of her love!"</p>

<p>"It is for me to be the judge of that, monsieur!" said Christine,
looking Raoul angrily in the face.</p>

<p>"When a man," continued Raoul, "adopts such romantic methods
to entice a young girl's affections. .."</p>

<p>"The man must be either a villain, or the girl a fool:  is that
it?"</p>

<p>"Christine!"</p>

<p>"Raoul, why do you condemn a man whom you have never seen, whom
no one knows and about whom you yourself know nothing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Christine ...  Yes ...  I at least know the name that you
thought to keep from me for ever ...  The name of your Angel of
Music, mademoiselle, is Erik!"</p>

<p>Christine at once betrayed herself.  She turned as white as a
sheet and stammered:  "Who told you?"</p>

<p>"You yourself!"</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"By pitying him the other night, the night of the masked ball. 
When you went to your dressing-room, did you not say, 'Poor Erik?'
Well, Christine, there was a poor Raoul who overheard you."</p>

<p>"This is the second time that you have listened behind the door,
M. de Chagny!"</p>

<p>"I was not behind the door ... I was in the dressing-room, in
the inner room, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Oh, unhappy man!" moaned the girl, showing every sign of unspeakable
terror.  "Unhappy man!  Do you want to be killed?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>Raoul uttered this "perhaps" with so much love and despair in
his voice that Christine could not keep back a sob.  She took
his hands and looked at him with all the pure affection of which
she was capable:</p>

<p>"Raoul," she said, "forget <em>THE MAN'S VOICE </em>and do not
even remember its name... You must never try to fathom the mystery
of <em>THE MAN'S VOICE</em>."</p>

<p>"Is the mystery so very terrible?"</p>

<p>"There is no more awful mystery on this earth.  Swear to me that
you will make no attempt to find out," she insisted.  "Swear to
me that you will never come to my dressing-room, unless I send
for you."</p>

<p>"Then you promise to send for me sometimes, Christine?"</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"Then I swear to do as you ask."</p>

<p>He kissed her hands and went away, cursing Erik and resolving
to be patient.</p>
