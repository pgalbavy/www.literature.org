<p>Captures Made After the Signing of the Treaty of Peace &mdash;The
Privateers&mdash;Exploit of the <em>General Armstrong</em> &mdash;Its
Far-Reaching Result.</p>

<p>The treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States
was signed December 24, 1814, at the city of Ghent, in Belgium.
Had the submarine telegraph been known at that time, or had we
possessed our ocean greyhounds, a good deal of blood-shed would
have been saved, and the most important victory of the whole war
would not have been gained. General Jackson won his famous triumph
at New Orleans&mdash;still celebrated in all parts of the country &mdash;January
8, 1815; the <em>President</em> was captured by a British fleet,
January 15; Captain Stewart captured the <em>Cyane</em> and <em>Levant</em>,
February 20; the <em>Hornet</em> took the <em>Penguin</em>, March
23, and the <em>Peacock</em> captured the <em>Nautilus</em>, in
a distant part of the world, June 30. That was the last of hostilities
between the two countries, and let us pray that it will be the
last for all time to come.</p>

<p>In the account of the naval exploits of the War of 1812, I have
confined myself to those of the regular cruisers of the United
States, but in no other war in which we were engaged did the privateers
play so prominent a part. These vessels were usually schooners
or brigs of 200 or 300 tons, with crews varying from 75 to 100
men. They left all of our principal ports, many of the swiftest
and most effective going from Baltimore, but twenty-six were fitted
out in New York alone in the summer of 1812. Probably the whole
number engaged was about six hundred. Of the four hundred British
prizes captured in the second year of the war, four-fifths were
taken by privateers. A favorite cruising ground was the West Indies,
but some of the vessels ventured across the ocean and displayed
a degree of boldness that recalled the days of Paul Jones. Among
the most famous were the <em>Reindeer</em>, <em>Avon</em> and
<em>Blakeley</em>, built in a few weeks, near Boston, in 1814.
They were so large and well equipped that more than once they
attacked and defeated British warships.</p>

<p>Some of the privateers which left Charleston, Bristol and Plymouth
were nothing but pilot boats, carrying twenty or thirty men each,
who gave their attention to the West Indies. They were often obliged
to deplete their crews to that extent in order to man their prizes
that barely enough were left to manage their own ships. In those
days all, of course, were sailing vessels, and they carried nothing
in the shape of armor. Their guns were cannon, loading at the
muzzle and firing solid shot. The most effective of these was
the "Long Tom," which was generally mounted on a pivot forward,
and used in firing upon a fleeing vessel.</p>

<p>(<em>Afterward President of the United States</em>.)</p>

<p>The most famous achievement was that of the privateer <em>General
Armstrong</em>, which carried nine long guns, the largest being
24-pounders, or "long nines." She sailed with a large crew, which
was depleted to ninety on account of the number in charge of the
prizes captured. Her commander was Captain Samuel C. Reid, born
in Connecticut in 1783, and died in 1861. It was he who designed
the accepted pattern of the United States flag, with its thirteen
stripes and one star for each State. The fifteen-striped flag,
which it has been stated was carried through the War of 1812,
remained the pattern until 1818, when the change referred to was
made.</p>

<p>While engaged upon one of his successful cruises, Captain Reid
put into the harbor of Fayal, one of the Azores, to provision
his ship. He was thus employed when Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane,
of England, reached the same port and on the same errand. He had
with him three vessels: the flagship <em>Plantagenet</em>, 74
guns; the frigate <em>Rotan</em>, 38 guns, and the brig <em>Carnation</em>,
18 guns. This powerful squadron was manned by 2,000 men, and was
on the way to New Orleans with the purpose of occupying the city.</p>

<p>When the British admiral discovered the American privateer within
the harbor, he placed his own vessels so as to prevent its escape.
Captain Reid did not think the enemy would attack him, since the
harbor was neutral, but the previous experience of his countrymen
warned him that it was not safe to count upon the British respecting
the laws of war when there was an opportunity to destroy one of
the pests of the ocean. He cleared his decks and made every preparation
against attack, and it was well he did so.</p>

<p>It was not long before he observed several boats, crowded with
men, leave the <em>Plantagenet</em> and row toward him. This was
on the 26th of September. There being no doubt of their hostile
purpose, Captain Reid several times warned them off, but they
paid no attention to him. He then fired upon the boats, and a
number of the crews were killed and wounded. This was a sort of
reception they had not counted upon, and the boats turned about
and hastily rowed back to the flagship.</p>

<p>"We have got to fight," said Captain Reid to his men; "they will
attack us again to-night, and things will be lively."</p>

<p>There was no thought of surrender on the part of the Americans,
though, as will be noted, they were threatened by a force more
than twenty times as numerous as their own. They sent their valuables
ashore and disposed of everything, as if not a man expected to
emerge from the fight alive. All were cool and confident, and
the dauntless courage of the commander inspired every one around
him.</p>

<p>Night settled over the harbor, and by and by the sounds of oars
showed the enemy were approaching again. Through the gloom seven
boats, containing two hundred men, loomed into view, coming straight
for the <em>General Armstrong</em>. Each carried a carronade,
with which they opened fire on the privateer. The reply of the
latter was so well directed and effective that three of the boats
were sunk and their crews left struggling in the water. The cries
that sounded across the harbor left no doubt of the effect of
the fire of the American.</p>

<p>The four remaining boats were not frightened off, but, rowing
with might and main, reached the side of the vessel and began
clambering on board. They were enraged, and as their heads rose
above the gunwales they shouted, "No quarter!"</p>

<p>"No quarter!" replied the Americans, discharging their pistols
in their faces and pressing them back into the water with their
pikes. The assailants displayed great bravery and made desperate
efforts to board the privateer; but the Americans needed not the
incentive of the warning that no quarter would be given to fight
with all the vigor and skill at their command. The struggle was
a furious one, but in the end the British were so decisively defeated
that only two of the boats returned to the ships. The others,
filled with dead and wounded, drifted ashore.</p>

<p>(<em>Our Last Naval Engagement with England</em>.)</p>

<p>In this brief but terrific struggle there were only two Americans
killed and seven wounded, while the enemy acknowledged a loss
of thirty-four killed and eighty-six wounded, the former including
the leader of the expedition.</p>

<p>Admiral Cochrane was so incensed by the rough treatment his men
had received that he determined to throw neutrality to the winds
and destroy the defiant privateer. Nothing more was attempted
that evening, but in the morning the <em>Carnation</em> advanced
to the attack of the <em>General Armstrong</em>. This gave the
latter a chance to bring its Long Tom into play, and it was served
with such unerring accuracy that not a shot missed. Before the
brig could come to close quarters she was so crippled that she
was obliged to withdraw.</p>

<p>The three ships now closed in. It would have been folly to fight
them. So Captain Reid scuttled his ship, lowered his boats and
rowed ashore. The enemy were disposed to follow him thither, but
he and his men took refuge in an old stone fortress and dared
the Englishmen to do so. Upon second thought they decided to leave
the Americans to themselves.</p>

<p>This wonderful exploit was celebrated in song, one stanza of
which ended thus:</p>

<p>"From set of sun till rise of morn, through the long September
night, Ninety men against two thousand, and the ninety won the
fight;</p>

<p>
In the harbor of Fayal the Azore."

<p>While the victory of itself was one of the most remarkable of
which there is any record, it resembled that of Perry on Lake
Erie in its far-reaching consequences. Admiral Cochrane found
his ships so crippled that he returned to England to refit. He
then sailed for New Orleans, which he reached a few days after
it had been occupied by General Jackson. But for the delay caused
by his fight with Captain Reid he would have shut out General
Jackson from the city and prevented his winning the most glorious
land victory of the whole war.</p>
