<P>
Big Alec had never been captured by the fish patrol.  It was his
boast that no man could take him alive, and it was his history that
of the many men who had tried to take him dead none had succeeded.
It was also history that at least two patrolmen who had tried to
take him dead had died themselves.  Further, no man violated the
fish laws more systematically and deliberately than Big Alec.
<P>
He was called "Big Alec" because of his gigantic stature.  His
height was six feet three inches, and he was correspondingly broad-
shouldered and deep-chested.  He was splendidly muscled and hard as
steel, and there were innumerable stories in circulation among the
fisher-folk concerning his prodigious strength.  He was as bold and
dominant of spirit as he was strong of body, and because of this he
was widely known by another name, that of "The King of the Greeks."
The fishing population was largely composed of Greeks, and they
looked up to him and obeyed him as their chief.  And as their
chief, he fought their fights for them, saw that they were
protected, saved them from the law when they fell into its
clutches, and made them stand by one another and himself in time of
trouble.
<P>
In the old days, the fish patrol had attempted his capture many
disastrous times and had finally given it over, so that when the
word was out that he was coming to Benicia, I was most anxious to
see him.  But I did not have to hunt him up.  In his usual bold
way, the first thing he did on arriving was to hunt us up.  Charley
Le Grant and I at the time were under a patrol-man named Carmintel,
and the three of us were on the Reindeer, preparing for a trip,
when Big Alec stepped aboard.  Carmintel evidently knew him, for
they shook hands in recognition.  Big Alec took no notice of
Charley or me.
<P>
"I've come down to fish sturgeon a couple of months," he said to
Carmintel.
<P>
His eyes flashed with challenge as he spoke, and we noticed the
patrolman's eyes drop before him.
<P>
"That's all right, Alec," Carmintel said in a low voice.  "I'll not
bother you.  Come on into the cabin, and we'll talk things over,"
he added.
<P>
When they had gone inside and shut the doors after them, Charley
winked with slow deliberation at me.  But I was only a youngster,
and new to men and the ways of some men, so I did not understand.
Nor did Charley explain, though I felt there was something wrong
about the business.
<P>
Leaving them to their conference, at Charley's suggestion we
boarded our skiff and pulled over to the Old Steamboat Wharf, where
Big Alec's ark was lying.  An ark is a house-boat of small though
comfortable dimensions, and is as necessary to the Upper Bay
fisherman as are nets and boats.  We were both curious to see Big
Alec's ark, for history said that it had been the scene of more
than one pitched battle, and that it was riddled with bullet-holes.
<P>
We found the holes (stopped with wooden plugs and painted over),
but there were not so many as I had expected.  Charley noted my
look of disappointment, and laughed; and then to comfort me he gave
an authentic account of one expedition which had descended upon Big
Alec's floating home to capture him, alive preferably, dead if
necessary.  At the end of half a day's fighting, the patrolmen had
drawn off in wrecked boats, with one of their number killed and
three wounded.  And when they returned next morning with
reinforcements they found only the mooring-stakes of Big Alec's
ark; the ark itself remained hidden for months in the fastnesses of
the Suisun tules.
<P>
"But why was he not hanged for murder?" I demanded.  "Surely the
United States is powerful enough to bring such a man to justice."
<P>
"He gave himself up and stood trial," Charley answered.  "It cost
him fifty thousand dollars to win the case, which he did on
technicalities and with the aid of the best lawyers in the state.
Every Greek fisherman on the river contributed to the sum.  Big
Alec levied and collected the tax, for all the world like a king.
The United States may be all-powerful, my lad, but the fact remains
that Big Alec is a king inside the United States, with a country
and subjects all his own."
<P>
"But what are you going to do about his fishing for sturgeon?  He's
bound to fish with a 'Chinese line.'"
<P>
Charley shrugged his shoulders.  "We'll see what we will see," he
said enigmatically.
<P>
Now a "Chinese line" is a cunning device invented by the people
whose name it bears.  By a simple system of floats, weights, and
anchors, thousands of hooks, each on a separate leader, are
suspended at a distance of from six inches to a foot above the
bottom.  The remarkable thing about such a line is the hook.  It is
barbless, and in place of the barb, the hook is filed long and
tapering to a point as sharp as that of a needle.  These hoods are
only a few inches apart, and when several thousand of them are
suspended just above the bottom, like a fringe, for a couple of
hundred fathoms, they present a formidable obstacle to the fish
that travel along the bottom.
<P>
Such a fish is the sturgeon, which goes rooting along like a pig,
and indeed is often called "pig-fish."  Pricked by the first hook
it touches, the sturgeon gives a startled leap and comes into
contact with half a dozen more hooks.  Then it threshes about
wildly, until it receives hook after hook in its soft flesh; and
the hooks, straining from many different angles, hold the luckless
fish fast until it is drowned.  Because no sturgeon can pass
through a Chinese line, the device is called a trap in the fish
laws; and because it bids fair to exterminate the sturgeon, it is
branded by the fish laws as illegal.  And such a line, we were
confident, Big Alec intended setting, in open and flagrant
violation of the law.
<P>
Several days passed after the visit of Big Alec, during which
Charley and I kept a sharp watch on him.  He towed his ark around
the Solano Wharf and into the big bight at Turner's Shipyard.  The
bight we knew to be good ground for sturgeon, and there we felt
sure the King of the Greeks intended to begin operations.  The tide
circled like a mill-race in and out of this bight, and made it
possible to raise, lower, or set a Chinese line only at slack
water.  So between the tides Charley and I made it a point for one
or the other of us to keep a lookout from the Solano Wharf.
<P>
On the fourth day I was lying in the sun behind the stringer-piece
of the wharf, when I saw a skiff leave the distant shore and pull
out into the bight.  In an instant the glasses were at my eyes and
I was following every movement of the skiff.  There were two men in
it, and though it was a good mile away, I made out one of them to
be Big Alec; and ere the skiff returned to shore I made out enough
more to know that the Greek had set his line.
<P>
"Big Alec has a Chinese line out in the bight off Turner's
Shipyard," Charley Le Grant said that afternoon to Carmintel.
<P>
A fleeting expression of annoyance passed over the patrolman's
face, and then he said, "Yes?" in an absent way, and that was all.
<P>
Charley bit his lip with suppressed anger and turned on his heel.
<P>
"Are you game, my lad?" he said to me later on in the evening, just
as we finished washing down the Reindeer's decks and were preparing
to turn in.
<P>
A lump came up in my throat, and I could only nod my head.
<P>
"Well, then," and Charley's eyes glittered in a determined way,
"we've got to capture Big Alec between us, you and I, and we've got
to do it in spite of Carmintel.  Will you lend a hand?"
<P>
"It's a hard proposition, but we can do it," he added after a
pause.
<P>
"Of course we can," I supplemented enthusiastically.
<P>
And then he said, "Of course we can," and we shook hands on it and
went to bed.
<P>
But it was no easy task we had set ourselves.  In order to convict
a man of illegal fishing, it was necessary to catch him in the act
with all the evidence of the crime about him - the hooks, the
lines, the fish, and the man himself.  This meant that we must take
Big Alec on the open water, where he could see us coming and
prepare for us one of the warm receptions for which he was noted.
<P>
"There's no getting around it," Charley said one morning.  "If we
can only get alongside it's an even toss, and there's nothing left
for us but to try and get alongside.  Come on, lad."
<P>
We were in the Columbia River salmon boat, the one we had used
against the Chinese shrimp-catchers.  Slack water had come, and as
we dropped around the end of the Solano Wharf we saw Big Alec at
work, running his line and removing the fish.
<P>
"Change places," Charley commanded, "and steer just astern of him
as though you're going into the shipyard."
<P>
I took the tiller, and Charley sat down on a thwart amidships,
placing his revolver handily beside him.
<P>
"If he begins to shoot," he cautioned, "get down in the bottom and
steer from there, so that nothing more than your hand will be
exposed."
<P>
I nodded, and we kept silent after that, the boat slipping gently
through the water and Big Alec growing nearer and nearer.  We could
see him quite plainly, gaffing the sturgeon and throwing them into
the boat while his companion ran the line and cleared the hooks as
he dropped them back into the water.  Nevertheless, we were five
hundred yards away when the big fisherman hailed us.
<P>
"Here!  You!  What do you want?" he shouted.
<P>
"Keep going," Charley whispered, "just as though you didn't hear
him."
<P>
The next few moments were very anxious ones.  The fisherman was
studying us sharply, while we were gliding up on him every second.
<P>
"You keep off if you know what's good for you!" he called out
suddenly, as though he had made up his mind as to who and what we
were.  "If you don't, I'll fix you!"
<P>
He brought a rifle to his shoulder and trained it on me.
<P>
"Now will you keep off?" he demanded.
<P>
I could hear Charley groan with disappointment.  "Keep off," he
whispered; "it's all up for this time."
<P>
I put up the tiller and eased the sheet, and the salmon boat ran
off five or six points.  Big Alec watched us till we were out of
range, when he returned to his work.
<P>
"You'd better leave Big Alec alone," Carmintel said, rather sourly,
to Charley that night.
<P>
"So he's been complaining to you, has he?"  Charley said
significantly.
<P>
Carmintel flushed painfully.  "You'd better leave him alone, I tell
you," he repeated.  "He's a dangerous man, and it won't pay to fool
with him."
<P>
"Yes," Charley answered softly; "I've heard that it pays better to
leave him alone."
<P>
This was a direct thrust at Carmintel, and we could see by the
expression of his face that it sank home.  For it was common
knowledge that Big Alec was as willing to bribe as to fight, and
that of late years more than one patrolman had handled the
fisherman's money.
<P>
"Do you mean to say - " Carmintel began, in a bullying tone.
<P>
But Charley cut him off shortly.  "I mean to say nothing," he said.
"You heard what I said, and if the cap fits, why - "
<P>
He shrugged his shoulders, and Carmintel glowered at him,
speechless.
<P>
"What we want is imagination," Charley said to me one day, when we
had attempted to creep upon Big Alec in the gray of dawn and had
been shot at for our trouble.
<P>
And thereafter, and for many days, I cudgelled my brains trying to
imagine some possible way by which two men, on an open stretch of
water, could capture another who knew how to use a rifle and was
never to be found without one.  Regularly, every slack water,
without slyness, boldly and openly in the broad day, Big Alec was
to be seen running his line.  And what made it particularly
exasperating was the fact that every fisherman, from Benicia to
Vallejo knew that he was successfully defying us.  Carmintel also
bothered us, for he kept us busy among the shad-fishers of San
Pablo, so that we had little time to spare on the King of the
Greeks.  But Charley's wife and children lived at Benicia, and we
had made the place our headquarters, so that we always returned to
it.
<P>
"I'll tell you what we can do," I said, after several fruitless
weeks had passed; "we can wait some slack water till Big Alec has
run his line and gone ashore with the fish, and then we can go out
and capture the line.  It will put him to time and expense to make
another, and then we'll figure to capture that too.  If we can't
capture him, we can discourage him, you see."
<P>
Charley saw, and said it wasn't a bad idea.  We watched our chance,
and the next low-water slack, after Big Alec had removed the fish
from the line and returned ashore, we went out in the salmon boat.
We had the bearings of the line from shore marks, and we knew we
would have no difficulty in locating it.  The first of the flood
tide was setting in, when we ran below where we thought the line
was stretched and dropped over a fishing-boat anchor.  Keeping a
short rope to the anchor, so that it barely touched the bottom, we
dragged it slowly along until it stuck and the boat fetched up hard
and fast.
<P>
"We've got it," Charley cried.  "Come on and lend a hand to get it
in."
<P>
Together we hove up the rope till the anchor I came in sight with
the sturgeon line caught across one of the flukes.  Scores of the
murderous-looking hooks flashed into sight as we cleared the
anchor, and we had just started to run along the line to the end
where we could begin to lift it, when a sharp thud in the boat
startled us.  We looked about, but saw nothing and returned to our
work.  An instant later there was a similar sharp thud and the
gunwale splintered between Charley's body and mine.
<P>
"That's remarkably like a bullet, lad," he said reflectively.  "And
it's a long shot Big Alec's making."
<P>
"And he's using smokeless powder," he concluded, after an
examination of the mile-distant shore.  "That's why we can't hear
the report."
<P>
I looked at the shore, but could see no sign of Big Alec, who was
undoubtedly hidden in some rocky nook with us at his mercy.  A
third bullet struck the water, glanced, passed singing over our
heads, and struck the water again beyond.
<P>
"I guess we'd better get out of this," Charley remarked coolly.
"What do you think, lad?"
<P>
I thought so, too, and said we didn't want the line anyway.
Whereupon we cast off and hoisted the spritsail.  The bullets
ceased at once, and we sailed away, unpleasantly confident that Big
Alec was laughing at our discomfiture.
<P>
And more than that, the next day on the fishing wharf, where we
were inspecting nets, he saw fit to laugh and sneer at us, and this
before all the fishermen.  Charley's face went black with anger;
but beyond promising Big Alec that in the end he would surely land
him behind the bars, he controlled himself and said nothing.  The
King of the Greeks made his boast that no fish patrol had ever
taken him or ever could take him, and the fishermen cheered him and
said it was true.  They grew excited, and it looked like trouble
for a while; but Big Alec asserted his kingship and quelled them.
<P>
Carmintel also laughed at Charley, and dropped sarcastic remarks,
and made it hard for him.  But Charley refused to be angered,
though he told me in confidence that he intended to capture Big
Alec if it took all the rest of his life to accomplish it.
<P>
"I don't know how I'll do it," he said, "but do it I will, as sure
as I am Charley Le Grant.  The idea will come to me at the right
and proper time, never fear."
<P>
And at the right time it came, and most unexpectedly.  Fully a
month had passed, and we were constantly up and down the river, and
down and up the bay, with no spare moments to devote to the
particular fisherman who ran a Chinese line in the bight of
Turner's Shipyard.  We had called in at Selby's Smelter one
afternoon, while on patrol work, when all unknown to us our
opportunity happened along.  It appeared in the guise of a helpless
yacht loaded with seasick people, so we could hardly be expected to
recognize it as the opportunity.  It was a large sloop-yacht, and
it was helpless inasmuch as the trade-wind was blowing half a gale
and there were no capable sailors aboard.
<P>
From the wharf at Selby's we watched with careless interest the
lubberly manoeuvre performed of bringing the yacht to anchor, and
the equally lubberly manoeuvre of sending the small boat ashore.  A
very miserable-looking man in draggled ducks, after nearly swamping
the boat in the heavy seas, passed us the painter and climbed out.
He staggered about as though the wharf were rolling, and told us
his troubles, which were the troubles of the yacht.  The only
rough-weather sailor aboard, the man on whom they all depended, had
been called back to San Francisco by a telegram, and they had
attempted to continue the cruise alone.  The high wind and big seas
of San Pablo Bay had been too much for them; all hands were sick,
nobody knew anything or could do anything; and so they had run in
to the smelter either to desert the yacht or to get somebody to
bring it to Benicia.  In short, did we know of any sailors who
would bring the yacht into Benicia?
<P>
Charley looked at me.  The Reindeer was lying in a snug place.  We
had nothing on hand in the way of patrol work till midnight.  With
the wind then blowing, we could sail the yacht into Benicia in a
couple of hours, have several more hours ashore, and come back to
the smelter on the evening train.
<P>
"All right, captain," Charley said to the disconsolate yachtsman,
who smiled in sickly fashion at the title.
<P>
"I'm only the owner," he explained.
<P>
We rowed him aboard in much better style than he had come ashore,
and saw for ourselves the helplessness of the passengers.  There
were a dozen men and women, and all of them too sick even to appear
grateful at our coming.  The yacht was rolling savagely, broad on,
and no sooner had the owner's feet touched the deck than he
collapsed and joined, the others.  Not one was able to bear a hand,
so Charley and I between us cleared the badly tangled running gear,
got up sail, and hoisted anchor.
<P>
It was a rough trip, though a swift one.  The Carquinez Straits
were a welter of foam and smother, and we came through them wildly
before the wind, the big mainsail alternately dipping and flinging
its boom skyward as we tore along.  But the people did not mind.
They did not mind anything.  Two or three, including the owner,
sprawled in the cockpit, shuddering when the yacht lifted and raced
and sank dizzily into the trough, and between-whiles regarding the
shore with yearning eyes.  The rest were huddled on the cabin floor
among the cushions.  Now and again some one groaned, but for the
most part they were as limp as so many dead persons.
<P>
As the bight at Turner's Shipyard opened out, Charley edged into it
to get the smoother water.  Benicia was in view, and we were
bowling along over comparatively easy water, when a speck of a boat
danced up ahead of us, directly in our course.  It was low-water
slack.  Charley and I looked at each other.  No word was spoken,
but at once the yacht began a most astonishing performance, veering
and yawing as though the greenest of amateurs was at the wheel.  It
was a sight for sailormen to see.  To all appearances, a runaway
yacht was careering madly over the bight, and now and again
yielding a little bit to control in a desperate effort to make
Benicia.
<P>
The owner forgot his seasickness long enough to look anxious.  The
speck of a boat grew larger and larger, till we could see Big Alec
and his partner, with a turn of the sturgeon line around a cleat,
resting from their labor to laugh at us.  Charley pulled his
sou'wester over his eyes, and I followed his example, though I
could not guess the idea he evidently had in mind and intended to
carry into execution.
<P>
We came foaming down abreast of the skiff, so close that we could
hear above the wind the voices of Big Alec and his mate as they
shouted at us with all the scorn that professional watermen feel
for amateurs, especially when amateurs are making fools of
themselves.
<P>
We thundered on past the fishermen, and nothing had happened.
Charley grinned at the disappointment he saw in my face, and then
shouted:
<P>
"Stand by the main-sheet to jibe!"
<P>
He put the wheel hard over, and the yacht whirled around
obediently.  The main-sheet slacked and dipped, then shot over our
heads after the boom and tautened with a crash on the traveller.
The yacht heeled over almost on her beam ends, and a great wail
went up from the seasick passengers as they swept across the cabin
floor in a tangled mass and piled into a heap in the starboard
bunks.
<P>
But we had no time for them.  The yacht, completing the manoeuvre,
headed into the wind with slatting canvas, and righted to an even
keel.  We were still plunging ahead, and directly in our path was
the skiff.  I saw Big Alec dive overboard and his mate leap for our
bowsprit.  Then came the crash as we struck the boat, and a series
of grinding bumps as it passed under our bottom.
<P>
"That fixes his rifle," I heard Charley mutter, as he sprang upon
the deck to look for Big Alec somewhere astern.
<P>
The wind and sea quickly stopped our forward movement, and we began
to drift backward over the spot where the skiff had been.  Big
Alec's black head and swarthy face popped up within arm's reach;
and all unsuspecting and very angry with what he took to be the
clumsiness of amateur sailors, he was hauled aboard.  Also he was
out of breath, for he had dived deep and stayed down long to escape
our keel.
<P>
The next instant, to the perplexity and consternation of the owner,
Charley was on top of Big Alec in the cockpit, and I was helping
bind him with gaskets.  The owner was dancing excitedly about and
demanding an explanation, but by that time Big Alec's partner had
crawled aft from the bowsprit and was peering apprehensively over
the rail into the cockpit.  Charley's arm shot around his neck and
the man landed on his back beside Big Alec.
<P>
"More gaskets!" Charley shouted, and I made haste to supply them.
<P>
The wrecked skiff was rolling sluggishly a short distance to
windward, and I trimmed the sheets while Charley took the wheel and
steered for it.
<P>
"These two men are old offenders," he explained to the angry owner;
"and they are most persistent violators of the fish and game laws.
You have seen them caught in the act, and you may expect to be
subpoenaed as witness for the state when the trial comes off."
<P>
As he spoke he rounded alongside the skiff.  It had been torn from
the line, a section of which was dragging to it.  He hauled in
forty or fifty feet with a young sturgeon still fast in a tangle of
barbless hooks, slashed that much of the line free with his knife,
and tossed it into the cockpit beside the prisoners.
<P>
"And there's the evidence, Exhibit A, for the people," Charley
continued.  "Look it over carefully so that you may identify it in
the court-room with the time and place of capture."
<P>
And then, in triumph, with no more veering and yawing, we sailed
into Benicia, the King of the Greeks bound hard and fast in the
cockpit, and for the first time in his life a prisoner of the fish
patrol.
