<p>And now I am goin' to relate the very singulerist thing that ever
happened in Jonesville, or the world - although it is eppisodin' to tell
on it now, and also a-gettin' ahead of my story, and hitchin', as you
may say, my cart in front of my horse. But it has got to be told and I
don't know but I may as well tell it now as any time.</p>

<p>Mebby you won't believe it. I don't know as I should myself, if it wuz
told to me, that is, if it come through two or three. But any way it is
the livin' truth.</p>

<p>That very night as Submit Tewksbury sat alone at her supper table,
a-lookin' at that vacent spot on the table-cloth opposite to her, where
the plate laid for Samuel Danher had set for over twenty years, she
heard a knock at the door, and she got up hasty and wiped away her tears
and opened the door. A man stood there in the cold a-lookin' into the
warm cosy little room. He didn't say nothin', he acted strange. He gin
Submit a look that pierced clear to her heart (so they say). A look
that had in it the crystallized love and longin' of twenty years of
faithfulness and heart hunger and homesickness. It wuz a strange look.</p>

<p>Submit's heart begun to flutter, and her face grew red and then white,
and she sez in a little fine tremblin' voice,</p>

<p>&quot;Who be you?&quot;</p>

<p>And he sez,</p>

<p>&quot;I am Samuel Danker.&quot;</p>

<p>And then they say she fainted dead away, and fell over the rockin'
chair, he not bein' near enough to ketch her.</p>

<p>And he brung her to on a burnt feather that fell out of the chair
cushion when she fell. There wuz a small hole in it, so they say, and
the feather oozed out.</p>

<p>I don't tell this for truth, I only say that <span style="text-decoration: underline">they say</span> thus and so.</p>

<p>[Illustration: &quot;I AM SAMUEL DANKER.&quot;]</p>

<p>But as to Samuel's return, that I can swear to, and so can Josiah. And
that they wuz married that  very night of his return, that too can be
swore to. A old minister who lived next door to Submit - superanuated,
but life enough in him to marry 'em safe and sound, a-performin' the
ceremony.</p>

<p>It made a great stir in Jonesville, almost enormus.</p>

<p>But they wuz married safe enough, and happy as two gambolin' lambs, so
they say. Any way Submit looks ten years younger than she did, and I
don't know but more. I don't know but she looks eleven or twelve years
younger, and Samuel, why they say it is a perfect sight to see how happy
he looks, and how he has renewed his age.</p>

<p>The hull affair wuz very pleasin' to the Jonesvillians. Why there wuzn't
more'n one or two villians but what wuz fairly delighted by it, and they
wuz spozed to be envius.</p>

<p>And I drew severel morals from it, and drew 'em quite a good ways too,
over both religous and seckuler grounds.</p>

<p>One of the seekuler ones wuz drawed from her not settin' the table for
him that night, for the first time for twenty years, givin' away the
plate, and settin' on (with tears) only a stun chiny one for herself.
How true it is that if a female woman keeps dressed up slick, piles of
extra good cookin' on hand, and her house oncommon clean, and she sets
down in a rockin' chair, lookin' down the road for company.</p>

<p>[Illustration: &quot;THEY DON'T COME!&quot;] <span style="text-decoration: underline">They don't come!</span></p>

<p>But let her on a cold mornin' leave her dishes onwashed, and her floors
onswept, and put on her husband's old coat over her meanest dress, and
go out (at his urgent request) to help him pick up apples before the
frost spiles 'em. She a-layin' out to cook up some vittles to put on to
her empty shelves when she goes into the house, she not a-dreamin' of
company at that time of day.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">They come!</span></p>

<p>Another moral and a more religeus one. When folks set alone sheddin'
tears on their empty hands, that seem to 'em to be emptied of all
hope and happiness forever. Like es not some Divine Compensation is
a-standin' right on the door steps, ready to enter in and dwell with
'em.</p>

<p>Also that when Submit Tewksbury thought she had gin away for conscience'
sake, her dearest treasure, she had a dearer one gin to her - Samuel
Danker by name.</p>

<p>[Illustration: &quot;THEY COME.&quot;]</p>

<p>Also I drew other ones of various sizes, needless to recapitulate, for
time is hastenin', and I have eppisoded too fur, and to resoom, and take
up agin on my finger the thread of my discourse, that  I dropped in the
Methodist meetin' house at Jonesville, in front of the treasurer.</p>

<p>Wall, Submit brought the plate.</p>

<p>Sister Nash brought twenty-three cents all in pennys, tied up in the
corner of a old handkercif. She is dretful poor, but she had picked up
these here and there doin' little jobs for folks.</p>

<p>And we hadn't hardly the heart to take 'em, nor the heart to refuse
takin' 'em, she wuz so set on givin' 'em. And it wuz jest so with Mahala
Crane, Joe Cranes'es widder.</p>

<p>She, too, is poor, but a Christian, if there ever wuz one. She had made
five pair of overhawls for the clothin' store in Loontown, for which she
had received the princely revenue of fifty cents.</p>

<p>She handed the money over to the treasurer, and we wuz all on us
extremely worked upon and wrought up to see her do it, for she did it
with such a cheerful air. And her poor old calico dress she had on wuz
so thin and wore out, and her dingy alpaca shawl wuz thin to mendin',
and all darned in spots. We all felt that Mahala had ort to took the
money to get her a new dress.</p>

<p>[Illustration: &quot;SISTER ARVILLY LANFRAR, CANVASSIN' FOR A BOOK.&quot;]</p>

<p>But we dasted none on us to say so to her. I  wouldn't have been the one to
tell her that for a dollar bill, she seemed to be so happy a-givin' her
part towerds the fair, and for the good of the meetin' house she loved.</p>

<p>Wall, Sister Meachim had earned two dollars above her wages - she is a
millinner by perswasion, and works at a millinner's shop in Jonesville.
She had earned the two dollars by stayin' and workin' nights after the
day's work wuz done.</p>

<p>And Sister Arvilly Lanfear had earned three dollars and twenty-eight
cents by canvassin' for a book. The name of the book wuz: &quot;The Wild,
Wicked, and Warlike Deeds of Man.&quot;</p>

<p>And Arvilly said she had took solid comfort a-sellin' it, though she
had to wade through snow and slush half way up to her knees some of the
time, a-trailin' round from house to house a-takin' orders fer it. She
said she loved to sell a book that wuz full of truth from the front page
to the back bindin'.</p>

<p>As for me I wouldn't gin a cent for the book, and I remember we had
some words when she come to our house with it. I told her plain that I
wouldn't buy no book that belittled my companion, or tried to - sez I,
&quot;Arvilly, men are <span style="text-decoration: underline">jest</span> as good as wimmen and no better, not a mite
better.&quot;</p>

<p>And Arvilly didn't like it, but I made it up to her in other ways. I
gin her some lamb's wool yarn for a pair of stockin's most immegictly
afterwerds, and a half bushel of but'nuts. She is dretful fond of
but'nuts.</p>

<p>[Illustration: &quot;OLD MISS BALCH.&quot;]</p>

<p>Wall, Sister Shelmadine had sold ten pounds of maple sugar, and brought
the worth on it.</p>

<p>And Sister Henzy brung four dollars and a half, her husband had gin her
for another purpose, but she took it for this, and thought there wuzn't
no harm in it, as she laid out to go without the four dollars and a
halt's worth. It was fine shoes he had gin the money for, and she
calculated to make the old ones do.</p>

<p>And Sister Henzy's mother, old Miss Balch, she is eighty-three years
old, and has inflamatery rheumatiz in her hands, which makes 'em all
swelled up and painful. But Sister Henzy said her mother had knit three
pairs of fringed mittens (the hardest work for her hands she could have
laid holt of, and which must have hurt her fearful). But Miss Henzy said
a neighbor had offered her five dollars fer the three pairs, and so she
felt it wuz her duty to knit 'em, to help the fair along. She is a very
strong Methodist, and loved to forwerd the interests of Zion.</p>

<p>She wuz goin' to give every cent of the money to the meetin' house, so
Sister Henzy said, all but ten cents, that she <span style="text-decoration: underline">had</span> to have to get
Pond's Extract with, to bathe her hands. They wuz in a fearful state. We
all felt bad for old Miss Balch, and I don't believe there wuz a woman
there but what gin her some different receipt fer helpin' her hands,
besides sympathy, lots and lots of it, and pity.</p>

<p>Wall, Sister Sypher'ses husband is clost, very clost with her. She don't
have anythin' to give, only her labor, as well off as they be. And now
he wuz so wrapped up in that buzz saw mill business that she wouldn't
have dasted to approach him any way, that is, to ask him for a cent.</p>

<p>Wall, what should that good little creeter do but gin all the money she
had earned and saved durin' the past year or two, and had laid by for
emergincies or bunnets.</p>

<p>She had got over two dollars and seventy-five cents, which she handed
right over to the treasurer of the fair to get materials for fancy work.
When they wuz got she proposed to knit three pairs of men's socks out
of zephyr woosted, and she said she was goin' to try to pick enough
strawberrys to buy a pair of the socks for Deacon Sypher. She said it
would be a comfort for her to do it, for they would be so soft for the
Deacon's feet.</p>

<p>Wall, Sister Gowdy wuz the last one to gin in dress gin to her by her
uncle out to the Ohio. It wuz gin her to mourn for her mother-in-law in.</p>

<p>And what should that good, willin' creeter do but bring that dress and
gin it to the fair to sell.</p>

<p>We hated to take it, we hated to like dogs, for we knew Sister Gowdy
needed it.</p>

<p>But she would make us take it; she said &quot;if her Mother Gowdy wuz alive,
she would say to her,</p>

<p>&quot;Sarah Ann, I'd ruther not be mourned for in bombazeen than to have the
dear old meetin' house in Jonesville go to destruction. Sell the dress
and mourn fer me in a black calico.&quot;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">That</span> Sister Gowdy said would be, she knew, what Mother Gowdy would say
to her if she wuz alive.</p>

<p>And we couldn't dispute Sarah Ann, for we all knew that old Miss Gowdy
worked for the meetin' house as long as she could work for anything.
She loved the Methodist meetin' house better than she loved husband or
children, though she wuz a good wife and mother. She died with cramps,
and her last request wuz to have this hymn sung to her funeral:</p>

<blockquote><div>[Illustration: &quot;I LOVE THY KINGDOM, LORD.&quot;]<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>&quot;I love thy kingdom, Lord,<br />
The house of thine abode,<br />
The church our dear Redeemer bought<br />
With His most precious blood.&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The quire all loved Mother Gowdy, and sung it accordin' to her wishes,
and broke down, I well remember, at the third verse - </p>

<blockquote><div>&quot;For her my tears shall fall,<br />
For her my prayers ascend,<br />
For her my toil and life be given,<br />
Till life and toil shall end.&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The quire broke down, and the minister himself shed tears to think how
she had carried out her belief all her life, and died with the thought
of the church she loved on her heart and its name on her lips.</p>

<p>Wall, the dress would sell at the least calculation for eight dollars;
the storekeeper had offered that, but Sarah Ann hoped it would bring ten
to the fair.</p>

<p>It wuz a cross to Sarah Ann, so we could see, for she had loved Mother
Gowdy dretful well, and loved the uncle who had gin it to her, and she
hadn't a nice black dress to her back. But she said she hadn't lived
with Mother Gowdy twenty years for nothin', and see how she would always
sacrifice anything and everything but principle for the good of the
meetin' house.</p>

<p>Sister Gowdy is a good-hearted woman, and we all on us honored her for
this act of hern, though we felt it wuz almost too much for her to do
it.</p>

<p>Wall, Sister Gowdy wuz the last one to gin in her testimony, and havin'
got through relatin' our experiences we proceeded to business and
paperin'.</p>
