<p>Night was closing in when Mike Murphy pointed the <em>Deerfoot</em>
northward and circled around the end of Squirrel Island, and turning
eastward glided midway between it and Ocean Point, the lower extremity
of Linekin Neck. He was now headed toward the ocean, and passed
above Ram Island light. That being accomplished, he caught the
swell of the Atlantic, long and heaving, but not enough so to
cause him the least misgiving.</p>

<p>He was doing a very rash thing. He ought to have gone to Southport
and there awaited the return of his friends, but the reckless
bent of his disposition caused him to make this excursion preparatory
to returning home.</p>

<p>"It will be something to brag about to the byes, as dad used
to say whin his friends carried him home after he'd been battered
up by them that engaged in a friendly dispoot with him."</p>

<p>He decided to keep to the eastward until clear of the numerous
islands, and then make a circuit and return to Southport.</p>

<p>Now the National Motor Boat law contains a number of rigid requirements,
of which Mike Murphy knew nothing. Such ignorance was excusable,
since he had never been on the launch at night. His lack of knowledge
on these points was almost certain to bring serious trouble.</p>

<p>In the first place, the <em>Deerfoot</em> belonged to what is
known as the Second Class of motor boats, which includes all that
are twenty-six feet or more and less than forty feet in length.
Such craft are required to display at night a bright white light
as near the stem as practicable and a white light aft to show
all around the horizon. With these safeguards a motor boat can
be easily located, except in a fog, when the foghorn must be kept
going. As Mike plunged through the gloom he never thought of the
necessity of displaying lights. It would be a miracle, therefore,
if he was not overtaken by disaster.</p>

<p>And yet it may be doubted whether such a precaution would have
helped him, since he was equally ignorant of the rules of the
road. If an approaching steamer or large craft sounded a single
blast from its whistle, he would not have suspected that it was
an order for him to go to starboard, or the right, or that two
whistle blasts directed him to turn to port, or the opposite direction.
Such are the rules by day. For government at night, the following
doggerel is helpful:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"When both side lights you see ahead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Port your helm and show your red,<br/>
Green to green, or red to red,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect safety, go ahead.

</p>
<p>
When upon your port is seen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A stranger's starboard light of green,<br/>
There's not so much for you to do,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For green to port keeps clear of you."

</p>
</div>
<p>All this, I repeat, was unknown to Mike, who having gone half
a dozen miles to sea, decided it was time to circle about and
return home. He retained a fair idea of his bearings. The distant
glimmer of lights to the westward indicated, as he believed, Squirrel
Island. Ram Island light was nearer, and the blinking star farthest
away was the government warning on Burnt Island.</p>

<p>All this was true, and the youth sitting with his hands on the
wheel and gliding swiftly forward saw nothing to cause alarm.
This self-complacency, however, was suddenly broken by the abrupt
appearance of a white light dead ahead. A second glance told him
it was not far off and was rapidly bearing down upon him. He swung
over the steering wheel, so as to go to the right, but the next
instant he saw that the big ship was still coming toward him as
if determined to run him down.</p>

<p>The startled Mike was so rattled for the moment, that instead
of using his whistle, he sprang to his feet and shouted:</p>

<p>"Kaap off! kaap off, or I'll run over ye!"</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether his voice carried to anyone on the
schooner, for none there could know that a small boat was directly
ahead. Mike heard the rush of the water against her towering bow,
saw the gleam of several lights, and for a moment believed it
was all over with him. There were precious few seconds at his
command, but pulling himself together, he whirled the wheel around
and the next minute slid along the length of the black hull, so
near that he could have touched it with his outstretched hand.
One of the wondering crew chanced to catch sight of the small
craft as it shot by and called out:</p>

<p>"What boat is that?"</p>

<p>"The <em>Olympic</em> just come in from Cork!"</p>

<p>"You fool! where are your lights?"</p>

<p>"Don't need 'em. Ye may thank yer stars that I didn't run ye
down and split ye in two, but don't get too gay wid me."</p>

<p>It was a close call. Mike remembered now that he ought to have
displayed lights, but he hesitated to leave the wheel for that
purpose, and it seemed to him that nothing of the kind was likely
to be repeated.</p>

<p>"There'll be more lights showing by and by and I can git along
without 'em."</p>

<p>He did not dream that he was flagrantly violating the law and
was liable to be punished therefore. His anxiety was now to get
back to Southport without more delay.</p>

<p>"It isn't on account of dad," he said to himself, "for he was
so mad two hours ago that he can't get any madder, but it's mesilf
that's beginning to feel lonely."</p>

<p>He had been so much interested with every phase of his novel
experience that, strange as it may seem, up to this time he had
forgotten the lunch which he bought at the Isle of Springs before
the boatman rowed him across to Westport. Suddenly it struck him
that he was never in all his life so hungry. The sandwiches were
somewhat mashed out of shape from having been carried so long
in his pocket, but they could not have tasted better.</p>

<p>"The one sad fayture about 'em is that there isn't a dozen times
as many, as Barney O'Toole remarked whin he found he had only
two Corkonians to fight.</p>

<p>"I won't say anything about this ghost of a maal whin I arrive
at home, and mither will be so touched wid pity that after reminding
dad to give me a big whaling she will allow me to ate up all that
happens to be in the house."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Mike became aware of a wonderfully strange
thing: Burnt Island light instead of winking at him from the westward
had danced round to the extremity of Linekin Neck, on the north.
Not to be outdone, Ram Island light had whisked far up in the
same direction. Other illuminations had also taken part in the
mix-up till things were topsy turvy.</p>

<p>You know that when a person is lost, the points of the compass
seem to go astray, which peculiar fact will explain the mystification
of Mike Murphy. He was sensible enough, however, to know that
the confusion was with himself, and he held the boat to a true
course. Not long after, he was startled by striking some obstruction,
though so slight that it did not jar the craft.</p>

<p>"And phwat could that be?" he asked, rising with one hand on
the wheel while he peered into the gloom. "It couldn't have been
that ship that got swung round and got in my way, and I run her
down. If it was the same, she warn't showing any lights&mdash;ah! I
mind what it is. The <em>Deerfut</em> has run over somebody's
lobster pot, which the same signifies that it's mesilf that is
the biggest lobster of all fur coming thus out of me road."</p>

<p>It will be recalled that the night was unusually dark, relieved
now and then by bits of moonlight which struggled through the
clouds. At no time, however, was Mike able to see more than a
few rods in any direction. As a rule, he could barely make out
the flag fluttering at the bow.</p>

<p>Just beyond the point where he ran over the lobster pot, a rift
in the clouds revealed the vague outlines of a small rowboat,
and the head and shoulders of two men. If they carried a lighted
lantern, it was in the bottom of their craft, and Mike saw nothing
of it. They were so far to the right that there was no danger
of collision, and he hailed them.</p>

<p>"Ship ahoy! Where bound?"</p>

<p>"None of yer bus'ness," was the answer. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"The same to yersilf; if I had ye on boord I'd hammer some good
manners into ye."</p>

<p>These threatening words evidently scared the couple, who, not
knowing how many were on the larger boat, decided not to run any
risk. Mike, despite his brief sojourn in Maine, had heard of the
illegal practice of many persons on the coast who gathered lobsters
of less length than the law prescribes. He could not avoid giving
the men a parting shot:</p>

<p>"I'll mind to report that ye are the spalpeens that are scooping
in short lobsters."</p>

<p>They made no reply, for it is not impossible that the youth spoke
the truth when he made the charge.</p>

<p>"I'm hoping that the world will soon get tired of twisting round
the wrong way, for it's hard to convince mesilf that I'm not right,
which the same don't often happen wid me. As I figure out it's
a straight coorse to Southport. If me dad has forgot to show a
signal light at home or at Mr. Landon's, I may run down the island
before I obsarves the same&mdash;phwat does that maan?"</p>

<p>The engine was plainly going badly, and the trouble steadily
grew more marked. He had not the remotest idea of the cause.</p>

<p>"I wonder now if the same is growing tired; I oughter been more
marciful and give the ingine a rist."</p>

<p>He listened closely, and a fear crept into his throat. If a breakdown
should take place, he would be in bad situation, not knowing what
to do and far beyond all help.</p>

<p>Suddenly the engine came to a dead standstill. He swung the fly-wheel
around but there was no response. The <em>Deerfoot</em> was out
of commission. He sighed:</p>

<p>"Here's where I stop, as Terence O'Flaherty said whin he walked
aginst the side of his house."</p>
