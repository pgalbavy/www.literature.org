<p>WHEN the Good Wolf had drawn the red sled with Barty on it nearly
to the edge of the deep forest, he stopped. "Now," he said, "you
must get off and unharness me."
</p>
<p>Then Barty suddenly thought of something. "What shall I say when my
mother asks me where I got my new sled?"
</p><p>"Well," answered the Good Wolf, "I think I shall have to be a kind
of secret. Mothers are very easily frightened and I wouldn't
frighten a mother for anything. You might tell her it is a present
from an intimate friend, and if she asks what his name is you can
say it is Mr. Wolf. Have you got your whip safe?"
</p><p>Barty took it out of his pocket. Now that he was his real size
again it looked very tiny.
</p><p>"I would advise you to go into a quiet place in the forest when you
crack that whip," said the Good Wolf. "If any one came when you
were playing circus your little animals would suddenly grow big
again and that would be very inconvenient."
</p><p>"There is a very quiet place I know of," answered Barty. "It is my
secret playing place. You have to creep through bushes to get to
it. It is round and has grass on it. It will make a beautiful
circus. But when will you come back and see me?"
</p><p>"I don't know yet, but I will come some time," answered the Good
Wolf. "I am glad I happened to be at the edge of the forest this
morning. There is some pleasure in taking a boy like you, who is a
blessing and a privilege, to a Snow Feast. Now I must go."
</p><p>Once he shook himself, twice he shook himself, three times he shook
himself, and he was a wolf again.
</p><p>"Good-bye," he said, "until we meet again." And off he trotted.
</p><p>Barty went back to his house dragging his red sled after him and
thinking about things, until his cheeks were as red as his coat.
</p><p>His mother was very busy making bread, but when she saw him she was
so surprised that she stopped kneading her dough.
</p><p>"Where did you get that splendid sled?" she asked.
</p><p>"Some one in the forest gave it to me," answered Barty. "He said he
was my intimate friend and his name was Mr. Wolf. I think," and
Barty hesitated a little as he remembered, "I do think he was a
kind of a fairy."
</p><p>His mother laughed. "I should think he was too, if he gave me such
a nice present as that," she said, and she went on with her
kneading.
</p><p>Barty played with his sled all the rest of the day, and at night he
put it in a very safe corner in the woodshed. Before he went to
sleep he hid the tiny whip under his pillow.
</p><p>"But I do feel, now that I can't see either of them," he whispered
to himself as he lay in the dark, "I do feel as if it must have
been a dream. Was it?" And he had to put his hand under his pillow
and touch the whip before he could go to sleep.
</p><p>It was curious, but the first thing when he wakened in the morning
he found himself sitting up in bed and rubbing his eyes and saying
aloud to himself:
</p><p>"Was it? Was it? Was it?"
</p><p>Then he remembered the tiny whip and he darted his hand under his
pillow, but he felt nothing. He lifted the pillow and looked under
it, but he saw nothing. He jumped out of bed and shook the sheet
and shook it, but he felt nothing. The tiny whip was gone.
</p><p>He just stood and stared, and then he said rather slowly:
</p><p>"Well, if it was a dream it was the nicest one I ever had and I'm
glad I had it. Perhaps some night I shall have it again." And he
dressed himself quickly and ran downstairs.
</p><p>And this was the first thing his mother said to him as she came in
from the wood shed:
</p><p>"I've just been looking at your new sled, Barty, and it is the
nicest one I ever saw."
</p><p>"Oh!" Barty almost shouted, "is it in the woodshed? Is it?" And he
flew out to look, and there it was! And it was just as red and just
as jingling and just as beautiful as ever.
</p><p>"The Good Wolf wasn't a dream," he cried joyfully. "And so the
other wasn't."
</p><p>But as the days went by and he wished more and more that he could
find the little whip and make sure that the tiny lions and tigers
and elephants had been real, he used to go and sit down very hard
on the red sled and say out loud ever so many times:
</p><p>"It wasn't a dream--it wasn't--it wasn't--it wasn't one! and that
would make him feel quite cheerful."
</p><p>One quite beautiful morning, after the snow had gone away, he was
in his bedroom and he suddenly caught sight of something bright,
shining under a wardrobe.
</p><p>"I wonder what that is," he said, feeling his heart begin to beat.
He crept to the wardrobe as if he thought the bright thing would
get away if it heard him, and suddenly he dropped on his knees,
thrust his arm far under the wardrobe, quite against the wall, and
pulled out the bright thing--and it was the whip. The bright part
was the gold handle. It had rolled out from under the pillow and
had rested on the edge of the bed until it had been shaken off and
rolled under the wardrobe and stayed there. Barty gave a shout.
</p><p>"There," he cried, "I said it wasn't a dream--and it wasn't one!"
</p><p>He was so excited that he almost did a dangerous thing. He almost
cracked the whip right in his bedroom, but he remembered just in
time that if he did, and the little animals came and his mother
came too, they would grow big all at once at sight of her, and it
would be enough to frighten any mother to death--besides the room
being so small that it wouldn't hold even a single elephant. 87
</p><p>"I'd better be careful," he said to himself, "I'm glad I thought of
that in time."
</p><p>When he got outside he really couldn't wait until he got into the
deep forest, and was under the trees, flying along the path which
led to the bushes which hid his secret place. It was a very secret
place. You had to crawl through a sort of tunnel until you crawled
through a hole into a clear green place with a close hedge of
bushes round it, except where there was a high rock at the back--a
great big rock with a cave in it. Barty had never been into the
cave because it rather frightened him. He thought it looked like a
Robber's Cave, though he had never seen any robbers about, and
anyway there was only a long narrow slit in the rock for any one to
squeeze in and out of. A fat robber could never have got in. Barty
crawled through the hole in the bushes and stood up on his feet,
quite out of breath. His eyes were sparkling with joy.
</p><p>"Now then," he said when he had his breath again. "Now then!" And
he stood in the middle of the green circle and cracked his whip.
</p><p>It was such a little whip that it made only a little crack. And at
first nothing came.
</p><p>"Shake yourself once--shake yourself twice--shake yourself three
times," he said. "Perhaps I had better crack it three times." And
three times he cracked it as loud as ever he could. After he had
done it he stood quite still and listened.
</p><p>He listened and listened, and the deep forest seemed so still that
he could hear himself breathe. He listened and listened again, and
it seemed so still that he felt as if he could hear himself think.
Then he listened again, and he heard a faint, faint rustle. It
sounded far away and he did not know where it came from. But
presently he knew it was coming nearer. Yes, it was coming nearer
and nearer and it seemed to be coming from the right side and from
the left and from before and behind him, and it grew louder and
louder until it sounded like scampering and like shuffling and like
jumping and like little trotting hoofs. And in about three minutes
two little lions jumped over the bushes and two little tigers
followed them and two little leopards after them, and two little
bears came shuffling through the hole at the end of the tunnel, and
two tiny hippopotamuses and two rhinoceroses, and two lovely
elephants who marched into the middle of the ring and threw up
their trunks and trumpeted; and last of all four splendid little
horses, one snow white and one jet black and two with beautiful
brown spots on them, leaped over the hedge and made a bow to Barty,
bending their heads and scraping with their feet, and wheeled about
and began to gallop round and round the ring as fast as ever they
could, just as if they were at a real circus.
</p><p>"Oh, I said it wasn't a dream!" shouted Barty. "And it isn't--it
isn't--it isn't! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! And he jumped up and down
and laughed for joy, and stamped and stamped and stamped. Then they
all crowded round him as if they felt just as happy as he did.
</p><p>"Didn't you want us before?" they said. "What a long time you were
in calling us."
</p><p>"I lost my whip," answered Barty, and when they all cried out
"Oh-h-h!" he suddenly felt as if he must turn round and look
behind, and when he did it he saw that the nicest thing in the
world had happened. There sat the Good Wolf near the bushes,
smiling at him. He could not help running to him and hugging him.
</p><p>"Oh, I am glad! I am glad!" he said. "This is the nicest thing of
all!"
</p><p>"It is nice," answered the Good Wolf. "I was hunting in Russia and
I wasn't sure I could come. But I must attend to this whip
business."
</p><p>He shook his blue ear and a narrow, rather long ivory box fell out.
</p><p>"That is a whip box," he said, and he began to scratch in the earth
until he made a rather deep hole under a bush. "Now," he said,
"whenever you have done with your whip you must lock it in that box
and put it in this hole, and you will always know where to find
it."
</p><p>"I will never forget," said Barty.
</p><p>The circus they had that morning was ten times as nice as the one
they had had before.
</p><p>"Oh, what fun it would be," said Barty, "if we had a little clown."
He wasn't hinting in the least, he only said it because it just
came into his head, and he had no sooner said it than the Good Wolf
walked forward.
</p><p>"Now I should like to know," he said, "why I never thought once of
that. It was perfectly ridiculous of me."
</p><p>He gave his pink ear a flip and out flew a tiny clown in baggy
white trousers with his hands stuck in the pockets, and a frill
round his neck and a red and white painted face. And he turned
sixteen somersaults one after the other and bounced onto his feet
and stuck out his tongue, and said in a cracked little shrill voice
just like a big clown: "Here we are again, sir. How are you
to-morrow?"
</p><p>And this was such a tremendous joke that it was not only Barty who
laughed till he rolled over, but every single little animal laughed
till it rolled over, and the grass was just covered with little
elephants and lions and tigers and bears and the rest, rolling
about and holding their sides. There is no knowing when they would
have stopped, but in the midst of it the Good Wolf shook his blue
ear and out flew the prettiest little circus lady in the world. She
had pink tights on and wore so many short gauzy spangled skirts
that she looked like a fairy, and she whirled round and round on
the very tips of her toes, and sprang onto the backs of two of the
prettiest horses--one foot on each back--and went galloping round
the ring like lightning, smiling and kissing her hand to everybody.
</p><p>That was why the circus was ten times nicer than it had been
before. Everything was there. And Barty went on being ring-master
and the circus grew more and more delightful and more and more
exciting, until at last the whole entertainment was tired and had
to sit down and rest and fan itself because it was actually hot.
</p><p>They all sat in a circle, and because none of the animals were as
big as kittens, Barty looked like a very pretty giant with rosy
cheeks and curly hair. The animals had grown so fond of him that
they all sat and looked at him affectionately, and the nearest
elephant and lion perfectly cuddled up against him. The beautiful
little lady circus rider perched on his hand and the clown sat down
on his shoe.
</p><p>"I am very glad to have made your acquaintance," the little lady
said. "I admire you very much. You make a most delightful
ring-master."
</p><p>"We all like him," said the biggest little lion. "And we all mean
to stand by him. I came to him from the Nubian desert this morning,
and it is a long way off."
</p><p>"I love every one of you," said Barty. "I don't believe there is
any other boy in the world who has such delightful friends."
</p><p>He stroked the lion's side, and he was just going to put his cheek
against his mane, when he stopped suddenly and stared with wide
open eyes at the long narrow opening in the big rock at the other
side of the green circus. A thin, wicked face with evil shining
black eyes was peering out and watching him and his animals.
</p><p>He started so that he almost dropped the little lion. And that
minute he saw another thin wicked face, and another above that and
another above that, all glaring at him. And the owner of the first
wicked face began to wriggle his long body through the narrow slit,
and in about two minutes he had wriggled his way out and stood
grinning, with swords and pistols and knives hung at his belt.
</p><p>"He is a thin robber!" gasped Barty. "I knew a fat one could never
get in and out. It is a Robber's Cave."
