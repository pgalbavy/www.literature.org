<p>Harry listened attentively whilst I recounted all the events that
I have narrated in these pages. The thing that bewildered and
astonished him most was to find that all along the diamonds had
been in my possession—or rather in Suzanne’s. That was a fact he
had never suspected. Of course, after hearing his story, I realized
the point of Carton’s little arrangement—or rather Nadina’s, since
I had no doubt that it was her brain which had conceived the plan.
No surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could
result in the seizure of the diamonds. The secret was locked in
her own brain, and the “Colonel” was not likely to guess that they
had been entrusted to the keeping of an ocean steward!
</p>
<p>Harry’s vindication from the old charge of theft seemed assured.
It was the other, graver charge that paralyzed all our activities.
For, as things stood, he could not come out in the open to prove
his case.
</p><p>The one thing we came back to, again and again, was the identity
of the “Colonel.” Was he, or was he not, Guy Pagett?
</p><p>“I should say he was but for one thing,” said Harry. “It seems
pretty much of a certainty that it was Pagett who murdered Anita
Grünberg at Marlow—and that certainly lends colour to the
supposition that he is actually the ‘Colonel,’ since Anita’s
business was not of the nature to be discussed with a subordinate.
No—the only thing that militates against that theory is the attempt
to put you out of the way on the night of your arrival here. You
saw Pagett left behind at Cape Town—by no possible means could he
have arrived here before the following Wednesday. He is unlikely
to have any emissaries in this part of the world, and all his plans
were laid to deal with you in Cape Town. He might, of course, have
cabled instructions to some lieutenant of his in Johannesburg, who
could have joined the Rhodesian train at Mafeking, but his
instructions would have had to be particularly definite to allow
of that note being written.”
</p><p>We sat silent for a moment, then Harry went on slowly: “You say
that Mrs. Blair was asleep when you left the hotel and that you
heard Sir Eustace dictating to Miss Pettigrew? Where was Colonel
Race?”
</p><p>“I could not find him anywhere.”
</p><p>“Had he any reason to believe that—you and I might be friendly with
each other?”
</p><p>“He might have had,” I answered thoughtfully, remembering our
conversation on the way back from the Matoppos. “He’s a very
powerful personality,” I continued, “but not at all my idea of the
‘Colonel.’ And, anyway, such an idea would be absurd. He’s in the
Secret Service.”
</p><p>“How do we know that he is? It’s the easiest thing in the world to
throw out a hint of that kind. No one contradicts it, and the
rumour spreads until every one believes it as gospel truth. It
provides an excuse for all sorts of doubtful doings. Anne, do you
like Race?”
</p><p>“I do—and I don’t. He repels me and at the same time fascinates
me; but I know one thing, I’m always a little afraid of him.”
</p><p>“He was in South Africa, you know, at the time of the Kimberley
robbery,” said Harry slowly.
</p><p>“But it was he who told Suzanne all about the ‘Colonel’ and how he
had been in Paris trying to get on his track.”
</p><p><u>“Camouflage</u>—of a particularly clever kind.”
</p><p>“But where does Pagett come in? Is he in Race’s pay?”
</p><p>“Perhaps,” said Harry slowly, “he doesn’t come in at all.”
</p><p>“What?”
</p><p>“Think back, Anne. Did you ever hear Pagett’s own account of that
night on the _Kilmorden?”_
</p><p>“Yes—through Sir Eustace.”
</p><p>I repeated it. Harry listened closely.
</p><p>“He saw a man coming from the direction of Sir Eustace’s cabin and
followed him up on deck. Is that what he says? Now, who had the
cabin opposite to Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Supposing Colonel Race
crept up on deck, and, foiled in his attack on you, fled round the
deck and met Pagett just coming through the saloon door. He knocks
him down and springs inside, closing the door. We dash round and
find Pagett lying there. How’s that?”
</p><p>“You forget that he declares positively it was you who knocked him
down.”
</p><p>“Well, suppose that just as he regains consciousness he sees me
disappearing in the distance? Wouldn’t he take it for granted that
I was his assailant? Especially as he thought all along it was I
he was following?”
</p><p>“It’s possible, yes,” I said slowly. “But it alters all our ideas.
And there are other things.”
</p><p>“Most of them are open to explanation. The man who followed you in
Cape Town spoke to Pagett, and Pagett looked at his watch. The man
might have merely asked him the time.”
</p><p>“It was just a coincidence, you mean?”
</p><p>“Not exactly. There’s a method in all this, connecting Pagett with
the affair. Why was the Mill House chosen for the murder? Was it
because Pagett had been in Kimberley when the diamonds were stolen?
Would <u>he</u> have been made the scapegoat if I had not appeared so
providentially upon the scene?”
</p><p>“Then you think he may be entirely innocent?”
</p><p>“It looks like it, but, if so, we’ve got to find out what he was
doing in Marlow. If he’s got a reasonable explanation of that,
we’re on the right tack.”
</p><p>He got up.
</p><p>“It’s past midnight. Turn in, Anne, and get some sleep. Just before
dawn I’ll take you over in the boat. You must catch the train at
Livingstone. I’ve got a friend there who will keep you hidden away
until the train starts. You go to Bulawayo and catch the Beira
train there. I can find out from my friend in Livingstone what’s
going on at the hotel and where your friends are now.”
</p><p>“Beira,” I said meditatively.
</p><p>“Yes, Anne, it’s Beira for you. This is man’s work. Leave it to
me.”
</p><p>We had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the
situation out, but it was on us again now. We did not even look at
each other.
</p><p>“Very well,” I said, and passed into the hut.
</p><p>I lay down on the skin-covered couch, but I didn’t sleep, and
outside I could hear Harry Rayburn pacing up and down, up and down
through the long dark hours. At last he called me:
</p><p>“Come, Anne, it’s time to go.”
</p><p>I got up and came out obediently. It was still quite dark, but I
knew that dawn was not far off.
</p><p>“We’ll take the canoe, not the motor-boat——” Harry began, when
suddenly he stopped dead and held up his hand.
</p><p>“Hush! What’s that?”
</p><p>I listened, but could hear nothing. His ears were sharper than
mine, however, the ears of a man who has lived long in the
wilderness. Presently I heard it too—the faint splash of paddles
in the water coming from the direction of the right bank of the
river and rapidly approaching our little landing-stage.
</p><p>We strained our eyes in the darkness, and could make out a dark
blur on the surface of the water. It was a boat. Then there was a
momentary spurt of flame. Some one had struck a match. By its light
I recognized one figure, the red-bearded Dutchman of the villa at
Muizenberg. The others were natives.
</p><p>“Quick—back to the hut.”
</p><p>Harry swept me back with him. He took down a couple of rifles and
a revolver from the wall.
</p><p>“Can you load a rifle?”
</p><p>“I never have. Show me how.”
</p><p>I grasped his instructions well enough. We closed the door and
Harry stood by the window which overlooked the landing-stage. The
boat was just about to run alongside it.
</p><p>“Who’s that?” called out Harry in a ringing voice.
</p><p>Any doubt we might have had as to our visitors’ intentions was
swiftly resolved. A hail of bullets splattered round us. Fortunately
neither of us was hit. Harry raised the rifle. It spat murderously,
and again and again. I heard two groans and a splash.
</p><p>“That’s given ’em something to think about,” he muttered grimly,
as he reached for the second rifle. “Stand well back, Anne, for
God’s sake. And load quickly.”
</p><p>More bullets. One just grazed Harry’s cheek. His answering fire
was more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he
turned for it. He caught me close with his left arm and kissed me
once savagely before he turned to the window again. Suddenly he
uttered a shout.
</p><p>“They’re going—had enough of it. They’re a good mark out there on
the water, and they can’t see how many of us there are. They’re
routed for the moment—but they’ll come back. We’ll have to get
ready for them.” He flung down the rifle and turned to me.
</p><p>“Anne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a
lion. Black-haired witch!”
</p><p>He caught me in his arms. He kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth.
</p><p>“And now to business,” he said, suddenly releasing me. “Get out
those tins of paraffin.”
</p><p>I did as I was told. He was busy inside the hut. Presently I saw
him on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his
arms. He rejoined me in a minute or two.
</p><p>“Go down to the boat. We’ll have to carry it across the island to
the other side.”
</p><p>He picked up the paraffin as I disappeared.
</p><p>“They’re coming back,” I called softly. I had seen the blur moving
out from the opposite shore.
</p><p>He ran down to me.
</p><p>“Just in time. Why—where the hell’s the boat?” Both had been cut
adrift. Harry whistled softly. “We’re in a tight place, honey.
Mind?”
</p><p>“Not with you.”
</p><p>“Ah, but dying together’s not much fun. We’ll do better than that.
See—they’ve got two boat-loads this time. Going to land at two
different points. Now for my little scenic effect.”
</p><p>Almost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut. Its light
illuminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof.
</p><p>“My old clothes—stuffed with rags—but they won’t tumble to it for
some time. Come, Anne, we’ve got to try desperate means.”
</p><p>Hand in hand, we raced across the island. Only a narrow channel of
water divided it from the shore on that side.
</p><p>“We’ve got to swim for it. Can you swim at all, Anne? Not that it
matters. I can get you across. It’s the wrong side for a boat——too
many rocks, but the right side for swimming, and the right side
for Livingstone.”
</p><p>“I can swim a little—farther than that. What’s the danger, Harry?”
For I had seen the grim look on his face. “Sharks?”
</p><p>“No, you little goose. Sharks live in the sea. But you’re sharp,
Anne. Crocs, that’s the trouble.”
</p><p>“Crocodiles?”
</p><p>“Yes, don’t think of them—or say your prayers, whichever you feel
inclined.”
</p><p>We plunged in. My prayers must have been efficacious, for we
reached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and
dripping on the bank.
</p><p>“Now for Livingstone. It’s rough going, I’m afraid, and wet clothes
won’t make it any better. But it’s got to be done.”
</p><p>That walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs,
and my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns. Finally I
stopped, utterly exhausted. Harry came back to me.
</p><p>“Hold up, honey. I’ll carry you for a bit.”
</p><p>That was the way I came into Livingstone, slung across his shoulder
like a sack of coals. How he did it for all that way, I don’t know.
The first faint light of dawn was just breaking. Harry’s friend
was a young man of twenty odd who kept a store of native curios.
His name was Ned—perhaps he had another, but I never heard it. He
didn’t seem in the least surprised to see Harry walk in, dripping
wet, holding an equally dripping female by the hand. Men are very
wonderful.
</p><p>He gave us food to eat, and hot coffee, and got our clothes dried
for us whilst we rolled ourselves in Manchester blankets of gaudy
hue. In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation
whilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had
become of Sir Eustace’s party, and whether any of them were still
at the hotel.
</p><p>It was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to
go to Beira. I never meant to, anyway, but now all reason for such
proceedings had vanished. The point of the plan had been that my
enemies believed me dead. Now that they knew I wasn’t dead, my
going to Beira would do no good whatever. They could easily follow
me there and murder me quietly. I should have no one to protect
me. It was finally arranged that I should join Suzanne, wherever
she was, and devote all my energies to taking care of myself. On
no account was I to seek adventures or endeavour to checkmate the
“Colonel.”
</p><p>I was to remain quietly with her and await instructions from Harry.
The diamonds were to be deposited in the Bank at Kimberley under
the name of Parker.
</p><p>“There’s one thing,” I said thoughtfully, “we ought to have a code
of some kind. We don’t want to be hoodwinked again by messages
purporting to come from one to the other.”
</p><p>“That’s easy enough. Any message that comes <u>genuinely</u> from me
will have the word ‘and’ crossed out in it.”
</p><p>“Without trade-mark, none genuine,” I murmured. “What about wires?”
</p><p>“Any wires from me will be signed ‘Andy.’”
</p><p>“Train will be in before long, Harry,” said Ned, putting his head
in and withdrawing it immediately.
</p><p>I stood up.
</p><p>“And shall I marry a nice steady man if I find one?” I asked
demurely.
</p><p>Harry came close to me.
</p><p>“My God! Anne, if you ever marry any one else but me, I’ll wring
his neck. And as for you——”
</p><p>“Yes,” I said, pleasurably excited.
</p><p>“I shall carry you away and beat you black and blue!”
</p><p>“What a delightful husband I have chosen,” I said satirically. “And
doesn’t he change his mind overnight!”
