<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>At ten o'clock that night I sat in the coffee-room of the "Virginia
Arms," outwardly cool enough, I trust, but terribly excited nevertheless,
and scarce able to touch the food on my plate.</p>

<p>Heretofore, although I have always dreaded physical pain, I may
truthfully say that the prospect of it had never deterred me from
facing necessary danger; and I can also maintain that, until the
present moment, the possibility of disaster to me or mine had
never terrified me beforehand.</p>

<p>Now it was different; I seemed to be utterly unable to contemplate
with philosophy the chance of misfortune to Silver Heels, through
failure of my plans or accident to my proper person. It was, I
think, responsibility and not cowardice that frightened me; for
who was there to take care of Silver Heels if anything happened
to me?</p>

<p>One by one I counted and discounted the dangers I ran: first,
arrest at any moment as an accomplice of the notorious Jack Mount;
second, assassination by Dunmore's agents; third, assassination
by Butler's company; fourth, arrest and imprisonment as a suspected
rebel and open advocate of sedition; fifth, danger from the Cayugas
after our escape from Fort Pitt.</p>

<p>Should any of these things befall me, as well they might, what
in the world would become of Silver Heels? Small wonder I found
no heart to eat, though this totally new condition of mind parched
me with a thirst so persistent that my host, James Rolfe, was
obliged to caution me and bring me to my senses ere I had dulled
them hopelessly in his brown home-brew.</p>

<p>The post-chaise, loaded and ready for a three weeks' journey,
stood in the mews with the four strong horses harnessed, and Jack
Mount at their heads. He and the Weasel were to ride as post-boys,
with Shemuel and I in front.</p>

<p>It lacked an hour yet of the time appointed, and it was the suspense
of that hour's waiting which set every nerve in my body aching.
If we could only have gone somewhere else to wait!&mdash;but where
could we go and find safety from warrants in this little town
where every patriot inn was known? Certainly it was better for
us to endure the strain here among sympathizers, where we could
count on our host and on his guests and on every servant from
stable to kitchen.</p>

<p>The arms and ammunition which the Weasel had purchased were now
properly stowed in the post-chaise. Rifles and pistols had been
primed and loaded, powder-horns replenished, flint and ball fitted,
and pans oiled.</p>

<p>Again and again I went out into the mews, leaving my food untasted,
only to find Mount standing quietly at the horses' heads and the
Weasel pacing up and down, plunged in reverie.</p>

<p>At last Shemuel appeared, slinking past the lighted inn windows
and into the mews, where we waited in the starlight, rubbing his
hands and peering about with alert obsequiousness and an apparent
inability to appreciate the tension that I, for one, quivered
under.</p>

<p>"I haff sold all my goots," he remarked, cheerfully; "my packets
I haff stored mit my friends at dose 'Bear and Cubs.' I puy me
Delaware paskets in Baltimore&mdash;eh, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Here are your pistols," I said; "do you know how to use them?"</p>

<p>"Ach yess," he replied, with a sly smile at Mount, who grunted,
and said:</p>

<p>"Shemmy is just as handy with pistols as he is with his needles.
No fear, Mr. Cardigan," and looking around, he motioned the peddler
to his side.</p>

<p>"I hear that the Monongahela is in flood," he said. "Is the wooden
bridge all right, Shemmy?"</p>

<p>Shemuel did not know and went away to inquire, returning presently
from the stables with the information that heavy storms had swept
the southern mountains and the Monongahela was over its banks,
but the dam below the bridge had gone out, leaving the wooden
structure safe.</p>

<p>"Then there won't be a ford for twenty miles," muttered Mount,
"and I'm glad of it. Shemmy, just borrow four new axes of Rolfe,
will you? And, say, just shove them into the boot!"</p>

<p>Again Shemuel disappeared, and after a short absence came trotting
back with the bundle of brand-new axes on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Are they ground?" asked Mount.</p>

<p>"You can shave mit them," said Shemuel, running his dirty thumb
along the edges. Then he shoved them into the boot and looked
cunningly up at me.</p>

<p>The slow minutes dragged on. Hands clasped behind me, I walked
up and down the muddy alley, twisting my interlocked fingers until
every nail throbbed. Mount smoked a cob-pipe and watched me; Renard
stood apart, staring up at the stars, immersed in thought; Shemuel
pattered silently among the restive horses, thumbing the harness
and poking his prying fingers into axle and unlighted coach-lamp.</p>

<p>Up and down I walked, heart beating heavily, watching the mouth
of the alley for a lurking spy, or a file of soldiers, or Heaven
knows what phantoms, which fancy conjured in my excited brain.
But I saw nothing to alarm us, and was about to recommence an
examination of the new rifle which Renard had bought me, when
we were all startled by a rattle of hoofs filling the square with
quick echoes.</p>

<p>Instantly every man there reached for his rifle; the alley itself
suddenly resounded with the clattering hoof-strokes of a hard-ridden
horse. There was a rush, a shadow, and a breathless shout from
the horseman: "Express&mdash;ho! Stand back! I pass! I pass!"</p>

<p>"It's an express," muttered Mount, lowering his long rifle to
lean on it and watch the dark rider pull his frantic horse to
its haunches and fling the bridle on the snorting creature's neck,
while he turned in his stirrups and searched his wallet by the
glow of the opening kitchen door.</p>

<p>Rolfe, in his shirt-sleeves and apron, came out of the door,
holding his hands up for the packets.</p>

<p>"Three for you, Jimmy," said the bareheaded express-rider, passing
the letters over. "Draw me a pot o' beer, for Heaven's sake."</p>

<p>"Where is your mate?" asked Rolfe, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Hiram? Full of war-arrows t'other side o' Crown Gap. Here's
his pouch."</p>

<p>"Scalped?" asked Rolfe, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I reckon he is. He never knowed nothing after the third arrow.
Them Wyandottes done it."</p>

<p>A tap-boy hurried out with the brimming pewter, and the shadowy
rider emptied it at a gulp.</p>

<p>"'Nother, Jim," he said, stolidly.</p>

<p>"There's blood onto your jaw," said Rolfe, gloomily.</p>

<p>"Ay, they drew blood. I lost my hat"&mdash;here he swore fiercely&mdash;"and
it ain't even paid for, Jim!"</p>

<p>"You orter be glad you got through, Ben Prince," said Rolfe,
grimly.</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;drat that boy! where's my beer? Oh, there you are, are
you? Gimme the pot and quit gaping. Hain't you never seed a express
before?"</p>

<p>An admiring circle of hostlers and kitchen wenches laughed hysterically.
The post-rider swaggered in his saddle and stretched out his feet
contentedly.</p>

<p>"Life ain't all skittles," he observed; "but beer is beer the
round world round!" and he drained the pot and tossed it dripping
to an honoured scullion.</p>

<p>"News o' Boston?" asked Rolfe, meaningly.</p>

<p>"Plenty! Plenty! Port Bill in force; Tommy Gage on top; Sam Adams
lying low; more redcoats landed, more on the way, more to come;
rich poorer; poor starving; that's all!"</p>

<p>He gathered his bridle and winked at a coy kitchen-maid.</p>

<p>"Your beau has went to Johnstown, Sairy," he said; "I seen him
a-training hay-foot, straw-foot, with old Sir Billy's Tryon County
milish. That reminds me, Jim"&mdash;turning to Rolfe&mdash;"I've a packet
for a certain Michael Cardigan, somewhere to be hunted up south
o' Crown Gap&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Right here!" said Rolfe, promptly, and the express passed the
letter to him. Then, with a careless, "See you later!" he wheeled
his horse short and galloped back along the alley, which rang
with shouts of "Good luck! Good luck! There's bed and bait for
you here, Benny!"</p>

<p>The crowd on the steps flocked back into the kitchen, the door
closed, then opened to let out Rolfe, who advanced towards me,
letter in one hand, flaring candle in the other.</p>

<p>"Light the coach-lamps," I whispered, and, taking the candle
and letter, sat down on a pile of pine timber to read what Sir
William had sent me:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"<em>DEAR LAD,<br/>
&</em>mdash;By runners from the Cayuga, I know how gallantly<br/>
you have conducted. Dearer than son you are to me, prouder am<br/>
I than any parent. If what we had hoped and prayed for has<br/>
failed&mdash;as I can no longer doubt&mdash;it is so ordained, and we<br/>
struggle in vain. <em>Nitor in adversum; nisi Dominus, frustra!</em>

"I am holding the Mohawks back by their very throats, but<br/>
mischief brews at the Upper Castle, whither Joseph<br/>
(Thayendanegea) has gone with the belts from me.

</p>
<p>
"Red Jacket's conduct condemns me to uneasiness. He is an<br/>
orator; the foul murder of Logan is his text. I need say no<br/>
more, save that I still hold the Mohawks back.

</p>
<p>
"Colonel John Butler, his conduct concerns me, and I needs<br/>
must view it with grief and alarm. His dishonoured son,<br/>
Walter Butler, is still absent; the elder Butler has retired<br/>
to the lakes, where I am informed he is gathering Tory<br/>
malecontents and foolish young Onondagas, for what ultimate<br/>
purpose I can only imagine.

</p>
<p>
"A most deadly and bitter feeling runs flood in Johnstown;<br/>
nightly outrages are reported to me, and I fear that the<br/>
so-called patriots are quite as blameworthy as are the<br/>
loyalists. Whig and Tory hate and wait.

</p>
<p>
"Dear lad, the sands of my life are running very swiftly. I<br/>
am so tired, so tired! Come when you can; I have much to talk<br/>
over ere these same sands run out, leaving a voided glass in<br/>
the sunlight. If you, by hazard, pass through Fort Pitt, you<br/>
will accompany Felicity on her return hither, which return I<br/>
have instantly commanded her by this express. I have received<br/>
a singular letter from my Lord Dunmore, which has astonished<br/>
me. My answer to him I delay until Felicity returns.<br/>
Doubtless she will travel hither by way of Richmond. The<br/>
escort, which Lord Dunmore must furnish, will, on their<br/>
return journey, take with them my reply to his Lordship.

</p>
<p>
"If this letter reaches you in time, come back with Felicity;<br/>
if not, come by the safe route through Richmond. Overtake her<br/>
if you can do so.

<p>
"Michael, I have had a most strange and unpleasant letter<br/>
from Sir Peter Warren, who encloses with it certain amazing<br/>
documents which he has carefully perused, to his great<br/>
mortification and discontent. These papers were lately sent<br/>
to him from Chatham dockyard, having been discovered under<br/>
the cabin flooring of the war-ship <em>Leda</em>, which his brother<br/>
lately commanded and which is now repairing at Chatham.

</p>
<p>
"The documents concern Felicity&mdash;and us all&mdash;and I wish you<br/>

the contents of these documents.

<p>My eyes were swimming when I lifted them from the sheets of paper,
now damp with dew. For a moment I rested my head on my hands,
feeling the rising tide of homesickness choking me. Then that
subtle courage, which a word from Sir William ever infused, warmed
my blood and calmed my beating heart.</p>

<p>I rose serenely, and laid the letter to the candle's flame, watching
it burn and crisp and fall in flakes which no prying spy might
decipher. Then I looked at my new watch, and was amazed to find
that it lacked but a few moments to the time set for our departure
from the "Virginia Arms."</p>

<p>Rolfe had already lighted the chaise-lamps; Shemuel had crawled
inside with our weapons, and Renard sat his post-saddle, adjusting
the stirrups; while Mount was preparing to climb into the saddle
of the nigh leader.</p>

<p>"Is it dark out there in the square?" I asked of Rolfe.</p>

<p>"I guess the lanthorns swing a-light on every seventh," he said.
"I darkened mine, but the watchman came battering and bawling
tew the door and made me light up again."</p>

<p>Mount was now in his saddle; I held my ticking time-piece under
the coach-lamp, eyes following the slow pointers travelling towards
the hour.</p>

<p>And, as I stood there, there came creeping a woman into the alley,
cloaked and bareheaded, halting and crouching to scan our chaise-lamps
under her inverted hand. Ere Rolfe or I could stop her she ran
to the horse on which Mount was sitting and caught the forest-runner
by the fringe on his sleeve. Then, in the rays of the chaise-lamp,
I knew her for the thief-taker's child.</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity, what the devil's tew pay?" said Rolfe. "Darn the
ruddled vixens who come a-drabbing into my mews, with a hussy
tew hail you afoot and a baggage tew boot on the boot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep quiet!" I said, sharply. "There's trouble abroad somewhere!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Cardigan," called Mount, softly, "Sir Timerson and a
gang o' cudgels is coming up Pitt Street and Bully Bishop's with
them!"</p>

<p>The girl turned her frightened face to me:</p>

<p>"They came for father to take Jack Mount; I ran out the back
door, sir. Oh, hasten! hasten!" she wailed, looking at Mount and
wringing her hands.</p>

<p>The big fellow stooped from his saddle and deliberately kissed
her.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear," he said; "I'll come back for another before
I die. Au large, Jimmy! Up with you, Mr. Cardigan!"</p>

<p>"Turn those horses! Take their heads!" whispered Rolfe. "There's
one back way tew every mews, and half a dozen to this!"</p>

<p>The next moment I had wheeled the chaise-and-four back into the
darkness and around a rambling row of sheds and stables, following
Rolfe, then to the left, then a demi-tour to the right, which
brought us up against a heavy stockade. But already Rolfe had
set a creaking gate swinging loosely, and we bumped out into a
field, hub-deep in buttercups.</p>

<p>"I'll keep the scratch-wigs amused," whispered Rolfe, as I climbed
to the forward seat and picked up my rifle; and away we jolted
across the star-lit pasture and out into a narrow, unlighted cattle
lane, which we followed to the bars. These Shemuel let down, popping
back into the chaise like a jack-o'-box, and Mount rode our horses
out into the dark Boundary Road.</p>

<p>There was not a soul to be seen, not a light, not a sound but
the hum of our turning wheels and the slapping trot of our horses.</p>

<p>Presently, on a dark hillock to our right, I saw lighted windows
glimmering among trees, and I called in a low voice to Mount and
sprang noiselessly to the road. A lane led around the hillock
to the right; up this dim path I conducted the chaise-and-four
until I found room to turn them back, facing the Boundary Road
again. Here our chaise might lie concealed from passing folk on
the highway, and here I quietly bade Mount and Renard await me,
while Shemuel held the horses' heads.</p>

<p>The night was warm and fragrant under the great June stars as
I passed silently along the lane, climbed the hillock and entered
the orchard. Through the dim trees I stole towards the house,
where two windows on the ground floor were lighted up.</p>

<p>Then, as I leaned breathless against a tree, in the distant gloom
the fortress bell struck slowly, eleven times.</p>

<p>Second after second passed, minute followed minute, and my eyes
never left the closed door under the pillared porch. Presently
I looked at my watch; a quarter of an hour had passed. The seconds
began to drag, the minutes loitered. Time seemed to stand still
in the world.</p>

<p>Far away in the fortress the bell struck the half-hour, and on
the west breeze came the dull cry of sentinels calling from post
to post under the summer stars.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dark door opened; a heavy figure appeared in silhouette
against the light. My heart stood still; it was Black Betty.</p>

<p>The negress peered out into the darkness, north, west, south,
and finally looked up at the stars. Then, as though summoned from
within, she turned quickly and entered the house, leaving the
door wide open behind her.</p>

<p>Impatience was racking me now; I waited until I could wait no
longer; then, in the shadow of the trellis-vines, I stole up to
the porch. The hallway was empty; I stepped to the sill, crossed
it, and surveyed the empty stairway and the gallery above. There
was not a soul in sight. Now alarm seized me, a swift, overpowering
dread which drove me on to seek and face whatever was in store
for me. A door on my right stood open; I looked in, then entered
the smaller of two rooms, which were partly separated from each
other by folding doors. Candles burned in gilt sconces; glass
cabinets glittered; mirrors reflected my full length so abruptly
that I started at the apparitions and clutched my hunting-knife.</p>

<p>Treading on the velvet carpet I passed into the farther apartment
which, by a little gallery and waxed floor, I knew to be the ballroom.
Not a soul to be seen anywhere. Glancing hurriedly at the empty
ranks of gilded chairs, I strove to crush out the fear which was
laying icy fingers on my breast, and I had already turned to re-enter
the smaller room when I heard the front door close and voices
sounding along the outer hallway. I stepped behind a gilt cabinet
and drew my heavy knife, perfectly aware that I was trapped like
a fox in a snap-box.</p>

<p>Through the carved foliage of the cabinet I saw three people
enter the room. The skin all over my body roughened at the sight
of them; and what held me back I do not know&mdash;perhaps that kind
Providence which watches over fools&mdash;for I began to tremble in
every contracting muscle as do cats in ambush when their quarry
passes unsuspecting.</p>

<p>There they stood in low-voiced consultation &mdash;Lady Shelton,
my Lord Dunmore, and my mortal enemy, Walter Butler, tricked out
in lace and velvet. He stood so near to me that my hot hand could
have fastened on his throat-strings where I crouched. He turned
towards Dunmore with a gesture.</p>

<p>"Sir Timerson should find them to-night," he said; "your thief-taker,
Bully Bishop, is with them, I understand."</p>

<p>"They are to search every rebel rat-hole in town," cried Dunmore,
eagerly; "they should claw them ere dawn, Captain Butler. <em>Vive
Dieu, nous allons les clouer en terrain bouché!</em>"</p>

<p>Lord Dunmore leered at Lady Shelton, and then contemplated his
small French hat as though seeking countenance for his halting
tongue.</p>

<p>"If I am to conduct Miss Warren," said Butler, gloomily, "you
had best see her without delay, my Lord."</p>

<p>His round, amber eyes of a bird were fixed on Dunmore.</p>

<p>"Come now," said Dunmore, slyly, "I am half minded to conduct
her myself, Captain Butler, curse me if I am not. I hear you once
vowed to wed her in spite of Sir William and me too! Damme, I've
a notion you mean me ill, you rogue!"</p>

<p>"Your Lordship is merry," sneered Butler, but I saw his blank
eyes contracting as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Faith, I am not over-merry," said Dunmore, plaintively, drawing
a diamond pin from his wig and contemplating it. "I like not this
night journey to Williamsburg, that's flat!&mdash;and I care not if
you know it, Captain Butler."</p>

<p>"Then I pray you to release me from this duty," sneered Butler.</p>

<p>Dunmore eyed him askance, twirling his jewelled pin.</p>

<p>"If I merit your suspicions," added Butler, icily, "I beg to
wish you good fortune and good-night!" And he bowed very low and
turned curtly towards the door.</p>

<p>"No! Damme if I suspect you!" cried Dunmore, hastily. "Come back,
Captain Butler! Oh tally, man!&mdash;is there no wit in you that you
freeze at a jest from an over-fond suitor? You shall conduct Miss
Warren to Williamsburg. I say it! I mean it! Body o' Judas! am
I not to follow as soon as I hang this fellow Mount and his rabble
o' ragged pottle-pots?"</p>

<p>Butler came back, and&mdash;oh, the evil in his fixed stare as his
kindling eyes fastened on Dunmore again!</p>

<p>"Will you be pleased&mdash;to&mdash;to receive Miss Warren immediately?"
asked Lady Shelton, in a flutter of jellyfied excitement. "I have
her closely watched wherever she takes a step. She has her boxes
packed, the wilful child! Lud! she would have been gone these
two hours had not Captain Butler's man caught my footman with
a guinea!"</p>

<p>"I have a copy of her letter," squeaked Dunmore, angrily. "Faith,
I could scratch her raw for what she wrote to that dirty forest-running
fellow, Cardigan!"</p>

<p>"Fie! Fie!" tittered Lady Shelton, hysterically, shaking a fat
finger at the painted beau. "Over-fond lovers should forgive!"</p>

<p>"Curse me if I forget, though," muttered his Lordship. "If I
have to wait till Innocents' day, I'll birch the little baggage
yet!"</p>

<p>He turned nervously to Butler:</p>

<p>"You had best attend in the ballroom, Captain Butler. Gad! I
can persuade her, I think, within the half-hour. Lady Shelton,
you will be in one of your cursed twitters if you remain here,
and those same twitters set me dancing. Damme, madam! you are
twittering now! I sha'n't endure it! I can't endure it! Pluck
me bald if I can!"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I will send her to you," stammered the dowager, curtseying
in a panic.</p>

<p>"And stay away until you're wanted," added Dunmore, brutally.</p>

<p>Lady Shelton stared at him with frightened eyes; then her little
fat feet set themselves in motion, and she pattered hastily out
of the room. The men exchanged sneers.</p>

<p>"I'll be rid o' that ruddled sack o' lollypops now," observed
Lord Dunmore, complacently. "Will you not take your turn, Captain
Butler? No? Well, I owe thanks to Sir Timerson then. Pst! There's
some one on the stairs! Give me joy, Captain Butler, and mind
you keep closed eyes, you rogue!"</p>

<p>Butler gave him a contemptuous stare, then swung on his heel,
and balancing his thin hand on the hilt of his small-sword, walked
noiselessly into the dim ballroom.</p>

<p>Dunmore stood listening, passing the diamond pin back through
his wig, and shaking out the long, delicate lace on his cuffs.</p>

<p>Nobody came. He raised his spy-glass and tiptoed over to the
mirror, primping, preening, smirking, and ogling himself, occasionally
turning his good ear to the door to listen.</p>

<p>Presently he began to pace the velvet, fanning his nose with
a lace handkerchief, and simpering all to himself.</p>

<p>The extravagance of his dress might have amused me had not my
mind been filled with deadly thoughts. He was all in yellow, silk
coat, and silver-shot waistcoat, with breeches of gold brocade
and white silk stockings. Lace tumbled in soft cascades over his
claw-like fingers; a white sash and star, set with brilliants,
covered his breast; a gorgeous stock glittered under the fluffy
lace at his withered throat.</p>

<p>I noted these features, one by one, but my thoughts had flown
up-stairs to seek throughout this shameful house for the dear
maid who had given herself to me.</p>

<p>Suddenly she appeared at the door, so suddenly that Lord Dunmore
started from the mirror with a suppressed squeal of surprise.
As for me, I quivered in my lurking-place, and for a moment could
scarce see her for the mist in my eyes.</p>

<p>Yet there she stood, hesitating, smiling, her hands busy with
the buckle of a travelling-coat adorned with row on row of dainty
capes. Under the silvery gray coat I could see her little doe-skin
shoon peeping out. Now, with gloved hands, she began widening
the hood on her head, to tie it beneath her chin, with a sidelong
glance at the mirror and a faint smile for her mirrored face.</p>

<p>Never, never had I seen her so lovely, never had her eyes so
thrilled me, nor her sweet, dumb lips called to me more clearly.
For a moment I thought she had perceived me through the cabinet's
gilded foliage; but my presence was still all unsuspected.</p>

<p>At first sight of her hood and travelling-coat, Lord Dunmore
had scowled. Then, fascinated, he pretended to a trance and clasped
his hands, rolling his rheumy eyes towards heaven. Seeing her
face fall, however, he recovered quickly enough and leered at
her from head to toe.</p>

<p>"Cruel one," he piped out in ecstasy, mincing towards her. "Cruel
one, what do you ask that I may adore?"</p>

<p>"Your Lordship's pardon," she said, gravely; "I am here to ask
forgiveness."</p>

<p>"Granted! You have it," protested Dunmore, eagerly, leading her
to a chair and bowing above her as she was seated. "You have grieved
me, but man was made to grieve. I forgive, and give my love as
guerdon."</p>

<p>"You are too generous," said Silver Heels, sorrowfully; "I may
keep only your forgiveness, my Lord."</p>

<p>She would have spoken again, but Dunmore bent his stiff joints
and dropped on both knees, ogling her with watery eyes.</p>

<p>She half rose and drew back with a pleading gesture, but the
infatuated fool drowned her protests with his shrill prattle,
and clasping his transparent hands together under the lace, pleaded
his suit so passionately that my gorge rose and I could scarce
contain myself.</p>

<p>At last his chatter died away in miscellaneous noises, sniffs,
gulps, and senile sounds; and he tried to seize her gloved hand,
making a clacking smack with his thin, dry lips.</p>

<p>Silver Heels shrank deep into her chair, hiding her hands from
him under her chin, and begging him to rise, which he did at last,
scowling his displeasure.</p>

<p>Then, very gravely and pitifully, she told him that she did not
love him, that she had given her love to another, and that she
could now only ask his forgiveness, yet never forgive herself
for the wickedness she had so wilfully practised.</p>

<p>He stood listening in silence at first, then his faded eyes narrowed
with fury, and in his worn cheeks, under the rouge, a sickly colour
stained the flesh. The change in the man was frightful.</p>

<p>"D'ye mean to throw me over for that wood-running whelp, Cardigan?"
he burst out. "Oh no, my lady, that cock won't fight, d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>The startling coarseness of the outbreak brought Silver Heels
to her feet in frightened astonishment. Horror mantled throat
and cheeks with crimson; she shrank back, catching support on
a marble table beside her.</p>

<p>All over Dunmore's scowling visage the enamel was cracking; he
paced the carpet like one demented, chattering and scratching
at the air.</p>

<p>"I will not be so used! Curse me if I will!" he snarled, biting
his polished nails. "Hell's fury! madam; do you think to throw
me over for a hind of buckskin? Damn me if you shall!&mdash;and Lady
Shelton saw him kiss you on the knoll at that! Fine sport, madam!
Fine sport! So you think to make me the laughing-stock o' Virginia?
So you write letters to your buckskin lout and plan to run off
with him in a post-chaise&mdash;eh? Damned if you shall! Damned if
you do!"</p>

<p>"Pray&mdash;pray let me pass," gasped Silver Heels, choking with fright.</p>

<p>He caught the door in his hand, closing it, and planted himself
with his back against it. Then he fumbled behind him for the key,
but it was in the other side of the door.</p>

<p>"Oh no, not yet," he said.</p>

<p>"I must pass that door," repeated Silver Heels, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"By God, you shall not!" he cried. "You shall stay here all night,
d'ye hear? Ay, and folk shall hear of it and gossip, too, and
the whole world shall know how the Governor of Virginia bundled
to win a worthless wife! I tell you I mean to have you, and if
you wed me not fair you shall wed me compromised, and thank me,
too, for my name to cloak your shame withal!"</p>

<p>His voice ended in a shriek; the door behind him burst open,
flinging him forward, and Black Betty appeared, eyes ablaze and
teeth bared. The next instant Silver Heels sprang through the
portal, the door banged, and I heard the key turn on the other
side with a click.</p>

<p>Dumfounded, I looked stupidly through the window behind me, then
my heart leaped up, for there, at the foot of the garden, stood
a post-chaise and four, lamps lighted, and postilions sitting
their horses. There, too, were Silver Heels and Betty, setting
foot to the chaise step. Dark figures aided them, the chaise door
shut. I thanked God silently and turned to deal with these wicked
men whom He had given into my hands.</p>

<p>Dunmore, insane with fury, was clawing at the window to raise
it; Butler came swiftly from the ballroom and tried the door.
Finding it locked, he looked at Dunmore with a ghastly laugh.</p>

<p>"She's gone!" shrieked Dunmore. "Gone in a chaise! That black
slut of hers did it! Let me out! Let me out! I'll claw them raw!
I'll pinch them to death! I <em>won't</em> stay here, d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>His voice soared into a falsetto screech, and he tore at his
gums with his nails and stamped his feet.</p>

<p>"Give place there!" said Butler, brutally elbowing the frantic
man aside. "Let me through that window, you doddering fool! You're
done for; it's my turn now."</p>

<p>"What!" gasped Dunmore. Then terror blanched his face, and he
began to scream: "That was <em>your</em> chaise! You mean to cheat
me! You mean to steal her! That was your chaise, and it's gone!
No! No! Damme, you shall not catch them at the gates!" And he
flung himself on Butler to drag him from the open window.</p>

<p>"Drive on!" shouted Butler, leaning out and calling to the people
in the chaise.</p>

<p>Startled, I turned and stared through the window behind me. To
my horror the horses started and the chaise began to move off.
Even yet I did not comprehend that the chaise was not my own,
but to see it slowly rolling away in the night terrified me, and
I bounded out into the room&mdash;barely in time, for Butler had already
forced Dunmore from the open window and had laid his hand on the
wall to hoist himself out. Quick as the thought, I balanced my
heavy knife, hilt to palm, swung forward and let it fly like lightning.
The blade whistled true and struck, pinning Butler's arm to the
wall. God! how he shrieked and shrank, twisting and turning to
tear the blade loose. Dunmore ran around like a crazed rat, but
I knocked him senseless with a chair, and sprang at Butler, who,
writhing and ghastly pale, had just freed his left hand of the
knife. He ran at me with his sword, but I shattered my heavy chair
across his face, and seized him, meaning to cut his throat. Twist
and tear and clutch as he would, he could not escape or hurt me;
the coolness of murder was in my heart; I strangled him with one
hand and hunted around the floor for my knife. It was gone, I
could not find it. Then a wave of fury blazed in my brain; I lifted
the struggling wretch with both hands above my head and brought
him down on the floor, where he crashed as though every bone in
him were shattered to the marrow.</p>

<p>As I reeled, panting, towards the window, the key turned in the
locked door and Lady Shelton's frightened face appeared. When
she saw me she rushed at me and screamed, but I thrust the harridan
out of my path, vaulted through the open window, and ran down
the orchard slope. Then, as I sprang into the lane, I almost dropped,
for there, where I had left it, stood my post-chaise, awaiting
me.</p>

<p>"Mount!" I shouted in terror. "Is she here?"</p>

<p>"Here?" he cried. "You are mad! Have you lost her?"</p>

<p>Through my whirling senses the awful truth broke like a living
ray of fire.</p>

<p>"Out o' the saddle!" I shouted. "She has taken another chaise.
It's Butler's men! Ride for her! Ride!"</p>

<p>"Gone?" thundered Mount, leaping to the seat, while I sprang
to his vacant saddle. But I only lashed at the horses, and set
my teeth while the dust flew and the pebbles showered through
the flying wheels.</p>

<p>It seemed hours, yet it was scarcely five minutes, ere the gate-house
lights broke out ahead, dots of dim yellow dancing through the
dust. Now we were galloping straight into the eye of the great
brass lanthorn set above the guard-house; there came a far call
in the darkness, a shadow crossed the lamplit glare, then I turned
in my saddle and shouted: "Draw bridle!"&mdash;and our four horses
came clashing in a huddle with a hollow volley of hoof-beats.</p>

<p>"Road closed for the night!" said a sentinel, walking towards
us from the darkness ahead, cap, buckle, and buttons glittering
in the lamplight.</p>

<p>"A post-chaise passed five minutes ahead of us," began Mount,
angrily.</p>

<p>"Tut! tut! my good fellow," said the sentry; "that's none o'
your business. Back up there!"</p>

<p>"I wish to see Mr. Bevan," said I, scarce able to speak.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bevan's gone home to bed," said the soldier, impatiently.
"He passed that other post-chaise at a gallop, or it would have
been here yet, I warrant you. Come, come, now! You know the law.
Clear the road, now!&mdash;turn your leaders, post-boy&mdash;back up, d'ye
hear!"</p>

<p>"I tell you I've got to pass!" I persisted.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have, have you? And who are you, my important friend?"
he sneered, barring our way with firelock balanced.</p>

<p>"I am deputy of Sir William Johnson!" I roared, losing all self-control.
"Stand clear, there!"</p>

<p>"If you move I'll shoot!" he retorted; then without turning his
head he bawled out: "Ho, sergeant o' the quarter-guard! Post number
seven!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drive over him!" I shouted, lashing at the horses. There was
a jolt, an uproar, a rush of frantic horses, a bright flash and
report. Then a wheel caught the soldier and pitched him reeling
into the darkness. I turned in my stirrups, glancing fearfully
at Renard, who was recovering his balance in the saddle behind
me and lifting a firelock to the pommel.</p>

<p>"Shot?" I asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"No; I caught his firelock; it exploded in my hand."</p>

<p>"Look out!" called Mount, from his front seat on the chaise.
"The toll-gate's right ahead! There's a camp-guard due there at
midnight! Out with your coach-lamps!"</p>

<p>Shemuel jerked open each lanthorn and blew out the lights; darkness
hid even the horses from our sight.</p>

<p>A camp-guard! Suppose the gate was closed! Thirty men and a drummer
ahead of us!</p>

<p>"Cut the pike!" cried Mount, suddenly. "We save six miles by
the old Williamsburg post-road! Turn out! Turn out!"</p>

<p>Far ahead the toll-gate lamp twinkled through the dust; I signalled
to Renard and dragged the horses into a trot, straining my eyes
for the branch road we had seen that morning. I could see nothing.</p>

<p>"By Heaven! the guard is gone; there's only a sentry there!"
said Mount, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Pst!" muttered Renard. "We are the grand rounds, mind you. Answer,
Jack!"</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried a distant sentry. "Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"Grand rounds!" sang out Mount.</p>

<p>"Stand, grand rounds! Advance, sergeant, with the countersign!"
came the distant challenge again.</p>

<p>"Now," muttered Mount, leaping softly to the turf, "when I call,
ride up to me. Hark for a whippoorwill!"</p>

<p>He vanished in the darkness. I waited, scarcely breathing.</p>

<p>"He won't kill him," whispered the Weasel; "you will see, Mr.
Cardigan, how it's done. He'll get behind him&mdash;patience, patience&mdash;pst!&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>A stifled cry, suddenly choked, came out of the night; the lanthorn
at the toll-gate went out and the toll-house door slammed.</p>

<p>"It's the keeper barricading himself," whispered Renard; "he
thinks the sentry has been surprised and scalped. Hush! Mount
is calling."</p>

<p>"Whippoorwill! Whippoorwill!" throbbed the whimpering, breathless
call across the meadow; the Weasel answered it, and we trotted
on until a dark shape rose up in the road and caught at the leaders,
drawing them to a stand-still.</p>

<p>"'Nother firelock," said Mount, shoving the weapon into the chaise
and going back to the horses. "Here's the post-road; I'll guide
you into it." And he started east through a wall of shadow.</p>

<p>"Where's the sentry?" whispered Renard.</p>

<p>"In the ditch with his coat tied over his head and my new hanker
in his mouth. The frightened fool bit me so I scalped him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" cried the Weasel.</p>

<p>"Oh, only his wig. Here it is!" And he flung the wig at Renard,
who caught it and tossed it into the chaise for Shemuel.</p>

<p>Mount halted the horses; Shemuel struck flint to tinder, and
came around to light the coach-lamps. Under their kindling radiance
a dusty road spread away in front of us. Mount unlocked a lighted
coach-lamp and went forward, holding the light close to the road
surface. Several times he squatted to look close into the dust.</p>

<p>Presently he turned and ran back to us, set the lamp in its socket,
locked the clamp, and sprang into his seat. Shemuel hastily scrambled
into the chaise, stuffing the wig into his pocket.</p>

<p>"They've taken the turnpike!" cried Mount, cheerily. "Now, lads!
Whip and spur and axle-grease! Ride, Cade! Look sharp, Shemmy,
you weasel-bellied rascal! We've got them by half an hour, or
I'll eat my coon-skin cap!"</p>

<p>"Freshen all primings!" I called out to Shemuel, and sent my
whip whistling among the horses.</p>

<p>Away we bolted, chaise swaying, lamps sweeping the dusty roadside
bushes, and the gallop increased to a dead run as we whirled down
an incline and out along a broad, flat, marshy road, where the
jolting lamps flashed on the surface of a swift stream keeping
pace with us through the night.</p>

<p>"We catch them where the pike swings south into this road," called
Mount; but through the whistling wind I could barely hear him.
Louder and louder blew the wind across the flats, shrieking in
my ears; wetter and wetter grew the road, until the splash of
the horses grew to a churning, trampling roar. Like a flash the
stream turned across the road; the shallow water boiled under
our rush&mdash;a moment only&mdash;then into the wet road again, with the
stream scurrying on our right.</p>

<p>Through the pelting storm of mud I clutched bridle and whip with
one hand and pushed my pistol under my shirt with the other, calling
out to Renard to do the same.</p>

<p>"Get my axe loose from the boot, Shemmy!" cried Mount. "Draw
rein, Cade! Now, Mr. Cardigan!" And he leaped to the ground and
ran splashing through the road, calling out for us to follow at
a walk.</p>

<p>Suddenly our horses' hoofs sounded hollow on a wooden bridge;
the muddy planks glimmered under the coach-lamps, and, as he walked
the horses over, far below us we heard the dull roar of water
pouring through the solid rock. Now came the echoing cracks of
Mount's axe, biting the supports of the bridge, and presently
Shemuel joined him, chopping like a demon.</p>

<p>"We lose time!" I groaned, turning to the Weasel. "Call Mount
to let the bridge go."</p>

<p>"We'll lose time if the bridge stands," said Renard, coolly.
"Dunmore's horse will take our trail sooner or later, and we may
have to wait an hour for the chaise we are chasing."</p>

<p>Minute after minute dragged, timed by the interminable axe-strokes.
Presently the Weasel wriggled out of his saddle, ran to the boot,
and hurried away, axe on shoulder, and I sat there alone in the
lamplight, gnawing my lips and groaning.</p>

<p>But now, above the sharp axe-strokes and the deep roar of the
torrent, I caught the sound of creaking timbers. Crack! Crack!
Then a long-drawn crackle of settling beams, ending in a crash
which set the blowing horses on their hind legs. Ere I could pull
them down, Mount came running back, followed by Renard and Shemuel.</p>

<p>"No need to gallop now," observed Mount, shoving the axes into
the boot and brushing the mud from his face. He climbed into his
seat; Shemuel sought the body of the chaise, and Renard mounted
the horse behind me.</p>

<p>"Walk the horses," said Mount; "we are an hour ahead yet. The
roads cross just below here. Cheer up, Mr. Cardigan; we'll sight
them over our rifles yet. And when Dunmore's horsemen come to
the bridge yonder, they'll have some twenty miles to wander ere
they can cross the Monongahela to-night."</p>

<p>"The river is in flood; you can hear it," added Renard. "There's
no ford for twenty miles where a horse could live to-night."</p>

<p>"Lord! Won't Dunmore rage!" muttered Mount.</p>

<p>I had not thought of pursuit, but there was probably no doubt
that Dunmore's horse were already hunting our trail somewhere
between the stockade and the toll-gate. If that were so our plans
must be changed, for we could not traverse Virginia with the Governor's
dragoons at our heels.</p>

<p>Distracted with anxiety, cold and feverish by turns, I strove
to regain self-command, and in a measure succeeded. Mount was
of my opinion that we must take a forest road over the mountains
and make straight for Philadelphia&mdash;on foot, if our chaise could
not take us. He asked me about the Indians we might encounter,
and I told him we had nothing as yet to fear from the Lenape,
who could not be bound by clan ties to take up the Cayugas' quarrel
until the Mohawks rose.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mount, "curse them all, I say. One moccasin looks
like another, and all redskins smell like foxes. I take your word
for it that the Lenape are afraid to breathe unless the Mohawks
give them leave, so I hope we get through without a war-yelp in
our ears."</p>

<p>"There's the Tuscaroras," said Renard, gloomily.</p>

<p>It was true. In my misery and torturing fear for Silver Heels,
I had forgotten the Sixth Nation, bands of whom roamed the forests
north of the Virginia line. But reflection quieted apprehensions
concerning the Tuscaroras, who also must first take council with
our Mohawks before drawing their hatchets in a Cayuga quarrel.</p>

<p>I explained this to Mount, who swore a great deal and shrugged
his shoulders, but nevertheless I knew he was greatly relieved.</p>

<p>"There's a wood road over the mountains," he said. "Cade knows
it. He came that way hunting his wife at Annapolis when the British
fleet put in. Didn't you, Cade?"</p>

<p>The Weasel turned in his saddle.</p>

<p>"Jack," he said, gently, "I know my wife is dead. We will never
speak of her any more."</p>

<p>Mount was silent. Presently he jumped to the ground and came
walking along beside my horse, one hand on my stirrup.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he muttered, under his breath&mdash;"I don't know
whether that's a healthy sign or not. Ever since Cade saw your
lady &mdash;Miss Warren&mdash;he keeps telling me that his wife is
dead, and that God has forgiven her and has told him to do so,
too. Somehow he has changed. Do you note it? His voice, now, is
different&mdash;like a gentleman's. Somehow, he makes me feel lonely."</p>

<p>I was scarcely listening, for, just ahead, I fancied I could
see a signpost which must mark cross-roads. After a moment I called
excitedly to Mount, pointing out to him the tall post in the middle
of the road. Behind it the moon was setting.</p>

<p>"Ay," he said, coolly, "that's our runway. The game will cross
here in an hour or so. Sit your saddle, Mr. Cardigan; there's
time to whistle the devil's jig to an end yet."</p>

<p>But I was out of my saddle and priming my rifle afresh before
he could finish.</p>

<p>"Poor lad," he said, pityingly. "Lord, but you're white as a
cross-roads ghost. Shemmy, take the chaise south till you come
to a spring brook that crosses the road; it's a hundred yards
or so. Cover the coach-lamps with blankets and look to the horses
a bit. Cade, I guess you had better take this side of the road
with me. We want to be sure o' the post-boys. Mr. Cardigan, try
to shoot the driver through the head. There's too much risk in
a low shot."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, be careful!" I begged them. "Remember the lady
is in the chaise. Can't you kill the leading horses&mdash;wouldn't
that be safer?"</p>

<p>They were silent for a while. Presently Mount looked guiltily
at me, muttering something about "highwayman style," but Renard
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Well," began Mount, combatively, "it's the safest. I can stop
the chaise all alone without a shot fired if you wish."</p>

<p>He looked at me; there was a joyously evil light in his sparkling
eyes.</p>

<p>"This is familiar ground to me," he said, impudently. "Cade and
I stopped Sir Timerson Chank by that signpost."</p>

<p>After a moment he added: "Coach and six; post-boys, coachman,
footmen, and guards&mdash;all armed&mdash;eh, Cade, old spark? Lord, how
they gaped when I took off my hat and invited Sir Timerson to
a stroll! Do you mind that fat coachman, Cade?&mdash;and all the post-boys
agape and cross-eyed with looking into your rifle-barrel?"</p>

<p>"Jack," I groaned, "I cannot endure delay. Post us, for Heaven's
sake. I'm nigh spent with fright and grief."</p>

<p>"There, there!" said Mount, affectionately clapping me on the
shoulder. "You will see your dear lady in half an hour, lad. No
fear that we will miss&mdash;eh, Cade? We shoot straighter for our
friends' than for our own lives."</p>

<p>Then he bade the Weasel take his stand to the left, and posted
me to the right; he himself sat down cross-legged under the signpost&mdash;a
strange, monstrous shape squatting in the light of the setting
moon.</p>

<p>I heard the click, click, of the closing rifle-pans in the darkness,
and for the twentieth time I renewed my priming, fearing the night
air might flash the powder in the pan.</p>

<p>The silence weighed me down; awful fear shot through and through
me, stabbing my swelling heart till I quivered from head to toe.
Try as I might I could scarcely crush back the dread which sometimes
chained my limbs, sometimes set them trembling. Suppose that after
all they had gone north, risking the war-belt for a dash through
to Crown Gap? This was foolish, and I knew it, for they were bound
for Williamsburg. Yet the dreadful chance of their mistaking the
route and plunging into a Cayuga ambuscade drove me almost frantic.</p>

<p>I thought of Silver Heels, while straining my ears for the sound
of the chaise that bore her. Strange, but in my excitement I found
myself utterly unable to recall her face to mind. Other faces
crowded it out, and I could see them plainly, God wot! &mdash;Dunmore,
falling under my heavy blow; Butler, his ghastly visage shattered,
writhing with my clutch at his throat; Greathouse, as he lay in
the alley with the lanthorn's light on his bloated face&mdash;enough!
Ay, enough now, for in my ears I seemed to hear the crash of Butler's
bones as I had dashed his accursed body to the floor, and I trembled
and wondered what God did to punish those who had slain.</p>

<p>Punish? Perhaps this was my punishment now&mdash;perhaps I was never
to see Silver Heels again! Terrible thoughts gathered like devils
and clamoured at my ears for a hearing, and I lay on the wet grass,
listening and staring into the night, while my dry lips burnt
with the fever that consumed me. Around me the darkness seemed
to be rocking like water; my head swam as if invisible tides were
ebbing through it. Again and again I seemed to be falling, and
I started to find my eyes wide open and burning like fire.</p>

<p>Suddenly a faint, far sound in the night stilled every pulse.
I saw Mount slowly rise to his feet and step into the shadow of
the signpost. The whispering call of a whippoorwill broke out
from the bushes where Renard lurked, and I stood up, icy cold
but calm, eyes fixed on the darkness which engulfed the road ahead.</p>

<p>Again the distant sound broke out in the stillness; it came again,
clear and unmistakable. Now the noise of rapidly galloping horses
sounded plainly; wheels striking stones rang out sharp and clear;
two lights sparkled in the distance, growing yellower and bigger,
while the road beneath flashed into sight in the advancing radiance.</p>

<p>On, on they came, horses at a heavy gallop, chaise swinging and
lurching, right into the cross-roads. Then a blinding flash and
crash split the gloom, echoed by another, and then a third. I
leaped from my cover into a frantic mass of struggling horses
which Renard was dragging violently into the road-ditch, while
Mount, swinging his rifle, knocked down a man who fired at him
and beat him till he lay still.</p>

<p>A shadowy form leaped from the seat in front and ran across my
path, doubling and disappearing into the darkness; another slid
from his horse, sinking to the ground without a sound, though
the crazed animal kicked and trampled him into the mud.</p>

<p>As I sprang to the chaise, I saw the driver lurch towards me,
and I aimed a blow at him with my rifle, but he pitched off heavily,
landing in a heap at my feet, face downward in the grass. Now
the horses swung in front of me, plunging furiously in the smashed
harness; crash! went a wheel; the chaise sank forward; a horse
fell.</p>

<p>"Look out! Look out!" shouted Mount, behind me, as I ran to the
swaying vehicle.</p>

<p>"Silver Heels!" I cried, tearing at the door of the chaise.</p>

<p>For a second I saw her terrified face at the window; her cry
rang in my ears; then the door burst open and Wraxall sprang out,
burying his knife in my neck.</p>

<p>Down we went together, down, down into a smothering darkness
that had no end, yet I remember, after a long, long time, looking
up at the stars&mdash;or perhaps into her eyes.</p>

<p>Then my body seemed to sink again, silently as a feather, and
my soul dropped out, falling like a lost star into an endless
night.</p>
