<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The letter was written in the cramped hand of Brother Spencer. Through
its faulty diction ran a plainly discernible undernote of disapproval
for Samson, though there was no word of reproof or criticism. It was
plain that it was sent as a matter of courtesy to one who, having
proven an apostate, scarcely merited such consideration. It informed
him that old Spicer South had been "mighty porely," but was now better,
barring the breaking of age. Every one was "tolerable." Then came the
announcement which the letter had been written to convey.
</p>
<p>The term of the South-Hollman truce had ended, and it had been renewed
for an indefinite period.
</p><p>"Some of your folks thought they ought to let you know because they
promised to give you a say," wrote the informant. "But they decided
that it couldn't hardly make no difference to you, since you have left
the mountains, and if you cared anything about it, you knew the time,
and could of been here. Hoping this finds you well."
</p><p>Samson's face clouded. He threw the soiled and scribbled missive down
on the table and sat with unseeing eyes fixed on the studio wall. So,
they had cast him out of their councils! They already thought of him as
one who had been.
</p><p>In that passionate rush of feeling, everything that had happened since
he had left Misery seemed artificial and dream-like. He longed for the
realities that were forfeited. He wanted to press himself close to the
great, gray shoulders of rock that broke through the greenery like
giants tearing off soft raiment. Those were his people back there. He
should be running with the wolf-pack, not coursing with beagles.
</p><p>He had been telling himself that he was loyal, and now he realized
that he was drifting like the lotus-eaters. Things that had gripped his
soul were becoming myths. Nothing in his life was honest--he had become
as they had prophesied, a derelict. In that thorn-choked graveyard lay
the crude man whose knotted hand had rested on his head just before
death stiffened it bestowing a mission.
</p><p>"I hain't fergot ye, Pap." The words rang in his ears with the agony
of a repudiated vow.
</p><p>He rose and paced the floor, with teeth and hands clenched, and the
sweat standing out on his forehead. His advisers had of late been
urging him to go to Paris He had refused, and his unconfessed reason
had been that in Paris he could not answer a sudden call. He would go
back to them now, and compel them to admit his leadership.
</p><p>Then, his eyes fell on the unfinished portrait of Adrienne. The face
gazed at him with its grave sweetness; its fragrant subtlety and its
fine-grained delicacy. Her pictured lips were silently arguing for the
life he had found among strangers, and her victory would have been an
easy one, but for the fact that just now his conscience seemed to be on
the other side. Samson's civilization was two years old--a thin veneer
over a century of feudalism--and now the century was thundering its
call of blood bondage. But, as the man struggled over the dilemma, the
pendulum swung back. The hundred years had left, also, a heritage of
quickness and bitterness to resent injury and injustice. His own people
had cast him out. They had branded him as the deserter; they felt no
need of him or his counsel. Very well, let them have it so. His problem
had been settled for him. His Gordian knot was cut.
</p><p>Sally and his uncle alone had his address. This letter, casting him
out, must have been authorized by them, Brother Spencer acting merely
as amanuensis. They, too, had repudiated him--and, if that were true,
except for the graves of his parents the hills had no tie to hold him.
</p><p>"Sally, Sally!" he groaned, dropping his face on his crossed arms,
while his shoulders heaved in an agony of heart-break, and his words
came in the old crude syllables: "I 'lowed you'd believe in me ef hell
froze!" He rose after that, and made a fierce gesture with his clenched
fists. "All right," he said, bitterly, "I'm shet of the lot of ye. I'm
done!"
</p><p>But it was easier to say the words of repudiation than to cut the ties
that were knotted about his heart. Again, he saw Sally standing by the
old stile in the starlight with sweet, loyal eyes lifted to his own,
and again he heard her vow that, if he came back, she would be waiting.
Now, that picture lay beyond a sea which he could not recross. Sally
and his uncle had authorized his excommunication. There was, after all,
in the entire world no faith which could stand unalterable, and in all
the world no reward that could be a better thing than Dead-Sea fruit,
without the love of that barefooted girl back there in the log cabin,
whose sweet tongue could not fashion phrases except in illiteracy. He
would have gambled his soul on her steadfastness without fear--and he
bitterly told himself he would have lost. And yet--some voice sounded
to him as he stood there alone in the studio with the arteries knotted
on his temples and the blood running cold and bitter in his veins--and
yet what right had he, the deserter, to demand faith? One hand went up
and clasped his forehead--and the hand fell on the head that had been
shorn because a foreign woman had asked it. What tradition had he kept
inviolate? And, in his mood, that small matter of shortened hair meant
as great and bitter surrender as it had meant to the Samson before him,
whose mighty strength had gone out under the snipping of shears. What
course was open to him now, except that of following the precedent of
the other Samson, of pulling down the whole temple of his past? He was
disowned, and could not return. He would go ahead with the other life,
though at the moment he hated it.
</p><p>With a rankling soul, the mountaineer left New York. He wrote Sally a
brief note, telling her that he was going to cross the ocean, but his
hurt pride forbade his pleading for her confidence, or adding, "I love
you." He plunged into the art life of the "other side of the Seine,"
and worked voraciously. He was trying to learn much--and to forget much.
</p><p>One sunny afternoon, when Samson had been in the <u>Quartier Latin</u>
for eight or nine months, the <u>conci√®rge</u> of his lodgings handed
him, as he passed through the cour, an envelope addressed in the hand
of Adrienne Lescott. He thrust it into his pocket for a later reading
and hurried on to the <u>atelier</u> where he was to have a criticism
that day. When the day's work was over, he was leaning on the
embankment wall at the <u>Quai de Grand St. Augustin</u>, gazing idly
at the fruit and flower stands that patched the pavement with color and
at the gray walls of the Louvre across the Seine, His hand went into
his pocket, and came out with the note. As he read it, he felt a glow
of pleasurable surprise, and, wheeling, he retraced his steps briskly
to his lodgings, where he began to pack. Adrienne had written that she
and her mother and Wilfred Horton were sailing for Naples, and
commanded him, unless he were too busy, to meet their steamer. Within
two hours, he was bound for Lucerne to cross the Italian frontier by
the slate-blue waters of Lake Maggiore.
</p><p>A few weeks later Samson and Adrienne were standing together by
moonlight in the ruins of the Coliseum. The junketing about Italy had
been charming, and now, in that circle of sepia softness and broken
columns, he looked at her, and suddenly asked himself:
</p><p>"Just what does she mean to you?"
</p><p>If he had never asked himself that question before, he knew now that
it must some day be answered. Friendship had been a good and seemingly
a sufficient definition. Now, he was not so sure that it could remain so.
</p><p>Then, his thoughts went back to a cabin in the hills and a girl in
calico. He heard a voice like the voice of a song-bird saying through
tears:
</p><p>"I couldn't live without ye, Samson.... I jest couldn't do hit!"
</p><p>For a moment, he was sick of his life. It seemed that there stood
before him, in that place of historic wraiths and memories, a girl, her
eyes sad, but loyal and without reproof. For an instant, he could see a
scene of centuries ago. A barbarian and captive girl stood in the
arena, looking up with ignorant, but unflinching, eyes; and a man sat
in the marble tiers looking down. The benches were draped with
embroidered rugs and gold and scarlet hangings; the air was heavy with
incense--and blood. About him sat men and women of Rome's culture,
freshly perfumed from the baths. The slender figure in the dust of the
circus alone was a creature without artifice. And, as she looked up,
she recognized the man in the box, the man who had once been a
barbarian, too, and she turned her eyes to the iron gates of the cages
whence came the roar of the beasts, and waited the ordeal. And the face
was the face of Sally.
</p><p>"You look," said Adrienne, studying his countenance in the pallor of
the moonlight, "as though you were seeing ghosts."
</p><p>"I am," said Samson. "Let's go."
</p><p>Adrienne had not yet seen her portrait. Samson had needed a few hours
of finishing when he left New York, though it was work which could be
done away from the model. So, it was natural that, when the party
reached Paris, Adrienne should soon insist on crossing the <u>Pont d'
Alexandre III</u>. to his studio near the "<u>Boule Mich'</u>" for an
inspection of her commissioned canvas. For a while, she wandered about
the business-like place, littered with the gear of the painter's craft.
It was, in a way, a form of mind-reading, for Samson's brush was the
tongue of his soul.
</p><p>The girl's eyes grew thoughtful, as she saw that he still drew the
leering, saturnine face of Jim Asberry. He had not outgrown hate, then?
But she said nothing, until he brought out and set on an easel her own
portrait. For a moment, she gasped with sheer delight for the colorful
mastery of the technique, and she would have been hard to please had she
not been delighted with the conception of herself mirrored in the
canvas. It was a face through which the soul showed, and the soul was
strong and flawless. The girl's personality radiated from the canvas
--and yet--A disappointed little look crossed and clouded her eyes. She
was conscious of an indefinable catch of pain at her heart.
</p><p>Samson stepped forward, and his waiting eyes, too, were disappointed.
</p><p>"You don't like it, Drennie?" he anxiously questioned. But she smiled
in answer, and declared:
</p><p>"I love it."
</p><p>He went out a few minutes later to telephone for her to Mrs. Lescott,
and gave Adrienne <u>carte blanche</u> to browse among his portfolios
and stacked canvases until his return. In a few minutes, she discovered
one of those efforts which she called his "rebellious pictures."
</p><p>These were such things as he painted, using no model except memory
perhaps, not for the making of finished pictures, but merely to give
outlet to his feelings; an outlet which some men might have found in
talk.
</p><p>This particular canvas was roughly blocked in, and it was elementally
simple, but each brush stroke had been thrown against the surface with
the concentrated fire and energy of a blow, except the strokes that had
painted the face, and there the brush had seemed to kiss the canvas.
The picture showed a barefooted girl, standing, in barbaric simplicity
of dress, in the glare of the arena, while a gaunt lion crouched eying
her. Her head was lifted as though she were listening to faraway music.
In the eyes was indomitable courage. That canvas was at once a
declaration of love, and a <u>miserere</u>. Adrienne set it up beside
her own portrait, and, as she studied the two with her chin resting on
her gloved hand, her eyes cleared of questioning. Now, she knew what
she missed in her own more beautiful likeness. It had been painted with
all the admiration of the mind. This other had been dashed off straight
from the heart--and this other was Sally! She replaced the sketch where
she had found it, and Samson, returning, found her busy with little
sketches of the Seine.
</p><hr/>
<p>"Drennie," pleaded Wilfred Horton, as the two leaned on the deck rail
of the <u>Mauretania</u>, returning from Europe, "are you going to hold
me off indefinitely? I've served my seven years for Rachel, and thrown
in some extra time. Am I no nearer the goal?"
</p><p>The girl looked at the oily heave of the leaden and cheerless
Atlantic, and its somber tones found reflection in her eyes. She shook
her head.
</p><p>"I wish I knew," she said, wearily. Then, she added, vehemently: "I'm
not worth it, Wilfred. Let me go. Chuck me out of your life as a little
pig who can't read her own heart; who is too utterly selfish to decide
upon her own life."
</p><p>"Is it"--he put the question with foreboding--"that, after all, I was
a prophet? Have you--and South--wiped your feet on the doormat marked
'Platonic friendship'? Have you done that, Drennie?"
</p><p>She looked up into his eyes. Her own were wide and honest and very
full of pain.
</p><p>"No," she said; "we haven't done that, yet. I guess we won't.... I
think he'd rather stay outside, Wilfred. If I was sure I loved him, and
that he loved me, I'd feel like a cheat--there is the other girl to
think of.... And, besides, I'm not sure what I want myself.... But I'm
horribly afraid I'm going to end by losing you both."
</p><p>Horton stood silent. It was tea-time, and from below came the strains
of the ship's orchestra. A few ulster-muffled passengers gloomily paced
the deck.
</p><p>"You won't lose us both, Drennie," he said, steadily. "You may lose
your choice--but, if you find yourself able to fall back on
substitutes, I'll still be there, waiting."
</p><p>For once, he did not meet her scrutiny, or know of it. His own eyes
were fixed on the slow swing of heavy, gray-green waters. He was
smiling, but it is as a man smiles when he confronts despair, and
pretends that everything is quite all right. The girl looked at him
with a choke in her throat.
</p><p>"Wilfred," she said, laying her hand on his arm, "I'm not worth
worrying over. Really, I'm not. If Samson South proposed to me to-day,
I know that I should refuse him. I am not at all sure that I am the
least little bit in love with him. Only, don't you see I can't be quite
sure I'm not? It would be horrible if we all made a mistake. May I have
till Christmas to make up my mind for all time? I'll tell you then,
dear, if you care to wait."
</p><hr/>
<p>Tamarack Spicer sat on the top of a box car, swinging his legs over
the side. He was clad in overalls, and in the pockets of his breeches
reposed a bulging flask of red liquor, and an unbulging pay envelope.
Tamarack had been "railroading" for several months this time. He had
made a new record for sustained effort and industry, but now June was
beckoning him to the mountains with vagabond yearnings for freedom and
leisure. Many things invited his soul. Almost four years had passed
since Samson had left the mountains, and in four years a woman can
change her mind. Sally might, when they met on the road, greet him once
more as a kinsman, and agree to forget his faulty method of courtship.
This time, he would be more diplomatic. Yesterday, he had gone to the
boss, and "called for his time." To-day, he was paid off, and a free
lance.
</p><p>As he reflected on these matters, a fellow trainman came along the top
of the car, and sat down at Tamarack's side. This brakeman had also
been recruited from the mountains, though from another section--over
toward the Virginia line.
</p><p>"So yer quittin'?" observed the new-comer.
</p><p>Spicer nodded.
</p><p>"Goin' back thar on Misery?"
</p><p>Again, Tamarack answered with a jerk of his head.
</p><p>"I've been layin' off ter tell ye somethin', Tam'rack."
</p><p>"Cut her loose."
</p><p>"I laid over in Hixon last week, an' some fellers that used ter know
my mother's folks took me down in the cellar of Hollman's store, an'
give me some licker."
</p><p>"What of hit?"
</p><p>"They was talkin' 'bout you."
</p><p>"What did they say?"
</p><p>"I seen that they was enemies of yours, an' they wasn't in no good
humor, so, when they axed me ef I knowed ye, I 'lowed I didn't know
nothin' good about ye. I had ter cuss ye out, or git in trouble myself."
</p><p>Tamarack cursed the whole Hollman tribe, and his companion went on:
</p><p>"Jim Asberry was thar. He 'lowed they'd found out thet you'd done shot
Purvy thet time, an' he said"--the brakeman paused to add emphasis to
his conclusion--"thet the next time ye come home, he 'lowed ter git ye
plumb shore."
</p><p>Tamarack scowled.
</p><p>"Much obleeged," he replied.
</p><p>At Hixon, Tamarack Spicer strolled along the street toward the courthouse. 
He wished to be seen. So long as it was broad daylight, and he
displayed no hostility, he knew he was safe--and he had plans.
</p><p>Standing before the Hollman store were Jim Asberry and several
companions. They greeted Tamarack affably, and he paused to talk.
</p><p>"Ridin' over ter Misery?" inquired Asberry.
</p><p>"'Lowed I mout as well."
</p><p>"Mind ef I rides with ye es fur es Jesse's place?"
</p><p>"Plumb glad ter have company," drawled Tamarack,
</p><p>They chatted of many things, and traveled slowly, but, when they came
to those narrows where they could not ride stirrup to stirrup, each
jockeyed for the rear position, and the man who found himself forced
into the lead turned in his saddle and talked back over his shoulder,
with wary, though seemingly careless, eyes. Each knew the other was
bent on his murder.
</p><p>At Purvy's gate, Asberry waved farewell, and turned in. Tamarack rode
on, but shortly he hitched his horse in the concealment of a hollow,
walled with huge rocks, and disappeared into the laurel.
</p><p>He began climbing, in a crouched position, bringing each foot down
noiselessly, and pausing often to listen. Jim Asberry had not been
outwardly armed when he left Spicer. But, soon, the brakeman's
delicately attuned ears caught a sound that made him lie flat in the
lee of a great log, where he was masked in clumps of flowering
rhododendron. Presently, Asberry passed him, also walking cautiously,
but hurriedly, and cradling a Winchester rifle in the hollow of his
arm. Then, Tamarack knew that Asberry was taking this cut to head him
off, and waylay him in the gorge a mile away by road but a short
distance only over the hill. Spicer held his heavy revolver cocked in
his hand, but it was too near the Purvy house to risk a shot. He waited
a moment, and then, rising, went on noiselessly with a snarling grin,
stalking the man who was stalking him.
</p><p>Asberry found a place at the foot of a huge pine where the undergrowth
would cloak him. Twenty yards below ran the creek-bed road, returning
from its long horseshoe deviation. When he had taken his position, his
faded butternut clothing matched the earth as inconspicuously as a
quail matches dead leaves, and he settled himself to wait. Slowly and
with infinite caution, his intended victim stole down, guarding each
step, until he was in short and certain range, but, instead of being at
the front, he came from the back. He, also, lay flat on his stomach,
and raised the already cocked pistol. He steadied it in a two-handed
grip against a tree trunk, and trained it with deliberate care on a
point to the left of the other man's spine just below the shoulder
blades.
</p><p>Then, he pulled the trigger! He did not go down to inspect his work.
It was not necessary. The instantaneous fashion with which the head of
the ambuscader settled forward on its face told him all he wanted to
know. He slipped back to his horse, mounted and rode fast to the house
of Spicer South, demanding asylum.
</p><p>The next day came word that, if Tamarack Spicer would surrender and
stand trial, in a court dominated by the Hollmans, the truce would
continue. Otherwise, the "war was on."
</p><p>The Souths flung back this message:
</p><p>"Come and git him."
</p><p>But Hollman and Purvy, hypocritically clamoring for the sanctity of
the law, made no effort to come and "git him." They knew that Spicer
South's house was now a fortress, prepared for siege. They knew that
every trail thither was picketed. Also, they knew a better way. This
time, they had the color of the law on their side. The Circuit Judge,
through the Sheriff, asked for troops, and troops came. Their tents
dotted the river bank below the Hixon Bridge. A detail under a white
flag went out after Tamarack Spicer. The militia Captain in command,
who feared neither feudist nor death, was courteously received. He had
brains, and he assured them that he acted under orders which could not
be disobeyed. Unless they surrendered the prisoner, gatling guns would
follow. If necessary they would be dragged behind ox-teams. Many
militiamen might be killed, but for each of them the State had another.
If Spicer would surrender, the officer would guarantee him personal
protection, and, if it seemed necessary, a change of venue would secure
him trial in another circuit. For hours, the clan deliberated. For the
soldiers they felt no enmity. For the young Captain they felt an
instinctive liking. He was a man.
</p><p>Old Spicer South, restored to an echo of his former robustness by the
call of action, gave the clan's verdict.
</p><p>"Hit hain't the co'te we're skeered of. Ef this boy goes ter town, he
won't never git inter no co'te. He'll be murdered."
</p><p>The officer held out his hand.
</p><p>"As man to man," he said, "I pledge you my word that no one shall take
him except by process of law. I'm not working for the Hollmans, or the
Purvys. I know their breed,"
</p><p>For a space, old South looked into the soldier's eyes, and the soldier
looked back.
</p><p>"I'll take yore handshake on thet bargain," said the mountaineer,
gravely. "Tam'rack," he added, in a voice of finality, "ye've got ter
go."
</p><p>The officer had meant what he said. He marched his prisoner into Hixon
at the center of a hollow square, with muskets at the ready. And yet,
as the boy passed into the court-house yard, with a soldier rubbing
elbows on each side, a cleanly aimed shot sounded from somewhere. The
smokeless powder told no tale and with blue shirts and army hats
circling him, Tamarack fell and died.
</p><p>That afternoon, one of Hollman's henchmen was found lying in the road
with his lifeless face in the water of the creek. The next day, as old
Spicer South stood at the door of his cabin, a rifle barked from the
hillside, and he fell, shot through the left shoulder by a bullet
intended for his heart. All this while, the troops were helplessly
camped at Hixon. They had power and inclination to go out and get men,
but there was no man to get.
</p><p>The Hollmans had used the soldiers as far as they wished; they had
made them pull the chestnuts out of the fire and Tamarack Spicer out of
his stronghold. They now refused to swear out additional warrants.
</p><p>A detail had rushed into Hollman's store an instant after the shot
which killed Tamarack was fired. Except for a woman buying a card of
buttons, and a fair-haired clerk waiting on her, they found the
building empty.
</p><p>Back beyond, the hills were impenetrable, and answered no questions.
