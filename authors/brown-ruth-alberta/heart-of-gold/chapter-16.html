<p>Peace was on crutches! And her delight knew no bounds.</p>

<p>"Why, I didn't s'pose I'd ever really come to use them!" she
exclaimed in breathless wonder while the doctor was adjusting
the pads to her arms and showing her how to manage them.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you that some fine day you would be walking again?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"O, yes, but I thought that was just so I'd keep on hoping for
something which never could happen."</p>

<p>The doctor glanced in surprise over the brown head at the big
sister Gail, who was watching proceedings with interest, and his
lips formed the question, "Doesn't she know the whole truth?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not," Gail whispered back.</p>

<p>"Then let's not tell her. She will enjoy it more if she finds
it out herself."</p>

<p>Gail nodded brightly; and as the little sister hopped nimbly
out into the hallway, anxious to display her new accomplishment
to other patients and nurses, the two grown-ups fell into a confidential
chat, and Peace was for the moment forgotten. That just suited
the small maid, eager to try her wings by herself, and finding
that neither doctor nor sister followed her, she tapped her way
down the corridor to the broad stairway leading to the first floor,
and began a laborious descent, fearful every moment lest someone
should hear and prevent her from carrying out her daring plan.
But no one came to stop her, and with much resting and readjusting
of the awkward crutches, Peace managed to reach the bottom of
the flight without serious mishap.</p>

<p>"Mercy! but that's hard work!" she panted, pausing to get her
breath before resuming her journey. "Now where, I wonder? O, there's
the office. I'll go call on Miss Murch first. She hasn't been
up to see me for days. I guess she must be sick herself."</p>

<p>Softly, slowly, she tapped across the hallway to the office door,
but stopped on the threshold. The room was empty. That is, Miss
Murch was not there; but at the sound of her crutches, a coarsely
clad, uncouth giant rose from the dimmest corner and shuffled
toward her, twirling a greasy felt hat in his ham-like hands,
and looking decidedly ill at ease. For once Peace was at a loss
for a word of greeting, but stood with mouth open surveying him
much as if he had been an ogre, until finally he growled out,
"Well, d'you b'long to this shebang?"</p>

<p>"<em>Y&mdash;</em>yes."</p>

<p>"Well, where the deuce is the head mogul? I've been waiting here
'most an hour and not a soul has hove in sight. I came to see
about Essie Martin."</p>

<p>"Essie Martin!" Peace was awake at once. That was the name of
the little girl whom Miss Wayne had told her about long ago. "Where
is Essie Martin?"</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>"In this building?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"When did she come?"</p>

<p>"A fortnight ago."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with her?"</p>

<p>"Darned nonsense. The doctor calls it appendiceetis."</p>

<p>"Are you her father?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>He had turned so the light from a nearby window fell full upon
his face, and Peace deliberately surveyed him from head to heels;
then calmly, as if speaking to herself, she remarked, "Well, Miss
Wayne was right. You <em>do</em> look like a hog, don't you? Only
the hogs I know are some cleaner."</p>

<p>The man glared angrily at her, but being too thick-skinned to
take in the full meaning of the child's words, he caught only
the familiar name she had spoken. "Miss Wayne?" he bellowed. "A
nurse? Is she here?"</p>

<p>"No, but she was once. She took care of me. Has Essie still got
her doll?"</p>

<p>"Doll!" snarled the father savagely. "She can't think of nothing
else. The lazy jade!"</p>

<p>"I knew it, I knew it!" cried Peace, clapping her hands triumphantly.
"I told Miss Wayne that Essie and her mother were all right. 'Twas
just you that wanted that plug of tobacco. Why didn't Essie's
mother come, too?"</p>

<p>"She's dead."</p>

<p>"O!" Peace was staggered by his blunt, indifferent reply, but
before she could frame another question, Miss Murch appeared from
an inner office, at the same moment that Miss Keith stepped through
the doorway from behind them in search of her truant patient;
and Peace suffered herself to be led docilely away. So absorbed
was she in her new discovery that even her pleasure in her ability
to walk again was forgotten.</p>

<p>Dr. Shumway and Gail had disappeared when she reached her room,
and the nurse reported that they had gone motoring; but the fact
that they had neglected to invite her to accompany them failed
to bother her much. Her busy brain was seething with new schemes.
She must find Essie Martin and talk with her. Where was the head
nurse? <em>She</em> would know all about the case. There, Miss
Keith had gone to answer someone's bell. Peace clapped her hands
in silent glee, and making sure that the eagle-eyed nurse was
actually out of range, she hurriedly set out to find Miss Gee,
knowing full well that that kindly woman would be able to tell
her what she wanted most to learn.</p>

<p>The next day when Gail appeared, prepared for a storm of passionate
reproaches, Peace pounced upon her with the exclamation, "O, sister,
I've got the most questions to ask and the most things to tell!
It's been ages since I've seen you. I hardly know where to begin,&mdash;whether
to tell about Essie first, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is Essie?" laughed Gail, settling herself composedly for
the torrent of prattle that was sure to follow.</p>

<p>"Why, Essie Martin, the little girl which Miss Wayne told me
about,&mdash;the one she sent two dolls to. One got burned up, you
'member."</p>

<p>"O, yes. Well, what is the news about her?"</p>

<p>"She is here in the hospital. I met her father yesterday. Her
mother died three months ago, and Essie has been dreadful sick
with <em>appendage-itis</em>. It's cut out now, and she is going
to get well, but her father don't want her any more. She is only
a girl and it will be years before she's big enough to keep house.
So he means to put her in an <em>orphant</em> asylum,&mdash;<em>just
give her away</em>, Gail, for someone to adopt! Isn't it perfectly
heathenish?"</p>

<p>"But maybe she will be better off, dear, than she is now," Gail
answered gravely, recalling some of the sad incidents connected
with unfortunate Essie's brief history.</p>

<p>"That's what Miss Keith said when I was telling her about it,
but it seems dreadful for an own father to give away his only
little girl. I couldn't bear to think of her in a 'sylum, Gail,
for she is an awful sweet little thing. I've been in to see her,
and she looks lots like our Allee. So I asked Miss Gee if she
didn't s'pose Aunt Pen could make room for her at Oak Knoll, and
we've written to find out. How I'd like to see Miss Wayne again
and tell her that Essie does love her doll and that her mother
didn't want that tobacco. Essie don't want to go there&mdash;to the
'sylum, I mean,&mdash;but she doesn't want to go home, either. Don't
you think Oak Knoll would be a nice place for her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, and I am sure she would like it there, too. If
Aunt Pen can possibly find room for her, she will certainly do
so. I am glad Miss Gee has written already."</p>

<p>"So'm I. It will be nice to have Essie in Martindale where I
can go to see her sometimes. She is so nice. I know Allee will
like her, too. She brought her Christmas doll along when she came
to the hospital, and is wild to see Miss Wayne. The doll is dressed
ever so cute, and is just as clean as when she got it, in spite
of her father being such a hoggy-looking man. She must have had
hard work to keep it like that if the rest of the family are as
dirty as he is. Miss Wayne thought all the Martins wanted of her
was what presents they could get, but you see Essie really loves
her doll. She has named it Helen, after Miss Wayne. Why, there
she is, now. I've a good notion to holler to her." Peace, having
glanced casually down into the street below, suddenly started
up from her chair with a gleeful shout.</p>

<p>"Who?" demanded Gail, startled at the exclamation.</p>

<p>"Miss Wayne, of course. She is sitting in Dr. Race's auto, and
isn't in her uniform today, either. I wonder why. That is the
third time I have seen her riding with the doctor when she didn't
have on her white clothes. She can't have very many cases these
days, I guess. Aren't there any sick folks to take care of?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er &mdash;I think she is going to take care of the doctor
after this," laughed Gail, a conscious blush flooding her pretty
face.</p>

<p>"What doctor?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Race."</p>

<p>"Is <em>he</em> sick?"</p>

<p>"No. O, no. But Miss Wayne is soon to become his wife, my dear."</p>

<p>"His wife! Mercy sakes! Ain't that just my luck? O, dear!" wailed
the small sister in distress.</p>

<p>"Why, what in the world is the matter?" cried Gail in great surprise.
"I am sure that is a delightful sequel to a beautiful romance.
Dr. Race is such a good man as well as a wonderfully successful
physician, and Miss Wayne will make an ideal wife for him. Think
how happy they will be in a little home of their very own."</p>

<p>"That may all be so," Peace reluctantly admitted, "but what am
I going to do now for a pattern? She was an old maid&mdash;she said
so herself&mdash;and I'd made up my mind to be just like her; and here
she's going to be married after all. That's the way it happens
every time with me. I thought Miss Swift wanted Dr. Race for a
husband. The nurses used to joke about it all the time, and if
Miss Wayne was going to get married at all, I don't see why she
didn't pick out Dr. Dick. I like him best of all. O, I forgot
to tell you,&mdash;he broke his leg last night."</p>

<p>"Who?" Gail flew out of her chair like a ball from a cannon's
mouth.</p>

<p>"Dr. Dick."</p>

<p>"Peace Greenfield, what do you mean?" shrieked the older girl,
seizing the small sister by the shoulder with a grip that hurt.</p>

<p>"Ouch! Leggo! Don't you ever pinch me like that again! His automobile
ran into a telegraph pole when he tried to turn out so's he wouldn't
hit a baby playing in the street, and he fell out and broke his
leg. It's a wonder that he wasn't hurt <em>eternally</em>. They
brought him here and Dr. Kruger set it. My, but he's ugly! I've
been in to see him already this morning. I just <em>had</em> to
get even with him for the trick he played on me when I first came
here, so I told him that when he wanted to walk to remember he
would find four legs under his bed. But he never thought it a
bit funny. Doctors and nurses do make the meanest patients when
they are sick of anyone I know," concluded Peace sagely.</p>

<p>Gail had stood like one petrified as Peace chattered volubly
on, but now she found her voice and excitedly interrupted, "But
Dick &mdash;Dr. Shumway&mdash;where is he now? Why didn't anyone tell
me before?"</p>

<p>"He's in Room 10, down the hall,&mdash;though I don't see why <em>you</em>
should be told any sooner than&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Gail had vanished; and Peace, after one long, amazed look
after the fleeing form, grabbed her crutches and started in pursuit,
muttering as she hobbled along, "<em>I'm</em> going to see what's
the matter."</p>

<p>At the threshold of the doctor's room, however, she paused, transfixed
at the sight of Gail bending over the prostrate figure on the
narrow bed, kissing&mdash;yes, actually kissing&mdash;a pair of mustached
lips.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" she gasped, backing out precipitately.</p>

<p>But the lovers neither heard nor heeded.</p>

<p>"I thought you would <em>never</em> come!" the doctor was saying
fervently, while he held Gail fast in his arms. "Kruger promised
that he would 'phone you last night."</p>

<p>"I never knew a word about it until Peace told me a minute ago,"
Gail protested.</p>

<p>"What would we do without our Peace?" he murmured. Then discovering
the shocked face in the doorway, he exclaimed, "Why, here she
is herself! Hello, chicken!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you kissed her," Peace exploded. "<em>I saw you!</em>"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered brazenly, "and I am going to do it again."</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;have you gone and got married,&mdash;you two?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," he laughed boyishly. "But we are going to do just
that very thing as soon as I can coax her to set the day. You
don't mean to say that you object?"</p>

<p>"No &mdash;O, no. If she's got to have a husband, I don't know
of a better one than you, except St. John, and he is already married
once. But &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>am&mdash;surprised! Isn't she&mdash;er&mdash;rather
young?"</p>

<p>And she could not understand why they laughed.</p>
