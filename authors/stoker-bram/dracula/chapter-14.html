MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL
<P>
     23 September.--Jonathan is better  after a bad night. I
am so  glad that he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps
his mind off the terrible things, and oh, I am rejoiced that
he is not  now weighed  down  with the responsibility of his
new position.  I  knew he  would be true to himself, and now
how proud  I  am to see  my Jonathan rising to the height of
his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties
that come upon him.  He  will be away all day till late, for
he  said he  could not lunch at  home.  My household work is
done, so I shall take his  foreign  journal, and lock myself
up in my room and read it.
<P>

24 September.--I hadn't  the heart to write last night,
that terrible record of  Jonathan's upset me so.  Poor dear!
How he must have suffered,  whether it be true or only imagination.  I wonder if there is  any truth in it at all.  Did
he  get his  brain fever,  and then write all those terrible
things,  or had he some cause for it all?  I suppose I shall
never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.  And yet
that man we saw yesterday!  He seemed quite certain of  him,
poor fellow! I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent
his mind back on some train of thought.
<P>
     He believes it all himself. I remember how on our wedding day he said "Unless some solemn duty come upon me to  go
back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane . . ."
There seems to be through it all some thread of  continuity.
That fearful Count was coming  to London.  If it should  be,
and he came to London, with its teeming millions . . . There
may be a solemn duty, and if it come we must not shrink from
it. I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter this very
hour and begin transcribing.  Then we shall be ready for other
eyes if required.  And if it be wanted, then,  perhaps, if I
am ready, poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for
him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all.
If ever Jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want
to tell me of it all, and  I can ask him  questions and find
out things, and see how I may comfort him.

   LETTER, VAN HELSING TO MRS. HARKER
<P>

<P>
        24 September
<P>
        (Confidence)
<P>

"Dear Madam,
<P>
     "I pray  you  to pardon my writing, in that I am so far
friend as that I sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra's
death.  By the kindness of Lord Godalming, I am empowered to
read her letters and papers, for I am deeply concerned about
certain  matters  vitally  important.  In  them  I find some
letters from you, which show how great friends  you were and
how you love her.  Oh, Madam Mina, by that  love, I  implore
you, help me.  It is for others' good that I ask, to redress
great wrong, and to  lift much  and  terrible troubles, that
may  be  more great than you can know.  May it be that I see
you?  You  can trust me.  I am friend of Dr. John Seward and
of Lord Godalming  (that was  Arthur of Miss Lucy).  I  must
keep it private for the present  from all.  I should come to
Exeter to see you at  once if you  tell me I am privilege to
come, and where and when.  I implore  your pardon, Madam.  I
have read your  letters to  poor Lucy, and know how good you
are and how your husband suffer.  So  I  pray you, if it may
be, enlighten him not, least it may harm. Again your pardon,
and forgive me.
<P>
       "VAN HELSING"

    TELEGRAM, MRS. HARKER TO VAN HELSING
<P>

<P>
     25 September.--Come  today by quarter past ten train if
you can catch it.  Can see you any time you call.
 "WILHELMINA HARKER"
<P>

 MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL
<P>

<P>
     25 September.--I  cannot  help feeling terribly excited
as the time draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for
somehow  I  expect  that it will throw some light upon Jonathan's sad experience,  and as he attended poor dear Lucy in
her last illness, he can tell me all about her.  That is the
reason of his coming.  It  is concerning Lucy and her sleepwalking, and  not  about  Jonathan.  Then I shall never know
the real truth now!  How silly I am. That awful journal gets
hold of my imagination and tinges everything with  something
of its own color.  Of course it is about  Lucy.  That  habit
came back to the poor dear, and that awful night on the cliff
must have made her ill.  I had almost forgotten  in  my  own
affairs how ill she was afterwards.  She must  have told him
of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew
all about it, and now he wants me to tell him what I know, so
that he may understand.  I hope I did  right  in  not saying
anything of it to Mrs. Westenra.  I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even a negative one, brought
harm on poor dear Lucy.  I hope too, Dr. Van Helsing will not
blame me.  I have had so much  trouble  and anxiety of  late
that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.
<P>
     I suppose  a  cry does us all good at times, clears the
air as other  rain does.  Perhaps it was reading the journal
yesterday that  upset  me, and then  Jonathan went away this
morning to stay away from me a whole day and night, the first
time we have been parted since our marriage.  I do  hope the
dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will
occur to upset him.  It is two  o'clock, and the doctor will
be here soon now.  I shall say nothing of Jonathan's journal
unless he asks me.  I am so glad  I  have typewritten out my
own journal, so that, in case he asks about Lucy, I can hand
it to him.  It will save much questioning.
<P>
     Later.--He has come and gone.  Oh, what a strange meeting, and  how it all makes my head whirl round.  I feel like
one in a dream.  Can it be all possible, or even a part of it?
If I had  not read Jonathan's  journal first, I should never
have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear Jonathan!
How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may
not upset him again.  I shall  try to save him from it.  But
it may be even  a  consolation and  a  help to him, terrible
though it be and awful in its consequences, to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain  did not deceive  him,
and that it is all true.  It may be that it is the doubt which
haunts him, that when the doubt is removed, no matter which,
waking  or  dreaming, may prove  the  truth, he will be more
satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing
must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur's
friend and Dr. Seward's, and if they brought him all the way
from Holland to look after Lucy. I feel from having seen him
that he  is  good  and  kind and of a noble nature.  When he
comes  tomorrow  I shall  ask him about Jonathan.  And then,
please God, all this sorrow  and  anxiety may lead to a good
end.  I used to think I would like to practice interviewing.
Jonathan's friend on "The Exeter News"  told him that memory
is  everything  in  such work,  that you must be able to put
down  exactly almost every  word spoken, even if  you had to
refine some of it afterwards.  Here was a rare interview.  I
shall  try to record it verbatim.
<P>
     It  was  half-past  two o'clock when the knock came.  I
took my courage  a  deux mains and waited.  In a few minutes
Mary opened the door, and announced "Dr. Van Helsing".
<P>
     I rose and bowed, and he came towards me, a man of medium weight, strongly built, with his shoulders set back over
a broad, deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as
the head is on the neck. The poise of the head strikes me at
once as indicative of thought and power.  The head is noble,
well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears.  The face, cleanshaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large  resolute, mobile
mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but  with  quick,
sensitive nostrils, that seem  to broaden as  the  big bushy
brows come down and the mouth tightens.  The forehead is broad
and fine, rising at first almost straight  and  then sloping
back above two bumps or ridges wide apart, such  a  forehead
that the reddish hair cannot possibly  tumble  over it,  but
falls naturally back and to the sides.  Big, dark  blue eyes
are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with
the man's moods.  He said to me,
<P>
     "Mrs. Harker, is it not?"  I bowed assent.
<P>
     "That was Miss Mina Murray?"  Again I assented.
<P>
     "It  is  Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend
of that poor dear child Lucy Westenra.  Madam Mina, it is on
account of the dead that I come."
<P>
     "Sir,"  I  said,  "you could have no better claim on me
than that you were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra."And
I held out my hand.  He took it and said tenderly,
<P>
     "Oh,  Madam  Mina,  I know that the friend of that poor
little girl must be good, but I had yet to learn . . ."   He
finished his speech with a courtly bow.  I asked him what it
was that he wanted to see me about, so he at once began.
<P>
     "I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but
I had to begin to inquire somewhere, and  there  was none to
ask.  I know that you were with her at Whitby. She sometimes
kept a diary, you need not look surprised,  Madam  Mina.  It
was begun after you had left, and was  an  imitation of you,
and in that diary she traces by  inference certain things to
a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her.  In
great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your
so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember."
<P>
     "I  can  tell  you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about
it."
<P>
     "Ah,  then you have good memory for facts, for details?
It is not always so with young ladies."
<P>
     "No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can
show it to you if you like."
<P>
     "Oh, Madam Mina, I well be grateful.  You will do me much
favor."
<P>
     I could  not  resist the temptation of mystifying him a
bit,  I  suppose it is some taste of the original apple that
remains still  in  our mouths, so I handed him the shorthand
diary. He took it with a grateful bow, and said, "May I read
it?"
<P>
     "If  you  wish," I answered as demurely as I could.  He
opened it, and  for an instant his face fell.  Then he stood
up and bowed.
<P>
     "Oh, you so clever woman!"  he said.  "I knew long that
Mr. Jonathan  was  a  man of much thankfulness, but see, his
wife have all the good things.  And will you not so much honor
me and so help me as to read it  for  me?  Alas!  I know not
the shorthand."
<P>
     By this  time my little joke was over, and I was almost
ashamed.  So I took the typewritten copy from my work basket
and handed it to him.
<P>
     "Forgive me,"  I said.  "I could not help it, but I had
been thinking  that it  was of  dear Lucy that you wished to
ask, and so that you might not have  time to wait, not on my
account, but because  I  know  your time must be precious, I
have written it out on the typewriter for you."
<P>
     He took it and his  eyes glistened.  "You are so good,"
he said.  "And may I read it now? I may want to ask you some
things when I have read."
<P>
     "By all means,"  I  said.  "read it over whilst I order
lunch, and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat."
<P>
     He bowed and settled  himself  in a chair with his back
to the light, and became so absorbed in the papers, whilst I
went  to  see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not
be disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement.
He rushed up to me and took me by both hands.
<P>
     "Oh, Madam Mina," he said, "how can I say what I owe to
you?  This paper is as sunshine.  It opens the gate to me. I
am dazed,  I  am dazzled, with so much light, and yet clouds
roll  in  behind the light every time.  But that you do not,
cannot  comprehend.  Oh,  but  I  am grateful to you, you so
clever woman.  Madame," he said this very solemnly, "if ever
Abraham Van Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust
you will let me know.  It will be pleasure and  delight if I
may serve you as a friend, as a friend, but  all I have ever
learned, all I can ever do, shall be for  you  and those you
love.  There are darknesses in life, and  there  are lights.
You are one of the lights.  You will have a happy life and a
good life, and your husband will be  blessed in you."
<P>
     "But,  doctor,  you praise me too much,  and you do not
know me."
<P>
     "Not know you,  I, who am old, and who have studied all
my life  men  and  women,  I who  have made my specialty the
brain and all that belongs to  him  and all that follow from
him!  And  I  have read  your diary that  you have so goodly
written for me, and which breathes out  truth in every line.
I, who have read your so sweet letter to  poor Lucy  of your
marriage and your trust, not know you!  Oh, Madam Mina, good
women tell all their lives, and  by day and by hour  and  by
minute,  such things that angels can  read.  And  we men who
wish to know have  in  us  something of  angels' eyes.  Your
husband is  noble nature, and  you  are noble  too,  for you
trust, and trust cannot be where there is  mean nature.  And
your  husband, tell  me  of  him.  Is he quite well?  Is all
that fever gone, and is he strong and hearty?"
<P>
     I saw here  an  opening to ask him about Jonathan, so I
said,"He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset
by Mr. Hawkins death."
<P>
     He interrupted, "Oh, yes. I know.  I know.  I have read
your last two letters."
<P>
     I went on,  "I suppose this upset him, for when we were
in town on Thursday last he had a sort of shock."
<P>
     "A shock,  and after  brain fever so soon!  That is not
good.  What kind of shock was it?"
<P>
     "He  thought  he  saw  some one who  recalled something
terrible, something which led to his brain fever."  And here
the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me  in a rush.  The pity
for Jonathan,  the  horror  which he  experienced, the whole
fearful mystery  of his  diary, and  the  fear that has been
brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose
I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up
my  hands  to  him, and implored him to make my husband well
again.  He took  my hands  and raised me up, and made me sit
on the sofa, and sat by me. He held my hand in his, and said
to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness,
<P>
     "My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work
that I  have  not had much time for friendships, but since I
have been  summoned  to here by my friend John Seward I have
known so many good people and seen such nobility that I feel
more than  ever,  and  it has grown with my advancing years,
the  loneliness of my life.  Believe  me,  then, that I come
here full  of  respect  for you, and you have given me hope,
hope, not in what I am seeking  of,  but that there are good
women still left to make life happy, good women, whose lives
and whose truths may make good lesson for the children  that
are to be.  I am glad, glad, that I may here be  of some use
to you.  For if  your husband suffer,  he suffer within  the
range of my study and experience.  I promise you that I will
gladly do all for him that I can, all to make his life strong
and manly, and your life a happy one. Now  you must eat. You
are over-wrought and perhaps over-anxious.  Husband Jonathan
would not like to see you so pale, and what he like not where
he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must
eat and smile.  You have told me about  Lucy,  and so now we
shall not speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter tonight, for I want to think much  over  what  you have
told me, and when I have thought I will ask you questions, if
I may.  And then too, you will tell me of husband Jonathan's
trouble so far as you can, but not yet.  You  must  eat now,
afterwards you shall tell me all."
<P>
     After lunch,  when we went back to the drawing room, he
said to me, "And now tell me all about him."
<P>
     When it came  to  speaking to this great learned man, I
began to fear that he would  think me a weak fool, and Jonathan a madman, that journal is  all  so strange, and I hesitated to  go  on.  But  he was so sweet and kind, and he had
promised to help, and I trusted him, so I said,
<P>
     "Dr. Van Helsing,  what  I have to tell you is so queer
that you must not laugh at me or at my husband.  I have been
since  yesterday  in  a sort of fever of doubt.  You must be
kind to me, and not think  me  foolish that I have even half
believed some very strange things."
<P>
     He reassured me by his manner as well as his words when
he said, "Oh, my dear, if  you  only know how strange is the
matter regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh.
I have learned not to think  little  of any one's belief, no
matter how strange it may be.  I have  tried to keep an open
mind, and it is not the ordinary things of  life that  could
close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary  things,
the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane."
<P>
     "Thank you, thank you a thousand times!  You have taken
a weight off my mind.  If you will let me, I shall  give you
a paper to read.  It is long, but I have typewritten it out.
It will tell you my trouble and Jonathan's.  It is the copy of
his journal when abroad, and all that  happened.  I dare not
say anything of it.  You will read  for  yourself and judge.
And then when I see you, perhaps, you will  be very kind and
tell me what you think."
<P>
     "I promise," he said as I gave him the papers. "I shall
in the morning, as  soon as  I can, come to see you and your
husband, if I may."
<P>
     "Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must
come to lunch with us and see him then.  You could catch the
quick 3:34 train, which will leave you at Paddington  before
eight."  He was surprised at my knowledge of the trains offhand, but he does not know that I have made up all the trains
to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in case he is
in a hurry.
<P>
     So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit
here thinking, thinking I don't know what.

LETTER (by hand), VAN HELSING TO MRS. HARKER
<P>

<P>
       25 September, 6 o'clock
<P>

"Dear Madam Mina,
<P>
     "I have read your husband's so wonderful diary. You may
sleep without doubt.  Strange and terrible as it  is, it  is
true! I will pledge my life on it.  It may be worse for others,
but for him and you there is no dread.  He is a noble fellow,
and let  me  tell  you  from experience of men, that one who
would do as he did in going down that wall and to that room,
aye, and going  a  second  time, is not one to be injured in
permanence by a shock.  His brain and his heart are all right,
this I swear, before I have even seen him, so be at rest.  I
shall have much to ask him of other things.  I am blessed that
today I come to see you, for I have learn all at once so much
that again I am  dazzled, dazzled more than ever, and I must
think.
<P>
     "Yours the most faithful,
<P>
     "Abraham Van Helsing."
<P>

<P>
     LETTER, MRS. HARKER TO VAN HELSING
<P>

<P>
       25 September, 6:30 p.  m.
<P>

"My dear Dr. Van Helsing,
<P>
     "A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken
a great  weight off  my  mind.  And yet, if it be true, what
terrible things there  are  in the  world, and what an awful
thing if that man, that monster, be really in London! I fear
to think.  I have this moment, whilst writing,  had  a  wire
from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 tonight from
Launceston and will be here at 10:18,so that I shall have no
fear tonight.  Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with
us, please come to breakfast at eight o'clock, if this be not
too early for you?  You can get away, if you are in a hurry,
by the 10:30 train, which  will bring you  to  Paddington by
2:35.  Do not answer this, as  I shall take it that, if I do
not hear, you will come to breakfast.
<P>
     "Believe me,
<P>
     "Your faithful and grateful friend,
<P>
     "Mina Harker."
<P>

<P>
         JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL
<P>

<P>
     26 September.--I  thought never  to write in this diary
again, but the  time has come.  When  I  got home last night
Mina had supper ready, and when we had supped she told me of
Van Helsing's  visit, and  of  her having given him the  two
diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been about me.
She showed me in the doctor's letter that all  I  wrote down
was true.  It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the
doubt as to the reality of the whole  thing  that knocked me
over. I felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful. But,
now that I know, I am not afraid, even of the Count.  He has
succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting to London, and it was he I saw.  He  has got younger, and how?  Van
Helsing is the man  to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is
anything like  what Mina  says.  We  sat late, and talked it
over.  Mina is dressing, and I shall call  at the hotel in a
few minutes and bring him over.
<P>

<P>
     He was, I think, surprised to see me.  When I came into
the room whee he was, and introduced myself,  he  took me by
the shoulder,  and  turned  my face  round to the light, and
said, after a sharp scrutiny,
<P>
     "But Madam Mina told me  you were ill, that you had had
a shock."
<P>
     It was so funny to hear my wife called  `Madam Mina' by
this kindly, strong-faced old man.  I smiled,  and  said, "I
was ill, I have had a shock, but you have cured me already."
<P>
     "And how?"
<P>
     "By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and
then everything took a hue of unreality, and  I did not know
what to trust, even the evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know what to do, and so had only
to keep on working in what had hitherto been  the  groove of
my life.  The  groove ceased  to  avail me, and I mistrusted
myself.  Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything,
even  yourself.  No,  you don't, you  couldn't with eyebrows
like yours."
<P>
     He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said, "So! You are
a physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with
so  much  pleasure coming to you to breakfast, and, oh, sir,
you  will pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed
in your wife."
<P>
     I would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so
I simply nodded and stood silent.
<P>
     "She is one of God's women, fashioned by His own hand to
show us men and other women that  there is a heaven where we
can enter, and that its light can be here on earth. So true,
so sweet, so  noble, so little an egoist,  and that,  let me
tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and selfish. And
you, sir. . . I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,
and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days
from the knowing of others, but  I  have seen your true self
since last night.  You will give me your hand, will you not?
And let us be friends for all our lives."
<P>
     We shook hands, and he was so  earnest and so kind that
it made me quite choky.
<P>
     "and now," he said,  "may I ask you for some more help?
I have  a  great  task to do,  and at the beginning it is to
know.  You can help me here.  Can  you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania?  Later  on  I may ask  more
help, and of a different kind, but at first this will do."
<P>
     "Look  here,  Sir,"  I said,  "does what you have to do
concern the Count?"
<P>
     "It does," he said solemnly."
<P>
     "Then  I  am with you heart and soul.  As you go by the
10:30 train,  you  will  not  have  time to read them, but I
shall get the bundle of papers.  You can take them with  you
and read them in the train."
<P>
     After breakfast I saw him to the station.  When we were
parting  he  said,  "Perhaps you will come to town if I send
for you, and take Madam Mina too."
<P>
     "We shall both come when you will," I said.
<P>
     I had got him  the morning papers and the London papers
of the  previous  night,  and  while  we were talking at the
carriage window, waiting for the train to start, he was turning them over.  His eyes suddenly seemed to catch  something
in one of them, "The Westminster Gazette", I knew it  by the
color, and he grew quite white.  He read something intently,
groaning to himself, "Mein Gott!  Mein Gott!  So  soon!   So
soon!"  I do not think he remembered me at the moment.  Just
then the whistle blew, and the train moved off.  This recalled
him to himself, and he leaned out of the  window  and  waved
his hand, calling out, "Love to Madam Mina. I shall write so
soon as ever I can."
<P>

 DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
<P>

<P>
     26 September.--Truly there is no such thing as finality.
Not a week since I said  "Finis," and yet here I am starting
fresh again, or rather going on with the record.  Until this
afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done.  Renfield
had become, to all intents, as  sane as he ever was.  He was
already well  ahead  with his  fly business, and he had just
started in the spider  line  also, so he had not been of any
trouble to me.  I had a letter  from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I gather that he  is bearing up wonderfully
well.  Quincey  Morris  is  with  him, and that is much of a
help,  for  he  himself is a  bubbling well of good spirits.
Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthur
is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy, so as
to them all my mind is at rest.  As for myself, I was  settling down to my work  with  the enthusiasm  which I used  to
have for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound
which poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised.
<P>
     Everything is, however, now reopened, and what is to be
the end  God  only  knows.  I have  an idea that Van Helsing
thinks  he  knows, too, but he will only let out enough at a
time to whet curiosity.  He  went  to  Exeter yesterday, and
stayed  there all  night.  Today he  came back,  and  almost
bounded into the room  at about  half-past five o'clock, and
thrust last night's "Westminster Gazette" into my hand.
<P>
     "What do you think of that?"  he asked as he stood back
and folded his arms.
<P>
     I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what
he meant, but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph
about children being  decoyed away at Hampstead.  It did not
convey much  to  me, until I reached a passage where it described small puncture wounds on their throats.  An idea struck
me, and I looked up.
<P>
     "Well?" he said.
<P>
     "It is like poor Lucy's."
<P>
     "And what do you make of it?"
<P>
     "Simply  that  there is some cause in common.  Whatever
it was that injured her  has injured them."  I did not quite
understand his answer.
<P>
     "That is true indirectly, but not directly."
<P>
     "How do you mean, Professor?"  I asked.  I was a little
inclined to take  his  seriousness lightly, for,  after all,
four days of rest and freedom from burning, harrowing,  anxiety does help to restore one's spirits, but when  I saw his
face, it sobered me.  Never, even in  the midst  of our despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.
<P>
     "Tell me!" I said.  "I can hazard no opinion.  I do not
know what to think, and I have  no  data on which to found a
conjecture."
<P>
     "Do you mean to tell me,  friend John, that you have no
suspicion  as  to what  poor Lucy died of, not after all the
hints given, not only by events, but by me?"
<P>
     "Of nervous prostration following a great loss or waste
of blood."
<P>
     "And how was the blood lost or wasted?" I shook my head.
<P>
     He stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on,"You
are a clever man, friend John.  You reason well, and your wit
is bold, but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes
see nor your ears hear, and that which is outside  your daily
life is not of account to you.  Do  you not think that  there
are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are,that
some people see things  that others  cannot?  But  there  are
things  old  and  new which must not be contemplated by men's
eyes, because they know, or think they know, some things which
other men have told them.  Ah, it is the fault of our science
that it wants to explain all, and  if it explain not, then it
says there is nothing to explain.  But  yet  we see around us
every day the growth of new beliefs,  which think  themselves
new, and which are yet but the old, which pretend to be young,
like the fine ladies at the opera.  I  suppose now you do not
believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialization.
No? Nor in astral bodies. No?  Nor in the  reading of thought.
No? Nor in hypnotism . . ."
<P>
     "Yes," I said.  "Charcot has proved that pretty well."
<P>
     He  smiled  as he went on, "Then you are satisfied as to
it.  Yes?  And of  course then you understand how it act, and
can follow the mind of  the great Charcot, alas that he is no
more, into the very soul of the patient that he influence.  No?
Then, friend John, am I to take it that you simply accept fact,
and are  satisfied  to  let  from  premise to conclusion be a
blank?  No?  Then tell me, for I am a student  of  the brain,
how you accept hypnotism and reject the thought reading.  Let
me tell you, my friend, that there  are things done  today in
electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the
very man who discovered electricity, who would themselves not
so long before been burned as wizards.  There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that Methuselah lived nine hundred
years, and `Old Parr'one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that
poor Lucy, with four men's blood in her poor veins, could not
live  even one day?  For, had she live one more day, we could
save her.  Do you know all the mystery of life and death?  Do
you know the  altogether  of  comparative anatomy and can say
wherefore the qualities of brutes  are  in  some men, and not
in others?  Can you tell me why, when other spiders die small
and  soon, that  one great spider lived  for centuries in the
tower of the old Spanish church and  grew and grew,  till, on
descending, he could drink  the oil of  all the church lamps?
Can you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are
bats that come out at night and open the veins  of cattle and
horses and suck dry their veins, how in some  islands  of the
Western seas there are bats which hang on  the trees all day,
and those who have seen describe as  like giant nuts or pods,
and that when the sailors  sleep on the deck, because that it
is hot, flit down on them and  then,  and then in the morning
are found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?"
<P>
     "Good  God,  Professor!"  I said,  starting up.  "Do you
mean to tell me that Lucy was bitten by such a bat, and  that
such a thing is here in London in the nineteenth century?"
<P>
     He waved his hand for silence, and went on,"Can you tell
me why the tortoise lives more long than generations  of men,
why the elephant goes on and on till he have sees  dynasties,
and why the parrot never die only of bite  of cat of  dog  or
other complaint?  Can you tell me why men believe in all ages
and places that there are men and women who cannot  die?   We
all know, because science has vouched for the fact, that there
have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years, shut
in one so small hole that only hold him since  the  youth  of
the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die and have been buried, and  his  grave  sealed and
corn sowed on it, and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and
reaped and cut again, and then men come and take away the unbroken seal  and  that there lie the Indian  fakir, not dead,
but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?"
<P>
     Here I interrupted him.  I  was  getting bewildered.  He
so crowded on my mind his list of nature's eccentricities and
possible  impossibilities  that  my  imagination  was getting
fired.  I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson,
as long ago  he used to do in his study at Amsterdam.  But he
used them to tell  me the thing, so that I could have the object of  thought in mind all the time.  But now I was without
his help, yet I wanted to follow him, so I said,
<P>
     "Professor,  let  me be your pet student again.  Tell me
the thesis, so that  I may apply your knowledge as you go on.
At present I  am  going  in my  mind from point to point as a
madman, and not a sane one, follows  an  idea.  I feel like a
novice lumbering through  a  bog in a midst, jumping from one
tussock to another in the mere  blind effort to move on without knowing where I am going."
<P>
     "That is  a  good image,"  he said.  "Well, I shall tell
you.  My thesis is this, I want you to believe."
<P>
     "To believe what?"
<P>
     "To believe in things that you cannot.  Let me illustrate.
I heard once of an American who so defined faith,  `that fac ulty which enables us to believe things  which  we know to be
untrue.'  For one, I follow that man.  He meant that we shall
have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the
rush of the big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck.
We  get  the  small truth  first.  Good!  We keep him, and we
value him, but all the same we must not let him think himself
all the truth in the universe."
<P>
     "Then  you  want me not  to let some previous conviction
inure the receptivity of my mind with  regard to some strange
matter.  Do I read your lesson aright?"
<P>
     "Ah, you are  my  favorite  pupil still.  It is worth to
teach you.  Now that you are willing  to understand, you have
taken the first  step  to  understand.  You  think  then that
those so small holes in  the children's throats  were made by
the same that made the holes in Miss Lucy?"
<P>
     "I suppose so."
<P>
     He stood up and said solemnly,  "Then you are wrong. Oh,
would it were so! But alas! No. It is worse, far, far worse."
<P>
     "In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?"
I cried.
<P>
     He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair,
and placed  his  elbows  on the table, covering his face with
his hands as he spoke.
<P>
     "They were made by Miss Lucy!"
