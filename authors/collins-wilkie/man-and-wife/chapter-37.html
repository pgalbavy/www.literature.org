<P>
BREAKFAST was just over. Blanche, seeing a pleasantly-idle
morning before her, proposed to Arnold to take a stroll in the
grounds.
<P>
The garden was blight with sunshine, and the bride was bright
with good-humor. She caught her uncle's eye, looking at her
admiringly, and paid him a little compliment in return. "You have
no idea," she said, "how nice it is to be back at Ham Farm!"
<P>
"I am to understand then," rejoined Sir Patrick, "that I am
forgiven for interrupting the honey-moon?"
<P>
"You are more than forgiven for interrupting it," said
Blanche--"you are thanked. As a married woman," she proceeded,
with the air of a matron of at least twenty years' standing, "I
have been thinking the subject over; and I have arrived at the
conclusion that a honey-moon which takes the form of a tour on
the Continent, is one of our national abuses which stands in need
of reform. When you are in love with each other (consider a
marriage without love to be no marriage at all), what do you want
with the excitement of seeing strange places? Isn't it excitement
enough, and isn't it strange enough, to a newly-married woman to
see such a total novelty as a husband? What is the most
interesting object on the face of creation to a man in Arnold's
position? The Alps? Certainly not! The most interesting object is
the wife. And the proper time for a bridal tour is the time--say
ten or a dozen years later--when you are beginning (not to get
tired of each other, that's out of the question) but to get a
little too well used to each other. Then take your tour to
Switzerland--and you give the Alps a chance. A succession of
honey-moon trips, in the autumn of married life--there is my
proposal for an improvement on the present state of things! Come
into the garden, Arnold; and let us calculate how long it will be
before we get weary of each other, and want the beauties of
nature to keep us company."
<P>
Arnold looked appealingly to Sir Patrick. Not a word had passed
between them, as yet, on the se rious subject of Anne Silvester's
letter. Sir Patrick undertook the responsibility of making the
necessary excuses to Blanche.
<P>
"Forgive me," he said, "if I ask leave to interfere with your
monopoly of Arnold for a little while. I have something to say to
him about his property in Scotland. Will you leave him with me,
if I promise to release him as soon as possible?"
<P>
Blanche smiled graciously. "You shall have him as long as you
like, uncle. There's your hat," she added, tossing it to her
husband, gayly. "I brought it in for you when I got my own. You
will find me on the lawn."
<P>
She nodded, and went out.
<P>
"Let me hear the worst at once, Sir Patrick," Arnold began. "Is
it serious? Do you think I am to blame?"
<P>
"I will answer your last question first," said Sir Patrick. "Do I
think you are to blame? Yes--in this way. You committed an act of
unpardonable rashness when you consented to go, as Geoffrey
Delamayn's messenger, to Miss Silvester at the inn. Having once
placed yourself in that false position, you could hardly have
acted, afterward, otherwise than you did. You could not be
expected to know the Scotch law. And, as an honorable man, you
were bound to keep a secret confided to you, in which the
reputation of a woman was concerned. Your first and last error in
this matter, was the fatal error of involving yourself in
responsibilities which belonged exclusively to another man."
<P>
"The man had saved my life." pleaded Arnold--"and I believed I
was giving service for service to my dearest friend."
<P>
"As to your other question," proceeded Sir Patrick. "Do I
consider your position to be a serious one? Most assuredly, I do!
So long as we are not absolutely certain that Blanche is your
lawful wife, the position is more than serious: it is
unendurable. I maintain the opinion, mind, out of which (thanks
to your honorable silence) that scoundrel Delamayn contrived to
cheat me. I told him, what I now tell you--that your sayings and
doings at Craig Fernie, do _not_ constitute a marriage, according
to Scottish law. But," pursued Sir Patrick, holding up a warning
forefinger at Arnold, "you have read it in Miss Silvester's
letter, and you may now take it also as a result of my
experience, that no individual opinion, in a matter of this kind,
is to be relied on. Of two lawyers, consulted by Miss Silvester
at Glasgow, one draws a directly opposite conclusion to mine, and
decides that you and she are married. I believe him to be wrong,
but in our situation, we have no other choice than to boldly
encounter the view of the case which he represents. In plain
English, we must begin by looking the worst in the face."
<P>
Arnold twisted the traveling hat which Blanche had thrown to him,
nervously, in both hands. "Supposing the worst comes to the
worst," he asked, "what will happen?"
<P>
Sir Patrick shook his head.
<P>
"It is not easy to tell you," he said, "without entering into the
legal aspect of the case. I shall only puzzle you if I do that.
Suppose we look at the matter in its social bearings--I mean, as
it may possibly affect you and Blanche, and your unborn
children?"
<P>
Arnold gave the hat a tighter twist than ever. "I never thought
of the children," he said, with a look of consternation.
<P>
"The children may present themselves," returned Sir Patrick,
dryly, "for all that. Now listen. It may have occurred to your
mind that the plain way out of our present dilemma is for you and
Miss Silvester, respectively, to affirm what we know to be the
truth--namely, that you never had the slightest intention of
marrying each other. Beware of founding any hopes on any such
remedy as that! If you reckon on it, you reckon without Geoffrey
Delamayn. He is interested, remember, in proving you and Miss
Silvester to be man and wife. Circumstances may arise--I won't
waste time in guessing at what they may be--which will enable a
third person to produce the landlady and the waiter at Craig
Fernie in evidence against you--and to assert that your
declaration and Miss Silvester's declaration are the result of
collusion between you two. Don't start! Such things have happened
before now. Miss Silvester is poor; and Blanche is rich. You may
be made to stand in the awkward position of a man who is denying
his marriage with a poor woman, in order to establish his
marriage with an heiress: Miss Silvester presumably aiding the
fraud, with two strong interests of her own as inducements--the
interest of asserting the claim to be the wife of a man of rank,
and the interest of earning her reward in money for resigning you
to Blanche. There is a case which a scoundrel might set up--and
with some appearance of truth too--in a court of justice!"
<P>
"Surely, the law wouldn't allow him to do that?"
<P>
"The law will argue any thing, with any body who will pay the law
for the use of its brains and its time. Let that view of the
matter alone now. Delamayn can set the case going, if he likes,
without applying to any lawyer to help him. He has only to cause
a report to reach Blanche's ears which publicly asserts that she
is not your lawful wife. With her temper, do you suppose she
would leave us a minute's peace till the matter was cleared up?
Or take it the other way. Comfort yourself, if you will, with the
idea that this affair will trouble nobody in the present. How are
we to know it may not turn up in the future under circumstances
which may place the legitimacy of your children in doubt? We have
a man to deal with who sticks at nothing. We have a state of the
law which can only be described as one scandalous uncertainty
from beginning to end. And we have two people (Bishopriggs and
Mrs. Inchbare) who can, and will, speak to what took place
between you and Anne Silvester at the inn. For Blanche's sake,
and for the sake of your unborn children, we must face this
matter on the spot--and settle it at once and forever. The
question before us now is this. Shall we open the proceedings by
communicating with Miss Silvester or not?"
<P>
<P>
<P>
At that important point in the conversation they were interrupted
by the reappearance of Blanche. Had she, by any accident, heard
what they had been saying?
<P>
No; it was the old story of most interruptions. Idleness that
considers nothing, had come to look at Industry that bears every
thing. It is a law of nature, apparently, that the people in this
world who have nothing to do can not support the sight of an
uninterrupted occupation in the hands of their neighbors. Blanche
produced a new specimen from Arnold's collection of hats. "I have
been thinking about it in the garden," she said, quite seriously.
"Here is the brown one with the high crown. You look better in
this than in the white one with the low crown. I have come to
change them, that's all." She changed the hats with Arnold, and
went on, without the faintest suspicion that she was in the way.
"Wear the brown one when you come out--and come soon, dear. I
won't stay an instant longer, uncle--I wouldn't interrupt you for
the world." She kissed her hand to Sir Patrick, and smiled at her
husband, and went out.
<P>
<P>
<P>
"What were we saying?" asked Arnold. "It's awkward to be
interrupted in this way, isn't it?"
<P>
"If I know any thing of female human nature," returned Sir
Patrick, composedly, "your wife will be in and out of the room,
in that way, the whole morning. I give her ten minutes, Arnold,
before she changes her mind again on the serious and weighty
subject of the white hat and the brown. These little
interruptions--otherwise quite charming--raised a doubt in my
mind. Wouldn't it be wise (I ask myself), if we made a virtue of
necessity, and took Blanche into the conversation? What do you
say to calling her back and telling her the truth?"
<P>
Arnold started, and changed color.
<P>
"There are difficulties in the way," he said.
<P>
"My good fellow! at every step of this business there are
difficulties in the way. Sooner or later, your wife must know
what has happened. The time for telling her is, no doubt, a
matter for your decision, not mine. All I say is this. Consider
whether the disclosure won't come from you with a better grace,
if you make it before you are fairly driven to the wall, and
obliged to open your lips."
<P>
Arnold rose to his fee t--took a turn in the room--sat down
again--and looked at Sir Patrick, with the expression of a
thoroughly bewildered and thoroughly helpless man.
<P>
"I don't know what to do," he said. "It beats me altogether. The
truth is, Sir Patrick, I was fairly forced, at Craig Fernie, into
deceiving Blanche--in what might seem to her a very unfeeling,
and a very unpardonable way."
<P>
"That sounds awkward! What do you mean?"
<P>
"I'll try and tell you. You remember when you went to the inn to
see Miss Silvester? Well, being there privately at the time, of
course I was obliged to keep out of your way."
<P>
"I see! And, when Blanche came afterward, you were obliged to
hide from Blanche, exactly as you had hidden from me?"
<P>
"Worse even than that! A day or two later, Blanche took me into
her confidence. She spoke to me of her visit to the inn, as if I
was a perfect stranger to the circumstances. She told me to my
face, Sir Patrick, of the invisible man who had kept so strangely
out of her way--without the faintest suspicion that I was the
man. And I never opened my lips to set her right! I was obliged
to be silent, or I must have betrayed Miss Silvester. What will
Blanche think of me, if I tell her now? That's the question!"
<P>
Blanche's name had barely passed her husband's lips before
Blanche herself verified Sir Patrick's prediction, by reappearing
at the open French window, with the superseded white hat in her
hand.
<P>
"Haven't you done yet!" she exclaimed. "I am shocked, uncle, to
interrupt you again--but these horrid hats of Arnold's are
beginning to weigh upon my mind. On reconsideration, I think the
white hat with the low crown is the most becoming of the two.
Change again, dear. Yes! the brown hat is hideous. There's a
beggar at the gate. Before I go quite distracted, I shall give
him the brown hat, and have done with the difficulty in that
manner. Am I very much in the way of business? I'm afraid I must
appear restless? Indeed, I _am_ restless. I can't imagine what is
the matter with me this morning."
<P>
"I can tell you," said Sir Patrick, in his gravest and dryest
manner. "You are suffering, Blanche, from a malady which is
exceedingly common among the young ladies of England. As a
disease it is quite incurable--and the name of it is
Nothing-to-Do."
<P>
Blanche dropped her uncle a smart little courtesy. "You might
have told me I was in the way in fewer words than that." She
whisked round, kicked the disgraced brown hat out into the
veranda before her, and left the two gentlemen alone once more.
<P>
<P>
<P>
"Your position with your wife, Arnold," resumed Sir Patrick,
returning gravely to the matter in hand, "is certainly a
difficult one." He paused, thinking of the evening when he and
Blanche had illustrated the vagueness of Mrs. Inchbare's
description of the man at the inn, by citing Arnold himself as
being one of the hundreds of innocent people who answered to it!
"Perhaps," he added, "the situation is even more difficult than
you suppose. It would have been certainly easier for _you_--and
it would have looked more honorable in _her_ estimation--if you
had made the inevitable confession before your marriage. I am, in
some degree, answerable for your not having done this--as well as
for the far more serious dilemma with Miss Silvester in which you
now stand. If I had not innocently hastened your marriage with
Blanche, Miss Silvester's admirable letter would have reached us
in ample time to prevent mischief. It's useless to dwell on that
now. Cheer up, Arnold! I am bound to show you the way out of the
labyrinth, no matter what the difficulties may be--and, please
God, I will do it!"
<P>
He pointed to a table at the other end of the room, on which
writing materials were placed. "I hate moving the moment I have
had my breakfast," he said. "We won't go into the library. Bring
me the pen and ink here."
<P>
"Are you going to write to Miss Silvester?"
<P>
"That is the question before us which we have not settled yet.
Before I decide, I want to be in possession of the facts--down to
the smallest detail of what took place between you and Miss
Silvester at the inn. There is only one way of getting at those
facts. I am going to examine you as if I had you before me in the
witness-box in court."
<P>
With that preface, and with Arnold's letter from Baden in his
hand as a brief to speak from, Sir Patrick put his questions in
clear and endless succession; and Arnold patiently and faithfully
answered them all.
<P>
The examination proceeded uninterruptedly until it had reached
that point in the progress of events at which Anne had crushed
Geoffrey Delamayn's letter in her hand, and had thrown it from
her indignantly to the other end of the room. There, for the
first time, Sir Patrick dipped his pen in the ink, apparently
intending to take a note. "Be very careful here," he said; "I
want to know every thing that you can tell me about that letter."
<P>
"The letter is lost," said Arnold.
<P>
"The letter has been stolen by Bishopriggs," returned Sir
Patrick, "and is in the possession of Bishopriggs at this
moment."
<P>
"Why, you know more about it than I do!" exclaimed Arnold.
<P>
"I sincerely hope not. I don't know what was inside the letter.
Do you?"
<P>
"Yes. Part of it at least."
<P>
"Part of it?"
<P>
"There were two letters written, on the same sheet of paper,"
said Arnold. "One of them was written by Geoffrey Delamayn--and
that is the one I know about."
<P>
Sir Patrick started. His face brightened; he made a hasty note.
"Go on," he said, eagerly. "How came the letters to be written on
the same sheet? Explain that!"
<P>
Arnold explained that Geoffrey, in the absence of any thing else
to write his excuses on to Anne, had written to her on the fourth
or blank page of a letter which had been addressed to him by Anne
herself.
<P>
"Did you read that letter?" asked Sir Patrick.
<P>
"I might have read it if I had liked."
<P>
"And you didn't read it?"
<P>
"No."
<P>
"Why?"
<P>
"Out of delicacy."
<P>
Even Sir Patrick's carefully trained temper was not proof against
this. "That is the most misplaced act of delicacy I ever heard of
in my life!" cried the old gentleman, warmly. "Never mind! it's
useless to regret it now. At any rate, you read Delamayn's answer
to Miss Silvester's letter?"
<P>
"Yes--I did."
<P>
"Repeat it--as nearly as you can remember at this distance of
time."
<P>
"It was so short," said Arnold, "that there is hardly any thing
to repeat. As well as I remember, Geoffrey said he was called
away to London by his father's illness. He told Miss Silvester to
stop where she was; and he referred her to me, as messenger.
That's all I recollect of it now."
<P>
"Cudgel your brains, my good fellow! this is very important. Did
he make no allusion to his engagement to marry Miss Silvester at
Craig Fernie? Didn't he try to pacify her by an apology of some
sort?"
<P>
The question roused Arnold's memory to make another effort.
<P>
"Yes," he answered. "Geoffrey said something about being true to
his engagement, or keeping his promise or words to that effect."
<P>
"You're sure of what you say now?"
<P>
"I am certain of it."
<P>
Sir Patrick made another note.
<P>
"Was the letter signed?" he asked, when he had done.
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"And dated?"
<P>
"Yes." Arnold's memory made a second effort, after he had given
his second affirmative answer. "Wait a little," he said. "I
remember something else about the letter. It was not only dated.
The time of day at which it was written was put as well."
<P>
"How came he to do that?"
<P>
"I suggested it. The letter was so short I felt ashamed to
deliver it as it stood. I told him to put the time--so as to show
her that he was obliged to write in a hurry. He put the time when
the train started; and (I think) the time when the letter was
written as well."
<P>
"And you delivered that letter to Miss Silvester, with your own
hand, as soon as you saw her at the inn?"
<P>
"I did."
<P>
Sir Patrick made a third note, and pushed the paper away from him
with an air of supreme satisfaction.
<P>
"I always suspected that lost letter to be an important
document," he said--"or Bishopriggs would never have stolen it.
We must get possession of it, Arnold, at any sacrifice. The first
thing to be done (exactly as I anticipated), is to write to the
Glasgow lawyer, and find Miss Silvester."
<P>
<P>
<P>
"Wait a lit tle!" cried a voice at the veranda. "Don't forget
that I have come back from Baden to help you!"
<P>
Sir Patrick and Arnold both looked up. This time Blanche had
heard the last words that had passed between them. She sat down
at the table by Sir Patrick's side, and laid her hand caressingly
on his shoulder.
<P>
"You are quite right, uncle," she said. "I _am_ suffering this
morning from the malady of having nothing to do. Are you going to
write to Anne? Don't. Let me write instead."
<P>
Sir Patrick declined to resign the pen.
<P>
"The person who knows Miss Silvester's address," he said, "is a
lawyer in Glasgow. I am going to write to the lawyer. When he
sends us word where she is--then, Blanche, will be the time to
employ your good offices in winning back your friend."
<P>
He drew the writing materials once more with in his reach, and,
suspending the remainder of Arnold's examination for the present,
began his letter to Mr. Crum.
<P>
Blanche pleaded hard for an occupation of some sort. "Can nobody
give me something to do?" she asked. "Glasgow is such a long way
off, and waiting is such weary work. Don't sit there staring at
me, Arnold! Can't you suggest something?"
<P>
Arnold, for once, displayed an unexpected readiness of resource.
<P>
"If you want to write," he said, "you owe Lady Lundie a letter.
It's three days since you heard from her--and you haven't
answered her yet."
<P>
Sir Patrick paused, and looked up quickly from his writing-desk.
<P>
"Lady Lundie?" he muttered, inquiringly.
<P>
"Yes," said Blanche. "It's quite true; I owe her a letter. And of
course I ought to tell her we have come back to England. She will
be finely provoked when she hears why!"
<P>
The prospect of provoking Lady Lundie seemed to rouse Blanche s
dormant energies. She took a sheet of her uncle's note-paper, and
began writing her answer then and there.
<P>
Sir Patrick completed his communication to the lawyer--after a
look at Blanche, which expressed any thing rather than approval
of her present employment. Having placed his completed note in
the postbag, he silently signed to Arnold to follow him into the
garden. They went out together, leaving Blanche absorbed over her
letter to her step-mother.
<P>
"Is my wife doing any thing wrong?" asked Arnold, who had noticed
the look which Sir Patrick had cast on Blanche.
<P>
"Your wife is making mischief as fast as her fingers can spread
it."
<P>
Arnold stared. "She must answer Lady Lundie's letter," he said.
<P>
"Unquestionably."
<P>
"And she must tell Lady Lundie we have come back."
<P>
"I don't deny it."
<P>
"Then what is the objection to her writing?"
<P>
Sir Patrick took a pinch of snuff--and pointed with his ivory
cane to the bees humming busily about the flower-beds in the
sunshine of the autumn morning.
<P>
"I'll show you the objection," he said. "Suppose Blanche told one
of those inveterately intrusive insects that the honey in the
flowers happens, through an unexpected accident, to have come to
an end--do you think he would take the statement for granted? No.
He would plunge head-foremost into the nearest flower, and
investigate it for himself."
<P>
"Well?" said Arnold.
<P>
"Well--there is Blanche in the breakfast-room telling Lady Lundie
that the bridal tour happens, through an unexpected accident, to
have come to an end. Do you think Lady Lundie is the sort of
person to take the statement for granted? Nothing of the sort!
Lady Lundie, like the bee, will insist on investigating for
herself. How it will end, if she discovers the truth--and what
new complications she may not introduce into a matter which,
Heaven knows, is complicated enough already--I leave you to
imagine. _My_ poor powers of prevision are not equal to it."
<P>
Before Arnold could answer, Blanche joined them from the
breakfast-room.
<P>
"I've done it," she said. "It was an awkward letter to write--and
it's a comfort to have it over."
<P>
"You have done it, my dear," remarked Sir Patrick, quietly. "And
it may be a comfort. But it's not over."
<P>
"What do you mean?"
<P>
"I think, Blanche, we shall hear from your step-mother by return
of post."
