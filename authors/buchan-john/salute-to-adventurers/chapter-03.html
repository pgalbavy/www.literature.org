<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>"Never daunton youth" was, I remember, a saying of my grandmother's;
but it was the most dauntoned youth in Scotland that now jogged
over the moor to the Edinburgh highroad. I had a swimming head,
and a hard crupper to grate my ribs at every movement, and my
captor would shift me about with as little gentleness as if I
had been a bag of oats for his horse's feed. But it was the ignominy
of the business that kept me on the brink of tears. First, I was
believed to be one of the maniac company of the Sweet-Singers,
whom my soul abhorred; <em>item</em>, I had been worsted by a
trooper with shameful ease, so that my manhood cried out against
me. Lastly, I had cut the sorriest figure in the eyes of that
proud girl. For a moment I had been bold, and fancied myself her
saviour, but all I had got by it was her mocking laughter.</p>

<p>They took us down from the hill to the highroad a little north
of Linton village, where I was dumped on the ground, my legs untied,
and my hands strapped to a stirrup leather. The women were given
a country cart to ride in, and the men, including Muckle John,
had to run each by a trooper's leg. The girl on the sorrel had
gone, and so had the maid Janet, for I could not see her among
the dishevelled wretches in the cart. The thought of that girl
filled me with bitter animosity. She must have known that I was
none of Gib's company, for had I not risked my life at the muzzle
of his pistol? I had taken her part as bravely as I knew how,
but she had left me to be dragged to Edinburgh without a word.
Women had never come much my way, but I had a boy's distrust of
the sex; and as I plodded along the highroad, with every now and
then a cuff from a trooper's fist to cheer me, I had hard thoughts
of their heartlessness.</p>

<p>We were a pitiful company as, in the bright autumn sun, we came
in by the village of Liberton, to where the reek of Edinburgh
rose straight into the windless weather. The women in the cart
kept up a continual lamenting, and Muckle John, who walked between
two dragoons with his hands tied to the saddle of each, so that
he looked like a crucified malefactor, polluted the air with hideous
profanities. He cursed everything in nature and beyond it, and
no amount of clouts on the head would stem the torrent. Sometimes
he would fall to howling like a wolf, and folk ran to their cottage
doors to see the portent. Groups of children followed us from
every wayside clachan, so that we gave great entertainment to
the dwellers in Lothian that day. The thing infuriated the dragoons,
for it made them a laughing-stock, and the sins of Gib were visited
upon the more silent prisoners. We were hurried along at a cruel
pace, so that I had often to run to avoid the dragging at my wrists,
and behind us bumped the cart full of wailful women. I was sick
from fatigue and lack of food, and the South Port of Edinburgh
was a welcome sight to me. Welcome, and yet shameful, for I feared
at any moment to see the face of a companion in the jeering crowd
that lined the causeway. I thought miserably of my pleasant lodgings
in the Bow, where my landlady, Mistress Macvittie, would be looking
at the boxes the Lanark carrier had brought, and be wondering
what had become of their master. I saw no light for myself in
the business. My father's ill-repute with the Government would
tell heavily in my disfavour, and it was beyond doubt that I had
assaulted a dragoon. There was nothing before me but the plantations
or a long spell in some noisome prison.</p>

<p>The women were sent to the House of Correction to be whipped
and dismissed, for there was little against them but foolishness;
all except one, a virago called Isobel Bone, who was herded with
the men. The Canongate Tolbooth was our portion, the darkest and
foulest of the city prisons; and presently I found myself forced
through a gateway and up a narrow staircase, into a little chamber
in which a score of beings were already penned. A small unglazed
window with iron bars high up on one wall gave us such light and
air as was going, but the place reeked with human breathing, and
smelled as rank as a kennel. I have a delicate nose, and I could
not but believe on my entrance that an hour of such a hole would
be the death of me. Soon the darkness came, and we were given
a tallow dip in a horn lantern hung on a nail to light us to food.
Such food I had never dreamed of. There was a big iron basin of
some kind of broth, made, as I judged, from offal, from which
we drank in pannikins; and with it were hunks of mildewed rye-bread.
One mouthful sickened me, and I preferred to fast. The behaviour
of the other prisoners was most seemly, but not so that of my
company. They scrambled for the stuff like pigs round a trough,
and the woman Isobel threatened with her nails any one who would
prevent her. I was black ashamed to enter prison with such a crew,
and withdrew myself as far distant as the chamber allowed me.</p>

<p>I had no better task than to look round me at those who had tenanted
the place before our coming. There were three women, decent-looking
bodies, who talked low in whispers and knitted. The men were mostly
countryfolk, culled, as I could tell by their speech, from the
west country, whose only fault, no doubt, was that they had attended
some field-preaching. One old man, a minister by his dress, sat
apart on a stone bench, and with closed eyes communed with himself.
I ventured to address him, for in that horrid place he had a welcome
air of sobriety and sense.</p>

<p>He asked me for my story, and when he heard it looked curiously
at Muckle John, who was now reciting gibberish in a corner.</p>

<p>"So that is the man Gib," he said musingly. "I have heard tell
of him, for he was a thorn in the flesh of blessed Mr. Cargill.
Often have I heard him repeat how he went to Gib in the moors
to reason with him in the Lord's name, and got nothing but a mouthful
of devilish blasphemies. He is without doubt a child of Belial,
as much as any proud persecutor. Woe is the Kirk, when her foes
shall be of her own household, for it is with the words of the
Gospel that he seeks to overthrow the Gospel work. And how is
it with you, my son? Do you seek to add your testimony to the
sweet savour which now ascends from moors, mosses, peat-bogs,
closes, kennels, prisons, dungeons, ay, and scaffolds in this
distressed land of Scotland? You have not told me your name."</p>

<p>When he heard it he asked for my father, whom he had known in
old days at Edinburgh College. Then he inquired into my religious
condition with so much fatherly consideration that I could take
no offence, but told him honestly that I was little of a partisan,
finding it hard enough to keep my own feet from temptation without
judging others. "I am weary," I said, "of all covenants and resolutions
and excommunications and the constraining of men's conscience
either by Government or sectaries. Some day, and I pray that it
may be soon, both sides will be dead of their wounds, and there
will arise in Scotland men who will preach peace and tolerance,
and heal the grievously irritated sores of this land."</p>

<p>He sighed as he heard me. "I fear you are still far from grace,
lad," he said. "You are shaping for a Laodicean, of whom there
are many in these latter times. I do not know. It may be that
God wills that the Laodiceans have their day, for the fires of
our noble covenant have flamed too smokily. Yet those fires die
not, and sometime they will kindle up, purified and strengthened,
and will burn the trash and stubble and warm God's feckless people."</p>

<p>He was so old and gentle that I had no heart for disputation,
and could only beseech his blessing. This he gave me and turned
once more to his devotions. I was very weary, my head was splitting
with the foul air of the place, and I would fain have got me to
sleep. Some dirty straw had been laid round the walls of the room
for the prisoners to lie on, and I found a neuk close by the minister's
side.</p>

<p>But sleep was impossible, for Muckle John got another fit of
cursing He stood up by the door with his eyes blazing like a wild-cat's,
and delivered what he called his "testimony." His voice had been
used to shout orders on shipboard, and not one of us could stop
his ears against it. Never have I heard such a medley of profane
nonsense. He cursed the man Charles Stuart, and every councillor
by name; he cursed the Persecutors, from his Highness of York
down to one Welch of Borrowstoneness, who had been the means of
his first imprisonment; he cursed the indulged and tolerated ministers;
and he cursed every man of the hill-folk whose name he could remember.
He testified against all dues and cesses, against all customs
and excises, taxes and burdens; against beer and ale and wines
and tobacco; against mumming and peep-shows and dancing, and every
sort of play; against Christmas and Easter and Pentecost and Hogmanay.
Then most nobly did he embark on theology. He made short work
of hell and shorter work of heaven. He raved against idolaters
of the Kirk and of the Bible, and against all preachers who, by
his way of it, had perverted the Word. As he went on, I began
to fancy that Muckle John's true place was with the Mussulmans,
for he left not a stick of Christianity behind him.</p>

<p>Such blasphemy on the open hill-side had been shocking enough,
but in that narrow room it was too horrid to be borne. The minister
stuck his fingers in his ears, and, advancing to the maniac, bade
him be silent before God should blast him. But what could his
thin old voice do against Gib's bellowing? The mariner went on
undisturbed, and gave the old man a blow with his foot which sent
him staggering to the floor.</p>

<p>The thing had become too much for my temper. I cried on the other
men to help me, but none stirred, for Gib seemed to cast an unholy
spell on ordinary folk. But my anger and discomfort banished all
fear, and I rushed at the prophet in a whirlwind. He had no eyes
for my coming till my head took him fairly in the middle, and
drove the breath out of his chest. That quieted his noise, and
he turned on me with something like wholesome human wrath in his
face.</p>

<p>Now, I was no match for this great being with my ungrown strength,
but the lesson of my encounter with the dragoon was burned on
my mind, and I was determined to keep out of grips with him. I
was light on my feet, and in our country bouts had often worsted
a heavier antagonist by my quickness in movement. So when Muckle
John leaped to grab me, I darted under his arm, and he staggered
half-way across the room. The women scuttled into a corner, all
but the besom Isobel, who made clutches at my coat.</p>

<p>Crying "The sword of the Lord and of Gideon," Gib made a great
lunge at me with his fist. But the sword of Gideon missed its
aim, and skinned its knuckles on the stone wall. I saw now to
my great comfort that the man was beside himself with fury, and
was swinging his arms wildly like a flail. Three or four times
I avoided his rushes, noting with satisfaction that one of the
countrymen had got hold of the shrieking Isobel. Then my chance
came, for as he lunged I struck from the side with all my force
on his jaw. I am left-handed, and the blow was unlocked for. He
staggered back a step, and I deftly tripped him up, so that he
fell with a crash on the hard floor.</p>

<p>In a second I was on the top of him, shouting to the others to
lend me a hand. This they did at last, and so mazed was he with
the fall, being a mighty heavy man, that he scarcely resisted.
"If you want a quiet night," I cried, "we must silence this mountebank."
With three leathern belts, one my own and two borrowed, we made
fast his feet and arms, I stuffed a kerchief into his mouth, and
bound his jaws with another, but not so tight as to hinder his
breathing. Then we rolled him into a corner where he lay peacefully
making the sound of a milch cow chewing her cud. I returned to
my quarters by the minister's side, and presently from utter weariness
fell into an uneasy sleep.</p>

<p>I woke in the morning greatly refreshed for all the closeness
of the air, and, the memory of the night's events returning, was
much concerned as to the future. I could not be fighting with
Muckle John all the time, and I made no doubt that once his limbs
were freed he would try to kill me. The others were still asleep
while I tiptoed over to his corner. At first sight I got a fearsome
shock, for I thought he was dead of suffocation. He had worked
the gag out of his mouth, and lay as still as a corpse. But soon
I saw that he was sleeping quietly, and in his slumbers the madness
had died out of his face. He looked like any other sailorman,
a trifle ill-favoured of countenance, and dirty beyond the ordinary
of sea-folk.</p>

<p>When the gaoler came with food, we all wakened up, and Gib asked
very peaceably to be released. The gaoler laughed at his predicament,
and inquired the tale of it; and when he heard the truth, called
for a vote as to what he should do. I was satisfied, from the
look of Muckle John, that his dangerous fit was over, so I gave
my voice for release. Gib shook himself like a great dog, and
fell to his breakfast without a word. I found the thin brose provided
more palatable than the soup of the evening before, and managed
to consume a pannikin of it. As I finished, I perceived that Gib
had squatted by my side. There was clearly some change in the
man, for he gave the woman Isobel some very ill words when she
started ranting.</p>

<p>Up in the little square of window one could see a patch of clear
sky, with white clouds crossing it, and a gust of the clean air
of morning was blown into our cell. Gib sat looking at it with
his eyes abstracted, so that I feared a renewal of his daftness.</p>

<p>"Can ye whistle 'Jenny Nettles,' sir?" he asked me civilly.</p>

<p>It was surely a queer request in that place and from such a fellow.
But I complied, and to the best of my skill rendered the air.</p>

<p>He listened greedily. "Ay, you've got it," he said, humming it
after me. "I aye love the way of it. Yon's the tune I used to
whistle mysel' on shipboard when the weather was clear."</p>

<p>He had the seaman's trick of thinking of the weather first thing
in the morning, and this little thing wrought a change in my view
of him. His madness was seemingly like that of an epileptic, and
when it passed he was a simple creature with a longing for familiar
things.</p>

<p>"The wind's to the east," he said. "I could wish I were beating
down the Forth in the <em>Loupin' Jean.</em> She was a trim bit
boat for him that could handle her."</p>

<p>"Man," I said, "what made you leave a clean job for the ravings
of yesterday?"</p>

<p>"I'm in the Lord's hands," he said humbly. "I'm but a penny whistle
for His breath to blow on." This he said with such solemnity that
the meaning of a fanatic was suddenly revealed to me. One or two
distorted notions, a wild imagination, and fierce passions, and
there you have the ingredients ready. But moments of sense must
come, when the better nature of the man revives. I had a thought
that the clout he got on the stone floor had done much to clear
his wits.</p>

<p>"What will they do wi' me, think ye?" he asked. "This is the
second time I've fallen into the hands o' the Amalekites, and
it's no likely they'll let me off sae lightly."</p>

<p>"What will they do with us all?" said I. "The Plantations maybe,
or the Bass! It's a bonny creel you've landed me in, for I'm as
innocent as a newborn babe."</p>

<p>The notion of the Plantations seemed to comfort him. "I've been
there afore, once in the brig <em>John Rolfe</em> o' Greenock,
and once in the _Luckpenny _o' Leith. It's a het land but a bonny,
and full o' all manner o' fruits. You can see tobacco growin'
like aits, and mair big trees in one plantin' than in all the
shire o' Lothian. Besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>But I got no more of Muckle John's travels, for the door opened
on that instant, and the gaoler appeared. He looked at our heads,
then singled me out, and cried on me to follow. "Come on, you,"
he said. "Ye're wantit in the captain's room."</p>

<p>I followed in bewilderment; for I knew something of the law's
delays, and I could not believe that my hour of trial had come
already. The man took me down the turret stairs and through a
long passage to a door where stood two halberdiers. Through this
he thrust me, and I found myself in a handsome panelled apartment
with the city arms carved above the chimney. A window stood open,
and I breathed the sweet, fresh air with delight. But I caught
a reflection of myself in the polished steel of the fireplace,
and my spirits fell, for a more woebegone ruffian my eyes had
never seen. I was as dirty as a collier, my coat was half off
my back from my handling on the moor, and there were long rents
at the knees of my breeches.</p>

<p>Another door opened, and two persons entered. One was a dapper
little man with a great wig, very handsomely dressed in a plum-coloured
silken coat, with a snowy cravat at his neck. At the sight of
the other my face crimsoned, for it was the girl who had sung
Montrose's song in the rain.</p>

<p>The little gentleman looked at me severely, and then turned to
his companion. "Is this the fellow, Elspeth?" he inquired. "He
looks a sorry rascal."</p>

<p>The minx pretended to examine me carefully. Her colour was high
with the fresh morning, and she kept tapping her boot with her
whip handle.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Uncle Gregory," she said, "It is the very man, though
none the better for your night's attentions."</p>

<p>"And you say he had no part in Gib's company, but interfered
on your behalf when the madman threatened you?"</p>

<p>"Such was his impertinence," she said, "as if I were not a match
for a dozen crazy hill-folk. But doubtless the lad meant well."</p>

<p>"It is also recorded against him that he assaulted one of His
Majesty's servants, to wit, the trooper John Donald, and offered
to hinder him in the prosecution of his duty."</p>

<p>"La, uncle!" cried the girl, "who is to distinguish friend from
foe in a mellay? Have you never seen a dog in a fight bite the
hand of one who would succour him?"</p>

<p>"Maybe, maybe," said the gentleman. "Your illustrations, Elspeth,
would do credit to His Majesty's advocate. Your plea is that this
young man, whose name I do not know and do not seek to hear, should
be freed or justice will miscarry? God knows the law has enough
to do without clogging its wheels with innocence."</p>

<p>The girl nodded. Her wicked, laughing eyes roamed about the apartment
with little regard for my flushed face.</p>

<p>"Then the Crown assoilzies the panel and deserts the diet," said
the little gentleman. "Speak, sir, and thank His Majesty for his
clemency and this lady for her intercession."</p>

<p>I had no words, for if I had been sore at my imprisonment, I
was black angry at this manner of release. I did not reflect that
Miss Elspeth Blair must have risen early and ridden far to be
in the Canongate at this hour. 'Twas justice only that moved her,
I thought, and no gratitude or kindness. To her I was something
so lowly that she need not take the pains to be civil, but must
speak of me in my presence as if it were a question of a stray
hound. My first impulse was to refuse to stir, but happily my
good sense returned in time and preserved me from playing the
fool.</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir," I said gruffly&mdash;"and the lady. Do I understand
that I am free to go?"</p>

<p>"Through the door, down the left stairway, and you will be in
the street," said the gentleman.</p>

<p>I made some sort of bow and moved to the door.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Mr. Whiggamore," the girl cried, "Keep a cheerful
countenance, or they'll think you a Sweet-Singer. Your breeches
will mend, man."</p>

<p>And with her laughter most unpleasantly in my ears I made my
way into the Canongate, and so to my lodgings at Mrs. Macvittie's.</p>

</div>
<p>Three weeks later I heard that Muckle John was destined for the
Plantations in a ship of Mr. Barclay of Urie's, which traded to
New Jersey. I had a fancy to see him before he went, and after
much trouble I was suffered to visit him. His gaoler told me he
had been mighty wild during his examination before the Council,
and had had frequent bouts of madness since, but for the moment
he was peaceable. I found him in a little cell by himself, outside
the common room of the gaol. He was sitting in an attitude of
great dejection, and when I entered could scarcely recall me to
his memory. I remember thinking that, what with his high cheek-bones,
and lank black hair, and brooding eyes, and great muscular frame,
Scotland could scarcely have furnished a wilder figure for the
admiration of the Carolinas, or wherever he went to. I did not
envy his future master.</p>

<p>But with me he was very friendly and quiet. His ailment was home-sickness;
for though he had been a great voyager, it seemed he was loath
to quit our bleak countryside for ever. "I used aye to think o'
the first sight o' Inchkeith and the Lomond hills, and the smell
o' herrings at the pier o' Leith. What says the Word? '<em>Weep
not for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep sore for him that
goeth away, for he shall return no more, nor see his native country</em>.'"</p>

<p>I asked him if I could do him any service.</p>

<p>"There's a woman at Cramond," he began timidly. "She might like
to ken what had become o' me. Would ye carry a message?"</p>

<p>I did better, for at Gib's dictation I composed for her a letter,
since he could not write. I wrote it on some blank pages from
my pocket which I used for College notes. It was surely the queerest
love-letter ever indited, for the most part of it was theology,
and the rest was instructions for the disposing of his scanty
plenishing. I have forgotten now what I wrote, but I remember
that the woman's name was Alison Steel.</p>
