<p>So near had Danton been to Fessenden's thoughts that he was able
instantly to connect the Baltimorean's presence with the shopkeeper's
talk of the people from the steam yacht. He was the first to speak.
</p><p>"Where's Betty?"
</p><p>"She's with my wife--on the <u>West Wind</u>."
</p><p>"Your wife?"
</p><p>"Yes. I was married two days ago."
</p><p>"Danton! You--married? You're joking, old man."
</p><p>"Not in the least. I was married last Sunday--to Madge Yarnell."
</p><p>"Madge Yarnell! What!"
</p><p>"Is Mrs. Charles Danton," said the other.
</p><p>Fessenden was too dumfounded to do aught but stare. His friend slipped
an arm through his and turned him about.
</p><p>"There's room for us on the bench there. Let's talk it over. Madge and
Betty are doing the same down in the sand-hills now."
</p><p>Fessenden yielded without a word, and they seated themselves on the
bench.
</p><p>Danton was a man under thirty years. He was slight and pale, and had
much of the abrupt manner of that ancestor who had come to Baltimore in
the train of Jerome Bonaparte, and who, like his master, had found a
wife there.
</p><p>"You're really married?" said Fessenden. "By Jove! I can't get over it.
To Madge Yarnell, too. Then what in the world has become of--of--ah--"
</p><p>"Of a certain other lady?" appended his friend with perfect coolness. "I
don't blame you for wondering about her. But never mind now. I want to
tell you about my wedding. It was unique in the history of the
Chesapeake, I promise you." His laugh had a ring of heartiness that
surprised his listener. "Tom," he went on, "I'll be frank with you. I've
been in more than one crooked path in my time, but I'm through with that
sort of thing. Thank Heaven!"
</p><p>The other's amazement found expression. "I swear I don't know you.
What's come over you?"
</p><p>"Love," said Danton simply. "Madge's love, and all that it means. She
says she has told you of that tearing down the flag matter last year.
That proved to me and to her that I owned <u>her</u>--I'd known for a long
time that she owned <u>me</u>, you understand--but after that affair she sent
me away, and I, in revenge, went after--I was a cad, I know. Well, I
hope I'll never be again."
</p><p>"About your wedding, old man?"
</p><p>"I'm coming to that--and I'll skip the long story between. Last
Saturday, after Madge met you and Betty on the road, she galloped to
Sandywood Station, and sent me a reply to the wire I'd sent you."
</p><p>"A bit cool, that."
</p><p>"I've got it my pocket now. Here!" He read the bluish slip, smiling
faintly the while.
</p><p><strong>CHARLES DANTON</strong><br/>
    The Club, Baltimore.
</p><p>    Impossible to come, but understand. She promises to be <u>West
    Wind</u> eight o'clock Sunday night, ready.
</p><p>"Hum! What did that mean?"
</p><p>"It meant that I thought I understood. I thought that you had discovered
the--the Other Lady, in the farmhouse where she was hiding from me. I
believed she'd told you to tell me she was ready--at last. I'd had the
<u>Wisp</u> stored for that very reason, you know, and then shifted to the
<u>West Wind</u> because it was larger and more seaworthy, in case <u>she</u>
wanted to go right across to Gibraltar."
</p><p>"Was it as near a thing as that?"
</p><p>"No matter now. The result of the telegram was that I was at Polocoke
landing and aboard the <u>West Wind</u> by eight o'clock Sunday night. I give
you my word I never dreamed of a trick--who would?"
</p><p>"I don't see----"
</p><p>"You will in a moment. My skipper, Williams, met me as I came aboard.
'She's below, sir,' he said, 'and gave orders we were to put to sea just
as soon as you turned up.' Faithful soul! He didn't know he'd been
tricked either--doesn't know it yet, for that matter. He'd run away with
the Queen of India if he thought I wanted it done. 'Right,' I told him.
'Shove off, and go full speed as soon as you're clear.' With that, I
dived down into the main cabin. She wasn't there, and I looked into my
stateroom. I couldn't see her there either, so I stepped to the inner
stateroom--the two connect, you understand--where I thought she must
be."
</p><p>He smiled soberly at Fessenden's interested face. "Tom," he said, "every
word I'm telling you is for your soul's good. It's all the truth, but
it's a parable, too--for you. Well, as I reached the doorway between the
two rooms, somebody seized both my elbows from behind. By George! She's
as strong as a man."
</p><p>"What! Not----"
</p><p>"Yes, Madge."
</p><p>"Great Scott! I begin to have a glimmer."
</p><p>"I had just time to see that it <u>was</u> Madge before she pushed me
inside--into the inner room--and slammed the door behind me. It locked
with a spring."
</p><p>"She was outside?"
</p><p>"Yes, in my room. I was inside that."
</p><p>"I understand."
</p><p>"Precisely. I fancy I don't need to tell you much more. I was a prisoner
in my own yacht, and that yacht headed full speed down the bay, my men
acting upon what they thought were my own orders. A lovely girl was in
my room. I was as much separated from her as if I were in the moon, but
my own crew couldn't know that, and neither could the world."
</p><p>"She's a heroine."
</p><p>"She is--the most adorable in the world! She talked to me through the
closed door. What she said--well, that's only for her and me. I saw at
last what a mad fool I'd been. Then--then she threw herself on my
mercy."
</p><p>"You seem to have played the man."
</p><p>"She'd make a man of a snake! I saw myself in my true light at last; and
I understood her at last. God bless her!"
</p><p>"Amen!"
</p><p>"We ran on down to Old Point Comfort, and the chaplain at the fort
married us that same night."
</p><p>The two men shook hands.
</p><p>"After we left Old Point," went on Danton, "we cruised about a bit, got
mussed up by the storm, and ran in here. And then you--you and <u>Betty</u>
appeared."
</p><p>His emphasis brought a penetrating look from Fessenden.
</p><p>"You said you were telling me a parable. You don't mean--surely you
can't--Betty!"
</p><p>"I do."
</p><p>"Do you dare to think----"
</p><p>"I don't think anything. What I say is that my case furnishes a parallel
to yours."
</p><p>"Speak out, man! What! You mean you think I ought to marry her?"
</p><p>"Well, then--yes."
</p><p>"Good God! Marry Betty!"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>Fessenden rose abruptly to his feet and walked away a few paces. He
stared unseeingly across the stretch of sand to the sea beyond.
</p><p>A hundred images of Betty flitted before his mind's eye--images graceful
and smiling, sad and gay, merry and serious, always infinitely winsome.
Her voice sounded in his ear--teasing, angry, kind--always low-toned and
charming.
</p><p>He faced Danton. "Marry her? I've been wanting to do that very thing
since the first minute I saw her--only, I didn't know it."
</p><p>His friend's face shone with relief and pleasure. He broke into a boyish
laugh.
</p><p>"Great!" he said. "You're the right sort, Tom. I knew it, and I told
Madge so."
</p><p>Fessenden could not respond to the other's mood. "All very well. But
what will Betty say?"
</p><p>"Ask her."
</p><p>"I intend to. But is she old enough--is she in a position--to
understand?"
</p><p>"I tell you, yes."
</p><p>"And I tell you I'm very doubtful. A mere child, a country girl,
ignorant of the world, ignorant, perhaps, of what marriage means! It's a
hard position for me, and it may be worse--it may be horrible--for her."
</p><p>"Ask her," repeated Danton. "Look there!" He levelled his walking-stick.
"Do you see the dunes there--the second hill? Somewhere beyond that
you'll find Madge and Betty."
</p><p>Without another word, Fessenden pulled his cap over his eyes and strode
off.
</p><p>He skirted the first hillock, and on its farther side came abruptly upon
Madge Danton. She gave him a warm hand. Her eyes had lost their defiant
look; rather, it seemed to him, they included the world in their gentle
glance.
</p><p>"You'll find her beyond the next hill," she said.
</p><p>"You've talked to her--as Danton talked to me?"
</p><p>"Yes. She understands--her position. I know I don't need to warn you to
be--careful."
</p><p>"No, no."
</p><p>He did not find Betty beyond the next hill, nor the next. But, hastening
down the hollow ways, he almost stumbled over her at last--on a sunny
slope above the sea.
</p><p>She looked up at him, her eyes as clear as crystal. "Hello, Boatswain
Bob!"
</p><p>The greeting steadied him immeasurably. He knew that not so much what he
should say in the next few minutes, as how he should say it, might
determine the course of their lives. He longed with all his strength to
be given a divine tact and a divine gift of speech.
</p><p>He threw himself on the sand at a respectful distance. "Hello, Nancy
Lee!"
</p><p>Thanks to Kitty Hawk's "Bazaar," a scarlet ribbon again shone at Betty's
throat. Her hair was as he had last seen it--coiled superbly about her
head. Again he felt the air of dignity and aloofness of which the coiled
hair seemed the symbol.
</p><p>Fessenden's eyes, quiet and tender, met her own, his glance as clear as
hers.
</p><p>"Betty," he said, very simply, "we've been through a lot together, and I
want you to marry me. Will you? Don't think I'm asking you because of
any chivalrous fancy. I want you because I love you, and for nothing
else in the world." His own words fired him. "Dearest, I've loved you
since the first minute I saw you. You know that--in the bottom of your
heart, you know that's true."
</p><p>Her eyes, which at first had met his unwaveringly, quailed a little. The
red crept slowly into her cheeks.
</p><p>[Illustration: ALL THE CHIVALRY IN FESSENDEN'S NATURE STIRRED AT HER
<strong>WORDS]</strong>
</p><p>"I'm only a--a country girl," she said. "And you're the famous Mr.
Thomas Fessenden. I didn't know your real name until Madge told me, you
know."
</p><p>"Will you marry me, Betty?"
</p><p>She eyed him soberly. "Madge said I <u>must</u> say yes, if you asked me."
</p><p>"You poor child! Don't mind what she says. I want you to love me, if you
can."
</p><p>"I like you thoroughly, Bob White."
</p><p>"Is that all?"
</p><p>"That's all--I'm sorry," she answered gravely. "To marry a man, and not
to love him, would be--horrible."
</p><p>All the chivalry in Fessenden's nature stirred at her words. His
clenched hands sank to the wrists in the soft sand, and his voice shook
a little as he answered:
</p><p>"Not if--if we marry, and still remain only--friends."
</p><p>Her glance searched his soul. "O-oh! Can you--mean what you say?"
</p><p>"I give you my word of honor. Do you remember that night--good heavens!
was it only last Friday?--that night I had supper at your house, and
what I told you when you looked as if you were willing to say good-night
in a certain way?"
</p><p>"I remember."
</p><p>"Well, I'll stick by that."
</p><p>She rose to her feet.
</p><p>"You haven't answered me yet," he protested.
</p><p>Her face flushed exquisitely. "There's a church in Kitty Hawk," she
said. "And I believe a minister comes over from the mainland once a
month. Madge says he is due--to-morrow."
