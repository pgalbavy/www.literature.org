<p>By midday his mother was dead.  The word met him at the pit-mouth.
As he had known, inwardly, it was not a shock to him, and yet he
trembled.  He went home quite calmly, feeling only heavy in his
breathing.</p>

<p>Miss Louisa was still at the house.  She had seen to everything
possible.  Very succinctly, she informed him of what he needed to
know.  But there was one point of anxiety for her.</p>

<p>&quot;You DID half expect it - it's not come as a blow to you?&quot; she
asked, looking up at him.  Her eyes were dark and calm and
searching.  She too felt lost.  He was so dark and inchoate.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose - yes,&quot; he said stupidly.  He looked aside, unable to
endure her eyes on him.</p>

<p>&quot;I could not bear to think you might not have guessed,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>He felt it a great strain to have her near him at this time.  He
wanted to be alone.  As soon as the relatives began to arrive,
Louisa departed and came no more.  While everything was arranging,
and a crowd was in the house, whilst he had business to settle, he
went well enough, with only those uncontrollable paroxysms of
grief.  For the rest, he was superficial.  By himself, he endured
the fierce, almost insane bursts of grief which passed again and
left him calm, almost clear, just wondering.  He had not known
before that everything could break down, that he himself could
break down, and all be a great chaos, very vast and wonderful.  It
seemed as if life in him had burst its bounds, and he was lost in a
great, bewildering flood, immense and unpeopled.  He himself was
broken and spilled out amid it all.  He could only breathe panting
in silence.  Then the anguish came on again.</p>

<p>When all the people had gone from the Quarry Cottage, leaving the
young man alone with an elderly housekeeper, then the long trial
began.  The snow had thawed and frozen, a fresh fall had whitened
the grey, this then began to thaw.  The world was a place of loose
grey slosh.  Alfred had nothing to do in the evenings.  He was a
man whose life had been filled up with small activities.  Without
knowing it, he had been centralized, polarized in his mother.  It
was she who had kept him.  Even now, when the old housekeeper had
left him, he might still have gone on in his old way.  But the
force and balance of his life was lacking.  He sat pretending to
read, all the time holding his fists clenched, and holding himself
in, enduring he did not know what.  He walked the black and sodden
miles of field-paths, till he was tired out: but all this was only
running away from whence he must return.  At work he was all right.
If it had been summer he might have escaped by working in the
garden till bedtime.  But now, there was no escape, no relief,
no help.  He, perhaps, was made for action rather than for
understanding; for doing than for being.  He was shocked out of his
activities, like a swimmer who forgets to swim.</p>

<p>For a week, he had the force to endure this suffocation and
struggle, then he began to get exhausted, and knew it must come
out.  The instinct of self-preservation became strongest.  But
there was the question:  Where was he to go?  The public-house
really meant nothing to him, it was no good going there.  He began
to think of emigration.  In another country he would be all right.
He wrote to the emigration offices.</p>

<p>On the Sunday after the funeral, when all the Durant people had
attended church, Alfred had seen Miss Louisa, impassive and
reserved, sitting with Miss Mary, who was proud and very distant,
and with the other Lindleys, who were people removed.  Alfred saw
them as people remote.  He did not think about it.  They had
nothing to do with his life.  After service Louisa had come to him
and shaken hands.</p>

<p>&quot;My sister would like you to come to supper one evening, if you
would be so good.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked at Miss Mary, who bowed.  Out of kindness, Mary had
proposed this to Louisa, disapproving of herself even as she did
so.  But she did not examine herself closely.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Durant awkwardly, &quot;I'll come if you want me.&quot;  But he
vaguely felt that it was misplaced.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll come to-morrow evening, then, about half-past six.&quot;</p>

<p>He went.  Miss Louisa was very kind to him.  There could be no
music, because of the babies.  He sat with his fists clenched on
his thighs, very quiet and unmoved, lapsing, among all those
people, into a kind of muse or daze.  There was nothing between him
and them.  They knew it as well as he.  But he remained very steady
in himself, and the evening passed slowly.  Mrs Lindley called him
&quot;young man&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you sit here, young man?&quot;</p>

<p>He sat there.  One name was as good as another.  What had they to
do with him?</p>

<p>Mr Lindley kept a special tone for him, kind, indulgent, but
patronizing.  Durant took it all without criticism or offence,
just submitting.  But he did not want to eat - that troubled him,
to have to eat in their presence.  He knew he was out of place.
But it was his duty to stay yet awhile.  He answered precisely,
in monosyllables.</p>

<p>When he left he winced with confusion.  He was glad it was
finished.  He got away as quickly as possible.  And he wanted still
more intensely to go right away, to Canada.</p>

<p>Miss Louisa suffered in her soul, indignant with all of them, with
him too, but quite unable to say why she was indignant.</p>
