<P>
I HAD spoken confidently enough, while arguing the question of
Doctor Dulcifer's respectability with the Treasurer of the D
uskydale Institution; but, if my perceptions had  not been blinded
by my enthusiastic admiration for Alicia, I think I should have
secretly distrusted my own opinion as soon as I was left by
myself. Had I been in full possession of my senses, I might have
questioned, on reflection, whether the doctor's method of
accounting for the suspicions which kept his neighbors aloof from
him, was quite satisfactory. Love is generally described, I
believe, as the tender passion. When I remember the insidiously
relaxing effect of it on all my faculties, I feel inclined to
alter the popular definition, and to call it a moral vapor-bath.
<P>
What the Managing Committee of the Duskydale Institution thought
of the change in me, I cannot imagine. The doctor and his
daughter left the town on the day they had originally appointed,
before I could make any excuse for calling again; and, as a
necessary consequence of their departure, I lost all interest in
the affairs of the ball, and yawned in the faces of the committee
when I was obliged to be present at their deliberations in my
official capacity.
<P>
It was all Alicia with me, whatever they did. I read the Minutes
through a soft medium of maize-colored skirts. Notes of melodious
laughter bubbled, in my mind's ear, through all the drawling and
stammering of our speech-making members. When our dignified
President thought he had caught my eye, and made oratorical
overtures to me from the top of the table, I was lost in the
contemplation of silk purses and white fingers weaving them. I
meant "Alicia" when I said "hear, hear"--and when I officially
produced my subscription list, it was all aglow with the roseate
hues of the marriage-license. If any unsympathetic male readers
should think this statement exaggerated, I appeal to the
ladies--<i>they</i> will appreciate the rigid, yet tender, truth of
it.
<P>
The night of the ball came. I have nothing but the vaguest
recollection of it.
<P>
I remember that the more the perverse lecture theater was warmed
the more persistently it smelled of damp plaster; and that the
more brightly it was lighted, the more overgrown and lonesome it
looked. I can recall to mind that the company assembled numbered
about fifty, the room being big enough to hold three hundred. I
have a vision still before me, of twenty out of these fifty
guests, solemnly executing intricate figure-dances, under the
superintendence of an infirm local dancing-master--a mere speck
of fidgety human wretchedness twisting about in the middle of an
empty floor. I see, faintly, down the dim vista of the Past, an
agreeable figure, like myself, with a cocked hat under its arm,
black tights on its lightly tripping legs, a rosette in its
buttonhole, and an engaging smile on its face, walking from end
to end of the room, in the character of Master of the Ceremonies.
These visions and events I can recall vaguely; and with them my
remembrances of the ball come to a close. It was a complete
failure, and that would, of itself, have been enough to sicken me
of remaining at the Duskydale Institution, even if I had not had
any reasons of the tender sort for wishing to extend my travels
in rural England to the neighborhood of Barkingham.
<P>
The difficulty was how to find a decent pretext for getting away.
Fortunately, the Managing Committee relieved me of any perplexity
on this head, by passing a resolution, one day, which called upon
the President to remonstrate with me on my want of proper
interest in the affairs of the Institution. I replied to the
remonstrance that the affairs of the Institution were so
hopelessly dull that it was equally absurd and unjust to expect
any human being to take the smallest interest in them. At this
there arose an indignant cry of "Resign!" from the whole
committee; to which I answered politely, that I should be
delighted to oblige the gentlemen, and to go forthwith, on
condition of receiving a quarter's salary in the way of previous
compensation.
<P>
After a sordid opposition from an economical minority, my
condition of departure was accepted. I wrote a letter of
resignation, received in exchange twelve pounds ten shillings,
and took my place, that same day, on the box-seat of the
Barkingham mail.
<P>
Rather changeable this life of mine, was it not? Before I was
twenty-five years of age, I had tried doctoring, caricaturing
portrait-painting, old picture-making, and Institution-managing;
and now, with the help of Alicia, I was about to try how a little
marrying would suit me. Surely, Shakespeare must have had me
prophetically in his eye, when he wrote about "one man in his
time playing many parts." What a character I should have made for
him, if he had only been alive now!
<P>
I found out from the coachman, among other matters, that there
was a famous fishing stream near Barkingham; and the first thing
I did, on arriving at the town, was to buy a rod and line.
<P>
It struck me that my safest way of introducing myself would be to
tell Doctor Dulcifer that I had come to the neighborhood for a
little fishing, and so to prevent him from fancying that I was
suspiciously prompt in availing myself of his offered
hospitality. I put up, of course, at the inn--stuck a large
parchment book of flies half in and half out of the pocket of my
shooting-jacket--and set off at once to the doctor's. The waiter
of whom I asked my way stared distrustfully while he directed me.
The people at the inn had evidently heard of my new friend, and
were not favorably disposed toward the cause of scientific
investigation.
<P>
The house stood about a mile out of the town, in a dip of ground
near the famous fishing-stream. It was a lonely, old-fashioned
red-brick building, surrounded by high walls, with a garden and
plantation behind it.
<P>
As I rang at the gate-bell, I looked up at the house. Sure enough
all the top windows in front were closed with shutters and
barred. I was let in by a man in livery; who, however, in manners
and appearance, looked much more like a workman in disguise than
a footman. He had a very suspicious eye, and he fixed it on me
unpleasantly when I handed him my card.
<P>
I was shown into a morning-room exactly like other morning-rooms
in country houses.
<P>
After a long delay the doctor came in, with scientific butchers'
sleeves on his arms, and an apron tied round his portly waist. He
apologized for coming down in his working dress, and said
everything that was civil and proper about the pleasure of
unexpectedly seeing me again so soon. There was something rather
preoccupied, I thought, in those brightly resolute eyes of his;
but I naturally attributed it to the engrossing influence of his
scientific inquiries. He was evidently not at all taken in by my
story about coming to Barkingham to fish; but he saw, as well as
I did, that it would do to keep up appearances, and contrived to
look highly interested immediately in my parchment-book. I asked
after his daughter. He said she was in the garden, and proposed
that we should go and find her. We did find her, with a pair of
scissors in her hand, outblooming the flowers that she was
trimming. She looked really glad to see me--her brown eyes beamed
clear and kindly--she gave my hand another inestimable shake--the
summer breezes waved her black curls gently upward from her
waist--she had on a straw hat and a brown Holland gardening
dress. I eyed it with all the practical interest of a
linendraper. O Brown Holland you are but a coarse and cheap
fabric, yet how soft and priceless you look when clothing the
figure of Alicia!
<P>
I lunched with them. The doctor recurred to the subject of my
angling intentions, and asked his daughter if she had heard what
parts of the stream at Barkingham were best for fishing in.
<P>
She replied, with a mixture of modest evasiveness and adorable
simplicity, that she had sometimes seen gentlemen angling from a
meadow-bank about a quarter of a mile below her flower-garden. I
risked everything in my usual venturesome way, and asked if she
would show me where the place was, in case I called the next
morning with my fishing-rod. She looked dutifully at her father.
He smiled and nodded. Inestimable parent!
<P>
On rising to take leave, I was rather curious to know whether he
would o ffer me a bed in the house, or not. He detected  the
direction of my thoughts in my face and manner, and apologized
for not having a bed to offer me; every spare room in the house
being occupied by his chemical assistants, and by the lumber of
laboratories. Even while he was speaking those few words,
Alicia's face changed just as I had seen it change at our first
interview. The downcast, gloomy expression overspread it again.
Her father's eye wandered toward her when mine did, and suddenly
assumed the same distrustful look which I remembered detecting in
it, under similar circumstances, at Duskydale. What could this
mean?
<P>
The doctor shook hands with me in the hall, leaving the
workman-like footman to open the door.
<P>
I stopped to admire a fine pair of stag's antlers. The footman
coughed impatiently. I still lingered, hearing the doctor's
footsteps ascending the stairs. They suddenly stopped; and then
there was a low heavy clang, like the sound of a closing door
made of iron, or of some other unusually strong material; then
total silence, interrupted by another impatient cough from the
workman-like footman. After that, I thought my wisest proceeding
would be to go away before my mysterious attendant was driven to
practical extremities.
<P>
Between thoughts of Alicia, and inquisitive yearnings to know
more about the doctor's experiments, I passed rather a restless
night at my inn.
<P>
The next morning, I found the lovely mistress of my destiny, with
the softest of shawls on her shoulders, the brightest of parasols
in her hand, and the smart little straw hat of the day before on
her head, ready to show me the way to the fishing-place. If I
could be sure beforehand that these pages would only be read by
persons actually occupied in the making of love--that oldest and
longest-established of all branches of manufacturing industry--I
could go into some very tender and interesting particulars on the
subject of my first day's fishing, under the adorable auspices of
Alicia. But as I cannot hope for a wholly sympathetic
audience--as there may be monks, misogynists, political
economists, and other professedly hard-hearted persons present
among those whom I now address--I think it best to keep to safe
generalities, and to describe my love-making in as few sentences
as the vast, though soft, importance of the subject will allow me
to use.
<P>
Let me confess, then, that I assumed the character of a
fastidious angler, and managed to be a week in discovering the
right place to fish in--always, it is unnecessary to say, under
Alicia's guidance. We went up the stream and down the stream, on
one side. We crossed the bridge, and went up the stream and down
the stream on the other. We got into a punt, and went up the
stream (with great difficulty), and down the stream (with great
ease). We landed on a little island, and walked all round it, and
inspected the stream attentively from a central point of view. We
found the island damp, and went back to the bank, and up the
stream, and over the bridge, and down the stream again; and then,
for the first time, the sweet girl turned appealingly to me, and
confessed that she had exhausted her artless knowledge of the
locality. It was exactly a week from the day when I had first
followed her into the fields with my fishing-rod over my
shoulder; and I had never yet caught anything but Alicia's hand,
and that not with my hook.
<P>
We sat down close together on the bank, entirely in consequence
of our despair at not finding a good fishing-place. I looked at
the brown eyes, and they turned away observantly down the stream.
I followed them, and they turned away inquiringly up the stream.
Was this angel of patience and kindness still looking for a
fishing place? And was it <i>up</i> the stream, after all? No! --she
smiled and shook her head when I asked the question, and the
brown eyes suddenly stole a look at me. I could hold out no
longer In one breathless moment I caught hold of both her
hands--in one stammering sentence I asked her if she would be my
wife.
<P>
She tried faintly to free her hands--gave up the
attempt--smiled--made an effort to look grave--gave that up,
too--sighed suddenly--checked herself suddenly--said nothing.
Perhaps I ought to have taken my answer for granted; but the
least business-like man that ever lived becomes an eminently
practical character in matters of love. I repeated my question.
She looked away confusedly; her eye lighted on a corner of her
father's red-brick house, peeping through a gap in the plantation
already mentioned; and her blushing cheeks lost their color
instantly. I felt her hands grow cold; she drew them resolutely
out of mine, and rose with the tears in her eyes. Had I offended
her?
<P>
"No," she said when I asked her the question, and turned to me
again, and held out her hand with such frank, fearless kindness,
that I almost fell on my knees to thank her for it.
<P>
Might I hope ever to hear her say "Yes" to the question that I
had asked on the riverbank?
<P>
She sighed bitterly, and turned again toward the red-brick house.
<P>
Was there any family reason against her saying "Yes"? Anything
that I must not inquire into? Any opposition to be dreaded from
her father?
<P>
The moment I mentioned her father, she shrank away from me and
burst into a violent fit of crying.
<P>
"Don't speak of it again!" she said in a broken voice. "I
mustn't--you mustn't--ah, don't, don't say a word more about it!
I'm not distressed with you--it is not your fault. Don't say
anything--leave me quiet for a minute. I shall soon be better it
you leave me quiet."
<P>
She dried her eyes directly, with a shiver as if it was cold, and
took my arm. I led her back to the house-gate; and then, feeling
that I could not go in to lunch as usual, after what had
happened, said I would return to the fishing-place.
<P>
"Shall I come to dinner this evening?" I asked, as I rang the
gate-bell for her.
<P>
"Oh, yes--yes!--do come, or he--"
<P>
The mysterious man-servant opened the door, and we parted before
she could say the next words.
