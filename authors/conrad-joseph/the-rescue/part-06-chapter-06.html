<p>Thirty-six hours later Carter, alone with Lingard in the cabin
of the brig, could almost feel during a pause in his talk the
oppressive, the breathless peace of the Shallows awaiting another
sunset.</p>

<p>"I never expected to see any of you alive," Carter began in his
easy tone, but with much less carelessness in his bearing as though
his days of responsibility amongst the Shoals of the Shore of
Refuge had matured his view of the external world and of his own
place therein.</p>

<p>"Of course not," muttered Lingard.</p>

<p>The listlessness of that man whom he had always seen acting under
the stress of a secret passion seemed perfectly appalling to Carter's
youthful and deliberate energy. Ever since he had found himself
again face to face with Lingard he had tried to conceal the shocking
impression with a delicacy which owed nothing to training but
was as intuitive as a child's.</p>

<p>While justifying to Lingard his manner of dealing with the situation
on the Shore of Refuge, he could not for the life of him help
asking himself what was this new mystery. He was also young enough
to long for a word of commendation.</p>

<p>"Come, Captain," he argued; "how would you have liked to come
out and find nothing but two half-burnt wrecks stuck on the sands&mdash;perhaps?"</p>

<p>He waited for a moment, then in sheer compassion turned away
his eyes from that fixed gaze, from that harassed face with sunk
cheeks, from that figure of indomitable strength robbed of its
fire. He said to himself: "He doesn't hear me," and raised his
voice without altering its self-contained tone:</p>

<p>"I was below yesterday morning when we felt the shock, but the
noise came to us only as a deep rumble. I made one jump for the
companion but that precious Shaw was before me yelling, 'Earthquake!
Earthquake!' and I am hanged if he didn't miss his footing and
land down on his head at the bottom of the stairs. I had to stop
to pick him up but I got on deck in time to see a mighty black
cloud that seemed almost solid pop up from behind the forest like
a balloon. It stayed there for quite a long time. Some of our
Calashes on deck swore to me that they had seen a red flash above
the tree-tops. But that's hard to believe. I guessed at once that
something had blown up on shore. My first thought was that I would
never see you any more and I made up my mind at once to find out
all the truth you have been keeping away from me. No, sir! Don't
you make a mistake! I wasn't going to give you up, dead or alive."</p>

<p>He looked hard at Lingard while saying these words and saw the
first sign of animation pass over that ravaged face. He saw even
its lips move slightly; but there was no sound, and Carter looked
away again.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would have done better by telling me everything;
but you left me behind on my own to be your man here. I put my
hand to the work I could see before me. I am a sailor. There were
two ships to look after. And here they are both for you, fit to
go or to stay, to fight or to run, as you choose." He watched
with bated breath the effort Lingard had to make to utter the
two words of the desired commendation:</p>

<p>"Well done!"</p>

<p>"And I am your man still," Carter added, impulsively, and hastened
to look away from Lingard, who had tried to smile at him and had
failed. Carter didn't know what to do next, remain in the cabin
or leave that unsupported strong man to himself. With a shyness
completely foreign to his character and which he could not understand
himself, he suggested in an engaging murmur and with an embarrassed
assumption of his right to give advice:</p>

<p>"Why not lie down for a bit, sir? I can attend to anything that
may turn up. You seem done up, sir."</p>

<p>He was facing Lingard, who stood on the other side of the table
in a leaning forward attitude propped up on rigid arms and stared
fixedly at him&mdash;perhaps? Carter felt on the verge of despair.
This couldn't last. He was relieved to see Lingard shake his head
slightly.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Carter. I think I will go on deck," said the Captain
of the famous brig Lightning, while his eyes roamed all over the
cabin. Carter stood aside at once, but it was some little time
before Lingard made a move.</p>

<p>The sun had sunk already, leaving that evening no trace of its
glory on a sky clear as crystal and on the waters without a ripple.
All colour seemed to have gone out of the world. The oncoming
shadow rose as subtle as a perfume from the black coast lying
athwart the eastern semicircle; and such was the silence within
the horizon that one might have fancied oneself come to the end
of time. Black and toylike in the clear depths and the final stillness
of the evening the brig and the schooner lay anchored in the middle
of the main channel with their heads swung the same way. Lingard,
with his chin on his breast and his arms folded, moved slowly
here and there about the poop. Close and mute like his shadow,
Carter, at his elbow, followed his movements. He felt an anxious
solicitude. . . .</p>

<p>It was a sentiment perfectly new to him. He had never before
felt this sort of solicitude about himself or any other man. His
personality was being developed by new experience, and as he was
very simple he received the initiation with shyness and self-mistrust.
He had noticed with innocent alarm that Lingard had not looked
either at the sky or over the sea, neither at his own ship nor
the schooner astern; not along the decks, not aloft, not anywhere.
He had looked at nothing! And somehow Carter felt himself more
lonely and without support than when he had been left alone by
that man in charge of two ships entangled amongst the Shallows
and environed by some sinister mystery. Since that man had come
back, instead of welcome relief Carter felt his responsibility
rest on his young shoulders with tenfold weight. His profound
conviction was that Lingard should be roused.</p>

<p>"Captain Lingard," he burst out in desperation; "you can't say
I have worried you very much since this morning when I received
you at the side, but I must be told something. What is it going
to be with us? Fight or run?"</p>

<p>Lingard stopped short and now there was no doubt in Carter's
mind that the Captain was looking at him. There was no room for
any doubt before that stern and enquiring gaze. "Aha!" thought
Carter. "This has startled him"; and feeling that his shyness
had departed he pursued his advantage. "For the fact of the matter
is, sir, that, whatever happens, unless I am to be your man you
will have no officer. I had better tell you at once that I have
bundled that respectable, crazy, fat Shaw out of the ship. He
was upsetting all hands. Yesterday I told him to go and get his
dunnage together because I was going to send him aboard the yacht.
He couldn't have made more uproar about it if I had proposed to
chuck him overboard. I warned him that if he didn't go quietly
I would have him tied up like a sheep ready for slaughter. However,
he went down the ladder on his own feet, shaking his fist at me
and promising to have me hanged for a pirate some day. He can
do no harm on board the yacht. And now, sir, it's for you to give
orders and not for me&mdash;thank God!"</p>

<p>Lingard turned away, abruptly. Carter didn't budge. After a moment
he heard himself called from the other side of the deck and obeyed
with alacrity.</p>

<p>"What's that story of a man you picked up on the coast last evening?" 
asked Lingard in his gentlest tone. "Didn't you tell me something
about it when I came on board?"</p>

<p>"I tried to," said Carter, frankly. "But I soon gave it up. You
didn't seem to pay any attention to what I was saying. I thought
you wanted to be left alone for a bit. What can I know of your
ways, yet, sir? Are you aware, Captain Lingard, that since this
morning I have been down five times at the cabin door to look
at you? There you sat. . . ."</p>

<p>He paused and Lingard said: "You have been five times down in
the cabin?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And the sixth time I made up my mind to make you take some
notice of me. I can't be left without orders. There are two ships
to look after, a lot of things to be done. . . ."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be done," Lingard interrupted with a mere
murmur but in a tone which made Carter keep silent for a while.</p>

<p>"Even to know that much would have been something to go by,"
he ventured at last. "I couldn't let you sit there with the sun
getting pretty low and a long night before us."</p>

<p>"I feel stunned yet," said Lingard, looking Carter straight in
the face, as if to watch the effect of that confession.</p>

<p>"Were you very near that explosion?" asked the young man with
sympathetic curiosity and seeking for some sign on Lingard's person.
But there was nothing. Not a single hair of the Captain's head
seemed to have been singed.</p>

<p>"Near," muttered Lingard. "It might have been my head." He pressed
it with both hands, then let them fall. "What about that man?"
he asked, brusquely. "Where did he come from? . . . I suppose
he is dead now," he added in an envious tone.</p>

<p>"No, sir. He must have as many lives as a cat," answered Carter.
"I will tell you how it was. As I said before I wasn't going to
give you up, dead or alive, so yesterday when the sun went down
a little in the afternoon I had two of our boats manned and pulled
in shore, taking soundings to find a passage if there was one.
I meant to go back and look for you with the brig or without the
brig&mdash;but that doesn't matter now. There were three or four floating
logs in sight. One of the Calashes in my boat made out something
red on one of them. I thought it was worth while to go and see
what it was. It was that man's sarong. It had got entangled among
the branches and prevented him rolling off into the water. I was
never so glad, I assure you, as when we found out that he was
still breathing. If we could only nurse him back to life, I thought,
he could perhaps tell me a lot of things. The log on which he
hung had come out of the mouth of the creek and he couldn't have
been more than half a day on it by my calculation. I had him taken
down the main hatchway and put into a hammock in the 'tween-decks.
He only just breathed then, but some time during the night he
came to himself and got out of the hammock to lie down on a mat.
I suppose he was more comfortable that way. He recovered his speech
only this morning and I went down at once and told you of it,
but you took no notice. I told you also who he was but I don't
know whether you heard me or not."</p>

<p>"I don't remember," said Lingard under his breath.</p>

<p>"They are wonderful, those Malays. This morning he was only half
alive, if that much, and now I understand he has been talking
to Wasub for an hour. Will you go down to see him, sir, or shall
I send a couple of men to carry him on deck?"</p>

<p>Lingard looked bewildered for a moment.</p>

<p>"Who on earth is he?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, it's that fellow whom you sent out, that night I met you,
to catch our first gig. What do they call him? Jaffir, I think.
Hasn't he been with you ashore, sir? Didn't he find you with the
letter I gave him for you? A most determined looking chap. I knew
him again the moment we got him off the log."</p>

<p>Lingard seized hold of the royal backstay within reach of his
hand. Jaffir! Jaffir! Faithful above all others; the messenger
of supreme moments; the reckless and devoted servant! Lingard
felt a crushing sense of despair. "No, I can't face this," he
whispered to himself, looking at the coast black as ink now before
his eyes in the world's shadow that was slowly encompassing the
grey clearness of the Shallow Waters. "Send Wasub to me. I am
going down into the cabin."</p>

<p>He crossed over to the companion, then checking himself suddenly:
"Was there a boat from the yacht during the day?" he asked as
if struck by a sudden thought.&mdash;"No, sir," answered Carter. "We
had no communication with the yacht to-day."&mdash;"Send Wasub to me,"
repeated Lingard in a stern voice as he went down the stairs.</p>

<p>The old serang coming in noiselessly saw his Captain as he had
seen him many times before, sitting under the gilt thunderbolts,
apparently as strong in his body, in his wealth, and in his knowledge
of secret words that have a power over men and elements, as ever.
The old Malay squatted down within a couple of feet from Lingard,
leaned his back against the satinwood panel of the bulkhead, then
raising his old eyes with a watchful and benevolent expression
to the white man's face, clasped his hands between his knees.</p>

<p>"Wasub, you have learned now everything. Is there no one left
alive but Jaffir? Are they all dead?"</p>

<p>"May you live!" answered Wasub; and Lingard whispered an appalled
"All dead!" to which Wasub nodded slightly twice. His cracked
voice had a lamenting intonation. "It is all true! It is all true!
You are left alone, Tuan; you are left alone!"</p>

<p>"It was their destiny," said Lingard at last, with forced calmness.
"But has Jaffir told you of the manner of this calamity? How is
it that he alone came out alive from it to be found by you?"</p>

<p>"He was told by his lord to depart and he obeyed," began Wasub,
fixing his eyes on the deck and speaking just loud enough to be
heard by Lingard, who, bending forward in his seat, shrank inwardly
from every word and yet would not have missed a single one of
them for anything.</p>

<p>For the catastrophe had fallen on his head like a bolt from the
blue in the early morning hours of the day before. At the first
break of dawn he had been sent for to resume, his talk with Belarab.
He had felt suddenly Mrs. Travers remove her hand from his head.
Her voice speaking intimately into his ear: "Get up. There are
some people coming," had recalled him to himself. He had got up
from the ground. The light was dim, the air full of mist; and
it was only gradually that he began to make out forms above his
head and about his feet: trees, houses, men sleeping on the ground.
He didn't recognize them. It was but a cruel change of dream.
Who could tell what was real in this world? He looked about him,
dazedly; he was still drunk with the deep draught of oblivion
he had conquered for himself. Yes&mdash;but it was she who had let
him snatch the cup. He looked down at the woman on the bench.
She moved not. She had remained like that, still for hours, giving
him a waking dream of rest without end, in an infinity of happiness
without sound and movement, without thought, without joy; but
with an infinite ease of content, like a world-embracing reverie
breathing the air of sadness and scented with love. For hours
she had not moved.</p>

<p>"You are the most generous of women," he said. He bent over her.
Her eyes were wide open. Her lips felt cold. It did not shock
him. After he stood up he remained near her. Heat is a consuming
thing, but she with her cold lips seemed to him indestructible&mdash;and,
perhaps, immortal!</p>

<p>Again he stooped, but this time it was only to kiss the fringe
of her head scarf. Then he turned away to meet the three men,
who, coming round the corner of the hut containing the prisoners,
were approaching him with measured steps. They desired his presence
in the Council room. Belarab was awake.</p>

<p>They also expressed their satisfaction at finding the white man
awake, because Belarab wanted to impart to him information of
the greatest importance. It seemed to Lingard that he had been
awake ever since he could remember. It was as to being alive that
he felt not so sure. He had no doubt of his existence; but was
this life&mdash;this profound indifference, this strange contempt for
what his eyes could see, this distaste for words, this unbelief
in the importance of things and men? He tried to regain possession
of himself, his old self which had things to do, words to speak
as well as to hear. But it was too difficult. He was seduced away
by the tense feeling of existence far superior to the mere consciousness
of life, and which in its immensity of contradictions, delight,
dread, exultation and despair could not be faced and yet was not
to be evaded. There was no peace in it. But who wanted peace?
Surrender was better, the dreadful ease of slack limbs in the
sweep of an enormous tide and in a divine emptiness of mind. If
this was existence then he knew that he existed. And he knew that
the woman existed, too, in the sweep of the tide, without speech,
without movement, without heat! Indestructible&mdash;and, perhaps,
immortal!</p>
