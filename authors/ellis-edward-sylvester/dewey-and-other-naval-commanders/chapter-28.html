<p>A Man Devoid of Fear&mdash;William Barker Cushing&mdash;Some of His Exploits
&mdash;The Blowing Up of the <em>Albemarle</em> &mdash;His Sad
Death.</p>

<p>If ever man lived who knew not the meaning of fear, he was William
Barker Cushing, born in Wisconsin in 1842. He entered the Naval
Academy in 1857, remained four years, received his appointment
from the State of New York, but claiming Pennsylvania as his residence.
He was wild and reckless, and resigned in March, 1861, when even
his closest friends saw little hope of his success in life.</p>

<p>Many heroes are referred to as fearless, but that man is reckoned
brave who knows the full extent of the danger facing him, and
yet does not hesitate to meet it; but Cushing was a youth who
really seemed to love danger for its own sake, and never flinched
while death was on every hand, but went unhesitatingly forward,
when it would have been no reflection upon his courage had he
turned about and run.</p>

<p>The breaking out of the Civil War offered so fascinating a field
for him that he could not resist the temptation. The Secretary
of the Navy always had a tender spot in his heart for the daring
fellow, and when Cushing promised that if he would give him a
chance he would prove himself worthy of the Secretary's confidence,
that official consented and attached him to the North Atlantic
Blockading Squadron. At the very first opportunity Cushing displayed
the wonderful personal intrepidity which was soon to make him
the most famous naval officer of his age.</p>

<p>In the expedition against Franklin, Va., in the autumn of the
year, he was placed in command of the gunboat <em>Ellis</em>,
and showed such skill and bravery that he was recommended by the
acting admiral to the Navy Department. Some weeks later he steamed
into New River Inlet, with the object of capturing Jacksonville
and destroying the salt works. He was successful, secured three
vessels and drove the enemy from two pieces of artillery with
which they were firing on him at short range. All was going well,
but while still close to the abandoned works Cushing's little
steamer ran aground, and, despite every effort, he could not work
her free.</p>

<p>He saw it was useless to try to get the boat off. He therefore
took everything out of her, excepting the pivot gun and ammunition,
and, placing them on board one of the captured schooners, ordered
the crew to leave. Knowing the enemy would soon return in overwhelming
numbers, he asked for six volunteers to stay with him and fight
with the single gun to the last. The response was prompt, for
his daring spirit was infectious, and he instructed the others,
in the event of him and his comrades being attacked, to make no
attempt to help them.</p>

<p>Just as he anticipated, the Confederates opened upon the doomed
steamer at daylight, firing from so many different points that
the defenders were helpless. As fast as the gun could be loaded,
it was pointed here, there and everywhere, for, no matter in what
direction it was aimed, it was pretty sure to hit some of the
enemy; but a single gun against a score could accomplish nothing,
and the lieutenant had to decide whether to remain, with the certainty
of every man being shot to pieces, of surrendering, or of rowing
in an open boat for more than a mile through the murderous fire.
With scarcely a moment's hesitation, he resolved upon the last
plan, which looked as suicidal as remaining on the steamer.</p>

<p>The gun was loaded to the muzzle and trained upon the enemy,
so as to go off when heated, the steamer set on fire in several
places, and, dropping into the smaller boat, the men pulled with
might and main for the schooner. Fortune favors the brave, and
they reached it in safety, and soon after arrived at Beaufort.</p>

<p>This exploit won for Cushing the commendation of the Navy Department
for "his courage, coolness and gallantry."</p>

<p>His restless spirit would not allow him to remain idle. He was
continually engaging in some daring enterprise, in which it must
not be supposed he displayed nothing more than headlong recklessness.
That quality was supplemented by coolness and skill, without which
he never could have attained the remarkable success that attended
his career.</p>

<p>Among the numerous achievements the following will serve as an
illustration of the young man's disposition:</p>

<p>Lieutenants Lamson and Cushing had command of a number of gunboats
that were sent to the aid of General Peck, stationed at Norfolk.
In the latter part of April it was learned that a Union boat had
been decoyed ashore by the display of a white handkerchief and
then fired upon. The angered Cushing asked for and received the
privilege of retaliating for this treacherous act. In charge of
seven boats, manned by ninety sailors, he set out and landed under
the protection of the fire of the vessels. Leaving a part of his
force to protect the boats, he started inland, taking a 12-pounder
howitzer with him.</p>

<p>His objective point was a village three miles away, where several
hundred cavalry were stationed. Advancing boldly, he drove in
the pickets, and coming across a span of mules hitched to a cart,
he tied the rope of the howitzer to the rear, lashed the animals
to a gallop and went clattering into the village to the loud shouts
of "Forward, double quick!"</p>

<p>Just as they entered the formidable body of cavalry were discerned,
galloping down the street toward them, swinging their sabres and
shouting at the top of their voices. In a twinkling the howitzer
was unlimbered, and the charge of grape which was poured into
the approaching horsemen was supplemented by a volley of musketry.
The racket terrified the mules, which broke into a gallop, dragging
the cart and ammunition after them, and never paused until they
were among the ranks of the enemy. With a shout, Cushing was after
them, followed by his men, and mules and ammunition were recovered
in a twinkling. By this time the demoralized cavalry had fled,
and Cushing, after retaining possession of the village until dusk,
leisurely made his way back to the boats.</p>

<p>The war having proven the immeasurable value of ironclads of
the <em>Merrimac</em> type, the Confederates strained every nerve
to build them, often succeeding under the most trying conditions.
One of the most formidable of these craft was the <em>Albemarle</em>,
upon which work was begun early in 1863, at Edward's Ferry, several
miles up the Roanoke River. Iron was so scarce that the country
was scoured for miles in every direction for bolts, bars and metal.
As stated by Maclay, the keel was laid in an open cornfield, and
an ordinary blacksmith's outfit formed the plant for building;
but the makers persevered and completed a craft 122 feet over
all, with 45 feet beam and drawing 8 feet of water. The casemate
was 60 feet long, constructed of massive timbers, covered with
4-inch planking, over which were placed two layers of 2-inch iron.
The motive power was furnished by twin screws operated by engines
of 200 horse-power each. Her armament consisted of an Armstrong
100-pounder in the bow and another in the stern, the casemate
being so pierced that the guns could be used at broadside or quarter.</p>

<p>At midnight, April 19, 1864, the <em>Albemarle</em> gave a proof
of her prodigious power of destruction. On the preceding two days
the Confederates had made a determined attack on Plymouth, held
by the Union forces, and the ironclad now set out to render assistance.
The wooden gunboats <em>Miami</em> and <em>Southfield</em> offered
just the sort of targets the monster fancied. Under a full head
of steam, the <em>Albemarle</em> rammed her iron beak clean into
the fire room of the <em>Southfield</em>. The latter was skewered
upon the projection and began slowly sinking. The snout was so
entangled with the <em>Southfield</em> that the victim could not
be shaken off, and as she sank she carried her foe with her. The
bow of the ironclad dipped below the surface, and a most extraordinary
and inglorious end seemed inevitable, when the <em>Southfield</em>
touched bottom, rolled over and freed itself from the bow of the
ram, which popped up again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <em>Miami</em> was pounding the iron hide of the
monster, which shed the missiles as the <em>Merrimac</em> shed
the broadsides from the <em>Cumberland</em> and <em>Congress</em>.
When only a few feet from the <em>Albemarle</em>, Lieutenant Flusser,
standing directly behind a gun of the <em>Miami</em>, let fly
with a heavy shell, which, striking the armor of the <em>Albemarle</em>,
was shivered into a thousand fragments, most of which rebounding,
instantly killed the officer and wounded a dozen men. The <em>Miami</em>
retreated, and the next day Plymouth surrendered to the Confederates.</p>

<p>In May, the <em>Albemarle</em> steamed down into the Sound and
attacked the Union gunboats, which made a heroic defence. The
monster received broadside after broadside and was repeatedly
rammed, but suffered no material damage, while she killed 4, wounded
25 and caused the scalding of 13, through piercing the boiler
of one of her assailants.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this ironclad had become a formidable menace
to the Union arms, not only in the immediate neighborhood, but
further north. It was the intention of her commander to clear
out the fleets at the mouth of the river, and then make an excursion
up the coast, somewhat like that which Secretary Stanton once
believed the <em>Merrimac</em> was about to undertake. General
Grant was pressing his final campaign against Richmond, and the
<em>Albemarle</em> threatened to interfere with his plans, for
if she made the diversion of which she was capable, she was likely
to postpone indefinitely the wind up of the war.</p>

<p>Ah, if some daring scheme could be perfected for destroying the
<em>Albemarle</em>! What a feat it would be and how vast the good
it would accomplish! There was one young officer in the American
navy who believed the thing could be done, and he volunteered
to undertake it.</p>

<p>Well aware that the Unionists would neglect no means of blowing
up the <em>Albemarle</em>, the Confederates used every possible
precaution. At the wharf in Plymouth, where she was moored, a
thousand soldiers were on guard, and her crew, consisting of sixty
men, were alert and vigilant. To prevent the approach of a torpedo
boat, the ram was surrounded by a boom of cypress logs, placed
a considerable distance from the hull, and a double line of sentries
was stationed along the river. What earthly chance was there under
such conditions of any possible harm coming to her?</p>

<p>The picket boat in which Lieutenant Cushing undertook to destroy
the rebel ram was built at New York under his supervision, and
taken to Norfolk by way of the canals, and thence to Albemarle
Sound again by canal. He made his preparations with great care,
and on the night of October 27, which was dark and stormy, he
started in his picket boat. He was accompanied by eight men and
the following officers: Acting Ensign William L. Howarth, Acting
Master's Mates Thomas S. Gay and John Woodman, Acting Assistant
Paymaster Francis H. Swan, Acting Third Assistant Engineers Charles
L. Steever and William Stotesbury.</p>

<p>Cushing took in tow a small cutter, in which he intended to capture
the Confederate guard, that was in a schooner anchored near the
wrecked <em>Southfield</em>, and prevent their sending up an alarm
rocket as a warning to the sentinels above of the approach of
danger. He stationed himself at the stern, his plan being to land
a little way below the ram and board her from the wharf. A sudden
dash promised her capture by surprise, when she could be taken
down stream. If this scheme could not be carried out, he intended
to blow her up with a torpedo as she lay at the dock.</p>

<p>The launch crept along the river bank as silently as an Indian
canoe stealing into a hostile camp. The distance to be passed
was fully eight miles, and the peril began almost from the moment
of starting. The necessary commands were spoken in whispers, and
the waiting men scarcely moved as they peered into the deep gloom
and listened to the almost inaudible rippling of the water from
the bow. Speed was reduced as they drew near Plymouth, in order
to lessen the soft clanking of the engine or the motion of the
screw.</p>

<p>They were still a mile below Plymouth when the shadowy outlines
of the wrecked <em>Southfield</em> loomed dimly to view. The Confederates
had raised her so that her hurricane deck was above the surface.
Within a few yards of the wreck a schooner was anchored containing
a guard of twenty men with a field piece and rocket, provided
for precisely such danger as now drew near. But on this night,
of all others, the sentinels were dozing, for had they been vigilant
they must have seen the little craft whose crew saw theirs and
were on the <em>qui vive</em> to board on the instant of discovery.</p>

<p>The good fortune encouraged all hands, and as the schooner and
wreck melted into the darkness the launch swept around a bend
in the river and caught the glimmer of the camp fires along the
banks, partly extinguished by the falling rain. Still creeping
cautiously on, the outlines of the prodigious ram gradually assumed
form in the gloom. It looked as if the surprise would be complete,
when a dog, more watchful than his masters, began barking. He
had discovered the approaching danger, and the startled sentinels
challenged, but no reply was made. A second challenge bringing
no response, several muskets flashed in the night. Other dogs
joined in barking, alarm rattles were sprung and wood flung upon
the fires, which, flaring up, threw their illumination out on
the river and revealed the launch and cutter. The hoarse commands
of officers rang out, and the soldiers, springing from sleep,
caught up their guns and rushed to quarters.</p>

<p>Amid the fearful din and peril Cushing cut the tow line and ordered
the cutter to hasten down the river and capture the guard near
the <em>Southfield</em>. At the same moment he directed the launch
to go ahead at full speed. He had changed his plan. Instead of
landing he determined to blow up the ram. When close to it he
learned for the first time of the cordon of logs which surrounded
the <em>Albemarle</em>, but, believing they were slippery enough
from remaining long in the water to be passed, he sheered off,
made a sweep of a hundred yards and again charged under full steam
for the obstruction.</p>

<p>As he drew near the guards fired a volley which riddled Cushing's
coat and tore off the sole of his shoe.</p>

<p>At the same moment he heard the vicious snapping of the primers
of the huge guns, which showed they had missed fire.</p>

<p>"Leave the ram!" he shouted. "We're going to blow you up!"</p>

<p>The Confederates, however, did not follow the advice and the
launch fired her howitzer. Then she glided over the slimy logs
and paused in front of the muzzle of a loaded cannon which could
be almost reached with the outstretched hand. Still cool and self-possessed
amid the horrible perils, Cushing stood erect, lowered the torpedo
spar, shoved it under the overhang, waited a moment for it to
rise until he felt it touch the bottom of the ram, when he gave
a quick, strong pull on the trigger line. A muffled, thunderous
explosion followed, an immense column of water rose in the air
and the tremendous tipping of the <em>Albemarle</em> showed she
had received a mortal hurt.</p>

<p>It was accomplished at the critical second, for the rifled gun,
filled with 100 pounds of canister and pointed at the launch ten
feet away, was immediately discharged. The careening of the ram
deviated the aim just enough to prevent the crew from being blown
to fragments, but confident that not a man could escape, the Confederates
twice called upon their assailants to surrender, and several did
so, but Cushing was not among them. With the same marvelous coolness
he had displayed from the first he took off his coat and shoes,
flung his sword and revolver aside and shouted:</p>

<p>"Every man save himself!"</p>

<p>Then he leaped into the water and began swimming with might and
main down stream, the bullets skipping all about him, but he soon
passed beyond sight and was still swimming when he heard a plashing
near him. It was made by one of the acting master's mates, John
Woodman, who was exhausted. Cushing helped him until he himself
had hardly an ounce of strength left, when he was obliged to let
go, and the poor fellow, calling good-by, sank from sight.</p>

<p>When unable to struggle longer, Cushing let his feet drop and
they touched bottom. He managed to reach land, where he sank down
so worn out that he lay motionless until daylight. Then he crawled
into a swamp, where he remained hidden until a friendly negro
appeared, who extended every possible kindness to him. From him
Cushing learned that the <em>Albemarle</em> had been destroyed
and was at the bottom of the river. It was thrilling news, and
the following night, after he had thoroughly rested and been fed
by his dusky friend, he moved down the river, found a skiff and
in it made his way to the fleet, bringing the first news of the
success of an exploit which it is safe to say has never been surpassed
in the history of our navy. Even the captain of the <em>Albemarle</em>
declared that "a more gallant thing was not done during the war."</p>

<p>While conceding to Lieutenant Hobson the full credit for his
daring achievement in sinking the <em>Merrimac</em> in the channel
of Santiago harbor, on June 3, 1898, it was by no means the equal
of that of Lieutenant Cushing, thirty-four years before.</p>

<p>For his superb work Cushing received a vote of thanks from Congress
and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander. He led a
division of sailors in the second and what proved to be the successful
attack upon Fort Fisher, in January, 1865. It was a desperate
fight and none displayed more heroism than the young officer who
had destroyed the <em>Albemarle</em>.</p>

<p>Hon. <em>J.T. </em>Headley, the biographer of Cushing, in an
article written immediately after the close of the Civil War,
used these words: "Still a young man, he has a bright future before
him, and if he lives will doubtless reach the highest rank in
the navy. Bold, daring and self-collected under the most trying
circumstances&mdash;equal to any emergency&mdash;never unbalanced by an
unexpected contingency, he possesses those great qualities always
found in a successful commander. No man in our navy, at his age,
has ever won so brilliant a reputation, and it will be his own
fault if it is not increased until he has no superior."</p>

<p>And yet Commander Cushing's reputation was not increased nor
was it through any fault of his own. It was not long after the
war that his friends were pained to observe unmistakable signs
of mental unsoundness in the young hero. These increased until
his brain was all askew, and he died in an insane asylum in 1874.</p>
