'T is not the foes that are without<br/>
But those that are within<br/>
That give us battles that we find<br/>
The hardest are to win.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox

</p>
</div>
<p>After the last of his three foolish wishes, Reddy Fox left the
Smiling Pool and headed straight for the Old Pasture for which
he had started in the first place. He wished now that he had gone
straight there. Then he wouldn't have seen the suet tied out of
reach to the branch of a tree in the Old Orchard; he wouldn't
have seen the Bob Whites fly away to safety just as he felt almost
sure of catching one; he wouldn't have seen Billy Mink bring a
fine fish out of the water and eat it right before him. It is
bad enough to be starving with no food in sight, but to be as
hungry as Reddy Fox was and to see food just out of reach, to
smell it, and not be able to get it is,&mdash;well, it is more than
most folks can stand patiently.</p>

<p>So Reddy Fox was grumbling to himself as he hurried to the Old
Pasture and his heart was very bitter. It seemed to him that everything
was against him. His neighbors had food, but he had none, not
so much as a crumb. It was unfair. Old Mother Nature was unjust.
If he could climb he could get food. If he could fly he could
get food. If he could dive he could get food. But he could neither
climb, fly, nor dive. He didn't stop to think that Old Mother
Nature had given him some of the sharpest wits in all the Green
Forest or on all the Green Meadows; that she had given him a wonderful
nose; that she had given him the keenest of ears; that she had
given him speed excelled by few. He forgot these things and was
so busy thinking bitterly of the things he didn't have that he
forgot to use his wits and nose and ears when he reached the Old
Pasture. The result was that he trotted right past Old Jed Thumper,
the big gray Rabbit, who was sitting behind a little bush holding
his breath. The minute Old Jed saw that Reddy was safely past,
he started for his bull-briar castle as fast as he could.</p>

<p>It was not until then that Reddy discovered him. Of course, Reddy
started after him, and this time he made good use of his speed.
But he was too late. Old Jed Thumper reached his castle with Reddy
two jumps behind him. Reddy knew now that there was no chance
to catch Old Jed that day, and for a few minutes he felt more
bitter than ever. Then all in a flash Reddy Fox became the shrewd,
clever fellow that he really is. he grinned.</p>

<p>"It's of no use to try to fill an empty stomach on wishes," said
he.</p>

<p>"If I had come straight here and minded my own business, I'd
have caught old Jed Thumper. Now I'm going to get some food and
I'm not going home until I do."</p>

<p>Very wisely Reddy put all unpleasant thoughts out of his head
and settled down to using his wits and his eyes and his ears and
his nose for all they were worth, as Old Mother Nature had intended
he should.</p>

<p>All through the Old Pasture he hunted, taking care not to miss
a single place where there was the least chance of finding food.
But it was all in vain. Reddy gulped down his disappointment.</p>

<p>"Now for the Big River," said he, and started off bravely.</p>

<p>When he reached the edge of the Big River, he hurried along the
bank until he reached a place where the water seldom freezes.
As he had hoped, he found that it was not frozen now. It looked
so black and cold that it made him shiver just to see it. Back
and forth with his nose to the ground he ran. Suddenly he stopped
and sniffed. Then he sniffed again. Then he followed his nose
straight to the very edge of the Big River. There, floating in
the black water, was a dead fish! By wading in he could get it.</p>

<p>Reddy shivered at the touch of the cold water, but what were
wet feet compared with such an empty stomach as his? In a minute
he had that fish and was back on the shore. It wasn't a very big
fish, but it would stop the ache in his stomach until he could
get something more. With a sigh of pure happiness he sank his
teeth into it and then&mdash;well, then he remembered poor Old Granny
Fox. Reddy swallowed a mouthful and tried to forget Granny. But
he couldn't. He swallowed another mouthful. Poor old Granny was
back there at home as hungry as he was and too stiff and tired
to hunt. Reddy choked. Then he began a battle with himself. His
stomach demanded that fish. If he ate it, no one would be the
wiser. But Granny needed it even more than he did. For a long
time Reddy fought with himself. In the end he picked up the fish
and started for home.</p>
