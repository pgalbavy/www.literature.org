<p>"Mais tout le monde," began the chasseur of the Hôtel des Michetons&mdash;"mais,
monsieur, tout le grand monde&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said I, complacently. "Le grand monde means the great
world; and," I added, "the world is a planet of no unusual magnitude,
inhabited by bipeds whose entire existence is passed in attempting
to get something for nothing."</p>

<p>The chasseur of the Hôtel des Michetons bowed, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"You request me," I continued, "not to forget you when I go away.
Why should I not forget you? Are you historical, are you antique,
are you rococo, are you a Rosacrucian?"</p>

<p>The chasseur, amiably perplexed, twirled his gold-banded cap
between his fingers.</p>

<p>"Have you," I asked, "ever done one solitary thing for me besides
touching your expensive cap?"</p>

<p>The chasseur touched his cap, smiled, and hopefully held out
his large empty hand.</p>

<p>"Go to the devil," I said gently; "it is not for what you have
done but for what you have not done that I give you this silver
piece," and I paid the tribute which I despised myself for paying.
Still, his gay smile and prompt salute are certainly worth something
to see, but what their precise value may be you can only determine
when, on returning to New York, you hear a gripman curse a woman
for crossing the sacred tracks of the Metropolitan Street Railroad
Company. So, with my daughter Dulcima and my daughter Alida, and
with a wagon-load of baggage, I left the gorgeously gilded Hôtel
des Michetons&mdash;for these three reasons:</p>

<p>Number one: it was full of Americans.</p>

<p>Number two: that entire section of Paris resembled a slice of
the Waldorf-Astoria.</p>

<p>Number three: I wanted to be rid of the New York <em>Herald</em>.
Surely somewhere in Paris there existed French newspapers, French
people, and French speech. I meant to discover them or write and
complain to the <em>Outlook</em>.</p>

<p>The new hotel I had selected was called the Hôtel de l'Univers.
I had noticed it while wandering out of the Luxembourg Gardens.
It appeared to be a well situated, modest, clean hotel, and not
only thoroughly respectable&mdash;which the great gilded Hôtel des
Michetons was not&mdash;but also typically and thoroughly French. So
I took an apartment on the first floor and laid my plans to dine
out every evening with my daughters.</p>

<p>They were naturally not favourably impressed with the Hôtel de
l'Univers, but I insisted on trying it for a week, desiring that
my daughters should have at least a brief experience in a typical
French hotel.</p>

<p>On the third day of our stay my daughters asked me why the guests
at the Hôtel de l'Univers all appeared to be afflicted in one
way or another. I myself had noticed that many of the guests wore
court-plaster on hands and faces, and some even had their hands
bandaged in slings.</p>

<p>I thought, too, that the passers-by in the street eyed the modest
hotel with an interest somewhat out of proportion to its importance.
But I set that down to French alertness and inbred curiosity,
and dismissed the subject from my mind. The hotel was pretty clean
and highly respectable. Titled names were not wanting among the
guests, and the perfect courtesy of the proprietor, his servants,
and of the guests was most refreshing after the carelessness and
bad manners of the crowds at the Hôtel des Michetons.</p>

<p>"Can it be possible?" said Alida, as we three strolled out of
our hotel into the Boulevard St. Michel.</p>

<p>"What?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That we are in the Latin Quarter? Why this boulevard is beautiful,
and I had always pictured the Latin Quarter as very dreadful."</p>

<p>"It's the inhabitants that are dreadful," said I with a shudder
as a black-eyed young girl, in passing, gave me an amused and
exceedingly saucy smile.</p>

<p>The "Quarter!" It is beautiful&mdash;one of the most beautiful portions
of Paris. The Luxembourg Gardens are the centre and heart of the
Latin Quarter&mdash;these ancient gardens, with their groves of swaying
chestnuts all in bloom, quaint weather-beaten statues in a grim
semicircle looking out over the flowering almonds on the terrace
to the great blue basin of the fountain where toy yachts battle
with waves almost an inch high.</p>

<p>Here the big drab-colored pigeons strut and coo in the sunshine,
here the carp splash in the mossy fountain of Marie de Medici,
here come the nursemaids with their squalling charges, to sit
on the marble benches and coquette with the red-trousered soldiers,
who are the proper and natural prey of all nursemaids in all climes.</p>

<p>"What is that banging and squeaking?" asked Alida, as we entered
the foliage of the southern terrace. "Not Punch and Judy&mdash;oh,
I haven't seen Punch since I was centuries younger! Do let us
go, papa!"</p>

<p>Around the painted puppet box children sat, open-mouthed. Back
of them crowded parents and nurses and pretty girls and gay young
officers, while, from the pulpit, Punch held forth amid screams
of infantile delight, or banged his friends with his stick in
the same old fashion that delighted us all&mdash;centuries since.</p>

<p>"Such a handsome officer," said Alida under her breath.</p>

<p>The officer in question, a dragoon, was looking at Dulcima in
that slightly mischievous yet well-bred manner peculiar to European
officers.</p>

<p>Dulcima did not appear to observe him.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, that is Monsieur de Barsac, who came over on our ship!"
said Alida, plucking me by the sleeve. "Don't you remember how
nice he was when we were so&mdash;so sea&mdash;miserable? You really ought
to bow to him, papa. If you don't, I will."</p>

<p>I looked at the dragoon and caught his eye&mdash;such a bright, intelligent,
mischievous eye!&mdash;and I could not avoid bowing.</p>

<p>Up he came, sword clanking, white-gloved hand glued to the polished
visor of his crimson cap, and&mdash;the girls were delighted.</p>

<p>Now what do you suppose that Frenchman did? He gave up his entire
day to showing us the beauties of the Rive Gauche.</p>

<p>Under his generous guidance my daughters saw what few tourists
see intelligently&mdash;the New Sorbonne, with its magnificent mural
decorations by Puvis de Chavannes; we saw the great white-domed
Observatory, piled up in the sky like an Eastern temple, and the
beautiful old palace of the Luxembourg. Also, we beheld the Republican
Guards, <em>à cheval</em>, marching out of their barracks on the
Rue de Tournon; and a splendid glittering company of cavalry they
were, with their silver helmets, orange-red facings, white gauntlets,
and high, polished boots&mdash;the picked men of all the French forces,
as far as physique is concerned.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon haze the dome of the Pantheon, towering
over the Latin Quarter, turned to purest cobalt in the sky. Under
its majestic shadow the Boulevard St. Michel ran all green and
gold with gas-jets already lighted in lamps and restaurants and
the scores of students' cafés which line the main artery of the
"Quartier Latin."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Alida, "that it were perfectly proper for us to
walk along those terraces."</p>

<p>Captain de Barsac appeared extremely doubtful, but entirely at
our disposal.</p>

<p>"You know what our students are, monsieur," he said, twisting
his short blond moustache; "however&mdash;if monsieur wishes&#11834;?"</p>

<p>So, with my daughters in the centre, and Captain de Barsac and
myself thrown out in strong flanking parties, we began our march.</p>

<p>The famous cafés of the Latin Quarter were all ablaze with electricity
and gas and colored incandescent globes. On the terraces hundreds
of tables and chairs stood, occupied by students in every imaginable
civilian costume, although the straight-brimmed stovepipe and
the <em>béret</em> appeared to be the favorite headgear. At least
a third of the throng was made up of military students from the
Polytechnic, from Fontainebleau, and from Saint-Cyr. Set in the
crowded terraces like bunches of blossoms were chattering groups
of girls&mdash;bright-eyed, vivacious, beribboned and befrilled young
persons, sipping the petit-verre or Amer-Picon, gossiping, babbling,
laughing like dainty exotic birds. To and fro sped the bald-headed,
white-aproned waiters, balancing trays full of glasses brimming
with red and blue and amber liquids.</p>

<p>Here was the Café d'Harcourt, all a-glitter, with music playing
somewhere inside&mdash;the favorite resort of the medical students
from the Sorbonne, according to Captain de Barsac. Here was the
Café de la Source, with its cascade of falling water and its miniature
mill-wheel turning under a crimson glow of light; here was the
famous Café Vachette, celebrated as the centre of all Latin Quarter
mischief; and, opposite to it, blazed the lights of the "<em>CAFÉ
DES BLEAUS," </em>so called because haunted almost exclusively
by artillery officers from the great school of Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Up the boulevard and down the boulevard moved the big double-decked
tram-cars, horns sounding incessantly; cabs dashed up to the cafés,
deposited their loads of students or pretty women, then darted
away toward the river, their lamps shining like stars.</p>

<p>It was truly a fairy scene, with the electric lights playing
on the foliage of the trees, turning the warm tender green of
the chestnut leaves to a wonderful pale bluish tint, and etching
the pavements underfoot with exquisite Chinese shadows.</p>

<p>"It is a shame that this lovely scene should not be entirely
respectable," said Alida, resentfully.</p>

<p>"Vice," murmured de Barsac to me, "could not exist unless it
were made attractive."</p>

<p>As far as the surface of the life before us was concerned, there
was nothing visible to shock anybody; and, under escort, there
is no earthly reason why decent women of any age should not enjoy
the spectacle of the "<em>BOUL' MICH." </em>on a night in springtime.</p>

<p>An innocent woman, married or unmarried, ought not to detect
anything unpleasant in the St. Michel district; but, alas! what
is known as "Smart Society" is so preternaturally wise in these
piping times o' wisdom, that the child is not only truly the father
of the man, but also his instructor and interpreter&mdash;to that same
man's astonishment and horror. It may always have been so&mdash;even
before the days when our theatres were first licensed to instruct
our children in object lessons of the seven deadly sins&mdash;but I
cannot recollect the time when, as a youngster, I was tolerantly
familiar with the scenes now nightly offered to our children through
the courtesy of our New York theatre managers.</p>

<p>Slowly we turned to retrace our steps, strolling up the boulevard
through the fragrant May evening, until we came to the gilded
railing which encircles the Luxembourg Gardens from the School
of Mines to the Palais-du-Sénat.</p>

<p>Here Captain De Barsac took leave of us with all the delightful
and engaging courtesy of a well-bred Frenchman; and he seemed
to be grateful for the privilege of showing us about over a district
as tiresomely familiar to him as his own barracks.</p>

<p>I could do no less than ask him to call on us, though his devotion
to Dulcima both on shipboard and here made me a trifle wary.</p>

<p>"We are stopping," said I, "at the Hôtel de l'Univers&#11834;"</p>

<p>He started and gazed at me so earnestly that I asked him why
he did so.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the Hôtel de l'Univers?" he repeated, looking from me to
Dulcima and from Dulcima to Alida.</p>

<p>"Is it not respectable?" I demanded, somewhat alarmed.</p>

<p>" &mdash;But&mdash;but perfectly, monsieur. It is, of course, the
very best hotel of <em>that</em> kind&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> kind?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;for the purpose. Ah, monsieur, I had no idea that you came
to Paris for <em>that</em>. I am so sorry, so deeply grieved to
hear it. But of course all will be well&#11834;"</p>

<p>He stopped and gazed earnestly at Dulcima.</p>

<p>"It is not&mdash;not <em>you</em>, mademoiselle, is it?"</p>

<p>My children and I stared at each other in consternation.</p>

<p>"What in heaven's name is the matter with that hotel?" I asked.</p>

<p>Captain de Barsac looked startled.</p>

<p>"Is there anything wrong with the guests there?" asked Dulcima,
faintly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh, no&mdash;only, of course, they are all under treatment&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Under treatment!" I cried nervously. "For what!!!"</p>

<p>"Is it possible," muttered the captain, "that you went to that
hotel not knowing? Did you not notice anything peculiar about
the guests there?"</p>

<p>"They all seem to wear court-plaster or carry their arms in slings,"
faltered Dulcima.</p>

<p>"And they come from all over the world &mdash;Russia, Belgium,
Spain," murmured Alida nervously. "What do they want?"</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" cried De Barsac, radiantly; "then you are not
there for the treatment!"</p>

<p>"Treatment for what?" I groaned.</p>

<p>"Hydrophobia!"</p>

<p>I wound my arms around my shrinking children.</p>

<p>"It is the hotel where all the best people go who come to Paris
for Pasteur's treatment," he said, trying to look grave; but Dulcima
threw back her pretty head and burst into an uncontrollable gale
of laughter; and there we stood on the sidewalk, laughing and
laughing while passing students grinned in sympathy and a cloaked
policeman on the corner smiled discreetly and rubbed his chin.</p>

<p>That evening, after my progeny were safely asleep, casting a
furtive glance around me I slunk off to my old café&mdash;the Café
Jaune. I hadn't been there in over twenty years; I passed among
crowded tables, skulked through the entrance, and slid into my
old corner as though I had never missed an evening there.</p>

<p>They brought me a Bock. As I lifted the icy glass to my lips,
over the foam I beheld Williams, smiling.</p>

<p>"Eh bien, mon vieux?" he said, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"By gad, Williams, this seems natural&mdash;especially with you sitting
next."</p>

<p>"It sure does," he said.</p>

<p>I pointed toward a leather settee. "Archie used to sit over there
with his best girl. Do you remember? And that was Dillon's seat&mdash;and
Smithy and Palmyre&mdash;Oh, Lord! &mdash;And Seabury always had that
other corner."... I paused, lost in happy reminiscences. "What
has become of Jack Seabury?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"The usual."</p>

<p>"Married?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very much."</p>

<p>"Where does he live."</p>

<p>"In Philadelphia."</p>

<p>I mused for a while.</p>

<p>"So he's married, too," I said, thoughtfully. "Well&mdash;it's a funny
life, isn't it, Williams."</p>

<p>"I've never seen a funnier. Seabury's marriage was funny too
&mdash;I mean his courtship."</p>

<p>I looked up at Williams, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Is this one of your professional literary stories?"</p>

<p>"It's a true one. What's the harm in my enveloping it in a professional
glamour?"</p>

<p>"None," I said, resignedly; "go ahead."</p>

<p>"All right, mon vieux."</p>
