<p><em>EIGHTEEN</em></p>

<p>I walked along, got to my club and upstairs into my room peaceably.
A feeling of entire tranquillity had come over me. I rested after
a strife which had issued in a victory whose meaning was too great
to comprehend and enjoy at once. I only knew that it was great
because there seemed nothing more left to do. Everything reposed
within me&mdash;even conscience, even memory, reposed as in death.
I had risen above them, and my thoughts moved serenely as in a
new light, as men move in sunshine above the graves of the forgotten
dead. I felt like a man at the beginning of a long holiday&mdash;an
indefinite space of idleness with some great felicity&mdash;a felicity
too great for words, too great for joy&mdash;at the end. Everything
was delicious and vague; there were no shapes, no persons. Names
flitted through my mind &mdash;Fox, Churchill, my aunt; but they
were living people seen from above, flitting in the dusk, without
individuality; things that moved below me in a valley from which
I had emerged. I must have been dreaming of them.</p>

<p>I know I dreamed of her. She alone was distinct among these shapes.
She appeared dazzling; resplendent with a splendid calmness, and
I braced myself to the shock of love, the love I had known, that
all men had known; but greater, transcendental, almost terrible,
a fit reward for the sacrifice of a whole past. Suddenly she spoke.
I heard a sound like the rustling of a wind through trees, and
I felt the shock of an unknown emotion made up of fear and of
enthusiasm, as though she had been not a woman but only a voice
crying strange, unknown words in inspiring tones, promising and
cruel, without any passion of love or hate. I listened. It was
like the wind in the trees of a little wood. No hate ... no love.
No love. There was a crash as of a falling temple. I was borne
to the earth, overwhelmed, crushed by an immensity of ruin and
of sorrow. I opened my eyes and saw the sun shining through the
window-blinds.</p>

<p>I seem to remember I was surprised at it. I don't know why. Perhaps
the lingering effect of the ruin in the dream, which had involved
sunshine itself. I liked it though, and lay for a time enjoying
the&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;usualness of it. The sunshine of yesterday&mdash;of
to-morrow. It occurred to me that the morning must be far advanced,
and I got up briskly, as a man rises to his work. But as soon
as I got on my legs I felt as if I had already over-worked myself.
In reality there was nothing to do. All my muscles twitched with
fatigue. I had experienced the same sensations once after an hour's
desperate swimming to save myself from being carried out to sea
by the tide.</p>

<p>No. There was nothing to do. I descended the staircase, and an
utter sense of aimlessness drove me out through the big doors,
which swung behind me without noise. I turned toward the river,
and on the broad embankment the sunshine enveloped me, friendly,
familiar, and warm like the care of an old friend. A black dumb
barge drifted, clumsy and empty, and the solitary man in it wrestled
with the heavy sweep, straining his arms, throwing his face up
to the sky at every effort. He knew what he was doing, though
it was the river that did his work for him.</p>

<p>His exertions impressed me with the idea that I too had something
to do. Certainly I had. One always has. Somehow I could not remember.
It was intolerable, and even alarming, this blank, this emptiness
of the many hours before night came again, till suddenly, it dawned
upon me I had to make some extracts in the British Museum for
our "<em>Cromwell</em>." Our Cromwell. There was no Cromwell;
he had lived, had worked for the future&mdash;and now he had ceased
to exist. His future&mdash;our past, had come to an end. The barge
with the man still straining at the oar had gone out of sight
under the arch of the bridge, as through a gate into another world.
A bizarre sense of solitude stole upon me, and I turned my back
upon the river as empty as my day. Hansoms, broughams, streamed
with a continuous muffled roll of wheels and a beat of hoofs.
A big dray put in a note of thunder and a clank of chains. I found
myself curiously unable to understand what possible purpose remained
to keep them in motion. The past that had made them had come to
an end, and their future had been devoured by a new conception.
And what of Churchill? He, too, had worked for the future; he
would live on, but he had already ceased to exist. I had evoked
him in this poignant thought and he came not alone. He came with
a train of all the vanquished in this stealthy, unseen contest
for an immense stake in which I was one of the victors. They crowded
upon me. I saw Fox, Polehampton, de Mersch himself, crowds of
figures without a name, women with whom I had fancied myself in
love, men I had shaken by the hand, Lea's reproachful, ironical
face. They were near; near enough to touch; nearer. I did not
only see them, I absolutely felt them all. Their tumultuous and
silent stir seemed to raise a tumult in my breast.</p>

<p>I sprang suddenly to my feet&mdash;a sensation that I had had before,
that was not new to me, a remembered fear, had me fast; a remembered
voice seemed to speak clearly incomprehensible words that had
moved me before. The sheer faces of the enormous buildings near
at hand seemed to topple forwards like cliffs in an earthquake,
and for an instant I saw beyond them into unknown depths that
I had seen into before. It was as if the shadow of annihilation
had passed over them beneath the sunshine. Then they returned
to rest; motionless, but with a changed aspect.</p>

<p>"This is too absurd," I said to myself. "I am not well." I was
certainly unfit for any sort of work. "But I must get through
the day somehow." To-morrow ... to-morrow.... I had a pale vision
of her face as it had appeared to me at sunset on the first day
I had met her.</p>

<p>I went back to my club&mdash;to lunch, of course. I had no appetite,
but I was tormented by the idea of an interminable afternoon before
me. I sat idly for a long time. Behind my back two men were talking.</p>

<p>"Churchill ... oh, no better than the rest. He only wants to
be found out. If I've any nose for that sort of thing, there's
something in the air. It's absurd to be told that he knew nothing
about it.... You've seen the <em>Hour?</em>" I got up to go away,
but suddenly found myself standing by their table.</p>

<p>"You are unjust," I said. They looked up at me together with
an immense surprise. I didn't know them and I passed on. But I
heard one of them ask:</p>

<p>"Who's that fellow?" ...</p>

<p>"Oh &mdash;Etchingham Granger...."</p>

<p>"Is he queer?" the other postulated.</p>

<p>I went slowly down the great staircase. A knot of men was huddled
round the tape machine; others came, half trotting, half walking,
to peer over heads, under arm-pits.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with that thing?" I asked of one of them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Grogram's up," he said, and passed me. Someone from a point
of vantage read out:</p>

<p>"The Leader of the House (Sir C. Grogram, Devonport) said that...."
The words came haltingly to my ears as the man's voice followed
the jerks of the little instrument "... the Government obviously
could not ... alter its policy at ... eleventh hour ... at dictates
of ... quite irresponsible person in one of ... the daily ...
papers."</p>

<p>I was wondering whether it was Soane or Callan who was poor old
Grogram's "quite irresponsible person," when I caught the sound
of Gurnard's name. I turned irritably away. I didn't want to hear
that fool read out the words of that.... It was like the warning
croak of a raven in an old ballad.</p>

<p>I began desultorily to descend to the smoking-room. In the Cimmerian
gloom of the stairway the voice of a pursuer hailed me.</p>

<p>"I say, Granger! I say, Granger!"</p>

<p>I looked back. The man was one of the rats of the lower journalism,
large-boned, rubicund, asthmatic; a mass of flesh that might,
to the advantage of his country and himself, have served as a
cavalry trooper. He puffed stertorously down towards me.</p>

<p>"I say, I say," his breath came rattling and wheezing. "What's
up at the <em>Hour?</em>"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," I answered curtly.</p>

<p>"They said you took it yesterday. You've been playing the very
devil, haven't you? But I suppose it was not off your own bat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I never play off my own bat," I answered.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't want to intrude," he said again. In the gloom
I was beginning to discern the workings of the tortured apoplectic
face. "But, I say, what's de Mersch's little game?"</p>

<p>"You'd better ask him," I answered. It was incredibly hateful,
this satyr's mask in the dim light.</p>

<p>"He's not in London," it answered, with a wink of the creased
eyelids, "but, I suppose, now, Fox and de Mersch haven't had a
row, now, have they?"</p>

<p>I did not answer. The thing was wearily hateful, and this was
only the beginning. Hundreds more would be asking the same question
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>The head wagged on the mountainous shoulders.</p>

<p>"Looks fishy," he said. I recognised that, to force words from
me, he was threatening a kind of blackmail. Another voice began
to call from the top of the stairs&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Granger! I say, Granger...."</p>

<p>I pushed the folding-doors apart and went slowly down the gloomy
room. I heard the doors swing again, and footsteps patter on the
matting behind me. I did not turn; the man came round me and looked
at my face. It was Polehampton. There were tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I say," he said, "I say, what does it mean; <em>what</em> does
it mean?" It was very difficult for me to look at him. "I tell
you...." he began again. He had the dictatorial air of a very
small, quite hopeless man, a man mystified by a blow of unknown
provenance. "I tell you...." he began again.</p>

<p>"But what has it to do with me?" I said roughly.</p>

<p>"Oh, but <em>you</em> ... you advised me to buy." He had become
supplicatory. "Didn't you, now?... Didn't you.... You said, you
remember ... that...." I didn't answer the man. What had I got
to say? He remained looking intently at me, as if it were of the
greatest moment to him that I should make the acknowledgment and
share the blame&mdash;as if it would take an immense load from his
shoulders. I couldn't do it; I hated him.</p>

<p>"Didn't you," he began categorically; "didn't you advise me to
buy those debentures of de Mersch's?" I did not answer.</p>

<p>"What does it all mean?" he said again. "If this bill doesn't
get through, I tell you I shall be ruined. And they say that Mr.
Gurnard is going to smash it. They are all saying it, up there;
and that you&mdash;you on the <em>Hour</em> ... are ... are responsible."
He took out a handkerchief and began to blow his nose. I didn't
say a single word.</p>

<p>"But what's to be done?" he started again; "what's to be <em>done</em>....
I tell you.... My daughter, you know, she's very brave, she said
to me this morning she could work; but she couldn't, you know;
she's not been brought up to that sort of thing ... not even typewriting
... and so ... we're all ruined ... everyone of us. And I've more
than fifty hands, counting Mr. Lea, and they'll all have to go.
It's horrible.... I trusted you, Granger, you know; I trusted
you, and they say up there that you...." I turned away from him.
I couldn't bear to see the bewildered fear in his eyes. "So many
of us," he began again, "everyone I know.... I told them to buy
and ... But you might have let us know, Granger, you might have.
Think of my poor daughter."</p>

<p>I wanted to say something to the man, wanted to horribly; but
there wasn't anything to say&mdash;not a word. I was sorry. I took
up a paper that sprawled on one of the purple ottomans. I stood
with my back to this haggard man and pretended to read.</p>

<p>I noticed incredulously that I was swaying on my legs. I looked
round me. Two old men were asleep in armchairs under the gloomy
windows. One had his head thrown back, the other was crumpled
forward into himself; his frail, white hand just touched the floor.
A little further off two young men were talking; they had the
air of conspirators over their empty coffee cups.</p>

<p>I was conscious that Polehampton had left me, that he had gone
from behind me; but I don't think I was conscious of the passage
of time. God knows how long I stood there. Now and then I saw
Polehampton's face before my eyes, with the panic-stricken eyes,
the ruffled hair, the lines of tears seaming the cheeks, seeming
to look out at me from the crumple of the paper that I held. I
knew too, that there were faces like that everywhere; everywhere,
faces of panic-stricken little people of no more account than
the dead in graveyards, just the material to make graveyards,
nothing more; little people of absolutely no use but just to suffer
horribly from this blow coming upon them from nowhere. It had
never occurred to me at the time that their inheritance had passed
to me ... to us. And yet, I began to wonder stupidly, what was
the difference between me to-day and me yesterday. There wasn't
any, not any at all. Only to-day I had nothing more to do.</p>

<p>The doors at the end of the room flew open, as if burst by a
great outcry penetrating from without, and a man appeared running
up the room&mdash;one of those men who bear news eternally, who catch
the distant clamour and carry it into quiet streets. Why did he
disturb me? Did I want to hear his news? I wanted to think of
Churchill; to think of how to explain.... The man was running
up the room.</p>

<p>"I say ... I say, you beggars...."</p>

<p>I was beginning to wonder how it was that I felt such an absolute
conviction of being alone, and it was then, I believe, that in
this solitude that had descended upon my soul I seemed to see
the shape of an approaching Nemesis. It is permitted to no man
to break with his past, with the past of his kind, and to throw
away the treasure of his future. I began to suspect I had gained
nothing; I began to understand that even such a catastrophe was
possible. I sat down in the nearest chair. Then my fear passed
away. The room was filling; it hummed with excited voices. "Churchill!
No better than the others," I heard somebody saying. Two men had
stopped talking. They were middle-aged, a little gray, and ruddy.
The face of one was angry, and of the other sad. "He wanted only
to be found out. What a fall in the mud." "No matter," said the
other, "one is made a little sad. He stood for everything I had
been pinning my faith to." They passed on. A brazen voice bellowed
in the distance. "The greatest fall of any minister that ever
was." A tall, heavy journalist in a white waistcoat was the centre
of a group that turned slowly upon itself, gathering bulk. "Done
for&mdash;stood up to the last. I saw him get into his brougham. The
police had a job.... There's quite a riot down there.... Pale
as a ghost. Gurnard? Gurnard magnificent. Very cool and in his
best form. Threw them over without as much as a wink. Outraged
conscience speech. Magnificent. Why it's the chance of his life."
... And then for a time the voices and the faces seemed to pass
away and die out. I had dropped my paper, and as I stooped to
pick it up the voices returned.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Granger ... Etchingham Granger.... Sister is going to marry
Gurnard."</p>

<p>I got on to my hands and knees to pick up the paper, of course.
What I did not understand was where the water came from. Otherwise
it was pretty clear. Somebody seemed to be in a fit. No, he wasn't
drunk; look at his teeth. What did they want to look at his teeth
for; was he a horse?</p>

<hr>
<p>It must have been I that was in the fit. There were a lot of
men round me, the front row on their knees&mdash;holding me, some of
them. A man in a red coat and plush breeches&mdash;a waiter&mdash;was holding
a glass of water; another had a small bottle. They were talking
about me under their breaths. At one end of the horseshoe someone
said:</p>

<p>"He's the man who...." Then he caught my eye. He lowered his
voice, and the abominable whisper ran round among the heads. It
was easy to guess: "the man who was got at." I was to be that
for the rest of my life. I was to be famous at last. There came
the desire to be out of it.</p>

<p>I struggled to my feet.</p>

<p>Someone said: "Feel better now?" I answered: "<em>I&mdash;</em>oh,
I've got to go and see...."</p>

<p>It was rather difficult to speak distinctly; my tongue got in
the way. But I strove to impress the fool with the idea that I
had affairs that must be attended to&mdash;that I had private affairs.</p>

<p>"You aren't fit. Let me...."</p>

<p>I pushed him roughly aside&mdash;what business was it of his? I slunk
hastily out of the room. The others remained. I knew what they
were going to do&mdash;to talk things over, to gabble about "the man
who...."</p>

<p>It was treacherous walking, that tessellated pavement in the
hall. Someone said: "Hullo, Granger," as I passed. I took no notice.</p>

<p>Where did I wish to go to? There was no one who could minister
to me; the whole world had resolved itself into a vast solitary
city of closed doors. I had no friend&mdash;no one. But I must go somewhere,
must hide somewhere, must speak to someone. I mumbled the address
of Fox to a cabman. Some idea of expiation must have been in my
mind; some idea of seeing the thing through, mingled with that
necessity for talking to someone&mdash;anyone.</p>

<p>I was afraid too; not of Fox's rage; not even of anything that
he could do&mdash;but of the sight of his despair. He had become a
tragic figure.</p>

<p>I reached his flat and I had said: "It is I," and again, "It
is I," and he had not stirred. He was lying on the sofa under
a rug, motionless as a corpse. I had paced up and down the room.
I remember that the pile of the carpet was so long that it was
impossible to walk upon it easily. Everything else in the room
was conceived in an exuberance of luxury that now had something
of the macabre in it. It was that now&mdash;before, it had been unclean.
There was a great bed whose lines suggested sinking softness,
a glaring yellow satin coverlet, vast, like a sea. The walls were
covered with yellow satin, the windows draped with lace worth
a king's ransom, the light was softened, the air dead, the sounds
hung slumbrously. And, in the centre of it, that motionless body.
It stirred, pivoted on some central axis beneath the rug, and
faced me sitting. There was no look of inquiry in the bloodshot
eyes&mdash;they turned dully upon me, topaz-coloured in a blood-red
setting. There was no expression in the suffused face.</p>

<p>"You want?" he said, in a voice that was august by dint of hopelessness.</p>

<p>"I want to explain," I said. I had no idea that this was what
I had come for.</p>

<p>He answered only: "You!" He had the air of one speaking to something
infinitely unimportant. It was as if I had no inkling of the real
issue.</p>

<p>With a bravery of desperation I began to explain that I hadn't
stumbled into the thing; that I had acted open-eyed; for my own
ends ... "My own ends." I repeated it several times. I wanted
him to understand, and I did explain. I kept nothing from him;
neither her coming, nor her words, nor my feelings. I had gone
in with my eyes open.</p>

<p>For the first time Fox looked at me as if I were a sentient being.
"Oh, you know that much," he said listlessly.</p>

<p>"It's no disgrace to have gone under to her," I said; "we <em>had</em>
to." His despair seemed to link him into one "we" with myself.
I wanted to put heart into him. I don't know why.</p>

<p>He didn't look at me again.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>that</em>," he said dully, "I &mdash;I understand who
you mean.... If I had known before I might have done something.
But she came of a higher plane." He seemed to be talking to himself.
The half-forgotten horror grew large; I remembered that she had
said that Fox, like herself, was one of a race apart, that was
to supersede us &mdash;Dimensionists. And, when I looked at him
now, it was plain to me that he <em>was</em> of a race different
to my own, just as he had always seemed different from any other
man. He had had a different tone in triumph; he was different
now, in his despair. He went on: "I might have managed Gurnard
alone, but I never thought of her coming. You see one does one's
best, but, somehow, here one grows rather blind. I ought to have
stuck to Gurnard, of course; never to have broken with him. We
ought all to have kept together. &mdash;But I kept my end up as
long as he was alone."</p>

<p>He went on talking in an expressionless monotone, perhaps to
himself, perhaps to me. I listened as one listens to unmeaning
sounds&mdash;to that of a distant train at night. He was looking at
the floor, his mouth moving mechanically. He sat perfectly square,
one hand on either knee, his back bowed out, his head drooping
forward. It was as if there were no more muscular force in the
whole man&mdash;as if he were one of those ancient things one sees
sunning themselves on benches by the walls of workhouses.</p>

<p>"But," I said angrily, "it's not all over, you can make a fight
for it still."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to understand," he answered, "it <em>is</em>
all over&mdash;the whole thing. I ran Churchill and his conscious rectitude
gang for all they were worth.... Well, I liked them, I was a fool
to give way to pity.&mdash;But I did. &mdash;One grows weak among people
like you. Of course I knew that their day was over.... And it's
all <em>over</em>," he said again after a long pause.</p>

<p>"And what will you <em>do</em>?" I asked, half hysterically.</p>

<p>"I don't just know," he answered; "we've none of us gone under
before. There haven't been enough really to clash until she came."</p>

<p>The dead tranquillity of his manner was overwhelming; there was
nothing to be said. I was in the presence of a man who was not
as I was, whose standard of values, absolute to himself, was not
to be measured by any of mine.</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall cut my throat," he began again.</p>

<p>I noticed with impersonal astonishment that the length of my
right side was covered with the dust of a floor. In my restless
motions I came opposite the fireplace. Above it hung a number
of tiny, jewelled frames, containing daubs of an astonishing lewdness.
The riddle grew painful. What kind of a being could conceive this
impossibly barbaric room, could enshrine those impossibly crude
designs, and then fold his hands? I turned fiercely upon him.
"But you are rich enough to enjoy life," I said.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked wearily.</p>

<p>"In the name of God," I shouted, "what do you work for&mdash;what
have you been plotting and plotting for, if not to enjoy your
life at the last?" He made a small indefinite motion of ignorance,
as if I had propounded to him a problem that he could not solve,
that he did not think worth the solving.</p>

<p>It came to me as the confirmation of a suspicion&mdash;that motion.
They had no joy, these people who were to supersede us; their
clear-sightedness did nothing more for them than just that enabling
them to spread desolation among us and take our places. It had
been in her manner all along, she was like Fate; like the abominable
Fate that desolates the whole length of our lives; that leaves
of our hopes, of our plans, nothing but a hideous jumble of fragments
like those of statues, smashed by hammers; the senseless, inscrutable,
joyless Fate that we hate, and that debases us forever and ever.
She had been all that to me ... and to how many more?</p>

<p>"I used to be a decent personality," I vociferated at him. "Do
you hear&mdash;decent. I could look a man in the face. And you cannot
even enjoy. What do you come for? What do you live for? What is
at the end of it all?"</p>

<p>"Ah, if I knew ..." he answered, negligently.</p>
