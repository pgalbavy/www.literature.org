<p>SPANISH JOHNNY had no shop of his own, but he kept a table and an
order-book in one corner of the drug store where paints and wall-paper
were sold, and he was sometimes to be found there for an hour or so
about noon. Thea had gone into the drug store to have a friendly chat
with the proprietor, who used to lend her books from his shelves. She
found Johnny there, trimming rolls of wall-paper for the parlor of
Banker Smith's new house. She sat down on the top of his table and
watched him.
</p><p>“Johnny,” she said suddenly, “I want you to write down the words of that
Mexican serenade you used to sing; you know, 'ROSA DE NOCHE.' It's an
unusual song. I'm going to study it. I know enough Spanish for that.”
</p><p>Johnny looked up from his roller with his bright, affable smile. “SI,
but it is low for you, I think; VOZ CONTRALTO. It is low for me.”
</p><p>“Nonsense. I can do more with my low voice than I used to. I'll show
you. Sit down and write it out for me, please.” Thea beckoned him with
the short yellow pencil tied to his order-book.
</p><p>Johnny ran his fingers through his curly black hair. “If you wish. I do
not know if that SERENATA all right for young ladies. Down there it is
more for married ladies. They sing it for husbands--or somebody else,
may-bee.” Johnny's eyes twinkled and he apologized gracefully with his
shoulders. He sat down at the table, and while Thea looked over his arm,
began to write the song down in a long, slanting script, with highly
ornamental capitals. Presently he looked up. “This-a song not exactly
Mexican,” he said thoughtfully. “It come from farther down; Brazil,
Venezuela, may-bee. I learn it from some fellow down there, and he learn
it from another fellow. It is-a most like Mexican, but not quite.” Thea
did not release him, but pointed to the paper. There were three verses
of the song in all, and when Johnny had written them down, he sat
looking at them meditatively, his head on one side. “I don' think for a
high voice, SENORITA,” he objected with polite persistence. “How you
accompany with piano?”
</p><p>“Oh, that will be easy enough.”
</p><p>“For you, may-bee!” Johnny smiled and drummed on the table with the tips
of his agile brown fingers. “You know something? Listen, I tell you.” He
rose and sat down on the table beside her, putting his foot on the
chair. He loved to talk at the hour of noon. “When you was a little
girl, no bigger than that, you come to my house one day 'bout noon, like
this, and I was in the door, playing guitar. You was barehead, barefoot;
you run away from home. You stand there and make a frown at me an'
listen. By 'n by you say for me to sing. I sing some lil' ting, and then
I say for you to sing with me. You don' know no words, of course, but
you take the air and you sing it justa beauti-ful! I never see a child
do that, outside Mexico. You was, oh, I do' know--seven year, may-bee.
By 'n by the preacher come look for you and begin for scold. I say,
'Don' scold, Meester Kronborg. She come for hear guitar. She gotta some
music in her, that child. Where she get?' Then he tell me 'bout your
gran'papa play oboe in the old country. I never forgetta that time.”
 Johnny chuckled softly.
</p><p>Thea nodded. “I remember that day, too. I liked your music better than
the church music. When are you going to have a dance over there,
Johnny?”
</p><p>Johnny tilted his head. “Well, Saturday night the Spanish boys have a
lil' party, some DANZA. You know Miguel Ramas? He have some young
cousins, two boys, very nice-a, come from Torreon. They going to Salt
Lake for some job-a, and stay off with him two-three days, and he mus'
have a party. You like to come?”
</p><p>That was how Thea came to go to the Mexican ball. Mexican Town had been
increased by half a dozen new families during the last few years, and
the Mexicans had put up an adobe dance-hall, that looked exactly like
one of their own dwellings, except that it was a little longer, and was
so unpretentious that nobody in Moonstone knew of its existence. The
“Spanish boys” are reticent about their own affairs. Ray Kennedy used to
know about all their little doings, but since his death there was no one
whom the Mexicans considered SIMPATICO.
</p><p>On Saturday evening after supper Thea told her mother that she was going
over to Mrs. Tellamantez's to watch the Mexicans dance for a while, and
that Johnny would bring her home.
</p><p>Mrs. Kronborg smiled. She noticed that Thea had put on a white dress and
had done her hair up with unusual care, and that she carried her best
blue scarf. “Maybe you'll take a turn yourself, eh? I wouldn't mind
watching them Mexicans. They're lovely dancers.”
</p><p>Thea made a feeble suggestion that her mother might go with her, but
Mrs. Kronborg was too wise for that. She knew that Thea would have a
better time if she went alone, and she watched her daughter go out of
the gate and down the sidewalk that led to the depot.
</p><p>Thea walked slowly. It was a soft, rosy evening. The sand hills were
lavender. The sun had gone down a glowing copper disk, and the fleecy
clouds in the east were a burning rose-color, flecked with gold. Thea
passed the cottonwood grove and then the depot, where she left the
sidewalk and took the sandy path toward Mexican Town. She could hear the
scraping of violins being tuned, the tinkle of mandolins, and the growl
of a double bass. Where had they got a double bass? She did not know
there was one in Moonstone. She found later that it was the property
of one of Ramas's young cousins, who was taking it to Utah with him
to cheer him at his “job-a.”
</p><p>The Mexicans never wait until it is dark to begin to dance, and Thea had
no difficulty in finding the new hall, because every other house in the
town was deserted. Even the babies had gone to the ball; a neighbor was
always willing to hold the baby while the mother danced. Mrs.
Tellamantez came out to meet Thea and led her in. Johnny bowed to her
from the platform at the end of the room, where he was playing the
mandolin along with two fiddles and the bass. The hall was a long low
room, with whitewashed walls, a fairly tight plank floor, wooden benches
along the sides, and a few bracket lamps screwed to the frame timbers.
There must have been fifty people there, counting the children. The
Mexican dances were very much family affairs. The fathers always danced
again and again with their little daughters, as well as with their
wives. One of the girls came up to greet Thea, her dark cheeks glowing
with pleasure and cordiality, and introduced her brother, with whom she
had just been dancing. “You better take him every time he asks you,” she
whispered. “He's the best dancer here, except Johnny.”
</p><p>Thea soon decided that the poorest dancer was herself. Even Mrs.
Tellamantez, who always held her shoulders so stiffly, danced better
than she did. The musicians did not remain long at their post. When one
of them felt like dancing, he called some other boy to take his
instrument, put on his coat, and went down on the floor. Johnny, who
wore a blousy white silk shirt, did not even put on his coat.
</p><p>The dances the railroad men gave in Firemen's Hall were the only dances
Thea had ever been allowed to go to, and they were very different from
this. The boys played rough jokes and thought it smart to be clumsy and
to run into each other on the floor. For the square dances there was
always the bawling voice of the caller, who was also the county
auctioneer.
</p><p>This Mexican dance was soft and quiet. There was no calling, the
conversation was very low, the rhythm of the music was smooth and
engaging, the men were graceful and courteous. Some of them Thea had
never before seen out of their working clothes, smeared with grease from
the round-house or clay from the brickyard. Sometimes, when the music
happened to be a popular Mexican waltz song, the dancers sang it softly
as they moved. There were three little girls under twelve, in their
first communion dresses, and one of them had an orange marigold in her
black hair, just over her ear. They danced with the men and with each
other. There was an atmosphere of ease and friendly pleasure in the low,
dimly lit room, and Thea could not help wondering whether the Mexicans
had no jealousies or neighborly grudges as the people in Moonstone had.
There was no constraint of any kind there to-night, but a kind of
natural harmony about their movements, their greetings, their low
conversation, their smiles.
</p><p>Ramas brought up his two young cousins, Silvo and Felipe, and presented
them. They were handsome, smiling youths, of eighteen and twenty, with
pale-gold skins, smooth cheeks, aquiline features, and wavy black hair,
like Johnny's. They were dressed alike, in black velvet jackets and soft
silk shirts, with opal shirt-buttons and flowing black ties looped
through gold rings. They had charming manners, and low, guitar-like
voices. They knew almost no English, but a Mexican boy can pay a great
many compliments with a very limited vocabulary. The Ramas boys thought
Thea dazzlingly beautiful. They had never seen a Scandinavian girl
before, and her hair and fair skin bewitched them. “BLANCO Y ORO,
SEMEJANTE LA PASCUA!” (White and gold, like Easter!) they exclaimed to
each other. Silvo, the younger, declared that he could never go on to
Utah; that he and his double bass had reached their ultimate
destination. The elder was more crafty; he asked Miguel Ramas whether
there would be “plenty more girls like that _A_ Salt Lake, maybee?”
</p><p>Silvo, overhearing, gave his brother a contemptuous glance. “Plenty more
A PARAISO may-bee!” he retorted. When they were not dancing with her,
their eyes followed her, over the coiffures of their other partners.
That was not difficult; one blonde head moving among so many dark ones.
</p><p>Thea had not meant to dance much, but the Ramas boys danced so well and
were so handsome and adoring that she yielded to their entreaties. When
she sat out a dance with them, they talked to her about their family at
home, and told her how their mother had once punned upon their name.
RAMA, in Spanish, meant a branch, they explained. Once when they were
little lads their mother took them along when she went to help the women
decorate the church for Easter. Some one asked her whether she had
brought any flowers, and she replied that she had brought her “ramas.”
 This was evidently a cherished family story.
</p><p>When it was nearly midnight, Johnny announced that every one was going
to his house to have “some lil' icecream and some lil' MUSICA.” He began
to put out the lights and Mrs. Tellamantez led the way across the square
to her CASA. The Ramas brothers escorted Thea, and as they stepped out
of the door, Silvo exclaimed, “HACE FRIO!” and threw his velvet coat
about her shoulders.
</p><p>Most of the company followed Mrs. Tellamantez, and they sat about on the
gravel in her little yard while she and Johnny and Mrs. Miguel Ramas
served the ice-cream. Thea sat on Felipe's coat, since Silvo's was
already about her shoulders. The youths lay down on the shining gravel
beside her, one on her right and one on her left. Johnny already called
them “LOS ACOLITOS,” the altar-boys. The talk all about them was low,
and indolent. One of the girls was playing on Johnny's guitar, another
was picking lightly at a mandolin. The moonlight was so bright that one
could see every glance and smile, and the flash of their teeth. The
moonflowers over Mrs. Tellamantez's door were wide open and of an
unearthly white. The moon itself looked like a great pale flower in the
sky.
</p><p>After all the ice-cream was gone, Johnny approached Thea, his guitar
under his arm, and the elder Ramas boy politely gave up his place.
Johnny sat down, took a long breath, struck a fierce chord, and then
hushed it with his other hand. “Now we have some lil' SERENATA, eh? You
wan' a try?”
</p><p>When Thea began to sing, instant silence fell upon the company. She felt
all those dark eyes fix themselves upon her intently. She could see them
shine. The faces came out of the shadow like the white flowers over the
door. Felipe leaned his head upon his hand. Silvo dropped on his back
and lay looking at the moon, under the impression that he was still
looking at Thea. When she finished the first verse, Thea whispered to
Johnny, “Again, I can do it better than that.”
</p><p>She had sung for churches and funerals and teachers, but she had never
before sung for a really musical people, and this was the first time she
had ever felt the response that such a people can give. They turned
themselves and all they had over to her. For the moment they cared about
nothing in the world but what she was doing. Their faces confronted her,
open, eager, unprotected. She felt as if all these warm-blooded people
debouched into her. Mrs. Tellamantez's fateful resignation, Johnny's
madness, the adoration of the boy who lay still in the sand; in an
instant these things seemed to be within her instead of without, as if
they had come from her in the first place.
</p><p>When she finished, her listeners broke into excited murmur. The men
began hunting feverishly for cigarettes. Famos Serranos the barytone
bricklayer, touched Johnny's arm, gave him a questioning look, then
heaved a deep sigh. Johnny dropped on his elbow, wiping his face and
neck and hands with his handkerchief. “SENORITA,” he panted, “if you
sing like that once in the City of Mexico, they just-a go crazy. In the
City of Mexico they ain't-a sit like stumps when they hear that, not-a
much! When they like, they just-a give you the town.”
</p><p>Thea laughed. She, too, was excited. “Think so, Johnny? Come, sing
something with me. EL PARRENO; I haven't sung that for a long time.”
</p><p>Johnny laughed and hugged his guitar. “You not-a forget him?” He began
teasing his strings. “Come!” He threw back his head, “ANOCHE-E-E--”
</p>
<p><strong>“ANOCHE ME CONFESSE CON UN PADRE CARMELITE, Y ME DIO PENITENCIA QUE</strong>
<strong>BESARAS TU BOQUITA.”</strong>
</p><p>(Last night I made confession With a Carmelite father, And he gave me
absolution For the kisses you imprinted.)
</p>
<p>Johnny had almost every fault that a tenor can have. His voice was thin,
unsteady, husky in the middle tones. But it was distinctly a voice, and
sometimes he managed to get something very sweet out of it. Certainly it
made him happy to sing. Thea kept glancing down at him as he lay there
on his elbow. His eyes seemed twice as large as usual and had lights in
them like those the moonlight makes on black, running water. Thea
remembered the old stories about his “spells.” She had never seen him
when his madness was on him, but she felt something tonight at her elbow
that gave her an idea of what it might be like. For the first time she
fully understood the cryptic explanation that Mrs. Tellamantez had made
to Dr. Archie, long ago. There were the same shells along the walk; she
believed she could pick out the very one. There was the same moon up
yonder, and panting at her elbow was the same Johnny--fooled by the same
old things!
</p><p>When they had finished, Famos, the barytone, murmured something to
Johnny; who replied, “Sure we can sing 'Trovatore.' We have no alto, but
all the girls can sing alto and make some noise.”
</p><p>The women laughed. Mexican women of the poorer class do not sing like
the men. Perhaps they are too indolent. In the evening, when the men are
singing their throats dry on the doorstep, or around the camp-fire
beside the work-train, the women usually sit and comb their hair.
</p><p>While Johnny was gesticulating and telling everybody what to sing and
how to sing it, Thea put out her foot and touched the corpse of Silvo
with the toe of her slipper. “Aren't you going to sing, Silvo?” she
asked teasingly.
</p><p>The boy turned on his side and raised himself on his elbow for a moment.
“Not this night, SENORITA,” he pleaded softly, “not this night!” He
dropped back again, and lay with his cheek on his right arm, the hand
lying passive on the sand above his head.
</p><p>“How does he flatten himself into the ground like that?” Thea asked
herself. “I wish I knew. It's very effective, somehow.”
</p><p>Across the gulch the Kohlers' little house slept among its trees, a dark
spot on the white face of the desert. The windows of their upstairs
bedroom were open, and Paulina had listened to the dance music for a
long while before she drowsed off. She was a light sleeper, and when she
woke again, after midnight, Johnny's concert was at its height. She lay
still until she could bear it no longer. Then she wakened Fritz and they
went over to the window and leaned out. They could hear clearly there.
</p><p>“DIE THEA,” whispered Mrs. Kohler; “it must be. ACH, WUNDERSCHON!”
</p><p>Fritz was not so wide awake as his wife. He grunted and scratched on the
floor with his bare foot. They were listening to a Mexican part-song;
the tenor, then the soprano, then both together; the barytone joins
them, rages, is extinguished; the tenor expires in sobs, and the soprano
finishes alone. When the soprano's last note died away, Fritz nodded to
his wife. “JA,” he said; “SCHON.”
</p><p>There was silence for a few moments. Then the guitar sounded fiercely,
and several male voices began the sextette from “Lucia.” Johnny's reedy
tenor they knew well, and the bricklayer's big, opaque barytone; the
others might be anybody over there--just Mexican voices. Then at the
appointed, at the acute, moment, the soprano voice, like a fountain jet,
shot up into the light. “HORCH! HORCH!” the old people whispered, both
at once. How it leaped from among those dusky male voices! How it played
in and about and around and over them, like a goldfish darting among
creek minnows, like a yellow butterfly soaring above a swarm of dark
ones. “Ah,” said Mrs. Kohler softly, “the dear man; if he could hear her
now!”
