"If you please, mum," said the voice of a domestic
from somewhere round the angle of the door, "number three
is moving in.
<P>
Two little old ladies, who were sitting at either
side of a table, sprang to their feet with ejaculations
of interest, and rushed to the window of the
sitting-room.
<P>
"Take care, Monica dear," said one, shrouding herself
in the lace curtain; "don't let them see us.
<P>
"No, no, Bertha.  We must not give them reason to say
that their neighbors are inquisitive.  But I think that
we are safe if we stand like this."
<P>
The open window looked out upon a sloping lawn, well
trimmed and pleasant, with fuzzy rosebushes and a
star-shaped bed of sweet-william.  It was bounded by
a low wooden fence, which screened it off from a broad,
modern, new metaled road.  At the other side of this road
were three large detached deep-bodied villas with peaky
eaves and small wooden balconies, each standing in its
own little square of grass and of flowers.  All three
were equally new, but numbers one and two were curtained
and sedate, with a human, sociable look to them; while
number three, with yawning door and unkempt garden, had
apparently only just received its furniture and made
itself ready for its occupants.  A four-wheeler had
driven up to the gate, and it was at this that the old
ladies, peeping out bird-like from behind their curtains,
directed an eager and questioning gaze.
<P>
The cabman had descended, and the passengers within
were handing out the articles which they desired him to
carry up to the house.  He stood red-faced and blinking,
with his crooked arms outstretched, while a male hand,
protruding from the window, kept piling up upon him a
series of articles the sight of which filled the curious
old ladies with bewilderment.
<P>
"My goodness me!" cried Monica, the smaller, the
drier, and the more wizened of the pair.  "What do you
call that, Bertha?  It looks to me like four batter
puddings."
<P>
"Those are what young men box each other with,"
said Bertha, with a conscious air of superior worldly
knowledge.
<P>
"And those?"
<P>
Two great bottle-shaped pieces of yellow shining wood
had been heaped upon the cabman.
<P>
"Oh, I don't know what those are," confessed Bertha. 
Indian clubs had never before obtruded themselves upon
her peaceful and very feminine existence.
<P>
These mysterious articles were followed, however, by
others which were more within their, range of
comprehension--by a pair of dumb-bells, a purple
cricket-bag, a set of golf clubs, and a tennis racket. 
Finally, when the cabman, all top-heavy and bristling,
had staggered off up the garden path, there emerged in a
very leisurely way from the cab a big, powerfully built
young man, with a bull pup under one arm and a pink
sporting paper in his hand.  The paper he crammed into
the pocket of his light yellow dust-coat, and extended
his hand as if to assist some one else from the vehicle. 
To the surprise of the two old ladies, however, the only
thing which his open palm received was a violent slap,
and a tall lady bounded unassisted out of the cab.  With
a regal wave she motioned the young man towards the door,
and then with one hand upon her hip she stood in a
careless, lounging attitude by the gate, kicking her
toe against the wall and listlessly awaiting the return
of the driver.
<P>
As she turned slowly round, and the sunshine struck
upon her face, the two watchers were amazed to see that
this very active and energetic lady was far from being in
her first youth, so far that she had certainly come of
age again since she first passed that landmark in life's
journey.  Her finely chiseled, clean-cut face, with
something red Indian about the firm mouth and strongly
marked cheek bones, showed even at that distance traces
of the friction of the passing years.  And yet she was
very handsome.  Her features were as firm in repose as
those of a Greek bust, and her great dark eyes were
arched over by two brows so black, so thick, and so
delicately curved, that the eye turned away from the
harsher details of the face to marvel at their grace and
strength.  Her figure, too, was straight as a dart, a
little portly, perhaps, but curving into magnificent
outlines, which were half accentuated by the strange
costume which she wore.  Her hair, black but plentifully
shot with grey, was brushed plainly back from her high
forehead, and was gathered under a small round felt hat,
like that of a man, with one sprig of feather in the band
as a concession to her sex.  A double-breasted jacket of
some dark frieze-like material fitted closely to her
figure, while her straight blue skirt, untrimmed and
ungathered, was cut so short that the lower curve of her
finely-turned legs was plainly visible beneath it,
terminating in a pair of broad, flat, low-heeled and
square-toed shoes.  Such was the lady who lounged at the
gate of number three, under the curious eyes of her two
opposite neighbors.
<P>
But if her conduct and appearance had already
somewhat jarred upon their limited and precise sense of
the fitness of things, what were they to think of the
next little act in this tableau vivant?  The cabman,
red and heavy-jowled, had come back from his labors, and
held out his hand for his fare.  The lady passed him a
coin, there was a moment of mumbling and gesticulating,
and suddenly she had him with both hands by the red
cravat which girt his neck, and was shaking him as a
terrier would a rat.  Right across the pavement she
thrust him, and, pushing him up against the wheel, she
banged his head three several times against the side of
his own vehicle.
<P>
"Can I be of any use to you, aunt?" asked the large
youth, framing himself in the open doorway.
<P>
"Not the slightest," panted the enraged lady. 
"There, you low blackguard, that will teach you to be
impertinent to a lady."
<P>
The cabman looked helplessly about him with a
bewildered, questioning gaze, as one to whom alone of
all men this unheard-of and extraordinary thing had
happened.  Then, rubbing his head, he mounted slowly on
to the box and drove away with an uptossed hand appealing
to the universe.  The lady smoothed down her dress,
pushed back her hair under her little felt hat, and
strode in through the hall-door, which was closed behind
her.  As with a whisk her short skirts vanished into the
darkness, the two spectators--Miss Bertha and Miss Monica
Williams--sat looking at each other in speechless
amazement.  For fifty years they had peeped through that
little window and across that trim garden, but never yet
had such a sight as this come to confound them.
<P>
"I wish," said Monica at last, "that we had kept the
field."
<P>
"I am sure I wish we had," answered her sister.
