<p>It cannot be doubted that the Indian youth intended to make an
assault on Jack Carleton. He must have known of his prostrating
illness and concluded that he was a much less dangerous individual
than when they first met; but there was something in the flash
of the captive's eye and a meaning in the act of drawing his knife
part way from his girdle, which caused the young Sauk to hesitate.
Evidently he concluded that much could be said for and against
the prudence of opening hostilities.</p>

<p>Jack strode forward, with his shoulders thrown back and a scowl,
as though he preferred that the youth should make the attack.
He kept his gaze on the savage until some distance beyond him,
the latter turning as if on a pivot and narrowly watching him
to the very door of the lodge. Jack then withdrew his attention
and took a survey of matters in front.</p>

<p>The same quiet which he had noticed a short time before held
reign. The few Indians moving about paid no attention to the lad,
with the exception, perhaps, of one: that was Ogallah, the chieftain
who had just noticed him on his return from the spring. The noble
head of the band was lolling in the shade of one of the wigwams,
discussing affairs of state with one of his cabinet, when he observed
the youth. Summoning all his latent energy, he rose to his feet
and strolled in the direction of his own home. The moment Jack
saw him, he assumed the most woe-begone appearance it was possible
to wear. The defiant attitude and manner, which were a challenge
of themselves, vanished: the shoulders drooped forward: the step
became slouchy and uncertain, and the poor fellow looked as if
about to sink to the ground in a final collapse.</p>

<p>Pretending not to see the sachem, Jack feebly drew the bison
skin aside and pitched into the lodge. Glancing around, he found
he was alone, whereupon he strode straight across the space, lay
back on his couch, and kicked up his heels like a crowing infant.</p>

<p>"I must work off some of this steam or I shall burst," he said
to himself, rolling and tumbling about in the very abandon of
rapid convalescence: "It's hard work for me to play sick, but
it must be done for the big prize that is at stake."</p>

<p>He kept close watch on the entrance, and, when a hand suddenly
drew the skin aside and the bent figure of the chieftain came
through and straightened up within the lodge, young Carleton had
the appearance of a person whose sands of life were nearly run
out.</p>

<p>Ogallah walked forward and examined him closely. He saw a youth
who was unquestionably a "pale face," staring vacantly at him
for a few seconds, and who then rolled on his face with a groan
that must have been heard some distance beyond the lodge. Restless
flingings of the limbs followed, and, when the sachem turned away,
he must have concluded that it would never be his privilege to
adopt the young gentleman into his family.</p>

<p>Toward night the squaw and dog appeared and the domestic economy
of the aboriginal residence went on as before. When a piece of
cooked meat was brought to Jack, he devoured it with a ferocity
which threatened incurable dyspepsia, and he swallowed a goodly
draught of water freshly brought from the spring.</p>

<p>Recalling the mistake he made while on the journey through the
woods to the village, Jack Carleton resolved he would not fail
through any similar forgetfulness. He fell asleep at that time
on account of his exhaustion, but now the case was different:
he had had enough slumber to last two days, while his brain was
so clear and full of the scheme that it was impossible for him
to rest until after it had been tested.</p>

<p>Nothing is more weary than the waiting which one has to undergo
when placed in his position. The hours drag by with scarcely moving
footsteps, and before the turn of night comes, one is apt to believe
the break of day is at hand. From his couch, Jack furtively watched
how things went, which was much the same as he had seen before.</p>

<p>The pup ate until they would give him no more and then stretched
out at the feet of the squaw, who, having finished her meal, lit
her pipe and puffed away with the dull animal enjoyment natural
to her race. The chief himself led in that respect, and the two
kept it up, as it seemed to Jack, doubly as long as ever before.
At last they lay down and slept.</p>

<p>The captive had noted where his rifle was placed. It leaned against
the side of the lodge where it had stood every time he saw it,
so that, if he could steal out of the place in the night without
arousing the inmates, it would be easy for him to take the gun
with him.</p>

<p>The fire flickered and burned up, then sank, flared up again,
and at last went into a steady decline, which left the room filled
with a dull glow that would have failed to identify the objects
in sight had not the boy been familiar with their appearance.</p>

<p>When convinced that the two were sound asleep, Jack repeated
the prayer that had trembled so many times on his lips, rose as
silently as a shadow, and began moving across the lodge on tip-toes
to where his invaluable rifle leaned. Lightly would that warrior
have need to sleep to be aroused by such faint footfalls.</p>

<p>The boy had not yet reached his weapon, when he was almost transfixed
by the vivid recollection of the attempt he made to get away when
on the journey to the village. He believed his liberty was secured,
when he suddenly awoke to the fact that Ogallah and his warriors
were trifling with him.</p>

<p>Could it be the chief had read in the captive's face the evidence
of his intention?</p>

<p>This was the question which for the moment held life in suspense,
while Jack Carleton stood in the middle of the dimly lit wigwam
and gazed doubtingly toward the figures near the smoldering fire.</p>

<p>"Likely enough he is only pretending he's asleep, and, just as
I am sure the way is clear, he will spring to his feet and grab
me."</p>

<p>It was a startling thought indeed, and there were a few moments
when the lad was actually unable to stir; but he quickly rallied
and smiled at his own fears.</p>

<p>"If I once get my gun in hand, he won't be able to stop me&#11834;"</p>

<p>He was reaching forward to grasp it, when one of the embers fell
apart, and a yellow twist of flame filled the apartment with a
glow which revealed everything. Jack stopped with a faint gasp
and turned his head, sure that the chief was on the point of leaping
upon him; but he was as motionless as a log, and the hand of the
boy was upraised again as he took another stealthy step forward.
A half step more, and his fingers closed around the barrel. The
touch of the cold iron sent a thrill through him, for it was like
the palpable hand of Hope itself.</p>

<p>The powder horn lay on the ground beside the weapon, the Indian
having made no use of either since they came into his possession.
The string was quickly flung over the shoulder of the boy, who
then began moving in the same guarded fashion toward the door,
throwing furtive glances over his shoulder at the king and queen,
who did not dream of what was going on in their palace.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton "crossed the Rubicon" when he lifted the rifle
and powder horn from the ground. Had he been checked previous
to that he would have turned back to his couch, and made the pretense
that what he did was the result of a delirium. But with the possession
of his weapon came a self-confidence that would permit no obstruction
to divert him from his purpose. He would not have fired on the
chief or his squaw (except to save his own life), for that would
have been unpardonable cruelty, but he would have made a dash
into the outer air, where he was sure of eluding his pursuers,
so long as the night lasted.</p>

<p>But the slumber of the couple was genuine. They did not stir
or do anything except to breathe in their sonorous fashion. Jack
took hold of the bison skin to draw it aside, when he found the
door was locked. It was an easy matter, however, to unfasten it,
and a single step placed him outside the wigwam.</p>

<p>Instead of hurrying away, as his impatience prompted him to do,
the youth stood several minutes surveying the scene around him.
The Sauk village was asleep, and the scrutiny which he made of
the collection of wigwams failed to show a single star-like twinkle
of light. The night was clear, and a gibbous moon was high in
the sky. Patches of clouds drifted in front of the orb, and fantastic
shadows whisked across the clearing and over the wigwams and trees.
The dwellings of the Indians looked unsightly and misshapen in
the shifting light, and Jack felt as though he were gazing upon
a village of the dead.</p>

<p>Turning to the southward, he faced the narrow, winding river.
From the front of the chieftain's lodge, he caught the glimmer
of its surface and the murmur of its flow, as it swept by in the
gloom on its way to the distant Gulf. A soft roaring sound, such
as we notice when a sea-shell is held to the ear crept through
the solitude like the voice of silence itself.</p>

<p>Jack was impressed by the scene, but when he saw a shadowy figure
flit between two of the wigwams, and was certain he heard a movement
in the lodge behind him, he hastily concluded it was the time
for action and not meditation. With a start that might have betrayed
him, he quickly left his position and hastened away.</p>

<p>It was natural that the many hours devoted by Jack during his
convalescence, to forming his plan of procedure, should have fixed
the plan he meant to follow. Thus it was that the few minutes
spent in front of the chieftain's lodge were not occupied in debating
the proper course to take, and, when he once made a start, he
went straight ahead without turning to the right or left.</p>

<p>The reader will readily see how great were the advantages on
the side of the fugitive. He was certain of a fair start, which
ought to have made his position absolutely safe, for if the American
Indian is phenomenally skillful in following the trail of an enemy
through the wilderness, that enemy, if he suspects such pursuit,
ought to be able to throw him irrecoverably from the scent.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is scarcely conceivable that the trail of Jack
Carleton could be taken at the door of Ogallah's wigwam and followed
as the warriors trailed a fugitive through the woods; for the
ground whereon he walked had been tramped hard by multitudinous
feet, and the faint impressions of the boy's shoes could not be
individualized among the thousand footprints. It was far different
from fleeing from a camp in the woods, where his trail crossed
and was interfered with by no other, and where the slightest depression
or overturning of the leaves was like the impression on the dusty
highway.</p>

<p>The fugitive's first intention was to take to the woods, and
guiding his course by the moon and sun, travel with all the speed
and push at his command. Fortunately he was enabled to see that
such a course was almost certain to bring disaster. Instead of
doing that, he went directly to the river side, where he had seen
the Indians frolicking in the water, and he himself had so often
sighed for the same delicious privilege.</p>

<p>There were five canoes partly drawn up the bank and waiting the
will of their owner. They were made of bark with curved ends,
fantastically painted, and each was capable of carrying, at least,
six or eight able-bodied warriors. They were so light that the
lad found no trouble in shoving the first clear of the shore,
and sending it skimming out into the stream. As it slackened its
pace, it turned part way round, like a bewildered swan, as if
uncertain which way to go. Then it sailed triangularly down current,
much after the manner of Ogallah's dog when on a trot.</p>

<p>It was not more than fairly under way, when the second glided
out after it, then the third, the fourth and finally the fifth
and last. This contained Jack Carleton who took the long ashen
paddle in hand and began plying it with considerable skill. He
was paying less attention to his own progress than to the manipulation
of the other canoes, which he had set free for a special purpose.</p>

<p>He kept the five in the middle of the current until a fourth
of a mile was passed. Then he gave one such a violent push that
it ran its snout against the bank and stuck fast. Some distance
down stream he repeated the man[oe]uvre with the second boat against
the opposite shore, continuing the curious proceeding until he
was alone in the single canoe, floating down stream.</p>
