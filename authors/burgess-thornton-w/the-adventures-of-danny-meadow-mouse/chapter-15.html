<p><em>WHEN </em>Peter Rabbit, reaching up to nibble the bark of
one of Farmer Brown’s young trees, felt something tugging at one
of his hind legs, he was so startled that he jumped to get away.
Instead of doing this, he fell flat on his face. The thing on
his hind leg had tightened and held him fast. A great fear came
to Peter Rabbit, and lying there in the snow, he kicked and struggled
with all his might. But the more he kicked, the tighter grew that
hateful thing on his leg! Finally he grew too tired to kick any
more and lay still. The dreadful thing that held him hurt his
leg, but it didn’t pull when he lay still.</p>

<p>When he had grown a little calmer, Peter sat up to examine the
thing which held him so fast. It was something like one of the
blackberry vines he had sometimes tripped over, only it was bright
and shiny, and had no branches or tiny prickers, and one end was
fastened to a stake. Peter tried to bite off the shiny thing,
but even his great, sharp front teeth couldn’t cut it. Then Peter
knew what it was. It was wire! It was a snare which Farmer Brown
had set to catch him, and which he had walked right into because
he had been so greedy for the bark of the young peach-tree that
he had not used his eyes to look out for danger.</p>

<p>Oh, how Peter Rabbit did wish that he had not been so curious
to know what Farmer Brown had been doing that day, and that he
had gone straight home as he had meant to do, instead of trying
to get one more meal of young peach-bark! Big tears rolled down
Peter’s cheeks. What should he do? What <em>could</em> he do?
For a long time Peter sat in the moonlight, trying to think of
something to do. At last he thought of the stake to which that
hateful wire was fastened. The stake was of wood, and Peter’s
teeth would cut wood. Peter’s heart gave a great leap of hope,
and he began at once to dig away the snow from around the stake,
and then settled himself to gnaw the stake in two.</p>

<p>Peter had been hard at work on the stake a long time and had
it a little more than half cut through, when he heard a loud sniff
down at the other end of the orchard. He looked up to see—whom
do you think? Why, Bowser the Hound! He hadn’t seen Peter yet,
but he had already found Peter’s tracks, and it wouldn’t be but
a few minutes before he found Peter himself.</p>

<p>Poor Peter Rabbit! There wasn’t time to finish cutting off the
stake. What could he do? He made a frightened jump just as he
had when he first felt the wire tugging at his leg. Just as before,
he was thrown flat on his face. He scrambled to his feet and jumped
again, only to be thrown just as before. Just then Bowser the
Hound saw him and opening his mouth sent forth a great roar. Peter
made one more frantic jump. Snap! the stake had broken! Peter
pitched forward on his head, turned a somersault, and scrambled
to his feet. He was free at last! That is, he could run, but after
him dragged a piece of the stake.</p>

<p>How Peter did run! It was hard work, for you know he had to drag
that piece of stake after him. But he did it, and just in time
he crawled into the old stone wall on one side of the orchard,
while Bowser the Hound barked his disappointment to the moon.</p>
