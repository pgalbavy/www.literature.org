<p>These were happy days in the Green Forest. At least, they were
happy for Lightfoot the Deer. They were the happiest days he had
ever known. You see, he had won beautiful, slender, young Miss
Daintyfoot, and now she was no longer Miss Daintyfoot but Mrs.
Lightfoot. Lightfoot was sure that there was no one anywhere so
beautiful as she, and Mrs. Lightfoot knew that there was no one
so handsome and brave as he.</p>

<p>Wherever Lightfoot went, Mrs. Lightfoot went. He showed her all
his favorite hiding-places. He led her to his favorite eating-places.
She did not tell him that she was already acquainted with every
one of them, that she knew the Green Forest quite as well as he
did. If he had stopped to think how day after day she had managed
to keep out of his sight while he hunted for her, he would have
realized that there was little he could show her which she did
not already know. But he didn't stop to think and proudly led
her from place to place. And Mrs. Lightfoot wisely expressed delight
with all she saw quite as if it were all new.</p>

<p>Of course, all the little people of the Green Forest hurried
to pay their respects to Mrs. Lightfoot and to tell Lightfoot
how glad they felt for him. And they really did feel glad. You
see, they all loved Lightfoot and they knew that now he would
be happier than ever, and that there would be no danger of his
leaving the Green Forest because of loneliness. The Green Forest
would not be the same at all without Lightfoot the Deer.</p>

<p>Lightfoot told Mrs. Lightfoot all about the terrible days of
the hunting season and how glad he was that she had not been in
the Green Forest then. He told her how the hunters with terrible
guns had given him no rest and how he had had to swim the Big
River to get away from the hounds.</p>

<p>"I know," replied Mrs. Lightfoot softly. "I know all about it.
You see, there were hunters on the Great Mountain. In fact, that
is how I happened to come down to the Green Forest. They hunted
me so up there that I did not dare stay, and I came down here
thinking that there might be fewer hunters. I wouldn't have believed
that I could ever be thankful to hunters for anything, but I am,
truly I am."</p>

<p>There was a puzzled look on Lightfoot's face. "What for?" he
demanded. "I can't imagine anybody being thankful to hunters for
anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, you stupid," cried Mrs. Lightfoot. "Don't you see that if
I hadn't been driven down from the Great Mountain, I never would
have found <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"You mean, I never would have found <em>you</em>," retorted Lightfoot.
"I guess I owe these hunters more than you do. I owe them the
greatest happiness I have ever known, but I never would have thought
of it myself. Isn't it queer how things which seem the very worst
possible sometimes turn out to be the very best possible?"</p>

<p>Blacky the Crow is one of Lightfoot's friends, but sometimes
even friends are envious. It is so with Blacky. He insists that
he is quite as important in the Green Forest as is Lightfoot and
that his doings are quite as interesting. Therefore just to please
him the next book is to be Blacky the Crow.</p>
