<p>It was about five months later that Cecil Reeve wrote his long
reply to a dozen letters from Clive Bailey which heretofore had
remained unanswered and neglected:</p>

<p>   "    &mdash;For Heaven's sake, do you think I've nothing to
do except    to write you letters? I <em>never</em> write letters;
and here's the    exception to prove it. And if I were not at
the Geyser Club,    and if I had not dined incautiously, I would
not write this!</p>

<p>   "But first permit me the indiscretion of asking you why an   
engaged man is so charitably interested in the welfare of a   
young girl who is not engaged to him? And if he is    interested,
why doesn't he write to her himself and find out    how she is?
Or has she turned you down?</p>

<p>   "But you need not incriminate and degrade yourself by    answering
this question.</p>

<p>   "Seriously, Clive, you'd better get all thoughts of Athalie   
Greensleeve out of your head as long as you intend to get    married.
I knew, of course, that you'd been hard hit.    Everybody was
gossiping last winter. But this is rather raw,    isn't it?&mdash;asking
me to find out how Athalie is and what she    is doing; and to
write you in detail? Well anyway I'll tell    you once for all
what I hear and know about her and her    family&mdash;her family first,
as I happen to have had dealings    with them. And hereafter you
can do your own philanthropic    news gathering.</p>

<p>   "Doris and Catharine were in a rotten show I backed. And when   
I couldn't afford to back it any longer Doris was ungrateful   
enough to marry a man who cultivated dates, figs, and pecan   
nuts out in lower California, and Catharine has just written   
me a most impertinent letter saying that real men grew only   
west of the Mississippi, and that she is about to marry one   
of them who knows more in half a minute than anybody could   
ever learn during a lifetime in New York, meaning me and    Hargrave.
I guess she meant me; and I guess it's so&mdash;about    Hargrave.
Except for myself, we certainly are a bunch of    boobs in this
out-of-date old town.</p>

<p>   "Now about Athalie,&mdash;she dropped out of sight after you went   
abroad. Nobody seemed to know where she was or what she was   
doing. Nobody ever saw her at restaurants or theatres except   
during the first few weeks after your departure. And then she   
was usually with that Dane chap&mdash;you know&mdash;the explorer. I   
wrote to her sisters making inquiries in behalf of myself and   
Francis Hargrave; but they either didn't know or wouldn't    tell
us where she was living. Neither would Dane. I didn't    suppose
he knew at the time; but he did.</p>

<p>   "Well, what do you think has happened? Athalie Greensleeve
is    the most talked about girl in town! She has become the   
fashion, Clive. You hear her discussed at dinners, at dances,   
everywhere.</p>

<p>   "Some bespectacled guy from Columbia University had an   
article about her in one of the recent magazines. Every paper   
has had something to say concerning her. They all disagree   
except on one point,&mdash;that Athalie Greensleeve is the most   
beautiful woman in New York. How does that hit you, Clive?</p>

<p>   "Well, here's the key to the box of tricks. I'll hand it to   
you now. Athalie has turned into a regular, genuine, out and   
out clairvoyant, trade-marked patented. And society with a   
big <em>S</em> and science with a little <em>s</em> are fighting
to take    her up and make a plaything of her. And the girl is
making    all kinds of money.</p>

<p>   "Of course her beauty and pretty manners are doing most of
it    for her, but here's another point: rumour has it that she's   
perfectly sincere and honest in her business.</p>

<p>   "How can she be, Clive? I ask you. Also I hand it to her   
press-agent. He's got every simp in town on the run. He knows   
his public.</p>

<p>   "Well, the first time I met her she was dining with Dane   
again at the Arabesque. She seemed really glad to see me.    There's
a girl who remains unaffected and apparently    unspoiled by her
success. And she certainly has delightful    manners. Dane glowered
at me but Athalie made me sit down for    a few minutes. Gad!
I was that flattered to be seen with such    a looker!</p>

<p>   "She told me how it began&mdash;she couldn't secure a decent   
position, and all her money was gone, when in came an old guy   
who had patronised the medium whose rooms she was living in.</p>

<p>   "That started it. The doddering old rube insisted that   
Athalie take a crack at the crystal business; she took one,   
and landed him. And when he went out he left a hundred bones   
in his wake and a puddle of tears on the rug.</p>

<p>   "She didn't tell it to me like this: she really fell for the   
old gentleman. But I could size him up for a come-on. The    rural
districts crawl with that species. Now what gets me,    Clive,
is this: Athalie seems to me to be one of the    straightest ever.
Of course she has changed a lot. She's    cleverer, livelier,
gayer, more engaging and bewitching than    ever&mdash;and believe
me she's some flirt, in a sweet,    bewildering sort of way&mdash;so
that you'd give your head to know    how much is innocence and
how much is art of a most    delicious&mdash;and, sometimes, malicious
kind.</p>

<p>   "That's the girl. And that's all she is, just a girl, with   
all the softness and freshness and fragrance of youth still   
clinging to her. She's some peach-blossom, take it from    uncle!
And she is straight; or I'm a million miles away in    the lockup.</p>

<p>   "And now, granted she's morally straight, how <em>can</em>
she be    square in business? Do you get me? It's past me. All
I can    think of is that, being straight, the girl feels herself
that    she's also square.</p>

<p>   "Yet, if that is so, how can she fool others so neatly?</p>

<p>   "Listen, Clive: I was at a dance at the Faithorn's;    tremendous
excitement among pin-heads and débutantes! Athalie    was expected,
professionally. And sure enough, just before    supper, in strolls
a radiant, wonderful young thing making    them all look like
badly faded guinea-hens&mdash;and somehow I get    the impression that
she is receiving her hostess instead of    the contrary. Talk
about self-possession and absolute    simplicity! She had 'em
all on the bench. Happening to catch    my eye she held out her
hand with one of those smiles she can    be guilty of&mdash;just plain
assassination, Clive!&mdash;and I stuck    to her until the pin-heads
crowded me out, and the rubbering    women got my shoulders all
over paint. And now here's where    she gets 'em. There's no curtained
corner, no pasteboard    trophies, no gipsy shawls and bangles,
no lowering of lights,    no closed doors, no whispers.</p>

<p>   "Whoever asks her anything spooky she answers in a sweet and   
natural voice, as though replying to an ordinary question.   
She makes no mystery of it. Sometimes she can't answer, and   
she says so without any excuse or embarrassment. Sometimes   
her replies are vague or involved or even apparently    meaningless.
She admits very frankly that she is not always    able to understand
what her reply means.</p>

<p>   "However she says enough&mdash;tells, reveals, discovers, offers   
sound enough advice&mdash;to make her <em>the</em> plaything of the   
season.</p>

<p>   "And it's a cinch that she scores more bull's eyes than   
blanks. I had a séance with her. Never mind what she told me.   
Anyway it was devilish clever,&mdash;and true as far as I knew.   
And I suppose the chances are good that the whole business   
will happen to me. Watch me.</p>

<p>   "I think Athalie must have cleared a lot of money already.   
Mrs. Faithorn told me she gave her a cheque for five hundred   
that evening. And Athalie's private business must be pretty   
good because all the afternoon until five o'clock carriages   
and motors are coming and going. And you ought to see who's   
in 'em. Your prospective father-in-law was in one! Perhaps he   
wanted inside information about Dominion Fuel&mdash;that damn    stock
which has done a few things to me since I monkeyed with    it.</p>

<p>   "But you should see the old dragons and dowagers and    death-heads,
and frumps who go to see Athalie! And the    younger married bunch,
too. I understand one has to ask for    an appointment a week
ahead.</p>

<p>   "So she must be making every sort of money. And yet she lives   
simply enough&mdash;sky floor of a new office-apartment building   
on Long Acre&mdash;hoisted way up in the air above everything. You   
look out and see nothing but city and river and bay and haze   
on every side as far as the horizon's circle. At night it's   
just an endless waste of electric lights. There's very little   
sound from the street roar below. It's still up there in the   
sky, and sunny; silent and snowy; quiet and rainy; noiseless   
and dark&mdash;according to the hours, seasons, and meteorological   
conditions, my son. And it's some joint, believe me, with the   
dark old mahogany trim and furniture and the dull rich    effects
in azure and gold; and the Beluch carpets full of    sombre purple
and dusky fire, and the white cat on the    window-sill watching
you put of its sapphire blue eyes.</p>

<p>   "And Athalie! curled up on her deep, soft divan, nibbling   
sweetmeats and listening to a dozen men&mdash;for there are    usually
as many as that who drop in at one time or another    after business
is over, and during the evening, unless    Athalie is dining out,
which she often does, damn it!</p>

<p>   "Business hours for her begin at two o'clock in the    afternoon;
and last until five. She could make a lot more    money than she
does if she opened earlier. I told her this,    once, but she
said that she was determined to educate    herself.</p>

<p>   "And it seems that she studies French, Italian, German, piano   
and vocal music; and has some down-and-out old hen read with   
her. I believe her ambition is to take the regular Harvard   
course as nearly as possible. Some nerve! What?</p>

<p>   "Well, that's how her mornings go; and now I've given you,
I    think, a fair schedule of the life she leads. That fellow   
Dane hangs about a lot. So do Hargrave and Faithorn and young   
Allys and Arthur Ensart. And so do I, Clive; and a lot of    others.
Why, I don't know. I don't suppose we'd marry her;    and yet
it would not surprise me if any one of us asked her.    My suspicions
are that the majority of the men who go there    <em>have</em>
asked her. We're a fine lot, we men. So damn    fastidious. And
then we go to sentimental pieces when we at    last get it into
our bone-heads that there is no other way    that leads to Athalie
except by marrying her. And we ask her.    And <em>then</em> we
get turned down!</p>

<p>   "Clive, <em>that</em> girl ought to be easy. To look at her
you'd    say she was made of wax, easily moulded, and fashioned
to be    loved, and to love. But, by God, I don't think it's in
her to    love.... For, if it were&mdash;good night. She'd have raised
the    devil in this world long ago. And some of us would have
done    murder before now.</p>

<p>   "If I had not dined so copiously and so rashly I wouldn't   
write you all this. I'd write a page or two and lie to you,   
politely. And so I'll say this: I really do believe that it   
is in Athalie to love some man. And I believe, if she did    love
him, she'd love him in any way he asked her. He hasn't    come
along yet; that's all. But Oh! how he will be hated when    he
does&mdash;unless he is the marrying kind. And anyway he'll be    hated.
Because, however he does it, he'll get one of the    loveliest
girls this town ever set eyes on. And the rest of    us will realise
it then, and there will be some    teeth-gnashing, believe me!&mdash;and
some squirming. Because the    worm that never dieth will continue
to chew us one and all,    and never, never let us forget that
the girl no man of our    sort could really condescend to marry,
had been asked by    every one of us in turn to marry him; and
had declined.</p>

<p>   "And I'll add this for my own satisfaction: the man who gets   
her, and doesn't marry her, will ultimately experience a    biting
from that same worm which will make our lacerations    resemble
the agreeable tickling of a feather.</p>

<p>   "We're a rotten lot of cowards. And what hypocrites we are!</p>

<p>   "I saw Fontaine sending flowers to his wife. He'd been at   
Athalie's all the evening. There are only two occasions on   
which a man sends flowers to his wife; one of them is when   
he's in love with her.</p>

<p>   "Aren't we the last word in scuts? Custom-ridden,    habit-cursed,
afraid, eternally afraid of something&mdash;of our    own sort always,
and of their opinions. And that offering of    flowers when the
man who sends them hopes to do something of    which he is ashamed,
or has already done it!</p>

<p>   "How I do run on! In <em>vino veritas</em>&mdash;there's some class
to    pickled truth! Here are olives for thought, red peppers
for    honesty, onions for logic&mdash;and cauliflower for constancy&mdash;and   
fifty-seven other varieties, Clive&mdash;all absent in the canned   
make-up of the modern man.</p>

<p>   "'When you and I behind the veil have passed'&mdash;but they don't   
wear veils now; and now is our chance.</p>
