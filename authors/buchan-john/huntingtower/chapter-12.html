<p>Dickson always maintained that his senses did not leave him for
more than a second or two, but he admitted that he did not remember
very clearly the events of the next few hours. He was conscious
of a bad pain above his eyes, and something wet trickling down
his cheek. There was a perpetual sound of water in his ears and
of men's voices. He found himself dropped roughly on the ground
and forced to walk, and was aware that his legs were inclined
to wobble. Somebody had a grip on each arm, so that he could not
defend his face from the brambles, and that worried him, for his
whole head seemed one aching bruise and he dreaded anything touching
it. But all the time he did not open his mouth, for silence was
the one duty that his muddled wits enforced. He felt that he was
not the master of his mind, and he dreaded what he might disclose
if he began to babble.</p>

<p>Presently there came a blank space of which he had no recollection
at all. The movement had stopped, and he was allowed to sprawl
on the ground. He thought that his head had got another whack
from a bough, and that the pain put him into a stupor. When he
awoke he was alone.</p>

<p>He discovered that he was strapped very tightly to a young Scotch
fir. His arms were bent behind him and his wrists tied together
with cords knotted at the back of the tree; his legs were shackled,
and further cords fastened them to the bole. Also there was a
halter round the trunk and just under his chin, so that while
he breathed freely enough, he could not move his head. Before
him was a tangle of bracken and scrub, and beyond that the gloom
of dense pines; but as he could only see directly in front his
prospect was strictly circumscribed.</p>

<p>Very slowly he began to take his bearings. The pain in his head
was now dulled and quite bearable, and the flow of blood had stopped,
for he felt the incrustation of it beginning on his cheeks. There
was a tremendous noise all around him, and he traced this to the
swaying of tree-tops in the gale. But there was an undercurrent
of deeper sound&mdash;water surely, water churning among rocks. It
was a stream&mdash;the Garple of course&mdash;and then he remembered where
he was and what had happened.</p>

<p>I do not wish to portray Dickson as a hero, for nothing would
annoy him more; but I am bound to say that his first clear thought
was not of his own danger. It was intense exasperation at the
miscarriage of his plans. Long ago he should have been with Dougal
arranging operations, giving him news of Sir Archie, finding out
how Heritage was faring, deciding how to use the coming reinforcements.
Instead he was trussed up in a wood, a prisoner of the enemy,
and utterly useless to his side. He tugged at his bonds, and nearly
throttled himself. But they were of good tarry cord and did not
give a fraction of an inch. Tears of bitter rage filled his eyes
and made furrows on his encrusted cheeks. Idiot that he had been,
he had wrecked everything! What would Saskia and Dougal and Sir
Archie do without a business man by their side? There would be
a muddle, and the little party would walk into a trap. He saw
it all very clearly. The men from the sea would overpower them,
there would be murder done, and an easy capture of the Princess;
and the police would turn up at long last to find an empty headland.</p>

<p>He had also most comprehensively wrecked himself, and at the
thought the most genuine panic seized him. There was no earthly
chance of escape, for he was tucked away in this infernal jungle
till such time as his enemies had time to deal with him. As to
what that dealing would be like he had no doubts, for they knew
that he had been their chief opponent. Those desperate ruffians
would not scruple to put an end to him. His mind dwelt with horrible
fascination upon throat-cutting, no doubt because of the presence
of the cord below his chin. He had heard it was not a painful
death; at any rate he remembered a clerk he had once had, a feeble,
timid creature, who had twice attempted suicide that way. Surely
it could not be very bad, and it would soon be over.</p>

<p>But another thought came to him. They would carry him off in
the ship and settle with him at their leisure. No swift merciful
death for him. He had read dreadful tales of the Bolsheviks' skill
in torture, and now they all came back to him&mdash;stories of Chinese
mercenaries, and men buried alive, and death by agonising inches.
He felt suddenly very cold and sick, and hung in his bonds for
he had no strength in his limbs. Then the pressure on his throat
braced him, and also quickened his numb mind. The liveliest terror
ran like quicksilver through his veins.</p>

<p>He endured some moments of this anguish, till after many despairing
clutches at his wits he managed to attain a measure of self-control.
He certainly wasn't going to allow himself to become mad. Death
was death whatever form it took, and he had to face death as many
better men had done before him. He had often thought about it
and wondered how he should behave if the thing came to him. Respectably,
he had hoped; heroically, he had sworn in his moments of confidence.
But he had never for an instant dreamed of this cold, lonely,
dreadful business. Last Sunday, he remembered, he had been basking
in the afternoon sun in his little garden and reading about the
end of Fergus MacIvor in <em>Waverley</em> and thrilling to the
romance of it; and then Tibby had come out and summoned him in
to tea. Then he had rather wanted to be a Jacobite in the '45
and in peril of his neck, and now Providence had taken him most
terribly at his word.</p>

<p>A week ago&#11834;! He groaned at the remembrance of that sunny garden.
In seven days he had found a new world and tried a new life, and
had come now to the end of it. He did not want to die, less now
than ever with such wide horizons opening before him. But that
was the worst of it, he reflected, for to have a great life great
hazards must be taken, and there was always the risk of this sudden
extinguisher.... Had he to choose again, far better the smooth
sheltered bypath than this accursed romantic highway on to which
he had blundered.... No, by Heaven, no! Confound it, if he had
to choose he would do it all again. Something stiff and indomitable
in his soul was bracing him to a manlier humour. There was no
one to see the figure strapped to the fir, but had there been
a witness he would have noted that at this stage Dickson shut
his teeth and that his troubled eyes looked very steadily before
him.</p>

<p>His business, he felt, was to keep from thinking, for if he thought
at all there would be a flow of memories, of his wife, his home,
his books, his friends, to unman him. So he steeled himself to
blankness, like a sleepless man imagining white sheep in a gate....
He noted a robin below the hazels, strutting impudently. And there
was a tit on a bracken frond, which made the thing sway like one
of the see-saws he used to play with as a boy. There was no wind
in that undergrowth, and any movement must be due to bird or beast.
The tit flew off, and the oscillations of the bracken slowly died
away. Then they began again, but more violently, and Dickson could
not see the bird that caused them. It must be something down at
the roots of the covert, a rabbit, perhaps, or a fox, or a weasel.</p>

<p>He watched for the first sign of the beast, and thought he caught
a glimpse of tawny fur. Yes, there it was&mdash;pale dirty yellow,
a weasel clearly. Then suddenly the patch grew larger, and to
his amazement he looked at a human face&mdash;the face of a pallid
small boy.</p>

<p>A head disentangled itself, followed by thin shoulders, and then
by a pair of very dirty bare legs. The figure raised itself and
looked sharply round to make certain that the coast was clear.
Then it stood up and saluted, revealing the well-known lineaments
of Wee Jaikie.</p>

<p>At the sight Dickson knew that he was safe by that certainty
of instinct which is independent of proof, like the man who prays
for a sign and has his prayer answered. He observed that the boy
was quietly sobbing. Jaikie surveyed the position for an instant
with red-rimmed eyes and then unclasped a knife, feeling the edge
of the blade on his thumb. He darted behind the fir, and a second
later Dickson's wrists were free. Then he sawed at the legs, and
cut the shackles which tied them together, and then&mdash;most circumspectly&mdash;assaulted
the cord which bound Dickson's neck to the trunk. There now remained
only the two bonds which fastened the legs and the body to the
tree.</p>

<p>There was a sound in the wood different from the wind and stream.
Jaikie listened like a startled hind.</p>

<p>"They're comin' back," he gasped. "Just you bide where ye are
and let on ye're still tied up."</p>

<p>He disappeared in the scrub as inconspicuously as a rat, while
two of the tinklers came up the slope from the waterside. Dickson
in a fever of impatience cursed Wee Jaikie for not cutting his
remaining bonds so that he could at least have made a dash for
freedom. And then he realised that the boy had been right. Feeble
and cramped as he was, he would have stood no chance in a race.</p>

<p>One of the tinklers was the man called Ecky. He had been running
hard, and was mopping his brow.</p>

<p>"Hob's seen the brig," he said. "It's droppin' anchor ayont the
Dookits whaur there's a beild frae the wund and deep water. They'll
be landit in half an 'oor. Awa' you up to the Hoose and tell Dobson,
and me and Sim and Hob will meet the boats at the Garplefit."</p>

<p>The other cast a glance towards Dickson.</p>

<p>"What about him?" he asked.</p>

<p>The two scrutinised their prisoner from a distance of a few paces.
Dickson, well aware of his peril, held himself as stiff as if
every bond had been in place. The thought flashed on him that
if he were too immobile they might think he was dying or dead,
and come close to examine him. If they only kept their distance,
the dusk of the wood would prevent them detecting Jaikie's handiwork.</p>

<p>"What'll you take to let me go?" he asked plaintively.</p>

<p>"Naething that you could offer, my mannie," said Ecky.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a five-pound note apiece."</p>

<p>"Produce the siller," said the other.</p>

<p>"It's in my pocket."</p>

<p>"It's no' that. We riped your pooches lang syne."</p>

<p>"I'll take you to Glasgow with me and pay you there. Honour bright."</p>

<p>Ecky spat. "D'ye think we're gowks? Man, there's no siller ye
could pay wad mak' it worth our while to lowse ye. Bide quiet
there and ye'll see some queer things ere nicht. C'way, Davie."</p>

<p>The two set off at a good pace down the stream, while Dickson's
pulsing heart returned to its normal rhythm. As the sound of their
feet died away Wee Jaikie crawled out from cover, dry-eyed now
and very business-like. He slit the last thongs, and Dickson fell
limply on his face.</p>

<p>"Losh, laddie, I'm awful stiff," he groaned. "Now, listen. Away
all your pith to Dougal, and tell him that the brig's in and the
men will be landing inside the hour. Tell him I'm coming as fast
as my legs will let me. The Princess will likely be there already
and Sir Archibald and his men, but if they're no', tell Dougal
they're coming. Haste you, Jaikie. And see here, I'll never forget
what you've done for me the day. You're a fine wee laddie!"</p>

<p>The obedient Die-Hard disappeared, and Dickson painfully and
laboriously set himself to climb the slope. He decided that his
quickest and safest route lay by the highroad, and he had also
some hopes of recovering his bicycle. On examining his body he
seemed to have sustained no very great damage, except a painful
cramping of legs and arms and a certain dizziness in the head.
His pockets had been thoroughly rifled, and he reflected with
amusement that he, the well-to-do Mr. McCunn, did not possess
at the moment a single copper.</p>

<p>But his spirits were soaring, for somehow his escape had given
him an assurance of ultimate success. Providence had directly
interfered on his behalf by the hand of Wee Jaikie, and that surely
meant that it would see him through. But his chief emotion was
an ardour of impatience to get to the scene of action. He must
be at Dalquharter before the men from the sea; he must find Dougal
and discover his dispositions. Heritage would be on guard in the
Tower and in a very little the enemy would be round it. It would
be just like the Princess to try and enter there, but at all costs
that must be hindered. She and Sir Archie must not be cornered
in stone walls, but must keep their communications open and fall
on the enemy's flank. Oh, if the police would only come in time,
what a rounding-up of miscreants that day would see!</p>

<p>As the trees thinned on the brow of the slope and he saw the
sky, he realised that the afternoon was far advanced. It must
be well on for five o'clock. The wind still blew furiously, and
the oaks on the fringes of the wood were whipped like saplings.
Ruefully he admitted that the gale would not defeat the enemy.
If the brig found a sheltered anchorage on the south side of the
headland beyond the Garple, it would be easy enough for boats
to make the Garple mouth, though it might be a difficult job to
get out again. The thought quickened his steps, and he came out
of cover on to the public road without a prior reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Just in front of him stood a motor-bicycle. Something had gone
wrong with it for its owner was tinkering at it, on the side farthest
from Dickson. A wild hope seized him that this might be the vanguard
of the police, and he went boldly towards it. The owner, who was
kneeling, raised his face at the sound of footsteps and Dickson
looked into his eyes.</p>

<p>He recognised them only too well. They belonged to the man he
had seen in the inn at Kirkmichael, the man whom Heritage had
decided was an Australian, but whom they now knew to be their
arch-enemy&mdash;the man called Paul who had persecuted the Princess
for years and whom alone of all beings on earth she feared. He
had been expected before, but had arrived now in the nick of time
while the brig was casting anchor. Saskia had said that he had
a devil's brain, and Dickson, as he stared at him, saw a fiendish
cleverness in his straight brows and a remorseless cruelty in
his stiff jaw and his pale eyes.</p>

<p>He achieved the bravest act of his life. Shaky and dizzy as he
was, with freedom newly opened to him and the mental torments
of his captivity still an awful recollection, he did not hesitate.
He saw before him the villain of the drama, the one man that stood
between the Princess and peace of mind. He regarded no consequences,
gave no heed to his own fate, and thought only how to put his
enemy out of action. There was a big spanner lying on the ground.
He seized it and with all his strength smote at the man's face.</p>

<p>The motor-cyclist, kneeling and working hard at his machine,
had raised his head at Dickson's approach and beheld a wild apparition&mdash;a
short man in ragged tweeds, with a bloody brow and long smears
of blood on his cheeks. The next second he observed the threat
of attack, and ducked his head so that the spanner only grazed
his scalp. The motor-bicycle toppled over, its owner sprang to
his feet, and found the short man, very pale and gasping, about
to renew the assault. In such a crisis there was no time for inquiry,
and the cyclist was well trained in self-defence. He leaped the
prostrate bicycle, and before his assailant could get in a blow
brought his left fist into violent contact with his chin. Dickson
tottered back a step or two and then subsided among the bracken.</p>

<p>He did not lose his senses, but he had no more strength in him.
He felt horribly ill, and struggled in vain to get up. The cyclist,
a gigantic figure, towered above him. "Who the devil are you?"
he was asking. "What do you mean by it?"</p>

<p>Dickson had no breath for words, and knew that if he tried to
speak he would be very sick. He could only stare up like a dog
at the angry eyes. Angry beyond question they were, but surely
not malevolent. Indeed, as they looked at the shameful figure
on the ground, amusement filled them. The face relaxed into a
smile.</p>

<p>"Who on earth are you?" the voice repeated. And then into it
came recognition. "I've seen you before. I believe you're the
little man I saw last week at the Black Bull. Be so good as to
explain why you want to murder me?"</p>

<p>Explanation was beyond Dickson, but his conviction was being
wofully shaken. Saskia had said her enemy was as beautiful as
a devil&mdash;he remembered the phrase, for he had thought it ridiculous.
This man was magnificent, but there was nothing devilish in his
lean grave face.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" the voice was asking.</p>

<p>"Tell me yours first," Dickson essayed to stutter between spasms
of nausea.</p>

<p>"My name is Alexander Nicholson," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Then you're no' the man." It was a cry of wrath and despair.</p>

<p>"You're a very desperate little chap. For whom had I the honour
to be mistaken?"</p>

<p>Dickson had now wriggled into a sitting position and had clasped
his hands above his aching head.</p>

<p>"I thought you were a Russian, name of Paul," he groaned.</p>

<p>"Paul! Paul who?"</p>

<p>"Just Paul. A Bolshevik and an awful bad lot."</p>

<p>Dickson could not see the change which his words wrought in the
other's face. He found himself picked up in strong arms and carried
to a bog-pool where his battered face was carefully washed, his
throbbing brows laved, and a wet handkerchief bound over them.
Then he was given brandy in the socket of a flask, which eased
his nausea. The cyclist ran his bicycle to the roadside, and found
a seat for Dickson behind the turf-dyke of the old bucht.</p>

<p>"Now you are going to tell me everything," he said. "If the Paul
who is your enemy is the Paul I think him, then we are allies."</p>

<p>But Dickson did not need this assurance. His mind had suddenly
received a revelation. The Princess had expected an enemy, but
also a friend. Might not this be the long-awaited friend, for
whose sake she was rooted to Huntingtower with all its terrors?</p>

<p>"Are you sure you name's no' Alexis?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In my own country I was called Alexis Nicolaevitch, for I am
a Russian. But for some years I have made my home with your folk,
and I call myself Alexander Nicholson, which is the English form.
Who told you about Alexis?"</p>

<p>"Give me your hand," said Dickson shamefacedly. "Man, she's been
looking for you for weeks. You're terribly behind the fair."</p>

<p>"She!" he cried. "For God's sake tell me all you know."</p>

<p>"Ay, she&mdash;the Princess. But what are we havering here for? I
tell you at this moment she's somewhere down about the old Tower,
and there's boatloads of blagyirds landing from the sea. Help
me up, man, for I must be off. The story will keep. Losh, it's
very near the darkening. If you're Alexis, you're just about in
time for a battle."</p>

<p>But Dickson on his feet was but a frail creature. He was still
deplorably giddy, and his legs showed an unpleasing tendency to
crumple. "I'm fair done," he moaned. "You see, I've been tied
up all day to a tree and had two sore bashes on my head. Get you
on that bicycle and hurry on, and I'll hirple after you the best
I can. I'll direct you the road, and if you're lucky you'll find
a Die-Hard about the village. Away with you, man, and never mind
me."</p>

<p>"We go together," said the other quietly. "You can sit behind
me and hang on to my waist. Before you turned up I had pretty
well got the thing in order."</p>

<p>Dickson in a fever of impatience sat by while the Russian put
the finishing touches to the machine, and as well as his anxiety
allowed put him in possession of the main facts of the story.
He told of how he and Heritage had come to Dalquharter, of the
first meeting with Saskia, of the trip to Glasgow with the jewels,
of the exposure of Loudon the factor, of last night's doings in
the House, and of the journey that morning to the Mains of Garple.
He sketched the figures on the scene &mdash;Heritage and Sir Archie,
Dobson and his gang, the Gorbals Die-Hards. He told of the enemy's
plans so far as he knew them.</p>

<p>"Looked at from a business point of view," he said, "the situation's
like this. There's Heritage in the Tower, with Dobson, Léon and
Spidel sitting round him. Somewhere about the place there's the
Princess and Sir Archibald and three men with guns from the Mains.
Dougal and his five laddies are running loose in the policies.
And there's four tinklers and God knows how many foreign ruffians
pushing up from the Garplefoot, and a brig lying waiting to carry
off the ladies. Likewise there's the police, somewhere on the
road, though the dear kens when they'll turn up. It's awful the
incompetence of our Government, and the rates and taxes that high!...
And there's you and me by this roadside, and I'm no more use than
a tattie-bogle.... That's the situation, and the question is what's
our plan to be? We must keep the blagyirds in play till the police
come, and at the same time we must keep the Princess out of danger.
That's why I'm wanting back, for they've sore need of a business
head. Yon Sir Archibald's a fine fellow, but I doubt he'll be
a bit rash, and the Princess is no' to hold or bind. Our first
job is to find Dougal and get a grip of the facts."</p>

<p>"I am going to the Princess," said the Russian.</p>

<p>"Ay, that'll be best. You'll be maybe able to manage her, for
you'll be well acquaint."</p>

<p>"She is my kinswoman. She is also my affianced wife."</p>

<p>"Keep us!" Dickson exclaimed, with a doleful thought of Heritage.
"What ailed you then no' to look after her better?"</p>

<p>"We have been long separated, because it was her will. She had
work to do and disappeared from me, though I searched all Europe
for her. Then she sent me word, when the danger became extreme,
and summoned me to her aid. But she gave me poor directions, for
she did not know her own plans very clearly. She spoke of a place
called Darkwater, and I have been hunting half Scotland for it.
It was only last night that I heard of Dalquharter and guessed
that that might be the name. But I was far down in Galloway, and
have ridden fifty miles to-day."</p>

<p>"It's a queer thing, but I wouldn't take you for a Russian."</p>

<p>Alexis finished his work and put away his tools. "For the present,"
he said, "I am an Englishman, till my country comes again to her
senses. Ten years ago I left Russia, for I was sick of the foolishness
of my class and wanted a free life in a new world. I went to Australia
and made good as an engineer. I am a partner in a firm which is
pretty well known even in Britain. When war broke out I returned
to fight for my people, and when Russia fell out of the war, I
joined the Australians in France and fought with them till the
Armistice. And now I have only one duty left, to save the Princess
and take her with me to my new home till Russia is a nation once
more."</p>

<p>Dickson whistled joyfully. "So Mr. Heritage was right. He aye
said you were an Australian.... And you're a business man! That's
grand hearing and puts my mind at rest. You must take charge of
the party at the House, for Sir Archibald's a daft young lad and
Mr. Heritage is a poet. I thought I would have to go myself, but
I doubt I would just be a hindrance with my dwaibly legs. I'd
be better outside, watching for the police.... Are you ready,
sir?"</p>

<p>Dickson not without difficulty perched himself astride the luggage
carrier, firmly grasping the rider round the middle. The machine
started, but it was evidently in a bad way, for it made poor going
till the descent towards the main Auchenlochan road. On the slope
it warmed up and they crossed the Garple bridge at a fair pace.
There was to be no pleasant April twilight, for the stormy sky
had already made dusk, and in a very little the dark would fall.
So sombre was the evening that Dickson did not notice a figure
in the shadow of the roadside pines till it whistled shrilly on
its fingers. He cried on Alexis to stop, and, this being accomplished
with some suddenness, fell off at Dougal's feet.</p>

<p>"What's the news?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Dougal glanced at Alexis and seemed to approve his looks.</p>

<p>"Napoleon has just reported that three boatloads, making either
twenty-three or twenty-four men&mdash;they were gey ill to count&mdash;has
landed at Garplefit and is makin' their way to the auld Tower.
The tinklers warned Dobson and soon it'll be a' bye wi' Heritage."</p>

<p>"The Princess is not there?" was Dickson's anxious inquiry.</p>

<p>"Na, na. Heritage is there his lone. They were for joinin' him,
but I wouldn't let them. She came wi' a man they call Sir Erchibald
and three gemkeepers wi' guns. I stoppit their cawr up the road
and tell't them the lie o' the land. Yon Sir Erchibald has poor
notions o' strawtegy. He was for bangin' into the auld Tower straight
away and shootin' Dobson if he tried to stop them. 'Havers,' say
I, 'let them break their teeth on the Tower, thinkin' the leddy's
inside, and that'll give us time, for Heritage is no' the lad
to surrender in a hurry.'"</p>

<p>"Where are they now?"</p>

<p>"In the Hoose o' Dalquharter, and a sore job I had gettin' them
in. We've shifted our base again, without the enemy suspectin'."</p>

<p>"Any word of the police?"</p>

<p>"The polis!" and Dougal spat cynically. "It seems they're a dour
crop to shift. Sir Erchibald was sayin' that him and the lassie
had been to the Chief Constable, but the man was terrible auld
and slow. They convertit him, but he threepit that it would take
a long time to collect his men and that there was no danger o'
the brig landin' afore night. He's wrong there onyway, for they're
landit."</p>

<p>"Dougal," said Dickson, "you've heard the Princess speak of a
friend she was expecting here called Alexis. This is him. You
can address him as Mr. Nicholson. Just arrived in the nick of
time. You must get him into the House, for he's the best right
to be beside the lady.... Jaikie would tell you that I've been
sore mishandled the day, and am no' very fit for a battle. But
Mr. Nicholson's a business man and he'll do as well. You're keeping
the Die-Hards outside, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Ay. Thomas Yownie's in charge, and Jaikie will be in and out
with orders. They've instructions to watch for the polis, and
keep an eye on the Garplefit. It's a mortal long front to hold,
but there's no other way. I must be in the Hoose mysel'. Thomas
Yownie's headquarters is the auld wife's hen-hoose."</p>

<p>At that moment in a pause of the gale came the far-borne echo
of a shot.</p>

<p>"Pistol," said Alexis.</p>

<p>"Heritage," said Dougal. "Trade will be gettin' brisk with him.
Start your machine and I'll hang on ahint. We'll try the road
by the West Lodge."</p>

<p>Presently the pair disappeared in the dusk, the noise of the
engine was swallowed up in the wild orchestra of the wind, and
Dickson hobbled towards the village in a state of excitement which
made him oblivious of his wounds. That lonely pistol shot was,
he felt, the bell to ring up the curtain on the last act of the
play.</p>
