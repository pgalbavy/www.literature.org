<P>
THE opportunity I wanted presented itself in a curious way, and
led, unexpectedly enough, to some rather important consequences.
<P>
I have already stated, among the other branches of human
attainment which I acquired at the public school, that I learned
to draw caricatures of the masters who were so obliging as to
educate me. I had a natural faculty for this useful department of
art. I improved it greatly by practice in secret after I left
school, and I ended by making it a source of profit and pocket
money to me when I entered the medical profession. What was I to
do? I could not expect for years to make a halfpenny, as a
physician. My genteel walk in life led me away from all immediate
sources of emolument, and my father could only afford to give me
an allowance which was too preposterously small to be mentioned.
I had helped myself surreptitiously to pocket-money at school, by
selling my caricatures, and I was obliged to repeat the process
at home!
<P>
At the time of which I write, the Art of Caricature was just
approaching the close of its colored and most extravagant stage
of development. The subtlety and truth to Nature required for the
pursuit of it now, had hardly begun to be thought of then. Sheer
farce and coarse burlesque, with plenty of color for the money,
still made up the sum of what the public of those days wanted. I
was first assured of my capacity for the production of these
requisites, by a medical friend of the ripe critical age of
nineteen. He knew a print-publisher, and enthusiastically showed
him a portfolio full of my sketches, taking care at my request
not to mention my name. Rather to my surprise (for I was too
conceited to be greatly amazed by the circumstance), the
publisher picked out a few of the best of my wares, and boldly
bought them of me-- of course, at his own price. From that time I
became, in an anonymous way, one of the young buccaneers of
British Caricature; cruising about here, there and everywhere, at
all my intervals of spare time, for any prize in the shape of a
subject which it was possible to pick up. Little did my
highly-connected mother think that, among the colored prints in
the shop-window, which disrespectfully illustrated the public and
private proceedings of distinguished individuals, certain
specimens bearing the classic signature of "Thersites Junior,"
were produced from designs furnished by her studious and medical
son. Little did my respectable father imagine when, with great
difficulty and vexation, he succeeded in getting me now and then
smuggled, along with himself, inside the pale of fashionable
society--that he was helping me to study likenesses which were
destined under my reckless treatment to make the public laugh at
some of his most august patrons, and to fill the pockets of his
son with professional fees, never once dreamed of in his
philosophy.
<P>
For more than a year I managed, unsuspected, to keep the Privy
Purse fairly supplied by the exercise of my caricaturing
abilities. But the day of detection was to come.
<P>
Whether my medical friend's admiration of my satirical sketches
led him into talking about them in public with too little
reserve; or whether the servants at home found private means of
watching me in my moments of Art-study, I know not: but that some
one betrayed me, and that the discovery of my illicit manufacture
of caricatures was actually communicated even to the
grandmotherly head and fount of the family honor, is a most
certain and lamentable matter of fact. One morning my father
received a letter from Lady Malkinshaw herself, informing him, in
a handwriting crooked with poignant grief, and blotted at every
third word by the violence of virtuous indignation, that
"Thersites Junior" was his own son, and that, in one of the last
of the "ribald's" caricatures her own venerable features were
unmistakably represented as belonging to the body of a large owl!
<P>
Of course, I laid my hand on my heart and indignantly denied
everything. Useless. My original model for the owl had got proofs
of my guilt that were not to be resisted.
<P>
The doctor, ordinarily the most mellifluous and self-possessed of
men, flew into a violent, roaring, cursing passion, on this
occasion--declared that I was imperiling the honor and standing
of the family--insisted on my never drawing another caricature,
either for public or private purposes, as long as I lived; and
ordered me to go forthwith and ask pardon of Lady Malkinshaw in
the humblest terms that it was possible to select. I answered
dutifully that I was quite ready to obey, on the condition that
he should reimburse me by a trebled allowance for what I should
lose by giving up the Art of Caricature, or that Lady Malkinshaw
should confer on me the appointment of physician-in-waiting on
her, with a handsome salary attached. These extremely moderate
stipulations so increased my father's anger, that he asserted,
with an unmentionably vulgar oath, his resolution to turn me out
of doors if I did not do as he bid me, without daring to hint at
any conditions whatsoever. I bowed, and said that I would save
him the exertion of turning me out of doors, by going of my own
accord. He shook his fist at me; after which it obviously became
my duty, as a member of a gentlemanly and peaceful profession, to
leave the room. The same evening I left the house, and I have
never once given the clumsy and expensive footman the trouble of
answering the door to me since that time.
<P>
I have reason to believe that my exodus from home was, on the
whole, favorably viewed by my mother, as tending to remove any
possibility of my bad character and conduct interfering with my
sister's advancement in life.
<P>
By dint of angling with great dexterity and patience, under the
direction of both her parents, my handsome sister Annabella had
succeeded in catching an eligible husband, in the shape of a
wizen, miserly, mahogany-colored man, turned fifty, who had made
a fortune in the West Indies. His name was Batterbury; he had
been dried up under a tropical sun, so as to look as if he would
keep for ages; he had two subjects of conversation, the
yellow-fever and the advantage of walking exercise: and he was
barbarian enough to take a violent dislike to me. He had proved a
very delicate fish to hook; and, even when Annabella had caught
him, my father and mother had great difficulty in landing
him--principally, they were good enough to say, in consequence of
my presence on the scene. Hence the decided advantage of my
removal from home. It is a very pleasant reflection to me, now,
to remember how disinterestedly I studied the good of my family
in those early days.
<P>
Abandoned entirely to my own resources, I naturally returned to
the business of caricaturing with renewed ardor.
<P>
About this time Thersites Junior really began to make something
like a reputation, and to walk abroad habitually with a bank-note
comfortably lodged among the other papers in his pocketbook. For
a year I lived a gay and glorious life in some of the freest
society in London; at the end of that time, my tradesmen, without
any provocation on my part, sent in their bills. I found myself
in the very absurd position of having no money to pay them, and
told them all so with the frankness which is one of the best
sides of my character. They received my advances toward a better
understanding with brutal incivility, and treated me soon
afterward with a want of confidence which I may forgive, but can
never forget. One day, a dirty stranger touched me on the
shoulder, and showed me a dirty slip of paper which I at first
presumed to be his card. Before I could tell him what a vulgar
document it looked like, two more dirty strangers put me into a
hackney coach. Before I could prove to them that this proceeding
was a gross infringement on the liberties of the British subject,
I found myself lodged within the walls of a prison.
<P>
Well! and what of that? Who am I that I should object to being in
prison, when so many of the royal personages and illustrious
characters of history have been there before me? Can I not carry
on my vocation in greater comfort here than I could in my
father's house? Have I any anxieties outside these walls? No: for
my beloved sister is married--the family net has landed Mr.
Batterbury at last. No: for I read in the paper the other day,
that Doctor Softly (doubtless through the interest of Lady
Malkinshaw) has been appointed the
King's-Barber-Surgeon's-Deputy-Consulting Physician. My relatives
are comfortable in their sphere--let me proceed forthwith to make
myself comfortable in mine. Pen, ink, and paper, if you please,
Mr. Jailer: I wish to write to my esteemed publisher.
<P>
<P>
<P>
"DEAR SIR--Please advertise a series of twelve Racy Prints, from
my fertile pencil, entitled, 'Scenes of Modern Prison Life,' by
Thersites Junior. The two first designs will be ready by the end
of the week, to be paid for on delivery, according to the terms
settled between us for my previous publications of the same size.
<P>
"With great regard and esteem, faithfully yours,
<P>
FRANK SOFTLY."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Having thus provided for my support in prison, I was enabled to
introduce myself to my fellow-debtors, and to study character for
the new series of prints, on the very first day of my
incarceration, with my mind quite at ease.
<P>
If the reader desires to make acquaintance with the associates of
my captivity, I must refer him to "Scenes of Modern Prison Life,"
by Thersites Junior, now doubtless extremely scarce, but
producible to the demands of patience and perseverance, I should
imagine, if anybody will be so obliging as to pass a week or so
over the catalogue of the British Museum. My fertile pencil has
delineated the characters I met with, at that period of my life,
with a force and distinctness which my pen cannot hope to
rival--has portrayed them all more or less prominently, with the
one solitary exception of a prisoner called Gentleman Jones. The
reasons why I excluded him from my portrait-gallery are so
honorab le to both of us, that I must ask permission briefly to
record them.
<P>
My fellow-captives soon discovered that I was studying their
personal peculiarities for my own advantage and for the public
amusement. Some thought the thing a good joke; some objected to
it, and quarreled with me. Liberality in the matter of liquor and
small loans, reconciled a large proportion of the objectors to
their fate; the sulky minority I treated with contempt, and
scourged avengingly with the smart lash of caricature. I was at
that time probably the most impudent man of my age in all
England, and the common flock of jail-birds quailed before the
magnificence of my assurance. One prisoner only set me and my
pencil successfully at defiance. That prisoner was Gentleman
Jones.
<P>
He had received his name from the suavity of his countenance, the
inveterate politeness of his language, and the unassailable
composure of his manner. He was in the prime of life, but very
bald--had been in the army and the coal trade--wore very stiff
collars and prodigiously long wristbands--seldom laughed, but
talked with remarkable glibness, and was never known to lose his
temper under the most aggravating circumstances of prison
existence.
<P>
He abstained from interfering with me and my studies, until it
was reported in our society, that in the sixth print of my
series, Gentleman Jones, highly caricatured, was to form one of
the principal figures. He then appealed to me personally and
publicly, on the racket-ground, in the following terms:
<P>
"Sir," said he, with his usual politeness and his unwavering
smile, "you will greatly oblige me by not caricaturing my
personal peculiarities. I am so unfortunate as not to possess a
sense of humor; and if you did my likeness, I am afraid I should
not see the joke of it."
<P>
"Sir," I returned, with my customary impudence, "it is not of the
slightest importance whether <i>you</i> see the joke of it or not. The
public will--and that is enough for me."
<P>
With that civil speech, I turned on my heel; and the prisoners
near all burst out laughing. Gentleman Jones, not in the least
altered or ruffled, smoothed down his wristbands, smiled, and
walked away.
<P>
The same evening I was in my room alone, designing the new print,
when there came a knock at the door, and Gentleman Jones walked
in. I got up, and asked what the devil he wanted. He smiled, and
turned up his long wristbands.
<P>
"Only to give you a lesson in politeness," said Gentleman Jones.
<P>
"What do you mean, sir? How dare you--?"
<P>
The answer was a smart slap on the face. I instantly struck out
in a state of fury--was stopped with great neatness--and received
in return a blow on the head, which sent me down on the carpet
half stunned, and too giddy to know the difference between the
floor and the ceiling.
<P>
"Sir," said Gentleman Jones, smoothing down his wristbands again,
and addressing me blandly as I lay on the floor, "I have the
honor to inform you that you have now received your first lesson
in politeness. Always be civil to those who are civil to you. The
little matter of the caricature we will settle on a future
occasion. I wish you good-evening."
<P>
The noise of my fall had been heard by the other occupants of
rooms on my landing. Most fortunately for my dignity, they did
not come in to see what was the matter until I had been able to
get into my chair again. When they entered, I felt that the
impression of the slap was red on my face still, but the mark of
the blow was hidden by my hair. Under these fortunate
circumstances, I was able to keep up my character among my
friends, when they inquired about the scuffle, by informing them
that Gentleman Jones had audaciously slapped my face, and that I
had been obliged to retaliate by knocking him down. My word in
the prison was as good as his; and if my version of the story got
fairly the start of his, I had the better chance of the two of
being believed.
<P>
I was rather anxious, the next day, to know what course my polite
and pugilistic instructor would take. To my utter amazement, he
bowed to me as civilly as usual when we met in the yard; he never
denied my version of the story; and when my friends laughed at
him as a thrashed man, he took not the slightest notice of their
agreeable merriment. Antiquity, I think, furnishes us with few
more remarkable characters than Gentleman Jones.
<P>
That evening I thought it desirable to invite a friend to pass
the time with me. As long as my liquor lasted he stopped; when it
was gone, he went away. I was just locking the door after him,
when it was pushed open gently, but very firmly, and Gentleman
Jones walked in.
<P>
My pride, which had not allowed me to apply for protection to the
prison authorities, would not allow me now to call for help. I
tried to get to the fireplace and arm myself with the poker, but
Gentleman Jones was too quick for me. "I have come, sir, to give
you a lesson in morality to-night," he said; and up went his
right hand.
<P>
I stopped the preliminary slap, but before I could hit him, his
terrible left fist reached my head again; and down I fell once
more--upon the hearth-rug this time--not over-heavily.
<P>
"Sir," said Gentleman Jones, making me a bow, "you have now
received your first lesson in morality. Always speak the truth;
and never say what is false of another man behind his back.
To-morrow, with your kind permission, we will finally settle the
adjourned question of the caricature. Good-night."
<P>
I was far too sensible a man to leave the settling of that
question to him. The first thing in the morning I sent a polite
note to Gentleman Jones, informing him that I had abandoned all
idea of exhibiting his likeness to the public in my series of
prints, and giving him full permission to inspect every design I
made before it went out of the prison. I received a most civil
answer, thanking me for my courtesy, and complimenting me on the
extraordinary aptitude with which I profited by the most
incomplete and elementary instruction. I thought I deserved the
compliment, and I think so still. Our conduct, as I have already
intimated, was honorable to us, on either side. It was honorable
attention on the part of Gentleman Jones to correct me when I was
in error; it was honorable common sense in me to profit by the
correction. I have never seen this great man since he compounded
with his creditors and got out of prison; but my feelings toward
him are still those of profound gratitude and respect. He gave me
the only useful teaching I ever had; and if this should meet the
eye of Gentleman Jones I hereby thank him for beginning and
ending my education in two evenings, without costing me or my
family a single farthing.
