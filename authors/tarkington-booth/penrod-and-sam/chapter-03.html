<p><em>PENROD SCHOFIELD, </em>having been "kept-in" for the unjust
period of twenty minutes after school, emerged to a deserted street.
That is, the street was deserted so far as Penrod was concerned.
Here and there people were to be seen upon the sidewalks, but
they were adults, and they and the shade trees had about the same
quality of significance in Penrod's consciousness. Usually he
saw grown people in the mass, which is to say, they were virtually
invisible to him, though exceptions must be taken in favour of
policemen, firemen, street-car conductors, motormen, and all other
men in any sort of uniform or regalia. But this afternoon none
of these met the roving eye, and Penrod set out upon his homeward
way wholly dependent upon his own resources.</p>

<p>To one of Penrod's inner texture, a mere unadorned walk from
one point to another was intolerable, and he had not gone a block
without achieving some slight remedy for the tameness of life.
An electric-light pole at the corner, invested with powers of
observation, might have been surprised to find itself suddenly
enacting a role of dubious honour in improvised melodrama. Penrod,
approaching, gave the pole a look of sharp suspicion, then one
of conviction; slapped it lightly and contemptuously with his
open hand; passed on a few paces, but turned abruptly, and, pointing
his right forefinger, uttered the symbolic word, "Bing!"</p>

<p>The plot was somewhat indefinite; yet nothing is more certain
than that the electric-light pole had first attempted something
against him, then growing bitter when slapped, and stealing after
him to take him treacherously in the back, had got itself shot
through and through by one too old in such warfare to be caught
off his guard.</p>

<p>Leaving the body to lie where it was, he placed the smoking pistol
in a holster at his saddlebow&mdash;he had decided that he was mounted&mdash;and
proceeded up the street. At intervals he indulged himself in other
encounters, reining in at first suspicion of ambush with a muttered,
"Whoa, Charlie!" or "Whoa, Mike!" or even "Whoa, Washington!"
for preoccupation with the enemy outweighed attention to the details
of theatrical consistency, though the steed's varying names were
at least harmoniously masculine, since a boy, in these, creative
moments, never rides a mare. And having brought Charlie or Mike
or Washington to a standstill, Penrod would draw the sure weapon
from its holster and&mdash;"Bing! Bing! Bing!"&mdash;let them have it.</p>

<p>It is not to be understood that this was a noisy performance,
or even an obvious one. It attracted no attention from any pedestrian,
and it was to be perceived only that a boy was proceeding up the
street at a somewhat irregular gait. Three or four years earlier,
when Penrod was seven or eight, he would have shouted "Bing!"
at the top of his voice; he would have galloped openly; all the
world might have seen that he bestrode a charger. But a change
had come upon him with advancing years. Although the grown people
in sight were indeed to him as walking trees, his dramas were
accomplished principally by suggestion and symbol. His "Whoas"
and "Bings" were delivered in a husky whisper, and his equestrianism
was established by action mostly of the mind, the accompanying
artistry of the feet being unintelligible to the passerby.</p>

<p>And yet, though he concealed from observation the stirring little
scenes he thus enacted, a love of realism was increasing within
him. Early childhood is not fastidious about the accessories of
its drama&mdash;a cane is vividly a gun which may instantly, as vividly,
become a horse; but at Penrod's time of life the lath sword is
no longer satisfactory. Indeed, he now had a vague sense that
weapons of wood were unworthy to the point of being contemptible
and ridiculous, and he employed them only when he was alone and
unseen. For months a yearning had grown more and more poignant
in his vitals, and this yearning was symbolized by one of his
most profound secrets. In the inner pocket of his jacket, he carried
a bit of wood whittled into the distant likeness of a pistol,
but not even Sam Williams had seen it. The wooden pistol never
knew the light of day, save when Penrod was in solitude; and yet
it never left his side except at night, when it was placed under
his pillow. Still, it did not satisfy; it was but the token of
his yearning and his dream. With all his might and main Penrod
longed for one thing beyond all others. He wanted a Real Pistol!</p>

<p>That was natural. Pictures of real pistols being used to magnificently
romantic effect were upon almost all the billboards in town, the
year round, and as for the "movie" shows, they could not have
lived an hour unpistoled. In the drug store, where Penrod bought
his candy and soda when he was in funds, he would linger to turn
the pages of periodicals whose illustrations were fascinatingly
pistolic. Some of the magazines upon the very library table at
home were sprinkled with pictures of people (usually in evening
clothes) pointing pistols at other people. Nay, the Library Board
of the town had emitted a "Selected List of Fifteen Books for
Boys," and Penrod had read fourteen of them with pleasure, but
as the fifteenth contained no weapons in the earlier chapters
and held forth little prospect of any shooting at all, he abandoned
it halfway, and read the most sanguinary of the other fourteen
over again. So, the daily food of his imagination being gun, what
wonder that he thirsted for the Real!</p>

<p>He passed from the sidewalk into his own yard, with a subdued
"Bing!"  inflicted upon the stolid person of a gatepost, and,
entering the house through the kitchen, ceased to bing for a time.
However, driven back from the fore part of the house by a dismal
sound of callers, he returned to the kitchen and sat down.</p>

<p>"Della," he said to the cook, "do you know what I'd do if you
was a crook and I had my ottomatic with me?"</p>

<p>Della was industrious and preoccupied. "If I was a cook!" she
repeated ignorantly, and with no cordiality. "Well, I AM a cook.
I'm a-cookin' right now. Either g'wan in the house where y'b'long,
or git out in th' yard!"</p>

<p>Penrod chose the latter, and betook himself slowly to the back
fence, where he was greeted in a boisterous manner by his wistful
little old dog, Duke, returning from some affair of his own in
the alley.</p>

<p>"Get down!" said Penrod coldly, and bestowed a spiritless "Bing!"
upon him.</p>

<p>At this moment a shout was heard from the alley, "Yay, Penrod!"
and the sandy head of comrade Sam Williams appeared above the
fence.</p>

<p>"Come on over," said Penrod.</p>

<p>As Sam obediently climbed the fence, the little old dog, Duke,
moved slowly away, but presently, glancing back over his shoulder
and seeing the two boys standing together, he broke into a trot
and disappeared round a corner of the house. He was a dog of long
and enlightening experience; and he made it clear that the conjunction
of Penrod and Sam portended events which, from his point of view,
might be unfortunate. Duke had a forgiving disposition, but he
also possessed a melancholy wisdom. In the company of either Penrod
or Sam, alone, affection often caused him to linger, albeit with
a little pessimism, but when he saw them together, he invariably
withdrew in as unobtrusive a manner as haste would allow.</p>

<p>"What you doin'?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"Nothin'. What you?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you if you'll come over to our house," said Sam, who
was wearing an important and secretive expression.</p>

<p>"What for?" Penrod showed little interest.</p>

<p>"Well, I said I'd show you if you came on over, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"But you haven't got anything I haven't got," said Penrod indifferently.
"I know everything that's in your yard and in your stable, and
there isn't a thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't say it was in the yard or in the stable, did I?"</p>

<p>"Well, there ain't anything in your house," returned Penrod frankly,
"that I'd walk two feet to look at&mdash;not a thing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" Sam assumed mockery. "Oh, no, you wouldn't! You know
what it is, don't you? Yes, you do!" Penrod's curiosity stirred
somewhat. "Well, all right," he said, "I got nothin' to do. I
just as soon go. What is it?"</p>

<p>"You wait and see," said Sam, as they climbed the fence. "I bet
<em>YOUR </em>ole eyes'll open pretty far in about a minute or
so!"</p>

<p>"I bet they don't. It takes a good deal to get me excited, unless
it's sumpthing mighty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll see!" Sam promised.</p>

<p>He opened an alley, gate and stepped into his own yard in a manner
signalling caution&mdash;though the exploit, thus far, certainly required
none and Penrod began to be impressed and hopeful. They entered
the house, silently, encountering no one, and Sam led the way
upstairs, tiptoeing, implying unusual and increasing peril. Turning,
in the upper hall, they went into Sam's father's bedroom, and
Sam closed the door with a caution so genuine that already Penrod's
eyes began to fulfil his host's prediction. Adventures in another
boy's house are trying to the nerves; and another boy's father's
bedroom, when invaded, has a violated sanctity that is almost
appalling. Penrod felt that something was about to happen&mdash;something
much more important than he had anticipated.</p>

<p>Sam tiptoed across the room to a chest of drawers, and, kneeling,
carefully pulled out the lowest drawer until the surface of its
contents &mdash;Mr. Williams' winter underwear&mdash;lay exposed. Then
he fumbled beneath the garments and drew forth a large object,
displaying it triumphantly to the satisfactorily dumfounded Penrod.</p>

<p>It was a blue-steel Colt's revolver, of the heaviest pattern
made in the Seventies. Mr. Williams had inherited it from Sam's
grandfather (a small man, a deacon, and dyspeptic) and it was
larger and more horrible than any revolver either of the boys
had ever seen in any picture, moving or stationary. Moreover,
greenish bullets of great size were to be seen in the chambers
of the cylinder, suggesting massacre rather than mere murder.
This revolver was Real and it was Loaded!</p>
