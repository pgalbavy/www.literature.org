<p>The conversation dropped there: she gazed thoughtfully out upon
the Teutonic magnificence of One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street
by gaslight; he, arms folded, relapsed into bitter contemplation
of the breakfast-food. So immersed he became in the picture of
an unctuous little boy stuffing himself to repletion under the
admiring smirk of a benevolent parent that he forgot his manacles,
and attempting to stretch his cramped leg, returned to his senses
in a hurry.</p>

<p>"I think," she suggested, quietly, "that, if you care to stretch,
I wouldn't mind it, either. Can you do it discreetly?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," he said in a whisper. "Shall I count three?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"One, two, three," he counted, and they cautiously stretched
their legs.</p>

<p>"I now know how the Siamese twins felt," he said, sullenly. "No
wonder they died young."</p>

<p>She laughed&mdash;a curious, little laugh which was one of the most
agreeable sounds he had ever heard.</p>

<p>"I take it for granted," he said, "that you will always cherish
for me a wholesome and natural hatred."</p>

<p>"I shall never see you again," she replied, simply.</p>

<p>That silenced him for a while; he fished about in his intellect
to find mitigating circumstances. There was none that he knew
of.</p>

<p>"Suppose&mdash;under pleasanter auspices, we should some day meet?"
he suggested.</p>

<p>"We never shall."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"It is scarcely worth while speculating upon such an improbability,"
she said, coldly.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;suppose&#11834;"</p>

<p>She turned toward him. "You desire to know what my attitude would
be toward you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"It would be one of absolutely amiable indifference&mdash;if you really
wish to know," she said so sweetly that he was quite sure his
entire body shrank at least an inch.</p>

<p>"By the way," she added, "the last passenger has left this car."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed, sitting bolt upright. "Now's our time.
Would you mind&#11834;"</p>

<p>"With the very greatest pleasure," she said, quickly; "please
count one, two, three."</p>

<p>He counted; there came a discreet movement, and from under the
hem of her gown there appeared a dainty shoe, accompanied by a
larger masculine companion. He bent down, his fingers seemed to
be all thumbs, and he grew redder and redder.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can do it," she said, stripping off her gloves and
bending over. A stray tendril of bright hair brushed his cheek
as their heads almost came together.</p>

<p>"Goodness, what a dreadful knot!" she breathed, her smooth fingers
busy. The perfume of her hair, her gloves, her gown thrilled him;
he looked at her face, now flushed with effort; his eyes fell
on her delicate hands, her distractingly pretty foot, in its small,
polished shoe.</p>

<p>"Patience," she said, calmly; "this knot must give way&#11834;"</p>

<p>"If it doesn't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Madness lies that way," she breathed. "Wait! Don't dare to move
your foot!"</p>

<p>"We are approaching a station; shall I cut it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;wait! I think I have solved it. There!" she cried with a
breathless laugh. "We are free!"</p>

<p>There was not an instant to lose, for the train had already stopped;
they arose with one accord and hurried out into the silvery Harlem
moonlight&mdash;which does not, perhaps, differ from normal moonlight,
although it seemed to him to do astonishing tricks with her hair
and figure there on the deserted platform, turning her into the
loveliest and most unreal creature he had ever seen in all his
life.</p>

<p>"There ought to be a train pretty soon," he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>"Do you mind my speaking to you now that we are&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Untethered?" she said with a sudden little flurry of laughter.
"Oh, no; why should I care what happens to me now, after taking
a railroad journey tied to the shoe-strings of an absent-minded
stranger?"</p>

<p>"Please don't speak so&mdash;so heartlessly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Heartlessly? What have hearts to do with this evening's lunacy?"
she asked, coolly.</p>

<p>He had an idea, an instinctive premonition, but it was no explanation
to offer her.</p>

<p>Far away up the track the starlike headlight of a train glittered:
he called her attention to it, and she nodded. Neither spoke for
a long while; the headlight grew larger and yellower; the vicious
little train came whizzing in, slowed, halted with a jolt. He
put her aboard and followed into a car absolutely empty save for
themselves. When they had gravely seated themselves side by side
she looked around at him and said without particular severity:
"I can see no reason for our going back together; can you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered with such inoffensive and guileless conviction
that she was silent.</p>

<p>He went on presently: "Monstrous as my stupidity is, monumental
ass as I must appear to you, I am, as a matter of fact, rather
a decent fellow&mdash;the sort of man a girl need not flay alive to
punish."</p>

<p>"I do not desire to punish you. I do not expect to know you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean 'expect,' or 'desire'?"</p>

<p>"I mean both, if you insist." There was a sudden glimmer in her
clear eyes that warned him; but he went on:</p>

<p>"I beg you to give me a chance to prove myself not such a clown
as you think me."</p>

<p>"But I don't think about you at all!" she explained.</p>

<p>"Won't you give me a chance?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Somebody you&mdash;we both know &mdash;I mean to say&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You mean, will I sit here and compare notes with you to find
out whether we both know Tom, Dick, and Harry? No, I will not."</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;so that&mdash;if you don't mind&mdash;somebody can vouch for me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No," she said, decisively.</p>

<p>"I mean &mdash;I would be so grateful&mdash;and I admire you tremendously&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Please do not say that."</p>

<p>"No &mdash;I won't, of course; I don't admire anybody very much,
and I didn't dream of being offensive&mdash;only &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>now
that I've known you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You don't know me," she observed, icily.</p>

<p>"No, of course, I don't know you at all; I'm only talking to
you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"A nice comment upon us both," she observed; "could anything
be more pitifully common?"</p>

<p>"But being tied together, how could we avoid talking about it?"
he pleaded. "When you're tied up like that to a person, it's per&mdash;permitted
to speak, you know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"We talked entirely too much," she said with decision. "Now we
are not tied at all, and I do not see what decent excuse we can
have for conversing about anything.... Do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"What excuse?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing, a sense of humour. A nice spectacle we
should be, you in one otherwise empty car, I in another, bored
to death&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you think," she said, impatiently, "that I require anybody's
society to save myself from <em>ennui</em>?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but I require&#11834;"</p>

<p>"That is impertinent!"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to be; you must know that!" he said.</p>

<p>She looked out of the window.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he began in a cheerful and speculative tone, taking
courage from her silence&mdash;"I wonder whether you know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I will not discuss people I know with you," she said.</p>

<p>"Then let us discuss people I know," he rejoined, amiably.</p>

<p>"Please don't."</p>

<p>"Please let me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Are you never going to forgive me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I shall forget," she said, meaningly.</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Please don't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You are always lingering dangerously close to the border of
impertinence," she said. "I do not wish to be rude or ungracious.
I have been unpardonably annoyed, and&mdash;when I consider my present
false situation &mdash;I am annoyed still more. Let me be unmistakably
clear and concise; I do not feel any&mdash;anger&mdash;toward you; I have
no feeling whatever toward you; and I do not ever expect to see
you again. Let it rest so. I will drop you my best curtsey when
you lift your hat to me at Twenty-ninth Street. Can a guilty man
ask more?"</p>

<p>"Your punishment is severe," he said, flushing.</p>

<p>"My punishment? Who am I punishing, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Me."</p>

<p>"What folly! I entertain no human emotions toward you; I have
no desire to punish you. How could I punish you&mdash;if I wished to?"</p>

<p>"By doing what you are doing."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" she asked rather softly.</p>

<p>"Denying me any hope of ever knowing you."</p>

<p>"You are unfair," she said, biting her lip. "I do not deny you
that 'hope,' as you choose to call it. Consider a moment. Had
you merely seen me on the train you could not have either hoped
or even desired ever to know me. Suppose for a moment&mdash;" she flushed,
but her voice was cool and composed "suppose you were attracted
to me&mdash;thought me agreeable to look at? You surely would never
have dreamed of speaking to me and asking such a thing. Why, then,
should you take unfair advantage of an accident and ask it now?
You have no right to&mdash;nor have I to accord you what you say you
desire."</p>

<p>She spoke very sweetly, meeting his eyes without hesitation.</p>

<p>"May I reply to you?" he asked soberly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you wish."</p>

<p>"You will not take it as an affront?"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;not if&mdash;" She looked at him. "No," she said.</p>

<p>"Then this is my reply: Wherever I might have seen you I should
instantly have desired to know you. That desire would have caused
you no inquietude; I should have remained near you without offense,
perfectly certain in my own mind that somehow and somewhere I
must manage to know you; and to that end&mdash;always without offense,
and without your knowledge &mdash;I should have left the train
when you did, satisfied myself where you lived, and then I should
have scoured the city, and moved heaven and earth to find the
proper person who might properly ask your permission to receive
me. That is what I should have done if I had remained thirty seconds
in the same car with you.... Are you offended?"</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>They journeyed on for some time, saying nothing; she, young face
bent, sensitive lips adroop, perhaps considering what he said;
he, cradling his golf-sticks, trying to keep his eyes off her
and succeeding very badly.</p>

<p>"I wonder what your name is?" she said, looking up at him.</p>

<p>"James Seabury," he replied so quickly that it was almost pathetic.</p>

<p>She mused, frowning a little: "Where have I heard your name?"
she asked with an absent-minded glance at him.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;around, I suppose," he suggested, vaguely.</p>

<p>"But I have heard it. Are you famous?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he said quickly. "I'm an architect, or ought to be.
Fact is, I'm so confoundedly busy golfing and sailing and fishing
and shooting and hunting that I have very little time for business."</p>

<p>"What a confession!" she exclaimed, laughing outright; and the
beauty that transfigured her took his breath away. But her laughter
was brief, her eyes grew more serious than ever: "So you are not
in business?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I am employed," she said calmly, looking at him.</p>

<p>"Are you?" he said, astonished.</p>

<p>"So, you see," she added gaily, "I should have very little time
to see anybody&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You mean me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you, for example."</p>

<p>"You don't work all the while, do you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Usually."</p>

<p>"All the time?"</p>

<p>"I dine&mdash;at intervals."</p>

<p>"That's the very thing!" he said with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>She looked at him gravely.</p>

<p>"Don't you see," he went on, "as soon as you'll let me know you
my sister will call, and then you'll call, and then my sister
will invite&#11834;"</p>

<p>She was suddenly laughing again&mdash;a curious laugh, quite free
and unguarded.</p>

<p>"Of course, you'll tell your sister how we met," she suggested;
"she'll be so anxious to know me when she hears all about it."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," he said coolly, "that I don't know one of my
own sort whenever or however I happen to meet her?"</p>

<p>"Men cannot always tell; I grant you women seldom fail in placing
one another at first glance; but men rarely possess that instinct....
Besides, I tell you I am employed."</p>

<p>"What of it? Even if you wore the exceedingly ornamental uniform
of a parlor-maid it could not worry me."</p>

<p>"Do you think your sister would hasten to call on a saleswoman
at Blumenshine's?" she asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"Nobody wants her to," he retorted, amused.</p>

<p>"Or on a parlor-maid&mdash;for example?"</p>

<p>"Let her see you first; you can't shock her after that.... Are
you?" he inquired gently&mdash;so gently, so pleasantly, that she gave
him a swift look that set his heart galloping.</p>

<p>"Do you really desire to know me?" she asked. But before he could
answer she sprang up, saying: "Good gracious! This is Twenty-eighth
Street! It seems impossible!"</p>

<p>He could not believe it, either, but he fled after her, suit-case
and golf-bag swinging; the gates slammed, they descended the stairs
and emerged on Twenty-eighth Street. "I live on Twenty-ninth Street,"
she said; "shall we say good-bye here?"</p>

<p>"I should think not!" he replied with a scornful decision that
amazed her, but, curiously enough, did not offend her. They walked
up Twenty-eighth Street to Fifth Avenue, crossed, turned north
under the white flare of electricity, then entered Twenty-ninth
Street slowly, side by side, saying nothing.</p>
