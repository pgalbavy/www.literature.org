<p>There is nothing quite like common sense to smooth out troubles.
People who have plenty of just plain common sense are often thought
to be very wise. Their neighbors look up to them and are forever
running to them for advice, and they are very much respected.
That is the way with Grandfather Frog. He is very old and very
wise. Anyway, that is what his neighbors think. The truth is,
he simply has a lot of common sense, which after all is the very
best kind of wisdom.</p>

<p>Now when Little Joe Otter found that Buster Bear had been too
smart for him and that instead of spoiling Buster's fishing in
the Laughing Brook he had really made it easier for Buster to
catch all the fish he wanted, Little Joe went off down to the
Smiling Pool in a great rage.</p>

<p>Billy Mink stopped long enough to eat the fat fish Buster had
left on the bank and then he too went down to the Smiling Pool.</p>

<p>When Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink reached the Smiling Pool,
they climbed up on the Big Rock, and there Little Joe sulked and
sulked, until finally Grandfather Frog asked what the matter was.
Little Joe wouldn't tell, but Billy Mink told the whole story.
When he told how Buster had been too smart for Little Joe, it
tickled him so that Billy had to laugh in spite of himself. So
did Grandfather Frog. So did Jerry Muskrat, who had been listening.
Of course this made Little Joe angrier than ever. He said a lot
of unkind things about Buster Bear and about Billy Mink and Grandfather
Frog and Jerry Muskrat, because they had laughed at the smartness
of Buster.</p>

<p>"He's nothing but a great big bully and thief!" declared Little
Joe.</p>

<p>"Chug-a-rum! He may be a bully, because great big people are
very apt to be bullies, and though I haven't seen him, I guess
Buster Bear is big enough from all I have heard, but I don't see
how he is a thief," said Grandfather Frog.</p>

<p>"Didn't he catch my fish and eat them?" snapped Little Joe. "Doesn't
that make him a thief?"</p>

<p>"They were no more your fish than mine," protested Billy Mink.</p>

<p>"Well, <em>our</em> fish, then! He stole <em>our</em> fish, if
you like that any better. That makes him just as much a thief,
doesn't it?" growled Little Joe.</p>

<p>Grandfather Frog looked up at jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun and
slowly winked one of his great, goggly eyes. "There comes a foolish
green fly," said he. "Who does he belong to?"</p>

<p>"Nobody!" snapped Little Joe. "What have foolish green flies
got to do with my &mdash;I mean <em>our</em> fish?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing at all," replied Grandfather Frog mildly. "I
was just hoping that he would come near enough for me to snap
him up; then he would belong to me. As long as he doesn't, he
doesn't belong to any one. </p>
