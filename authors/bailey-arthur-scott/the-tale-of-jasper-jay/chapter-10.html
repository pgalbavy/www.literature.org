<p>FOR a long time Jasper Jay had been waiting for something. It was fall;
and he impatiently watched the tree-tops on the side of Blue Mountain
change from their quiet summer green to hues of flaming gold and red.
Though they were beautiful, to tell the truth Jasper did not in the
least care what color a tree was. So long as it bore nuts, he was
satisfied. And to him the turning leaves meant only that the autumn was
lengthening--and the nuts were growing ripe.
</p>
<p>That was what Jasper Jay was waiting for. And as soon as the frosts came
and burst open the prickly pods that covered the beechnuts he intended
to lead the first nutting party of the season to the place where the
beeches grew.
</p><p>Now, going a-nutting with a crowd is much more fun than gathering nuts
alone. And Jasper usually preferred a nutting party of a dozen blue
jays. Then he always had twelve times as much fun as he could have just
by himself--because there was twelve times the noise.
</p><p>So on the very first day that the nuts were ready to be eaten Jasper Jay
asked eleven friends to join him. As it happened, Jasper found a company
of twelve waiting for him at the appointed time on the edge of the
woods. Somehow, Noisy Jake (whom Jasper hadn't invited) had heard of the
party. And he invited himself.
</p><p>Jasper was not at all pleased when he found that Noisy Jake intended to
go a-nutting too. He had not yet forgiven that boisterous rowdy for not
having warned him, when Mr. Red-shouldered Hawk was sailing about over
Farmer Green's barnyard, and Jasper had to seek safety in the chicken
house.
</p><p>Jasper gave Jake a cool nod and turned his back on him. But it would
have taken a great deal more than that to hurt Noisy Jake's feelings.
Indeed, he was so impudent that he immediately imitated Mr. Hawk's cry,
"_Kee-you! kee-you!_"
</p><p>It gave Jasper a great start to hear that screech behind his back. He
jumped into the air and alighted with his face toward Noisy Jake, having
turned around while his feet were off the ground.
</p><p>Jake was laughing loudly at his own joke, while all the rest--except
Jasper--squalled with delight.
</p><p>Jasper Jay thought for a moment that he would have to fight Jake on the
spot. But he was in such a hurry to get to the place where the beeches
grew that he decided to pay no more attention to the rude fellow.
</p><p>"Come on!" Jasper cried. "Follow me!" And he made for the beech grove at
top speed, with the nutting party following close behind him.
</p><p>There was a great squawking and screaming and whistling as the nutting
party flew into the tops of the beech trees and the nuts began rattling
down upon the ground.
</p><p>But their fun did not last long. Another nutting party, led by Johnnie
Green, arrived at the grove soon after them; and, of course, that put an
end to their sport. They knew that boys not only whistled but threw
stones as well.
</p><p>It was most disappointing. And Jasper and his friends were feeling quite
peevish when Noisy Jake suddenly cried:
</p><p>"Let's go over to the oak woods! There are plenty of acorns there; and
we can have lots of fun!"
</p><p>All the crowd--except Jasper Jay--shouted something that sounded like
"Hurrah!" And before Jasper knew what was happening everybody had
started for the oak woods. This time it was Noisy Jake that led the
nutting party. And all Jasper could do was to follow with the others.
</p><p>He was no longer the leader. And he was very, very angry. It had been
his party, in the first place. And there was Noisy Jake, whom he had not
even invited to it, acting as if he were the one who should say what
should--or shouldn't--be done.
</p><p>Jasper could see Jake talking with some of the others. And he couldn't
help feeling that they were talking about <u>him</u>. Jake laughed loudly now
and then; and although he was flying fast, he looked around
occasionally, to make sure that the party was following him. Seeing that
Jasper was the last of the procession, Jake shouted to him that he had
better hurry, if he didn't want to be left behind.
</p><p>And that made Jasper Jay more indignant than ever.
