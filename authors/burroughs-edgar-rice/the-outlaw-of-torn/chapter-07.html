<P>
It was a beautiful spring day in May, 1262, that Norman of Torn rode alone
down the narrow trail that led to the pretty cottage with which he had
replaced the hut of his old friend, Father Claude.
<P>
As was his custom, he rode with lowered visor, and nowhere upon his person
or upon the trappings of his horse were sign or insignia of rank or house.
More powerful and richer than many nobles of the court, he was without rank
or other title than that of outlaw and he seemed to assume what in reality
he held in little esteem.
<P>
He wore armor because his old guardian had urged him to do so, and not
because he craved the protection it afforded.  And, for the same cause, he
rode always with lowered visor, though he could never prevail upon the old
man to explain the reason which necessitated this precaution.
<P>
"It is enough that I tell you, my son," the old fellow was wont to say,
"that for your own good as well as mine, you must not show your face to
your enemies until I so direct.  The time will come and soon now, I hope,
when you shall uncover your countenance to all England."
<P>
The young man gave the matter but little thought, usually passing it off as
the foolish whim of an old dotard; but he humored it nevertheless.
<P>
Behind him, as he rode down the steep declivity that day, loomed a very
different Torn from that which he had approached sixteen years before,
when, as a little boy he had ridden through the darkening shadows of the
night, perched upon a great horse behind the little old woman, whose
metamorphosis to the little grim, gray, old man of Torn their advent to the
castle had marked.
<P>
Today the great, frowning pile loomed larger and more imposing than ever in
the most resplendent days of its past grandeur.  The original keep was
there with its huge, buttressed Saxon towers whose mighty fifteen foot
walls were pierced with stairways and vaulted chambers, lighted by
embrasures which, mere slits in the outer periphery of the walls, spread to
larger dimensions within, some even attaining the area of small triangular
chambers.
<P>
The moat, widened and deepened, completely encircled three sides of the
castle, running between the inner and outer walls, which were set at
intervals with small projecting towers so pierced that a flanking fire from
long bows, cross bows and javelins might be directed against a scaling
party.
<P>
The fourth side of the walled enclosure overhung a high precipice, which
natural protection rendered towers unnecessary upon this side.
<P>
The main gateway of the castle looked toward the west and from it ran the
tortuous and rocky trail, down through the mountains toward the valley
below.  The aspect from the great gate was one of quiet and rugged beauty.
A short stretch of barren downs in the foreground only sparsely studded
with an occasional gnarled oak gave an unobstructed view of broad and
lovely meadowland through which wound a sparkling tributary of the Trent.
<P>
Two more gateways let into the great fortress, one piercing the north wall
and one the east.  All three gates were strongly fortified with towered and
buttressed barbicans which must be taken before the main gates could be
reached.  Each barbican was portcullised, while the inner gates were
similarly safeguarded in addition to the drawbridges which, spanning the
moat when lowered, could be drawn up at the approach of an enemy,
effectually stopping his advance.
<P>
The new towers and buildings added to the ancient keep under the direction
of Norman of Torn and the grim, old man whom he called father, were of the
Norman type of architecture, the windows were larger, the carving more
elaborate, the rooms lighter and more spacious.
<P>
Within the great enclosure thrived a fair sized town, for, with his ten
hundred fighting-men, the Outlaw of Torn required many squires, lackeys,
cooks, scullions, armorers, smithies, farriers, hostlers and the like to
care for the wants of his little army.
<P>
Fifteen hundred war horses, beside five hundred sumpter beasts, were
quartered in the great stables, while the east court was alive with cows,
oxen, goats, sheep, pigs, rabbits and chickens.
<P>
Great wooden carts drawn by slow, plodding oxen were daily visitors to the
grim pile, fetching provender for man and beast from the neighboring farm
lands of the poor Saxon peasants, to whom Norman of Torn paid good gold for
their crops.
<P>
These poor serfs, who were worse than slaves to the proud barons who owned
the land they tilled, were forbidden by royal edict to sell or give a
pennysworth of provisions to the Outlaw of Torn, upon pain of death, but
nevertheless his great carts made their trips regularly and always returned
full laden, and though the husbandmen told sad tales to their overlords of
the awful raids of the Devil of Torn in which he seized upon their stuff by
force, their tongues were in their cheeks as they spoke and the Devil's
gold in their pockets.
<P>
And so, while the barons learned to hate him the more, the peasants' love
for him increased.  Them he never injured; their fences, their stock, their
crops, their wives and daughters were safe from molestation even though the
neighboring castle of their lord might be sacked from the wine cellar to
the ramparts of the loftiest tower.  Nor did anyone dare ride rough shod
over the territory which Norman of Torn patrolled.  A dozen bands of
cut-throats he had driven from the Derby hills, and though the barons would
much rather have had all the rest than he, the peasants worshipped him as a
deliverer from the lowborn murderers who had been wont to despoil the weak
and lowly and on whose account the women of the huts and cottages had never
been safe.
<P>
Few of them had seen his face and fewer still had spoken with him, but they
loved his name and his prowess and in secret they prayed for him to their
ancient god, Wodin, and the lesser gods of the forest and the meadow and
the chase, for though they were confessed Christians, still in the hearts
of many beat a faint echo of the old superstitions of their ancestors; and
while they prayed also to the Lord Jesus and to Mary, yet they felt it
could do no harm to be on the safe side with the others, in case they did
happen to exist.
<P>
A poor, degraded, downtrodden, ignorant, superstitious people, they were;
accustomed for generations to the heel of first one invader and then
another and in the interims, when there were any, the heels of their feudal
lords and their rapacious monarchs.
<P>
No wonder then that such as these worshipped the Outlaw of Torn, for since
their fierce Saxon ancestors had come, themselves as conquerors, to
England, no other hand had ever been raised to shield them from oppression.
<P>
On this policy of his toward the serfs and freedmen, Norman of Torn and the
grim, old man whom he called father had never agreed.  The latter was for
carrying his war of hate against all Englishmen, but the young man would
neither listen to it, nor allow any who rode out from Torn to molest the
lowly.  A ragged tunic was a surer defence against this wild horde than a
stout lance or an emblazoned shield.
<P>
So, as Norman of Torn rode down from his mighty castle to visit Father
Claude, the sunlight playing on his clanking armor and glancing from the
copper boss of his shield, the sight of a little group of woodmen kneeling
uncovered by the roadside as he passed was not so remarkable after all.
<P>
Entering the priest's study, Norman of Torn removed his armor and lay back
moodily upon a bench with his back against a wall and his strong, lithe
legs stretched out before him.
<P>
"What ails you, my son ?" asked the priest, "that you look so disconsolate
on this beautiful day ?"
<P>
"I do not know, Father," replied Norman of Torn, "unless it be that I am
asking myself the question, 'What it is all for ?' Why did my father train
me ever to prey upon my fellows ?  I like to fight, but there is plenty of
fighting which is legitimate, and what good may all my stolen wealth avail
me if I may not enter the haunts of men to spend it ?  Should I stick my
head into London town, it would doubtless stay there, held by a hempen
necklace.
<P>
"What quarrel have I with the King or the gentry ?  They have quarrel
enough with me it is true, but, nathless, I do not know why I should have
hated them so before I was old enough to know how rotten they really are.
So it seems to me that I am but the instrument of an old man's spite, not
even knowing the grievance to the avenging of which my life has been
dedicated by another.
<P>
"And at times, Father Claude, as I grow older, I doubt much that the
nameless old man of Torn is my father, so little do I favor him, and never
in all my life have I heard a word of fatherly endearment or felt a caress,
even as a little child.  What think you, Father Claude ?"
<P>
"I have thought much of it, my son," answered the priest.  "It has ever
been a sore puzzle to me, and I have my suspicions, which I have held for
years, but which even the thought of so frightens me that I shudder to
speculate upon the consequences of voicing them aloud.  Norman of Torn, if
you are not the son of the old man you call father, may God forfend that
England ever guesses your true parentage.  More than this, I dare not say
except that, as you value your peace of mind and your life, keep your visor
down and keep out of the clutches of your enemies."
<P>
"Then you know why I should keep my visor down ?"
<P>
"I can only guess, Norman of Torn, because I have seen another whom you
resemble."
<P>
The conversation was interrupted by a commotion from without; the sound of
horses' hoofs, the cries of men and the clash of arms.  In an instant, both
men were at the tiny unglazed window.  Before them, on the highroad, five
knights in armor were now engaged in furious battle with a party of ten or
a dozen other steel-clad warriors, while crouching breathless on her
palfry , a young woman sat a little apart from the contestants.
<P>
Presently, one of the knights detached himself from the melee and rode to
her side with some word of command, at the same time grasping roughly at
her bridle rein.  The girl raised her riding whip and struck repeatedly but
futilely against the iron headgear of her assailant while he swung his
horse up the road, and, dragging her palfrey after him, galloped rapidly
out of sight.
<P>
Norman of Torn sprang to the door, and, reckless of his unarmored
condition, leaped to Sir Mortimer's back and spurred swiftly in the
direction taken by the girl and her abductor.
<P>
The great black was fleet, and, unencumbered by the usual heavy armor of
his rider, soon brought the fugitives to view.  Scarce a mile had been
covered ere the knight, turning to look for pursuers, saw the face of
Norman of Torn not ten paces behind him.
<P>
With a look of mingled surprise, chagrin and incredulity the knight reined
in his horse, exclaiming as he did so, "Mon Dieu, Edward !"
<P>
"Draw and defend yourself," cried Norman of Torn.
<P>
"But, Your Highness," stammered the knight.
<P>
"Draw, or I stick you as I have stuck an hundred other English pigs," cried
Norman of Torn.
<P>
The charging steed was almost upon him and the knight looked to see the
rider draw rein, but, like a black bolt, the mighty Sir Mortimer struck the
other horse full upon the shoulder, and man and steed rolled in the dust of
the roadway.
<P>
The knight arose, unhurt, and Norman of Torn dismounted to give fair battle
upon even terms.  Though handicapped by the weight of his armor, the knight
also had the advantage of its protection, so that the two fought furiously
for several minutes without either gaining an advantage.
<P>
The girl sat motionless and wide-eyed at the side of the road watching
every move of the two contestants.  She made no effort to escape, but
seemed riveted to the spot by the very fierceness of the battle she was
beholding, as well, possibly, as by the fascination of the handsome giant
who had espoused her cause.  As she looked upon her champion, she saw a
lithe, muscular, brown-haired youth whose clear eyes and perfect figure,
unconcealed by either bassinet or hauberk, reflected the clean, athletic
life of the trained fighting man.
<P>
Upon his face hovered a faint, cold smile of haughty pride as the sword
arm, displaying its mighty strength and skill in every move, played with
the sweating, puffing, steel-clad enemy who hacked and hewed so futilely
before him.  For all the din of clashing blades and rattling armor, neither
of the contestants had inflicted much damage, for the knight could neither
force nor insinuate his point beyond the perfect guard of his unarmored
foe, who, for his part, found difficulty in penetrating the other's armor.
<P>
Finally, by dint of his mighty strength, Norman of Torn drove his blade
through the meshes of his adversary's mail, and the fellow, with a cry of
anguish, sank limply to the ground.
<P>
"Quick, Sir Knight !" cried the girl.  "Mount and flee; yonder come his
fellows."
<P>
And surely, as Norman of Torn turned in the direction from which he had
just come, there, racing toward him at full tilt, rode three steel-armored
men on their mighty horses.
<P>
"Ride, madam," cried Norman of Torn, "for fly I shall not, nor may I,
alone, unarmored, and on foot hope more than to momentarily delay these
three fellows, but in that time you should easily make your escape.  Their
heavy-burdened animals could never o'ertake your fleet palfrey."
<P>
As he spoke, he took note for the first time of the young woman.  That she
was a lady of quality was evidenced not alone by the richness of her riding
apparel and the trappings of her palfrey, but as well in her noble and
haughty demeanor and the proud expression of her beautiful face.
<P>
Although at this time nearly twenty years had passed over the head of
Norman of Torn, he was without knowledge or experience in the ways of
women, nor had he ever spoken with a female of quality or position.  No
woman graced the castle of Torn nor had the boy, within his memory, ever
known a mother.
<P>
His attitude therefore was much the same toward women as it was toward men,
except that he had sworn always to protect them.  Possibly, in a way, he
looked up to womankind, if it could be said that Norman of Torn looked up
to anything: God, man or devil -- it being more his way to look down upon
all creatures whom he took the trouble to notice at all.
<P>
As his glance rested upon this woman, whom fate had destined to alter the
entire course of his life, Norman of Torn saw that she was beautiful, and
that she was of that class against whom he had preyed for years with his
band of outlaw cut-throats.  Then he turned once more to face her enemies
with the strange inconsistency which had ever marked his methods.
<P>
Tomorrow he might be assaulting the ramparts of her father's castle, but
today he was joyously offering to sacrifice his life for her -- had she
been the daughter of a charcoal burner he would have done no less.  It was
enough that she was a woman and in need of protection.
<P>
The three knights were now fairly upon him, and with fine disregard for
fair play, charged with couched spears the unarmored man on foot.  But as
the leading knight came close enough to behold his face, he cried out in
surprise and consternation:
<P>
"Mon Dieu, le Prince !" He wheeled his charging horse to one side.  His
fellows, hearing his cry, followed his example, and the three of them
dashed on down the high road in as evident anxiety to escape as they had
been keen to attack.
<P>
"One would think they had met the devil," muttered Norman of Torn, looking
after them in unfeigned astonishment.
<P>
"What means it, lady ?" he asked turning to the damsel, who had made no
move to escape.
<P>
"It means that your face is well known in your father's realm, my Lord
Prince," she replied.  "And the King's men have no desire to antagonize
you, even though they may understand as little as I why you should espouse
the cause of a daughter of Simon de Montfort."
<P>
"Am I then taken for Prince Edward of England ?" he asked.
<P>
"An' who else should you be taken for, my Lord ?"
<P>
"I am not the Prince," said Norman of Torn.  "It is said that Edward is in
France."
<P>
"Right you are, sir," exclaimed the girl.  "I had not thought on that; but
you be enough of his likeness that you might well deceive the Queen
herself.  And you be of a bravery fit for a king's son.  Who are you then,
Sir Knight, who has bared your steel and faced death for Bertrade, daughter
of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester ?"
<P>
"Be you De Montfort's daughter, niece of King Henry ?" queried Norman of
Torn, his eyes narrowing to mere slits and face hardening.
<P>
"That I be," replied the girl, "an' from your face I take it you have
little love for a De Montfort," she added, smiling.
<P>
"An' whither may you be bound, Lady Bertrade de Montfort ?  Be you niece or
daughter of the devil, yet still you be a woman, and I do not war against
women.  Wheresoever you would go will I accompany you to safety."
<P>
"I was but now bound, under escort of five of my father's knights, to visit
Mary, daughter of John de Stutevill of Derby."
<P>
"I know the castle well," answered Norman of Torn, and the shadow of a grim
smile played about his lips, for scarce sixty days had elapsed since he had
reduced the stronghold, and levied tribute on the great baron.  "Come, you
have not far to travel now, and if we make haste you shall sup with your
friend before dark."
<P>
So saying, he mounted his horse and was turning to retrace their steps down
the road when he noticed the body of the dead knight lying where it had
fallen.
<P>
"Ride on," he called to Bertrade de Montfort, "I will join you in an
instant."
<P>
Again dismounting, he returned to the side of his late adversary, and
lifting the dead knight's visor, drew upon the forehead with the point of
his dagger the letters NT.
<P>
The girl turned to see what detained him, but his back was toward her and
he knelt beside his fallen foeman, and she did not see his act.  Brave
daughter of a brave sire though she was, had she seen what he did, her
heart would have quailed within her and she would have fled in terror from
the clutches of this scourge of England, whose mark she had seen on the
dead foreheads of a dozen of her father's knights and kinsmen.
<P>
Their way to Stutevill lay past the cottage of Father Claude, and here
Norman of Torn stopped to don his armor.  Now he rode once more with
lowered visor, and in silence, a little to the rear of Bertrade de Montfort
that he might watch her face, which, of a sudden, had excited his interest.
<P>
Never before, within the scope of his memory, had he been so close to a
young and beautiful woman for so long a period of time, although he had
often seen women in the castles that had fallen before his vicious and
terrible attacks.  While stories were abroad of his vile treatment of women
captives, there was no truth in them.  They were merely spread by his
enemies to incite the people against him.  Never had Norman of Torn laid
violent hand upon a woman, and his cut-throat band were under oath to
respect and protect the sex, on penalty of death.
<P>
As he watched the semi-profile of the lovely face before him, something
stirred in his heart which had been struggling for expression for years.
It was not love, nor was it allied to love, but a deep longing for
companionship of such as she, and such as she represented.  Norman of Torn
could not have translated this feeling into words for he did not know, but
it was the far faint cry of blood for blood and with it, mayhap, was mixed
not alone the longing of the lion among jackals for other lions, but for
his lioness.
<P>
They rode for many miles in silence when suddenly she turned, saying:
<P>
"You take your time, Sir Knight, in answering my query.  Who be ye ?"
<P>
"I am Nor -- " and then he stopped.  Always before he had answered that
question with haughty pride.  Why should he hesitate, he thought.  Was it
because he feared the loathing that name would inspire in the breast of
this daughter of the aristocracy he despised ?  Did Norman of Torn fear to
face the look of seem and repugnance that was sure to be mirrored in that
lovely face ?
<P>
"I am from Normandy," he went on quietly.  "A gentleman of France."
<P>
"But your name ?" she said peremptorily.  "Are you ashamed of your name ?"
<P>
"You may call me Roger," he answered.  "Roger de Conde."
<P>
"Raise your visor, Roger de Conde," she commanded.  "I do not take pleasure
in riding with a suit of armor; I would see that there is a man within."
<P>
Norman of Torn smiled as he did her bidding, and when he smiled thus, as he
rarely did, he was good to look upon.
<P>
"It is the first command I have obeyed since I turned sixteen, Bertrade de
Montfort," he said.
<P>
The girl was about nineteen, full of the vigor and gaiety of youth and
health; and so the two rode on their journey talking and laughing as they
might have been friends of long standing.
<P>
She told him of the reason for the attack upon her earlier in the day,
attributing it to an attempt on the part of a certain baron, Peter of
Colfax, to abduct her, his suit for her hand having been peremptorily and
roughly denied by her father.
<P>
Simon de Montfort was no man to mince words, and it is doubtless that the
old reprobate who sued for his daughter's hand heard some unsavory truths
from the man who had twice scandalized England's nobility by his rude and
discourteous, though true and candid, speeches to the King.
<P>
"This Peter of Colfax shall be looked to," growled Norman of Torn.  "And,
as you have refused his heart and hand, his head shall be yours for the
asking.  You have but to command, Bertrade de Montfort."
<P>
"Very well," she laughed, thinking it but the idle boasting so much
indulged in in those days.  "You may bring me his head upon a golden dish,
Roger de Conde."
<P>
"And what reward does the knight earn who brings to the feet of his
princess the head of her enemy ?" he asked lightly.
<P>
"What boon would the knight ask ?"
<P>
"That whatsoever a bad report you hear of your knight, of whatsoever
calumnies may be heaped upon him, you shall yet ever be his friend, and
believe in his honor and his loyalty."
<P>
The girl laughed gaily as she answered, though something seemed to tell her
that this was more than play.
<P>
"It shall be as you say, Sir Knight," she replied.  "And the boon once
granted shall be always kept."
<P>
Quick to reach decisions and as quick to act, Norman of Torn decided that
he liked this girl and that he wished her friendship more than any other
thing he knew of.  And wishing it, he determined to win it by any means
that accorded with his standard of honor; an honor which in many respects
was higher than that of the nobles of his time.
<P>
They reached the castle of De Stutevill late in the afternoon, and there,
Norman of Torn was graciously welcomed and urged to accept the Baron's
hospitality overnight.
<P>
The grim humor of the situation was too much for the outlaw, and, when
added to his new desire to be in the company of Bertrade de Montfort, he
made no effort to resist, but hastened to accept the warm welcome.
<P>
At the long table upon which the evening meal was spread sat the entire
household of the Baron, and here and there among the men were evidences of
painful wounds but barely healed, while the host himself still wore his
sword arm in a sling.
<P>
"We have been through grievous times," said Sir John, noticing that his
guest was glancing at the various evidences of conflict.  "That fiend,
Norman the Devil, with his filthy pack of cut-throats, besieged us for ten
days, and then took the castle by storm and sacked it.  Life is no longer
safe in England with the King spending his time and money with foreign
favorites and buying alien soldiery to fight against his own barons,
instead of insuring the peace and protection which is the right of every
Englishman at home.
<P>
"But," he continued, "this outlaw devil will come to the end of a short
halter when once our civil strife is settled, for the barons themselves
have decided upon an expedition against him, if the King will not subdue
him."
<P>
"An' he may send the barons naked home as he did the King's soldiers,"
laughed Bertrade de Montfort.  "I should like to see this fellow; what may
he look like -- from the appearance of yourself, Sir John, and many of your
men-at-arms, there should be no few here but have met him."
<P>
    "Not once did he raise his visor while he was among us," replied the
Baron, "but there are those who claim they had a brief glimpse of him and
that he is of horrid countenance, wearing a great yellow beard and having
one eye gone, and a mighty red scar from his forehead to his chin."
<P>
"A fearful apparition," murmured Norman of Torn.  "No wonder he keeps his
helm closed."
<P>
"But such a swordsman," spoke up a son of De Stutevill.  "Never in all the
world was there such swordplay as I saw that day in the courtyard."
<P>
"I, too, have seen some wonderful swordplay," said Bertrade de Montfort,
"and that today.  O he !" she cried, laughing gleefully, "verily do I
believe I have captured the wild Norman of Torn, for this very knight, who
styles himself Roger de Conde, fights as I ne'er saw man fight before, and
he rode with his visor down until I chide him for it."
<P>
Norman of Torn led in the laugh which followed, and of all the company he
most enjoyed the joke.
<P>
"An' speaking of the Devil," said the Baron, "how think you he will side
should the King eventually force war upon the barons ?  With his thousand
hell-hounds, the fate of England might well he in the palm of his bloody
hand."
<P>
"He loves neither King nor baron," spoke Mary de Stutevill, "and I rather
lean to the thought that he will serve neither, but rather plunder the
castles of both rebel and royalist whilst their masters be absent at war."
<P>
"It be more to his liking to come while the master be home to welcome him,"
said De Stutevill, ruthfully.  "But yet I am always in fear for the safety
of my wife and daughters when I be away from Derby for any time.  May the
good God soon deliver England from this Devil of Torn."
<P>
"I think you may have no need of fear on that score," spoke Mary, "for
Norman of Torn offered no violence to any woman within the wall of
Stutevill, and when one of his men laid a heavy hand upon me, it was the
great outlaw himself who struck the fellow such a blow with his mailed hand
as to crack the ruffian's helm, saying at the time, 'Know you, fellow,
Norman of Torn does not war upon women ?'"
<P>
Presently the conversation turned to other subjects and Norman of Torn
heard no more of himself during that evening.
<P>
His stay at the castle of Stutevill was drawn out to three days, and then,
on the third day, as he sat with Bertrade de Montfort in an embrasure of
the south tower of the old castle, he spoke once more of the necessity for
leaving and once more she urged him to remain.
<P>
"To be with you, Bertrade of Montfort," he said boldly, "I would forego any
other pleasure, and endure any privation, or face any danger, but there are
others who look to me for guidance and my duty calls me away from you.  You
shall see me again, and at the castle of your father, Simon de Montfort, in
Leicester.  Provided," he added, "that you will welcome me there."
<P>
"I shall always welcome you, wherever I may be, Roger de Conde," replied
the girl.
<P>
"Remember that promise," he said smiling.  "Some day you may be glad to
repudiate it."
<P>
"Never," she insisted, and a light that shone in her eyes as she said it
would have meant much to a man better versed in the ways of women than was
Norman of Torn.
<P>
"I hope not," he said gravely.  "I cannot tell you, being but poorly
trained in courtly ways, what I should like to tell you, that you might
know how much your friendship means to me.  Goodbye, Bertrade de Montfort,"
and he bent to one knee, as he raised her fingers to his lips.
<P>
As he passed over the drawbridge and down toward the highroad a few minutes
later on his way back to Torn, he turned for one last look at the castle
and there, in an embrasure in the south tower, stood a young woman who
raised her hand to wave, and then, as though by sudden impulse, threw a
kiss after the departing knight, only to disappear from the embrasure with
the act.
<P>
As Norman of Torn rode back to his grim castle in the hills of Derby, he
had much food for thought upon the way.  Never till now had he realized
what might lie in another manner of life, and he felt a twinge of
bitterness toward the hard, old man whom he called father, and whose
teachings from the boy's earliest childhood had guided him in the ways that
had out him off completely from the society of other men, except the wild
horde of outlaws, ruffians and adventurers that rode beneath the grisly
banner of the young chief of Torn.
<P>
Only in an ill-defined, nebulous way did he feel that it was the girl who
had come into his life that caused him for the first time to feel shame for
his past deeds.  He did not know the meaning of love, and so he could not
know that he loved Bertrade de Montfort.
<P>
And another thought which now filled his mind was the fact of his strange
likeness to the Crown Prince of England.  This, together with the words of
Father Claude, puzzled him sorely.  What might it mean ?  Was it a heinous
offence to own an accidental likeness to a king's son ?
<P>
But now that he felt he had solved the reason that he rode always with
closed helm, he was for the first time anxious himself to hide his face
from the sight of men.  Not from fear, for he knew not fear, but from some
