<p>The Panther was in the ugliest mood conceivable. Missionary Finley
was well aware of this before approaching and addressing him.
Consequently, when the chieftain called him a dog and declared
he should die, the good man was neither silenced nor overthrown,
though it would be untrue to say he was not alarmed for his own
safety, but he had counted the cost before making the venture.</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon did not always look upon the missionary as a dog,"
he said, with gentle dignity; "he once called him brother."</p>

<p>"It was because he spoke with a single tongue and was the friend
of the red man," The Panther made haste to say, with no abatement
in the ferocity of expression or manner.</p>

<p>"The missionary always speaks with a single tongue, and he will
be the friend of the red man as long as he lives."</p>

<p>If possible, the wrath of voice and action became more venomous
on the part of The Panther. He unfolded his arms, so as to give
facility of gesture, and with one step forward placed himself
so near the white man that the two could have embraced each other
with little change of position. Then he bent his hideous countenance
until the gleaming eyes, the dangling hair, the white teeth and
the painted features were almost against the mild, beneficent
face, which did not shrink or show the slightest change of looks.</p>

<p>One of the warriors then threw additional wood on the fire, and
the blaze of light lit up the scene as if at noon-day. The Shawanoes
instinctively drew back, so as to leave the principal figures
not only in prominent view, but apart from the others. No one
presumed to take any part in the disputation, but in the stillness
and general hush the words of both were audible to every warrior
present.</p>

<p>Little Mabel Ashbridge was perplexed and uncertain what she ought
to say or do, if indeed, she could say or do anything. She did
not recognize the white man who suddenly appeared and addressed
the dreadful Indian in a tongue she could not understand, for
it will be remembered that, although the missionary had joined
the company of fugitives some time before, she saw his countenance
for the first time when it reflected the glow of the firelight.</p>

<p>Had Finley given her one encouraging word, or even look, she
would have rushed to his arms and begged him to take her to her
parents and brother. This would have been a dangerous diversion,
and, dreading it, the missionary carefully acted as though he
had no knowledge of her presence, but she was in his field of
vision, and while talking with the savage chieftain he knew the
child, mute and wondering, was seated on the log and intently
watching both.</p>

<p>As The Panther stepped forward in the manner described, and thrust
his baleful countenance into that of the white man, he said, with
atrocious fierceness:</p>

<p>"The missionary lies; he has the forked tongue of the serpent,
and like all the pale-faces, he is the enemy of the red man."</p>

<p>"But Wa-on-mon once said he was the friend of the missionary;
why does he say now that he is an enemy?"</p>

<p>"Did he not fight against the Shawanoes this night? Did he not
help the pale face dogs to flee across the river in the boat?"</p>

<p>These questions were expected by Finley, and his tact, delicacy
and skill were tested to the utmost in meeting them. Following
the practice of The Panther, he continued referring to himself
in the third person.</p>

<p>"The missionary gives his days and nights to help those that
are in need of help, and he does not ask whether their color is
white or black or red. He was on his way to visit the red men
that Wa-on-mon once said were the brothers of the missionary,
when he came upon some of his own people who were in sore distress.
He did what he could to help them, and then left to speak to Wa-on-mon."</p>

<p>"And why does he wish to speak to Wa-on-mon?"</p>

<p>It was a subtle question. The cunning Indian suspected the errand
of the good man, but its avowal at this juncture would have been
fatal; it must be parried.</p>

<p>"When the missionary last entered the lodge of Wa-on-mon, he
did not ask him why he wished to speak to him, but gave him welcome.
Wa-on-mon now speaks in another way."</p>

<p>"Because the missionary does not seek Wa-on-mon for himself,
but for another; the missionary's heart is not red, but is white."</p>

<p>"It is red and white, for it loves the white man and the red
man. The heart of Wa-on-mon is red, and he therefore loves his
people. Should not the missionary feel thus toward those whom
the Great Spirit is pleased to make white?"</p>

<p>"The Indian is the child of the Great Spirit; the pale-face is
the child of the evil spirit; these are the hunting grounds of
the red man, and the pale-face has no right here."</p>

<p>It was the same old plea which Finley had heard from the first
day he held converse with a member of the American race, and which
he knew would be dinned into his ears to the very end, but he
never listened to it with impatience.</p>

<p>"The hunting grounds are broad and long, the streams are deep
and full of fish, the woods abound with game, there is room for
the red men and pale-faces to live beside each other."</p>

<p>"But they can never live beside each other!" exclaimed The Panther,
with a deadlier flash of the eye; "the pale-faces are dogs; they
steal the hunting grounds from the Indians; they rob and cheat
them; they shoot our warriors and then call us brothers!"</p>

<p>No words can picture the scorn which the chieftain threw into
these expressions. He flung his head back with an upward graceful
swing of the arms, which added immense force to his declaration.
It was an unconscious but a fine dramatic effect.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty in a "pow-wow" of this nature was that the
balance of argument was invariably on the side of the Indian.
The white men had invaded the hunting grounds of the aborigines.
The French and Indian war was a prodigious struggle between the
two rival nations of Europe as to which should own those hunting
grounds; neither thought or cared for the rights of the red man;
they had never done so.</p>

<p>The history of the settlement of this country, as has been said,
is simply a history of violence, wrong, fraud, rapine, injustice,
persecution, and crime on the part of the Caucasian against the
American, relieved now and then, at remote periods, by such wise
and beneficent acts as the Quaker treaty under the old tree at
Shackamaxon, and stained with the hue of hell by such crimes as
the massacre of the Moravian Indians, the capture of the Seminole
chieftain Osceola under a flag of truce, the slaughter in later
days of Colonel Chivington, and innumerable other instances of
barbarity never surpassed by the most ferocious savages of the
dark continent.</p>

<p>"Many of the pale-faces are evil," said the missionary. "The
words of Wa-on-mon are true of a great number, I am sorry to say,
but they are not true of all."</p>

<p>"They are true of all. They are true of the missionary."</p>

<p>The firelight showed a deeper flush that sprang to the face of
the good man, who was not, and never could be, fully freed of
much of the old Adam that lingered in his nature. His impulse
was strong to smite the chieftain to the earth for his deadly
insult, but Finley always held such promptings well in hand, and
the duskier hue on each health-tinted cheek was the only evidence
that his feelings had been stirred. His voice was as low and softly
modulated as a woman's. He folded both arms over the muzzle of
his rifle, whose stock rested on the leaves at his feet, and remained
calmly confronting the savage chieftain, who more than once seemed
ready to snatch out his knife and drive it into the heart of the
man of God.</p>

<p>"The eyes of Wa-on-mon are not in the sunlight; the smoke is
in them; when the sun drives away the smoke he will see the missionary
as he saw him when they hunted the deer and buffalo and bear together,
and when they helped the Wyandot, Kush-la-ka, to his wigwam."</p>

<p>This allusion was to an incident only a few months old. Kush-la-ka
was almost mortally wounded in a death struggle with an immense
bear, and would have perished had not The Panther and Finley looked
after him and helped him to his own home.</p>

<p>The good man hoped the recall of the occurrence would stir a
responsive chord in the heart of the chieftain, and open the way
for uttering the prayer which he had not yet dared to hint; but
the failure was absolute; the mood of The Panther was too sullen,
too revengeful, too deeply stirred by the memory of recent wrongs
for it to be amenable (as it occasionally had been) to gentle
influences. He persisted in regarding the missionary as a presumptuous
and execrated enemy.</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon is on the war-path," he fairly hissed; "he is the
enemy of all the pale faces."</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon is a great chieftain; the heart of the missionary
is grieved. Wa-on-mon speaks as he feels, and the missionary will
dispute him no more."</p>

<p>This abrupt collapse, as it may be termed, of the visitor was
unexpected by the Shawanoe. It was a masterful stroke, and produced
an immediate effect, though so slight in its nature that a man
less observant than Finley would have failed to perceive it.</p>

<p>"Why does the missionary come to the camp of Wa-on-mon when more
than one of the Shawanoes have fallen by the rifles of the pale-faces?"</p>

<p>"And the rifles of the Shawanoes have done grievous harm among
the pale-faces?"</p>

<p>"The heart of Wa-on-mon rejoices to learn that!" exclaimed the
chieftain; "how many of them have fallen?"</p>

<p>"There is mourning among my people; one of them fell dead at
my side, and others are grievously hurt."</p>

<p>"There shall be more mourning, for not one of them shall be spared
to reach the block-house! They shall all be cut off."</p>

<p>"The will of the Great Spirit shall be done."</p>

<p>"And why does the missionary come to the camp of Wa-on-mon? He
has been asked the question before."</p>

<p>"And has answered," Finley was quick to say, hesitating to avow
the whole truth, even though it was evident it was known from
the first to the chieftain.</p>

<p>"Cannot the missionary speak with a single tongue? Does he come
to seek Wa-on-mon alone?"</p>

<p>"No," was the prompt response.</p>

<p>"Who comes he to see?"</p>

<p>"The little captive in the hands of Wa-on-mon."</p>

<p>"She is there," said the chief, pointing to the fallen tree upon
which little Mabel sat; "he can see her; he may speak to her."</p>

<p>"The missionary thanks Wa-on-mon&mdash;may he call him his brother?"</p>

<p>"No," was the sharp response, "the missionary and Wa-on-mon were
once brothers, but they are so no longer."</p>

<p>"The missionary thanks Wa-on-mon, but he is not, as yet, ready
to talk to the suffering little one."</p>

<p>"Little time remains to do so; she dies at sunrise."</p>

<p>"That is several hours distant; in the meanwhile, the missionary
would speak to Wa-on-mon of the child."</p>

<p>"What does he wish to say?"</p>

<p>"He has a prayer to make."</p>

<p>"What is the prayer?" asked the chief, well aware what it was.</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon has two little ones, a warrior and a sweet girl. The
missionary has played and talked with them and held them on his
knee; does Wa-on-mon believe that the missionary would not risk
his life to save them from harm?"</p>

<p>Finley paused, but there was no response. The way had been opened
at last, and it was too late now to turn back. He must press forward
to the final solution, no matter what that should prove to be,
but all the signs were ominous of the worst.</p>

<p>The question was anything but pleasing to the chieftain. He was
silent a minute, and replied by means of a pointed question himself:</p>

<p>"Is the child on the tree the child of the missionary?"</p>

<p>"No, but she is the daughter of a friend; she is not a warrior
who fires a gun at the Shawanoes of Wa-on-mon; she has harmed
none of them."</p>

<p>"But her parents did; to harm her will hurt them more than will
a bullet fired from the gun of the chieftain; therefore, Wa-on-mon
will kill her."</p>

<p>"Let Wa-on-mon listen to the good spirit that whispers in his
ears; let him show the same kindness to the prisoner that the
missionary will show to the pappoose of the great chieftain; that
the father of the captive would show to the children of Wa-on-mon
if the Great Spirit gave them to him."</p>

<p>"The missionary speaks with a double tongue; he lies; he is a
dog, and he must say such words no more!" broke in The Panther,
with a voice, a manner, and a glare that showed his patience was
exhausted. "The missionary deserves the death of a dog, but he
may go back to his people; he cannot take the child with him;
she shall die when the sun rises."</p>

<p>"If the missionary cannot take the child of his friend with him
then he will not go back to him."</p>

<p>"If he stays till the sun shows itself above the woods then he
shall die."</p>

<p>Finley saw it would not do to hesitate longer. The moment had
come for him to fall back on the last and only recourse left,
and much as he regretted the act (for it was at variance with
his principles), he now made it promptly and with a skill, a cunning
and a delicacy that could not be excelled.</p>
