<p>When Hay-uta, the ally of Deerfoot, parted with him so that the
reconnoissance of the Pawnee camp could be made separately, he
went down stream&mdash;that is, in the direction opposite to that taken
by Deerfoot. He moved faster than the Shawanoe, and emerged from
the river at the moment the other entered it.</p>

<p>Before this, he had taken another scrutiny of the two warriors,
whom he had pointed out as members of the party that bought Otto
Relstaub from the Sauks. He thought it unlikely that a mistake
could have been made, and the second inspection proved he was
right beyond all doubt.</p>

<p>Without any reason for such belief, Hay-uta concluded there were
other Pawnees in the vicinity. The appearance of the camp suggested
in some way that several were missing. He therefore conducted
his movements as though danger threatened him from all points.</p>

<p>Hay-uta was daring and skillful. He had been engaged on more
than one similar enterprise, with the difference that the camps
where he reconnoitered previously were those of bitter enemies.
Having met the Pawnees before, on what may be considered neutral
if not friendly ground, he would have felt no great misgivings
while marching into their camp, without any effort at concealment.</p>

<p>But, if discovered prowling through the woods, the case would
be different. It would be hard to offer any explanation, and,
therefore, it was the more necessary to avoid detection while
thus employed.</p>

<p>The Sauk was as much puzzled as Deerfoot to guess what had become
of Otto. Two of the warriors, if not all of them, were able to
tell, but Hay-uta could not expect to draw the information from
them. Perhaps Deerfoot might do so.</p>

<p>There was good ground to fear the poor lad had been put out of
the way forever, but the Sauk was still more convinced that he
was not only alive and well, but was at no great distance from
the camp of the Pawnees.</p>

<p>Instead of going directly toward the latter, as did Deerfoot,
the Sauk started out on what may be described as a large circle,
inclosing the war party near the river. His action was based on
the somewhat curious theory that the Pawnees which he had seen
did not compose the main body that would be found grouped somewhere
within the woods. It may as well be said that he was mistaken
in this supposition, though the reader has learned that a number
of Indians were scattered at different points, and it was their
rapid convergence which kept Deerfoot on the move.</p>

<p>Hay-uta had not gone far on the edge of the semi-circle, when
the shouts and sounds of firearms from that direction of the camp
left no doubt that trouble had broken out there. Desirous of learning
what it meant, he moved toward the point, but before he went near
enough to discover any thing, he detected one of the Pawnees doing
the same thing.</p>

<p>The warrior was just far enough in advance for Hay-uta to catch
a glimpse of his figure as it twinkled among the trees. He was
going on a long, loping trot, which, if not very rapid, was sufficiently
so to carry him beyond sight within a few seconds after the Sauk
observed him.</p>

<p>The unexpected turn which events had taken led Hay-uta to stop
and question himself as to the right course to follow. His intelligence
told him that Deerfoot was fleeing through the woods, with an
indefinite number of enemies in pursuit. The Sauk grimly smiled.</p>

<p>"The Pawnees will overtake the young Shawanoe when they outrun
the eagle as he flies among the clouds. The arrow of his own bow
is scarce faster than he."</p>

<p>The confidence of Hay-uta in the prowess of Deerfoot was warranted,
as we can not help agreeing, but suspecting the truth, as the
Sauk did, we can hardly understand how he believed he would succeed
in extricating himself.</p>

<p>Making sure that no one was in the vicinity the Sauk stood for
perhaps fifteen minutes, while he listened closely to the sounds
which came from different points in the wood. He was able to form
a pretty fair idea of what it all meant, though of necessity much
was left to conjecture.</p>

<p>It was the training of Hay-uta, from his earliest youth, which
led him to keep his glances flitting here and there in all directions,
while using his ears to determine what was going on. Had he not
done so, he would have failed to note a suspicious proceeding
on his right.</p>

<p>Although looking toward a different point just then, he detected
something which led him to believe that one of the strange warriors
was trying to steal close to him. It seemed as if a Pawnee, having
discovered the Sauk, was trying to get close enough to make the
aim of his gun sure.</p>

<p>The first glance toward that point convinced Hay-uta that his
enemy was making for the trunk of a tree, less than a hundred
yards distant. Its diameter was so great that it would have sheltered
two persons at the same time; and it exceeded to such an extent
all the others near it, that it was natural for one to seek its
protection.</p>

<p>The Sauk was sure that the warrior was several rods beyond this
tree, toward which he was stealing, while striving to keep the
trunk between him and Hay-uta. So long, therefore, as the Sank
remained motionless, the Pawnee would be protected, though there
were other trees of less size behind which he could escape should
it become necessary.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the Sauk was stupid enough to stand
like a wooden Indian, and allow his enemy every advantage he sought.
There were plenty of trunks, also, which he could use as a screen
while engaged in a characteristic duel with the other Indian;
but, instead of doing so, he began striding off toward the right,
keeping his gaze fixed on the larger trunk, and holding his rifle
at full cock, so that it could be aimed and fired on an instant's
call. At the same time, he swung his right arm about his head,
and then struck the left hand over his heart. This was the sign
of comity, and the moment it should catch the eye of the Pawnee,
he would be sure to recognize it as such, though whether he would
accept it remained to be seen.</p>

<p>The action of the Sank was so prompt, and apparently so unexpected,
that the crouching savage was caught unawares. He was uncovered
with great cleverness, and indeed Hay-uta could have "winged"
him had he chosen to do so. It was not from lack of inclination
that he held his fire, but because prudence demanded it. As it
was, he was confident of his ability to anticipate any hostile
movement on the part of the other.</p>

<p>Flanked in this fashion, the Pawnee was equally prompt in reciprocating
the gestures of good-will which greeted him. While in the act
of straightening up, he imitated the salutations which, though
somewhat different from those to which he was accustomed, were
too plain in their meaning to be mistaken.</p>

<p>When two strangers open negotiations by declaring themselves
friends, it is natural they should advance and shake hands (provided
that manner of salutation is in vogue), and such was the next
proceeding of the red men.</p>

<p>"The heart of Hay-uta bounds with joy when he looks upon the
face of his brave brother of the unknown totem," said the Sauk.</p>

<p>"The Flying Deer, of the Pawnees, would weep till the Great Spirit
in sorrow for him called him home, had he been made to wait for
this brave warrior, who has journeyed so many suns that he may
look upon his face," was the substantial response of the Pawnee.</p>

<p>All this was very fine, but one drawback remained&mdash;neither Indian
understood a single syllable uttered by the other, but the beaming
expressions scarcely needed literal interpretation. Truth makes
it necessary to add that, with all this effusiveness, the warriors
distrusted each other.</p>

<p>Now began a conversation by means of signs, which it would be
tedious to give in full. Fortunately for Hay-uta, he was so far
removed from the scene of action in which Deerfoot and the others
were playing such an active part, that he was quite secure against
interruption, unless the fleeing Shawanoe should happen to take
a turn in his flight which might bring the swarming pursuers in
that direction.</p>

<p>It was impossible for Hay-uta to know the real sentiments of
the other, but, as a matter of precaution, he sought to draw him
further away from the theater of action. The Pawnee must have
understood, from the signals which had reached him, that an enemy
was making a great stir, and that his own presence was desired.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as the Sauk was a stranger, the natural supposition
would be that he was an ally of the enemy. This could not fail
to cause suspicion, but, having just vowed eternal friendship,
policy required him to conceal his real sentiments.</p>

<p>On the invitation of the Sauk, the other accompanied him a few
rods, during which they conversed as well as they could in pantomime.
While they managed to communicate a great deal, yet the limit
was speedily reached. When Hay-uta tried to ask after the missing
Otto, the other did not comprehend him, or, if he did, failed
to make his sentences clear. In that respect, therefore, the mission
of the Sauk was as barren of results as was that of Deerfoot.</p>

<p>The Pawnee had not gone far, when he seemed to awake to the fact
that he was doing an imprudent thing. He came to a halt and showed
by his manner that he would go no further. Hay-uta could not urge
him, and the two, therefore, stood face to face in the depth of
the forest, while they talked to each other.</p>

<p>The Sauk asked himself more than once whether, in a hand to hand
fight with the other, the struggle being fair on each side, he
could vanquish him. The Pawnee was tall, well-formed, athletic,
and the knife thrust in the skin-sheath at his girdle looked as
if it was longer and keener than the one Hay-uta carried, without
sheath at all. The Pawnee was certain to be a formidable antagonist
in such a contest, but the Sauk would not have hesitated to assail
him, except through fear that others would be brought to the spot.</p>

<p>No doubt the Pawnee took the measure of the stranger in the same
manner, and it is reasonable to conclude that he felt no special
fear of him. In fact, the two were like a couple of bull dogs,
ready to fly at each other's throat, without once thinking of
what the issue was likely to be.</p>

<p>But while they were holding their conversation, the Sauk carried
out a singular thought. He asked himself whether he could not
make a friend of the stranger&mdash;that is to say, a genuine friend,
who would be held to him by gratitude.</p>

<p>As to the method by which this was to be attained, even the ingenious
mind of the warrior was unable to determine. All he could do was
to seek to keep him company until some way should be open. The
coming of any of the Pawnees, who were trooping at the heels of
the Shawanoe, would be liable to scatter all such plans to the
wind.</p>

<p>The diplomats were doing their best to entertain each other,
when a most unlooked-for interference took place.</p>

<p>From where they stood, they were able to locate the clearing
by means of a thinness of the trees, a few more rays of daylight
penetrating from that direction. Hay-uta happened to be looking
toward that point, when he caught the outline of a figure stealing
along the margin of the opening.</p>

<p>The sight was so unexpected that the manner of the Sauk betrayed
the discovery, the instance being one of those rare ones in which
he was caught off his guard. He reproached himself, for the back
of his companion was turned toward the other, who was moving as
silently as the shadow over the face of a sun-dial.</p>

<p>The head of the Pawnee turned quickly, and he muttered a soft
"&mdash;st!" At the same moment he began moving toward the other, with
the absolute silence that the trained Indian shows when creeping
into a hostile camp, where the rustling of a leaf brings discovery.</p>

<p>Hay-uta could not but admire the skill of the Indian. At the
same time, the action of the Pawnee in moving away from the Sauk,
while his eyes were turned from him, thus placing himself at the
mercy of Hay-uta, was an appeal to the honor of the latter, which,
of itself, was the strongest safeguard of the Pawnee.</p>

<p>Hay-uta fell in behind him, and the two advanced in their stealthy
fashion among the trees for some twenty steps, when they gained
full view of the third Indian, whose course was rather peculiar.
He had stepped from the woods into the clearing, and was standing
facing the other way, with his attention fixed on something too
far off to be seen by the couple that were watching him.</p>

<p>Hay-uta was astounded almost into betraying himself again when
he saw that the Indian was Deerfoot the Shawanoe. He was watching
the two Pawnees near the camp-fire, and was in the act of discharging
the first arrow which broke the pipe of Red Wolf and threw him
and Lone Bear into such consternation.</p>

<p>It may have been because the youth carried a bow and arrow, instead
of firearms, that the Pawnee thought he was a wanderer from beyond
the Rocky Mountains, who had drifted into that section and was
now making his way home. Certainly he could have had no suspicion
of the prowess of the Shawanoe, nor could he have dreamed that
he had been the sole cause of the hubbub that had reigned among
the Pawnees, and even then was hardly ended. He appeared to believe,
however, that he was one of a party who were their enemies, for
he signed to Hay-uta that he meant that the stranger should not
escape him.</p>
