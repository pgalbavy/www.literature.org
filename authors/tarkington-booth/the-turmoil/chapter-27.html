<p>Mrs. Sheridan, in a wrapper, noiselessly opened the door of her
husband's room at daybreak the next morning, and peered within
the darkened chamber. At the "old" house they had shared a room,
but the architect had chosen to separate them at the New, and
they had not known how to formulate an objection, although to
both of them something seemed vaguely reprehensible in the new
arrangement.</p>

<p>Sheridan did not stir, and she was withdrawing her head from
the aperture when he spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm <em>AWAKE! </em>Come in, if you want to, and shut the
door."</p>

<p>She came and sat by the bed. "I woke up thinkin' about it," she
explained. "And the more I thought about it the surer I got I
must be right, and I knew you'd be tormentin' yourself if you
was awake, so&mdash;well, you got plenty other troubles, but I'm just
sure you ain't goin' to have the worry with Bibbs it looks like."</p>

<p>"You <em>BET I </em>ain't!" he grunted.</p>

<p>"Look how biddable he was about goin' back to the Works," she
continued. "He's a right good-hearted boy, really, and sometimes
I honestly have to say he seems right smart, too. Now and then
he'll say something sounds right bright. 'Course, most always
it doesn't, and a good deal of the time, when he says things,
why, I have to feel glad we haven't got company, because they'd
think he didn't have any gumption at all. Yet, look at the way
he did when Jim&mdash;when Jim got hurt. He took right hold o' things.
'Course he'd been sick himself so much and all&mdash;and the rest of
us never had, much, and we were kind o' green about what to do
in that kind o' trouble&mdash;still, he did take hold, and everything
went off all right; you'll have to say that much, papa. And Dr.
Gurney says he's got brains, and you can't deny but what the doctor's
right considerable of a man. He acts sleepy, but that's only because
he's got such a large practice&mdash;he's a pretty wide-awake kind
of a man some ways. Well, what he says last night about Bibbs
himself bein' asleep, and how much he'd amount to if he ever woke
up&mdash;that's what I got to thinkin' about. You heard him, papa;
he says, 'Bibbs'll be a bigger business man than what Jim and
Roscoe was put together&mdash;if he ever wakes up,' he says. Wasn't
that exactly what he says?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Sheridan, without exhibiting any interest.
"Gurney's crazier'n Bibbs, but if he wasn't&mdash;if what he says was
true&mdash;what of it?"</p>

<p>"Listen, papa. Just suppose Bibbs took it into his mind to get
married. You know where he goes all the time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, yes!" Sheridan turned over in the bed, his face to
the wall, leaving visible of himself only the thick grizzle of
his hair. "You better go back to sleep. He runs over there&mdash;every
minute she'll let him, I suppose. Go back to bed. There's nothin'
in it."</p>

<p>"<em>WHY </em>ain't there?" she urged. "I know better&mdash;there
is, too! You wait and see. There's just one thing in the world
that'll wake the sleepiest young man alive up&mdash;yes, and make him
<em>JUMP </em>up&mdash;and I don't care who he is or how sound asleep
it looks like he is. That's when he takes it into his head to
pick out some girl and settle down and have a home and chuldern
of his own. <em>THEN, I </em>guess, he'll go out after the money!
You'll see. I've known dozens o' cases, and so've you&mdash;moony,
no-'count young men, all notions and talk, goin' to be ministers,
maybe or something; and there's just this one thing takes it out
of 'em and brings 'em right down to business. Well, I never could
make out just what it is Bibbs wants to be, really; doesn't seem
he wants to be a minister exactly&mdash;he's so far-away you can't
tell, and he never <em>SAYS&mdash;</em>but I know this is goin' to
get him right down to common sense. Now, I don't say that Bibbs
has got the idea in his head yet&mdash;'r else he wouldn't be talkin'
that fool-talk about nine dollars a week bein' good enough for
him to live on. But it's <em>COMIN', </em>papa, and he'll <em>JUMP
</em>for whatever you want to hand him out. He will! And I can
tell you this much, too: he'll want all the salary and stock he
can get hold of, and he'll hustle to keep gettin' more. That girl's
the kind that a young husband just goes crazy to give things to!
She's pretty and fine-lookin', and things look nice on her, and
I guess she'd like to have 'em about as well as the next. And
I guess she isn't gettin' many these days, either, and she'll
be pretty ready for the change. I saw her with her sleeves rolled
up at the kitchen window the other day, and Jackson told me yesterday
their cook left two weeks ago, and they haven't tried to hire
another one. He says her and her mother been doin' the housework
a good while, and now they're doin' the cookin,' too. 'Course
Bibbs wouldn't know that unless she's told him, and I reckon she
wouldn't; she's kind o' stiffish-lookin', and Bibbs is too up
in the clouds to notice anything like that for himself. They've
never asked him to a meal in the house, but he wouldn't notice
that, either&mdash;he's kind of innocent. Now I was thinkin'&mdash;you know,
I don't suppose we've hardly mentioned the girl's name at table
since Jim went, but it seems to me maybe if&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sheridan flung out his arms, uttering a sound half-groan, half-yawn.
"You're barkin' up the wrong tree! Go on back to bed, mamma!"</p>

<p>"Why am I?" she demanded, crossly. "Why am I barkin' up the wrong
tree?"</p>

<p>"Because you are. There's nothin' in it."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you," she said, rising&mdash;"I'll bet you he goes to church
with her this morning. What you want to bet?"</p>

<p>"Go back to bed," he commanded. "I <em>KNOW </em>what I'm talkin'
about; there's nothin' in it, I tell you."</p>

<p>She shook her head perplexedly. "You think because&mdash;because Jim
was runnin' so much with her it wouldn't look right?"</p>

<p>"No. Nothin' to do with it."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;do you know something about it that you ain't told me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," he grunted. "Now go on. Maybe I can get a little
sleep. I ain't had any yet!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" She went to the door, her expression downcast. "I thought
maybe&mdash;but&mdash;" She coughed prefatorily. "Oh, papa, something else
I wanted to tell you. I was talkin' to Roscoe over the 'phone
last night when the telegram came, so I forgot to tell you, but&mdash;well,
Sibyl wants to come over this afternoon. Roscoe says she has something
she wants to say to us. It'll be the first time she's been out
since she was able to sit up&mdash;and I reckon she wants to tell us
she's sorry for what happened. They expect to get off by the end
o' the week, and I reckon she wants to feel she's done what she
could to kind o' make up. Anyway, that's what he said. I 'phoned
him again about Edith, and he said it wouldn't disturb Sibyl,
because she'd been expectin' it; she was sure all along it was
goin' to happen; and, besides, I guess she's got all that foolishness
pretty much out of her, bein' so sick. But what I thought was,
no use bein' rough with her, papa &mdash;I expect she's suffered
a good deal&mdash;and I don't think we'd ought to be, on Roscoe's account.
You'll&mdash;you'll be kind o' polite to her, won't you, papa?"</p>

<p>He mumbled something which was smothered under the coverlet he
had pulled over his head.</p>

<p>"What?" she said, timidly. "I was just sayin' I hoped you'd treat
Sibyl all right when she comes, this afternoon. You will, won't
you, papa?"</p>

<p>He threw the coverlet off furiously. "I presume so!" he roared.</p>

<p>She departed guiltily.</p>

<p>But if he had accepted her proffered wager that Bibbs would go
to church with Mary Vertrees that morning, Mrs. Sheridan would
have lost. Nevertheless, Bibbs and Mary did certainly set out
from Mr. Vertrees's house with the purpose of going to church.
That was their intention, and they had no other. They meant to
go to church.</p>

<p>But it happened that they were attentively preoccupied in a conversation
as they came to the church; and though Mary was looking to the
right and Bibbs was looking to the left, Bibbs's leftward glance
converged with Mary's rightward glance, and neither was looking
far beyond the other at this time. It also happened that, though
they were a little jostled among groups of people in the vicinity
of the church, they passed this somewhat prominent edifice without
being aware of their proximity to it, and they had gone an incredible
number of blocks beyond it before they discovered their error.
However, feeling that they might be embarrassingly late if they
returned, they decided that a walk would make them as good. It
was a windless winter morning, with an inch of crisp snow over
the ground. So they walked, and for the most part they were silent,
but on their way home, after they had turned back at noon, they
began to be talkative again.</p>

<p>"Mary," said Bibbs, after a time, "am I a sleep-walker?"</p>

<p>She laughed a little, then looked grave. "Does your father say
you are?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;when he's in a mood to flatter me. Other times, other names.
He has quite a list."</p>

<p>"You mustn't mind," she said, gently. "He's been getting some
pretty severe shocks. What you've told me makes me pretty sorry
for him, Bibbs. I've always been sure he's very big."</p>

<p>"Yes. Big and&mdash;blind. He's like a Hercules without eyes and without
any consciousness except that of his strength and of his purpose
to grow stronger. Stronger for what? For nothing."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Bibbs? It <em>CAN'T </em>be for nothing; it must
be stronger for something, even though he doesn't know what it
is. Perhaps what he and his kind are struggling for is something
so great they <em>COULDN'T </em>see it&mdash;so great none of us could
see it."</p>

<p>"No, he's just like some blind, unconscious thing heaving underground&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Till he breaks through and leaps out into the daylight," she
finished for him, cheerily.</p>

<p>"Into the smoke," said Bibbs. "Look at the powder of coal-dust
already dirtying the decent snow, even though it's Sunday. That's
from the little pigs; the big ones aren't so bad, on Sunday! There's
a fleck of soot on your cheek. Some pig sent it out into the air;
he might as well have thrown it on you. It would have been braver,
for then he'd have taken his chance of my whipping him for it
if I could."</p>

<p>"IS there soot on my cheek, Bibbs, or were you only saying so
rhetorically? IS there?"</p>

<p>"Is there? There <em>ARE </em>soot on your cheeks, Mary&mdash;a fleck
on each. One landed since I mentioned the first."</p>

<p>She halted immediately, giving him her handkerchief, and he succeeded
in transferring most of the black from her face to the cambric.
They were entirely matter-of-course about it.</p>

<p>An elderly couple, it chanced, had been walking behind Bibbs
and Mary for the last block or so, and passed ahead during the
removal of the soot. "There!" said the elderly wife. "You're always
wrong when you begin guessing about strangers. Those two young
people aren't honeymooners at all&mdash;they've been married for years.
A blind man could see that."</p>

<p>"I wish I did know who threw that soot on you," said Bibbs, looking
up at the neighboring chimneys, as they went on. "They arrest
children for throwing snowballs at the street-cars, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they don't arrest the street-cars for shaking all the pictures
in the houses crooked every time they go by. Nor for the uproar
they make. I wonder what's the cost in nerves for the noise of
the city each year. Yes, we pay the price for living in a 'growing
town,' whether we have money to pay or none."</p>

<p>"Who is it gets the pay?" said Bibbs.</p>

<p>"Not I!" she laughed.</p>

<p>"Nobody gets it. There isn't any pay; there's only money. And
only some of the men down-town get much of that. That's what my
father wants me to get."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, smiling to him, and nodding. "And you don't
want it, and you don't need it."</p>

<p>"But you don't think I'm a sleep-walker, Mary?" He had told her
of his father's new plans for him, though he had not described
the vigor and picturesqueness of their setting forth. "You think
I'm right?"</p>

<p>"A thousand times!" she cried. "There aren't so many happy people
in this world, I think&mdash;and you say you've found what makes you
happy. If it's a dream&mdash;keep it!"</p>

<p>"The thought of going down there&mdash;into the money shuffle &mdash;I
hate it as I never hated the shop!" he said. "I hate it! And the
city itself, the city that the money shuffle has made&mdash;just look
at it! Look at it in winter. The snow's tried hard to make the
ugliness bearable, but the ugliness is winning; it's making the
snow hideous; the snow's getting dirty on top, and it's foul underneath
with the dirt and disease of the unclean street. And the dirt
and the ugliness and the rush and the noise aren't the worst of
it; it's what the dirt and ugliness and rush and noise <em>MEAN&mdash;</em>that's
the worst! The outward things are insufferable, but they're only
the expression of a spirit&mdash;a blind embryo of a spirit, not yet
a soul&mdash;oh, just greed! And this 'go ahead' nonsense! Oughtn't
it all to be a fellowship? I shouldn't want to get ahead if I
could &mdash;I'd want to help the other fellow to keep up with
me."</p>

<p>"I read something the other day and remembered it for you," said
Mary. "It was something Burne-Jones said of a picture he was going
to paint: 'In the first picture I shall make a man walking in
the street of a great city, full of all kinds of happy life: children,
and lovers walking, and ladies leaning from the windows all down
great lengths of a street leading to the city walls; and there
the gates are wide open, letting in a space of green field and
cornfield in harvest; and all round his head a great rain of swirling
autumn leaves blowing from a little walled graveyard."</p>

<p>"And if I painted," Bibbs returned, "I'd paint a lady walking
in the street of a great city, full of all kinds of uproarious
and futile life&mdash;children being taught only how to make money,
and lovers hurrying to get richer, and ladies who'd given up trying
to wash their windows clean, and the gates of the city wide open,
letting in slums and slaughter-houses and freight-yards, and all
round this lady's head a great rain of swirling soot&mdash;" He paused,
adding, thoughtfully: "And yet I believe I'm glad that soot got
on your cheek. It was just as if I were your brother&mdash;the way
you gave me your handkerchief to rub it off for you. Still, Edith
never&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Didn't she?" said Mary, as he paused again.</p>

<p>"No. And <em>I&mdash;" </em>He contented himself with shaking his
head instead of offering more definite information. Then he realized
that they were passing the New House, and he sighed profoundly.
"Mary, our walk's almost over."</p>

<p>She looked as blank. "So it is, Bibbs."</p>

<p>They said no more until they came to her gate. As they drifted
slowly to a stop, the door of Roscoe's house opened, and Roscoe
came out with Sibyl, who was startlingly pale. She seemed little
enfeebled by her illness, however, walking rather quickly at her
husband's side and not taking his arm. The two crossed the street
without appearing to see Mary and her companion, and entering
the New House, were lost to sight. Mary gazed after them gravely,
but Bibbs, looking at Mary, did not see them.</p>

<p>"Mary," he said, "you seem very serious. Is anything bothering
you?"</p>

<p>"No, Bibbs." And she gave him a bright, quick look that made
him instantly unreasonably happy.</p>

<p>"I know you want to go in&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"No. I don't want to."</p>

<p>"I mustn't keep you standing here, and I mustn't go in with you&mdash;but
&mdash;I just wanted to say &mdash;I've seemed very stupid to
myself this morning, grumbling about soot and all that&mdash;while
all the time I &mdash;Mary, I think it's been the very happiest
of all the hours you've given me. I do. And &mdash;I don't know
just why&mdash;but it's seemed to me that it was one I'd always remember.
And you," he added, falteringly, "you look so&mdash;so beautiful to-day!"</p>

<p>"It must have been the soot on my cheek, Bibbs."</p>

<p>"Mary, will you tell me something?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think I will."</p>

<p>"It's something I've had a lot of theories about, but none of
them ever just fits. You used to wear furs in the fall, but now
it's so much colder, you don't&mdash;you never wear them at all any
more. Why don't you?"</p>

<p>Her eyes fell for a moment, and she grew red. Then she looked
up gaily. "Bibbs, if I tell you the answer will you promise not
to ask any more questions?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why did you stop wearing them?"</p>

<p>"Because I found I'd be warmer without them!" She caught his
hand quickly in her own for an instant, laughed into his eyes,
and ran into the house.</p>
