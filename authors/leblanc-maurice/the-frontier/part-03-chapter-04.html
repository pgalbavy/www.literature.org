<p>"Bugler!... Sound the rally ... at the double ... and quietly."
</p><p>It was Captain Daspry who now arrived, with a brisk gait, but with the
grave and resolute face of a leader who is commanding at a solemn
moment.
</p><p>He said to Philippe:
</p><p>"Is M. Morestal still unwell?"
</p><p>Mme. Morestal ran out from the house:
</p><p>"My husband is asleep.... He is very tired.... The morphia.... But, if
there is anything you want, I can take his place. I know his intentions,
his preparations."
</p><p>"We shall attempt the impossible," said the officer. And, addressing his
lieutenant, he added, "It would have been madness to stay over there,
wouldn't it, Fabrègues? It's not a question of demolishing a few Uhlans,
as we did, but of standing our ground against a whole brigade who were
climbing the other slope.... Oh, it was all planned long ago!... And M.
Morestal is a jolly clever man!..."
</p><p>The bugle sounded a low call and the Alpine Rifles emerged from every
side, through the terrace, the garden and the back entrances.
</p><p>"That will do!" said the officer to the bugler. "They have heard ... and
I don't want the enemy to hear as well."
</p><p>He took out his watch:
</p><p>"Twelve o'clock.... Two hours more, at least.... Oh, if I only had
twenty-five minutes or half an hour in which to prepare my
resistance.... But nothing will stop them.... The passage is free...."
</p><p>He called:
</p><p>"Fabrègues!"
</p><p>"Yes, captain."
</p><p>"All the men in front of the coach-house, on the left of the garden. At
the back of the coach-house is a hay-loft. Break down the door...."
</p><p>"Victor, show the gentleman the way," said Mme. Morestal to the servant.
"Here is the key."
</p><p>"In the loft," continued the captain, "you will find two hundred bags of
plaster.... Use them to block up the parapet of this terrace.... Quick
as you can!... Every minute is worth an hour."
</p><p>He himself went to the parapet, measured it and counted the balusters.
In the distance, within rifle-range, the Col du Diable formed a deep
gash between the great rocks. Saboureux's Farm guarded the entrance. As
yet, not a single figure of the enemy showed.
</p><p>"Ah, twenty minutes!... If I only had twenty minutes!" repeated the
officer. "The position of the Old Mill is hard to beat. One would stand
a chance or two ..."
</p><p>An adjutant and a couple more soldiers appeared at the top of the
staircase.
</p><p>"Well?" asked Captain Daspry. "Are they coming?"
</p><p>"The vanguard was turning the corner of the factory, at five hundred
yards from the pass," replied the adjutant.
</p><p>"Are there any more of our men behind you?"
</p><p>"Yes, captain, there's Duvauchel. He's wounded. They've laid him on a
stretcher...."
</p><p>"Duvauchel!" cried the officer, anxiously. "It's not a serious wound, I
hope?"
</p><p>"Upon my word ... I shouldn't like to say."
</p><p>"Dash it all! But then one saw nothing but that devil in the front
line.... There was no holding him...."
</p><p>"Yes," chuckled the adjutant, "he has a way of his own of deserting in
the face of the enemy!... He charges straight at them, the beggar!"
</p><p>But Mme. Morestal grew frightened:
</p><p>"A man wounded! I will go and prepare some bandages, get out the
medicine-chest.... We have all that's wanted.... Will you come, Marthe?"
</p><p>"Yes, mother," replied Marthe, without budging.
</p><p>She did not remove her eyes from her husband and tried to read on
Philippe's face the feelings that stirred him. She had first of all seen
him go back to the drawing-room and cross the entrance-hall, as though
he were thinking of the way out through the garden, which was still
free. The sudden arrival of the riflemen pushed him back; and he talked
to several of them in a low voice and gave them some bread and a flask
of brandy. Then he returned to the terrace. His inaction, in the midst
of the constant traffic to and fro, was obviously irksome to him. Twice
he consulted the drawing-room clock; and Marthe guessed that he was
thinking of the hour of the train and the time which he would need to
reach Langoux Station. But she did not alarm herself. Every second was
weaving bonds around him that tied him down without his knowing it; and
it seemed to Marthe as though events had no other object than to make
her husband's departure impossible.
</p><p>The resistance, meanwhile, was being organized. Swiftly, the riflemen
brought the bags of plaster, which the captain at once ordered to be
placed between every pair of balusters. Each of the bags was of the
height and width corresponding with the dimensions of the intervals and
left an empty space, a loop-hole, on either side. And old Morestal had
even had the forethought to match the colour of the sacking with that of
the parapet, so that it might not be suspected in the distance that
there was a defence behind which sharpshooters lay hidden.
</p><p>On either side of the terrace, the wall surrounding the garden was the
object of similar cares. The captain ordered the soldiers to set out
bags at the foot of the wall so as to make the top accessible from the
inside.
</p><p>But a sound of shouting recalled the captain to the drawing-room. The
gardener's son came tumbling down from his observatory, yelling:
</p><p>"Saboureux's Farm is on fire! You can see the smoke! You can see the
flames!"
</p><p>The captain leapt out on the terrace.
</p><p>The smoke was whirling above the barn. Gleams kindled, faint as yet and
hesitating. And, suddenly, as though set free, the flames shot up in
angry spirals. The wind at once beat them down again. The roof of the
house took fire. And, in a few minutes, it was a violent flare,
accompanied by the quick blaze of the rotten beams, the dry thatch, the
trusses of hay and straw heaped up by the hundred in the barn and in the
sheds.
</p><p>"To work!" shouted the captain, gleefully. "The Col du Diable is blocked
by the flames.... They'll last for quite fifteen or twenty minutes ...
and the enemy have no other road...."
</p><p>His excitement communicated itself to the men. Not one of them broke
down beneath the weight of the bags, heavy though these were. The
captain posted the non-commissioned officers at regular intervals, so
that his orders could be passed on from the terrace to every end of the
property.
</p><p>Lieutenant Fabrègues came up. The materials were beginning to fall short
and the lofty wall remained inaccessible to the marksmen in several
places.
</p><p>Mme. Morestal behaved like a heroine:
</p><p>"Take the furniture, captain, the chairs, the tables. Break them up, if
necessary.... Burn them even.... Do just as if my husband were here."
</p><p>"M. Morestal said something about a stock of cartridges," asked the
captain.
</p><p>"In the boxes in the harness-room. Here are the keys."
</p><p>The men redoubled their activity. The Old Mill was ransacked; and the
soldiers passed laden with mattresses, sofas, old oak chests, hangings
also and carpets, with which they stopped up the holes and the windows.
</p><p>"The flames are spreading," said the captain, going to the top of the
staircase. "There's nothing left of Farmer Saboureux's buildings.... But
by what miracle ...? Who set the place on fire?..."
</p><p>"I did."
</p><p>A peasant stood at the top of the steps, in a scorched blouse, with his
face all blackened.
</p><p>"You, Saboureux?"
</p><p>"Yes, I," growled Saboureux, fiercely. "I had to.... I heard you over
there: 'If we could only stop them,' says you. 'If I had half an hour to
spare!'... Well, there's your half an hour for you.... I set fire to
the shanty."
</p><p>"And very nearly roasted me inside it," grinned Old Poussière, who was
with the farmer. "I was asleep in the straw...."
</p><p>The captain nodded his head:
</p><p>"By Jove, Farmer Saboureux, but that's a damned sportsmanlike thing
you've done! I formed a wrong opinion of you. I apologize. May I shake
you by the hand?"
</p><p>The peasant put out his hand and then walked away, with his back bent in
two. He sat down in a corner of the drawing-room. Poussière also huddled
into a chair, took a piece of bread from his pocket, broke it and gave
half to Saboureux, as though he thought it only natural to share what he
had with the man who had nothing left.
</p><p>"Here's Duvauchel, sir!" announced a rifleman. "Here's Duvauchel!"
</p><p>The staircase was too narrow and they had to bring the stretcher round
by the garden. The captain ran to meet the wounded man, who made an
effort to stand on his legs:
</p><p>"What's up, Duvauchel? Are you hit?"
</p><p>"Not I, sir, not I," said the man, whose face was livid and his eyes
burning with fever. "A cherry-stone tickled my shoulder, by way of a
lark. It's nothing...."
</p><p>"But the blood's flowing...."
</p><p>"It's nothing, I tell you, sir.... I know all about it.... Saw plenty of
it as a greaser!... It won't show in five minutes ... and then I'm
off...."
</p><p>"Oh, of course, I forgot, you're deserting!..."
</p><p>"Rather! The comrades are waiting for me...."
</p><p>"Then begin by getting your wound dressed...."
</p><p>"My wound dressed? Oh, that's a good one! I tell you, sir, it's nothing
... less than nothing ... a kiss ... a puff of wind...."
</p><p>He stood up for an instant, but his eyelids flickered, his hands sought
for support and he fell back upon the litter.
</p><p>Mme. Morestal and Marthe hastened to his side:
</p><p>"Let me, mamma, please," said Marthe, "I'm used to it.... But you've
forgotten the absorbent wool ... and the peroxide of hydrogen.... Quick,
mamma ... and more bandages, lots of bandages...."
</p><p>Mme. Morestal went out. Marthe bent over the wounded man and felt his
pulse without delay:
</p><p>"Quite right, it's nothing," she said. "The artery is uninjured."
</p><p>She uncovered the wound and, very tenderly, staunched the blood that
trickled from it:
</p><p>"The peroxide, quick, mamma."
</p><p>She took the bottle which some one held out to her and, raising her
head, saw Suzanne stooping like herself over the wounded man.
</p><p>"M. Morestal is waking up," said the girl. "Mme. Morestal sent me in her
stead...."
</p><p>Marthe did not so much as start. She did not even feel as though an
unpleasant memory had flitted through her mind, compelling her to make
an effort to suppress her hatred:
</p><p>"Unroll the bandages," she said.
</p><p>And Suzanne also was calm in the face of her enemy. No sense of shame or
embarrassment troubled her. Their mingled breath caressed the soldier's
face.
</p><p>Nor did it seem that any memory of love existed between Philippe and
Suzanne or that a carnal bond united them. They looked at each other
unmoved. Marthe herself told Philippe to uncork a bottle of boracic. He
did so. His hand touched Suzanne's. Neither he nor Suzanne felt a
thrill.
</p><p>Around them continued the uninterrupted work of the men, each of whom
obeyed orders and executed them according to his own initiative, without
fuss or confusion. The servants were all in the drawing-room. The women
aided in the work. Amid the great anguish that oppressed every heart at
the first formidable breath of war, no one thought of anything but his
individual task, that contribution of heroism which fate was claiming
from one and all. What mattered the petty wounds of pride, the petty
griefs to which the subtleties of love give rise! What signified the
petty treacheries of daily life!
</p><p>"He's better," said Marthe. "Here, Suzanne, let him sniff at the
smelling-salts."
</p><p>Duvauchel opened his eyes. He saw Marthe and Suzanne, smiled and
murmured:
</p><p>"By Jingo!... It was worth while!... Duvauchel's a lucky dog!..."
</p><p>But an unexpected silence fell upon the great drawing-room, like a
spontaneous cessation of all the organs at work. And, suddenly, a voice
was heard on the threshold:
</p><p>"<u>They</u> have crossed the frontier! Two of them have crossed the
frontier!"
</p><p>And Victor exclaimed:
</p><p>"And there are more coming! You can see their helmets.... They are
coming! They are in France!"
</p><p>The women fell on their knees. One of them moaned:
</p><p>"O God, have pity on us!"
</p><p>Marthe had joined Philippe at the terrace-door and they heard Captain
Daspry repeating in a low voice, with an accent of despair:
</p><p>"Yes, they are in France ... they have crossed the frontier."
</p><p>"They are in France, Philippe," said Marthe, taking her husband's hand.
</p><p>And she felt his hand tremble.
</p><p>Drawing himself up quickly, the captain commanded:
</p><p>"Not a shot!... Let no one show himself!"
</p><p>The order flew from mouth to mouth and silence and immobility reigned in
the Old Mill, from one end to the other of the house and grounds. Each
one stood at his post. All along the wall, the soldiers kept themselves
hidden, perched upright on their improvised talus.
</p><p>At that moment, one of the drawing-room doors opened and old Morestal
appeared on his wife's arm. Dressed in a pair of trousers and a
waistcoat, bare-headed, tangle-haired, with a handkerchief fastened
round his neck, he staggered on his wavering legs. Nevertheless, a sort
of gladness, like an inward smile, lighted his features.
</p><p>"Let me be," he said to his wife, who was endeavouring to support him.
</p><p>He steadied his gait and walked to the gun-rack, where the twelve rifles
stood in a row.
</p><p>He took out one with feverish haste, felt it, with the touch of a
sportsman recognizing his favourite weapon, passed in front of Philippe,
without appearing to see him, and went out on the terrace.
</p><p>"You, M. Morestal!" said Captain Daspry.
</p><p>Pointing to the frontier, the old man asked:
</p><p>"Are they there?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Are you making a resistance?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Are there many of them?"
</p><p>"There are twenty to one."
</p><p>"If so ...?"
</p><p>"We've got to."
</p><p>"But ..."
</p><p>"We've got to, M. Morestal; and be easy, we shall stand our ground....
I'm certain of it."
</p><p>Morestal said, in a low voice:
</p><p>"Remember what I told you, captain.... The road is undermined at two
hundred yards from the terrace.... A match and ..."
</p><p>"Oh," protested the officer, "I hope it won't come to that! I am
expecting relief."
</p><p>"Very well!" said Morestal. "But anything rather than let them come up
to the Old Mill!"
</p><p>"They won't come up. It's out of the question that they should come up
before the arrival of the French troops."
</p><p>"Good! As long as the Old Mill remains in our hands, they won't be able
to man the heights and threaten Saint-Élophe."
</p><p>They could plainly see columns of infantry winding along the Col du
Diable. There, they divided and one part of the men turned towards the
Butte-aux-Loups, while the others--consisting of the greater number, for
this was evidently the enemy's object--went down towards the Étang-des
Moines, to seize the high-road.
</p><p>These disappeared for a moment, hidden by the bend of the ground.
</p><p>The captain said to Morestal:
</p><p>"Once the road is held and the assault begins, it will be impossible to
get away.... It would be better, therefore, for the ladies ... and for
you yourself ..."
</p><p>Morestal gave him such a look that the officer did not insist:
</p><p>"Come, come," he said, smiling, "don't be angry.... Rather help me to
make these good people understand...."
</p><p>He turned to the servants, to Victor, who was taking down a rifle, to
the gardener, to Henriot, and warned them that none but combatants must
stay at the Old Mill, as any man captured with arms in his hands exposed
himself to reprisals.
</p><p>They let him talk; and Victor, without thinking of retiring, answered:
</p><p>"That's as may be, captain. But it's one of the things one doesn't think
about. I'm staying."
</p><p>"And you, Farmer Saboureux? You're running a big risk, if they prove
that you set fire to your farm."
</p><p>"I'm staying," growled the peasant, laconically.
</p><p>"And you, tramp?"
</p><p>Old Poussière had not finished eating the piece of bread which he had
taken from his wallet. He was listening and observing, with eyes wide
open and an evident effort to attend. He examined the captain, his
uniform, the braid upon his sleeve, seemed to reflect on mysterious
things, stood up and seized a rifle.
</p><p>"That's right, Poussière," grinned Morestal. "You know your country
right enough, once it needs defending."
</p><p>A man had made the same movement as the tramp, almost at the same time.
One more division in the gun-rack was empty.
</p><p>It was Duvauchel, still rather unsteady on his pins, but wearing an
undaunted look.
</p><p>"What, Duvauchel!" asked Captain Daspry. "Aren't we deserting?"
</p><p>"You're getting at me, captain! Let the beggars clear out of France
first! I'll desert afterwards."
</p><p>"But you've only one arm that's any good."
</p><p>"A greaser's arm, captain ... and a French greaser's at that ... is
worth two, any day."
</p><p>"Pass me one of them rifles," said the gardener's son. "I know my way
about with 'em."
</p><p>Duvauchel began to laugh:
</p><p>"You too, sonnie? You want one? You'll see, the babes at the breast will
be rising up next, like the others. Lord, but it makes my blood boil to
think that they're in France!"
</p><p>All followed the captain, who allotted them a post along the parapet.
The women busied themselves in placing ammunition within reach of the
marksmen.
</p><p>Marthe was left alone with her husband. She saw that the scene had
stirred him. In the way in which those decent folk realized their duty
and performed it without being compelled to, simply and spontaneously,
there was that sort of greatness which touches a man to the very depths
of his soul.
</p><p>She said to him:
</p><p>"Well, Philippe?"
</p><p>His face was drawn; he did not reply.
</p><p>She continued:
</p><p>"Well, go.... What are you waiting for? No one will notice your
flight.... Be quick.... Take the opportunity while it's here...."
</p><p>They heard the captain addressing his lieutenant:
</p><p>"Keep down your head, Fabrègues, can't you? They'll see you, if you're
not careful...."
</p><p>Marthe seized Philippe's arm and, bending towards him:
</p><p>"Now confess that you can't go ... that all this upsets your notions ...
and that your duty is here ... that you feel it."
</p><p>"There they are! There they are!" said a voice.
</p><p>"Yes," said Captain Daspry, searching the road through the orifice of a
loop-hole, "yes, there they are!... At six hundred yards, at most ...
It's the vanguard.... They are skirting the pool and they haven't a
notion that ..."
</p><p>A sergeant came to tell him that the enemy had hoisted a gun on the
slope of the pass. The officer was alarmed, but old Morestal began to
laugh:
</p><p>"Let them bring up as many guns as they please!... They can only take up
positions which we command and which I have noted. A few good marksmen
are enough to keep them from placing a battery."
</p><p>And, turning to his son, he said to him, quite naturally, as though
nothing had ever parted them:
</p><p>"Are you coming, Philippe? We'll demolish them between us."
</p><p>Captain Daspry interfered:
</p><p>"Don't fire! We are not discovered yet. Wait till I give the order....
There'll be time enough later...."
</p><p>Old Morestal had moved away.
</p><p>Philippe walked resolutely towards the gate that led to the garden, to
the open country. But he had not taken ten steps, when he stopped. He
seemed to be vaguely suffering; and Marthe, who had not left his side,
Marthe, anxious, full of mingled hope and apprehension, watched every
phase of the tragic struggle:
</p><p>"All the past is calling on you, Philippe; all the love for France that
the past has bequeathed to you. Listen to its voice."
</p><p>And, replying to every possible objection:
</p><p>"Yes, I know, your intelligence rebels against it. But is one's
intelligence everything?... Obey your instinct, Philippe.... It's your
instinct that is right."
</p><p>"No, no," he stammered, "one's instinct is never right...."
</p><p>"It is right. But for that, you would be far away by now. But you can't
go. Your whole being refuses to go. Your legs have not the strength for
flight."
</p><p>The Col du Diable was pouring forth troops and more troops, whose
swarming masses showed along the slope. Others must be coming by the
Albern Road; and, on every side, along every path and through every gap,
the men of Germany were invading the soil of France.
</p><p>The vanguard reached the high-road, at the end of the Étang-des-Moines.
</p><p>There was a dull roll of the drum; and, suddenly, in the near silence, a
hoarse voice barked out a German word of command.
</p><p>Philippe started as though he had been struck.
</p><p>And Marthe clung to him, pitilessly:
</p><p>"Do you hear, Philippe? Do you understand? The German speech on French
soil! Their language forced upon us!"
</p><p>"Oh, no!" he said. "That can't be.... That will never be!"
</p><p>"Why should it never be? Invasion comes first ... and then conquest ...
and subjection...."
</p><p>Near them, the captain ordered:
</p><p>"Let no one stir!"
</p><p>Bullets spluttered against the walls, while the sounds of firing
reverberated. A window-pane was smashed on the floor above. And more
bullets broke fragments of stone from the coping of the parapet. The
enemy, surprised at the disappearance of the French troops, were feeling
their way before passing below that house, whose gloomy aspect must
needs strike them as suspicious.
</p><p>"Ah!" said a soldier, spinning on his heels and falling on the threshold
of the drawing-room, his face covered with blood.
</p><p>The women ran to his assistance.
</p><p>Philippe gazed haggard-eyed at that man who was about to die, at that
man who belonged to the same race, who lived under the same sky as
himself, who breathed the same air, ate the same bread and drank the
same wine.
</p><p>Marthe had taken down a rifle and handed it to Philippe. He grasped it
with a sort of despair:
</p><p>"Who would ever have told me ...?" he stammered.
</p><p>"I, Philippe ... I was sure of you. We have not to do with theories, but
with implacable facts. These are realities, to-day.... The enemy is
treading the bit of earth where you were born, where you played as a
child. The enemy is forcing his way into France. Defend her,
Philippe...."
</p><p>He clenched his fists around his rifle and she saw that his eyes were
full of tears.
</p><p>He murmured, quivering with inward rebellion:
</p><p>"Our sons will refuse ... I shall teach them to refuse.... What I cannot
do, what I have not the courage to do they shall do."
</p><p>"Perhaps, but what does the future matter!" she said, eagerly. "What
does to-morrow's duty matter! Our duty, yours and mine, is the duty of
to-day."
</p><p>A voice whispered:
</p><p>"They're coming near, captain.... They're coming near...."
</p><p>Another voice, beside Philippe, the voice of one of the women tending
the wounded man, moaned:
</p><p>"He's dead.... Poor fellow!... He's dead...."
</p><p>The guns roared on the frontier.
</p><p>"Are you coming, Philippe?" asked old Morestal.
</p><p>"I'm coming, father," he said.
</p><p>Very quickly, he walked out on the terrace and knelt beside his father,
against the balusters. Marthe knelt down behind him and wept at the
thought of what he must be suffering. Nevertheless, she did not doubt
but that, notwithstanding his despair, he was acting in all conscience.
</p><p>The captain said, clearly, and the order was repeated to the end of the
garden:
</p><p>"Fire as you please.... Sight at three hundred yards...."
</p><p>There were a few seconds of solemn waiting ... then the terrible word:
</p><p>"Fire!"
</p><p>Yonder, along the barrel of his rifle, near an old oak in whose branches
he once used to climb, Philippe saw a great lubber in uniform throw up
his hands, bend his legs one after the other and stretch himself along
the ground, slowly, as though to sleep....
