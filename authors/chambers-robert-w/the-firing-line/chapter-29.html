<p>Two days later as his pretty aunt stood in her chamber shaking
out the chestnut masses of her hair before her mirror, an impatient
rapping at the living-room door sent her maid flying.</p>

<p>"That's Garry," said Constance calmly, belting in her chamber-robe
of silk and twisting up her hair into one heavy lustrous knot.</p>

<p>A moment later they had exchanged salutes and, holding both his
hands in hers, she stood looking at him, golden brown eyes very
tender, cheeks becomingly pink.</p>

<p>"That miserable train is early; it happens once in a century.
I meant to meet you, dear."</p>

<p>"Wayward met me at the station," he said.</p>

<p>There was a silence; under his curious and significant gaze she
flushed, then laughed.</p>

<p>"Wayward said that you had something to tell me," he added....
"Constance, is it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You darling!" he whispered, taking her into his arms. And she
laid her face on his shoulder, crying a little, laughing a little.</p>

<p>"After all these years, Garry&mdash;all these years! It is a long
time to&mdash;to care for a man&mdash;a long, long time.... But there never
was any other&mdash;not even through that dreadful period&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"Yes, you know.... I have cared for him since I was a little
girl."</p>

<p>They stood a while talking tenderly, intimately of her new happiness
and of the new man, Wayward.</p>

<p>Both knew that he must bear his scars for ever, that youth had
died in him. But they were very confident and happy standing there
together in the sunlight which poured into the room, transfiguring
her. And she truly seemed as lovely, radiant, and youthful as
her own young heart, unsullied, innocent, now, as when it yielded
its first love so long ago amid the rosewood and brocades of the
old-time parlour where the sun fell across the faded roses of
the carpet.</p>

<p>"I knew it was so from the way he shook hands," said Hamil, smiling.
"How well he looks, Constance! And as for you&mdash;you are a real
beauty!"</p>

<p>"You <em>don't</em> think so! But say it, Garry.... And now I
think I had better retire and complete this unceremonious toilet....
And you may stroll over to pay your respects to Mrs. Cardross
in the meanwhile if you choose."</p>

<p>He looked at her gravely. She nodded. "They all know you are
due to-day."</p>

<p>"Shiela?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Be careful, Garry; she is very young after all.... I
think&mdash;if I were you &mdash;I would not even seem conscious that
she had been ill&mdash;that anything had happened to interrupt your
friendship. She is very sensitive, very deeply sensible of the
dreadful mistake she made, and, somehow, I think she is a little
afraid of you, as though you might possibly think less of her
&mdash;Heaven knows what ideas the young conjure to worry themselves
and those they care for!"</p>

<p>She laughed, kissed him and bowed him out; and he went away to
bathe and change into cool clothing of white serge.</p>

<p>Later as he passed through the gardens, a white oleander blossom
fell, and he picked it up and drew it through his coat.</p>

<p>Shadows of palm and palmetto stretched westward across the white
shell road, striping his path; early sunlight crinkled the lagoon;
the little wild ducks steered fearlessly inshore, peering up at
him with bright golden-irised eyes; mullet jumped heavily, tumbling
back into the water with splashes that echoed through the morning
stillness.</p>

<p>The stained bronze cannon still poked their ancient and flaring
muzzles out over the lake; farther along crimson hibiscus blossoms
blazed from every hedge; and above him the stately plumes of royal
palms hung motionless, tufting the trunks, which rose with the
shaft-like dignity of slender Egyptian pillars into a cloudless
sky.</p>

<p>On he went, along endless hedges of azalea and oleander, past
thickets of Spanish-bayonet, under leaning cocoanut-palms; and
at last the huge banyan-tree rose sprawling across the sky-line,
and he saw the white facades and red-tiled roofs beyond.</p>

<p>All around him now, as the air grew sweet with the breath of
orange blossoms, a subtler scent, delicately persistent, came
to him on the sea-wind; and he remembered it!&mdash;the lilac perfume
of China-berry in bloom; Calypso's own immortal fragrance. And,
in the brilliant sunshine, there under green trees with the dome
of blue above, unbidden, the shadows of the past rose up; and
once more lantern-lit faces crowded through the aromatic dark;
once more the fountains' haze drifted across dim lawns; once more
he caught the faint, uncertain rustle of her gown close to him
as she passed like a fresh breath through the dusk.</p>

<p>Overhead a little breeze became entangled in the palmetto fronds,
setting them softly clashing together as though a million unseen
elfin hands were welcoming his return; the big black-and-gold
butterflies, beating up against the sudden air current, flapped
back to their honeyed haven in the orange grove; bold, yellow-eyed
grackle stared at him from the grass; a bird like a winged streak
of flame flashed through the jungle and was gone.</p>

<p>And now every breath he drew was quickening his pulses with the
sense of home-coming; he saw the red-bellied woodpeckers sticking
like shreds of checked gingham to the trees, turning their pointed
heads incuriously as he passed; the welling notes of a wren bubbled
upward through the sun-shot azure; high in the vault above an
eagle was passing seaward, silver of tail and crest, winged with
bronze; and everywhere on every side glittered the gold-and-saffron
dragon-flies of the South like the play of sunbeams on a green
lagoon.</p>

<p>Under the sapodilla-trees on the lawn two aged, white-clad negro
servants were gathering fruit forbidden them; and at sight of
him two wrinkled black hands furtively wiped two furrowed faces
free from incriminating evidence; two solemn pairs of eyes rolled
piously in his direction.</p>

<p>"Mohnin', suh, Mistuh Hamil."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Jonas; good morning, Archimedes. Mr. Cardross
is in the orange grove, I see."</p>

<p>And, smiling, passed the guilty ones with a humorously threatening
shake of his head.</p>

<p>A black boy, grinning, opened the gate; the quick-stepping figure
in white flannels glanced around at the click of the latch.</p>

<p>"Hamil! Good work! I am glad to see you!"&mdash;his firm, sun-burnt
hands closing over Hamil's&mdash;"glad all through!"</p>

<p>"Not as glad as I am, Mr. Cardross&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. Why didn't you come before? The weather has been
heavenly; everybody wanted you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Everybody</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, of course!... Well, look here, Hamil, I've no authority
to discuss that matter; but her mother, I think, has made matters
clear to her&mdash;concerning our personal wishes&mdash;ah&mdash;hum&mdash;is that
what you're driving at?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... May I ask her? I came here to ask her."</p>

<p>"We all know that," said Cardross na√Øvely. "Your aunt is a very
fine woman, Hamil.... I don't see why you shouldn't tell Shiela
anything you want to. We all wish it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the younger man. Their hand grip tightened
and parted; shoulder to shoulder they swung into step across the
lawn, Cardross planting his white-shod feet with habitual precision.</p>

<p>His hair and moustache were very white in contrast to the ruddy
sun-burnt skin; and he spoke of his altered appearance with one
of his quick smiles.</p>

<p>"They nearly had me in the panic, Hamil. The Shoshone weathered
the scare by grace of God and my little daughter's generosity.
And it came fast when it came; we were under bare poles, too,
and I didn't expect any cordiality from the Clearing House; but,
Hamil, they classed us with the old-liners, and they acted most
decently. As for my little daughter&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

<p>And to his own and Hamil's embarrassment his clear eyes suddenly
grew dim and he walked forward a step or two winking rapidly at
the sky.</p>

<p>Gray, bare of arm to the shoulder, booted and bare-headed, loped
across the grass on his polo-pony, mallet at salute. Then he leaned
down from his saddle and greeted Hamil with unspoiled enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Shiela is practising and wants you to come over when you can
and see us knock the ball about. It's a rotten field, but you
can't help that down here."</p>

<p>And clapping his spurless heels to his pony he saluted and wheeled
away through the hammock.</p>

<p>On the terrace Mrs. Cardross took his hands in her tremulous
and pudgy fingers.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you are perfectly well, Garry? Don't you think
it safer to begin at once with a mild dose of quinine and follow
it every three hours with a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Amy, dear!" murmured her husband, "I am not dreaming of interfering,
but I, personally, never saw a finer specimen of physical health
than this boy you are preparing to&mdash;be good to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Neville, you know absolutely nothing sometimes," observed his
wife serenely. Then looking up at the tall young man bending over
her chair:</p>

<p>"You won't need as much as you required when you rode into the
swamps every day, but you don't mind my prescribing for you now
and then, do you, Garry?"</p>

<p>"I was going to ask you to do it," he said, looking at Cardross
unblushingly. And at such perfidy the older man turned away with
an unfeigned groan just as Cecile, tennis-bat in hand, came out
from the hall, saw him, dropped the bat, and walked straight into
his arms.</p>

<p>"Cecile," observed her mother mildly.</p>

<p>"But I wish to hug him, mother, and he doesn't mind."</p>

<p>Her mother laughed; Hamil, a trifle red, received a straightforward
salute square on the mouth.</p>

<p>"That," she said with calm conviction, "is the most proper and
fitting thing you and I have ever done. Mother, you know it is."
And passing her arm through Hamil's:</p>

<p>"Last night," she said under her breath, "I went into Shiela's
room to say good-night, and&mdash;and we both began to cry a little.
It was as though I were giving up my controlling ownership in
a dear and familiar possession; we did not speak of you &mdash;I
don't remember that we spoke at all from the time I entered her
room to the time I left&mdash;which was fearfully late. But I knew
that I was giving up some vague proprietary right in her&mdash;that,
to-day, that right would pass to another.... And, if I kissed
you, Garry, it was in recognition of the passing of that right
to you&mdash;and happy acquiescence in it, dear&mdash;believe me! happy,
confident renunciation and gratitude for what must be."</p>

<p>They had walked together to the southern end of the terrace;
below stretched the splendid forest vista set with pool and fountain;
under the parapet, in the new garden, red and white roses bloomed,
and on the surface of spray-dimmed basins the jagged crimson reflections
of goldfish dappled every unquiet pool.</p>

<p>"Where is the new polo field?" he asked.</p>

<p>She pointed out an unfamiliar path curving west from the tennis-courts,
nodded, smiled, returning the pressure of his hand, and stood
watching him from the parapet until he vanished in the shadow
of the trees.</p>

<p>The path was a new one to him, cut during the summer. For a quarter
of a mile it wound through the virgin hammock, suddenly emerging
into a sunny clearing where an old orange grove grown up with
tangles of brier and vine had partly given place to the advance
of the jungle.</p>

<p>Something glimmered over there among the trees&mdash;a girl, coated
and skirted in snowy white, sitting a pony, and leisurely picking
and eating the great black mulberries that weighted the branches
so that they bent almost to the breaking.</p>

<p>She saw him from a distance, turned in her saddle, lifting her
polo-mallet in recognition; and as he came, pushing his way across
the clearing, almost shoulder-deep through weeds, from which the
silver-spotted butterflies rose in clouds, she stripped off one
stained glove, and held out her hand to him.</p>

<p>"You were so long in coming," she managed to say, calmly, "I
thought I'd ride part way back to meet you; and fell a victim
to these mulberries. Tempted and fell, you see.... Are you well?
It is nice to see you."</p>

<p>And as he still retained her slim white hand in both of his:</p>

<p>"What do you think of my new pony?" she asked, forcing a smile.
"He's teaching me the real game.... I left the others when Gray
came up; Cuyp, Phil Gatewood, and some other men are practising.
You'll play to-morrow, won't you? It's such a splendid game."
She was talking at random, now, as though the sound of her own
voice were sustaining her with its nervous informality; and she
chattered on in feverish animation, bridging every threatened
silence with gay inconsequences.</p>

<p>"You play polo, of course? Tell me you do."</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well I don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you'll try if I ask you?"</p>

<p>He still held her hand imprisoned&mdash;that fragrant, listless little
hand, so lifeless, nerveless, unresponsive&mdash;as though it were
no longer a part of her and she had forgotten it.</p>

<p>"I'll do anything you wish," he said slowly.</p>

<p>"Then <em>don't</em> eat any of these mulberries until you are
acclimated. I'm sorry; they are so delicious. But I won't eat
any more, either."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said, bending down a heavily laden bough for her.
"Eat! daughter of Eve! This fruit is highly recommended."</p>

<p>"Oh, Garry! I'm not such a pig as that!... Well, then; if you
make me do it&mdash;"</p>

<p>She lifted her face among the tender leaves, detached a luscious
berry with her lips, absorbed it reflectively, and shook her head
with decision.</p>

<p>The shadow of constraint was fast slipping from them both.</p>

<p>"You know you enjoy it," he insisted, laughing naturally.</p>

<p>"No, I don't enjoy it at all," she retorted indignantly. "I'll
not taste another until you are ready to do your part.... I've
forgotten, Garry; did the serpent eat the fruit he recommended?"</p>

<p>"He was too wise, not being acclimated in Eden."</p>

<p>She turned in her saddle, laughing, and sat looking down at him&mdash;then,
more gravely, at her ungloved hand which he still retained in
both of his.</p>

<p>Silence fell, and found them ready for it.</p>

<p>For a long while they said nothing; she slipped one leg over
the pommel and sat sideways, elbow on knee, chin propped in her
gloved hand. At times her eyes wandered over the sunny clearing,
but always reverted to him where he stood leaning against her
stirrup and looking up at her as though he never could look enough.</p>

<p>The faint, fresh perfume of China-berry was in the air, delicately
persistent amid the heavy odours from tufts of orange flowers
clinging to worn-out trees of the abandoned grove.</p>

<p>"Your own fragrance," he said.</p>

<p>She looked down at him, dreamily. He bent and touched with his
face the hand he held imprisoned.</p>

<p>"There was once," he said, "among the immortals a maid, Calypso....
Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said slowly. "I have not forgotten my only title to
immortality."</p>

<p>Their gaze met; then he stepped closer.</p>

<p>She raised both arms, crossing them to cover her eyes; his arms
circled her, lifted her from the saddle, holding her a moment
above the earth, free, glorious, superb in her vivid beauty; then
he swung her to the ground, holding her embraced; and as she abandoned
to him, one by one, her hands and mouth and throat, her gaze never
left him&mdash;clear, unfaltering eyes of a child innocent enough to
look on passion unafraid&mdash;fearless, confident eyes, wondering,
worshipping in unison with the deepening adoration in his.</p>

<p>"I love you so," she said, "I love you so for making me what
I am. I can be all that you could wish for if you only say it&mdash;"</p>

<p>She smiled, unconvinced at his tender protest, wise, sweet eyes
on his.</p>

<p>"What a boy you are, sometimes!&mdash;as though I did not know myself!
Dear, it is for you to say what I shall be. I am capable of being
what you think I am. Don't you know it, Garry? It is only&mdash;"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "And locked in his embrace, she lifted her lips
to his."]</p>

<p>She felt a cool, thin pressure on her finger, and glanced down
at the ring sparkling white fire. She lifted her hand, doubling
it; looked at the gem for a moment, laid it against her mouth.
Then, with dimmed eyes:</p>

<p>"Your love, your name, your ring for this nameless girl? And
<em>I&mdash;</em>what can I give for a bridal gift?"</p>

<p>"What sweet nonsense&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What can I give, Garry? Don't laugh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Calypso, dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;Calypso's offer!&mdash;immortal love&mdash;endless, deathless.
It is all I have to give you, Garry.... Will you take it?... Take
it, then."</p>

<p>And, locked in his embrace, she lifted her lips to his.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>
