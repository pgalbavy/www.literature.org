<p>While these lively scenes were taking place, Warren Starr was
not idle. The report of his gun was plainly heard by the other
Sioux and the captive, but the former took it for granted that
it was fired by their comrade, and calmly awaited his return with
the news of the death of the fugitive.</p>

<p>But as the reader has learned the boot was on the other leg.
The youth was unharmed, and his enemy was of no further account.</p>

<p>Actuated by the chivalrous wish to help Tim, he began cautiously
picking his way along the slope, at a considerable distance from
the base, peering forward and listening intently for sights and
sounds that could tell him how his companion had fared.</p>

<p>He had better fortune than he dared expect. The flickering of
something among the trees warned him that he was in a delicate
position, and his farther advance was with the utmost care, accompanied
by glances on every hand, to guard against walking into a trap.</p>

<p>Very soon he reached a point from which he saw all that was going
on. Tim was standing defiantly among the Sioux, who appeared to
be discussing the question of what to do with him. He identified
Starcus, and recognized also the hapless state of affairs.</p>

<p>Much as he regretted the conclusion, Warren Starr was forced,
in spite of himself, to see that it was out of his power to raise
a finger to help his friend. For one moment he meditated bringing
his Winchester to his shoulder and opening fire, but at the best
he could not hope to bring down more than two or three before
the others would be upon him. With no possible way of escape open,
the situation of Tim would be worse than before, for one of the
first things done by the Sioux would be to slay him on the spot,
whereas they were now likely to spare him for a time, and so long
as he had life, so long did hope remain.</p>

<p>Warren would have been as eager to befriend the brave fellow
as the latter would have been to aid him; but, as we have said,
there was no dodging the fact that it was out of his power. What,
therefore, should he do for himself and the other loved ones for
whom all this danger had been incurred?</p>

<p>Where were that father, mother, and little sister? They might
be in equally sore distress, and longer delay on his part perhaps
would decide the question of life or death.</p>

<p>Stealthily withdrawing again, until well beyond sight of the
group, he began carefully descending the side of the ridge toward
the open prairie. In doing so, he avoided doubling on his own
trail, for at any moment some of the Sioux were liable to start
out on a tour of investigation, which would bring them face to
face with him.</p>

<p>With all his senses on the alert, he threaded his way among the
trees and around the rocks and bowlders, until he stood on the
base of the elevation, with the broad plain, across which he and
his friend had fled in such desperate haste, stretching out before
him for many miles.</p>

<p>But another sight interested him. Along the foot of the ridge
were scattered nearly a dozen Indian ponies, cropping as best
they could the grass, whose tops faintly showed above the thin
coating of snow. Their owners had abandoned them in their haste,
without thought of securing them to any of the limbs, confident
that they would be found within reach when wanted.</p>

<p>They were tough little animals, without saddle or bridle. The
majority had a blanket roughly secured over the back, with a thong
about the upper part of the neck, which was all that was needed
to guide them wherever their masters willed.</p>

<p>But there was one animal worth all the rest for whom the eyes
of the youth eagerly searched among the group, scattered at varying
distances. He would have given anything for a sight of his own
Jack at that moment.</p>

<p>To his astonishment, he saw nothing of him. Through some unaccountable
cause, he had vanished as utterly as if he had never existed.</p>

<p>In the vain hope of discovering him, Warren glanced from one
to the other, until he had surveyed each one several times over.
But there was no mistake; Jack was invisible.</p>

<p>The fact caused him keen regret, but it would not do to tarry,
with the certainty that the Sioux would soon learn the truth and
be after him like a whirlwind. One or two of their ponies were
almost as fleet as Jack, and Warren was a good enough horseman
to ride them as well as their masters could without saddle.</p>

<p>Fixing his attention on the best looking animal, which happened
also to be the nearest, he moved briskly toward him, with the
purpose of bounding upon his back and dashing away; but his abruptness
defeated his intention. It frightened the pony, who with a snort
threw up his head, trotted several rods out on the prairie, and
then turned and looked at him.</p>

<p>The alarm of this animal communicated itself to the others, who
also hurriedly trotted beyond his reach.</p>

<p>The situation was critical. The action of the ponies was almost
certain to be heard by their owners a short distance off, and
they would be quickly on the spot. If they caught sight of the
youth on foot trying to steal one, his position would be far more
hopeless than when among the rocks and trees.</p>

<p>Seeing his mistake, Warren tried to right matters by a less abrupt
approach. He dropped to a slow walk, holding out his hand and
uttering soothing words. Had he done this at the beginning, he
would have had no trouble in capturing any horse he desired, but
the animals identified him as a stranger, and continued shy.</p>

<p>The finest, which he had sought first to catch, closely watched
him as he slowly approached, but at the very moment the heart
of the youth was beating high with hope, he swung his head around
and trotted beyond reach. Warren turned his attention to the one
that was nearest, and by a sudden dash aimed to catch his halter,
one end of which was dangling in the snow.</p>

<p>As he stooped to grasp the thong, it was whisked from under his
hand, and the pony galloped beyond his reach.</p>

<p>The bitter disappointment made Warren desperate. He had undertaken
an impossible task. He might succeed had more time been at his
command, but the Sioux were liable to appear any minute. It would
not do for him to be caught in this situation. He must abandon
the attempt and get back among the trees and rocks, where there
remained the bare possibility of eluding the red men.</p>

<p>"What the mischief has become of Jack?" he muttered, facing about
and breaking into a lope for the ridge. "If he were only in sight,
he would come to me at once. Hello! just what I feared!"</p>

<p>At that juncture he detected something moving among the trees.
It was not clearly seen, but not doubting that the Sioux were
coming, he broke into a run for cover, not daring to risk a shot
until partial shelter was secured.</p>

<p>In his affright he did not dare glance to the left even, and
held his breath in thrilling expectancy, certain that with every
leap he took he would be greeted by a volley, or that the Sioux
would throw themselves across his track to shut off all chance
of escape.</p>

<p>That they did not do so was not only unaccountable to him, but
gave him the hope that possibly he might still elude them. Bending
his head, he ran with might and main. The distance was not great,
but it seemed tenfold greater than it was, and a slip of the foot,
which came near bringing him to his knees, filled his heart with
despair and made him certain that he would soon join Tim Brophy.</p>

<p>He heard his pursuers at his heels. Despite his own fleetness,
they were outspeeding him. Nothing could save him from being overtaken
before reaching the ridge.</p>

<p>Suddenly a peculiarity in the sound made by those at his rear
caused him abruptly to halt and look around.</p>

<p>Then, to his unbounded delight and amazement, he recognized his
own pony, Jack, striving hard to keep him company.</p>
