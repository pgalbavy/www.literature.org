<p>The body of water referred to, which for certain reasons I shall
call Gosling Lake—though that is not its real name—is of irregular
form, about two miles long from east to west, and somewhat less
in breadth. It is surrounded by pines, balsams and firs, which
in most places grow quite close to the water’s edge, with here
and there a grassy stretch of moderate extent, bordering the lake.</p>

<p>On the southern shore stands the bungalow or clubhouse, to which
more than one reference has been made. It is a low, log structure
of one story with a piazza in front, is strong and secure and
has no pretensions to elegance or luxury. It was intended merely
to afford sleeping and dining quarters for the occupants. When
a party of wealthy men plunge into the wilderness for what they
call an outing, they make a great ado over "roughing" it. They
announce that they will sleep in the open, work strenuously for
their own meals, and live the simple life, as did the wood rangers
in the olden times. But the chances are ten to one that the campers
out will bring a professional cook and one or two other servants
with them, will sleep in the beds prepared by other hands, and
spend most of their time in luxurious idleness.</p>

<p>The bungalow which we have in mind is fifty feet in length and
is divided into two rooms,—the smaller for dining and social communion
on stormy afternoons and during the evenings. This room has an
old-fashioned fireplace and is provided with cooking utensils,
a large table, several chairs and other simple articles of furniture.
The larger apartment is furnished with rows of bunks along each
side, where spruce tips or pine boughs serve as mattresses upon
which pillows and blankets are spread. The floor is of smooth
planking, and without rugs. Large wooden pegs driven into the
walls take the place of closets. In short the aim is to yield
solid comfort, yet encourage the belief among the campers that
they are actually roughing it.</p>

<p>Drawn up on the grassy slope in front of the clubhouse were two
Indian canoes, each large enough to carry a half dozen full grown
persons. The single paddles required for propulsion were kept
within the building and the craft when not in use were turned
over with the bottoms facing the sky. Such is an imperfect glimpse
of the clubhouse that was to serve as headquarters of the Boy
Patrols during the last month of that summer.</p>

<p>One of the striking attractions of the rivers, lakes and streams
of Maine is their crystalline clearness. I have looked down at
the boulders and pebbles twenty feet and more below the surface,
where they were as clearly visible as if only the atmosphere was
between them and my eyes. Maine lies so far north that its waters
are generally cold and the bather who plunges into their depths
gasps and feels like scrambling out again; but let him persevere
for a brief while and the bath becomes invigorating and gives
the body a glow and reacting warmth that thrills with exquisite
pleasure.</p>

<p>At six o’clock on that memorable morning in early August, you
might have looked at the clubhouse and believed it did not contain
a living person or creature,—so quiet and free from stir was everything
connected with it; but a few minutes later, the broad door opened
and a young man walked a few steps toward the lake and then halted
and looked around, as if expecting some one. He had dark curly
hair, large clear eyes, black mustache, fair complexion somewhat
tanned, a lithe, active figure rather below the medium stature,
and an alert manner. His dress was such as is worn by the Boy
Scouts. On the upper part of his left sleeve was a badge in blue,
green and red, consisting mainly of an eagle with spread wings
and shield, and the motto "Be Prepared" in gilt metal. This is
the official insignia of the Scout Master, Scout Commissioner,
Assistant Scout Master and of the First Class Boy Scout.</p>

<p>The gentleman who thus stepped upon the stage of action was Bert
Hall, who, although a family man, is as much a boy as he was a
dozen years ago. In fact, he can never be anything else, though
in his activities no one is more mature than he. He is always
doing something for the benefit of others, so it was inevitable
that when the scout movement was originated it caught his attention
and engaged his sympathy and co-operation.</p>

<p>The Scout Master’s second glance at the door showed mild surprise.
He drew out his watch and then smiled, for he saw he was a few
minutes ahead of time.</p>

<p>"I have tried to teach the boys that it is better to be too early
than too late, but better than either to hit the nail exactly
on the head."</p>

<p>He kept his eye on the face of the watch until the minute and
hour hand formed a straight line from the figure <em>XII </em>to
<em>VI. </em>Then he slipped it back in his pocket.</p>

<p>Almost in the same instant, the door was drawn inward, and with
a shout, a Boy Scout, his face aglow with eager expectancy, dashed
down the slope like a deer, ran a few paces into the lake, splashing
the water high, closed the palms of his hand above his head and
dived out of sight. He was Charley Chase, the Blazing Arrow Patrol
leader. Right behind him on a dead run, came Corporal George Robe,
followed by Scouts Kenneth Henke, Kenneth Mitchell, Robert Snow,
Ernest Oberlander, Colgate Craig, Robert Rice, Hubert Wood and
Harold Hopkins.</p>

<p>After a brief wait, other members of the troop streamed laughing
after the leaders, among them being our old friends Alvin Landon
and Chester Haynes. The clothing of each consisted of a pair of
tights, whose length from the extreme northern boundary to the
remote southern edge, was perhaps twelve inches. It was a proper
concession to the aesthetic demands of the occasion.</p>

<p>How they frolicked and disported themselves! A party of boys
can no more keep from shouting than so many girls can refrain
from screaming at sight of a mouse whisking about their feet.
They dived, swam, splashed one another, darted under the surface
like so many young submarines, and reveled in the very ecstasy
of enjoyment. The first thrilling sting of the cold element caused
all to gasp, but a few minutes ended that and none would have
had it a degree milder.</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall moved a little to one side, so as to be out
of the way, stepped close to the water, folded his arms and smiled
in sympathy at sight of the joyous abandon of boys,—one of whom
he had often been and meant to be again. His present duty was
to oversee his charges. He knew all were good swimmers, but some
one might be seized with cramp, because of the sudden plunge,
and accident always threatens everybody. A person can be drowned
with such awful suddenness that the Master never took any chances
that could be averted. He held himself ready to leap into the
lake on the instant his services were needed.</p>

<p>As the minutes passed, he felt how slight the danger was of anything
of that nature, but as has been said, he was ever on his guard.
He was watching Alvin Adams and Corporal Robe, who were engaged
in the rollicking sport of ducking each other. Suddenly Alvin
slipped below the surface, when his friend was not looking, seized
the corporal’s ankle, and yanked him under. The next instant,
Robe bobbed up, blew the water from his mouth in spray, glanced
around and seeing Alvin swimming desperately away, made after
him. Both were equally skilful in the water and it could not be
seen that the pursuer was gaining. Alvin might have escaped by
heading for shore or where the water was shallow, but that would
have been an admission of the superiority of the other, and no
healthy youngster will do <em>that</em> until it is fairly demonstrated
and even then will hesitate.</p>

<p>Suddenly Alvin dropped out of sight. It looked as if he did so
to escape his pursuer who stopped over the spot where he had gone
down, ready to seize him the instant he came within reach. Scout
Master Hall laughed and watched the fun.</p>

<p>Up shot the head of Alvin a little way off, and Robe was about
to make after him, when the youth called out:</p>

<p>"I’ve got a cramp!" and down he went.</p>

<p>Hall gathered himself for the run and jump, when with one foot
in the water, he saw the necessity had passed. In a few seconds,
Alvin’s head showed again, but the corporal with one resolute
stroke was beside him.</p>

<p>"All right, old fellow; put your hand on my shoulder," he said.</p>

<p>Despite his predicament, Alvin was cool and did as directed.
As he rested his left hand on the shoulder of his friend, he said
with a laugh:</p>

<p>"Gee! but my legs seemed to be tied up in knots; that’s the first
time I ever was caught; thanks; I’m all right, with your help."</p>

<p>Chester and several other boys had hastened to his help, but
they saw all danger was over. Robe swam with moderate stroke toward
shore. The water quickly shallowed, and when his feet touched
the hard bottom, Alvin tried awkwardly to walk, but he had to
have support before he could stumble to land, where he sank down
and began vigorously working his legs, while Robe and the Scout
Master massaged the corded muscles.</p>

<p>"The next time you go in bathing, try the Indian preventive of
cramps," said Hall.</p>

<p>"What’s that? I used to wear an eelskin tied about one of my
ankles."</p>

<p>"No good. Before entering the water, rub the pit of your stomach
hard with the dry palms of your hands. When the skin grows red,
dash cold water over the stomach and rub dry; after that you need
have no fear of cramps. You seem to be all right."</p>

<p>"I am; I should like to try it again; I owe the corporal the
biggest ducking he ever had."</p>

<p>"No; you have had enough swimming for this morning, and so have
all the boys."</p>

<p>The Scout Master gave the signal and the whole party obediently
came ashore, ran into the building and hurriedly donned their
clothing.</p>

<p>The next thing in order was breakfast and you may be sure every
lad was ready for it. Although the old-fashioned implements in
the clubhouse would have served well, yet with the score of sharp
appetites to satisfy, the delay would have been trying. Moreover,
the Scout Master wished to drill the youngsters in preparing their
meals, as if they were on a hike through a long stretch of wilderness.
So the three Patrols set to work under his eye, doing so with
a system and intelligence that called for slight suggestion from
him.</p>

<p>"Remember," he cautioned; "<em>you</em> must use no more than
two matches in starting a fire and a single one ought to answer."</p>

<p>The team with supplies had arrived from Boothbay Harbor the day
before, so there was no lack of food. The first step was to build
a fireplace or primitive stove. This was done by rolling three
or four large stones in position near one another. Into the open
space between them were arranged some dry shavings from a dead
limb of cedar, including leaves, twigs, pine cones and pieces
of heavier wood,—all set so loosely that there was plenty of room
for draught. Then a Vulcan match, carefully shielded from the
slightest breath of wind, was applied to the feathery stuff at
the base of the pile. It caught at once, climbed over and through
the more solid wood, and in a few minutes a vigorous, crackling
blaze was going. Resting on top of the irregular stones—which
gave many openings for the flames to circulate through—the big
round griddle was placed in position. As it caught the heat, the
smooth surface was smeared with a piece of salt pork, and then
the batter of self-raising flour was poured out. Almost immediately
the upper side of the mixture broke into numerous little holes
or openings, proving that the hot iron was doing its work. The
cook slid his round flat turner under the circle of batter, flopped
it over, revealing the rich golden brown of what had been the
lower side. Two griddles were kept going until it seemed the pancakes
were beyond counting. When after a long, long while a sufficient
number had been prepared, thin slices of bacon were fried on the
griddle and in the surplus fat, shavings of raw potatoes were
done to a turn.</p>

<p>I am sure you need no instruction in the most modern methods
of making griddle cakes, frying bacon, preparing canned salmon
or trout, roasting potatoes, baking fresh fish, grilling frogs’
legs, the different ways of cooking eggs, and making coffee, cocoa
and tea. If you feel you need training in those fields of industry,
apply to your mothers or big sisters and they will teach you far
better than I can. I advise campers out, however, not to try to
bake biscuits or bread. The results are not satisfactory and it’s
easier to carry it.</p>

<p>The most destructive scourge to which all wooded sections of
our country are exposed is that of forest fires. The last report
of the Forestry Commission is that the loss in one year has amounted
to five million dollars. A vast amount of property is thus annually
destroyed, and the lamentable fact remains that in many instances
the conflagrations are due to carelessness. A party of campers
go into the woods, start a fire for cooking purposes and leave
the embers smouldering, thinking they will die out in a little
while and cause no harm. These embers, however, may stay alive
for days, be fanned into a blaze by a gust of wind, and, scattering
among the dry leaves and withered foliage, swell into a varying
mass of flame which sweeps everything before it.</p>

<p>Many states thus exposed employ fire rangers who use incessant
vigilance in saving their forests. Notices are posted throughout
the Maine woods warning all against this peril. A few years ago,
Congress passed a law imposing a fine of five thousand dollars
or imprisonment for two years or both as a penalty for maliciously
firing any tract, and a lesser punishment for causing a fire through
carelessness.</p>

<p>When the morning meal was over, the Boy Patrols promptly extinguished
every ember by pouring water over it until not a spark remained.
Then the dishes were washed, dried and piled away on the shelves
in the clubhouse; the bedding was aired and fuel gathered for
the midday meal. By that time the sun was well up in the sky.
Scout Master Hall put the troop through a brisk military drill,
and then asked them to express their wishes.</p>

<p>The propositions offered almost equaled the number of boys. Some
wished to paddle around the lake in the two canoes. True, most
of them knew little about the management of such craft, but every
one was sure he could quickly learn.</p>

<p>"All you have to do is to sit still and swing the paddle first
on one side and then on the other," was the self-complacent assertion
of Kenneth Henke.</p>

<p>"That may be so," assented the Scout Master, "but there is a
right and a wrong way of doing everything, and, as a rule, a boy
can be depended upon to begin with the wrong way. You never saw
a quadruped which when thrown into the water will not swim on
the first trial, as well as if he had spent months in training,
but whoever heard of a man or boy who did it?"</p>

<p>"I have," was the surprising reply of Alvin Landon.</p>

<p>In answer to the inquiring looks of the party, Alvin said:</p>

<p>"Chester and I have a friend, an Irish boy about our age, named
Mike Murphy, that we expected would meet us here, who had never
been able to swim a stroke. We have watched him try it many times,
but he always failed. One day when he was asleep he was pitched
overboard where the water must have been twenty feet deep, and
straightway he swam like a duck to land."</p>

<p>"I have heard of such instances, but they are exceedingly rare.
It was not the case with me and I think with none of you."</p>

<p>There was a general shaking of heads. Then a proposal was made
to fish along shore, or to break up into small parties and ramble
through the woods, studying the different species of trees and
plant life, birds, and possibly some small animals, trailing,
and what may be called the finer points of woodcraft.</p>

<p>It was Chester Haynes who struck fire by shouting:</p>

<p>"Let’s have a game of baseball!"</p>

<p>"That’s it! hurrah!" and a dozen hats were flung in air; "there’s
more than enough of us to make two nines and all know the game."</p>

<p>"A good idea," said Scout Master Hall, who could not forget that
it was only a few years before that he won fame as one of the
best batters and short-stops on the team of his native town.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of the boys was not dampened by the discovery
of several facts which, in ordinary circumstances, would have
been discouraging. In the first place, there was only one ball
in the whole company. Not only were there grave doubts about its
being of the regulation make, but the seams had been started,
and it looked as if the cover would be quickly knocked off. No
use, however, of crossing a bridge till you reach it.</p>

<p>That no one had brought a bat mattered not. It was easy with
the sharp hatchets to cut and trim a limb to the proper size,
or near enough for practical purposes. When Bobby Rice, with many
suggestions from the others, had completed his task, all agreed
that it was an artistic piece of work, and might well serve as
a model for the regular outfitters.</p>

<p>No one referred to the lack of gloves and chest protectors, for
only mollycoddles would mind a little thing like that. The German
students at Heidelberg are proud of the scars they win in duels,
and any reputable ball player is equally pleased with his corkscrew
fingers and battered face.</p>

<p>But one obstacle for a time looked unsurmountable: where were
suitable grounds to be found?</p>

<p>The grassy slope which borders Gosling Lake is comparatively
narrow, though of varying width. Of necessity the players would
have to restrain their ardor when it came to batting balls. If
these were driven too far to one side they would drop into the
water, the fielders would have to swim after them and home runs
would be overwhelming. If batted in the other direction they would
disappear among the trees and undergrowth, and what player can
send the ball in a straight line in front of the plate?</p>

<p>A hurried search brought to light a tract which it was decided
would do better than had been expected. The slope was perhaps
fifty feet wide in the broadest part, while lengthwise it extended
mostly round the lake. In this place the diamond was laid out.
A big flat stone served for home plate. Scout Master Hall paced
off the right distance to first base, where another stone was
laid. Second base was in the wavelet which lapped the beach, with
third base opposite first. If a runner should slide for it, the
chances were that he would keep on sliding into the lake, and
he would care very little if he did. It may be said that the alleged
diamond, while substantially of the right length, was very narrow
and shut in on one side by water and on the other by forest.</p>

<p>Bobby Snow captained one nine and Harold Hopkins the other. As
the batting order was arranged, Alvin Landon was to lead off for
his side, which was the first to go to the bat. Bobby was proud
of his skill as a pitcher. There is a legend that on one occasion
when pitching for his school nine, he struck three men and was
hit for nine bases and a home run in one inning. He indignantly
denies the charge when it is made, and I don’t believe it myself.
Be that as it may, there can be no criticism of his style when
he sends them over. His pose is impressive and leads the spectators
to expect great things.</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall generally acted as umpire. Every one knew he
was fair in his decisions and if he hadn’t been nobody dare say
anything. It wouldn’t pay.</p>

<p>All being ready, Alvin stepped to the plate, with his bat firmly
grasped. He spat on his hands, rubbed them up and down the rough
surface, tapped the stone home plate, spread his feet apart and
waited while every eye was fixed upon him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bobby Snow, the pitcher, wound himself up. Standing
erect to the towering height of nearly five feet, he swung his
left foot around in front of his right, with the toe resting on
the ground, and clasped the ball in his two palms which were held
as high above his head as he could reach. He and the batter grinned
at each other.</p>

<p>"I dare you to give me a good ball," said Alvin tantalizingly.</p>

<p>"Do you want an outcurve or incurve or dip or a spit ball?"</p>

<p>"I didn’t know you had ever heard of those things; do your worst."</p>

<p>Bobby with the sphere still held aloft, gravely looked around
at his out-fielders. The three almost touched elbows.</p>

<p>"Ty Cobb," he shouted, "move further to the left."</p>

<p>"I can’t do it," was the mutinous reply, "without going out into
the lake."</p>

<p>"Well, go there then."</p>

<p>"I’ll see you hanged first; you do it."</p>

<p>"Don’t get sassy; I’m not one of the spectators. Hans Wagner,
shift to the right."</p>

<p>"If I do," said the other fielder, "I’ll have to get behind a
tree."</p>

<p>"You’ll be of as much use there as where you are."</p>

<p>"Go ahead and pitch the ball, if you know how to do such a thing."</p>

<p>Bobby pretended not to hear this slur, but drawing back his right
arm, hurled the ball toward the plate. It was wide, but Alvin
struck at it, missing by about three feet. It went past the catcher
as he clawed at it and he had to hunt several minutes before finding
the elusive object, which he tossed back to Bobby, who without
any more remarks shot it forward and Alvin swung at it. He hit
it fairly too, though harder than he intended. It rose some fifty
feet and flitted like a flash among the trees. Alvin hurled his
bat aside, narrowly missing the umpire, and ran for first base.
Arrived there, he glared around.</p>

<p>"Where’s second base?" he called; "Ty Cobb, you moved it!"</p>

<p>"It got in the way of my feet; I flung it into the lake."</p>

<p>"That’s what I call dirty ball," commented Alvin, making a dive
ahead and arriving by a roundabout route at the home plate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the ball remained missing. One player after another
plunged into the woods and joined in the search. Finally the umpire
followed and then all the other players took a hand. You know
how contrary inanimate things—as for instance a collar button—can
be. That ball to this day has not been found, and the declaration
of the umpire was justified:</p>

<p>"The shortest game of baseball on record; two balls pitched,
one swipe and that’s all." </p>
