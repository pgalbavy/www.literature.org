<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>We say, “Marriage is a lottery”; also “Marriages are made in
Heaven”--but this is not so widely accepted as the other.
</p>
<p>We have a well-founded theory that it is best to marry “in one’s class,”
 and certain well-grounded suspicions of international marriages, which
seem to persist in the interests of social progress, rather than in
those of the contracting parties.
</p><p>But no combination of alien races, of color, of caste, or creed, was
ever so basically difficult to establish as that between us, three
modern American men, and these three women of Herland.
</p><p>It is all very well to say that we should have been frank about it
beforehand. We had been frank. We had discussed--at least Ellador and
I had--the conditions of The Great Adventure, and thought the path
was clear before us. But there are some things one takes for granted,
supposes are mutually understood, and to which both parties may
repeatedly refer without ever meaning the same thing.
</p><p>The differences in the education of the average man and woman are
great enough, but the trouble they make is not mostly for the man; he
generally carries out his own views of the case. The woman may have
imagined the conditions of married life to be different; but what she
imagined, was ignorant of, or might have preferred, did not seriously
matter.
</p><p>I can see clearly and speak calmly about this now, writing after a lapse
of years, years full of growth and education, but at the time it was
rather hard sledding for all of us--especially for Terry. Poor Terry!
You see, in any other imaginable marriage among the peoples of the
earth, whether the woman were black, red, yellow, brown, or white;
whether she were ignorant or educated, submissive or rebellious, she
would have behind her the marriage tradition of our general history.
This tradition relates the woman to the man. He goes on with his
business, and she adapts herself to him and to it. Even in citizenship,
by some strange hocus-pocus, that fact of birth and geography was waved
aside, and the woman automatically acquired the nationality of her
husband.
</p><p>Well--here were we, three aliens in this land of women. It was small in
area, and the external differences were not so great as to astound us.
We did not yet appreciate the differences between the race-mind of this
people and ours.
</p><p>In the first place, they were a “pure stock” of two thousand
uninterrupted years. Where we have some long connected lines of
thought and feeling, together with a wide range of differences, often
irreconcilable, these people were smoothly and firmly agreed on most of
the basic principles of their life; and not only agreed in principle,
but accustomed for these sixty-odd generations to act on those
principles.
</p><p>This is one thing which we did not understand--had made no allowance
for. When in our pre-marital discussions one of those dear girls had
said: “We understand it thus and thus,” or “We hold such and such to be
true,” we men, in our own deep-seated convictions of the power of love,
and our easy views about beliefs and principles, fondly imagined that
we could convince them otherwise. What we imagined, before marriage, did
not matter any more than what an average innocent young girl imagines.
We found the facts to be different.
</p><p>It was not that they did not love us; they did, deeply and warmly. But
there are you again--what they meant by “love” and what we meant by
“love” were so different.
</p><p>Perhaps it seems rather cold-blooded to say “we” and “they,” as if we
were not separate couples, with our separate joys and sorrows, but our
positions as aliens drove us together constantly. The whole strange
experience had made our friendship more close and intimate than it would
ever have become in a free and easy lifetime among our own people.
Also, as men, with our masculine tradition of far more than two thousand
years, we were a unit, small but firm, against this far larger unit of
feminine tradition.
</p><p>I think I can make clear the points of difference without a too painful
explicitness. The more external disagreement was in the matter of “the
home,” and the housekeeping duties and pleasures we, by instinct and
long education, supposed to be inherently appropriate to women.
</p><p>I will give two illustrations, one away up, and the other away down, to
show how completely disappointed we were in this regard.
</p><p>For the lower one, try to imagine a male ant, coming from some state of
existence where ants live in pairs, endeavoring to set up housekeeping
with a female ant from a highly developed anthill. This female ant might
regard him with intense personal affection, but her ideas of parentage
and economic management would be on a very different scale from his.
Now, of course, if she was a stray female in a country of pairing ants,
he might have had his way with her; but if he was a stray male in an
anthill--!
</p><p>For the higher one, try to imagine a devoted and impassioned man trying
to set up housekeeping with a lady angel, a real wings-and-harp-and-halo
angel, accustomed to fulfilling divine missions all over interstellar
space. This angel might love the man with an affection quite beyond his
power of return or even of appreciation, but her ideas of service and
duty would be on a very different scale from his. Of course, if she was
a stray angel in a country of men, he might have had his way with her;
but if he was a stray man among angels--!
</p><p>Terry, at his worst, in a black fury for which, as a man, I must have
some sympathy, preferred the ant simile. More of Terry and his special
troubles later. It was hard on Terry.
</p><p>Jeff--well, Jeff always had a streak that was too good for this world!
He’s the kind that would have made a saintly priest in parentagearlier
times. He accepted the angel theory, swallowed it whole, tried to force
it on us--with varying effect. He so worshipped Celis, and not only
Celis, but what she represented; he had become so deeply convinced of
the almost supernatural advantages of this country and people, that he
took his medicine like a--I cannot say “like a man,” but more as if he
wasn’t one.
</p><p>Don’t misunderstand me for a moment. Dear old Jeff was no milksop or
molly-coddle either. He was a strong, brave, efficient man, and an
excellent fighter when fighting was necessary. But there was always this
angel streak in him. It was rather a wonder, Terry being so different,
that he really loved Jeff as he did; but it happens so sometimes, in
spite of the difference--perhaps because of it.
</p><p>As for me, I stood between. I was no such gay Lothario as Terry, and no
such Galahad as Jeff. But for all my limitations I think I had the habit
of using my brains in regard to behavior rather more frequently than
either of them. I had to use brain-power now, I can tell you.
</p><p>The big point at issue between us and our wives was, as may easily be
imagined, in the very nature of the relation.
</p><p>“Wives! Don’t talk to me about wives!” stormed Terry. “They don’t know
what the word means.”
</p><p>Which is exactly the fact--they didn’t. How could they? Back in their
prehistoric records of polygamy and slavery there were no ideals of
wifehood as we know it, and since then no possibility of forming such.
</p><p>“The only thing they can think of about a man is FATHERHOOD!” said Terry
in high scorn. “FATHERHOOD! As if a man was always wanting to be a
<strong>FATHER!”</strong>
</p><p>This also was correct. They had their long, wide, deep, rich experience
of Motherhood, and their only perception of the value of a male creature
as such was for Fatherhood.
</p><p>Aside from that, of course, was the whole range of personal love, love
which as Jeff earnestly phrased it “passeth the love of women!” It did,
too. I can give no idea--either now, after long and happy experience of
it, or as it seemed then, in the first measureless wonder--of the beauty
and power of the love they gave us.
</p><p>Even Alima--who had a more stormy temperament than either of the others,
and who, heaven knows, had far more provocation--even Alima was patience
and tenderness and wisdom personified to the man she loved, until
he--but I haven’t got to that yet.
</p>
<p>These, as Terry put it, “alleged or so-called wives” of ours, went right
on with their profession as foresters. We, having no special learnings,
had long since qualified as assistants. We had to do something, if only
to pass the time, and it had to be work--we couldn’t be playing forever.
</p><p>This kept us out of doors with those dear girls, and more or less
together--too much together sometimes.
</p><p>These people had, it now became clear to us, the highest, keenest, most
delicate sense of personal privacy, but not the faintest idea of that
SOLITUDE A DEUX we are so fond of. They had, every one of them, the “two
rooms and a bath” theory realized. From earliest childhood each had
a separate bedroom with toilet conveniences, and one of the marks of
coming of age was the addition of an outer room in which to receive
friends.
</p><p>Long since we had been given our own two rooms apiece, and as being of a
different sex and race, these were in a separate house. It seemed to be
recognized that we should breathe easier if able to free our minds in
real seclusion.
</p><p>For food we either went to any convenient eating-house, ordered a meal
brought in, or took it with us to the woods, always and equally good.
All this we had become used to and enjoyed--in our courting days.
</p><p>After marriage there arose in us a somewhat unexpected urge of feeling
that called for a separate house; but this feeling found no response in
the hearts of those fair ladies.
</p><p>“We ARE alone, dear,” Ellador explained to me with gentle patience.
“We are alone in these great forests; we may go and eat in any little
summer-house--just we two, or have a separate table anywhere--or even
have a separate meal in our own rooms. How could we be aloner?”
</p><p>This was all very true. We had our pleasant mutual solitude about our
work, and our pleasant evening talks in their apartments or ours; we
had, as it were, all the pleasures of courtship carried right on; but we
had no sense of--perhaps it may be called possession.
</p><p>“Might as well not be married at all,” growled Terry. “They only got up
that ceremony to please us--please Jeff, mostly. They’ve no real idea of
being married.”
</p><p>I tried my best to get Ellador’s point of view, and naturally I tried to
give her mine. Of course, what we, as men, wanted to make them see was
that there were other, and as we proudly said “higher,” uses in this
relation than what Terry called “mere parentage.” In the highest terms I
knew I tried to explain this to Ellador.
</p><p>“Anything higher than for mutual love to hope to give life, as we did?”
 she said. “How is it higher?”
</p><p>“It develops love,” I explained. “All the power of beautiful permanent
mated love comes through this higher development.”
</p><p>“Are you sure?” she asked gently. “How do you know that it was so
developed? There are some birds who love each other so that they mope
and pine if separated, and never pair again if one dies, but they never
mate except in the mating season. Among your people do you find high and
lasting affection appearing in proportion to this indulgence?”
</p><p>It is a very awkward thing, sometimes, to have a logical mind.
</p><p>Of course I knew about those monogamous birds and beasts too, that mate
for life and show every sign of mutual affection, without ever having
stretched the sex relationship beyond its original range. But what of
it?
</p><p>“Those are lower forms of life!” I protested. “They have no capacity
for faithful and affectionate, and apparently happy--but oh, my dear! my
dear!--what can they know of such a love as draws us together? Why, to
touch you--to be near you--to come closer and closer--to lose myself in
you--surely you feel it too, do you not?”
</p><p>I came nearer. I seized her hands.
</p><p>Her eyes were on mine, tender radiant, but steady and strong. There was
something so powerful, so large and changeless, in those eyes that
I could not sweep her off her feet by my own emotion as I had
unconsciously assumed would be the case.
</p><p>It made me feel as, one might imagine, a man might feel who loved a
goddess--not a Venus, though! She did not resent my attitude, did not
repel it, did not in the least fear it, evidently. There was not a shade
of that timid withdrawal or pretty resistance which are so--provocative.
</p><p>“You see, dearest,” she said, “you have to be patient with us. We are
not like the women of your country. We are Mothers, and we are People,
but we have not specialized in this line.”
</p><p>“We” and “we” and “we”--it was so hard to get her to be personal. And,
as I thought that, I suddenly remembered how we were always criticizing
OUR women for BEING so personal.
</p><p>Then I did my earnest best to picture to her the sweet intense joy of
married lovers, and the result in higher stimulus to all creative work.
</p><p>“Do you mean,” she asked quite calmly, as if I was not holding her cool
firm hands in my hot and rather quivering ones, “that with you, when
people marry, they go right on doing this in season and out of season,
with no thought of children at all?”
</p><p>“They do,” I said, with some bitterness. “They are not mere parents.
They are men and women, and they love each other.”
</p><p>“How long?” asked Ellador, rather unexpectedly.
</p><p>“How long?” I repeated, a little dashed. “Why as long as they live.”
</p><p>“There is something very beautiful in the idea,” she admitted, still as
if she were discussing life on Mars. “This climactic expression, which,
in all the other life-forms, has but the one purpose, has with you
become specialized to higher, purer, nobler uses. It has--I judge from
what you tell me--the most ennobling effect on character. People marry,
not only for parentage, but for this exquisite interchange--and, as
a result, you have a world full of continuous lovers, ardent, happy,
mutually devoted, always living on that high tide of supreme emotion
which we had supposed to belong only to one season and one use. And you
say it has other results, stimulating all high creative work. That must
mean floods, oceans of such work, blossoming from this intense happiness
of every married pair! It is a beautiful idea!”
</p><p>She was silent, thinking.
</p><p>So was I.
</p><p>She slipped one hand free, and was stroking my hair with it in a gentle
motherly way. I bowed my hot head on her shoulder and felt a dim sense
of peace, a restfulness which was very pleasant.
</p><p>“You must take me there someday, darling,” she was saying. “It is
not only that I love you so much, I want to see your country--your
people--your mother--” she paused reverently. “Oh, how I shall love your
mother!”
</p><p>I had not been in love many times--my experience did not compare
with Terry’s. But such as I had was so different from this that I was
perplexed, and full of mixed feelings: partly a growing sense of common
ground between us, a pleasant rested calm feeling, which I had imagined
could only be attained in one way; and partly a bewildered resentment
because what I found was not what I had looked for.
</p><p>It was their confounded psychology! Here they were with this profound
highly developed system of education so bred into them that even if they
were not teachers by profession they all had a general proficiency in
it--it was second nature to them.
</p><p>And no child, stormily demanding a cookie “between meals,” was ever more
subtly diverted into an interest in house-building than was I when
I found an apparently imperative demand had disappeared without my
noticing it.
</p><p>And all the time those tender mother eyes, those keen scientific eyes,
noting every condition and circumstance, and learning how to “take time
by the forelock” and avoid discussion before occasion arose.
</p><p>I was amazed at the results. I found that much, very much, of what I had
honestly supposed to be a physiological necessity was a psychological
necessity--or so believed. I found, after my ideas of what was essential
had changed, that my feelings changed also. And more than all, I found
this--a factor of enormous weight--these women were not provocative.
That made an immense difference.
</p><p>The thing that Terry had so complained of when we first came--that they
weren’t “feminine,” they lacked “charm,” now became a great comfort.
Their vigorous beauty was an aesthetic pleasure, not an irritant. Their
dress and ornaments had not a touch of the “come-and-find-me” element.
</p><p>Even with my own Ellador, my wife, who had for a time unveiled a woman’s
heart and faced the strange new hope and joy of dual parentage, she
afterward withdrew again into the same good comrade she had been at
first. They were women, PLUS, and so much plus that when they did not
choose to let the womanness appear, you could not find it anywhere.
</p><p>I don’t say it was easy for me; it wasn’t. But when I made appeal to
her sympathies I came up against another immovable wall. She was sorry,
honestly sorry, for my distresses, and made all manner of thoughtful
suggestions, often quite useful, as well as the wise foresight I have
mentioned above, which often saved all difficulty before it arose; but
her sympathy did not alter her convictions.
</p><p>“If I thought it was really right and necessary, I could perhaps bring
myself to it, for your sake, dear; but I do not want to--not at all.
You would not have a mere submission, would you? That is not the kind of
high romantic love you spoke of, surely? It is a pity, of course, that
you should have to adjust your highly specialized faculties to our
unspecialized ones.”
</p><p>Confound it! I hadn’t married the nation, and I told her so. But she
only smiled at her own limitations and explained that she had to “think
in we’s.”
</p><p>Confound it again! Here I’d have all my energies focused on one wish,
and before I knew it she’d have them dissipated in one direction or
another, some subject of discussion that began just at the point I was
talking about and ended miles away.
</p><p>It must not be imagined that I was just repelled, ignored, left to
cherish a grievance. Not at all. My happiness was in the hands of a
larger, sweeter womanhood than I had ever imagined. Before our marriage
my own ardor had perhaps blinded me to much of this. I was madly in love
with not so much what was there as with what I supposed to be there. Now
I found an endlessly beautiful undiscovered country to explore, and in
it the sweetest wisdom and understanding. It was as if I had come to
some new place and people, with a desire to eat at all hours, and no
other interests in particular; and as if my hosts, instead of merely
saying, “You shall not eat,” had presently aroused in me a lively desire
for music, for pictures, for games, for exercise, for playing in the
water, for running some ingenious machine; and, in the multitude of my
satisfactions, I forgot the one point which was not satisfied, and got
along very well until mealtime.
</p><p>One of the cleverest and most ingenious of these tricks was only clear
to me many years after, when we were so wholly at one on this subject
that I could laugh at my own predicament then. It was this: You see,
with us, women are kept as different as possible and as feminine as
possible. We men have our own world, with only men in it; we get tired
of our ultra-maleness and turn gladly to the ultra-femaleness. Also,
in keeping our women as feminine as possible, we see to it that when
we turn to them we find the thing we want always in evidence. Well, the
atmosphere of this place was anything but seductive. The very numbers
of these human women, always in human relation, made them anything
but alluring. When, in spite of this, my hereditary instincts and
race-traditions made me long for the feminine response in Ellador,
instead of withdrawing so that I should want her more, she deliberately
gave me a little too much of her society.--always de-feminized, as it
were. It was awfully funny, really.
</p><p>Here was I, with an Ideal in mind, for which I hotly longed, and here
was she, deliberately obtruding in the foreground of my consciousness a
Fact--a fact which I coolly enjoyed, but which actually interfered with
what I wanted. I see now clearly enough why a certain kind of man, like
Sir Almroth Wright, resents the professional development of women. It
gets in the way of the sex ideal; it temporarily covers and excludes
femininity.
</p><p>Of course, in this case, I was so fond of Ellador my friend, of Ellador
my professional companion, that I necessarily enjoyed her society on any
terms. Only--when I had had her with me in her de-feminine capacity for
a sixteen-hour day, I could go to my own room and sleep without dreaming
about her.
</p><p>The witch! If ever anybody worked to woo and win and hold a human soul,
she did, great superwoman that she was. I couldn’t then half comprehend
the skill of it, the wonder. But this I soon began to find: that under
all our cultivated attitude of mind toward women, there is an older,
deeper, more “natural” feeling, the restful reverence which looks up to
the Mother sex.
</p><p>So we grew together in friendship and happiness, Ellador and I, and so
did Jeff and Celis.
</p><p>When it comes to Terry’s part of it, and Alima’s, I’m sorry--and
I’m ashamed. Of course I blame her somewhat. She wasn’t as fine
a psychologist as Ellador, and what’s more, I think she had a
far-descended atavistic trace of more marked femaleness, never apparent
till Terry called it out. But when all is said, it doesn’t excuse him. I
hadn’t realized to the full Terry’s character--I couldn’t, being a man.
</p><p>The position was the same as with us, of course, only with these
distinctions. Alima, a shade more alluring, and several shades less able
as a practical psychologist; Terry, a hundredfold more demanding--and
proportionately less reasonable.
</p><p>Things grew strained very soon between them. I fancy at first, when
they were together, in her great hope of parentage and his keen joy of
conquest--that Terry was inconsiderate. In fact, I know it, from things
he said.
</p><p>“You needn’t talk to me,” he snapped at Jeff one day, just before
our weddings. “There never was a woman yet that did not enjoy being
MASTERED. All your pretty talk doesn’t amount to a hill o’beans--I
KNOW.” And Terry would hum:
</p><p>    I’ve taken my fun where I found it.
    I’ve rogued and I’ve ranged in my time,
</p><p>and
</p><p>    The things that I learned from the yellow and black,
    They ‘ave helped me a ‘eap with the white.
</p><p>Jeff turned sharply and left him at the time. I was a bit disquieted
myself.
</p><p>Poor old Terry! The things he’d learned didn’t help him a heap in
Herland. His idea was to take--he thought that was the way. He thought,
he honestly believed, that women like it. Not the women of Herland! Not
Alima!
</p><p>I can see her now--one day in the very first week of their marriage,
setting forth to her day’s work with long determined strides and
hard-set mouth, and sticking close to Ellador. She didn’t wish to be
alone with Terry--you could see that.
</p><p>But the more she kept away from him, the more he wanted her--naturally.
</p><p>He made a tremendous row about their separate establishments, tried to
keep her in his rooms, tried to stay in hers. But there she drew the
line sharply.
</p><p>He came away one night, and stamped up and down the moonlit road,
swearing under his breath. I was taking a walk that night too, but I
wasn’t in his state of mind. To hear him rage you’d not have believed
that he loved Alima at all--you’d have thought that she was some quarry
he was pursuing, something to catch and conquer.
</p><p>I think that, owing to all those differences I spoke of, they soon lost
the common ground they had at first, and were unable to meet sanely
and dispassionately. I fancy too--this is pure conjecture--that he
had succeeded in driving Alima beyond her best judgment, her real
conscience, and that after that her own sense of shame, the reaction of
the thing, made her bitter perhaps.
</p><p>They quarreled, really quarreled, and after making it up once or twice,
they seemed to come to a real break--she would not be alone with him
at all. And perhaps she was a bit nervous, I don’t know, but she got
Moadine to come and stay next door to her. Also, she had a sturdy
assistant detailed to accompany her in her work.
</p><p>Terry had his own ideas, as I’ve tried to show. I daresay he thought he
had a right to do as he did. Perhaps he even convinced himself that
it would be better for her. Anyhow, he hid himself in her bedroom one
night...
</p><p>The women of Herland have no fear of men. Why should they have? They
are not timid in any sense. They are not weak; and they all have strong
trained athletic bodies. Othello could not have extinguished Alima with
a pillow, as if she were a mouse.
</p><p>Terry put in practice his pet conviction that a woman loves to be
mastered, and by sheer brute force, in all the pride and passion of his
intense masculinity, he tried to master this woman.
</p><p>It did not work. I got a pretty clear account of it later from Ellador,
but what we heard at the time was the noise of a tremendous struggle,
and Alima calling to Moadine. Moadine was close by and came at once; one
or two more strong grave women followed.
</p><p>Terry dashed about like a madman; he would cheerfully have killed
them--he told me that, himself--but he couldn’t. When he swung a chair
over his head one sprang in the air and caught it, two threw themselves
bodily upon him and forced him to the floor; it was only the work of a
few moments to have him tied hand and foot, and then, in sheer pity for
his futile rage, to anesthetize him.
</p><p>Alima was in a cold fury. She wanted him killed--actually.
</p><p>There was a trial before the local Over Mother, and this woman, who did
not enjoy being mastered, stated her case.
</p><p>In a court in our country he would have been held quite “within his
rights,” of course. But this was not our country; it was theirs. They
seemed to measure the enormity of the offense by its effect upon a
possible fatherhood, and he scorned even to reply to this way of putting
it.
</p><p>He did let himself go once, and explained in definite terms that they
were incapable of understanding a man’s needs, a man’s desires, a man’s
point of view. He called them neuters, epicenes, bloodless, sexless
creatures. He said they could of course kill him--as so many insects
could--but that he despised them nonetheless.
</p><p>And all those stern grave mothers did not seem to mind his despising
them, not in the least.
</p><p>It was a long trial, and many interesting points were brought out as to
their views of our habits, and after a while Terry had his sentence. He
waited, grim and defiant. The sentence was: “You must go home!”
