<P>
Wingrave had risen to his feet. He was perfectly calm, but there was a look on
his face which Juliet had never seen there before. Instinctively she drew a
little away, and Aynesworth took his place between them.
<P>
"Are you mad, Aynesworth?" Wingrave asked coolly.
<P>
"Not now," Aynesworth answered. "I have been mad to stay with you for four
years, to look on, however passively, at all the evil you have done. I've had
enough of it now, and of you! I came here to tell you so."
<P>
"A letter," Wingrave answered, "would have been equally efficacious. However,
since you have told me--"
<P>
"I'll go when I'm ready," Aynesworth answered, "and I've more to say. When I
first entered your service and you told me what your outlook upon life was, I
never dreamed but that the years would make a man of you again, I never
believed that you could be such a brute as to carry out your threats. I saw
you do your best to corrupt a poor, silly little woman, who only escaped ruin
by a miracle; I saw you deal out what might have been irretrievable disaster
to a young man just starting in life. Since your return to London, you have
done as little good, and as much harm, with your millions as any man could."
<P>
Wingrave was beginning to look bored.
<P>
"This is getting," he remarked, "a little like melodrama. I have no objection
to being abused, even in my own garden, but there are limits to my patience.
Come to the point, if you have one."
<P>
"Willingly," Aynesworth answered. "I want you to understand this. I have never
tried to interfere in any of your malicious schemes, although I am ashamed to
think I have watched them without protest. But this one is different. If you
have harmed, if you should ever dare to harm this child, as sure as there is a
God above us, I will kill you!"
<P>
"What is she to you?" Wingrave asked calmly.
<P>
"She--I love her," Aynesworth answered. "I mean her to be my wife."
<P>
"And she?"
<P>
"She looks upon me as her greatest friend, her natural protector, and protect
her I will--even against you."
<P>
Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"It seems to me," he said, "that the young lady is very well off as she is.
She has lived in my house, and been taken care of by my servants. She has been
relieved of all the material cares of life, and she has been her own mistress.
I scarcely see how you, my young friend, could do better for her."
<P>
Aynesworth moved a step nearer to him. The veins on his forehead were swollen.
His voice was hoarse with passion.
<P>
"Why have you done this for her?" he demanded, "secretly, too, you a man to
whom a good action is a matter for a sneer, who have deliberately proclaimed
yourself an evil-doer by choice and destiny? Why have you constituted yourself
her guardian? Not from kindness for you don't know what it is; not from good
nature for you haven't any. Why, then?"
<P>
Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"I admit." he remarked coolly, "that it does seem rather a problem; we all do
unaccountable things at times, though."
<P>
"For your own sake," Aynesworth said fiercely, "I trust that this is one of
the unaccountable things. For the rest, you shall have no other chance. I
shall take her to Truro tonight."
<P>
"Are you sure that she will go?"
<P>
"I shall tell her the truth."
<P>
"And if she does not believe you?"
<P>
"She will! If you interfere, I shall take her by force."
<P>
"I interfere!" Wingrave remarked. "You need not be afraid of that. The affair
as it stands is far too interesting. Call her, and make your appeal."
<P>
"I shall tell her the truth," Aynesworth declared.
<P>
"By all means! I shall remain and listen to my indictment. Quite a novel
sensation! Call the young lady, by all means, and don't spare me."
<P>
Aynesworth moved a few steps up the path. He called to her softly, and she
came through the little iron gates from the rose gardens. She was very pale,
and there was a gleam in her eyes which was like fear. Aynesworth took her by
the hand and led her forward.
<P>
"You must be brave, dear," he whispered. "I am compelled to say some
disagreeable things. It is for your good. It is because I care for you so
much."
<P>
She looked towards Wingrave. He was sitting upon the garden seat, and his face
was absolutely expressionless. He spoke to her, and his cold, precise tone
betrayed not the slightest sign of any emotion.
<P>
"Aynesworth," he remarked, "is going to tell you some interesting facts about
myself. Please listen attentively as afterwards you will be called upon to
make a somewhat important decision."
<P>
She looked at him a little wistfully and sighed. There was no trace any longer
of her companion of the last few weeks. It was the stern and gloomy stranger
of her earlier recollections who sat there with folded arms.
<P>
"Is it really necessary?" she asked.
<P>
"Absolutely," Aynesworth answered hurriedly. "It won't take long, but there
are things which you must know."
<P>
"Very well," she answered, "I am listening."
<P>
Aynesworth inclined his head towards the place where Wingrave sat.
<P>
"I will admit," he said, "that the man there, whom I have served for the last
four years and more, never deceived me as to his real character and
intentions. He had been badly treated by a woman, and he told me plainly that
he entered into life again at war with his fellows. Where he could see an
opportunity of doing evil, he meant to do it; where he could bring misery and
suffering upon anyone with whom he came into contact, he meant to grasp the
opportunity. I listened to him, but I never believed. I told myself that it
would be interesting to watch his life, and to see the gradual, inevitable
humanizing of the man. So I entered his service, and have remained in it until
today."
<P>
He turned more directly towards Juliet. She was listening breathlessly to
every word.
<P>
"Juliet," he said, "he has kept his word. I have been by his side, and I speak
of the things I know. He has sought no one's friendship who has not suffered
for it, there is not a man or woman living who owes him the acknowledgment of
a single act of kindness. I have seen him deliberately scheme to bring about
the ruin of a harmless little woman. I have seen him exact his pound of flesh,
even at the cost of ruin, from a boy. I tell you, Juliet, of my own knowledge,
that he has neither heart nor conscience, and that he glories in the evil that
his hand finds to do. Even you must know something of his reputation--have
heard something of his doings, under the name he is best known by in
London--Mr. Wingrave, millionaire."
<P>
She started back as though in terror. Then she turned to Wingrave, who sat
stonily silent.
<P>
"It isn't true," she cried. "You are not--that man?"
<P>
He raised his eyes and looked at her. It seemed to her that there was
something almost satanic in the smile which alone disturbed the serenity of
his face.
<P>
"Certainly I am," he answered; "when I returned from America, it suited me to
change my identity. You must not doubt anything that Mr. Aynesworth says. I
can assure you that he is a most truthful and conscientious young man. I shall
be able to give him a testimonial with a perfectly clear conscience."
<P>
Juliet shuddered as she turned away. All the joy of life seemed to have gone
from her face.
<P>
"You are Mr. Wingrave--the Mr. Wingrave. Oh! I can't believe it," she broke
off suddenly. "No one could have been so kind, so generous, as you have been
to me."
<P>
She looked from one to the other of the two men. Both were silent, but whereas
Aynesworth had turned his head away, Wingrave's position and attitude were
unchanged. She moved suddenly over towards him. One hand fell almost
caressingly upon his shoulder. She looked eagerly into his face.
<P>
"Tell me--that it isn't all true," she begged. "Tell me that you kindness to
me, at least, was real--that you did not mean it to be for my unhappiness
afterwards. Please tell me that. I think if you asked me, if you cared to ask
me, that I could forgive everything else."
<P>
"Every vice, save one," Wingrave murmured, "Nature has lavished upon me. I am
a poor liar. It is perfectly true that my object in life has been exactly as
Aynesworth has stated it. I may have been more or less successful--Aynesworth
can tell you that, too. As regards yourself--"
<P>
"Yes?" she exclaimed.
<P>
"I congratulate you upon your escape," Wingrave said. "Aynesworth is right.
Association of any sort with me is for your evil!"
<P>
She covered her face with her hands. Even his tone was different. She felt
that this man was a stranger, and a stranger to be feared. Aynesworth came
over to her side and drew her away.
<P>
"I have a cart outside," he said. "I am going to take you to Truro--"
<P>
Wingrave heard the gate close after them--he heard the rumble of the cart in
the road growing fainter and fainter. He was alone now in the garden, and the
darkness was closing around him. He staggered to his feet. His face was back
in its old set lines. He was once more at war with the world.
