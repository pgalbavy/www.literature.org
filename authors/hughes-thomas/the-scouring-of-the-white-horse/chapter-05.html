<p>Now when we had fairly lighted up, and Joe had mixed us a glass
of gin and water a piece, I felt that it was a very good time
for me to have a talk about the White Horse and the scourings.
I wasn’t quite satisfied in my mind with all that the old gentleman
had told me on the hill; and, as I felt sure that Mr. Warton was
a scholar, and would find out directly if there was any thing
wrong in what I had taken down, I took out my note-book, and reminded
Joe that he had promised to listen to it over his pipe. Joe didn’t
half like it, and wanted to put the reading off, but Mr. Warton
was very good-natured about it, and said he should like to hear
it&mdash;so it was agreed that I should go on, and so I began. Joe
soon was dozing, and every now and then woke up with a jerk, and
pretended he had been listening, and made some remark in broad
Berkshire. He always talks much broader when he is excited, or
half asleep, than when he is cool and has all his wits about him.
But I kept on steadily till I had got through it all, and then
Mr. Warton said he had been very much interested, and believed
that all I had taken down was quite correct.</p>

<p>"What put it into your head," said he, "to take so much interest
in the Horse?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know, Sir," said I, "but somehow I can’t think of any
thing else now I have been up there and heard about the battle."
This wasn’t quite true, for I thought more of Miss Lucy, but I
couldn’t tell him that.</p>

<p>"When I was curate down here," said he, "I was bitten with the
same maggot. Nothing would serve me but to find out all I could
about the Horse. Now, Joe here, who’s fast asleep&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, he bean’t," said Joe starting, and giving a pull at his
pipe, which had gone out.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Joe here, who is wide awake, and the rest, who were
born within sight of him, and whose fathers fought at Ashdown,
and have helped to scour him ever since, don’t care half so much
for him as we strangers do."</p>

<p>"Oh! I dwon’t allow that, mind you," said Joe; "I dwon’t know
as I cares about your long-tailed words and that; but for keeping
the Horse in trim, and as should be, why, I be ready to pay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind how much, Joseph."</p>

<p>Joe grinned, and put his pipe in his mouth again. I think he
liked being interrupted by the Parson.</p>

<p>"As I was saying, I found out all I could about the Horse, though
it was little enough, and I shall be very glad to tell you all
I know."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir," said I, "may I ask you any questions I have a mind
to ask you about it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said he; "but you mustn’t expect to get much out
of me."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sir," said I. "A thousand years seems a long time,
Sir, doesn’t it? Now, how do we know that the Horse has been there
all that time?"</p>

<p>"At any rate," said he, "we know that the Hill has been called,
‘White Horse Hill,’ and the Vale, the ‘Vale of White Horse,’ ever
since the time of Henry the First; for there are cartularies of
the Abbey of Abingdon in the British Museum which prove it. So,
I think, we may assume that they were called after the figure,
and that the figure was there before that time."</p>

<p>"I’m very glad to hear that, Sir," said I. "And then about the
scourings and the pastime? They must have been going on ever since
the Horse was cut out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," said he. "You have got quotations there from
Wise’s letter, written in 1736. He says that the scouring was
an old custom in his time. Well, take his authority for the fact
up to that time, and I think I can put you in the way of finding
out something, though not much, about most of the Scourings which
have been held since."</p>

<p>And he was as good as his word; for he took me about after the
pastime to some old men in the neighbouring parishes, from whom
I found out a good deal that I have put down in this chapter.
And the Squire, too, when Joe told him what I was about, helped
me.</p>

<p>Now I can’t say that I have found out all the Scourings which
have been held since 1736, but I did my best to make a correct
list, and this seems to be the proper place to set it all down.</p>

<p>Well, the first Scouring, which I could find out any thing about,
was held in 1755, and all the sports then seem to have been pretty
much the same as those of the present day. But there was one thing
which happened which could not very well have happened now. A
fine dashing fellow, dressed like a gentleman, got on to the stage,
held his own against all the old gamesters, and in the end won
the chief prize for backsword-play, or cudgel-play, as they used
to call it.</p>

<p>While the play was going on there was plenty of talk as to who
this man could be, and some people thought they knew his face.
As soon as he had got the prize he jumped on his horse, and rode
off. Presently, first one, and then another, said it was Tim Gibbons,
of Lambourn, who had not been seen for some years, though strange
stories had been afloat about him.</p>

<p>It was the Squire who told me the story about Tim Gibbons; but
he took me to see an old man who was a descendant of Tim’s, and
so I think I had better give his own account of his ancestor and
his doings. We found the old gentleman, a hale, sturdy old fellow,
working away in a field at Woolstone, and, as near as I could
get it, this was what he had to say about the Scouring of 1755:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Squire.</em> "Good morning, Thomas. How about the weather?
Did the White Horse smoke his pipe this morning?"</p>

<p><em>Thos.</em> "Mornin’, Sir. I didn’t zee as ’a did. I allus
notices he doos it when the wind blaws moor to th’ east’ard. I
d’wont bode no rain to day, Sir."</p>

<p><em>Squire.</em> "How old are you, Thomas?"</p>

<p><em>Thos.</em> "Seventy year old this Christmas, Sir. I wur barn
at Woolstone, in the hard winter, when I’ve heard tell as volks
had to bwile their kettles wi’ the snaw."</p>

<p><em>Squire.</em> "I want to know something about your family,
Thomas."</p>

<p><em>Thos.</em> "Well, Sir, I bean’t no ways ashamed of my family,
I can assure ’ee. I’ve a got two zons, and vour daaters. One on
’em, that’s my oldest bwoy, Sir, wur all droo’ the Crimee wars,
and never got a scratch. In the Granadier Guards, Sir, he be.
A uncommon sprack[25] chap, Sir, though I says it, and as bowld
as a lion; only while he wur about our village wi’ t’other young
chaps, he must allus be a fighting. But not a bad-tempered chap,
Sir, I assure ’ee. Then, Sir&mdash;"</p>

<p><em>Squire.</em> "But, Thomas, I want to know about those that
came before you. What relation was Timothy Gibbons, whom I’ve
heard folks talk about, to you?"</p>

<p><em>Thos.</em> "I suppose as you means my great-grandvather,
Sir."</p>

<p><em>Squire.</em> "Perhaps so, Thomas. Where did he live, and
what trade did he follow?"</p>

<p><em>Thos.</em> "I’ll tell ’ee, Sir, all as I knows; but somehow,
vather and mother didn’t seem to like to talk to we bwoys about
’un."</p>

<p><em>Squire.</em> "Thank ’ee, Thomas. Mind, if he went wrong it’s
all the more credit to you, who have gone straight; for there
isn’t a more honest man in the next five parishes."</p>

<p><em>Thos.</em> "I knows your meanings good, and thank ’ee kindly,
Sir, tho’ I be no schollard. Well, Timothy Gibbons, my great grandvather,
you see, Sir, foller’d blacksmithing at Lambourn, till he took
to highway robbin’, but I can’t give ’ee no account o’ when or
wher.’ Arter he’d been out, may be dree or vour year, he and two
companions cum to Baydon; and whilst hiding theirselves and baiting
their hosses in a barn, the constables got ropes round the barn-yard
and lined ’em in. Then all dree drawed cuts[26] who was to go
out fust and face the constables. It fell to Tim’s two companions
to go fust, but their hearts failed ’em, and they wouldn’t go.
So Tim cried out as ‘he’d shew ’em what a Englishman could do,’
and mounted his hos and drawed his cutlash, and cut their lines
a-two, and galloped off clean away; but I understood as t’other
two was took. Arter that, may be a year or two, he cum down to
a pastime on White Hos Hill, and won the prize at backswording;
and when he took his money, fearing lest he should be knowed,
he jumped on his hos under the stage, and galloped right off,
and I don’t know as he ever cum again to these parts. Then I’ve
understood as things throve wi’ ’un, as ’um will at times, Sir,
wi’ thay sort o’ chaps, and he and his companions built the Inn
called ‘the Magpies,’ on Hounslow Heath; but I dwon’t know as
ever he kep’ the house hisself, except it med ha’ been for a short
while. Howsomever, at last he was took drinking at a public-house,
someweres up Hounslow way, wi’ a companion who played a cross
wi’ ’un, and I b’live ’a was hanged at Newgate. But I never understood
as he killed any body, Sir, and a’d used to gie some o’ the money
as he took to the poor, if he knowed they was in want."</p>

<p><em>Squire.</em> "Thank’ee, Thomas. What a pity he didn’t go
soldiering; he might have made a fine fellow then!"</p>

<p><em>Thos.</em> "Well, Sir, so t’wur, I thinks. Our fam’ly be
given to that sort o’ thing. I wur a good hand at elbow and collar
wrastling myself, afore I got married; but then I gied up all
that, and ha’ stuck to work ever sence."</p>

<p><em>Squire.</em> "Well, Thomas, you’ve given me the story I wanted
to hear, so it’s fair I should give you a Sunday dinner."</p>

<p><em>Thos.</em> "Lord love ’ee, Sir, I never meant nothin’ o’
that sort; our fam’ly"&mdash;</p>

<p>We were half-way across the field, when I looked round, and saw
old Thomas still looking after us and holding the Squire’s silver
in his hand, evidently not comfortable in his mind at having failed
in telling us all he had to say about <em>his fam’ly</em>, of
which he seemed as proud as any duke can be of his, and I dare
say has more reason for his pride than many of them. At last,
however, as we got over the stile, he pocketed the affront and
went on with his work.</p>

<p>I could find out nothing whatever about the next Scouring; but
I was lucky enough to get the printed hand-bill which was published
before the one in 1776, which I made out to be the next but one
after that at which Tim Gibbons played.</p>

<p>When I showed this old hand-bill to the Parson he was very much
tickled. He took up the one which the Committee put out this last
time, and looked at them together for a minute, and then tossed
them across to me.</p>

<p>"What a queer contrast," said he, "between those two bills."</p>

<p>"How do you mean, Sir?" said I; "why the games seem to be nearly
the same."</p>

<p>"So they are," said he; "but look at the prizes. Our great grandfathers,
you’ll see, gave no money prizes; we scarcely any others. The
gold-laced hat and buckskin breeches have gone, and current coin
of the realm reigns supreme. Then look at the happy-go-lucky way
in which the old bill is put out. No date given, no name signed!
who was responsible for the breeches, or the shoe-buckles? And
then, what grammar! The modern bill, you see, is in the shape
of resolutions, passed at a meeting, the chairman’s name being
appended as security for the prizes."</p>

<p>"That seems much better and more business-like," said I.</p>

<p>"Then you see the horserace for a silver cup has disappeared,"
he went on. "Epsom and Ascot have swallowed up the little country
races, just as big manufacturers swallow up little ones, and big
shops whole streets of little shops, and nothing but monsters
flourish in this age of unlimited competition and general enlightenment.
Not that I regret the small country town-races, though."</p>

<p>"And I see, Sir, that ‘smocks to be run for by ladies,’ is left
out in the modern bill."</p>

<p>"A move in the right direction there, at any rate," said he;
"the bills ought to be published side by side." So I took his
advice, and here they are:&mdash;</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Then came a Scouring on Whit-Monday, May 15, 1780, and of the
doings on that occasion, there is the following notice in the
"Reading Mercury" of May 22, 1780:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The ceremony of scowering and cleansing that noble monument
of Saxon antiquity, the White Horse, was celebrated on Whit-Monday,
with great joyous festivity. Besides the customary diversions
of horseracing, foot-races, &amp;c. many uncommon rural diversions
and feats of activity were exhibited to a greater number of spectators
than ever assembled on any former occasion. Upwards of thirty
thousand persons were present, and amongst them most of the nobility
and gentry of this and the neighbouring counties; and the whole
was concluded without any material accident. The origin of this
remarkable piece of antiquity is variously related; but most authors
describe it as a monument to perpetuate some signal victory, gained
near the spot, by some of our most ancient Saxon princes. The
space occupied by this figure is more than an acre of ground."</p>

<p>I also managed to get a list of the games, which is just the
same as the one of 1776, except that in addition there was "a
jingling-match by eleven blindfolded men, and one unmasked and
hung with bells, for a pair of buckskin breeches."</p>

<p>The Parson found an old man, William Townsend by name, a carpenter
at Woolstone, whose father, one Warman Townsend, had run down
the manger after the fore-wheel of a wagon, and won the cheese
at this Scouring. He told us the story as his father had told
it to him, how that "eleven on ’em started, and amongst ’em a
sweep chimley and a millurd; and the millurd tripped up the sweep
chimley and made the zoot flee a good ’un;" and how "the wheel
ran pretty nigh down to the springs that time," which last statement
the Parson seemed to think couldn’t be true. But old Townsend
knew nothing about the other sports.</p>

<p>Then the next Scouring was held in 1785, and the Parson found
several old men who could remember it when they were very little.
The one who was most communicative was old William Ayres of Uffington,
a very dry old gentleman, about eighty-four years old:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I wur a bwoy about ten years old," said he, "I remembers
I went up White Hoss Hill wi’ my vather to a pastime. Vather’d
brewed a barrel o’ beer to sell on the Hill&mdash;a deal better times
then than now, Sir!"</p>

<p>"Why, William?" said the Parson.</p>

<p>"Augh! bless’ee, Sir, a man medn’t brew and sell his own beer
now; and oftentimes he can’t get nothin’ fit to drink at thaay
little beer-houses as is licensed, nor at some o’ the public-houses
too for that matter. But ’twur not only for that as the times
wur better then, you see, Sir&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But about the sports, William?"</p>

<p>"Ees Sir, I wur gandering sure enough," said the old man; "well
now, there wur Varmer Mifflin’s mare run for and won a new cart
saddle and thill-tugs&mdash;the mare’s name wur <em>Duke</em>. As many
as a dozen or moor horses run, and they started from Idle’s Bush,
which wur a vine owld tharnin’-tree in thay days&mdash;a very nice
bush. They started from Idle’s Bush, as I tell ’ee, Sir, and raced
up to the Rudge-waay; and Varmer Mifflin’s mare had it all one
way, and beat all the t’other on ’um holler. The pastime then
wur a good ’un&mdash;a wunderful sight o’ volk of all sorts, rich and
poor. John Morse of Uffington, a queerish sort of a man, grinned
agin another chap droo’ hos collars, but John got beaat&mdash;a fine
bit of spwoort to be shure, Sir, and made the folks laaf. Another
geaam wur to bowl a cheese down the Mainger, and the first as
could catch ’un had ’un. The cheese was a tough ’un and held together."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, William, that’s impossible," broke in the Parson.</p>

<p>"Augh Sir, but a did though, I assure ’ee," persisted William
Ayres, "but thaay as tasted ’un said a warn’t very capital arter
all."</p>

<p>"I daresay," said the Parson, "for he couldn’t have been made
of any thing less tough than ash pole."</p>

<p>"Hah, hah, hah," chuckled the old man, and went on.</p>

<p>"There wur running for a peg too, and they as could ketch ’un
and hang ’un up by the tayl, had ’un. The girls, too, run races
for smocks&mdash;a deal of pastime, to be sure, Sir. There wur climmin’
a grasy pole for a leg of mutton, too; and backsoordin’, and wrastlin’,
and all that, ye knows, Sir. A man by the name of Blackford, from
the low countries, Zummersetshire, or that waay some weres, he
won the prize, and wur counted the best hand for years arter,
and no man couldn’t break his yead; but at last, nigh about twenty
years arter, I’ll warn[28] ’twur&mdash;at Shrin’um Revel, Harry Stanley,
the landlord of the Blawin’ Stwun, broke his yead, and the low-country
men seemed afeard o’ Harry round about here for long arter that.
Varmer Small-bwones of Sparsholt, a mazin’ stout man, and one
as scarce no wun go where ’a would could drow down, beaat all
the low-country chaps at wrastlin’, and none could stan’ agean
’un. And so he got the neam o’ Varmer Greaat Bwones. ’Twur only
when he got a drap o’ beer a leetle too zoon, as he wur ever drowed
at wrastlin’, but they never drowed ’un twice, and he had the
best men come agean ’un for miles. This wur the first pastime
as I well remembers, but there med ha’ been some afore, for all
as I knows. I ha’ got a good memorandum, Sir, and minds things
well when I wur a bwoy, that I does. I ha’ helped to dress the
White Hoss myself, and a deal o’ work ’tis to do’t as should be,
I can asshure ’ee, Sir. About Claay Hill, ’twixt Fairford and
Ziziter, I’ve many a time looked back at ’un, and ’a looks as
nat’ral as a pictur, Sir."</p>

<p>Between 1785 and 1803 there must have been at least two Scourings,
but somehow none of the old men could remember the exact years,
and they seemed to confuse them with those that came later on,
and though I looked for them in old county papers, I could not
find any notice of them.</p>

<p>At the Scouring of 1803, Beckingham of Baydon won the prize at
wrestling; Flowers and Ellis from Somersetshire won the prize
at backsword play; the waiter at the Bell Inn, Farringdon, won
the cheese race, and at jumping in sacks; and Thomas Street, of
Niton, won the prize for grinning through horse collars, "but,"
as my informant told me, "a man from Woodlands would ha’ beaat,
only he’d got no teeth. This geaam made the congregation laaf
’mazinly."</p>

<p>Then came a Scouring in 1808, at which the Hanney men came down
in a strong body and made sure of winning the prize for wrestling.
But all the other gamesters leagued against them, and at last
their champion, Belcher, was thrown by Fowler of Baydon;&mdash;both
these men are still living. Two men, "with very shiny top-boots,
quite gentlemen, from London," won the prize for backsword play,
one of which gentlemen was Shaw, the life-guardsman, a Wiltshire
man himself as I was told, who afterwards died at Waterloo after
killing so many cuirassiers. A new prize was given at this pastime
and a very blackguard one, viz: a gallon of gin or half a guinea
for the woman who would smoke most tobacco in an hour. Only two
gypsy women entered, and it seems to have been a very abominable
business, but it is the only instance of the sort that I could
hear of at any Scouring.</p>

<p>The old men disagree as to the date of the next Scouring, which
was either in 1812 or 1813; but I think in the latter year, because
the clerk of Kingstone Lisle, an old Peninsula man, says that
he was at home on leave in this year, and that there was to be
a Scouring. And all the people were talking about it when he had
to go back to the wars. At this Scouring there was a prize of
a loaf made out of a bushel of flour, for running up the manger,
which was won by Philip New, of Kingstone-in-the-Hole; who cut
the great loaf into pieces at the top, and sold the pieces for
a penny a piece. I am sure he must have deserved a great many
pennies for running up that place, if he really ever did it; for
I would just as soon undertake to run up the front of the houses
in Holborn. The low country men won the first backsword prize,
and one Ford, of Ashbury, the second; and the Baydon men, headed
by Beckingham, Fowler, and Breakspear, won the prize for wrestling.
One Henry Giles (of Hanney, I think they said) had wrestled for
the prize, and I suppose took too much beer afterwards; at any
rate, he fell into the canal on his way home and was drowned.
So the jury found, "Killed at wrastlin’;" "though," as my informant
said, "’twur a strange thing for a old geamster as knew all about
the stage, to be gettin’ into the water for a bout. Hows’mever,
Sir, I hears as they found it as I tells ’ee, and you med see
it any day as you’ve a mind to look in the parish register."</p>

<p>Then I couldn’t find that there had been another Scouring till
1825, but the one which took place in that year seems by all accounts
to have been the largest gathering that there has ever been. The
games were held at the Seven Barrows, which are distant two miles
in a southeasterly direction from the White Horse, instead of
in Uffington Castle; but I could not make out why. These seven
barrows, I heard the Squire say, are probably the burial-places
of the principal men who were killed at Ashdown, and near them
are other long irregular mounds, all full of bones huddled together
anyhow, which are very likely the graves of the rank and file.</p>

<p>After this there was no Scouring till 1838, when, on the 19th
and 20th of September, the old custom was revived, under the patronage
of Lord Craven. The <em>Reading Mercury</em> congratulates its
readers on the fact, and adds that no more auspicious year could
have been chosen for the revival, "than that in which our youthful
and beloved Queen first wore the British crown, and in which an
heir was born to the ancient and noble house of Craven, whom God
preserve." I asked the Parson if he knew why it was that such
a long time had been let to pass between the 1825 Scouring and
the next one.</p>

<p>"You see it was a transition time," said he; "old things were
passing away. What with Catholic Emancipation, and Reform, and
the new Poor Law, even the quiet folk in the Vale had no time
or heart to think about pastimes; and machine-breaking and rick-burning
took the place of wrestling and backsword play."</p>

<p>"But then, Sir," said I, "this last fourteen years we haven’t
had any Reform Bill (worse luck) and yet there was no Scouring
between 1843 and 1857."</p>

<p>"Why can’t you be satisfied with my reason?" said he; "now you
must find one out for yourself."</p>

<p>The last Scouring, in September, 1843, Joe had been at himself,
and told me a long story about, which I should be very glad to
repeat, only I think it would rather interfere with my own story
of what I saw myself. The Berkshire and Wiltshire men, under Joe
Giles of Shrivenham, got the better of the Somersetshire men,
led by Simon Stone, at backsword play; and there were two men
who came down from London, who won the wrestling prize away from
the countrymen. "What I remember best, however," said Joe, "was
all the to-do to get the elephant’s caravan up the hill, for Wombwell’s
menagerie came down on purpose for the Scouring. I should think
they put-to a matter of four-and-twenty horses, and then stuck
fast four or five times. I was a little chap then but I sat and
laughed at ’em a good one; and I don’t know that I’ve seen so
foolish a job since."</p>

<p>"I don’t see why, Joe," said I.</p>

<p>"You don’t?" said he, "well, that’s good, too. Why didn’t they
turn the elephant out and make him pull his own caravan up? He
would have been glad to do it, poor old chap, to get a breath
of fresh air, and a look across the vale."</p>

<p>But now that I have finished all that I have to tell about the
old Scourings, (at least all that I expect any body will read,)
I must go back again to the kitchen on the night of the 16th of
September, 1857. Joe, who, as I said, was half asleep while I
was reading, soon waked up afterwards, though it was past eleven
o’clock, and began to settle how we were to go up the hill the
next morning.</p>

<p>"Now I shall ride the chestnut up early," said he, "’cause I
may be wanted to help the Squire and the rest, but it don’t matter
for the rest of you. I’ll have a saddle put on my old brown horse,
and he’ll be quiet enough, for he has been at harvest work, and
the four-wheel must come up with Lu somehow. Will you ride or
drive, Sir?" said he, turning to the Parson.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don’t mind; whichever is most convenient," said Mr. Warton.</p>

<p>"Did’st ever drive in thy life, Dick?" said Joe to me.</p>

<p>I was very near saying "yes," for I felt ashamed of not being
able to do what they could; however, I told the truth, and said
"no;" and next minute I was very glad I had, for, besides the
shame of telling a lie, how much worse it would have been to be
found out by Miss Lucy in the morning, or to have had an upset
or some accident.</p>

<p>So it was settled that Mr. Warton should drive the four-wheel,
and that I should ride the old horse. I didn’t think it necessary
to say that I had never ridden any thing but the donkeys on Hampstead
Heath, and the elephant in the Zoological Gardens. And so, when
all was settled, we went to bed.</p>
