<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Once at Edinburgh College I had read the Latin tale of Apuleius,
and the beginning stuck in my memory: "<em>Thraciam ex negotio
petebam</em>"&mdash;"I was starting off for Thrace on business." That
was my case now. I was about to plunge into a wild world for no
more startling causes than that I was a trader who wanted to save
my pocket. It is to those who seek only peace and a quiet life
that adventures fall; the homely merchant, jogging with his pack
train, finds the enchanted forest and the sleeping princess; and
Saul, busily searching for his father's asses, stumbles upon a
kingdom.</p>

<p>"What seek ye with Ringan?" Mercer asked, when we had sat down
inside with locked doors.</p>

<p>"The man's name is Ninian Campbell," I said, somewhat puzzled.</p>

<p>"Well, it's the same thing. What did they teach you at Lesmahagow
if ye don't know that Ringan is the Scots for Ninian? Lord bless
me, laddie, don't tell me ye've never heard of Red Ringan?"</p>

<p>To be sure I had; I had heard of little else for a twelvemonth.
In every tavern in Virginia, when men talked of the Free Companions,
it was the name of Red Ringan that came first to their tongues.
I had been too occupied by my own affairs to listen just then
to fireside tales, but I could not help hearing of this man's
exploits. He was a kind of leader of the buccaneers, and by all
accounts no miscreant like Cosh, but a mirthful fellow, striking
hard when need be, but at other times merciful and jovial. Now
I set little store by your pirate heroes. They are for lads and
silly girls and sots in an ale-house, and a merchant can have
no kindness for those who are the foes of his trade. So when I
heard that the man I sought was this notorious buccaneer I showed
my alarm by dropping my jaw.</p>

<p>Mercer laughed. "I'll not conceal from you that you take a certain
risk in going to Ringan. Ye need not tell me your business, but
it should be a grave one to take you down to the Carolina keys.
There's time to draw back, if ye want; but you've brought me the
master word, and I'm bound to set you on the road. Just one word
to ye, Mr. Garvald. Keep a stout face whatever you see, for Ringan
has a weakness for a bold man. Be here the morn at sunrise, and
if ye're wise bring no weapon. I'll see to the boat and the provisioning."</p>

<p>I was at the water-side next day at cock-crow, while the mist
was still low on the river. Mercer was busy putting food and a
keg of water into a light sloop, and a tall Indian was aboard
redding out the sails. My travels had given me some knowledge
of the red tribes, and I spoke a little of their language, but
this man was of a type not often seen in the Virginian lowlands.
He was very tall, with a skin clear and polished like bronze,
and, unlike the ordinary savage, his breast was unmarked, and
his hair unadorned. He was naked to the waist, and below wore
long leather breeches, dyed red, and fringed with squirrels' tails.
In his wampum belt were stuck a brace of knives and a tomahawk.
It seemed he knew me, for as I approached he stood up to his full
height and put his hands on his forehead. "Brother," he said,
and his grave eyes looked steadily into mine.</p>

<p>Then I remembered. Some months before I had been riding back
the road from Green Springs, and in a dark, woody place had come
across an Indian sore beset by three of the white scum which infested
the river-side. What the quarrel was I know not, but I liked little
the villainous look of the three, and I liked much the clean,
lithe figure of their opponent. So I rode my horse among them,
and laid on to them with the butt of my whip. They had their knives
out, but I managed to disarm the one who attacked me, and my horse
upset a second, while the Indian, who had no weapon but a stave,
cracked the head of the last. I got nothing worse than a black
eye, but the man I had rescued bled from some ugly cuts which
I had much ado stanching. He shook hands with me gravely when
I had done, and vanished into the thicket. He was a Seneca Indian,
and I wondered what one of that house was doing in the Tidewater.</p>

<p>Mercer told me his name. "Shalah will take you to the man you
ken. Do whatever he tells you, Mr. Garvald, for this is a job
in which you're nothing but a bairn." We pushed off, the Indian
taking the oars, and in five minutes James Town was lost in the
haze.</p>

<p>On the Surrey shore we picked up a breeze, and with the ebbing
tide made good speed down the estuary. Shalah the Indian had the
tiller, and I sat luxuriously in the bows, smoking my cob pipe,
and wondering what the next week held in store for me. The night
before I had had qualms about the whole business, but the air
of morning has a trick of firing my blood, and I believe I had
forgotten the errand which was taking me to the Carolina shores.
It was enough that I was going into a new land and new company.
Last night I had thought with disfavour of Red Ringan the buccaneer;
that morning I thought only of Ninian Campbell, with whom I had
forgathered on a Glasgow landing.</p>

<p>My own thoughts kept me silent, and the Indian never opened his
mouth. Like a statue he crouched by the tiller, with his sombre
eyes looking to the sea. That night, when we had rounded Cape
Henry in fine weather, we ran the sloop into a little bay below
a headland, and made camp for the night beside a stream of cold
water. Next morning it blew hard from the north, and in a driving
rain we crept down the Carolina coast. One incident of the day
I remember. I took in a reef or two, and adjusted the sheets,
for this was a game I knew and loved. The Indian watched me closely,
and made a sign to me to take the helm. He had guessed that I
knew more than himself about the handling of a boat in wind, and
since we were in an open sea, where his guidance was not needed,
he preferred to trust the thing to me. I liked the trait in him,
for I take it to be a mark of a wise man that he knows what he
can do, and is not ashamed to admit what he cannot.</p>

<p>That evening we had a cold bed; but the storm blew out in the
night, and the next day the sun was as hot as summer, and the
wind a point to the east. Shalah once again was steersman, for
we were inside some very ugly reefs, which I took to be the beginning
of the Carolina keys. On shore forests straggled down to the sea,
so that sometimes they almost had their feet in the surf; but
now and then would come an open, grassy space running far inland.
These were, the great savannahs where herds of wild cattle and
deer roamed, and where the Free Companions came to fill their
larders. It was a wilder land than the Tidewater, for only once
did we see a human dwelling. Far remote on the savannahs I could
pick out twirls of smoke rising into the blue weather, the signs
of Indian hunting fires. Shalah began now to look for landmarks,
and to take bearings of a sort. Among the maze of creeks and shallow
bays which opened on the land side it needed an Indian to pick
out a track.</p>

<p>The sun had all but set when, with a grunt of satisfaction, he
swung round the tiller and headed shorewards. Before me in the
twilight I saw only a wooded bluff which, as we approached, divided
itself into two. Presently a channel appeared, a narrow thing
about as broad as a cable's length, into which the wind carried
us. Here it was very dark, the high sides with their gloomy trees
showing at the top a thin line of reddening sky. Shalah hugged
the starboard shore, and as the screen of the forest caught the
wind it weakened and weakened till it died away, and we moved
only with the ingoing tide. I had never been in so eery a place.
It was full of the sharp smell of pine trees, and as I sniffed
the air I caught the savour of wood smoke. Men were somewhere
ahead of us in the gloom.</p>

<p>Shalah ran the sloop into a little creek so overgrown with vines
that we had to lie flat on the thwarts to enter. Then, putting
his mouth to my ear, he spoke for the first time since we had
left James Town. "It is hard to approach the Master, and my brother
must follow me close as the panther follows the deer. Where Shalah
puts his foot let my brother put his also. Come."</p>

<p>He stepped from the boat to the hill-side, and with incredible
speed and stillness began to ascend. His long, soft strides were
made without noise or effort, whether the ground were moss, or
a tangle of vines, or loose stones, or the trunks of fallen trees,
I had prided myself on my hill-craft, but beside the Indian I
was a blundering child, I might have made shift to travel as fast,
but it was the silence of his progress that staggered me, I plunged,
and slipped, and sprawled, and my heart was bursting before the
ascent ceased, and we stole to the left along the hill shoulder.</p>

<p>Presently came a gap in the trees, and I looked down in the last
greyness of dusk on a strange and beautiful sight. The channel
led to a landlocked pool, maybe a mile around, and this was as
full of shipping as a town's harbour. The water was but a pit
of darkness, but I could make out the masts rising into the half
light, and I counted more than twenty vessels in that port. No
light was shown, and the whole place was quiet as a grave.</p>

<p>We entered a wood of small hemlocks, and I felt rather than saw
the ground slope in front of us. About two hundred feet above
the water the glen of a little stream shaped itself into a flat
cup, which was invisible from below, and girdled on three sides
by dark forest. Here we walked more freely, till we came to the
lip of the cup, and there, not twenty paces below me, I saw a
wonderful sight. The hollow was lit with the glow of a dozen fires,
round which men clustered. Some were busy boucanning meat for
ship's food, some were cooking supper, some sprawled in idleness,
and smoked or diced. The night had now grown very black around
us, and we were well protected, for the men in the glow had their
eyes dazed, and could not spy into the darkness. We came very
close above them, so that I could hear their talk. The smell of
roasting meat pricked my hunger, and I realized that the salt
air had given me a noble thirst. They were common seamen from
the pirate vessels, and, as far as I could judge, they had no
officer among them. I remarked their fierce, dark faces, and the
long knives with which they slashed and trimmed the flesh for
their boucanning.</p>

<p>Shalah touched my hand, and I followed him into the wood. We
climbed again, and from the tinkle of the stream on my left I
judged that we were ascending to a higher shelf in the glen. The
Indian moved very carefully, as noiseless as the flight of an
owl, and I marvelled at the gift. In after days I was to become
something of a woodsman, and track as swiftly and silently as
any man of my upbringing. But I never mastered the Indian art
by which the foot descending in the darkness on something that
will crackle checks before the noise is made. I could do it by
day, when I could see what was on the ground, but in the dark
the thing was beyond me. It is an instinct like a wild thing's,
and possible only to those who have gone all their days light-shod
in the forest.</p>

<p>Suddenly the slope and the trees ceased, and a new glare burst
on our eyes. This second shelf was smaller than the first, and
as I blinked at the light I saw that it held about a score of
men. Torches made of pine boughs dipped in tar blazed at the four
corners of the assembly, and in the middle on a boulder a man
was sitting. He was speaking loudly, and with passion, but I could
not make him out. Once more Shalah put his mouth to my ear, with
a swift motion like a snake, and whispered, "The Master."</p>

<p>We crawled flat on our bellies round the edge of the cup. The
trees had gone, and the only cover was the long grass and the
low sumach bushes. We moved a foot at a time, and once the Indian
turned in his tracks and crawled to the left almost into the open.
My sense of smell, as sharp almost as a dog's, told me that horses
were picketed in the grass in front of us. Our road took us within,
hearing of the speaker, and though I dared not raise my head,
I could hear the soft Highland voice of my friend. He seemed now
to be speaking humorously, for a laugh came from the hearers.</p>

<p>Once at the crossing of a little brook, I pulled a stone into
the water, and we instantly lay as still as death. But men preoccupied
with their own concerns do not keep anxious watch, and our precautions
were needless. Presently we had come to the far side of the shelf
abreast of the boulder on which he sat who seemed to be the chief
figure. Now I could raise my head, and what I saw made my eyes
dazzle.</p>

<p>Red Ringan sat on a stone with a naked cutlass across his knees.
In front stood a man, the most evil-looking figure that I had
ever beheld. He was short but very sturdily built, and wore a
fine laced coat not made for him, which hung to his knees, and
was stretched tight at the armpits. He had a heavy pale face,
without hair on it. His teeth had gone, all but two buck-teeth
which stuck out at each corner of his mouth, giving him the look
of a tusker. I could see his lips moving uneasily in the glare
of the pine boughs, and his eyes darted about the company as if
seeking countenance.</p>

<p>Ringan was speaking very gravely, with his eyes shining like
sword points. The others were every make and manner of fellow,
from well-shaped and well-clad gentlemen to loutish seamen in
leather jerkins. Some of the faces were stained dark with passion
and crime, some had the air of wild boys, and some the hard sobriety
of traders. But one and all were held by the dancing eyes of the
man that spoke.</p>

<p>"What is the judgment," he was saying, "of the Free Companions?
By the old custom of the Western Seas I call upon you, gentlemen
all, for your decision."</p>

<p>Then I gathered that the evil-faced fellow had offended against
some one of their lawless laws, and was on his trial.</p>

<p>No one spoke for a moment, and then one grizzled seaman raised
his hand, "The dice must judge," he said. "He must throw for his
life against the six."</p>

<p>Another exclaimed against this. "Old wives' folly," he cried,
with an oath. "Let Cosh go his ways, and swear to amend them.
The Brethren of the Coast cannot be too nice in these little matters.
We are not pursy justices or mooning girls."</p>

<p>But he had no support. The verdict was for the dice, and a seaman
brought Ringan a little ivory box, which he held out to the prisoner.
The latter took it with shaking hand, as if he did not know how
to use it.</p>

<p>"You will cast thrice," said Ringan. "Two even throws, and you
are free."</p>

<p>The man fumbled a little and then cast. It fell a four.</p>

<p>A second time he threw, and the dice lay five.</p>

<p>In that wild place, in the black heart of night, the terror of
the thing fell on my soul. The savage faces, the deadly purpose
in Ringan's eyes, the fumbling miscreant before him, were all
heavy with horror. I had no doubt that Cosh was worthy of death,
but this cold and merciless treatment froze my reason. I watched
with starting eyes the last throw, and I could not hear Ringan
declare it. But I saw by the look on Cosh's face what it had been.</p>

<p>"It is your privilege to choose your manner of death and to name
your successor," I heard Ringan say.</p>

<p>But Cosh did not need the invitation. Now that his case was desperate,
the courage in him revived. He was fully armed, and in a second
he had drawn a knife and leaped for Ringan's throat.</p>

<p>Perhaps he expected it, perhaps he had learned the art of the
wild beast so that his body was answerable to his swiftest wish.
I do not know, but I saw Cosh's knife crash on the stone and splinter,
while Ringan stood by his side.</p>

<p>"You have answered my question," he said quietly. "Draw your
cutlass, man. You have maybe one chance in ten thousand for your
life."</p>

<p>I shut my eyes as I heard the steel clash. Then very soon came
silence. I looked again, and saw Ringan wiping his blade on a
bunch of grass, and a body lying before him.</p>

<p>He was speaking&mdash;speaking, I suppose, about the successor to
the dead man, whom two negroes had promptly removed. Suddenly
at my shoulder Shalah gave the hoot of an owl, followed at a second's
interval by a second and a third. I suppose it was some signal
agreed with Ringan, but at the time I thought the man had gone
mad.</p>

<p>I was not very sane myself. What I had seen had sent a cold grue
through me, for I had never before seen a man die violently, and
the circumstances of the place and hour made the thing a thousandfold
more awful. I had a black fright on me at that whole company of
merciless men, and especially at Ringan, whose word was law to
them. Now the worst effect of fear is that it obscures good judgment,
and makes a man in desperation do deeds of a foolhardiness from
which at other times he would shrink. All I remembered in that
moment was that I had to reach Ringan, and that Mercer had told
me that the safest plan was to show a bold front. I never remembered
that I had also been bidden to follow Shalah, nor did I reflect
that a secret conclave of pirates was no occasion to choose for
my meeting. With a sudden impulse I forced myself to my feet,
and stalked, or rather shambled, into the light.</p>

<p>"Ninian," I cried, "Ninian Campbell! I'm here to claim your promise."</p>

<p>The whole company turned on me, and I was gripped by a dozen
hands and flung on the ground. Ringan came forward to look, but
there was no recognition in his eyes. Some one cried out, "A spy!"
and there was a fierce murmur of voices, which were meaningless
to me, for fear had got me again, and I had neither ears nor voice.
Dimly it seemed that he gave some order, and I was trussed up
with ropes. Then I was conscious of being carried out of the glare
of torches into the cool darkness. Presently I was laid in some
kind of log-house, carpeted with fir boughs, for the needles tickled
my face.</p>

<p>Bit by bit my senses came back to me, and I caught hold of my
vagrant courage.</p>

<p>A big negro in seaman's clothes with a scarlet sash round his
middle was squatted on the floor watching me by the light of a
ship's lantern. He had a friendly, foolish face, and I remember
yet how he rolled his eyeballs.</p>

<p>"I won't run away," I said, "so you might slacken these ropes
and let me breathe easy."</p>

<p>Apparently he was an accommodating gaoler, for he did as I wished.</p>

<p>"And give me a drink," I said, "for my tongue's like a stick."</p>

<p>He mixed me a pannikin of rum and water. Perhaps he hocussed
it, or maybe 'twas only the effect of spirits on a weary body;
but three minutes after I had drunk I was in a heavy sleep.</p>
