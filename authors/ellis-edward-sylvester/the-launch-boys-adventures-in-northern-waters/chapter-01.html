<p>Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes were having a merry time in the
home of Mike Murphy, when a servant knocked and made known that
a caller was awaiting Alvin in the handsome bungalow belonging
to his father. I have told you how the boys hurried thither, wondering
who he could be, and how they were astonished to find him the
"man in gray," who had become strangely mixed up in their affairs
during the preceding few days.</p>

<p>But Alvin was a young gentleman, and asked the stranger to resume
his seat, as he and Chester set the example. They noticed that
the visitor was without the handbag which had hitherto seemed
a part of his personality. Self-possessed and vaguely smiling,
he spoke in an easy, pleasant voice:</p>

<p>"Of course you are surprised to receive a call from me." He addressed
Alvin, who replied:</p>

<p>"I don't deny it. Heretofore you have seemed more anxious to
keep out of our way than to meet us."</p>

<p>"I admit that it did have that look, but the cause exists no
longer."</p>

<p>This remark did not enlighten the youths. Chester for a time
took no part in the conversation. He listened and studied the
man while awaiting an explanation of what certainly had the appearance
of a curious proceeding.</p>

<p>"I don't understand what could have been the cause in the first
place," said Alvin, "nor why my friend and myself should have
been of any interest at all to you."</p>

<p>The other laughed lightly, as if the curt remark pleased him.</p>

<p>"I have no wish to play the mysterious; my name is Stockham Calvert."</p>

<p>It was Alvin's turn to smile, while Chester said meaningly:</p>

<p>"That tells us mighty little."</p>

<p>"I am one of Pinkerton's detectives."</p>

<p>The listeners started. They had never dreamed of anything of
this nature, and remained silent until he should say more.</p>

<p>"You are aware," continued the mild spoken caller, "that there
have been a number of post office robberies in the southern part
of Maine during the last six months and even longer ago than that."</p>

<p>The boys nodded.</p>

<p>"A professional detective doesn't know his business when he proclaims
his purpose to the world. He does so in the story books, but would
be a fool to be so imprudent in actual life. Consequently you
will think it strange for me to take you into my confidence."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt you have an explanation to give," suggested Alvin.</p>

<p>"I have and it is this. Without any purpose or thought on your
part you have become mixed up in the business. The other night
you gave me great help, though the fact never entered your minds
at the time. You located their boat in a small inlet at the southern
extremity of Barter Island."</p>

<p>At this point Chester Haynes asked his first question:</p>

<p>"How do you know we did?"</p>

<p>Mr. Stockham Calvert indulged in a low laugh.</p>

<p>"Surely I did not follow you thither without learning all you
did. Your conversation on the steamer gave me the information
I wished. I did not expect you to succeed as well as you did."</p>

<p>"Why did you avoid us? Why didn't you take us into your confidence
from the first?" asked Chester.</p>

<p>"I had several reasons, but I see now it would have been as well
had I done so. However, let that go. My errand here to-night is
to ask you whether you will not assist me in running down these
criminals."</p>

<p>The abrupt proposition caused a start on the part of the youths,
who looked wonderingly into each other's face. It was Alvin who
replied:</p>

<p>"Assist you! What help can <em>we</em> give?"</p>

<p>"You have the fleetest motor boat on the Maine coast. It must
be capable of twenty miles an hour."</p>

<p>"It is guaranteed to make twenty-four."</p>

<p>"Better yet. These men have a boat which closely resembles yours."</p>

<p>"And its name is the <em>Water Witch</em>," said Chester. "I
wish Captain Landon could run a race with it."</p>

<p>"He can have the chance if he will agree."</p>

<p>"I fail to see how. Those men after committing their crimes are
not going to spend their time in running up and down the Sheepscot
or Kennebec."</p>

<p>"Not wholly, but I don't see any particular risk they incur in
doing so. If they are pressed hard they can put into some bay
or branch or inlet and take to the woods."</p>

<p>"Still I do not understand how we can help you, Mr. Calvert,"
said Alvin.</p>

<p>"It is possible you cannot, but more probably you can. While
cruising in these waters, we may catch sight of their boat, and
you can see the advantage of being able to outspeed it. But do
not think I am looking for a battle between you and me on the
one hand, and the criminals on the other. I wish to employ the
<em>Deerfoot</em> as a scout. I can't express myself better than
by that word."</p>

<p>Whatever the right name of the caller might be, he was a good
judge of human nature. He saw the sparkle in the eyes before him.
While the lads would not have been averse to a scrimmage, neither
dared incur such risk without the consent of his father, and you
do not need to be told that such consent was out of the question.</p>

<p>"As I understand it, then, our boat promises to be useful to
you solely on account of its speed?" said Alvin inquiringly asked
the detective.</p>

<p>"Precisely. What is your answer?"</p>

<p>The young Captain looked at his second mate.</p>

<p>"How does it strike you, Chester?"</p>

<p>"I'm with you if you wish to make the experiment. If things don't
turn out as we wish we can withdraw at any time."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall expect to pay you for your services&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Then you will be disappointed," interrupted Alvin crisply. "The
<em>Deerfoot</em> isn't for hire, and if we go into this it will
be for the fun we hope to get out of it."</p>

<p>"I think I can guarantee you some entertainment. I presume you
two will be the only ones on the boat beside myself."</p>

<p>"You mustn't overlook my first mate, Mike Murphy. It would break
his heart if we should go on a cruise and leave him behind."</p>

<p>"I am afraid he is too impetuous and too fond of a fight."</p>

<p>"He may have a weakness in those directions, but his good nature,
pluck and devotion to my friend and me more than make up."</p>

<p>"It strikes me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I can't help how it strikes you," broke in Alvin, who did not
intend to accept any commands at this stage of the game. "Mike
goes with us wherever we go."</p>

<p>"I feel the same way," added Chester. "The <em>Deerfoot</em>
can never brave the perils of the deep short-handed. The first
mate is indispensable."</p>

<p>"As you please then. When will you be ready to start?"</p>

<p>"When do you wish us to start?"</p>

<p>"Say to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>"This is so sudden," said Alvin, whose spirits rose at the prospect
of the lively times ahead. "We ought to have a little while to
think it over. However, if my second mate, who generally has views
of his own, will agree, we'll get under way to-morrow after breakfast."</p>

<p>"I'm wid ye, as Mike would say."</p>

<p>"Suppose, Mr. Calvert, we leave it this way: if we decide to
go into this business, we'll make the venture to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"I shall stay at the Squirrel Inn to-night and be on the wharf
a little before nine, on the lookout for you. If you do not show
up then or soon after I shall not expect you. Your boat will be
in plain view all the time, so I shall see you when you start."</p>

<p>"Why not stay with us over night? We shall be glad to have you
do so," was the hospitable invitation of Alvin Landon.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," replied Stockham Calvert, rising to his
feet; "but I came over in a rowboat which is waiting to take me
back. I engaged my room at the inn this afternoon."</p>

<p>He bade them good night and walked briskly down the slope. The
boys stood in front of the bungalow until they heard the sound
of the oars and saw the dim outlines of the boat and its occupants
heading eastward toward the twinkling lights from the inn and
cottages on Squirrel Island.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it all?" asked Alvin of his chum, when after
some minutes they returned to the big sitting room.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to answer you," replied Chester. "It looks
to me as if we are bound to have lively times before we get through
with the business. But, Alvin, all the time that man was talking
I felt a curious distrust of him. He said he is a detective, but
I'm not sure of it."</p>

<p>"Suppose he belongs to the gang that is playing the mischief
with Uncle Sam's post offices in this part of the Union?"</p>

<p>"If that were so, what in the world can he want of you and your
boat?"</p>

<p>"Because of its fleetness it may serve him when he needs it.
However, I don't see that any harm can come to it or to us. He
can't pick up the launch and run away with it and he would find
it hard to do so with us."</p>

<p>"Not forgetting Mike Murphy."</p>

<p>"Then you accept his proposal?"</p>

<p>"Not I, but we together."</p>

<p>"All right; it's a go."</p>
