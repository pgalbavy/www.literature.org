<p>  Through forty foes his path he made,   And safely reached the
forest-glade.   &mdash;<em>SCOTT</em>.</p>

<p>After parting from Hans Vanderbum, the Huron sped noiselessly
through the woods, taking a direction that would lead him to a
point on the river fully three hundred yards below where he had
signaled the German. The stream making a bend there, he would
thus escape the observation of the Shawnees along the bank, at
the point where the fisherman had been engaged in his labors.</p>

<p>So silent, yet rapid, was the motion of Oonomoo, that his figure
flitted through the rifts in the wood like a shadow.  His head
projected slightly forward, in the attitude of acute attention,
and his black, restless eyes constantly flitted from one point
to the other, scarcely resting for a second upon any single object. 
In his left hand he trailed his long rifle, while his right rested
upon the buckhorn handle of the knife in his belt.</p>

<p>He had progressed a considerable distance thus, when the Huron's
gait decreased very rapidly.  He was now in the vicinity of the
river, where he had left his canoe drawn up on the bank.  It was
necessary to reconnoiter thoroughly before venturing to approach
it.  Accordingly, he halted.  The movement of the panther in approaching
his foe was not more stealthy and cautious than was his.</p>

<p>At length, reaching the shelter of a tree, and cautiously peering
around, the Huron caught sight of the stern of his canoe.  One
glance and his dark eyes flashed fire!  The Shawnees had been
there!</p>

<p>What sign caught the notice of Oonomoo?  What kindled the fire
in his dark eye?  What caused one hand to close over his knife,
and the other to grasp his rifle?  It was a sign of his enemy. 
Too well the sagacious Huron knew that the Shawnee was lying in
wait for him.</p>

<p>The canoe, which Oonomoo left behind him, during his interview
with Hans Vanderbum, lay precisely as it was first deposited. 
Not a surrounding limb, shrub or leaf had, so far as he could
see, been disturbed since he left the spot.  And yet the evidence
which presented itself to the eyes of the Indian was as palpable
and unmistakable as would have been the appearance of enemies
themselves.</p>

<p>Oonomoo had carefully drawn his bark canoe up the river-bank
and concealed it as well as the circumstances would admit.  He
had then deposited his long Indian paddle in it, leaving the blade
projecting over the stern.  The paddle <em>was now several inches
further to one side than it had been left by him</em>!</p>

<p>This was the entire evidence.  It was abundantly sufficient to
satisfy the Huron.  He did not doubt for an instant.  His only
uncertainty was in regard to the precise location of his foes. 
A few minutes' observation satisfied him that they were not between
the canoe and the river.  His course of action was accordingly
determined.  It would have been the easiest matter in the world
for him to have escaped by swimming the river; but as an opportunity
for a contest of skill with his enemies was offered, he was too
proud not to embrace it at once. Retreating several rods, he continued
his way upstream in his usual cautious manner, until he had gone
perhaps a furlong above his canoe, when he approached and entered
the stream.</p>

<p>The Miami, at this point, was so heavily wooded, that it was
impossible to pass close under its shore without entering the
water.  Once within this and in a stooping position, a person
would be invisible to any one on the same bank, although he could
be plainly seen from the opposite shore.  Oonomoo now commenced
his descent of the river with the intention of recovering his
canoe.  This was necessarily a tedious and prolonged operation,
as a single misstep, a slip or splash of the water might betray
him to his enemies.  But, he was equal to the task, and never
hesitated for a moment except to listen for some sign of his enemies.</p>

<p>The Shawnees, by the merest accident, had discovered the Huron's
canoe and examined it.  Satisfied that it belonged to none of
their tribe, and most probably had been left there by some hostile
scout, they carefully allowed it to remain as they had found it,
and endeavored to restore everything around to its natural position,
so as not to arouse the suspicion of the owner upon his return. 
This done, they withdrew and awaited with loaded rifles for his
reappearance.  We have shown how a most trifling error in regard
to the paddle placed the Huron on his guard.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a half-hour after Oonomoo had commenced his descent
of the river, that the canoe, without any perceptible jar, slid
an inch or two down the bank.  So quietly and cautiously was this
effected, that, had the Shawnees been looking directly at it,
their suspicion would not have been aroused.</p>

<p>Some ten or fifteen minutes later, the boat moved about the same
distance further.  The expectant Shawnees, clutching their rifles,
were listening anxiously for some sound that might indicate the
approach of their foe, and paid little heed to the canoe itself. 
Ever and anon, it retreated an inch or two down the bank in the
same mysterious manner&mdash;going short distances and so very slowly
that no one but a thoroughly suspicious Indian would have believed
there was any human agency connected with it.</p>

<p>The canoe was fully an hour and a half in moving a single foot,
during which time the Huron managed, by the most consummate skill,
to sustain it in such a manner that the shrubbery and undergrowth
around appeared to occupy relatively the same position that they
did before it had been disturbed.  The river shore was only some
twenty or thirty feet distant, and from where Oonomoo lay, the
way was almost entirely clear to it, so that when he chose to
make any sudden dash or movement, no hindering cause could possibly
offer itself.</p>

<p>One of the Shawnees chanced to glance at the canoe.  At the same
instant, his keen eye detected its changed position, imperceptible
almost as it was.  With a guttural exclamation he arose and moved
toward it, followed by his two companions.  They had taken scarcely
a step, when they saw the boat slide swiftly forward several feet,
and then suddenly rising to the perpendicular position, whisk
off through the bush at a still more rapid rate.  Two twinkling
moccasins, that looked as if they were its support, as they doubled
over each other, fully explained to the Shawnees the cause of
this singular scene.</p>

<p>With a loud yell, the three dashed forward, while the Huron ran
at the top of his speed over the slight distance that lay between
him and the river.  Reaching the shore, he changed the canoe from
his rear to his front, and holding it like a shield above and
before him.  With one foot in the edge of the water, he concentrated
all his strength for the effort and leaped far out in the stream&mdash;the
canoe falling with a loud splash perfectly flat upon the surface. 
The impetus thus given caused it to shoot like an arrow for a
long distance, when the Huron, inclining his body to the left,
careened it so much, that his own person was concealed from any
who might be upon the shore, while, by reaching his hand over
into the current, he was enabled to use it as a paddle, and continue
his onward motion.</p>

<p>Oonomoo was fully aware that the delicate structure of the canoe
was no obstruction at all against a rifle-shot.  Accordingly,
while descending the river, he had taken precaution to insure
his safety, in case of such an occurrence as had now transpired. 
A large, rotten limb, hardly the length of his own body, was carried
with him.  At the moment of lifting the canoe from the ground,
the limb was placed within it, and thus was carried back to the
edge of the river.  Lying flat upon his face, this limb was about
the thickness of the Huron's waist, and by skillfully balancing
the boat, it was interposed directly between him and his foes. 
The only parts of his person which possibly could be struck were
his feet and the arm stretched over the side of the canoe. The
former necessarily being in the stern, it was hardly probable
that they would be wounded.  There was such risk of the arm that
Oonomoo drew it within the boat for a few moments.  He had scarcely
done so, when the reports of two rifles, and the peculiar zip
of the bullets as they cut through the side of the canoe and buried
themselves in the rotten wood, proved how wise was the precaution
he had taken.</p>

<p>Quick as thought, the hand of the Huron was in the water again,
where, as he vigorously used it, it flashed like some fish at
play.  The Shawnees, who plainly discerned the two holes their
bullets had made, could scarcely believe their daring foe had
escaped injury.  But they were forced to believe he was still
living from the fact that the canoe steadily progressed across
and was not carried down-stream by the current.  The whoop of
the Shawnees had been heard by their comrades further down the
bank.  As the canoe reached the middle of the river, they caught
a sight of it, and readily conjectured the true state of the case. 
In a twinkling, two of their own were launched in pursuit. Discovering
this, Oonomoo arose to the upright position, and dipping his paddle
deep in the water, sent his boat forward with astonishing swiftness. 
As it lightly touched the bank, he leaped ashore and pulled it
up after him.  Then uttering a defiant yell, he turned, and to
show the scorn in which he held the Shawnees, walked slowly and
deliberately into the forest.  Once fairly beyond their sight,
however, his pace quickened, and when the sun sunk low in the
western horizon, he was many a mile from the Miami.</p>
