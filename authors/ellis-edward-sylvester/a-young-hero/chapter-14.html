<p>Fred Sheldon sprang up from his hiding-place in the grass, almost
before the drover vaulted over the fence, and ran across the meadow
in the manner he did when he believed the wandering lion was at
his heels.</p>

<p>Cyrus Sutton seemed to be confused for the minute, as though
he had scared up some strange sort of animal, and he stared until
the dark figure began to grow dim in the distance.</p>

<p>Even then he might not have said or done anything had not Bud
Heyland heard the noise and come clambering over the fence after
him.</p>

<p>"Why don't you shoot him?" demanded Bud; "he's a spy that has
been listening! Let's capture him! Come on! It will never do for
him to get away! If we can't overhaul him, we can shoot him on
the fly!"</p>

<p>The impetuous Bud struck across the lot much the same as a frightened
ox would have done when galloping. He was in dead earnest, for
he and Sutton had been discussing some important schemes, which
it would not do for outsiders to learn anything about.</p>

<p>He held his pistol in hand, and was resolved that the spy should
not escape him. The skurrying figure was dimly visible in the
moonlight, but in his haste and excitement Bud probably did not
observe that the object of the chase was of very short stature.</p>

<p>Sutton kept close beside Bud, occasionally falling a little behind,
as though it was hard work.</p>

<p>"He's running as fast as we," said Sutton; "you had better hail
him."</p>

<p>Bud Heyland did so on the instant.</p>

<p>"Hold on there! Stop! Surrender and you will be spared! If you
don't stop I'll shoot!"</p>

<p>Master Frederick Sheldon believed he was running for life, and,
finding he was not overtaken, he redoubled his exertions, his
chubby legs carrying him along with a speed which astonished even
himself.</p>

<p>The terrible hail of his pursuer instead of "bringing him to,"
therefore, only spurred him to greater exertions.</p>

<p>"I give you warning," called out Bud, beginning to pant from
the severity of his exertion, "that I'll shoot, and when I take
aim I'm always sure to hit something."</p>

<p>"That's what makes me so afraid," said Sutton, dropping a little
behind, "for I think I'm in more danger than the one ahead."</p>

<p>Bud Heyland now raised his revolver and sighted as well as he
could at the shadowy figure, which was beginning to edge off to
the left. A person on a full run is not certain to make a good
shot, and when the weapon was discharged, the bullet missed the
fugitive by at least a dozen feet if not more.</p>

<p>Bud lowered the pistol and looked to see the daring intruder
fall to the ground, but he did not do so, and continued on at
the same surprising gait.</p>

<p>"That bullet grazed him," said Bud, bringing up his pistol again;
"just see how I'll make him drop this time; fix your eye on him,
and when I pull the trigger he'll give a yell and jump right up
in the air."</p>

<p>To make his aim sure, beyond all possibility of failure, the
panting pursuer came to a halt for a moment, and resting the barrel
on his left arm, as though he were a duelist, he took "dead aim"
at the lad and again pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>But there is no reason to believe that he came any nearer the
mark than in the former instance; and when Sutton said with a
laugh:</p>

<p>"I don't see him jump and yell, Bud," the marksman, retorted:</p>

<p>"You'd better shoot yourself, then."</p>

<p>"No; I was afraid you would shoot me instead of him. I think
you came nearer me than you did him. Hark! Did you hear the man
laugh then. He don't mind us so long as we keep shooting at him."</p>

<p>"Did he laugh?" demanded Bud, savagely. "If he laughed at me
he shall die!"</p>

<p>Hurriedly replacing his useless pistol in his pocket he resumed
his pursuit with fierce energy, for he was resolved on overhauling
the man who had dared to listen to what had been said.</p>

<p>Had Bud been alone he would have left the pursuit to some one
else, but with the muscular Cyrus Sutton at his back he was running
over with courage and vengeance.</p>

<p>Although the halt had been a brief one, yet it could not fail
to prove of advantage to the fugitive, who was speeding with might
and main across the meadow, and had begun to work off to the left,
because he was anxious to reach the shelter of some woods, where
he was hopeful of dodging his pursuers.</p>

<p>It would seem that Bud Heyland and Cyrus Sutton could easily
outspeed such a small boy as Fred Sheldon, but they were so bulky
that it was much harder work for them to run, and they could not
last so long.</p>

<p>Hitherto they had lumbered along pretty heavily, but now they
settled down to work with all the vigor they possessed, realizing
that it was useless to expect to capture the fugitive in any other
way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fred Sheldon was doing his "level best;" active and
quick in his movements he could run rapidly for one of his years,
and could keep it up much longer than those behind him, though
for a short distance their speed was the greater.</p>

<p>Dreading, as he did, to fall into the hands of Bud Heyland and
his lawless companion, he put forth all the power at his command,
and glancing over his shoulder now and then he kept up his flight
with an energy that taxed his strength and endurance to the utmost.</p>

<p>When he found that they were not gaining on him he was encouraged,
but greatly frightened by the pistol-shots. He was sure that one
of the bullets went through his hat and the other grazed his ear,
but so long as they didn't disable him he meant to keep going.</p>

<p>He was nearly across the meadow when he recalled that he was
speeding directly toward a worm-fence which separated it from
the adjoining field. It would take a few precious seconds to surmount
that, and he turned diagonally toward the left, as has been stated,
because by taking such a course, he could reach the edge of a
small stretch of woods, in whose shadows he hoped to secure shelter
from his would-be captors.</p>

<p>This change in the line of flight could not fail to operate to
the disadvantage of the fugitive, for a time at least, for, being
understood by Bud and Cyrus, they swerved still more, and sped
along with increased speed, so that they rapidly recovered the
ground lost a short time before.</p>

<p>They were aiming to cut off Fred, who saw his danger at once,
and changed his course to what might be called "straight away"
again, throwing his pursuers directly behind him.</p>

<p>This checked the scheme for the time, but it deprived Fred of
his great hope of going over the fence directly into the darkness
of the woods.</p>

<p>As it was, he was now speeding toward the high worm-fence which
separated the field he was in from the one adjoining.</p>

<p>Already he could see the long, crooked line of rails, as they
stretched out to the right and left in front of him, disappearing
in the gloom and looking like mingling lines of India ink against
the sky beyond.</p>

<p>Even in such stirring moments odd thoughts come to us, and Fred,
while on the dead run, compared in his mind the fence rails to
the crooked and erratic lines he had drawn with his pen on a sheet
of white paper.</p>

<p>Although he could leap higher in the air and further on the level
than any lad of his age, he knew better than to try and vault
such a fence. As he approached it, therefore, he slackened his
gait slightly, and springing upward with one foot on the middle
rail, he placed the other instantly after on the topmost one and
went over like a greyhound, with scarcely any hesitation, continuing
his flight, and once more swerving to the left toward the woods
on which he now fixed his hopes.</p>

<p>Possibly Bud Heyland thought that the fact of his being attached
to Colonel Bandman's great menagerie and circus called upon him
to perform greater athletic feats; for instead of imitating the
more prudent course of the fugitive, he made a tremendous effort
to clear the fence with one bound.</p>

<p>He would have succeeded but for the top three rails. As it was
his rather large feet struck them, and he went over with a crash,
his hat flying off and his head ploughing quite a furrow in the
ground.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Bud Heyland fell headlong over the fence in pursuit
of Fred. &mdash;(See page 151.)]</p>

<p>He rolled over several times, and as he picked himself up it
seemed as if most of his bones were broken and he never had been
so jarred in all his life.</p>

<p>"Did you fall?" asked Cyrus Sutton, unable to suppress his laughter,
as he climbed hastily after him.</p>

<p>"I tripped a little," was the angry reply, "and I don't see anything
to laugh at; come on! we'll have him yet!"</p>

<p>To the astonishment of the cattle dealer, Bud caught up his hat
and resumed the pursuit with only a moment's delay, and limping
only slightly from his severe shaking up.</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon was dimly visible making for the woods, and the
two followed, Sutton just a little behind his friend.</p>

<p>"You might as well give it up," said the elder; "he's got too
much of a start and is making for cover."</p>

<p>"I'm bound to have him before he can reach it, and I'll pay him
for all this."</p>

<p>No more than one hundred feet separated the parties, when Fred,
beginning to feel the effects of his severe exertion, darted in
among the shadows of the wood, and, hardly knowing what was the
best to do, threw himself flat on the ground, behind the trunk
of a large tree, where he lay panting and afraid the loud throbbing
of his heart would betray him to his pursuers, who were so close
behind him.</p>

<p>Had he been given a single minute more he would have made a sharp
turn in his course, and thus could have thrown them off the track
without difficulty; but, as it was&mdash;we shall see.</p>

<p>Bud Heyland rushed by within a few feet, and halted a couple
of yards beyond, while Sutton stopped within a third of that distance,
where Fred lay flat on the ground.</p>

<p>"Do you hear him?" asked Bud.</p>

<p>"Hear him? No; he's given us the slip, and it's all time thrown
away to hunt further for him."</p>

<p>Bud uttered an angry exclamation and stood a few minutes listening
for some sound that would tell where the eavesdropper was.</p>

<p>But nothing was heard, and Sutton moved forward, passing so close
to Fred that the latter could have reached out his hand and touched
him.</p>

<p>"How could he help seeing me?" the boy asked himself, as the
man joined Bud Heyland, and the two turned off and moved in the
direction of the highway.</p>

<p>Some distance away Bud Heyland and Sutton stopped and talked
together in such low tones that Fred Sheldon could only hear the
murmur of their voices, as he did when he first learned of their
presence beside the road.</p>

<p>But it is, perhaps, needless to say that he was content to let
them hold their conference in peace, without any effort on his
part to overhear any more of it. He was only too glad to let them
alone, and to indulge a hope that they would be equally considerate
toward him.</p>

<p>Bud would have continued the search much longer and with a strong
probability of success had not Sutton persuaded him that it was
only a waste of time to do so. Accordingly they resumed their
walk, with many expressions of impatience over their failure to
capture the individual who dared to discover their secrets in
such an underhanded way.</p>

<p>"He looked to me like a very small man," said Bud, as he walked
slowly along, dusting the dirt from his clothing and rubbing the
many bruised portions of his body.</p>

<p>"Of course he was," replied Sutton, "or he wouldn't have gone
into that kind of business."</p>

<p>"I don't mean that; he seemed like a short man."</p>

<p>"Yes, so he was, but there are plenty of full-grown men in this
world who are no taller than he."</p>

<p>"It's too bad, I broke my pipe all to pieces when I fell over
the fence, and jammed the stem half way down my throat."</p>

<p>"I thought you had broken your neck," said Sutton, "and you ought
to be thankful that you did not."</p>

<p>Bud muttered an ill-natured reply, and the two soon after debouched
into the highway, along which they continued until the house of
the younger was reached, where they stopped a minute or so for
a few more words, when they separated for the night.</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon waited until they were far beyond sight and hearing,
when he cautiously rose to his feet and stood for a short time
to make sure he could leave the spot without detection.</p>

<p>"I guess I've had enough for one night," he said with a sigh,
as he turned off across the meadow until he reached the border
of the lane, along which he walked until he knocked at the door
of the Misses Perkinpine, where he was admitted with the same
cordiality that was always shown him.</p>

<p>They seemed to think he had stayed at the hired man's house for
a chat with Bud, and made no inquiries, while the boy himself
did not deem it best to tell what had befallen him.</p>

<p>His recent experience had been so severe upon him that he felt
hungry enough to eat another supper, and he would not have required
a second invitation to do so, but, as the first was not given,
he concluded to deny himself for the once.</p>

<p>Fred expected to lie awake a long time after going to bed, trying
to solve the meaning of the few significant words he had overheard,
but he fell asleep almost immediately, and did not wake until
called by Aunt Lizzie.</p>

<p>This was Friday, the last school-day of the week, and he made
sure of being on hand in time. As he had been absent by the permission
of his mother, made known through a note sent before she went
to see her brother, Mr. McCurtis could not take him to task for
his failure to attend school, but a number of lads who had been
tempted away by the circus and the excitement over the escaped
lion were punished severely.</p>

<p>However, they absented themselves with a full knowledge of what
would follow, and took the bitter dregs with the sweet, content
to have the pain if they might first have the pleasure.</p>

<p>"I have excused several of you," said the teacher, peering very
keenly through his glasses at Fred, "for absence, but I have not
been asked to excuse any failure in lessons, and I do not intend
to do so. Those who have been loitering and wasting their time
will soon make it appear when called on to recite, and they must
be prepared for the consequences."</p>

<p>This remark was intended especially for Fred, who was thankful
that he found out what the lessons of the day were, for he had
prepared himself perfectly.</p>

<p>And it was well he did so, for the teacher seemed determined
to puzzle him. Fred was asked every sort of question the lesson
could suggest. It had always been said by Mrs. Sheldon that Fred
never knew a lesson so long as he failed to see clear through
it, and could answer any question germane to it.</p>

<p>He felt the wisdom of such instruction on this occasion, when
the teacher at the end of the examination allowed him to take
his seat and remarked, half angrily:</p>

<p>"There's a boy who knows his lessons, which is more than I can
say of a good many of you. I think it will be a good thing for
him to go out and hunt a few more lions."</p>

<p>This was intended as a witticism on the part of the teacher,
and, like the urchins of Goldsmith's "Deserted Village," they
all laughed with "counterfeit glee," some of the boys roaring
as if they would fall off the benches from the excess of their
mirth.</p>

<p>Mr. McCurtis smiled grimly, and felt it was another proof that
when he became a school teacher the world lost one of its greatest
comedians and wits.</p>

<p>At recess and noon Fred was quite a hero among the scholars.
They gathered about him and he had to tell the story over and
over again, as well as the dreadful feelings that must have been
his when he woke up in the night and found that a real, live burglar
was in his room.</p>

<p>Like most boys of his age, Fred unconsciously exaggerated in
telling the narratives so often, but he certainly deserved credit,
not only for his genuine bravery, but for the self-restraint that
enabled him to keep back some other things he might have related
which would have raised him still more in the admiration of his
young friends.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell them to mother first of all," was his conclusion,
"and I will take her advice as to what I should do."</p>

<p>He brought the lunch the Misses Perkinpine had put up for him,
and stayed in the neighborhood of the school-house all noon, with
a number of others, who lived some distance away. As the weather
was quite warm, the boys sat under a tree, talking over the stirring
incidents of the preceding few days.</p>

<p>Fred was answering a question for the twentieth time, when he
was alarmed by the sudden appearance of Bud Heyland, with his
trousers tucked in his boots, his briar-wood pipe&mdash;that is, a
new one&mdash;in his mouth, and his blacksnake-whip in hand.</p>

<p>As he walked along he looked at the school-house very narrowly,
almost coming to a full stop, and acting as though he was searching
for some one. He did not observe that half a dozen boys were stretched
out in the shadow of the big tree across the road.</p>

<p>"Keep still!" said Fred, in a whisper, "and maybe he won't see
us."</p>

<p>But young Heyland was not to be misled so easily. Observing that
the school was dismissed, he looked all around him, and quickly
espied the little fellows lolling in the shade, when he immediately
walked over toward them.</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon's heart was in his mouth on the instant, for he
was sure Bud was looking for him.</p>

<p>"He must have known me last night," he thought, "and as he couldn't
catch me then he has come to pay me off now."</p>

<p>But it would have been a confession of guilt to start and run,
and Bud would be certain to overtake him before he could go far,
so the boy did not stir from the ground on which he was reclining.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Bud," called out several, as he approached. "How are
you getting along?"</p>

<p>"None of your business," was the characteristic answer; "is Fred
Sheldon there?"</p>

<p>"I'm here," said Fred, rising to the sitting position. "What
do you want of me?"</p>

<p>Bud Heyland acted curiously. He looked sharply at the boy, and
then said:</p>

<p>"I don't want anything of you just now, but I'll see you later,"
and without anything further he moved on, leaving our hero wondering
why he had not asked for the ten dollars due him.</p>

<p>Fred expected he would return, and was greatly relieved when
the teacher appeared and school was called. Fearful that the bully
would wait for him on the road, Fred went to the old brick mansion
first, where he stayed till dark, when he decided to run over
to his own home, look after matters there, and then return by
a new route to the old ladies who were so kind to him.</p>

<p>He kept a sharp lookout on the road, but saw nothing of either
Bud or Cyrus Sutton.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Fred to himself, as he approached the
old familiar spot, "that I ought to hear something from mother
by this time. There isn't any school to-morrow, and I'll walk
over to Uncle Will's and find out when she's coming home, and
then I'll tell her all I've got to tell, which is so much, with
what I want to ask, that it'll take me a week to get through&mdash;halloo!
What does that mean?"</p>

<p>He stopped short in the road, for through the closed blinds of
the lower story he caught the twinkling rays of a light that some
one had started within.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether it is our house they're going to rob to-night,"
exclaimed Fred, adding the next moment, with a grim humor: "If
it is, they will be more disappointed than they ever were in their
lives."</p>

<p>A minute's thought satisfied him that no one with a view to robbery
was there, for the good reason that there was nothing to steal,
as anyone would be quick to learn.</p>

<p>"It must be some tramp prowling around in the hope of getting
something to eat. Anyway, I will soon find out&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then the window was raised, the shutters thrown wide open
by some person, who leaned part way out the window in full view.</p>

<p>One glance was enough for Fred Sheldon to recognize that face
and form, the dearest on earth, as seen in the starlight, with
the yellow rays of the lamp behind them.</p>

<p>"Halloo, mother! Ain't I glad to see you? How are you? Bless
your dear soul! What made you stay away so long?"</p>

<p>"Fred, my own boy!"</p>

<p>And leaning out the window she threw both arms about the neck
of the lad, who in turn threw his about her, just as the two always
did when they met after a brief separation.</p>

<p>The fact of it was, Fred Sheldon was in love with his mother
and always had been, and that sort of boy is sure to make his
mark in this world.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the happy boy had entered the house and was
sitting at the tea table, eating very little and talking very
much.</p>

<p>The mother told him that his uncle had been dangerously ill,
but had begun to mend that day, and was now believed to have passed
the crisis of his fever, and would soon get well. She therefore
expected to stay with her boy all the time.</p>

<p>And then the delighted little fellow began his story, or rather
series of stories, while the kind eyes of the handsome and proud
parent were fixed on the boy with an interest which could not
have been stronger.</p>

<p>Her face paled when, in his own graphic way, he pictured his
lonely watch in the old brick mansion, and the dreadful discovery
that the wicked tramp had entered the building stealthily behind
him. She shuddered to think that her loved one had been so imperiled,
and was thankful indeed that Providence had protected him.</p>

<p>Then the story of the lion, of its unexpected breaking out from
the cage, the panic of the audience, his encounter with it in
the lane, its entry into the smoke-house, his shutting the door,
and finally how he earned and received the reward. All this was
told with a childish simplicity and truthfulness which would have
thrilled any one who had a less personal interest than the boy's
mother.</p>

<p>As I have said, there were no secrets that the son kept from
his parent. He told how he saw that the tramp wore false whiskers
and how he dropped a knife on the floor, which he got and showed
to his mother, explaining to her at the same time that the letters
were the initials of the young man known through the neighborhood
as "Bud" Heyland.</p>

<p>"That may all be," said she, smilingly, "and yet Bud may be as
innocent as you or I."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Fred, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"He may have traded or lost the knife, or some one may have stolen
it and left it there on purpose to turn suspicion toward Bud.
Such things have been done many a time, and it is odd that anyone
could drop a knife in such a place without knowing it."</p>

<p>Fred opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Then Bud is innocent, you think?"</p>

<p>"No, I believe he is guilty, for you say you were pretty sure
of his voice, but it won't do to be too certain. As to the other
man, who misled you when you met him in the lane, it is a hard
thing to say who he is."</p>

<p>"Why, mother, I'm surer of him than I am of Bud, and I'm dead
sure of him, you know."</p>

<p>"What are your reasons?"</p>

<p>Fred gave them as they are already known to the reader. The wise
little woman listened attentively, and said when he had finished:</p>

<p>"I don't wonder that you think as you do, but you once was as
sure, as I understand, of Mr. Kincade, the one who paid you the
reward."</p>

<p>"That is so," assented Fred, "but I hadn't had so much time to
think over the whole matter."</p>

<p>"Very probably you are right, for they are intimate, and they
are staying in the neighborhood for no good. Tell me just what
you heard them say last night, when they sat on the rock by the
roadside. Be careful not to put in any words of your own, but
give only precisely what you know were spoken by the two."</p>

<p>The boy did as requested, the mother now and then asking a question
and keeping him down close to the task of telling only the plain,
simple truth, concerning which there was so much of interest to
both.</p>

<p>When he was through she said the words of the two showed that
some wicked scheme was in contemplation, though nothing had been
heard to indicate its precise nature.</p>

<p>The matter having been fully told the question remained&mdash;and
it was the great one which underlay all others&mdash;what could Fred
do to earn the large reward offered by the two ladies who had
lost their property?</p>

<p>"Remember," said his mother, thoughtfully, "you are only a small
boy fourteen years old, and it is not reasonable to think you
can out-general two bad persons who have learned to be cunning
in all they do."</p>

<p>"Nor was it reasonable to think I would out-general a big lion,"
said Fred, with a laugh, as he leaned on his mother's lap and
looked up in her eyes.</p>

<p>"No; but that lion was old and harmless; he might have spent
the remainder of his days in this neighborhood without any one
being in danger."</p>

<p>"But we didn't know that."</p>

<p>"But you know that Bud Heyland and this Mr. Sutton are much older
than you and are experienced in evil doing."</p>

<p>"So was the lion," ventured Fred, slyly, quite hopeful of earning
the prize on which he had set his heart. "I have been thinking
that maybe I ought to tell Mr. Jackson, the constable, about the
knife, with Bud's name on it."</p>

<p>"No," said the mother. "It isn't best to tell him anything, for
he has little discretion. He boasts too much about what he is
going to do; the wise and skilful man never does that."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheldon had "gauged" the fussy little constable accurately
when she thus described him.</p>

<p>"Fred," suddenly said his mother, "do not the Misses Perkinpine
expect you to stay at their house to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I told them I would be back, and they will be greatly surprised,
for I didn't say anything about your coming home, because I thought
Uncle Will was so sick you wouldn't be able to leave him."</p>

<p>"Then you had better run over and explain why it is you cannot
stay with them to-night."</p>

<p>The affectionate boy disliked to leave his mother when they were
holding such a pleasant conversation, but he could please her
only by doing so, and donning his broad-brimmed straw hat, and
bidding her good-night, passed out the door, promising soon to
return.</p>

<p>Fred was so anxious to spend the evening at home that he broke
into a trot the instant he passed out the gate, and kept it up
along the highway until he reached the short lane, which was so
familiar to him.</p>

<p>The same eagerness to return caused him to forget one fact that
had hitherto impressed him, which was that the conspiracy of Bud
Heyland and Cyrus Sutton was intended to be carried out this same
evening.</p>

<p>The boy had gone almost the length of the lane when he was surprised
to observe a point of light moving about in the shadow of the
trees, the night being darker than the previous one.</p>

<p>"What under the sun can that be?" he asked, stopping short and
scrutinizing it with an interest that may be imagined.</p>

<p>Viewed from where he stood, it looked like a jack-o'-lantern,
or a candle which some one held in his hand while moving about.</p>

<p>It had that swaying, up-and-down motion, such as a person makes
when walking rapidly, while now and then it shot up a little higher,
as though the bearer had raised it over his head to get a better
view of his surroundings.</p>

<p>"Well, that beats everything I ever heard of," muttered Fred,
resuming his walk toward the house; "it must be some kind of a
lantern, and maybe it's one of them dark ones which robbers use,
and they are taking a look at the outside to see which is the
best way of getting inside, though I don't think there is anything
left for them."</p>

<p>The distance to the house was so short that Fred soon reached
the yard. On his way thither the strange light vanished several
times, only to reappear again, its occasional eclipse, no doubt,
being due to the intervening vegetation.</p>

<p>When the boy came closer he saw that the lantern was held in
the hand of Aunt Lizzie, who was walking slowly around the yard,
with her sister by her side, while they peered here and there
with great deliberation and care.</p>

<p>"Why, Aunt Lizzie!" called out Fred, as he came up, "what are
you looking for?"</p>

<p>The good ladies turned toward him with a faint gasp of fright,
and then gave utterance to an expression of thankfulness.</p>

<p>"Why, Frederick, we are looking for you," was the reply, and
then, complimenting his truthfulness, she added, "you promised
to come back, and we knew you wouldn't tell a story, and sister
and I thought maybe you were hungry and sick somewhere around
the yard, and if so we were going to get you into the house and
give you some supper."</p>

<p>"Why, aunties, I've had supper," laughed Fred, amused beyond
measure at the simplicity of the good ladies.</p>

<p>"We didn't suppose that made any difference," was the kind remark
