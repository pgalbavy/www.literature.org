<p>I don't suppose there is any use in trying to find out when the
game of "Jack Stones" was first played. No one can tell. It certainly
is a good many hundred years old.</p>

<p>All boys and girls know how to play it. There is the little rubber
ball, which you toss in the air, catch up one of the odd iron
prongs, without touching another, and while the ball is aloft;
then you do the same with another, and again with another, until
none is left. After that you seize a couple at a time, until all
have been used; then three, and four, and so on, with other variations,
to the end of the game.</p>

<p>Doubtless your fathers and mothers, if they watch you during
the progress of the play, will think it easy and simple. If they
do, persuade them to try it. You will soon laugh at their failure.</p>

<p>Now, when we older folks were young like you, we did not have
the regular, scraggly bits of iron and dainty rubber ball. We
played with pieces of stones. I suspect more deftness was needed
in handling them than in using the new fashioned pieces. Certainly,
in trials than I can remember, I never played the game through
without a break; but then I was never half so handy as you are
at such things: that, no doubt, accounts for it.</p>

<p>Well, a good many years ago, before any of your fathers or mothers
were born, a little girl named Alice Ripley sat near her home
playing "Jack Stones." It was the first of July, 1778, and although
her house was made of logs, had no carpets or stove, but a big
fireplace, where all the food was made ready for eating, yet no
sweeter or happier girl can be found today, if you spend weeks
in searching for her. Nor can you come upon a more lovely spot
in which to build a home, for it was the famed Wyoming Valley,
in Western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Now, since some of my young friends may not be acquainted with
this place, you will allow me to tell you that the Wyoming Valley
lies between the Blue Ridge and the Alleghany Mountains, and that
the beautiful Susquehanna River runs through it.</p>

<p>The valley runs northeast and southwest, and is twenty-one miles
long, with an average breadth of three miles. The bottom lands&mdash;that
is, those in the lowest portion&mdash;are sometimes overflowed when
there is an unusual quantity of water in the river. In some places
the plains are level, and in others, rolling. The soil is very
fertile.</p>

<p>Two mountain ranges hem in the valley. The one on the east has
an average height of a thousand feet, and the other two hundred
feet less. The eastern range is steep, mostly barren, and abounds
with caverns, clefts, ravines, and forests. The western is not
nearly so wild, and is mostly cultivated.</p>

<p>The meaning of the Indian word for Wyoming is "Large Plains,"
which, like most of the Indian names, fits very well indeed.</p>

<p>The first white man who visited Wyoming was a good Moravian missionary,
Count Zinzendorf&mdash;in 1742. He toiled among the Delaware Indians
who lived there, and those of his faith who followed him were
the means of the conversion of a great many red men.</p>

<p>The fierce warriors became humble Christians, who set the best
example to wild brethren, and often to the wicked white men.</p>

<p>More than twenty years before the Revolution settlers began making
their way into the Wyoming Valley. You would think their only
trouble would be with the Indians, who always look with anger
upon intruders of that kind, but really their chief difficulty
was with white people.</p>

<p>Most of these pioneers came from Connecticut. The successors
of William Penn, who had bought Pennsylvania from his king, and
then again from the Indians, did not fancy having settlers from
other colonies take possession of one of the garden spots of his
grant.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you about the quarrels between the settlers from
Connecticut and those that were already living in Pennsylvania.
Forty of the invaders, as they may be called, put up a fort, which
was named on that account Forty Fort. This was in the winter of
1769, and two hundred more pioneers followed them in the spring.
The fort stood on the western bank of the river.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvanians, however, had prepared for them, and the trouble
began. During the few years following, the New Englanders were
three times driven out of the valley, and the men, women, and
children were obliged to tramp for two hundred miles through the
unbroken wilderness to their old homes. But they rallied and came
back again, and at last were strong enough to hold their ground.
About this time the mutterings of the American Revolution began
to be heard, and the Pennsylvanians and New Englanders forgot
their enmity and became brothers in their struggle for independence.</p>

<p>Among the pioneers from Connecticut who put up their old fashioned
log houses in Wyoming were George Ripley and his wife Ruth. They
were young, frugal, industrious, and worthy people. They had but
one child&mdash;a boy named Benjamin; but after awhile Alice was added
to the family, and at the date of which I am telling you she was
six years and her brother thirteen years old.</p>

<p>Mr. Ripley was absent with the continental army under General
Washington, fighting the battles of his country. Benjamin, on
this spring day, was visiting some of his friends further down
the valley; so that when Alice came forth to play "Jack Stones"
alone, no one was in sight, though her next neighbor lived hardly
two hundred yards away.</p>

<p>I wish you could have seen her as she looked on that summer afternoon.
She had been helping, so far as she was able, her mother in the
house, until the parent told her to go outdoors and amuse herself.
She was chubby, plump, healthy, with round pink cheeks, yellow
hair tied in a coil at the back of her head, and her big eyes
were as blue, and clear, and bright as they could be.</p>

<p>She wore a brown homespun dress&mdash;that is to say, the materials
had been woven by the deft fingers of her mother, with the aid
of the old spinning wheel, which in those days formed a part of
every household. The dark stockings were knitted by the same busy
fingers, with the help of the flashing needles; and the shoes,
put together by Peleg Quintin, the humpbacked shoemaker, were
heavy and coarse, and did not fit any too well.</p>

<p>The few simple articles of underwear were all homemade, clean,
and comfortable, and the same could be said of the clothing of
the brother and of the mother herself.</p>

<p>Alice came running out of the open front door, bounding off the
big flat stone which served as a step with a single leap, and,
running to a spot of green grass a few yards away, where there
was not a bit of dirt or a speck of dust, she sat down and began
the game of which I told you at the opening of this story.</p>

<p>Alice was left handed. So when she took position, she leaned
over to the right, supporting her body with that arm, while with
the other hand she tossed the little jagged pieces of stone aloft,
snatching up the others, and letting the one that was going up
and down in the air drop into her chubby palm.</p>

<p>She had been playing perhaps ten minutes, when she found someone
was watching her.</p>

<p>She did not see him at first, but heard a low, deep "Huh!" partly
at one side and partly behind her.</p>

<p>Instead of glancing around, she finished the turn of the game
on which she was engaged just then. That done, she clasped all
the Jack Stones in her hand, assumed the upright posture, and
looked behind her.</p>

<p>"I thought it was you, Omas," she said with a merry laugh; "do
you want to play Jack Stones with me?"</p>

<p>If you could have seen the person whom she thus addressed, you
would have thought it a strange way of speaking.</p>

<p>He was an Indian warrior, belonging to the tribe of Delawares.
Those who knew about him said he was one of the fiercest red men
that ever went on the warpath. A few years before, there had been
a massacre of the settlers, and Omas was foremost among the Indians
who swung the tomahawk and fired his rifle at the white people.</p>

<p>He was tall, sinewy, active, and powerful. Three stained eagle
feathers were fastened on his crown in the long black hair, and
his hunting shirt, leggings, and moccasins were bright with different
colored beads and fringes. In the red sash which passed around
his waist were thrust a hunting knife and tomahawk, while one
hand clasped a cumbersome rifle, which, like all firearms of those
times, was used with ramrod and flintlock.</p>

<p>Omas would have had a rather pleasing face had he let it alone;
but his people love bright colors, and he was never seen without
a lot of paint daubed over it. This was made up of black, white,
and yellow circles, lines, and streaks that made him look frightful.</p>

<p>But Alice was not scared at all. She and Omas were old friends.
Nearly a year before, he stopped at their cabin one stormy night
and asked for something to eat. Mrs. Ripley gave him plenty of
coarse brown, well baked bread and cold meat, and allowed him
to sleep on the floor until morning.</p>

<p>Benjamin was rather shy of the fierce looking Delaware, but Alice
took to him at first. She brought him a basin of water, and asked
him to please wash his face.</p>

<p>The startled mother gently reproved her; but Omas did that which
an Indian rarely does&mdash;smiled. He spoke English unusually well,
and knew why the child had proposed to him to use the water.</p>

<p>He told her that he had a little girl that he called Linna, about
the same age as Alice. Upon hearing this, what did Alice do, but
climb upon the warrior's knee and ask him to tell her all about
Linna. Well, the result was, that an affection was formed between
this wild warrior and the gentle little girl.</p>

<p>Omas promised to bring his child to see Alice, who, with her
mother's permission, said she would return the visit. There can
be no doubt that the Delaware often went a long way out of his
course, for no other reason than to spend an hour or less with
Alice Ripley. The brother and mother always made him feel welcome,
and to the good parent the influence of her child upon the savage
red man had a peculiar interest which nothing else in the world
could possess for her. So you understand why it was that Alice
did not start and show any fear when she looked around and saw
the warrior standing less than ten feet off, and attentively watching
her.</p>

<p>"You can't play Jack Stones as well as I," she said, looking
saucily up at him.</p>

<p>"I beat you," was his reply, as he strode forward and sat down
cross legged on the grass.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see you do it! You think you're very smart, don't
you?"</p>

<p>A shadowy smile played around the stern mouth, and the Delaware,
who had studied the simple game long enough to understand it,
began the sport under the observant eyes of his little mistress.</p>

<p>While both were intent on the amusement, Mrs. Ripley came to
the door and stood wonderingly looking at them.</p>

<p>"It does seem as if Indians are human beings like the rest of
us," was her thought; "but who could resist her gentle ways?"</p>

<p>Up went the single stone in the air, and Omas grabbed the batch
that were lying on the ground, and then caught the first as it
came down.</p>

<p>"That won't do!" called Alice, seizing the brawny hand, which&mdash;sad
to say&mdash;had been stained with blood as innocent as hers; "you
didn't do that fair!"</p>

<p>"What de matter?" he asked, looking reproachfully into the round
face almost against his own.</p>

<p>"I'll show you how. Now, I lay those three on the ground like
that. Then I toss up this, pick up one without touching any of
the others, keep it in my hand and pick up the next&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>She illustrated her instruction by her work, while her pupil
listened and stared.</p>

<p>"I know &mdash;I know," he said quickly. "I show you." Then the
wag of a Delaware tossed the first stone fully twenty feet aloft,
caught up the others, and took that on the fly.</p>

<p>"I never saw anybody as dumb as you," was the comment. "What
is the use of your trying? You couldn't learn to play Jack Stones
in ever so long."</p>

<p>She was about to try him again, when, childlike, she darted off
upon a widely different subject, for it had just come into her
little head.</p>

<p>"Omas, when you were here the other day, you promised that the
next time you came to see me you would bring Linna."</p>

<p>"Dat so &mdash;Omas promise."</p>

<p>"Then why haven't you done as you said?"</p>

<p>"Omas never speak with double tongue; he bring Linna with him."</p>

<p>"You did?&mdash;where is she?" asked Alice, springing to her feet,
clasping her hands, and looking expectantly around.</p>

<p>The Delaware emitted a shrill, tremulous whistle, and immediately
from the wood several rods behind them came running the oddest
looking little girl anyone could have met in a long time.</p>

<p>Her face was as round as that of Alice, her long, black hair
hung loosely over her shoulders, her small eyes were as black
as jet, her nose a pug, her teeth as white and regular as were
ever seen, while her dress was a rude imitation of her father's
except the skirt came below her knees. Her feet were as small
as a doll's, and encased in the beaded little moccasins, were
as pretty as they could be.</p>

<p>"That is Linna," said the proud father as she came obediently
forward.</p>
