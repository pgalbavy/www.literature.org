<p>After all the elaborate preparations for the capture of the burglars,
the whole business had fallen so flat that the officers of the
law themselves laughed at the farcical termination. Nothing criminal
was attempted, and Damietta never was more peaceful in all its
history than it was during the many weeks and months which followed.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of all this, there could be no question that
such a burglarious scheme at one time was contemplated. The cipher
telegrams, and the surveillance to which Ben Mayberry was subjected,
together with the attempted assault upon him, made this too manifest
to be disputed.</p>

<p>"They simply discovered the preparations made by the authorities,"
I said to Ben, "and they had prudence enough to withdraw."</p>

<p>"Do you believe they have given it up altogether?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it. They have simply deferred the execution until some
safer time. We must continue to be on the lookout for telegrams
in cipher. These gentry have evil designs upon Damietta, as will
be proven before we are many years older."</p>

<p>When Ben Mayberry reached the age of fifteen, he attained an
important epoch in his life. He had long been one of the most
skillful operators in the district, being remarkably quick and
accurate.</p>

<p>I have told enough to prove his courteous disposition toward
all who entered our office. The pretended Mr. Jones, who acted
the part of the ignorant farmer, was, as I have stated, a high
official of the company, who took odd means to test the character
and skill of our employees. The test in the case of young Mayberry
proved most satisfactory in every respect.</p>

<p>At my request, I was transferred to one of the cities in the
Eastern States, where the climate agreed better with me. I was
given charge of an important office, an advance made in my wages,
and everything was done to make the change agreeable. Such being
the fact, it is no assumption on my part to say that my administration
of the exacting duties in Damietta had been fully appreciated
by my superior officers.</p>

<p>Ben Mayberry was made manager of the office in his native city
at a salary of seventy-five dollars per month. This statement
the reader may doubt, for I am quite certain that no telegraphist
of his age was ever given such an important charge, nor is anyone
so young paid such a liberal salary; but, did I feel at liberty
to do so, I could locate Ben Mayberry so closely that all skeptics
could ascertain the facts, in a brief time, precisely as I have
given them.</p>

<p>We have many office managers, in different parts of the country,
who lack several years of their majority; but, as a rule, their
stations are not very important, and their pay is nothing like
what Ben received. There were exceptional circumstances in his
case. He was unusually bright, he was very attentive, he was courteous,
cheerful, and never shirked work. He was popular with our patrons,
and much of the increase in the business of the Damietta office
was due to Ben alone. This became known to those above him, and
they felt that an unusual promotion on his part would not only
be a just recognition of his ability and devotion, but would do
much to stimulate others to imitate the good example set by the
boy.</p>

<p>In addition to all this, it cannot be denied that fortune favored
Ben in a marked degree. The fact that he was swept down the river
in the darkness and tempest, while trying to deliver a telegram
for a messenger who was ill, and that he saved the life of a little
girl, could not fail to operate strongly to his benefit. But he
would have reached the end all the same, without these aids, just
as you, my young friend, may attain the topmost round by climbing
up, up, up, step after step, step after step.</p>

<p>There is no cup in this life without some drops of bitterness,
and, despite the promotion of Ben, which he fully appreciated,
he was cast down by another circumstance, which troubled him more
than he would admit to his closest friends.</p>

<p>He had not seen sweet Dolly Willard since the grand children's
party at Mr. Grandin's, more than two years previous. She had
written him regularly every week for months, and he had been equally
prompt in answering. Ben wrote a beautiful hand, and his missives
to Dolly were long and affectionate. She would have visited her
cousins in Damietta, had they not made a visit to Europe, which
shut off the possibility of her doing so for some time to come.</p>

<p>Ben felt that under the circumstances it was hardly the thing
for him to make a call upon Dolly in New York, though she invited
him to do so.</p>

<p>But during the very week that Ben was given charge of the Damietta
office, the mail failed to bring the usual letter from Dolly.
He waited impatiently for several days and then wrote to her.
There was no response to this, and he felt resentful. He held
out for a fortnight, and then was so worried that he was forced
to write again. But this was equally fruitless of results, and
he became angry.</p>

<p>"She is getting to be quite a large girl; her folks are wealthy,
and she has begun to realize that I am nothing but a poor telegraphist.
Her folks have told her she must look higher, and she has come
to that same mind herself. Ah, well; let it be so!"</p>

<p>That was expressive of his feelings. Sometimes Ben felt like
rebelling against his fate. He had applied himself hard for years;
he possessed an excellent education; he held a prominent position
in the greatest telegraph company of the country, with a prospect
of further advancement before him, and yet, because he was poor,
he was looked down upon by those who were his inferiors in everything
except the single one of wealth.</p>

<p>"It is a great disappointment," he sometimes murmured, "but I
am young; most folks would laugh that one of my age should take
such a fancy to a little girl like Dolly, and they would say I
am certain to get over it very soon. And just there is where they
would all make a great mistake."</p>

<p>And Ben Mayberry was right on that point.</p>
