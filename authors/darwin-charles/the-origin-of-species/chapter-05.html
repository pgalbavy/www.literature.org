<P>

I HAVE hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations
  so common and multiform in organic beings under domestication,
and in a lesser degree in those in a state of nature   had been
due to chance. This, of course, is a wholly incorrect expression, but
it serves to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each
particular variation. Some authors believe it to be as much the
function of the reproductive system to produce individual differences,
or very slight deviations of structure, as to make the child like its
parents. But the much greater variability, as well as the greater
frequency of monstrosities, under domestication or cultivation, than
under nature, leads me to believe that deviations of structure are in
some way due to the nature of the conditions of life, to which the
parents and their more remote ancestors have been exposed during
several generations. I have remarked in the first chapter   but
a long catalogue of facts which cannot be here given would be
necessary to show the truth of the remark   that the
reproductive system is eminently susceptible to changes in the
conditions of life; and to 
this system being functionally disturbed in
the parents, I chiefly attribute the varying or plastic condition of
the offspring. The male and female sexual elements seem to be affected
before that union takes  place which is to form a new
being. In the case of 'sporting' plants, the bud, which in its
earliest condition does not apparently differ essentially from an
ovule, is alone affected. But why, because the reproductive system is
disturbed, this or that part should vary more or less, we are
profoundly ignorant. Nevertheless, we can here and there dimly catch a
faint ray of light, and we may feel sure that there must be some cause
for each deviation of structure, however slight.

<P>
How much direct effect difference of climate, food, &amp;c.,
produces on any being is extremely doubtful. My impression is, that
the effect is extremely small in the case of animals, but perhaps
rather more in that of plants.  We may, at least, safely conclude that
such influences cannot have produced the many striking and complex
co-adaptations of structure between one organic being and another,
which we see everywhere throughout nature. Some little influence may
be attributed to climate, food, &amp;c.: thus, E. Forbes speaks
confidently that shells at their southern limit, and when living in
shallow water, are more brightly coloured than those of the same
species further north or from greater depths. Gould believes that
birds of the same species are more brightly coloured under a clear
atmosphere, than when living on islands or near the coast. So with
insects, Wollaston is convinced that residence near the sea affects
their colours. Moquin-Tandon gives a list of plants which when growing
near the sea-shore have their leaves in some degree fleshy, though not
elsewhere fleshy. Several other such cases could be given.

<P>
The fact of varieties of one species, when they range 
into the zone
of habitation of other species, often acquiring in a very slight
degree some of the characters of such species, accords with our view
that species of all kinds are only well-marked and permanent
varieties. Thus the species of shells which are confined to tropical
and shallow seas are generally brighter-coloured than those confined
to cold and deeper seas. The birds which
are confined to continents are, according to Mr Gould,
brighter-coloured than those of islands. The insect-species confined
to sea-coasts, as every collector knows,
are often brassy or lurid. Plants which live exclusively on the
sea-side are very apt to have fleshy leaves. He who believes in the
creation of each species, will have to say
 that this shell, for instance, was created with bright
colours for a warm sea; but that this other shell became
bright-coloured by variation when it ranged into warmer or shallower
waters.

<P>
When a variation is of the slightest use to a being, we cannot tell
how much of it to attribute to the accumulative action of natural
selection, and how much to the conditions of life. Thus, it is well
known to furriers that animals of the same species have thicker and
better fur the more severe the climate is under which they have lived;
but who can tell how much of this difference may be due to the
warmest-clad individuals having been favoured and preserved during
many generations, and how much to the direct action of the severe
climate? for it would appear that climate has some direct action on
the hair of our domestic quadrupeds.

<P>
Instances could be given of the same variety being produced under
conditions of life as different as can well be conceived; and, on the
other hand, of different varieties being produced from the same
species under the same conditions. Such facts show how indirectly 
the
conditions of life must act. Again, innumerable instances are known to
every naturalist of species keeping true, or not varying at all,
although living under the most opposite climates. Such considerations
as these incline me to lay very little weight on the direct action of
the conditions of life. Indirectly, as already remarked, they seem to
play an important part in affecting the reproductive system, and in
thus inducing variability; and natural selection will then accumulate
all profitable variations, however slight, until they become plainly
developed and appreciable by us.
<P>
<H4>Effects of Use and Disuse</H4> 
<P>
From the
facts alluded to in the first chapter, I think there can be little
doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges
certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications
are inherited. Under free nature, we can have no standard of
comparison, by which to judge of the effects of long-continued use or
disuse, for we know not the parent-forms; but many animals have
structures which can be explained by the effects of disuse. As
Professor Owen has remarked, there is no greater anomaly 
in nature than a bird that cannot fly; yet there are several in this
state. The logger-headed duck of South America can only flap along the
surface of the water, and has its wings in nearly the same condition
as the domestic Aylesbury duck. As the larger ground-feeding birds
seldom take flight except to escape danger, I believe that the nearly
wingless condition of several birds, which now inhabit or have lately
inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beast of prey, has
been caused by disuse. The ostrich indeed inhabits continents and is
exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight, but by
kicking it can defend itself from enemies, as well as any of the
smaller 
quadrupeds. We may imagine that the early progenitor of the
ostrich had habits like those of a bustard, and that as natural
selection increased in successive generations the size and weight of
its body, its legs were used more, and its wings less, until they
became incapable of flight.

<P>
Kirby has remarked (and I have observed the same fact) that the
anterior tarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are very
often broken off; he examined seventeen specimens in his own
collection, and not one had even a relic left. In the Onites apelles
the tarsi are so habitually lost, that the insect has been described
as not having them. In some other genera they are present, but in a
rudimentary condition. In the Ateuchus or sacred beetle of the
Egyptians, they are totally deficient. There is not sufficient
evidence to induce us to believe that mutilations are ever inherited;
and I should prefer explaining the entire absence of the anterior
tarsi in Ateuchus, and their rudimentary condition in some other
genera, by the long-continued effects of disuse in their progenitors;
for as the tarsi are almost always lost in many dung-feeding beetles,
they must be lost early in life, and therefore cannot be much used by
these insects.

<P>
In some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of
structure which are wholly, or mainly, due to natural selection. Mr.
Wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out of
the 550 species inhabiting Madeira, are so far deficient in wings that
they cannot fly; and that of the twenty-nine endemic genera, no less
than twenty-three genera have all their species in this condition!
Several facts, namely, that beetles  in many parts of the
world are very frequently blown to sea and perish; that the beetles in
Madeira, as observed by Mr Wollaston, lie much concealed, until the
wind lulls and the sun shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles
is larger on the exposed Dezertas than in Madeira itself; and
especially the extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted on by Mr.
Wollaston, of the almost entire absence of certain large groups of
beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, and which groups have habits
of life almost necessitating frequent flight;   these several
considerations have made me believe that the wingless condition of so
many Madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of natural selection,
but combined probably with disuse. For during thousands of successive
generations each individual beetle which flew least, either from its
wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or from
indolent habit, will have had the best chance of surviving from not
being blown out to sea; and, on the other hand, those beetles which
most readily took to flight will oftenest have been blown to sea and
thus have been destroyed.

<P>
The insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as
the flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use
their wings to gain their subsistence, have, as Mr. Wollaston suspects,
their wings not at all reduced, but even enlarged. This is quite
compatible with the action of natural selection. For when a new insect
first arrived on the island, the tendency of natural selection to
enlarge or to reduce the wings, would depend on whether a greater
number of individuals were saved by successfully battling with the
winds, or by giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying. As with
mariners ship-wrecked near a coast, it would have been better for the
good swimmers if they had been able to swim still further, whereas it
would have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able
to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck.

<P>
The eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in
size, and in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur. This
state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse,
but aided perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing
rodent, the tuco-tuco, or Ctenomys, is even more subterranean in its
habits than the mole; and I was  assured by a Spaniard,
who had often caught them, that they were frequently blind; one which
I kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause, as appeared
on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane.
As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal,
and as eyes are certainly not indispensable to animals with
subterranean habits, a reduction in their size with the adhesion of
the eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an
advantage; and if so, natural selection would constantly aid the
effects of disuse.

<P>
It is well known that several animals, belonging to the most
different classes, which inhabit the caves of Styria and of Kentucky,
are blind. In some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains,
though the eye is gone; the stand for the telescope is there, though
the telescope with its glasses has been lost. As it is difficult to
imagine that eyes, though useless, could be in any way injurious to
animals living in darkness, I attribute their loss wholly to disuse.
In one of the blind animals, namely, the cave-rat, the eyes are of
immense size; and Professor Silliman thought that it regained, after
living some days in the light, some slight power of vision. In the
same manner as in Madeira the wings of some of the insects have been
enlarged, and the wings of others have been reduced by natural
selection aided by use and disuse, so in the case of the cave-rat
natural selection seems to have struggled with the loss of light and
to have increased the size of the eyes; whereas with all the other
inhabitants of the caves, disuse by itself seems to have done its
work.

<P>
It is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than
deep limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that on the
common view of the blind animals having been separately created for
the American and European caverns, close similarity in their
organisation and affinities might have been expected; but, as Schi&ouml;dte
and others have remarked, this is not the case, and the cave-insects
of the two continents are not more closely allied than might have
been anticipated from the general resemblance of the other inhabitants
of North America and Europe. On my view we must suppose that American
animals, having ordinary powers of vision, slowly migrated by
successive  generations from the outer world into the
deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves, as did European
animals into the caves of Europe. We have some evidence of this
gradation of habit; for, as Schi&ouml;dte remarks, 'animals not far remote
from ordinary forms, prepare the transition from light to darkness.
Next follow those that are constructed for twilight; and, last of all,
those destined for total darkness.' By the time that an animal had
reached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse
will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes,
and natural selection will often have effected other changes, such as
an increase in the length of the antennae or palpi, as a compensation
for blindness. Notwithstanding such modifications, we might expect
still to see in the cave-animals of America, affinities to the other
inhabitants of that continent, and in those of Europe, to the
inhabitants of the European continent. And this is the case with some
of the American cave-animals, as I hear from 
Professor Dana; and some
of the European cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the
surrounding country. It would be most difficult to give any rational
explanation of the affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other
inhabitants of the two continents on the ordinary view of their
independent creation. That several of the inhabitants of the caves of
the Old and New Worlds should be closely related, we might expect from
the well-known relationship of most of their other productions. Far
from feeling any surprise that some of the cave-animals should be very
anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked in regard to the blind fish, the
Amblyopsis, and as is the case with the blind Proteus with reference
to the reptiles of Europe, I am only surprised that more wrecks of
ancient life have not been preserved, owing to the less severe
competition to which the inhabitants of these dark abodes will
probably have been exposed.
<P>
<H4>Acclimatisation</H4> 
<P>
 Habit is hereditary
with plants, as in the period of flowering, in the amount of rain
requisite for seeds to germinate, in the time of sleep, &amp;c., and
this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation. As it is
extremely common for species of the same genus to inhabit very hot and
very cold  countries, and as I believe that all the
species of the same genus have descended from a single parent, if this
view be correct, acclimatisation must be readily effected during
long-continued descent. It is notorious that each species is adapted
to the climate of its own home: species from an arctic or even from a
temperate region cannot endure a tropical climate, or conversely. So
again, many succulent plants cannot endure a damp climate. But the
degree of adaptation of species to the climates under which they live
is often overrated. 
We may infer this from our frequent inability to
predict whether or not an imported plant will endure our climate, and
from the number of plants and animals brought from warmer countries
which here enjoy good health. We have reason to believe that species
in a state of nature are limited in their ranges by the competition of
other organic beings quite as much as, or more than, by adaptation to
particular climates. But whether or not the adaptation be generally
very close, we have evidence, in the case of some few plants, of their
becoming, to a certain extent, naturally habituated to different
temperatures, or becoming acclimatised: thus the pines and
rhododendrons, raised from seed collected by Dr Hooker from trees
growing at different heights on the Himalaya were found in this
country to possess different constitutional powers of resisting cold.
Mr Thwaites informs me that he has observed similar facts in Ceylon,
and analogous observations have been made by Mr H. C. Watson on
European species of plants brought from the Azores to England. In
regard to animals, several authentic cases could be given of species
within historical times having largely extended their range from
warmer to cooler latitudes, and conversely; but we do not positively
know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native climate,
but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor do we
know that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new
homes.

<P>
As I believe that our domestic animals were originally chosen by
uncivilised man because they were useful and bred readily under
confinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable of
far-extended transportation, I think the common and extraordinary
capacity in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most
different climates but of being  perfectly 
fertile (a far
severer test) under them, may be used as an argument that a large
proportion of other animals, now in a state of nature, could easily be
brought to bear widely different climates. We must not, however, push
the foregoing argument too far, on account of 
the probable origin of some of our domestic
animals from several wild stocks: the blood, for instance, of a
tropical and arctic wolf or wild dog may perhaps be mingled in our
domestic breeds. The rat and mouse cannot be considered as domestic
animals, but they have been transported by man to many parts of the
world, and now have a far wider range than any other rodent, living
free under the cold climate of Faroe in the north and of the Falklands
in the south, and on many islands in the torrid zones. Hence I am
inclined to look at adaptation to any special climate as a quality
readily grafted on an innate wide flexibility of constitution, which
is common to most animals. On this view, 
the capacity of enduring the most different
climates by man himself and by his domestic animals, and such facts as
that former species of the elephant and rhinoceros were capable of
enduring a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now 
all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits,
ought not to be looked at as anomalies, but
merely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution,
brought, under peculiar circumstances, into play.

<P>
How much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate
is due to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of
varieties having different innate constitutions, and how much to 
means combined, is a very obscure question.
That habit or custom has some influence I must believe, both from
analogy, and from the incessant advice given in agricultural works,
even in the ancient Encyclopaedias of China, to be very cautious 
in
transposing animals from one district to another; for it is not likely
that man should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds and
sub-breeds with constitutions specially fitted for their own
districts: the result must, I think, be due to habit. On the other
hand, I can see no reason to doubt that
natural selection will continually tend to preserve those individuals
which are born with constitutions best adapted to their native
countries. In treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants,
certain varieties are said to withstand certain climates
better than others: this is very strikingly shown in works on fruit
trees published in the United States, in which certain varieties are
habitually recommended for the northern, and others for the southern
States; and as most of these varieties are of recent origin, they
cannot owe their constitutional differences to habit. The case of the
Jerusalem artichoke, which is never propagated by seed, and of which
consequently new varieties have not been produced, has even been
advanced   for it is now as tender as ever it was -- as
proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected!  The case, also, of
the kidney-bean has been often cited for a similar purpose, and with
much greater weight; but until some one will sow, during a score of
generations, his kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion
are destroyed by frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors,
with care to prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from
these seedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be
said to have been even tried. Nor let it be supposed that no
differences in the constitution of seedling kidney-beans ever appear,
for an account has been published how much more hardy some seedlings
appeared to be than others.

<P>
On the whole, I think we may conclude that habit, 
use, and disuse,
have, in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of
the constitution, and of the structure of various organs; but that the
effects of use and disuse have often been largely combined with, and
sometimes overmastered by, the natural selection of innate
differences.
<P>
<H4>Correlation of Growth</H4> 
<P>
 I mean by this
expression that the whole organisation is so tied together during its
growth and development, that when slight variations in any one part
occur, and are accumulated through natural selection, other parts
become modified. This is a very important subject, most imperfectly
understood. The most obvious case is, that modifications accumulated
solely for the good of the young or larva, will, it may safely be
concluded, affect the structure of the adult; in the same manner as
any malconformation affecting the early embryo, seriously affects the
whole organisation of the adult. The several  parts of the
body which are homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period,
are alike, seem liable to vary in an allied manner: we see this in the
right and left sides of the body varying in the same manner; in the
front and hind legs, and even in the jaws
and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed to be
homologous with the limbs. These tendencies, I do not doubt, may be
mastered more or less completely by natural selection: thus a family
of stags once existed with an antler only on one side; and if this had
been of any great use to the breed it might
probably have been rendered permanent by natural selection.

<P>
Homologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to
cohere; this is often seen in monstrous plants; and nothing is more
common than the union of homologous parts in normal structures, as the
union of 
the petals of the corolla into a
tube. Hard parts seem to affect the form of adjoining soft parts; it
is believed by some authors that the diversity in the shape of the
pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity in the shape of their
kidneys. Others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the human
mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of 
the child. In snakes, according to Schlegel, the
shape of the body and the manner of swallowing determine the position
of several of the most important viscera.

<P>
The nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite
obscure. M. Is. Geoffroy St Hilaire has forcibly remarked, that
certain malconformations very frequently, and that others rarely
coexist, without our being able to assign any reason. What can be more
singular than the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats, and
the tortoise-shell colour with the female sex; the feathered feet and
skin between the outer toes in pigeons, and the presence of more or
less down on the young birds when first hatched, with the future
colour of their plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair and
teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here probably homology comes
into play? With respect to this latter case of correlation, I think it
can hardly be accidental, that if we pick out the two orders of
mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal coverings, viz.
Cetacea (whales) and Edentata (armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters,
 
 &amp;c.), that these are likewise the most abnormal in
their teeth.

<P>
I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws
of correlation in modifying important structures, independently of
utility and, therefore, of natural selection, than that of the
difference between the outer and inner flowers in some Compositous and
Umbelliferous plants. Every one knows the 
difference in the ray and
central florets of, for instance, the daisy, and this difference is
often accompanied with the abortion of parts of the flower. But, in
some Compositous plants, the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture;
and even the ovary itself, with its accessory parts, differs, as has
been described by Cassini. These differences have been attributed by
some authors to pressure, and the shape of the seeds in the
ray-florets in some Compositae countenances this idea; but, in the
case of the corolla of the Umbelliferae,
it is by no means, as Dr Hooker informs me, in species with the
densest heads that the inner and outer
flowers most frequently differ. It might have been thought that the
development of the ray-petals by drawing nourishment from certain
other parts of the flower had caused their abortion; but in some
Compositae there is a difference in the seeds of the outer and inner
florets without any difference in the corolla. Possibly, these several
differences may be connected with some difference in the flow of
nutriment towards the central and external flowers: we know, at least,
that in irregular flowers, those nearest to the axis are oftenest
subject to peloria, and become regular. I may add, as an instance of
this, and of a striking case of correlation, that I have recently
observed in some garden pelargoniums, that the central flower of the
truss often loses the patches of darker colour in the two upper
petals; and that when this occurs, the adherent nectary is quite
aborted; when the colour is absent from only one of the two upper
petals, the nectary is only much shortened.

<P>
With respect to the difference in the corolla of the central and
exterior flowers of a head or umbel, I do not feel at all sure that C.
C. Sprengel's idea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects,
whose agency is highly advantageous in the fertilisation of plants of
these two orders, is so far-fetched, as it may at first appear: and if
it be advantageous, natural selection may have  come into
play. But in regard to the differences both in the internal and
external structure of the seeds, which are not always correlated with
any differences in the flowers, it seems impossible that they can be
in any way advantageous to the plant: yet in the Umbelliferae these
differences are of such apparent importance   the seeds being in
some cases, according to Tausch, orthospermous in the exterior flowers
and coelospermous in the central flowers,   that the elder De
Candolle founded his main divisions of the
order on analogous differences. Hence we see that modifications of
structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due
to unknown laws of correlated growth, and without being, as far as we
can see, of the slightest service to the species.

<P>
We may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth, structures
which are common to whole groups of species, and which in 
truth are simply due to inheritance; for an
ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural selection some
one modification in structure, and, after thousands of generations,
some other and independent modification; and these two modifications,
having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with diverse
habits, would naturally be thought to be correlated in some necessary
manner. So, again, I do not doubt that some
apparent correlations, occurring throughout whole orders, are entirely
due to the manner alone in which natural
selection can act. For instance, Alph. De Candolle has remarked that
winged seeds are never found in fruits which do not open: I should
explain the rule by the fact
that seeds could not gradually become winged
through natural selection, except in fruits which opened; so that the
individual plants producing 
seeds which were a little better fitted to
be wafted further, might get an advantage over those producing seed
less fitted for dispersal; and this process could not possibly go on
in fruit which did not open.

<P>
The elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about
the same period, their law of compensation or
balancement of growth; or, as Goethe expressed it, 'in order to spend
on one side, nature is forced to economise on the other side.' I think
this holds true to a certain extent with our domestic productions: if
nourishment flows to one part or organ in excess, it rarely flows, at
 least in excess, to another part; thus it is difficult to
get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily. The same varieties
of the cabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage and a
copious supply of oil-bearing seeds. When the seeds in our fruits
become atrophied, the fruit itself gains largely in size and quality.
In our poultry, a large tuft of feathers on the head is generally
accompanied by a diminished comb, and a large beard by diminished
wattles.  With species in a state of nature it can hardly be
maintained that the law is of universal application; but many good
observers, more especially botanists, believe in its truth. I will
not, however, here give any instances, for I see hardly any way of
distinguishing between the effects, on the one hand, of a part being
largely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining
part being reduced by this same process or by disuse, and, on the
other hand, the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to
the excess of growth in another and adjoining part.

<P>
I suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have
been advanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a
more general principle, namely, that natural selection is continually
trying to economise in every part of the organisation. If under
changed conditions of life a structure before useful becomes less
useful, any diminution, however slight, in its development, will be
seized on by natural selection, for it will profit the individual not
to have its nutriment wasted in building up an useless structure. I
can thus only understand a fact with which I was much struck when
examining cirripedes, and of which many other instances could be
given: namely, that when a cirripede is parasitic within another and
is thus protected, it loses more or less
completely its own shell or carapace. This is the case with the male
Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner with the Proteolepas: for
the carapace in all other cirripedes consists of the three
highly-important anterior segments of the head enormously developed,
and furnished with great nerves and muscles; 
but in the parasitic and protected Proteolepas,
the whole anterior part of the head is reduced to the merest rudiment
attached to the bases of the prehensile antennae.  Now the saving of a
large and complex structure, when rendered  superfluous by
the parasitic habits of the Proteolepas, though effected by slow
steps, would be a decided advantage to each successive individual of
the species; for in the struggle for life
to which every animal is exposed, each individual
Proteolepas would have a better chance of supporting itself, by less
nutriment being wasted in developing a structure now become useless.

<P>
Thus, as I believe, natural selection will always succeed in the
long run in reducing and saving every part of the organisation, as
soon as it is rendered superfluous, without by any means causing some
other part to be largely developed in a corresponding degree. And,
conversely, that natural selection may perfectly well succeed in
largely developing any organ, without requiring as a necessary
compensation the reduction of some adjoining part.

<P>
It seems to be a rule, as remarked by Is. Geoffroy St Hilaire, both
in varieties and in species, that when any part or organ is repeated
many times in the structure of the same individual (as the vertebrae
in snakes, and the stamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is
variable; whereas the number of the same part or organ, when it occurs
in lesser numbers, is constant. The same author and some botanists
have further remarked that multiple parts are also very liable to
variation in structure. Inasmuch as this 'vegetative repetition,' to
use Prof. Owen's expression, seems to be a sign of low organisation;
the foregoing remark seems connected with the very general opinion of
naturalists, that beings low in the scale of nature are more variable
than those which are higher. I presume that lowness in this case means
that the several parts of the organisation have been but little
specialised for particular functions; and as long as the same part has
to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see why it should remain
variable, that is, why natural selection should have preserved or
rejected each little deviation of form less carefully than when the
part has to serve for one special purpose alone. In the same way that
a knife which has to cut all sorts of things may be of almost any
shape; whilst a tool for some particular object had better be of some
particular shape. Natural selection, it should never be forgotten, can
act on each part of each being, solely through and for its advantage.


<P>
Rudimentary parts, it has been stated by some authors, and I
believe with truth, are apt to be highly variable. We shall have to
recur to the general subject of rudimentary and aborted organs; and I
will here only add that their variability seems to be owing to their
uselessness, and therefore to natural selection having no power to
check deviations in their structure. Thus 
rudimentary parts are left
to the free play of the various laws of growth, to the effects of
long-continued disuse, and to the tendency to reversion.
<P>
<H4>A part developed in any species in an
extraordinary degree or manner, in comparison with the same part in
allied species, tends to be highly variable.</H4> 
<P>
 Several years ago
I was much struck with a remark, nearly to the above effect, published
by Mr Waterhouse. I infer also from an observation made by Professor
Owen, with respect to the length of the arms of the ourang-outang,
that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion. It is hopeless to
attempt to convince any one of the truth of this proposition without
giving the long array of facts which I have collected, and which
cannot possibly be here introduced. I can only state my conviction
that it is a rule of high generality. I am aware of several causes of
error, but I hope that I have made due allowance for them. It should
be understood that the rule by no means applies to any part, however
unusually developed, unless it be unusually developed in comparison
with the same part in closely allied species. Thus, the bat's wing is
a most abnormal structure in the class mammalia; but the rule would
not here apply, because there is a whole group of bats having wings;
it would apply only if some one species of bat had its wings developed
in some remarkable manner in comparison with the other species of the
same genus. The rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary
sexual characters, when displayed in any unusual manner. The term,
secondary sexual characters, used by Hunter, applies to characters
which are attached to one sex, but are not
directly connected with the act of reproduction. The rule applies to
males and females; but as females more rarely offer remarkable
secondary sexual characters, it applies 
more rarely to them.  The rule
being so plainly applicable in the case  of secondary
sexual characters, may be due to the great variability of these
characters, whether or not displayed in any unusual manner   of
which fact I think there can be little doubt. But that our rule is not
confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case
of hermaphrodite cirripedes; and I may here add, that I particularly
attended to Mr. Waterhouse's remark, whilst investigating this Order,
and I am fully convinced that the rule almost invariably holds good
with cirripedes. I shall, in my future work, give a list of the more
remarkable cases; I will here only briefly give one, as it illustrates
the rule in its largest application. The opercular valves of sessile
cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in every sense of the word, very
important structures, and they differ extremely little even in
different genera; but in the several species of one genus, Pyrgoma,
these valves present a marvellous amount of diversification: the
homologous valves in the different species being sometimes wholly
unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the individuals of
several of the species is so great, that it is no exaggeration to
state that the varieties differ more from each other in the characters
of these important valves than do other species of distinct genera.

<P>
As birds within the same country vary in a remarkably small degree,
I have particularly attended to them, and
the rule seems to me certainly to hold good in this class. I cannot
make out that it applies to plants, and this would seriously have
shaken my belief in its truth, had not the great variability in plants
made it particularly difficult to compare their relative degrees of
variability.

<P>
When we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or
manner in any species, the fair 
presumption is that it is of high
importance to that species; nevertheless the part in this case is
eminently liable to variation. Why should this be so? On the view that
each species has been independently created, with all its parts as we
now see them, I can see no explanation. But on the view that groups of
species have descended from other species, and have been modified
through natural selection, I think we can obtain some light. In our
domestic animals, if any part, or the whole animal, be neglected and
no selection be applied, that part (for instance, the comb in the
Dorking  fowl) or the whole breed will cease to have a
nearly uniform character. The breed will then be said to have
degenerated.  In rudimentary organs, and in those which have been but
little specialized for any particular purpose, and perhaps in
polymorphic groups, we see a nearly parallel natural case; for in such
cases natural selection either has not or cannot come into full play,
and thus the organisation is left in a fluctuating condition. But what
here more especially concerns us is, that in our domestic animals
those points, which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by
continued selection, are also eminently liable to variation. Look at
the breeds of the pigeon; see what a prodigious amount of difference
there is in the beak of the different tumblers, in the beak and wattle
of the different carriers, in the carriage and tail of our fantails,
&amp;c., these being the points now mainly attended to by English
fanciers. Even in the sub-breeds, as in the short-faced tumbler, it is
notoriously difficult to breed them nearly to perfection, and
frequently individuals are born which depart widely from the standard.
There may be truly said to be a constant struggle going on between, on
the one hand, the tendency to reversion to a less modified state, as
well as an innate tendency to further 
variability of all kinds, and,
on the other hand, the power of steady selection to keep the breed
true. In the long run selection gains the day, and we do not expect to
fail so far as to breed a bird as coarse as a common tumbler from a
good short-faced strain. But as long as selection is rapidly going on,
there may always be expected to be much variability in the structure
undergoing modification. It further deserves notice that these
variable characters, produced by man's selection, sometimes become
attached, from causes quite unknown to us, more to one sex than to the
other, generally to the male sex, as with the wattle of carriers and
the enlarged crop of pouters.

<P>
Now let us turn to nature. When a part has been developed in an
extraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other
species of the same genus, we may conclude that this part has
undergone an extraordinary amount of modification, since the period
when the species branched off from the common progenitor of the genus.
This period will seldom be remote in  any extreme degree,
as species very rarely endure for more than one geological period. An
extraordinary amount of modification implies an unusually large and
long-continued amount of variability, which has continually been
accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of the species. But
as the variability of the extraordinarily-developed part or organ has
been so great and long-continued within a period not excessively
remote, we might, as a general rule, expect still to find more
variability in such parts than in other parts of the organisation,
which have remained for a much longer period nearly constant. And
this, I am convinced, is the case. That the struggle between natural
selection on the one hand, and the tendency to reversion and
variability on the other hand, will in the 
course of time cease; and
that the most abnormally developed organs may be made constant, I can
see no reason to doubt. Hence when an
organ, however abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in
approximately the same condition to many modified descendants, as in
the case of the wing of the bat, it must have existed, according to my
theory, for an immense period in nearly the same state; and thus it
comes to be no more variable than any other structure. It is only in
those cases in which the modification has been comparatively recent
and extraordinarily great that we ought to find the <I>generative
variability,</I> as it may be called,
still present in a high degree. For in this case the variability will
seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the
individuals varying in the required manner and degree, and by the
continued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less
modified condition.

<P>
The principle included in these remarks may be extended.  It is
notorious that specific characters are more variable than generic.
To explain by a simple example what is
meant. If some species in a large genus of plants had blue flowers and
some had red, the colour would be only a specific character, and no
one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying into red, or
conversely; but if all the species had blue flowers, the colour would
become a generic character, and its variation would be a more unusual
circumstance. I have chosen this example because an explanation is not
in this case applicable, which most  naturalists would
advance, namely, that specific characters are more variable than
generic, because they are taken from parts of less physiological
importance than those commonly used for classing genera. I believe
this explanation is partly, yet only indirectly, true; I shall,
however, have to return 
to this subject in our chapter on
Classification. It would be almost superfluous to adduce evidence in
support of the above statement, that specific characters are more
variable than generic; but I have repeatedly noticed in works on
natural history, that when an author has remarked with surprise that
some <I>important</I> organ or part, which is
generally very constant throughout large groups of species, has <I>differed</I> considerably in closely-allied species,
that it has, also, been <I>variable</I> in the
individuals of some of the species. And this fact shows that a
character, which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value
and becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its
physiological importance may remain the same. Something of the same
kind applies to monstrosities: at least Is. Geoffroy 
St. Hilaire seems to entertain no doubt, that the
more an organ normally differs in the different species of the same
group, the more subject it is to individual anomalies.

<P>
On the ordinary view of each species having been independently
created, why should that part of the structure, which differs from the
same part in other independently-created species of the same genus, be
more variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several
species? I do not see that any explanation can be given. But on the
view of species being only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we
might surely expect to find them still often continuing to vary in
those parts of their structure which have varied within a moderately
recent period, and which have thus come to differ. Or to state the
case in another manner:   the points in which all the species of
a genus resemble each other, and in which they differ from the species
of some other genus, are called generic characters; and these
characters in common I attribute to inheritance from a common
progenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural selection
will have modified several species, fitted to more or less
widely-different habits, in exactly the same manner: and as these
so-called generic characters have been inherited from a remote
period, since that period when the species first branched off
from their common progenitor, and subsequently have not varied or come
to differ in any degree, or only in a slight degree, it is not
probable that they should vary at the present day. On the other hand,
the points in which species differ from other species of the same
genus, are called specific characters; and as these specific
characters have varied and come to differ within the period of the
branching off of the species from a common progenitor, it is probable
that they should still often be in some degree variable,   at
least more variable than those parts of the organisation which have
for a very long period remained constant.

<P>
In connexion with the present subject, I will make only two other
remarks. I think it will be admitted, without my entering on details,
that secondary sexual characters are very variable; I think it also
will be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other
more widely in their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts
of their organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference
between the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual
characters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference
between their females; and the truth of this proposition will be
granted. The cause of the original variability of secondary sexual
characters is not manifest; but we can see why these characters should
not have been rendered as constant and uniform as other parts of the
organisation; for secondary sexual characters have been accumulated by
sexual selection, which 
is less rigid in its action than ordinary
selection, as it does not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring
to the less favoured males.  Whatever the cause may be of the
variability of secondary sexual characters, as they are highly
variable, sexual selection will have had a wide scope for action, and
may thus readily have succeeded in giving to the species of the same
group a greater amount of difference in their sexual characters, than
in other parts of their structure.

<P>
It is a remarkable fact, that the secondary sexual differences
between the two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in
the very same parts of the organisation in which the different species
of the same genus differ from each other. Of this fact I will give in
illustration two instances, the first which  happen to
stand on my list; and as the differences in these cases are of a very
unusual nature, the relation can hardly be accidental. The same number
of joints in the tarsi is a character generally common to very large
groups of beetles, but in the Engidae, as Westwood has remarked, the
number varies greatly; and the number likewise differs in the two
sexes of the same species: again in fossorial hymenoptera, the manner
of neuration of the wings is a character of the highest importance,
because common to large groups; but in certain genera the neuration
differs in the different species, and likewise in the two sexes of the
same species.  This relation has a clear meaning on my view of the
subject: I look at all the species of the same genus as having as
certainly descended from the same progenitor, as have the two sexes of
any one of the species. Consequently, whatever part of the structure
of the common progenitor, or of its early descendants, became
variable; variations of this part would it is highly probable, be
taken advantage of by natural and sexual selection, in 
order to fit
the several species to their several places in the economy of nature,
and likewise to fit the two sexes of the same species to each other,
or to fit the males and females to different habits of life, or the
males to struggle with other males for the possession of the females.

<P>
Finally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of specific
characters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of
generic characters, or those which the species possess in common;
  that the frequent extreme variability of any part which is
developed in a species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with
the same part in its congeners; and the not great degree of
variability in a part, however extraordinarily it may be developed, if
it be common to a whole group of species;   that the great
variability of secondary sexual characters, and the great amount of
difference in these same characters between closely allied species;
  that secondary sexual and ordinary specific differences are
generally displayed in the same parts of the organisation,   are
all principles closely connected together. All being mainly due to the
species of the same group having descended from a common progenitor,
from whom they have inherited much in common,   to parts which
have recently and largely  varied being more likely still
to go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and have
not varied,   to natural selection having more or less
completely, according to the lapse of time, overmastered the tendency
to reversion and to further variability,   to sexual selection
being less rigid than ordinary selection,   and to variations in
the same parts having been accumulated by natural and sexual
selection, and thus adapted for secondary sexual, and for ordinary
specific purposes.
<P>
<H4>Distinct species present analogous variations;
and a variety of one species often assumes some of the characters of
an allied species, or reverts to some of the characters of an early
progenitor.</H4> 
<P>
These propositions will be most readily understood
by looking to our domestic races. The most distinct breeds of pigeons,
in countries most widely apart, present sub-varieties with reversed
feathers on the head and feathers on the feet,   characters not
possessed by the aboriginal rock-pigeon; these then are analogous
variations in two or more distinct races. The frequent presence of
fourteen or even sixteen tail-feathers in the pouter, may be
considered as a variation representing the normal structure of another
race, the fantail. I presume that no one will doubt that all such
analogous variations are due to the several
races of the pigeon having inherited from a common parent the same
constitution and tendency to variation, when acted on by similar
unknown influences. In the vegetable kingdom we have a case of
analogous variation, in the enlarged stems, or roots as commonly
called, of the Swedish turnip and Ruta baga, plants which several
botanists rank as varieties produced by cultivation from a common
parent: if this be not so, the case will then be one of analogous
variation in two so-called distinct species; and to these a third may
be added, namely, the common turnip. According to the ordinary view of
each species having been independently created, we should have to
attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems of these three plants,
not to the <I>vera causa</I> of community of
descent, and a consequent tendency to vary in a like manner, but to
three separate yet closely related acts of creation.

<P>
With pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the 
occasional appearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds
with two black bars on the wings, a white 
rump, a bar at the end of
the tail, with the outer feathers externally edged near their bases
with white. As all these marks are characteristic of the parent
rock-pigeon, I presume that no one will doubt that this is a case of
reversion, and not of a new yet analogous variation appearing in the
several breeds. We may I think confidently come to this conclusion,
because, as we have seen, these coloured marks are eminently liable to
appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct and differently
coloured breeds; and in this case there is nothing in the external
conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the slaty-blue, with
the several marks, beyond the influence of the mere act of crossing on
the laws of inheritance.

<P>
No doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should
reappear after having been lost for many, perhaps for hundreds of
generations. But when a breed has been crossed only once by some other
breed, the offspring occasionally show a tendency to revert in
character to the foreign breed for many generations   some say,
for a dozen or even a score of generations. After twelve generations,
the proportion of blood, to use a common expression, of any one
ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and yet, as we see, it is generally
believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this very small
proportion of foreign blood. In a breed which has not been crossed,
but in which <I>both</I> parents have lost some
character which their progenitor possessed, the tendency, whether
strong or weak, to reproduce the lost character might be, as was
formerly remarked, for all that we can see to the contrary,
transmitted for almost any number of generations. When a character
which has been lost in a breed, reappears after a great number of
generations, the most probable hypothesis is, not that the offspring
suddenly takes after an ancestor some hundred generations 
distant, but
that in each successive generation there has been a tendency to
reproduce the character in question, which at last, under unknown
favourable conditions, gains an ascendancy. For instance, it is
probable that in each generation of the barb-pigeon, which produces
most rarely a blue and black-barred bird, there has been a tendency in
each  generation in the plumage to assume this colour.
This view is hypothetical, but could be supported by some facts; and I
can see no more abstract improbability in a tendency to produce any
character being inherited for an endless number of generations, than
in quite useless or rudimentary organs being, as we all know them to
be, thus inherited. Indeed, we may sometimes observe a mere tendency
to produce a rudiment inherited: for instance, in the common
snapdragon (Antirrhinum) a rudiment of a fifth stamen so often
appears, that this plant must have an inherited tendency to produce
it.

<P>
As all the species of the same genus are supposed, on my theory, to
have descended from a common parent, it might be expected that they
would occasionally vary in an analogous manner; so that a variety of
one species would resemble in some of its characters another species;
this other species being on my view only a well-marked and permanent
variety.  But characters thus gained would probably be of an
unimportant nature, for the presence of all important characters will
be governed by natural selection, in accordance with the diverse
habits of the species, and will not be left to the mutual action of
the conditions of life and of a similar inherited constitution. It
might further be expected that the species of the same genus would
occasionally exhibit reversions to lost ancestral characters. As,
however, we never know the exact character of the common ancestor of a
group, we could not distinguish these two 
cases: if, for instance, we
did not know that the rock-pigeon was not feather-footed or
turn-crowned, we could not have told, whether these characters in our
domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous variations; but we
might have inferred that the blueness was a case of reversion, from
the number of the markings, which are correlated with the blue tint,
and which it does not appear probable would all appear together from
simple variation.  More especially we might have inferred this, from
the blue colour and marks so often appearing when distinct breeds of
diverse colours are crossed. Hence, though under nature it must
generally be left doubtful, what cases are reversions to an anciently
existing character, and what are new but analogous variations, yet we
ought, on my theory, sometimes to find the varying offspring
of a species assuming characters (either from reversion or
from analogous variation) which already occur in some members of the
same group.  And this undoubtedly is the case in nature.

<P>
A considerable part of the difficulty in recognising a variable
species in our systematic works, is due to its varieties mocking, as
it were, come of the other species of the same genus.  A considerable
catalogue, also, could be given of forms intermediate between two
other forms, which themselves must be doubtfully ranked as either
varieties or species, that the one in varying has assumed some of the
characters of the other, so as to produce the intermediate form.  But
the best evidence is afforded by parts or organs of an important and
uniform nature occasionally varying so as to acquire, in some degree,
the character of the same part or organ in an allied species.  I have
collected a long list of such cases; but 
here, as before, I lie under
a great disadvantage in not being able to give them.  I can only
repeat that such cases certainly do occur, and seem to me very
remarkable.

<P>
I will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as
affecting any important character, but from occurring in several
species of the same genus, partly under domestication and partly under
nature.  It is a case apparently of reversion. The ass not rarely has
very distinct transverse bars on its legs, like those of a zebra: it
has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal, and from
inquiries which I have made, I believe this to be true.  It has also
been asserted that the stripe on each shoulder is sometimes double.
The shoulder-stripe is certainly very variable in length and outline.
A white ass, but <I>not</I> an albino, has been
described without either spinal or shoulder-stripe; and these stripes
are sometimes very obscure, or actually quite lost, in dark-coloured
asses.  The koulan of Pallas is said to have been seen with a double
shoulder-stripe; but traces of it, as stated by Mr Blyth and others,
occasionally appear: and I have been informed by Colonel Poole that
foals of this species are generally striped on the legs, and faintly
on the shoulder.  The quagga,  though so plainly barred
like a zebra over the body, is without bars on the legs; but Dr Gray
has figured one specimen with very distinct zebra-like bars on the
hocks.

<P>
With respect to the horse, I have collected cases in England of the
spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of <I>
all</I> colours; transverse bars on the legs are not
rare in duns, mouse-duns, and in one instance in a chestnut: a faint
shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen in duns, and I have seen a trace
in a 
bay horse. My son made a careful examination and sketch for me of
a dun Belgian cart-horse with a double stripe on each shoulder and
with leg-stripes; and a man, whom I can implicitly 
trust, has examined for me a small dun Welch pony
with <I>three</I> short parallel stripes on each
shoulder.

<P>
In the north-west part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is so
generally striped, that, as I hear from Colonel Poole, who examined
the breed for the Indian Government, a horse without stripes is not
considered as purely-bred. The spine is always striped; the legs are
generally barred; and the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double
and sometimes treble, is common; the side of the face, moreover, is
sometimes striped. The stripes are plainest in the foal; and sometimes
quite disappear in old horses. Colonel Poole has seen both gray and
bay Kattywar horses striped when first foaled. I have, also, reason to
suspect, from information given me by Mr. W. W. Edwards, that with the
English race-horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the foal than
in the full-grown animal. Without here entering on further details, I
may state that I have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in
horses of very different breeds, in various countries from Britain to
Eastern China; and from Norway in the north to the Malay Archipelago
in the south.  In all parts of the world these stripes occur far
oftenest in duns and mouse-duns; by the term dun a large range of
colour is included, from one between brown and black to a close
approach to cream-colour.

<P>
I am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith, who has written on this
subject, believes that the several breeds of the horse have descended
from several aboriginal species   one of which, the dun, was
striped; and that the above-described appearances are  all
due to ancient 
crosses with the dun stock. But I am not at all
satisfied with this theory, and should be loth to apply it to breeds
so distinct as the heavy Belgian cart-horse, Welch ponies, cobs, the
lanky Kattywar race, &amp;c., inhabiting the most distant parts of the
world.

<P>
Now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of
the horse-genus. Rollin asserts, that the common mule from the 
ass and horse is particularly apt to have bars on
its legs. I once saw a mule with its legs
so much striped that any one at first would have thought that it must
have been the product of a zebra; and Mr. W. C. Martin, in his
excellent treatise on the horse, has given a figure of a similar mule.
In four coloured drawings, which I have seen, of hybrids between the
ass and zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest of
the body; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe.  In
Lord Moreton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the
hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the
mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the
legs than is even the pure quagga. Lastly, and this is another most
remarkable case, a hybrid has been figured by Dr Gray (and he informs
me that he knows of a second case) from the ass and the hemionus; and
this hybrid, though the ass seldom has stripes on its legs and the
hemionus has none and has not even a shoulder-stripe, nevertheless had
all four legs barred, and had three short shoulder-stripes, like those
on the dun Welch pony, and even had some zebra-like stripes on the
sides of its face. With respect to this
last fact, I was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears
from what would commonly be called an accident, that I was led solely
from the occurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass
and hemionus, 
to ask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever
occur in the eminently striped Kattywar breed of horses, and was, as
we have seen, answered in the affirmative.

<P>
What now are we to say to these several facts? We see several very
distinct species of the horse-genus becoming, by simple variation,
striped on the legs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like an
ass. In the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint
appears   a tint which approaches to that of the 
general colouring of the other species of the genus. The appearance of
the stripes is not accompanied by any change of form or by any other
new character. We see this tendency to become striped most strongly
displayed in hybrids from between several of the most distinct
species. Now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons: they
are descended from a pigeon (including two or three sub-species or
geographical races) of a bluish colour, with certain bars and other
marks; and when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish tint,
these bars and other marks invariably reappear; but without any
other change of form or character.  When the oldest and truest breeds
of various colours are crossed, we see a strong tendency for the blue
tint and bars and marks to reappear in the mongrels. I have stated
that the most probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of
very ancient characters, is   that there is a <I>
tendency</I> in the young of each successive
generation to produce the long-lost character, and that this tendency,
from unknown causes, sometimes prevails. And we have just seen that in
several species of the horse-genus the stripes are either plainer or
appear more commonly in the young than in the old. Call the breeds of
pigeons, some of which have bred true for centuries, species; and how
exactly parallel is the case with that of the species of the
horse-genus! 
For myself, I venture confidently to look back thousands
on thousands of generations, and I see an animal striped like a zebra,
but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed, the common parent
of our domestic horse, whether or not it be descended from one or more
wild stocks, of the ass, the hemionus, quagga, and zebra.

<P>
He who believes that each equine species was independently created,
will, I presume, assert that each species has been created with a
tendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication, in this
particular manner, so as often to become striped like other species of
the genus; and that each has been created with a strong tendency, when
crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world, to
produce hybrids resembling in their stripes, not their own parents,
but other species of the genus. To admit this view is, as it seems to
me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown, cause.
It makes the  works of God a mere mockery and deception; I
would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists,
that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in stone so
as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore.

<H4>Summary</H4>

Our ignorance of the laws of
variation is profound. Not in one case out of a hundred can we pretend
to assign any reason why this or that part differs, more or less, from
the same part in the parents. But whenever we have the means of
instituting a comparison, the same laws appear to have acted in
producing the lesser differences between varieties of the same
species, and the greater differences between species of the same
genus. The external conditions of life, as climate and food, &amp;c.,
seem to have induced some slight modifications. Habit in producing
constitutional differences, and use in strengthening, and disuse in
weakening and diminishing organs, seem to have been more potent in
their effects. Homologous parts tend to vary in the same way, and
homologous parts tend to cohere.  Modifications in hard parts and in
external parts sometimes affect softer and internal parts. When one
part is largely developed, perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from
the adjoining parts; and every part of the structure which can be
saved without detriment to the individual, will be saved.  Changes of
structure at an early age will generally affect parts subsequently
developed; and there are very many other correlations of growth, the
nature of which we are utterly unable to understand. Multiple parts
are variable in number and in structure, perhaps arising from such
parts not having been closely specialized to any particular function,
so that their modifications have not been closely checked by natural
selection. It is probably from this same cause that organic beings low
in the scale of nature are more variable than those which have their
whole organisation more specialized, and are higher in the scale.
Rudimentary organs, from being useless, will be disregarded by natural
selection, and hence probably are variable. Specific characters
  that is, the characters which have come to differ since the
several species of the same genus branched off from a common parent
  are more variable than generic characters, or those which have
long been inherited, and  have not differed within this
same period. In these remarks we have referred to special parts or
organs being still variable, because they have recently varied and
thus come to differ; but we have also seen in the second Chapter that
the same principle applies to the whole individual; for in a district
where many species of any genus are found   that is, where there
has been much former 
variation and differentiation, or where the
manufactory of new specific forms has been actively at work  
there, on an average, we now find most varieties or incipient species.
Secondary sexual characters are highly variable, and such characters
differ much in the species of the same group. Variability in the same
parts of the organisation has generally been taken advantage of in
giving secondary sexual differences to the sexes of the same species,
and specific differences to the several species of the same genus. Any
part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an
extraordinary manner, in comparison with the same part or organ in the
allied species, must have gone through an extraordinary amount of
modification since the genus arose; and thus we can understand why it
should often still be variable in a much higher degree than other
parts; for variation is a long-continued and slow process, and natural
selection will in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome the
tendency to further variability and to reversion to a less modified
state. But when a species with any extraordinarily-developed organ has
become the parent of many modified descendants   which on my
view must be a very slow process, requiring a long lapse of time
  in this case, natural selection may readily have succeeded in
giving a fixed character to the organ, in however extraordinary a
manner it may be developed. Species inheriting nearly the same
constitution from a common parent and exposed to similar influences
will naturally tend to present analogous variations, and these same
species may occasionally revert to some of the characters of their
ancient progenitors. Although new and important modifications may not
arise from reversion and analogous variation, such modifications will
add to the beautiful and harmonious diversity of nature.

<P>
Whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the
offspring from their parents   and a cause for each must exist
   it is the steady accumulation, through natural
selection, of such differences, when beneficial to the individual,
that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure,
by which the innumerable beings on the face of this earth are enabled
to struggle with each other, and the best adapted to survive.
