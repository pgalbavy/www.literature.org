<P>
THE narrative returns to South Morden, and follows the events
which attended Isabel's marriage engagement.
<P>
To say that Miss Pink, inflated by the triumph, rose, morally
speaking, from the earth and floated among the clouds, is to
indicate faintly the effect produced on the ex-schoolmistress
when her niece first informed her of what had happened at the
farm. Attacked on one side by her aunt, and on the other by
Hardyman, and feebly defended, at the best, by her own doubts and
misgivings, Isabel ended by surrendering at discretion. Like
thousands of other women in a similar position, she was in the
last degree uncertain as to the state of her own heart. To what
extent she was insensibly influenced by Hardyman's commanding
position in believing herself to be sincerely attached to him, it
was beyond her power of self-examination to discover. He doubly
dazzled her by his birth and by his celebrity. Not in England
only, but throughout Europe, he was a recognized authority on his
own subject. How could she-- how could any woman--resist the
influence of his steady mind, his firmness of purpose, his manly
resolution to owe everything to himself and nothing to his rank,
set off as these attractive qualities were by the outward and
personal advantages which exercise an ascendancy of their own?
Isabel was fascinated, and yet Isabel was not at ease. In her
lonely moments she was troubled by regretful thoughts of Moody,
which perplexed and irritated her. She had always behaved
honestly to him; she had never encouraged him to hope that his
love for her had the faintest prospect of being returned. Yet,
knowing, as she did, that her conduct was blameless so far, there
were nevertheless perverse sympathies in her which took his part.
In the wakeful hours of the night there were whispering voices in
her which said: "Think of Moody!" Had there been a growing
kindness towards this good friend in her heart, of which she
herself was not aware? She tried to detect it--to weigh it for
what it was really worth. But it lay too deep to be discovered
and estimated, if it did really exist--if it had any sounder
origin than her own morbid fancy. In the broad light of day, in
the little bustling duties of life, she forgot it again. She
could think of what she ought to wear on the wedding day; she
could even try privately how her new signature, "Isabel
Hardyman," would look when she had the right to use it. On the
whole, it may be said that the time passed smoothly--with some
occasional checks and drawbacks, which were the more easily
endured seeing that they took their rise in Isabel's own conduct.
Compliant as she was in general, there were two instances, among
others, in which her resolution to take her own way was not to be
overcome. She refused to write either to Moody or to Lady Lydiard
informing them of her engagement; and she steadily disapproved of
Miss Pink's policy of concealment, in the matter of the robbery
at Lady Lydiard's house. Her aunt could only secure her as a
passive accomplice by stating family considerations in the
strongest possible terms. "If the disgrace was confined to you,
my dear, I might leave you to decide. But I am involved in it, as
your nearest relative; and, what is more, even the sacred
memories of your father and mother might feel the slur cast on
them." This exaggerated language--like all exaggerated language,
a mischievous weapon in the arsenal of weakness and
prejudice--had its effect on Isabel. Reluctantly and sadly, she
consented to be silent.
<P>
Miss Pink wrote word of the engagement to Moody first; reserving
to a later day the superior pleasure of informing Lady Lydiard of
the very event which that audacious woman had declared to be
impossible. To her aunt's surprise, just as she was about to
close the envelope Isabel stepped forward, and inconsistently
requested leave to add a postscript to the very letter which she
had refused to write! Miss Pink was not even permitted to see the
postscript. Isabel secured the envelope the moment she laid down
her pen, and retired to her room with a headache (which was
heartache in disguise) for the rest of the day.
<P>
While the question of marriage was still in debate, an event
occurred which exercised a serious influence on Hardyman's future
plans.
<P>
He received a letter from the Continent which claimed his
immediate attention. One of the sovereigns of Europe had decided
on making some radical changes in the mounting and equipment of a
cavalry regiment; and he required the assistance of Hardyman in
that important part of the contemplated reform which was
connected with the choice and purchase of horses. Setting his own
interests out of the question, Hardyman owed obligations to the
kindness of his illustrious correspondent which made it
impossible for him to send an excuse. In a fortnight's time, at
the latest, it would be necessary for him to leave England; and a
month or more might elapse before it would be possible for him to
return.
<P>
Under these circumstances, he proposed, in his own precipitate
way, to hasten the date of the marriage. The necessary legal
delay would permit the ceremony to be performed on that day
fortnight. Isabel might then accompany him on his journey, and
spend a brilliant honeymoon at the foreign Court. She at once
refused, not only to accept his proposal, but even to take it
into consideration. While Miss Pink dwelt eloquently on the
shortness of the notice, Miss Pink's niece based her resolution
on far more important grounds. Hardyman had not yet announced the
contemplated marriage to his parents and friends; and Isabel was
determined not to become his wife until she could be first
assured of a courteous and tolerant reception by the family--if
she could hope for no warmer welcome at their hands.
<P>
Hardyman was not a man who yielded easily, even in trifles. In
the present case, his dearest interests were concerned in
inducing Isabel to reconsider her decision. He was still vainly
trying to shake her resolution, when the afternoon post brought a
letter for Miss Pink which introduced a new element of
disturbance into the discussion. The letter was nothing less than
Lady Lydiard's reply to the written announcement of Isabel's
engagement, despatched on the previous day by Miss Pink.
<P>
Her Ladyship's answer was a surprisingly short one. It only
contained these lines:
<P>
"Lady Lydiard begs to acknowledge the receipt of Miss Pink's
letter requesting that she will say nothing to Mr. Hardyman of
the loss of a bank-note in her house, and, assigning as a reason
that Miss Isabel Miller is engaged to be married to Mr. Hardyman,
and might be prejudiced in his estimation if the facts were made
known. Miss Pink may make her mind easy. Lady Lydiard had not the
slightest intention of taking Mr. Hardyman into her confidence on
the subject of her domestic affairs. With regard to the proposed
marriage, Lady Lydiard casts no doubt on Miss Pink's perfect
sincerity and good faith; but, at the same time, she positively
declines to believe that Mr. Hardyman means to make Miss Isabel
Miller his wife. Lady L. will yield to the evidence of a
properly-attested certificate--and to nothing else."
<P>
<P>
A folded piece of paper, directed to Isabel, dropped out of this
characteristic letter as Miss Pink turned from the first page to
the second. Lady Lydiard addressed her adopted daughter in these
words:
<P>
"I was on the point of leaving home to visit you again, when I
received your aunt's letter. My poor deluded child, no words can
tell how distressed I am about you. You are already sacrificed to
the folly of the most foolish woman living. For God's sake, take
care you do not fall a victim next to the designs of a profligate
man. Come to me instantly, Isabel, and I promise to take care of
you."
<P>
Fortified by these letters, and aided by Miss Pink's indignation,
Hardyman pressed his proposal on Isabel with renewed resolution.
She made no attempt to combat his arguments--she only held firmly
to her decision. Without some encouragement from Hardyman's
father and mother she still steadily refused to become his wife.
Irritated already by Lady Lydiard's letters, he lost the
self-command which so eminently distinguished him in the ordinary
affairs of life, and showed the domineering and despotic temper
which was an inbred part of his disposition. Isabel's high spirit
at once resented the harsh terms in which he spoke to her. In the
plainest words, she released him from his engagement, and,
without waiting for his excuses, quitted the room.
<P>
Left together, Hardyman and Miss Pink devised an arrangement
which paid due respect to Isabel's scruples, and at the same time
met Lady Lydiard's insulting assertion of disbelief in Hardyman's
honor, by a formal and public announcement of the marriage.
<P>
It was proposed to give a garden party at the farm in a week's
time for the express purpose of introducing Isabel to Hardyman's
family and friends in the character of his betrothed wife. If his
father and mother accepted the invitation, Isabel's only
objection to hastening the union would fall to the ground.
Hardyman might, in that case, plead with his Imperial
correspondent for a delay in his departure of a few days more;
and th e marriage might still take place before he left England.
Isabel, at Miss Pink's intercession, was induced to accept her
lover's excuses, and, in the event of her favorable reception by
Hardyman's parents at the farm, to give her consent (not very
willingly even yet) to hastening the ceremony which was to make
her Hardyman's wife.
<P>
On the next morning the whole of the invitations were sent out,
excepting the invitation to Hardyman's father and mother. Without
mentioning it to Isabel, Hardyman decided on personally appealing
to his mother before he ventured on taking the head of the family
into his confidence.
<P>
The result of the interview was partially successful--and no
more. Lord Rotherfield declined to see his youngest son; and he
had engagements which would, under any circumstances, prevent his
being present at the garden party. But at the express request of
Lady Rotherfield, he was willing to make certain concessions.
<P>
"I have always regarded Alfred as a barely sane person," said his
Lordship, "since he turned his back on his prospects to become a
horse dealer. If we decline altogether to sanction this new
act--I won't say, of insanity, I will say, of absurdity--on his
part, it is impossible to predict to what discreditable
extremities he may not proceed. We must temporise with Alfred. In
the meantime I shall endeavor to obtain some information
respecting this young person--named Miller, I think you said, and
now resident at South Morden. If I am satisfied that she is a
woman of reputable character, possessing an average education and
presentable manners, we may as well let Alfred take his own way.
He is out of the pale of Society, as it is; and Miss Miller has
no father and mother to complicate matters, which is distinctly a
merit on her part and, in short, if the marriage is not
absolutely disgraceful, the wisest way (as we have no power to
prevent it) will be to submit. You will say nothing to Alfred
about what I propose to do. I tell you plainly I don't trust him.
You will simply inform him from me that I want time to consider,
and that, unless he hears to the contrary in the interval, he may
expect to have the sanction of your presence at his breakfast, or
luncheon, or whatever it is. I must go to town in a day or two,
and I shall ascertain what Alfred's friends know about this last
of his many follies, if I meet any of them at the club."
<P>
Returning to South Morden in no serene frame of mind, Hardyman
found Isabel in a state of depression which perplexed and alarmed
him.
<P>
The news that his mother might be expected to be present at the
garden party failed entirely to raise her spirits. The only
explanation she gave of the change in her was, that the dull
heavy weather of the last few days made her feel a little languid
and nervous. Naturally dissatisfied with this reply to his
inquiries, Hardyman asked for Miss Pink. He was informed that
Miss Pink could not see him. She was constitutionally subject to
asthma, and, having warnings of the return of the malady, she was
(by the doctor's advice) keeping her room. Hardyman returned to
the farm in a temper which was felt by everybody in his
employment, from the trainer to the stable-boys.
<P>
While the apology made for Miss Pink stated no more than the
plain truth, it must be confessed that Hardyman was right in
declining to be satisfied with Isabel's excuse for the melancholy
that oppressed her. She had that morning received Moody's answer
to the lines which she had addressed to him at the end of her
aunt's letter; and she had not yet recovered from the effect
which it had produced on her spirits.
<P>
"It is impossible for me to say honestly that I am not distressed
(Moody wrote) by the news of your marriage engagement. The blow
has fallen very heavily on me. When I look at the future now, I
see only a dreary blank. This is not your fault--you are in no
way to blame. I remember the time when I should have been too
angry to own this--when I might have said or done things which I
should have bitterly repented afterwards. That time is past. My
temper has been softened, since I have befriended you in your
troubles. That good at least has come out of my foolish hopes,
and perhaps out of the true sympathy which I have felt for you. I
can honestly ask you to accept my heart's dearest wishes for your
happiness--and I can keep the rest to myself.
<P>
"Let me say a word now relating to the efforts that I have made
to help you, since that sad day when you left Lady Lydiard's
house.
<P>
"I had hoped (for reasons which it is needless to mention here)
to interest Mr. Hardyman himself in aiding our inquiry. But your
aunt's wishes, as expressed in her letter to me, close my lips. I
will only beg you, at some convenient time, to let me mention the
last discoveries that we have made; leaving it to your
discretion, when Mr. Hardyman has become your husband, to ask him
the questions which, under other circumstances, I should have put
to him myself.
<P>
"It is, of course, possible that the view I take of Mr.
Hardyman's capacity to help us may be a mistaken one. In this
case, if you still wish the investigation to be privately carried
on, I entreat you to let me continue to direct it, as the
greatest favor you can confer on your devoted old friend.
<P>
"You need be under no apprehension about the expense to which you
are likely to put me. I have unexpectedly inherited what is to me
a handsome fortune.
<P>
"The same post which brought your aunt's letter brought a line
from a lawyer asking me to see him on the subject of my late
father's affairs. I waited a day or two before I could summon
heart enough to see him, or to see anybody; and then I went to
his office. You have heard that my father's bank stopped payment,
at a time of commercial panic. His failure was mainly
attributable to the treachery of a friend to whom he had lent a
large sum of money, and who paid him the yearly interest, without
acknowledging that every farthing of it had been lost in
unsuccessful speculations. The son of this man has prospered in
business, and he has honorably devoted a part of his wealth to
the payment of his father's creditors. Half the sum due to _my_
father has thus passed into my hands as his next of kin; and the
other half is to follow in course of time. If my hopes had been
fulfilled, how gladly I should have shared my prosperity with
you! As it is, I have far more than enough for my wants as a
lonely man, and plenty left to spend in your service.
<P>
"God bless and prosper you, my dear. I shall ask you to accept a
little present from me, among the other offerings that are made
to you before the wedding day.-- R.M."
<P>
<P>
The studiously considerate and delicate tone in which these lines
were written had an effect on Isabel which was exactly the
opposite of the effect intended by the writer. She burst into a
passionate fit of tears; and in the safe solitude of her own
room, the despairing words escaped her, "I wish I had died before
I met with Alfred Hardyman!"
<P>
As the days wore on, disappointments and difficulties seemed by a
kind of fatality to beset the contemplated announcement of the
marriage.
<P>
Miss Pink's asthma, developed by the unfavorable weather, set the
doctor's art at defiance, and threatened to keep that unfortunate
lady a prisoner in her room on the day of the party. Hardyman's
invitations were in some cases refused; and in others accepted by
husbands with excuses for the absence of their wives. His elder
brother made an apology for himself as well as for his wife.
Felix Sweetsir wrote, "With pleasure, dear Alfred, if my health
permits me to leave the house." Lady Lydiard, invited at Miss
Pink's special request, sent no reply. The one encouraging
circumstance was the silence of Lady Rotherfield. So long as her
son received no intimation to the contrary, it was a sign that
Lord Rotherfield permitted his wife to sanction the marriage by
her presence.
<P>
Hardyman wrote to his Imperial correspondent, engaging to leave
England on the earliest possible day, and asking to be pardoned
if he failed to express himself more definitely, in consideration
of domestic affairs, which it was necessary to settle before he
started  for the Continent. I f there should not be time enough to
write again, he promised to send a telegraphic announcement of
his departure. Long afterwards, Hardyman remembered the
misgivings that had troubled him when he wrote that letter. In
the rough draught of it, he had mentioned, as his excuse for not
being yet certain of his own movements, that he expected to be
immediately married. In the fair copy, the vague foreboding of
some accident to come was so painfully present to his mind, that
he struck out the words which referred to his marriage, and
substituted the designedly indefinite phrase, "domestic affairs."
