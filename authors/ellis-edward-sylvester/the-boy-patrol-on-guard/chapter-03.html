<p>The reply to Mike’s hail was so prompt that he thought it was
the echo of his own voice. He looked in the direction whence the
answer came, and, seeing nothing to account for it, shouted:</p>

<p>"I obsarved ‘Hello!’ and I take it kindly that ye did the same,"
and he added to himself: "Now, Mr. Echo, let me see what ye can
do with them words."</p>

<p>The response was unexpected and startling. Nothing was heard,
but a man came into sight among the pines and walked with slow,
steady step straight toward the astonished lad, his keen eyes
fixed inquiringly upon the youth, as if uncertain of his nature.</p>

<p>The person was tall, thin, slightly stoop-shouldered and certainly
well past the age of three-score and ten. His straggling hair
and abundant beard, which descended over his chest like a fleecy
veil, were as white as snow. The nose was well formed, inclined
to Roman, and his gray eyes under the shaggy grizzled brows were
of piercing intensity. He grasped a long crooked staff in his
right hand, the top rising a foot above his head, and used the
stick for a cane in walking. He wore no hat or covering of any
kind for his crown, but his attire was a suggestion of a Norfolk
coat such as Scout Masters wear. It was buttoned down the front
and closed about the waist by a girdle or belt of the same material,
which was olive-drab cotton cloth, with two pleats before and
behind. Although the garment was well worn it was clean and unfrayed.
The trousers of the same kind of cloth reached to the top of the
coarse, strong shoes. Under the coat was a dark flannel shirt,
though it scarcely showed because of the closed garment and the
beard curtain.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he intends to walk over me," mused Mike, as he met
the steady gaze and held his position; "it looks that way."</p>

<p>A half dozen paces away, however, the old man abruptly halted,
stared and remained silent. Mike raised his hand and made a military
salute.</p>

<p>"With me compliments and best wishes and many of the same."</p>

<p>"Try that again, young man," said the stranger in a mellow voice,
"you didn’t do it properly."</p>

<p>"I did the best I know how," replied the astonished Mike, "and
I was thinking it couldn’t be much improved upon."</p>

<p>"None the less it is wrong."</p>

<p>"If ye’ll be after insthructing me it’s mesilf that will try
to do you justice."</p>

<p>"Are you not a Boy Scout?"</p>

<p>"Not just yit, though I’m hoping to honor the Scouts by allowing
the same to put my name on their roll."</p>

<p>"Why then do you wear their uniform?"</p>

<p>"Would ye have me take it off and wear the rigimintals I was
born in? I’d be feared of the scratches from the bushes, though
I should like to be obliging."</p>

<p>"Are you on your way to the Boy Patrol camp?"</p>

<p>"That’s me distination, as me uncle said whin he looked down
at the ground as he was falling from a balloon."</p>

<p>"You are walking away from instead of toward it. The Boy Patrols
are two miles to the rear."</p>

<p>"I don’t wish to drop down on ’em too quick; ye have heard of
sudden joy killing a person and I want to approach ’em slow and
grand like, that they may have time to give me a proper reciption."</p>

<p>Fearing that his jocosity might not be acceptable, Mike added:</p>

<p>"I may as well own up, me friend, that I’ve lost me way, but
before going thither will ye insthruct me as to how to make the
Boy Scout salute?"</p>

<p>"It is simple; observe; crook your right little finger inward;
keep it down flat by pressing your thumb upon it; hold the other
three fingers upright, palm outward and bring the hand in front
of the forehead; try it."</p>

<p>With the example before him, Mike had no trouble in making the
salute.</p>

<p>"That is right; so long as you wear the uniform of the Boy Scouts,
and since as you say you expect to become one of them, you must
use their method of greeting one another."</p>

<p>"And now will ye put me under bigger obligations by showing me
the exact coorse to folly to reach the camp of me friends?"</p>

<p>The old man raised his staff from the ground and pointed to the
left of the lad.</p>

<p>"If you will hold to that direction, you will go straight to
them."</p>

<p>"Now that ye have told me I won’t furgit it."</p>

<p>"All the same you will; you know so little about the woods that
you will be lost before you have gone a fourth of the distance."</p>

<p>"How can I do that wid such plain instructions as ye have given
me?"</p>

<p>"Were you not directed before you set out for your friends’ camp?"</p>

<p>"But not by such an intilligent gintleman as yersilf."</p>

<p>The twitching of the beard at the side of the old man’s mouth
showed that he was pleased by the whimsical compliment.</p>

<p>"It is easy to see from your blarney that you were born in Ireland:
what is your name?"</p>

<p>"Mike Murphy; me father, Mr. Patrick Murphy, has charge of Mr.
Landon’s bungalow on Southport Island, where I make me home wid
him whin I’m not living somewhere ilse. ’Twas his boy Alvin that
sint fur me to jine the Boy Patrols on Gosling Lake."</p>

<p>"I called there yesterday and spent most of the day with them.
They are a fine set of youths and have an admirable Scout Master;
I expect soon to see them again; the troop, as it is called, numbers
three Patrols, that of Mr. Hall, the Scout Master, being the Blazing
Arrow."</p>

<p>"Ye said there were three Patrols in the troop: what are the
ithers?"</p>

<p>"The Stag and the Eagle. Now it has occurred to me, Michael,
that since you expect to join the Boy Patrols and know comparatively
nothing of them, it will be wise for you to go to my home, which
isn’t far off, and spend the night with me; I’ll teach you enough,
not only to pass a good examination but to astonish the other
Scouts by your knowledge."</p>

<p>This offer brought out the question that had been in the mind
of Mike for some minutes:</p>

<p>"Ye are very kind and I’m thankful for the invitation, but may
I ask who ye are?"</p>

<p>"That is your right, since you have already introduced yourself.
My name is Elkanah Sisum, more generally called ‘Uncle Elk’; a
long time ago a great sorrow came to me; it drove me into the
woods, where I put up a cabin and have lived for fifteen years;
but I have not lost my love for my fellow men and especially for
boys; I can never look upon a youth like yourself without being
awed by the infinite possibilities for good or evil slumbering
in him, and my heart yearns to help all along the right path."</p>

<p>"How is it ye know so much about the Boy Scouts of America?"</p>

<p>"Living by myself, I spend a good deal of time in hunting, fishing
and cultivating the little patch of ground on which my cabin stands,
but I find leisure for reading and study. I became interested
a year ago in the accounts of the Boy Scout movement, which owes
so much to Lieutenant-General Sir Robert S. S. Baden-Powell of
England. I should be stupid indeed to pass so many years in the
wilderness without learning woodcraft, campcraft, trailing and
the ways of the woods."</p>

<p>Mike had set his heart on joining his friends that day—for you
know he had been tardy in following directions and Alvin and Chester
would be disturbed over his failure to show up—and the distance
was so short that he could easily traverse it before night. With
the confidence of youth, he felt no fear of losing his way, despite
the assertion of Uncle Elk. But the presentation of the case appealed
strongly to him. He had a natural dread of going into the Boy
Patrol camp as the champion ignoramus of the party. Alvin and
Chester would have rare sport with him, for they knew only too
well what he would do had the situations been reversed. But to
stride among them with the proper salute, which he knew already,
and, when subjected to the preliminary examination, to pass triumphantly
would be an achievement which would make his blood tingle with
pride.</p>

<p>What a lucky stroke of fortune it was that in losing his way
in the woods he had met Uncle Elk, whose language showed him to
be a man of culture and qualified to give him the very instruction
he needed. The incident was another illustration of the truth
that many a misfortune is a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p>"I thank ye very kindly," said Mike, with hardly a moment’s hesitation;
"I shall be glad to spend the night in yer home."</p>

<p>"Come on then; darkness is not far off and it is quite a walk
to my cabin. I make one condition, Michael."</p>

<p>"I’m listening."</p>

<p>"You must bring a good appetite with you; I have no princely
fare to offer, but it is substantial."</p>

<p>"It would be ongrateful fur me to disapp’int ye, and ye may make
sartin that ye shall not be graived in that respict." </p>
