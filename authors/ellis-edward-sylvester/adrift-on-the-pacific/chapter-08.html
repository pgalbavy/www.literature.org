<p>It was certainly very wonderful that little Inez Hawthorne should
have been transferred from the steamer to the schooner, and that
many hours should have passed before the discovery was made by
the respective captains of the craft.</p>

<p>Yet such was the fact, and Captain Bergen and Mate Storms had
no sooner learned the real situation than Hyde Brazzier was sent
for to tell how it occurred. As he was the one who rowed the small
boat, there could be no doubt that he knew. The story he told
was the true one, with the exception of the supplement&mdash;that he
actually forgot about the little girl after she went into the
cabin and fell asleep.</p>

<p>It was impossible, it may be said, that such could be the fact,
and the officers looked knowingly at each other. They knew he
was falsifying, but they made no comment, except to declare that
she must be taken back to the steamer without an hour's delay.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen learned from Inez that she had no relatives on
board the steamer, and she did not show any special distress over
being where she was. But, for all that, the honest New Englander
felt that she should be restored, and he immediately took every
means for doing so.</p>

<p>His supposition was that she would be speedily missed from the
<em>Polynesia</em>, which would at once make search for the schooner.
Accordingly, the <em>Coral</em> was headed northwest, under all
sail, the sun just rising at the time this change of course was
made.</p>

<p>"The steamer will go so much faster than we," said the captain,
"that there is no possibility of overhauling her, unless her shaft
should give out again."</p>

<p>"There's no danger of that. More likely she'll turn about and
look for us."</p>

<p>As the sun climbed the heavens, the horizon was anxiously scanned
for some point where the black column of a steamer's smokestack
could be seen staining the clear sky. Far away to the northward,
a vapor was observed, which at first was set down as the sight
for which they were searching; but it was soon learned that it
was a peculiarly-formed cloud, resting almost upon the water.</p>

<p>The upper rigging and sails of possibly an American whaler were
descried a long distance to the northward, and a full-rigged ship
was detected closer in, and further to the eastward. But no sign
of the <em>Polynesia</em> was discovered through the powerful
binocular glasses with which Captain Bergen swept the horizon.
There was strong hope, in spite of this, that she would be seen
before sunset, and the <em>Coral</em> held to her course toward
the southwest, not only for that day and night, but for the two
succeeding ones. But it is useless to dwell upon the search made
by the smaller vessel, which was without the faintest glimmer
of success.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen and Mate Storms did their utmost to undo the wrong
act of their sailors, but at the end of the third day they held
an anxious consultation as to what was the right course left to
pursue. They had given up hope of meeting the <em>Polynesia</em>
except by chasing her all the way to Japan, they having learned
that Tokio was her destination.</p>

<p>Should the <em>Coral</em> follow her there, or first fulfil its
own destiny in the Paumotu Islands? This was the all-important
matter to be settled.</p>

<p>When a man makes a great invention or discovery, his first dread
is that some one else will anticipate him and gather to himself
all the glory and profit. This had been a constant fear in the
case of the captain and mate of the schooner <em>Coral</em> ever
since they began their preparations for the journey to the South
Seas. It cost them a pang of dread when, therefore, they headed
the schooner about in the hunt for the steamer, for, as will be
readily understood, the apprehension of which we have spoken intensifies
the nearer one gets to the goal.</p>

<p>There were other considerations which entered into the question
as to whether they should go on or turn about. Inez Hawthorne
had, as might have been expected, adapted herself to her new position
as passenger on the schooner, and ran hither and thither at will,
just as she did on the <em>Polynesia</em>, and she climbed all
over the captain and mate, as if they were Captain Strathmore
and his officer, or some of the passengers.</p>

<p>She occasionally expressed a longing to see the grizzled old
sea-captain, whom she called her second, or new "papa," but there
was no one else for whom she particularly longed. Her affection
was distributed so equally and spontaneously that among several
hundred it could not be very profound. Only in the case of the
brave old Captain Strathmore was it deep and steadfast.</p>

<p>It would delay the voyage to the Pearl Islands not for weeks,
but for months, to sail away to Asia, and then turn about and
put back to the southern seas, and during that interval what might
not take place? What assurance could there be that the precious
pearl-bed would not be devastated?</p>

<p>With the plans which Abe Storms had perfected on the way from
home, it was believed that a week's time after their arrival at
their destination would be sufficient to make them enormously
wealthy, and thus the voyage which they would afterward take to
Japan would be delayed only a month or two, perhaps. Furthermore,
the parents and friends of Inez would have every reason to believe
she was in safe hands, and would soon be restored to them. All
these were weighty considerations, it must be confessed, and they
decided the question.</p>

<p>"We have done all that can be done," said Captain Bergen, standing
at the stern with his hand upon the wheel, while Abe Storms, thoughtfully
smoking his pipe, was at his elbow, with his arms folded and his
eyes gazing dreamily toward the western horizon, where the sun
was about to dip into the ocean.</p>

<p>"I agree with you," was the reply of his mate, who was as conscientious
in everything he did as was the captain. "I consider that the
chance is as one in a thousand that we shall meet the steamer
this side of Tokio, and if we undertake to follow, we shall lose
several months of most precious time, without accomplishing any
commensurate good. The child is contented and happy here."</p>

<p>As if to emphasize this assertion, the laugh of Inez was heard
at that moment as she came bounding up the steps of the cabin,
and ran toward the bow, where the giant negro, Pomp, was leaning
against the gunwale, his arms also folded, and an expression of
contentment upon his broad, shiny countenance.</p>

<p>The instant he caught sight of Inez his face lighted up and his
white, even teeth were displayed with pleasure, as she ran toward
him.</p>

<p>It was singular, indeed, that, ever since her first awaking on
board the <em>Coral</em>, Inez had shown not a positive dislike
of Redvig and Brazzier, but what may be called a lack of friendship
toward them. She was trusting and loving to Pomp and the two officers,
but it was evident that she avoided the others. Possibly she could
not have told the reason had she tried, and it is equally possible
that she was not aware of it herself. But every one else on board
saw it plainly.</p>

<p>When two men in authority talk as did the captain and mate of
the schooner <em>Coral</em>, the conclusion is inevitable. The
decision was made to go on to the Paumotu Islands, after which
the voyage would be made to Japan, and, alas! that it was so.</p>
