<p>Mr. McBryde, the District Superintendent of Police, was the most
reflective and best educated of the Chandrapore officials. He had
read and thought a good deal, and, owing to a somewhat unhappy
marriage, had evolved a complete philosophy of life. There was much
of the cynic about him, but nothing of the bully; he never lost
his temper or grew rough, and he received Aziz with courtesy, was
almost reassuring. “I have to detain you until you get bail,” he
said, “but no doubt your friends will be applying for it, and of
course they will be allowed to visit you, under regulations. I am
given certain information, and have to act on it—I’m not your
judge.” Aziz was led off weeping. Mr. McBryde was shocked at his
downfall, but no Indian ever surprised him, because he had a theory
about climatic zones. The theory ran: “All unfortunate natives are
criminals at heart, for the simple reason that they live south of
latitude 30. They are not to blame, they have not a dog’s chance—we
should be like them if we settled here.” Born at Karachi, he seemed
to contradict his theory, and would sometimes admit as much with
a sad, quiet smile.
</p>
<p>“Another of them found out,” he thought, as he set to work to draft
his statement to the Magistrate.
</p><p>He was interrupted by the arrival of Fielding.
</p><p>He imparted all he knew without reservations. Miss Derek had
herself driven in the Mudkul car about an hour ago, she and Miss
Quested both in a terrible state. They had gone straight to his
bungalow where he happened to be, and there and then he had taken
down the charge and arranged for the arrest at the railway station.
</p><p>“What is the charge, precisely?”
</p><p>“That he followed her into the cave and made insulting advances.
She hit at him with her field-glasses; he pulled at them and the
strap broke, and that is how she got away. When we searched him
just now, they were in his pocket.”
</p><p>“Oh no, oh no, no; it’ll be cleared up in five minutes,” he cried
again.
</p><p>“Have a look at them.”
</p><p>The strap had been newly broken, the eye-piece was jammed. The
logic of evidence said “Guilty.”
</p><p>“Did she say any more?”
</p><p>“There was an echo that appears to have frightened her. Did you go
into those caves?”
</p><p>“I saw one of them. There was an echo. Did it get on her nerves?”
</p><p>“I couldn’t worry her overmuch with questions. She’ll have plenty
to go through in the witness-box. They don’t bear thinking about,
these next weeks. I wish the Marabar Hills and all they contain
were at the bottom of the sea. Evening after evening one saw them
from the club, and they were just a harmless name. . . . Yes, we
start already.” For a visiting card was brought; Vakil Mahmoud Ali,
legal adviser to the prisoner, asked to be allowed to see him.
McBryde sighed, gave permission, and continued: “I heard some more
from Miss Derek—she is an old friend of us both and talks freely;
well—her account is that you went off to locate the camp, and
almost at once she heard stones falling on the Kawa Dol and saw
Miss Quested running straight down the face of a precipice. Well.
She climbed up a sort of gully to her, and found her practically
done for—her helmet off——”
</p><p>“Was a guide not with her?” interrupted Fielding.
</p><p>“No. She had got among some cactuses. Miss Derek saved her life
coming just then—she was beginning to fling herself about. She
helped her down to the car. Miss Quested couldn’t stand the Indian
driver, cried, ‘Keep him away’—and it was that that put our friend
on the track of what had happened. They made straight for our
bungalow, and are there now. That’s the story as far as I know it
yet. She sent the driver to join you. I think she behaved with
great sense.”
</p><p>“I suppose there’s no possibility of my seeing Miss Quested?” he
asked suddenly.
</p><p>“I hardly think that would do. Surely.”
</p><p>“I was afraid you’ld say that. I should very much like to.”
</p><p>“She is in no state to see anyone. Besides, you don’t know her
well.”
</p><p>“Hardly at all. . . . But you see I believe she’s under some
hideous delusion, and that that wretched boy is innocent.”
</p><p>The policeman started in surprise, and a shadow passed over his
face, for he could not bear his dispositions to be upset. “I had
no idea that was in your mind,” he said, and looked for support at
the signed deposition, which lay before him.
</p><p>“Those field-glasses upset me for a minute, but I’ve thought since:
it’s impossible that, having attempted to assault her, he would
put her glasses into his pocket.”
</p><p>“Quite possible, I’m afraid; when an Indian goes bad, he goes not
only very bad, but very queer.”
</p><p>“I don’t follow.”
</p><p>“How should you? When you think of crime you think of English
crime. The psychology here is different. I dare say you’ll tell me
next that he was quite normal when he came down from the hill to
greet you. No reason he should not be. Read any of the Mutiny
records; which, rather than the Bhagavad Gita, should be your Bible
in this country. Though I’m not sure that the one and the other
are not closely connected. Am I not being beastly? But, you see,
Fielding, as I’ve said to you once before, you’re a schoolmaster,
and consequently you come across these people at their best. That’s
what puts you wrong. They can be charming as boys. But I know them
as they really are, after they have developed into men. Look at
this, for instance.” He held up Aziz’ pocket-case. “I am going
through the contents. They are not edifying. Here is a letter from
a friend who apparently keeps a brothel.”
</p><p>“I don’t want to hear his private letters.”
</p><p>“It’ll have to be quoted in Court, as bearing on his morals. He
was fixing up to see women at Calcutta.”
</p><p>“Oh, that’ll do, that’ll do.”
</p><p>McBryde stopped, naively puzzled. It was obvious to him that any
two sahibs ought to pool all they knew about any Indian, and he
could not think where the objection came in.
</p><p>“I dare say you have the right to throw stones at a young man for
doing that, but I haven’t. I did the same at his age.”
</p><p>So had the Superintendent of Police, but he considered that the
conversation had taken a turn that was undesirable. He did not like
Fielding’s next remark either.
</p><p>“Miss Quested really cannot be seen? You do know that for a
certainty?”
</p><p>“You have never explained to me what’s in your mind here. Why on
earth do you want to see her?”
</p><p>“On the off chance of her recanting before you send in that report
and he’s committed for trial, and the whole thing goes to blazes.
Old man, don’t argue about this, but do of your goodness just ring
up your wife or Miss Derek and enquire. It’ll cost you nothing.”
</p><p>“It’s no use ringing up them,” he replied, stretching out for the
telephone. “Callendar settles a question like that, of course. You
haven’t grasped that she’s seriously ill.”
</p><p>“He’s sure to refuse, it’s all he exists for,” said the other
desperately.
</p><p>The expected answer came back: the Major would not hear of the
patient being troubled.
</p><p>“I only wanted to ask her whether she is certain, dead certain,
that it was Aziz who followed her into the cave.”
</p><p>“Possibly my wife might ask her that much.”
</p><p>“But _I_ wanted to ask her. I want someone who believes in him to
ask her.”
</p><p>“What difference does that make?”
</p><p>“She is among people who disbelieve in Indians.”
</p><p>“Well, she tells her own story, doesn’t she?”
</p><p>“I know, but she tells it to you.”
</p><p>McBryde raised his eyebrows, murmuring: “A bit too finespun.
Anyhow, Callendar won’t hear of you seeing her. I’m sorry to say
he gave a bad account just now. He says that she is by no means
out of danger.”
</p><p>They were silent. Another card was brought into the
office—Hamidullah’s. The opposite army was gathering.
</p><p>“I must put this report through now, Fielding.”
</p><p>“I wish you wouldn’t.”
</p><p>“How can I not?”
</p><p>“I feel that things are rather unsatisfactory as well as most
disastrous. We are heading for a most awful smash. I can see your
prisoner, I suppose.”
</p><p>He hesitated. “His own people seem in touch with him all right.”
</p><p>“Well, when he’s done with them.”
</p><p>“I wouldn’t keep you waiting; good heavens, you take precedence of
any Indian visitor, of course. I meant what’s the good. Why mix
yourself up with pitch?”
</p><p>“I say he’s innocent——”
</p><p>“Innocence or guilt, why mix yourself up? What’s the good?”
</p><p>“Oh, good, good,” he cried, feeling that every earth was being
stopped. “One’s got to breathe occasionally, at least I have. I
mayn’t see her, and now I mayn’t see him. I promised him to come
up here with him to you, but Turton called me off before I could
get two steps.”
</p><p>“Sort of all-white thing the Burra Sahib would do,” he muttered
sentimentally. And trying not to sound patronizing, he stretched
his hand over the table, and said: “We shall all have to hang
together, old man, I’m afraid. I’m your junior in years, I know,
but very much your senior in service; you don’t happen to know this
poisonous country as well as I do, and you must take it from me
that the general situation is going to be nasty at Chandrapore
during the next few weeks, very nasty indeed.”
</p><p>“So I have just told you.”
</p><p>“But at a time like this there’s no room for—well—personal views.
The man who doesn’t toe the line is lost.”
</p><p>“I see what you mean.”
</p><p>“No, you don’t see entirely. He not only loses himself, he weakens
his friends. If you leave the line, you leave a gap in the line.
These jackals”—he pointed at the lawyers’ cards—“are looking with
all their eyes for a gap.”
</p><p>“Can I visit Aziz?” was his answer.
</p><p>“No.” Now that he knew of Turton’s attitude, the policeman had no
doubts. “You may see him on a magistrate’s order, but on my own
responsibility I don’t feel justified. It might lead to more
complications.”
</p><p>He paused, reflecting that if he had been either ten years younger
or ten years longer in India, he would have responded to McBryde’s
appeal. The bit between his teeth, he then said, “To whom do I
apply for an order?”
</p><p>“City Magistrate.”
</p><p>“That sounds comfortable!”
</p><p>“Yes, one can’t very well worry poor Heaslop.”
</p><p>More “evidence” appeared at this moment—the table-drawer from Aziz’
bungalow, borne with triumph in a corporal’s arms.
</p><p>“Photographs of women. Ah!”
</p><p>“That’s his wife,” said Fielding, wincing.
</p><p>“How do you know that?”
</p><p>“He told me.”
</p><p>McBryde gave a faint, incredulous smile, and started rummaging in
the drawer. His face became inquisitive and slightly bestial. “Wife
indeed, I know those wives!” he was thinking. Aloud he said: “Well,
you must trot off now, old man, and the Lord help us, the Lord help
us all. . .”
</p><p>As if his prayer had been heard, there was a sudden rackety-dacket
on a temple bell.
