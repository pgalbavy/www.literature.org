<p>Reddy Woodpecker had a very good reason for not laughing when he met
Solomon Owl. Of course, he knew nothing whatever of Solomon’s new hiding
place in the haystack. And that very morning Reddy had invited a party of
friends to go with him to the hemlock grove where Solomon Owl had always
lived, “to have some fun,” as Reddy had explained.
</p>
<p>For a long time he had knocked and hammered and pounded at Solomon Owl’s
door. But for once Solomon’s great pale face did not appear.
</p><p>“Where’s the fun?” Reddy’s friends had wanted to know, after they had
waited until they were impatient.
</p><p>And Reddy Woodpecker could only shake his head and say:
</p><p>“I can’t understand it! It’s never happened like this before. I’m afraid
Solomon Owl has lost his hearing.”
</p><p>Reddy Woodpecker’s friends were no more polite than he. And they began to
jeer at him.
</p><p>“You didn’t hammer loud enough,” one of them told him.
</p><p>So he set to work again and rapped and rapped until his head felt as if it
would fly off, and his neck began to ache.
</p><p>Still, Solomon Owl did not appear. And the party broke up in something
very like a quarrel. For Reddy Woodpecker lost his temper when his friends
teased him; and a good many unpleasant remarks passed back and forth.
</p><p>Somehow, Reddy felt that it was all Solomon Owl’s fault, because he hadn’t
come to the door.
</p><p>Of course, Reddy had no means of knowing that all that time Solomon Owl
was sleeping peacefully in Farmer Green’s haystack in the meadow, a
quarter of a mile away.
</p><p>It was a good joke on Reddy Woodpecker. And though no one had told Solomon
Owl about it, he was not so stupid that he couldn’t guess at least <u>a
little</u> that had happened.
</p>
<p>Solomon Owl continued to have a very pleasant time living in the meadow.
Since there were many mice right close at hand, little by little he
visited the woods less and less. And there came a time at last when he
hardly left the meadow at all.
</p><p>Not flying any more than he could help, and eating too much, and sleeping
very soundly each day, he grew stouter than ever, until his friends hardly
knew him when they saw him.
</p><p>“Solomon Owl is a sight—he’s so fat!” people began to say.
</p><p>But his size never worried Solomon Owl in the least. When he became too
big for his doorway in the haystack, it was a simple matter to make the
opening larger—much simpler than it would have been to make himself
<u>smaller</u>. And that was another reason why he was delighted with his new
home.
</p><p>At last, however, something happened to put an end to his lazy way of
living. One day the sound of men’s voices awakened him, when he was having
a good nap in the haystack. And he felt his bedroom quiver as if an
earthquake had shaken it.
</p><p>Scrambling to his doorway and peeping slyly out, Solomon saw a sight that
made him very angry. A hayrack stood alongside the stack; and on it stood
Farmer Green and his hired man. Each had a pitchfork in his hands, with
which he tore great forkfuls of hay off the stack and piled it upon the
wagon.
</p><p>Solomon Owl knew then that his fine hiding place was going to be spoiled.
As soon as the horses had pulled the load of hay away, with Farmer Green
and the hired man riding on top of it, Solomon Owl crept out of his snug
bedroom and hurried off to the woods.
</p><p>He was so fat that it was several days before he could squeeze inside his
old home in the hollow hemlock. And for the time being he had to sit on a
limb and sleep in the daylight as best he could.
</p><p>But to his surprise, Reddy Woodpecker troubled him no more.  Reddy had
drummed so hard on Solomon’s door, in the effort to awake him when he
wasn’t there, that Aunt Polly Woodchuck told him he would ruin his bill,
if he didn’t look out. And since the warning thoroughly alarmed him, Reddy
stopped visiting the hemlock grove.
</p><p>In time Solomon Owl grew to look like himself again. And people never
really knew just what had happened to him. But they noticed that he always
hooted angrily whenever anybody mentioned Farmer Green’s name.
