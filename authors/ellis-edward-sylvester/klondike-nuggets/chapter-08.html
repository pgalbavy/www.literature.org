<p>The men wrought steadily in felling trees, and by the close of
the second day had enough timber for their raft. It would have
been much preferable could they have constructed a good, stout
boat; but it was not feasible, though Jeff and Tim would have
built it had they possessed the necessary planking and boards.
They had provided themselves with oakum, pitch, and other material;
but the labor of sawing out the right kind of stuff would have
taken weeks. The Irishman had learned from his late experience;
as a result of which a double-decker, as it may be termed, was
planned. This consisted first of a substantial framework of buoyant
pine logs, securely nailed together, while upon that was reared
another some two feet in height. This upper framework was intended
to bear their outfits, over which were fastened rubber cloths.
The Alaskan lakes are often swept by terrific tempests, the waves
sometimes dashing entirely over the rafts and boats, and wetting
everything that is not well protected. The upper deck serves also
partially to protect the men.</p>

<p>The boys spent a portion of the days in fishing. There was a
notable moderation in the weather, the snow and ice rapidly melting.
Sitting or standing on the bank, they cast out their lines, baited
with bits of meat, and met with pleasing success. Plump, luscious
white-fish, grayling, and lake trout were landed in such numbers
that little or no other solid food was eaten during their halt
at the head of Lake Bennet.</p>

<p>Work was pushed so vigorously that on the third day the goods
were carefully piled on the upper deck, secured in place, and
with their long poles they pushed out from the shore on the voyage
of twenty-eight miles to the foot of the sheet of water. They
were provided with a sturdy mast reared near the middle of the
craft, but they did not erect a sail, for the reason that the
strong wind which was blowing was almost directly from the north,
and would have checked their progress.</p>

<p>The unwieldy structure was pushed along the eastern side, where
the poles were serviceable at all times. Each took his turn at
the work, the boys with the others, and the progress, if slow,
was sure.</p>

<p>The first twelve miles of Lake Bennet are quite shallow, with
a width barely exceeding a half mile. Fifteen miles down occurs
the junction with the southwest arm, and the point had hardly
come into sight when Tim said:</p>

<p>"Now look out for trouble, for here's where we'll catch it sure."</p>

<p>All understood what he meant, for a wind was blowing down the
arm with such fierceness that it looked as if everything would
be swept off the raft. The prospect was so threatening that they
ran inshore while yet at a safe distance, and waited for the gale
to subside.</p>

<p>"Is it likely to last long?" asked Roswell, when they had secured
shelter.</p>

<p>"That depinds how far off the end of the same may be," was the
unsatisfactory reply. "I've knowed men to be held here for days,
but I have hopes that we may get off in the coorse of two or three
weeks."</p>

<p>The boys as well as Jeff could not believe that Tim was in earnest,
for his lightest words were often spoken with the gravest expression
of face; but their former experience taught them to be prepared
for almost any whim in the weather. They recalled those dismal
days and nights earlier on their journey, when they were storm-stayed,
and they were depressed at the thought that something of the nature
might again overtake them. When the boys proposed to put up the
tent, the Irishman said:</p>

<p>"It is early in the day; bide awhile before going to that trouble."</p>

<p>This remark convinced them that he was more hopeful of a release
than would be implied from his words; so they wrapped their heavy
coats closer and hoped for the best. The men lit their pipes,
while the boys huddled close together and had little to say. Unexpectedly
there came such a lull in the gale early in the afternoon that
the voyage, to the delight of all, was resumed.</p>

<p>Ike Hardman was in more genial spirits than at any time since
he joined the company. He showed an eagerness to help, declining
to yield the pole when Jeff offered to relieve him, and ventured
now and then upon some jest with Roswell and Frank. Their distrust,
however, was not lessened, and they were too honest to affect
a liking that it was impossible to feel. They had little to say
to him, and noticing the fact, he finally let them alone. Whatever
misgiving Jeff may have felt was skilfully concealed, and the
fellow could have felt no suspicion that his secret was suspected
by any member of the company.</p>

<p>The wind blew so strongly that there was some misgiving; but
observing that it came from the right quarter, the sail was hoisted,
and as the canvas bellied outward, the raft caught the impulse
and began moving through the water at a rate that sent the ripples
flying over the square ends of the logs at the front. All sat
down on the upper framework, with the exception of Jeff, who stood,
pole in hand, at the bow, ready to guide the structure should
it sheer in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>The conformation of the shore and a slight change of wind carried
the raft farther out on the lake. Observing that it was getting
slightly askew, Jeff pushed the long pole downward until his hand
almost touched the surface of the water. While holding it there
the other end bobbed up, having failed to touch ground.</p>

<p>"No use," he said, facing his friends, who were watching him,
"the bottom may be half a mile below."</p>

<p>"That looks as if we're over our hids," said Tim; "by which token,
if this steamer blows up we've got to swim for our lives, and
I never larned to swim a stroke."</p>

<p>The boys looked at him wonderingly.</p>

<p>"How is it you did not learn?" asked Roswell.</p>

<p>"I've tried hundreds of times. I kept in the water till me toes
begun to have webs between 'em, but at the first stroke me hid
went down and me heels up. I can swim in that style," he added
gravely, "but find the same slightly inconvanient owing to the
necissity of braithing now and thin. I tried fur a long time to
braithe through me toes, but niver made much of a succiss of it."</p>

<p>"And I learned to swim in one day," remarked Frank; "strange
that you should have so much trouble."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly that's because yer hid is so light, while me own
brains weigh me down; it's aisy to understand that."</p>

<p>"If we should have any mishap, Tim," said Frank, "you must remember
to hold fast to a piece of wood to help you float&mdash;a small bit
is enough."</p>

<p>"I have a bitter plan than that."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Niver have anything to do wid the water."</p>

<p>"That would be certain safety if you could carry it out; but
you can't help it all times&mdash;such, for instance, as the present."</p>

<p>"And I'm thinking we shall have plinty of the same before we
raich Dawson."</p>

<p>"After we get to the foot of this lake, what comes next, Tim?"</p>

<p>"Caribou Crossing, which we pass through to Lake Tagish, which
isn't quite as big as is this one. I'm thinking," he added thoughtfully,
watching the rising anger of the waves, "that bime-by, whin we
come near land, we'll be going that fast that we'll skim over
the snow like a sled to the nixt lake."</p>

<p>Roswell pointed to the shore on their right, indicating a stake
which rose upright from the ground and stood close to the water.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That," replied Tim, "marks the grave of some poor chap that
died on his way to the Klondike. Do ye obsarve that cairn of stones
a bit beyont?"</p>

<p>Each saw it.</p>

<p>"That marks anither grave; and ye may call to mind that we obsarved
more of the same along Lake Lindeman."</p>

<p>Such was the fact, though this was the first reference to them.</p>

<p>"And we shall hardly be out of sight of some of the same all
the way to the Klondike; and I'm thinking," was his truthful remark,
"that hundreds more will lay their bones down in these parts and
niver see their loved ones again."</p>

<p>It was a sad thought. In a few years improved routes, railway-tracks,
and houses for food and lodging will rob the Klondike region of
its terrors, but until then death must exact a heavy toll from
the gold-seekers crowding northward, without regard to season
or the simplest laws of prudence.</p>

<p>Roswell was standing on the upper deck, near a corner, when he
exclaimed excitedly:</p>

<p>"Oh, look there! Isn't it dreadful?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "OH, <em>LOOK THERE! ISN'T IT DREADFUL</em>?"]</p>

<p>He was pointing out on the lake, and, following the direction
of his hand, all saw the answer to his question.</p>
