<p>November was well advanced, and the first snow of the season was
falling when Starr Wiley reappeared in New York.  His coming was
unheralded, but Harrington Chase was on hand when the train crawled
into the station at midnight and the two partners repaired to the room
of the returned wanderer, where they held an absorbing conference until
the small hours.
</p><p>Nevertheless, Wiley was stirring bright and early.  He appeared thinner
than a month or two previous, and he was tanned as with much roughing
it on the open trail; his eyes, too, were clear, but there was an odd,
furtive droop to their lids which had not been noticeable before.
</p><p>Abstractedly he drank his coffee, and then, ignoring the tray piled
high with its accumulation of mail which his valet had placed on the
table, he drew his lounging-robe about him and picked up the telephone.
</p><p>When his number was connected a respectful male voice replied to the
summons.
</p><p>"Mr. Halstead.  Mr. Vernon Halstead, please. . . .  Well, wake him,
then. . . .  I can't help that, it's important."
</p><p>There was a full minute's pause and then a querulous, sleepy voice
grumbled over the wire.
</p><p>"That you, Vernie?  This is Starr. . . .  Just last night. . . .  No,
you won't, either, you're not supposed to know I'm in town till someone
else tells you later in the day, do you understand? . . .  The racket
is this: I've got to see you at once, privately.  I'll wait here just
twenty minutes for you. . . .  Yes, you can and you will!  You seem to
forget, my friend, that I hold the whip hand. . . .  No hard feelings,
Vernie, but you know what's in store for you if you don't do what
you're told. . .  That's better!  In twenty minutes?  Right!"
</p><p>Willa, meantime, had plowed her way through the slush in the Park on
her early morning canter, and surrendered herself listlessly to the
hands of her hair-dresser.  A morning musicale, a luncheon, four teas,
a dinner, opera and a dance formed the program of the day before her
and she quailed in spirit.  The novelty of the first few weeks
following her initial dinner party had worn off, and greater ease and
familiarity with the social round brought with it only an added
restlessness and contempt.
</p><p>There had been no clash, of late, between her will and that of the wary
Mrs. Halstead, but the latter watched her every move with argus eyes
and directed each detail of the day so implacably that Willa had
followed the line of least resistance, save in one particular: she
still slipped away at odd moments and left no trail.
</p><p>Mrs. Halstead was therefore suspicious when, after the luncheon, Willa
pleaded a headache, and announced flatly that she would take a siesta
in lieu of attending the receptions.
</p><p>"But, my dear, surely you will make an effort to put in an appearance,
at least at the Allardyce's.  I am particularly anxious that you make
an impression there; they are most exclusive, and if they take you up
your position is assured.  You cannot afford to miss this opportunity."
</p><p>"Oh, yes, I can."  The smooth, dominant voice roused Willa swiftly to
white heat.  "I haven't seen anything about this outfit yet that comes
too high for Grandfather Murdaugh's money."
</p><p>It was the first cynical remark that had ever fallen from the girl's
lips, but she was learning fast, and Mrs. Halstead recognized the storm
signals and withdrew.
</p><p>In the hall, she encountered Willa's maid, a bright-eyed, hard-featured
Frenchwoman.
</p><p>"Liane, if Mademoiselle goes out before I return, you know what to do?"
</p><p>"Bien, Madame, pairfectly."  The woman smiled quietly, and, turning,
reëntered her mistress' room.
</p><p>"Go away, Liane.  I'm going to try to rest.  No, don't pull the
curtains, I want the air.  You may call me at six."
</p><p>Willa waited half an hour, then, dressing quickly in plain, dark
clothing, she slipped from the house.
</p><p>A taxi' stand was two blocks away on the Avenue, and as Willa stepped
into the first cab, a taller, portlier figure entered the second, and
followed slowly but persistently through the maze of traffic.  The girl
glanced from the window at the back to make sure of her espionage, then
took up the speaking-tube.
</p><p>"Never mind that address I gave you.  Drive into the Park, to where you
can find a sharp turn in the road; get around it as fast as the law
will let you and then stop, but keep your engine going.  There's a good
tip in it for you if you obey instructions."
</p><p>"Right, Miss."
</p><p>The car swerved into the Park entrance, and Willa sat back with a
peculiar light in her eyes.  When it stopped abruptly she sprang out,
and, walking rapidly back to the turn in the driveway, waited beside a
screening clump of shrubbery.
</p><p>In a moment the second taxi' hummed about the corner.  The girl stepped
forward with her arm thrown up and the chauffeur, bewildered, brought
his car to a stop with a grinding jar of the brakes.  In a moment Willa
had the door open.
</p><p>"Get out, Liane," she commanded briefly, and with one look at her
blazing eyes the woman meekly obeyed.  Willa turned to the chauffeur.
"How much does your meter register?  Take it out of this, keep the rest
for yourself and go.  Your fare will not need you any longer."
</p><p>The man hesitated, but his late passenger made no move, and the
proffered banknote was a tempting one.  He took it and went.
</p><p>When the humming of his engine had died away Willa addressed herself to
the cowering maid.
</p><p>"You can walk back now, and tell your employer that you have failed.
Tell her, too, that your services are no longer required, and mind you
stay only long enough to pack your things, for if I find you there on
my return, I'll show you what we do to spies where I come from!"
</p><p>"But, Mademoiselle, I was obeying my instructions!"  The maid
gesticulated vehemently.  "Madame commanded that I follow and observe
who is at the rendez-vous.  If Mademoiselle will be calm and tranquil
we may come to an understanding, is it not so?  I would prefer to be
wholly in the service of Mademoiselle, and we might together arrange a
little story for Madame----"
</p><p>"Sell her out, would you, you treacherous Jane!"  The old vernacular
returned unbidden to Willa's lips.  "You'd play both ways from the ace
and take in the look-out?  If I had you down in Mexico I'd shoot you
full of holes!  You heard me!  If I find you at the house when I get
back, look out for your wretched skin!"
</p><p>She sprang into her own taxi with a swift word to the chauffeur and
bowled away, leaving her erstwhile guard wringing her hands in the road.
</p><p>At the gate of the neat little frame house far up on the Parkway, her
driver hesitated.
</p><p>"Excuse me, Miss, but it's only fair to tell you this car can be traced
here from the stand.  I wouldn't double-cross you, but if the police
get after me I'll have to come through."
</p><p>Willa smiled and then her face grew thoughtful.
</p><p>"This isn't a matter for the police.  You look like a white man.
What's your job worth to you a week?"
</p><p>"Anywhere from fifty to seventy-five; depends on the fares I get," the
chauffeur returned promptly.
</p><p>"I think I can use you.  What is your name?"
</p><p>"Daniel Morrissey, Miss."
</p><p>"I'm Willa Murdaugh."  She gave no heed to the man's respectful stare.
"I'll give you a hundred a week flat.  You throw up your job, meet me
to-morrow at the Circle at ten in the morning and we'll go and buy a
good car, light and strong and fast.  Can you drive a racer?"
</p><p>"Anything on wheels but a locomotive!"
</p><p>"All right.  I'll pay you for six months, whether I use you that long
or not, and make you a present of the car when I'm through with you.
Is it a go, Dan?"
</p><p>Then ensued the spectacle of Miss Willa Murdaugh, most important
débutante of the season, and Daniel Morrissey, chauffeur, binding the
bargain with a solemn handshake.
</p><p>While her new ally waited, she mounted the steps of the porch and rang
the bell.  Hurried footsteps thumped along the hall within, and a
weazened, hunch backed lad smiled eagerly in the doorway.
</p><p>"Greeting to thee, José."  Willa spoke in soft, liquid Spanish.  "I
have come to tell thee that we are safe here no longer.  We must seek
another casa this very day."
</p><p>Dinner-time came and passed, and the Halstead family sat in strained
silence, their engagements forgotten in the new anxiety which
enshrouded them.  Mason North, hastily summoned to the conference,
paced the floor restlessly.
</p><p>"It was a mistake, Irene!" he said at last.  "If you had told me I
would never have sanctioned it.  You can't treat a girl of Willa's type
that way."
</p><p>"But something had to be done!" Mrs. Halstead cried.  "You and Ripley
were both powerless to combat her, and we must know what scandal these
mysterious errands of hers are likely to portend.  This is what comes
of putting a beggar on horseback!"
</p><p>"And there is nothing to prevent her riding straight back to Mexico,
renouncing the inheritance and daring us to go after her!" the lawyer
retorted.  "Where would your share of your uncle's estate go then, my
dear Irene?  The girl's never been too keen on this proposition,
anyhow, as I've tried to make you realize; drive her too hard, and
she'll throw the whole thing to the four winds."
</p><p>"I'll master her yet."  Mrs. Halstead spoke through set teeth.  "No
insolent chit of a girl can defy me!  The conditions of the will give
me a certain amount of authority and I shall exercise it to the limit.
Willa must be controlled."
</p><p>"Then play fair!"  A voice sounded from the doorway, and Willa herself
looked in on them.  "Don't set your servants to spy on me and try to
interfere with affairs which are my concern alone."
</p><p>"My dear child!  What a frightful hour you have given us!"  Mason North
wrung her hand in hearty relief.  "Come in and sit down, and we will
talk it all over.  We are willing to admit that an injustice has been
done you, but we must clear the air once and for all."
</p><p>Willa complied.
</p><p>"I think it is about time for an understanding," she said.  "I don't
want any admissions or recriminations, and I don't intend to submit to
a lot of questions.  Let's get right down to business.  Do you want to
start?"
</p><p>The lawyer hesitated, taken aback by her cool, matter-of-fact manner.
It bore no trace of insolence, yet conveyed a serene poise and grasp of
the situation which was disconcerting.
</p><p>"No, Willa."  It was Ripley Halstead who replied mildly.  The two
younger Halsteads merely stared.  "Tell us just what is on your mind.
I want you to be happy here; that is the first consideration."
</p><p>"I'm not thinking about that just now."  Willa's calm, direct gaze
moved from one to the other of them.  "I'm going to speak plainly; it's
the best thing for all of us.  This thing is a business proposition,
pure and simple.  If it were not for the terms of Grandfather
Murdaugh's will no one would ever have tried to find me; no one made
the least attempt to help my father and mother, on even see that they
were given a fair chance to help themselves.  I'm not unmindful of the
kindness you've all shown me here, however.  Cousin Irene has been very
conscientious in trying to make a lady of me, but that was a part of
her bargain, wasn't it?"
</p><p>Mrs. Halstead glared, but made no comment, and after a moment the girl
went on wistfully:
</p><p>"Of course, if we could have grown fond of each other it would have
made things easier, but I'm so different from you-all that I guess you
couldn't really like me.  It looks to me as if we were all sort of in
partnership to carry out the terms of Grandfather's will, and whether
we like each other or not we've got to stick or get out of the game.
Whether we're civil to each other or not, too, depends on our own
decency, I expect, but we've got to play square."
</p><p>She paused, and the lawyer remarked:
</p><p>"We are all ready to, my dear Willa.  We are only trying to safeguard
your interests, and yourself.  You are very young and unsophisticated
and you know nothing of the city.  We feel that you should be frank
with us and tell us where it is that you go by yourself and what errand
takes you.  What are we to think if you do not explain?"
</p><p>"I don't know," Willa replied simply.  "Partners trust each other,
don't they?"
</p><p>Ripley Halstead smiled.
</p><p>"Not always, Willa.  But in this case we do not distrust your good
intent, only your impulsiveness and inexperience.  We really need not
have made a family matter of this; do you wish to speak to your Cousin
Irene alone, or to Mr. North and me?"
</p><p>Willa opened wide eyes.
</p><p>"Why should I?  I have nothing to tell anyone.  I suppose I seem
awfully young and foolish to you, but I'm not afraid New York has much
danger for me; I've taken care of myself in all sorts of situations,
among the roughest hombres that ever crossed the border.  You must
trust me now.  I am not doing anything wrong, I give you my word;
anything that would create scandal in the way Cousin Irene fears.  It's
just an affair of my own, that started before I ever knew I was Willa
Murdaugh; it's a kind of a trust laid on me, and I must fulfill it
alone."
</p><p>There was a ring in her tones that was almost solemn, and as the lawyer
looked into her clear, young face his former vague hypothesis that his
ward was being blackmailed faded forever from his mind.  Whatever the
situation confronting her might be, she was the prime mover and the
initiative was hers.  What strange motive could lurk behind her calm
surety and singleness of purpose?
</p><p>"I can tell you where she goes, if you want to know!"
</p><p>Angie said suddenly and turned with a mendacious inspiration on her
brother.  "So could Vernie.  He saw her!  It's to a little frame
cottage away up on the Parkway."
</p><p>"_I_ saw her!" ejaculated Vernon, glowering at her.  "I like that!  I
never said anything of the kind, and it isn't true, anyway!"
</p><p>"What does it matter?" Willa asked wearily.  "I will not be shamed by
being spied upon by servants.  Am I to be trusted on my word of honor
that I am doing nothing wrong, or shall I go away?"
</p><p>"Certainly not, my dear girl."  Ripley Halstead rose and held out his
hand.  "I'll apologize, if my wife does not, for the trick that was
attempted to-day.  We will trust you absolutely, but I should like to
have your assurance that if you find yourself in any difficulty you
will come to either Mr. North or me."
</p><p>"I'll gladly promise that."  Willa turned hesitatingly toward Mrs.
Halstead.  "I am really very sorry if I have been insolent, but Liane's
behavior this afternoon aroused all my fighting blood."
</p><p>Mrs. Halstead kissed her coldly.
</p><p>"I hope you realize that I thought I was doing only my duty.  There is
one question I must ask you, though, and since you refuse to discuss
this with me privately you must take the consequences.  In justice to
yourself I will say that I do not believe you capable of carrying on a
vulgar flirtation or intrigue, but remember we knew practically nothing
of you when we took you into our home.  If you are interested in
anyone, if you are secretly engaged, you should tell us and your fiancé
must present himself here.  Willa, is there a man in the case?"
</p><p>The girl smiled slowly and gazed off into space.  Watching her, Mason
North drew a deep breath, for into her changing expression there came a
look of implacable, passionless vengeance which made her for the moment
the personification of Fate.
</p><p>"Yes," she said at last.  "There is a man in the case, Cousin Irene,
but not as you imagine.  I have not seen him since I left Mexico and
personally he is nothing to me; in fact, I scarcely know him, as you
count knowing a person.  I have a little matter of business to settle
with him, that is all."
</p><p>Mrs. Halstead sighed and turned to the door as the butler appeared.
</p><p>"What is it, Welsh?"
</p><p>"A gentleman, Madam."  He extended the salver.
</p><p>Mrs. Halstead glanced at the card and then quickly toward her daughter,
and her face broke into an exultant smile.
</p><p>"Of course, we are at home!"  Then, as Welsh withdrew.  "Fancy, we did
not even know he had returned!  It's Starr Wiley!"
