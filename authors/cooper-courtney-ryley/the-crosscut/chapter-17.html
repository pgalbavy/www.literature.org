<p>Had it been any one else, Fairchild would have shouted for happiness
and joined the parade.  As it was, he stood far at one side, a silent,
grim figure, watching the miners and townspeople passing before him,
leaping about in their happiness, calling to him the news that he did
not want to hear:
</p>
<p>The Silver Queen had "hit."  The faith of Squint Rodaine, maintained
through the years, had shown his perspicacity.  It was there; he always
had said it was there, and now the strike had been made at last,
lead-silver ore, running as high as two hundred dollars a ton.  And
just like Squint--so some one informed Fairchild--he had kept it a
secret until the assays all had been made and the first shipments
started to Denver.  It meant everything for Ohadi; it meant that mining
would boom now, that soon the hills would be clustered with
prospectors, and that the little town would blossom as a result of
possessing one of the rich silver mines of the State.  Some one tossed
to Fairchild a small piece of ore which had been taken from a car at
the mouth of the mine; and even to his uninitiated eyes it was
apparent,--the heavy lead, bearing in spots the thin filagree of white
metal--and silver ore must be more than rich to make a showing in any
kind of sample.
</p><p>He felt cheap.  He felt defeated.  He felt small and mean not to be
able to join the celebration.  Squint and Maurice Rodaine possessed the
Silver Queen; that they, of all persons, should be the fortunate ones
was bitter and hard to accept.  Why should they, of every one in Ohadi,
be the lucky men to find a silver bonanza, that they might flaunt it
before him, that they might increase their standing in the community,
that they might raise themselves to a pedestal in the eyes of every one
and thereby rally about them the whole town in any difficulty which
might arise in the future?  It hurt Fairchild, it sickened him.  He saw
now that his enemies were more powerful than ever.  And for a moment he
almost wished that he had yielded down there in Denver, that he had not
given the ultimatum to the greasy Barnham, that he had accepted the
offer made him,--and gone on, out of the fight forever.
</p><p>Anita!  What would it mean to her?  Already engaged, already having
given her answer to Maurice Rodaine, this now would be an added
incentive for her to follow her promise.  It would mean a possibility
of further argument with her father, already too weak from illness to
find the means of evading the insidious pleas of the two men who had
taken his money and made him virtually their slave.  Could they not
demonstrate to him now that they always had worked for his best
interests?  And could not that plea go even farther--to Anita
herself--to persuade her that they were always laboring for her, that
they had striven for this thing that it might mean happiness for her
and for her father?  And then, could they not content themselves with
promises, holding before her a rainbow of the far-away, to lead her
into their power, just as they had led the stricken, bedridden man she
called "father"?  The future looked black for Robert Fairchild.  Slowly
he walked past the happy, shouting crowd and turned up Kentucky Gulch
toward the ill-fated Blue Poppy.
</p><p>The tunnel opening looked more forlorn than ever when he sighted it, a
bleak, staring, single eye which seemed to brood over its own
misfortunes, a dead, hopeless thing which never had brought anything
but disappointment.  A choking came into Fairchild's throat.  He
entered the tunnel slowly, ploddingly; with lagging muscles he hauled
up the bucket which told of Harry's presence below, then slowly lowered
himself into the recesses of the shaft and to the drift leading to the
stope, where only a few days before they had found that gaunt,
whitened, haunting thing which had brought with it a new misfortune.
</p><p>A light gleamed ahead, and the sound of a single jack hammering on the
end of a drill could be heard.  Fairchild called and went forward, to
find Harry, grimy and sweating, pounding away at a narrow streak of
black formation which centered in the top of the stope.
</p><p>"It's the vein," he announced, after he had greeted Fairchild, "and it
don't look like it's going to amount to much!"
</p><p>"No?"
</p><p>Harry withdrew the drill from the hole he was making and mopped his
forehead.
</p><p>"It ain't a world-beater," came disconsolately.  "I doubt whether it
'll run more 'n twenty dollars to the ton, the wye smelting prices 'ave
gone up!  And there ain't much money in that.  What 'appened in Denver?"
</p><p>"Another frame-up by the Rodaines to get the mine away from us.  It was
a lawyer.  He stalled that the offer had been made to us by Miss
Richmond."
</p><p>"How much?"
</p><p>"Two hundred thousand dollars and us to get out of all the troubles we
are in."
</p><p>"And you took it, of course?"
</p><p>"I did not!"
</p><p>"No?"  Harry mopped his forehead again.  "Well, maybe you 're right.
Maybe you 're wrong.  But whatever you did--well, that's just the thing
I would 'ave done."
</p><p>"Thanks, Harry."
</p><p>"Only--" and Harry was staring lugubriously at the vein above him,
"it's going to take us a long time to get two hundred thousand dollars
out of things the wye they stand now."
</p><p>"But--"
</p><p>"I know what you're thinking--that there's silver 'ere and that we 're
going to find it.  Maybe so.  I know your father wrote some pretty
glowing accounts back to Beamish in St. Louis.  It looked awful good
then.  Then it started to pinch out, and now--well, it don't look so
good."
</p><p>"But this is the same vein, is n't it?"
</p><p>"I don't know.  I guess it is.  But it's pinching fast.  It was about
this wye when we first started on it.  It was n't worth much and it was
n't very wide.  Then, all of a sudden, it broadened out, and there was
a lot more silver in it.  We thought we 'd found a bonanza.  But it
narrowed down again, and the old standard came back.  I don't know what
it's going to do now--it may quit altogether."
</p><p>"But we 're going to keep at it, Harry, sink or swim."
</p><p>"You know it!"
</p><p>"The Rodaines have hit--maybe we can have some good luck too."
</p><p>"The  Rodaines?"  Harry stared.  "'It what?"
</p><p>"Two hundred dollar a ton ore!"
</p><p>A long whistle.  Then Harry, who had been balancing a single jack,
preparatory to going back to his work, threw it aside and began to roll
down his sleeves.
</p><p>"We 're going to 'ave a look at it."
</p><p>"A look?  What good would it--?"
</p><p>"A cat can look at a king," said Harry.  "They can't arrest us for
going up there like everybody else."
</p><p>"But to go there and ask them to look at their riches--"
</p><p>"There ain't no law against it!"
</p><p>He reached for his carbide lamp, hooked to a small chink of the hanging
wall, and then pulled his hat over his bulging forehead.  Carefully he
attempted to smooth his straying mustache, and failing, as always, gave
up the job.
</p><p>"I 'd be 'appy, just to look at it," he announced.  "Come on.  Let's
forget 'oo they are and just be lookers-on."
</p><p>Fairchild agreed against his will.  Out of the shaft they went and on
up the hill to where the townspeople again were gathering about the
opening of the Silver Queen.  A few were going in.  Fairchild and 'Arry
joined them.
</p><p>A long walk, stooping most of the way, as the progress was made through
the narrow, low-roofed tunnel; then a slight raise which traveled for a
fair distance at an easy grade--at last to stop; and there before them,
jammed between the rock, was the strike, a great, heavy streaking vein,
nearly six feet wide, in which the ore stuck forth in tremendous
chunks, embedded in a black background.  Harry eyed it studiously.
</p><p>"You can see the silver sticking out!" he announced at last.  "It's
wonderful--even if the Rodaines did do it."
</p><p>A form brushed past them, Blindeye Bozeman, returning from the
celebration.  Picking up a drill, he studied it with care, finally to
lay it aside and reach for a gad, a sort of sharp, pointed prod, with
which to tear away the loose matter that he might prepare the way for
the biting drive of the drill beneath the five-pound hammer, or single
jack.  His weak, watery eyes centered on Harry, and he grinned.
</p><p>"Didn't believe it, huh?" came his query.
</p><p>Harry pawed his mustache.
</p><p>"I believed it, all right, but anybody likes to look at the United
States Mint!"
</p><p>"You 've said it.  She 's going to be more than that when we get a few
portable air compressors in here and start at this thing in earnest
with pneumatic drills.  What's more, the old man has declared Taylor
Bill and me in on it--for a ten per cent. bonus.  How's that sound to
you?"
</p><p>"Like 'eaven," answered Harry truthfully.  "Come on, Boy, let's us get
out of 'ere.  I 'll be getting the blind staggers if I stay much
longer."
</p><p>Fairchild accompanied him wordlessly.  It was as though Fate had played
a deliberate trick, that it might laugh at him.  And as he walked
along, he wondered more than ever about the mysterious telegram and the
mysterious conversation of the greasy Barnham in Denver.  That--as he
saw it now--had been only an attempt at another trick.  Suppose that he
had accepted; suppose that he had signified his willingness to sell his
mine and accept the good offices of the "secret friend" to end his
difficulties.  What would have been the result?
</p><p>For once a ray of cheer came to him.  The Rodaines had known of this
strike long before he ever went to that office in Denver.  They had
waited long enough to have their assays made and had completed their
first shipment to the smelter.  There was no necessity that they buy
the Blue Poppy mine.  Therefore, was it simply another trick to break
him, to lead him up to a point of high expectations, then, with a laugh
at his disappointment, throw him down again?  His shoulders
straightened as they reached the outside air, and he moved close to
Harry as he told him his conjectures.  The Cornishman bobbed his head.
</p><p>"I never thought of it that way!" he agreed.  "But it could explain a
lot of things.  They 're working on our--what-you-call-it?"
</p><p>"Psychological resistance."
</p><p>"That's it.  Psych--that's it.  They want to beat us and they don't
care 'ow.  It 'urts a person to be disappointed.  That's it.  I alwyes
said you 'ad a good 'ead on you!  That's it.  Let's go back to the Blue
Poppy."
</p><p>Back they went, once more to descend the shaft, once more to follow the
trail along the drift toward the opening of the stope.  And there,
where loose earth covered the place where a skeleton once had rested,
Fairchild took off his coat and rolled up his sleeves.
</p><p>"Harry," he said, with a new determination, "this vein does n't look
like much, and the mine looks worse.  From the viewpoint we 've got now
of the Rodaine plans, there may not be a cent in it.  But if you're
game, I'm game, and we'll work the thing until it breaks us."
</p><p>"You 've said it.  If we 'it anything, fine and well--if we can turn
out five thousand dollars' worth of stuff before the trial comes up,
then we can sell hit under the direction of the court, turn over that
money for a cash bond, and get the deeds back.  If we can't, and if the
mine peters out, then we ain't lost anything but a lot of 'opes and
time.  But 'ere goes.  We 'll double-jack.  I 've got a big 'ammer
'ere.  You 'old the drill for awhile and turn it, while I sling th'
sledge.  Then you take th' 'ammer and Lor' 'ave mercy on my 'ands if
you miss."
</p><p>Fairchild obeyed.  They began the drilling of the first indentation
into the six-inch vein which lay before them.  Hour after hour they
worked, changing positions, sending hole after hole into the narrow
discoloration which showed their only prospect of returns for the
investments which they had put into the mine.  Then, as the afternoon
grew late, Harry disappeared far down the drift to return with a
handful of greasy, candle-like things, wrapped in waxed paper.
</p><p>"I knew that dynamite of yours could n't be shipped in time, so I
bought a little up 'ere," he explained, as he cut one of the sticks in
two with a pocketknife and laid the pieces to one side.  Then out came
a coil of fuse, to be cut to its regular lengths and inserted in the
copper-covered caps of fulminate of mercury, Harry showing his contempt
for the dangerous things by crimping them about the fuse with his
teeth, while Fairchild, sitting on a small pile of muck near by, begged
for caution.  But Harry only grinned behind his big mustache and went
on.
</p><p>Out came his pocketknife again as he slit the waxed paper of the
gelatinous sticks, then inserted the cap in the dynamite.  One after
another the charges were shoved into the holes, Harry tamping them into
place with a steel rod, instead of with the usual wooden affair, his
mustache brushing his shoulder as he turned to explain the virtues of
dynamite when handled by an expert.
</p><p>"It's all in the wye you do it," he announced.  "If you don't strike
fire with a steel rod, it's fine."
</p><p>"But if you do?"
</p><p>"Oh, then!" Harry laughed.  "Then it's flowers and a funeral--after
they 've finished picking you up."
</p><p>One after another he pressed the dynamite charges tight into the drill
holes and tamped them with muck wrapped in a newspaper that he dragged
from his hip pocket.  Then he lit the fuses from his lamp and stood a
second in assurance that they all were spluttering.
</p><p>"Now we run!" he announced, and they hurried, side by side, down the
drift tunnel until they reached the shaft.  "Far enough," said Harry.
</p><p>A long moment of waiting.  Then the earth quivered and a muffled,
booming roar came from the distance.  Harry stared at his carbide lamp.
</p><p>"One," he announced.  Then, "Two."
</p><p>Three, four and five followed, all counted seriously, carefully by
Harry.  Finally they turned back along the drift toward the stope, the
acrid odor of dynamite smoke-cutting at their nostrils as they
approached the spot where the explosions had occurred.  There Harry
stood in silent contemplation for a long time, holding his carbide over
the pile of ore that had been torn from the vein above.
</p><p>"It ain't much," came at last.  "Not more 'n 'arf a ton.  We won't get
rich at that rate.  And besides--" he looked upward--"we ain't even
going to be getting that pretty soon.  It's pinching out."
</p><p>Fairchild followed his gaze, to see in the torn rock above him only a
narrow streak now, fully an inch and a half narrower than the vein had
been before the powder holes had been drilled.  It could mean only one
thing: that the bet had been played and lost, that the vein had been
one of those freak affairs that start out with much promise, seem to
give hope of eternal riches, and then gradually dwindle to nothing.
Harry shook his head.
</p><p>"It won't last."
</p><p>"Not more than two or three more shots," Fairchild agreed.
</p><p>"You can't tell about that.  It may run that way all through the
mountain--but what's a four-inch vein?  You can go up 'ere in the
Argonaut tunnel and find 'arf a dozen of them things that they don't
even take the trouble to mine.  That is, unless they run 'igh in
silver--" he picked up a chunk of the ore from the muck pile where it
had been deposited and studied it intently--"but I don't see any pure
silver sticking out in this stuff."
</p><p>"But it must be here somewhere.  I don't know anything about
mining--but don't veins sometimes pinch off and then show up later on?"
</p><p>"Sure they do--sometimes.  But it's a gamble."
</p><p>"That's all we 've had from the beginning, Harry."
</p><p>"And it's about all we 're going to 'ave any time unless something bobs
up sudden like."
</p><p>Then, by common consent, they laid away their working clothes and left
the mine, to wander dejectedly down the gulch and to the boarding
house.  After dinner they chatted a moment with Mother Howard,
neglecting to tell her, however, of the downfall of their hopes, then
went upstairs, each to his room.  An hour later Harry knocked at
Fairchild's door, and entered, the evening paper in his hand.
</p><p>"'Ere 's something more that's nice," he announced, pointing to an item
on the front page.  It was the announcement that a general grand jury
was to be convened late in the summer and that one of its tasks
probably would be to seek to unravel the mystery of the murder of
Sissie Larsen!
</p><p>Fairchild read it with morbidity.  Trouble seemed to have become more
than occasional, and further than that, it appeared to descend upon him
at just the times when he could least resist it.  He made no comment;
there was little that he could say.  Again he read the item and again,
finally to turn the page and breathe sharply.  Before him was a
six-column advertisement, announcing the strike in the Silver Queen
mine and also spreading the word that a two-million-dollar company
would be formed, one million in stock to represent the mine itself, the
other to be subscribed to exploit this new find as it should be
exploited.  Glowing words told of the possibilities of the Silver
Queen, the assayer's report was reproduced on a special cut which
evidently had been made in Denver and sent to Ohadi by rush delivery.
Offices had been opened; everything had been planned in advance and the
advertisement written before the town was aware of the big discovery up
Kentucky Gulch.  All of it Fairchild read with a feeling he could not
down,--a feeling that Fate, somehow, was dealing the cards from the
bottom, and that trickery and treachery and a venomous nature were the
necessary ingredients, after all, to success.  The advertisement seemed
to sneer at him, to jibe at him, calling as it did for every upstanding
citizen of Ohadi to join in on the stock-buying bonanza that would make
the Silver Queen one of the biggest mines in the district and Ohadi the
big silver center of Colorado.  The words appeared to be just so many
daggers thrust into his very vitals.  But Fairchild read them all, in
spite of the pain they caused.  He finished the last line, looked at
the list of officers, and gasped.
</p><p>For there, following one another, were three names, two of which
Fairchild had expected.  But the other--
</p><p>They were, president and general manager, R. B. (Squint) Rodaine;
secretary-treasurer, Maurice Rodaine; and first vice-president--Miss
Anita Natalie Richmond!
