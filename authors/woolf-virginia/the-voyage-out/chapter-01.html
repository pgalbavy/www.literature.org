<p>As the streets that lead from the Strand to the Embankment are
very narrow, it is better not to walk down them arm-in-arm. If
you persist, lawyers' clerks will have to make flying leaps into
the mud; young lady typists will have to fidget behind you. In
the streets of London where beauty goes unregarded, eccentricity
must pay the penalty, and it is better not to be very tall, to
wear a long blue cloak, or to beat the air with your left hand.</p>

<p>One afternoon in the beginning of October when the traffic was
becoming brisk a tall man strode along the edge of the pavement
with a lady on his arm. Angry glances struck upon their backs.
The small, agitated figures&mdash;for in comparison with this couple
most people looked small&mdash;decorated with fountain pens, and burdened
with despatch-boxes, had appointments to keep, and drew a weekly
salary, so that there was some reason for the unfriendly stare
which was bestowed upon Mr. Ambrose's height and upon Mrs. Ambrose's
cloak. But some enchantment had put both man and woman beyond
the reach of malice and unpopularity. In his case one might guess
from the moving lips that it was thought; and in hers from the
eyes fixed stonily straight in front of her at a level above the
eyes of most that it was sorrow. It was only by scorning all she
met that she kept herself from tears, and the friction of people
brushing past her was evidently painful. After watching the traffic
on the Embankment for a minute or two with a stoical gaze she
twitched her husband's sleeve, and they crossed between the swift
discharge of motor cars. When they were safe on the further side,
she gently withdrew her arm from his, allowing her mouth at the
same time to relax, to tremble; then tears rolled down, and leaning
her elbows on the balustrade, she shielded her face from the curious.
Mr. Ambrose attempted consolation; he patted her shoulder; but
she showed no signs of admitting him, and feeling it awkward to
stand beside a grief that was greater than his, he crossed his
arms behind him, and took a turn along the pavement.</p>

<p>The embankment juts out in angles here and there, like pulpits;
instead of preachers, however, small boys occupy them, dangling
string, dropping pebbles, or launching wads of paper for a cruise.
With their sharp eye for eccentricity, they were inclined to think
Mr. Ambrose awful; but the quickest witted cried "Bluebeard!"
as he passed. In case they should proceed to tease his wife, Mr.
Ambrose flourished his stick at them, upon which they decided
that he was grotesque merely, and four instead of one cried "Bluebeard!"
in chorus.</p>

<p>Although Mrs. Ambrose stood quite still, much longer than is
natural, the little boys let her be. Some one is always looking
into the river near Waterloo Bridge; a couple will stand there
talking for half an hour on a fine afternoon; most people, walking
for pleasure, contemplate for three minutes; when, having compared
the occasion with other occasions, or made some sentence, they
pass on. Sometimes the flats and churches and hotels of Westminster
are like the outlines of Constantinople in a mist; sometimes the
river is an opulent purple, sometimes mud-coloured, sometimes
sparkling blue like the sea. It is always worth while to look
down and see what is happening. But this lady looked neither up
nor down; the only thing she had seen, since she stood there,
was a circular iridescent patch slowly floating past with a straw
in the middle of it. The straw and the patch swam again and again
behind the tremulous medium of a great welling tear, and the tear
rose and fell and dropped into the river. Then there struck close
upon her ears&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>Yes, she knew she must go back to all that, but at present she
must weep. Screening her face she sobbed more steadily than she
had yet done, her shoulders rising and falling with great regularity.
It was this figure that her husband saw when, having reached the
polished Sphinx, having entangled himself with a man selling picture
postcards, he turned; the stanza instantly stopped. He came up
to her, laid his hand on her shoulder, and said, "Dearest." His
voice was supplicating. But she shut her face away from him, as
much as to say, "You can't possibly understand."</p>

<p>As he did not leave her, however, she had to wipe her eyes, and
to raise them to the level of the factory chimneys on the other
bank. She saw also the arches of Waterloo Bridge and the carts
moving across them, like the line of animals in a shooting gallery.
They were seen blankly, but to see anything was of course to end
her weeping and begin to walk.</p>

<p>"I would rather walk," she said, her husband having hailed a
cab already occupied by two city men.</p>

<p>The fixity of her mood was broken by the action of walking. The
shooting motor cars, more like spiders in the moon than terrestrial
objects, the thundering drays, the jingling hansoms, and little
black broughams, made her think of the world she lived in. Somewhere
up there above the pinnacles where the smoke rose in a pointed
hill, her children were now asking for her, and getting a soothing
reply. As for the mass of streets, squares, and public buildings
which parted them, she only felt at this moment how little London
had done to make her love it, although thirty of her forty years
had been spent in a street. She knew how to read the people who
were passing her; there were the rich who were running to and
from each others' houses at this hour; there were the bigoted
workers driving in a straight line to their offices; there were
the poor who were unhappy and rightly malignant. Already, though
there was sunlight in the haze, tattered old men and women were
nodding off to sleep upon the seats. When one gave up seeing the
beauty that clothed things, this was the skeleton beneath.</p>

<p>A fine rain now made her still more dismal; vans with the odd
names of those engaged in odd industries &mdash;Sprules, Manufacturer
of Saw-dust; Grabb, to whom no piece of waste paper comes amiss&mdash;fell
flat as a bad joke; bold lovers, sheltered behind one cloak, seemed
to her sordid, past their passion; the flower women, a contented
company, whose talk is always worth hearing, were sodden hags;
the red, yellow, and blue flowers, whose heads were pressed together,
would not blaze. Moreover, her husband walking with a quick rhythmic
stride, jerking his free hand occasionally, was either a Viking
or a stricken Nelson; the sea-gulls had changed his note.</p>

<p>"Ridley, shall we drive? Shall we drive, Ridley?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ambrose had to speak sharply; by this time he was far away.</p>

<p>The cab, by trotting steadily along the same road, soon withdrew
them from the West End, and plunged them into London. It appeared
that this was a great manufacturing place, where the people were
engaged in making things, as though the West End, with its electric
lamps, its vast plate-glass windows all shining yellow, its carefully-finished
houses, and tiny live figures trotting on the pavement, or bowled
along on wheels in the road, was the finished work. It appeared
to her a very small bit of work for such an enormous factory to
have made. For some reason it appeared to her as a small golden
tassel on the edge of a vast black cloak.</p>

<p>Observing that they passed no other hansom cab, but only vans
and waggons, and that not one of the thousand men and women she
saw was either a gentleman or a lady, Mrs. Ambrose understood
that after all it is the ordinary thing to be poor, and that London
is the city of innumerable poor people. Startled by this discovery
and seeing herself pacing a circle all the days of her life round
Picadilly Circus she was greatly relieved to pass a building put
up by the London County Council for Night Schools.</p>

<p>"Lord, how gloomy it is!" her husband groaned. "Poor creatures!"</p>

<p>What with the misery for her children, the poor, and the rain,
her mind was like a wound exposed to dry in the air.</p>

<p>At this point the cab stopped, for it was in danger of being
crushed like an egg-shell. The wide Embankment which had had room
for cannonballs and squadrons, had now shrunk to a cobbled lane
steaming with smells of malt and oil and blocked by waggons. While
her husband read the placards pasted on the brick announcing the
hours at which certain ships would sail for Scotland, Mrs. Ambrose
did her best to find information. From a world exclusively occupied
in feeding waggons with sacks, half obliterated too in a fine
yellow fog, they got neither help nor attention. It seemed a miracle
when an old man approached, guessed their condition, and proposed
to row them out to their ship in the little boat which he kept
moored at the bottom of a flight of steps. With some hesitation
they trusted themselves to him, took their places, and were soon
waving up and down upon the water, London having shrunk to two
lines of buildings on either side of them, square buildings and
oblong buildings placed in rows like a child's avenue of bricks.</p>

<p>The river, which had a certain amount of troubled yellow light
in it, ran with great force; bulky barges floated down swiftly
escorted by tugs; police boats shot past everything; the wind
went with the current. The open rowing-boat in which they sat
bobbed and curtseyed across the line of traffic. In mid-stream
the old man stayed his hands upon the oars, and as the water rushed
past them, remarked that once he had taken many passengers across,
where now he took scarcely any. He seemed to recall an age when
his boat, moored among rushes, carried delicate feet across to
lawns at Rotherhithe.</p>

<p>"They want bridges now," he said, indicating the monstrous outline
of the Tower Bridge. Mournfully Helen regarded him, who was putting
water between her and her children. Mournfully she gazed at the
ship they were approaching; anchored in the middle of the stream
they could dimly read her name&mdash;<em>Euphrosyne</em>.</p>

<p>Very dimly in the falling dusk they could see the lines of the
rigging, the masts and the dark flag which the breeze blew out
squarely behind.</p>

<p>As the little boat sidled up to the steamer, and the old man
shipped his oars, he remarked once more pointing above, that ships
all the world over flew that flag the day they sailed. In the
minds of both the passengers the blue flag appeared a sinister
token, and this the moment for presentiments, but nevertheless
they rose, gathered their things together, and climbed on deck.</p>

<p>Down in the saloon of her father's ship, Miss Rachel Vinrace,
aged twenty-four, stood waiting her uncle and aunt nervously.
To begin with, though nearly related, she scarcely remembered
them; to go on with, they were elderly people, and finally, as
her father's daughter she must be in some sort prepared to entertain
them. She looked forward to seeing them as civilised people generally
look forward to the first sight of civilised people, as though
they were of the nature of an approaching physical discomfort&mdash;a
tight shoe or a draughty window. She was already unnaturally braced
to receive them. As she occupied herself in laying forks severely
straight by the side of knives, she heard a man's voice saying
gloomily:</p>

<p>"On a dark night one would fall down these stairs head foremost,"
to which a woman's voice added, "And be killed."</p>

<p>As she spoke the last words the woman stood in the doorway. Tall,
large-eyed, draped in purple shawls, Mrs. Ambrose was romantic
and beautiful; not perhaps sympathetic, for her eyes looked straight
and considered what they saw. Her face was much warmer than a
Greek face; on the other hand it was much bolder than the face
of the usual pretty Englishwoman.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rachel, how d'you do," she said, shaking hands.</p>

<p>"How are you, dear," said Mr. Ambrose, inclining his forehead
to be kissed. His niece instinctively liked his thin angular body,
and the big head with its sweeping features, and the acute, innocent
eyes.</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Pepper," Rachel bade the servant. Husband and wife
then sat down on one side of the table, with their niece opposite
to them.</p>

<p>"My father told me to begin," she explained. "He is very busy
with the men. . . . You know Mr. Pepper?"</p>

<p>A little man who was bent as some trees are by a gale on one
side of them had slipped in. Nodding to Mr. Ambrose, he shook
hands with Helen.</p>

<p>"Draughts," he said, erecting the collar of his coat.</p>

<p>"You are still rheumatic?" asked Helen. Her voice was low and
seductive, though she spoke absently enough, the sight of town
and river being still present to her mind.</p>

<p>"Once rheumatic, always rheumatic, I fear," he replied. "To some
extent it depends on the weather, though not so much as people
are apt to think."</p>

<p>"One does not die of it, at any rate," said Helen.</p>

<p>"As a general rule&mdash;no," said Mr. Pepper.</p>

<p>"Soup, Uncle Ridley?" asked Rachel.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear," he said, and, as he held his plate out, sighed
audibly, "Ah! she's not like her mother." Helen was just too late
in thumping her tumbler on the table to prevent Rachel from hearing,
and from blushing scarlet with embarrassment.</p>

<p>"The way servants treat flowers!" she said hastily. She drew
a green vase with a crinkled lip towards her, and began pulling
out the tight little chrysanthemums, which she laid on the table-cloth,
arranging them fastidiously side by side.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"You knew Jenkinson, didn't you, Ambrose?" asked Mr. Pepper across
the table.</p>

<p>"Jenkinson of Peterhouse?"</p>

<p>"He's dead," said Mr. Pepper.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear! &mdash;I knew him&mdash;ages ago," said Ridley. "He was
the hero of the punt accident, you remember? A queer card. Married
a young woman out of a tobacconist's, and lived in the Fens&mdash;never
heard what became of him."</p>

<p>"Drink&mdash;drugs," said Mr. Pepper with sinister conciseness. "He
left a commentary. Hopeless muddle, I'm told."</p>

<p>"The man had really great abilities," said Ridley.</p>

<p>"His introduction to Jellaby holds its own still," went on Mr.
Pepper, "which is surprising, seeing how text-books change."</p>

<p>"There was a theory about the planets, wasn't there?" asked Ridley.</p>

<p>"A screw loose somewhere, no doubt of it," said Mr. Pepper, shaking
his head.</p>

<p>Now a tremor ran through the table, and a light outside swerved.
At the same time an electric bell rang sharply again and again.</p>

<p>"We're off," said Ridley.</p>

<p>A slight but perceptible wave seemed to roll beneath the floor;
then it sank; then another came, more perceptible. Lights slid
right across the uncurtained window. The ship gave a loud melancholy
moan.</p>

<p>"We're off!" said Mr. Pepper. Other ships, as sad as she, answered
her outside on the river. The chuckling and hissing of water could
be plainly heard, and the ship heaved so that the steward bringing
plates had to balance himself as he drew the curtain. There was
a pause.</p>

<p>"Jenkinson of Cats&mdash;d'you still keep up with him?" asked Ambrose.</p>

<p>"As much as one ever does," said Mr. Pepper. "We meet annually.
This year he has had the misfortune to lose his wife, which made
it painful, of course."</p>

<p>"Very painful," Ridley agreed.</p>

<p>"There's an unmarried daughter who keeps house for him, I believe,
but it's never the same, not at his age."</p>

<p>Both gentlemen nodded sagely as they carved their apples.</p>

<p>"There was a book, wasn't there?" Ridley enquired.</p>

<p>"There <em>was</em> a book, but there never <em>will</em> be
a book," said Mr. Pepper with such fierceness that both ladies
looked up at him.</p>

<p>"There never will be a book, because some one else has written
it for him," said Mr. Pepper with considerable acidity. "That's
what comes of putting things off, and collecting fossils, and
sticking Norman arches on one's pigsties."</p>

<p>"I confess I sympathise," said Ridley with a melancholy sigh.
"I have a weakness for people who can't begin."</p>

<p>". . . The accumulations of a lifetime wasted," continued Mr.
pepper. "He had accumulations enough to fill a barn."</p>

<p>"It's a vice that some of us escape," said Ridley. "Our friend
Miles has another work out to-day."</p>

<p>Mr. Pepper gave an acid little laugh. "According to my calculations,"
he said, "he has produced two volumes and a half annually, which,
allowing for time spent in the cradle and so forth, shows a commendable
industry."</p>

<p>"Yes, the old Master's saying of him has been pretty well realised,"
said Ridley.</p>

<p>"A way they had," said Mr. Pepper. "You know the Bruce collection?&mdash;not
for publication, of course."</p>

<p>"I should suppose not," said Ridley significantly. "For a Divine
he was&mdash;remarkably free."</p>

<p>"The Pump in Neville's Row, for example?" enquired Mr. Pepper.</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Ambrose.</p>

<p>Each of the ladies, being after the fashion of their sex, highly
trained in promoting men's talk without listening to it, could
think&mdash;about the education of children, about the use of fog sirens
in an opera&mdash;without betraying herself. Only it struck Helen that
Rachel was perhaps too still for a hostess, and that she might
have done something with her hands.</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;?" she said at length, upon which they rose and left,
vaguely to the surprise of the gentlemen, who had either thought
them attentive or had forgotten their presence.</p>

<p>"Ah, one could tell strange stories of the old days," they heard
Ridley say, as he sank into his chair again. Glancing back, at
the doorway, they saw Mr. Pepper as though he had suddenly loosened
his clothes, and had become a vivacious and malicious old ape.</p>

<p>Winding veils round their heads, the women walked on deck. They
were now moving steadily down the river, passing the dark shapes
of ships at anchor, and London was a swarm of lights with a pale
yellow canopy drooping above it. There were the lights of the
great theatres, the lights of the long streets, lights that indicated
huge squares of domestic comfort, lights that hung high in air.
No darkness would ever settle upon those lamps, as no darkness
had settled upon them for hundreds of years. It seemed dreadful
that the town should blaze for ever in the same spot; dreadful
at least to people going away to adventure upon the sea, and beholding
it as a circumscribed mound, eternally burnt, eternally scarred.
From the deck of the ship the great city appeared a crouched and
cowardly figure, a sedentary miser.</p>

<p>Leaning over the rail, side by side, Helen said, "Won't you be
cold?" Rachel replied, "No. . . . How beautiful!" she added a
moment later. Very little was visible&mdash;a few masts, a shadow of
land here, a line of brilliant windows there. They tried to make
head against the wind.</p>

<p>"It blows&mdash;it blows!" gasped Rachel, the words rammed down her
throat. Struggling by her side, Helen was suddenly overcome by
the spirit of movement, and pushed along with her skirts wrapping
themselves round her knees, and both arms to her hair. But slowly
the intoxication of movement died down, and the wind became rough
and chilly. They looked through a chink in the blind and saw that
long cigars were being smoked in the dining-room; they saw Mr.
Ambrose throw himself violently against the back of his chair,
while Mr. Pepper crinkled his cheeks as though they had been cut
in wood. The ghost of a roar of laughter came out to them, and
was drowned at once in the wind. In the dry yellow-lighted room
Mr. Pepper and Mr. Ambrose were oblivious of all tumult; they
were in Cambridge, and it was probably about the year 1875.</p>

<p>"They're old friends," said Helen, smiling at the sight. "Now,
is there a room for us to sit in?"</p>

<p>Rachel opened a door.</p>

<p>"It's more like a landing than a room," she said. Indeed it had
nothing of the shut stationary character of a room on shore. A
table was rooted in the middle, and seats were stuck to the sides.
Happily the tropical suns had bleached the tapestries to a faded
blue-green colour, and the mirror with its frame of shells, the
work of the steward's love, when the time hung heavy in the southern
seas, was quaint rather than ugly. Twisted shells with red lips
like unicorn's horns ornamented the mantelpiece, which was draped
by a pall of purple plush from which depended a certain number
of balls. Two windows opened on to the deck, and the light beating
through them when the ship was roasted on the Amazons had turned
the prints on the opposite wall to a faint yellow colour, so that
"The Coliseum" was scarcely to be distinguished from Queen Alexandra
playing with her Spaniels. A pair of wicker arm-chairs by the
fireside invited one to warm one's hands at a grate full of gilt
shavings; a great lamp swung above the table&mdash;the kind of lamp
which makes the light of civilisation across dark fields to one
walking in the country.</p>

<p>"It's odd that every one should be an old friend of Mr. Pepper's,"
Rachel started nervously, for the situation was difficult, the
room cold, and Helen curiously silent.</p>

<p>"I suppose you take him for granted?" said her aunt.</p>

<p>"He's like this," said Rachel, lighting on a fossilised fish
in a basin, and displaying it.</p>

<p>"I expect you're too severe," Helen remarked.</p>

<p>Rachel immediately tried to qualify what she had said against
her belief.</p>

<p>"I don't really know him," she said, and took refuge in facts,
believing that elderly people really like them better than feelings.
She produced what she knew of William Pepper. She told Helen that
he always called on Sundays when they were at home; he knew about
a great many things&mdash;about mathematics, history, Greek, zoology,
economics, and the Icelandic Sagas. He had turned Persian poetry
into English prose, and English prose into Greek iambics; he was
an authority upon coins; and&mdash;one other thing&mdash;oh yes, she thought
it was vehicular traffic.</p>

<p>He was here either to get things out of the sea, or to write
upon the probable course of Odysseus, for Greek after all was
his hobby.</p>

<p>"I've got all his pamphlets," she said. "Little pamphlets. Little
yellow books." It did not appear that she had read them.</p>

<p>"Has he ever been in love?" asked Helen, who had chosen a seat.</p>

<p>This was unexpectedly to the point.</p>

<p>"His heart's a piece of old shoe leather," Rachel declared, dropping
the fish. But when questioned she had to own that she had never
asked him.</p>

<p>"I shall ask him," said Helen.</p>

<p>"The last time I saw you, you were buying a piano," she continued.
"Do you remember&mdash;the piano, the room in the attic, and the great
plants with the prickles?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and my aunts said the piano would come through the floor,
but at their age one wouldn't mind being killed in the night?"
she enquired.</p>

<p>"I heard from Aunt Bessie not long ago," Helen stated. "She is
afraid that you will spoil your arms if you insist upon so much
practising."</p>

<p>"The muscles of the forearm&mdash;and then one won't marry?"</p>

<p>"She didn't put it quite like that," replied Mrs. Ambrose.</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;of course she wouldn't," said Rachel with a sigh.</p>

<p>Helen looked at her. Her face was weak rather than decided, saved
from insipidity by the large enquiring eyes; denied beauty, now
that she was sheltered indoors, by the lack of colour and definite
outline. Moreover, a hesitation in speaking, or rather a tendency
to use the wrong words, made her seem more than normally incompetent
for her years. Mrs. Ambrose, who had been speaking much at random,
now reflected that she certainly did not look forward to the intimacy
of three or four weeks on board ship which was threatened. Women
of her own age usually boring her, she supposed that girls would
be worse. She glanced at Rachel again. Yes! how clear it was that
she would be vacillating, emotional, and when you said something
to her it would make no more lasting impression than the stroke
of a stick upon water. There was nothing to take hold of in girls&mdash;nothing
hard, permanent, satisfactory. Did Willoughby say three weeks,
or did he say four? She tried to remember.</p>

<p>At this point, however, the door opened and a tall burly man
entered the room, came forward and shook Helen's hand with an
emotional kind of heartiness, Willoughby himself, Rachel's father,
Helen's brother-in-law. As a great deal of flesh would have been
needed to make a fat man of him, his frame being so large, he
was not fat; his face was a large framework too, looking, by the
smallness of the features and the glow in the hollow of the cheek,
more fitted to withstand assaults of the weather than to express
sentiments and emotions, or to respond to them in others.</p>

<p>"It is a great pleasure that you have come," he said, "for both
of us."</p>

<p>Rachel murmured in obedience to her father's glance.</p>

<p>"We'll do our best to make you comfortable. And Ridley. We think
it an honour to have charge of him. Pepper'll have some one to
contradict him&mdash;which I daren't do. You find this child grown,
don't you? A young woman, eh?"</p>

<p>Still holding Helen's hand he drew his arm round Rachel's shoulder,
thus making them come uncomfortably close, but Helen forbore to
look.</p>

<p>"You think she does us credit?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Helen.</p>

<p>"Because we expect great things of her," he continued, squeezing
his daughter's arm and releasing her. "But about you now." They
sat down side by side on the little sofa. "Did you leave the children
well? They'll be ready for school, I suppose. Do they take after
you or Ambrose? They've got good heads on their shoulders, I'll
be bound?"</p>

<p>At this Helen immediately brightened more than she had yet done,
and explained that her son was six and her daughter ten. Everybody
said that her boy was like her and her girl like Ridley. As for
brains, they were quick brats, she thought, and modestly she ventured
on a little story about her son,&mdash;how left alone for a minute
he had taken the pat of butter in his fingers, run across the
room with it, and put it on the fire&mdash;merely for the fun of the
thing, a feeling which she could understand.</p>

<p>"And you had to show the young rascal that these tricks wouldn't
do, eh?"</p>

<p>"A child of six? I don't think they matter."</p>

<p>"I'm an old-fashioned father."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Willoughby; Rachel knows better."</p>

<p>Much as Willoughby would doubtless have liked his daughter to
praise him she did not; her eyes were unreflecting as water, her
fingers still toying with the fossilised fish, her mind absent.
The elder people went on to speak of arrangements that could be
made for Ridley's comfort&mdash;a table placed where he couldn't help
looking at the sea, far from boilers, at the same time sheltered
from the view of people passing. Unless he made this a holiday,
when his books were all packed, he would have no holiday whatever;
for out at Santa Marina Helen knew, by experience, that he would
work all day; his boxes, she said, were packed with books.</p>

<p>"Leave it to me&mdash;leave it to me!" said Willoughby, obviously
intending to do much more than she asked of him. But Ridley and
Mr. Pepper were heard fumbling at the door.</p>

<p>"How are you, Vinrace?" said Ridley, extending a limp hand as
he came in, as though the meeting were melancholy to both, but
on the whole more so to him.</p>

<p>Willoughby preserved his heartiness, tempered by respect. For
the moment nothing was said.</p>

<p>"We looked in and saw you laughing," Helen remarked. "Mr. Pepper
had just told a very good story."</p>

<p>"Pish. None of the stories were good," said her husband peevishly.</p>

<p>"Still a severe judge, Ridley?" enquired Mr. Vinrace.</p>

<p>"We bored you so that you left," said Ridley, speaking directly
to his wife.</p>

<p>As this was quite true Helen did not attempt to deny it, and
her next remark, "But didn't they improve after we'd gone?" was
unfortunate, for her husband answered with a droop of his shoulders,
"If possible they got worse."</p>

<p>The situation was now one of considerable discomfort for every
one concerned, as was proved by a long interval of constraint
and silence. Mr. Pepper, indeed, created a diversion of a kind
by leaping on to his seat, both feet tucked under him, with the
action of a spinster who detects a mouse, as the draught struck
at his ankles. Drawn up there, sucking at his cigar, with his
arms encircling his knees, he looked like the image of Buddha,
and from this elevation began a discourse, addressed to nobody,
for nobody had called for it, upon the unplumbed depths of ocean.
He professed himself surprised to learn that although Mr. Vinrace
possessed ten ships, regularly plying between London and Buenos
Aires, not one of them was bidden to investigate the great white
monsters of the lower waters.</p>

<p>"No, no," laughed Willoughby, "the monsters of the earth are
too many for me!"</p>

<p>Rachel was heard to sigh, "Poor little goats!"</p>

<p>"If it weren't for the goats there'd be no music, my dear; music
depends upon goats," said her father rather sharply, and Mr. Pepper
went on to describe the white, hairless, blind monsters lying
curled on the ridges of sand at the bottom of the sea, which would
explode if you brought them to the surface, their sides bursting
asunder and scattering entrails to the winds when released from
pressure, with considerable detail and with such show of knowledge,
that Ridley was disgusted, and begged him to stop.</p>

<p>From all this Helen drew her own conclusions, which were gloomy
enough. Pepper was a bore; Rachel was an unlicked girl, no doubt
prolific of confidences, the very first of which would be: "You
see, I don't get on with my father." Willoughby, as usual, loved
his business and built his Empire, and between them all she would
be considerably bored. Being a woman of action, however, she rose,
and said that for her part she was going to bed. At the door she
glanced back instinctively at Rachel, expecting that as two of
the same sex they would leave the room together. Rachel rose,
looked vaguely into Helen's face, and remarked with her slight
stammer, "I'm going out to t-t-triumph in the wind."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ambrose's worst suspicions were confirmed; she went down
the passage lurching from side to side, and fending off the wall
now with her right arm, now with her left; at each lurch she exclaimed
emphatically, "Damn!"</p>
