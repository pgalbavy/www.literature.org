<p>It has been said that Agnes Altman, seated behind the boulder
on the edge of the rude fortification near the river, was among
the most alert of the pioneers that had taken refuge there until
Simon Kenton could open the way for their escape across the Ohio.</p>

<p>To this fact may be ascribed the startling discovery she made
that an Indian warrior was crouching on the other side of the
boulder, no more than three feet from where she was listening
with intensest attention, and in this discovery she preceded all
other members of the company.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe, indeed, was so close that it may be said the slight
noise he made shut out the rustling of the wind and the rippling
of the current against the bank, the overhanging branches and
around the twisted roots along shore.</p>

<p>She heard his body move along the surface of the rock, and, pressing
her ear against it, caught the slight disturbance more distinctly.
A solid substance, as every one knows, is a better conductor of
sound than air, and the medium was of more help to her than she
dreamed it could be.</p>

<p>What particular thing her mortal enemy was doing she could not
surmise, nor did it specially concern her to know at that moment;
there could be no doubt that he was in a state of pernicious activity.</p>

<p>The question which the maiden asked herself was, whether she
should not acquaint George Ashbridge with what she had learned.
He was almost at her elbow, as has been explained, and, brief
as was the time, several whispered conferences had taken place.</p>

<p>But, if she should speak or move, the Indian on the other side
of the boulder would take the alarm and make off. This, it would
seem, was the very thing which a young woman in her situation
ought to desire above all others, but Agnes thought the miscreant
should not be allowed to escape in that manner, at least not before
he and his people had been taught a well-needed lesson.</p>

<p>She concluded to remain quiescent and await developments.</p>

<p>The next thing decided upon may have been characteristic of her
age and sex, but, all the same, it was a piece of recklessness
almost the equal of the weakness shown when she placed the knife
in the hand of The Panther. She decided to peep over the top of
the rock and learn what the Shawanoe was doing.</p>

<p>Sufficient moonlight found its way among the branches to permit
one to see indistinctly for a few feet. She was confident that
she could give their enemy one quick glance and then drop back
before he could do her harm.</p>

<p>Her heart beat a little faster than it was wont when, with the
silence of a phantom, she began slowly raising her head, with
her eyes fixed on the top of the rock, which she touched with
her hands. Before she reached the elevation in mind, she discovered
the Indian was doing the same thing, and, fortunately for her,
was two or three seconds advanced with the action.</p>

<p>The crown of the warrior, with the projecting eagle feathers,
were as if they were a part of the darkness itself, so vaguely
were they outlined in the gloom, though their identity was as
clear to the girl as if the noon-day sun was shining upon the
painted features.</p>

<p>The head rose just high enough for the glittering eyes to peer
over the horizon of the rock in the endeavor to learn something
of the situation within the interior of the "fort."</p>

<p>Agnes was transfixed for a moment. She feared that if she sank
lower, or changed her position, the Indian would detect it and
use his knife or tomahawk, and the same unspeakable dread prevented
her crying out to warn George Ashbridge or any of the others of
their peril.</p>

<p>She had no weapon of her own at command, and very probably it
would have made no difference if she had, for she was but an infant
before this terrible embodiment of strength, treachery and hate.
But she felt she must do something to teach the miscreant the
risk he ran by his daring act.</p>

<p>Groping silently with her right hand among and under the leaves,
she managed to clutch some gravel and dirt, which, with a quick
flirt, she intended to fling in the face of the Indian. It would
probably cause him some inconvenience and considerable surprise,
though the weapon was too insignificant for him to make any use
of it.</p>

<p>The result of the novel demonstration can only be guessed, since
the opportunity to try it passed at the moment Agnes was ready
to make the test. When in the act of drawing back her hand, the
head of the Shawanoe vanished as noiselessly as it had obtruded
on the scene.</p>

<p>It seems incredible that the savage could have gained any knowledge
of the interior of the fortification or of the location of the
defenders. The gloom was too deep to permit the use of any vision
except that of the owl or cat. He had probably withdrawn to repeat
his attempt at some other point.</p>

<p>Again, the marvelous delicacy of hearing told the girl that her
enemy was in motion, not directly in front of the boulder, but
on the left, in the direction of George Ashbridge. She peered
intently at that point, wondering how much longer she ought to
remain motionless and mute, and on the point of calling, in a
suppressed voice, to her lover, when something whisked by her
elbow, too quickly or too dimly seen for her to comprehend at
once what it meant.</p>

<p>Then it flashed upon her.</p>

<p>"George!" she called, in an undertone, so full of dread and terror
that he was at her side in an instant.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? What has happened?"</p>

<p>"There's an Indian within the inclosure!"</p>

<p>"Impossible! You are mistaken!"</p>

<p>"I saw him this minute."</p>

<p>"Where? Tell me how it was!" he whispered, seizing her hand,
and quick to catch her excitement.</p>

<p>"I saw the top of his head peeping over this very rock in front
of me. I was about to call to you, when he dropped down again.
The next moment he passed over the spot where you are. He did
it so quickly and silently that I heard nothing, and caught only
the most shadowy glimpses of him."</p>

<p>"Can it be possible? I cannot dispute you, and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>A tall figure, walking erect, assumed form in the gloom, and
was upon the startled lovers before they were aware of it.</p>

<p>Young Ashbridge was in the act of bringing his rifle to a level,
when Weber Hastings spoke.</p>

<p>"Not too fast, younkers. I'm afeared I didn't do the best thing
in the world, when I placed you two so near each other."</p>

<p>"No matter where you placed her," replied the youth, "you did
a good thing for the rest. She has sharper eyes than any of us,
for she has seen what nobody else saw."</p>

<p>"What's that? What's that?"</p>

<p>"Within the last three minutes," said Agnes, "one of the Shawanoes
passed by this boulder behind which I have been sitting, and is
now somewhere within the inclosure. Oh, I wonder if he means any
harm to your folks, George, or mine!"</p>

<p>And spurred by her new terror she hurried across the brief intervening
space to where her mother and Miss Altman were sitting trembling,
and occasionally whispering in the darkness.</p>

<p>Thank heaven! no harm had befallen them, and since there was
no call for her to return to George Ashbridge and Weber Hastings,
she remained with those that were so near and dear to her.</p>

<p>"Them varmints are gettin' pow'rful sassy," was the comment of
Hastings, who, now that the truth was known, seemed to lose all
the excitement he had first shown. "You don't think the gal was
mistook?"</p>

<p>"I am sure she was not."</p>

<p>"So am I; stay right here where you be, while I look around for
that varmint; keep a lookout yourself, for he may try to sneak
out this way."</p>

<p>"All I want is a chance at him."</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;helloa!"</p>

<p>It so happened that Jim Deane, fully recovered from the effects
of the rattlesnake antidote he had taken earlier in the evening,
was on guard at a point almost opposite where Agnes Altman had
made her alarming discovery. Instead of being sheltered by boulders
and rocks, he had lain down behind some branches and logs, which
he himself had helped place in position weeks before, when he
and his companions were caught in their desperate straits.</p>

<p>Stretched at full length upon his face, with one hand grasping
the barrel of his rifle in front and hearing nothing, he felt
something softly touch his foot. The ranger did not speak or move
a limb, but with rare cleverness, suspected the astonishing truth;
one of the Shawanoe had entered the fort and was making a tour
of inspection. The miscreant would offer harm to no one until
he had gathered the knowledge he sought. Then he doubtless meant
to deal some swift, terrible blows with his knife, and make off
before anything could be done in the way of punishment.</p>

<p>The ranger turned his head and peered over his shoulder behind
him. Lying flat on the ground, while the one that had touched
him was on his feet, the advantage was with the white man. The
almost impalpable outlines of a crouching figure that had paused
upon touching his foot was revealed, and all doubt vanished from
the mind of Deane.</p>

<p>His posture, as will be perceived, was an awkward one compared
with that of the Shawanoe. It was necessary for the white man
to change it before he could assume the offensive, and during
the making of that change was the time for the hostile to get
in his effective work.</p>

<p>The possibility of his doing so caused no hesitation on the part
of Jim Deane. He flirted himself upon his back, snapped his feet
beneath his body, and came to a standing position in a twinkling.
In the act of doing so, he cocked his rifle.</p>

<p>The click of the hammer warned the intruder of his danger. His
situation was not one in which to make a fight, and he turned
to flee. The white man heard him, and dashed through the gloom
to gain sufficient sight to warrant a shot. The fugitive must
have been as familiar with the ground as was his pursuer, for
he showed no hesitation as to his course, nor did he give any
evidence of blundering.</p>

<p>He was so near the side of the inclosure that he had to run but
a few steps when he made a leap which lifted him several feet
above the obstruction, and it was this temporary elevation which
gave the ranger the chance he was seeking. At the moment the figure
was at the highest point of the arch, with his feet gathered beneath
him, the ranger brought his gun to his shoulder and let fly.</p>

<p>A flash, a resounding report, a rasping shriek that resounded
through the woods, and the Shawanoe sprawled forward on his face,
with his hands clutching the leaves and dirt, and then all was
still.</p>

<p>"That 'ere varmint ought to have knowed that 'cause a man happens
to git bit by a rattler and takes an over-dose of antidote, it
ain't no reason for stubbin' your toe agin him, and thinkin' he's
forgot how to shoot off a gun."</p>

<p>"You managed that purty well, Jim," quietly remarked Weber Hastings,
appearing that moment at his elbow. "Glad to see you don't forget
to reload as quick as you kin."</p>

<p>"I larned that long ago; wonder if there are any more of the
varmints 'bout."</p>

<p>"If there is, they'll be a little more keerful, but there's no
saying what'll be the next thing&mdash;sh!"</p>

<p>Through the arches of the forest stole the soft, tremulous notes
of a night bird&mdash;so faintly heard that even the trained ears of
the ranger could do no more than guess the distance.</p>

<p>"That's Kenton," he remarked, in a guarded voice; "I'm powerful
glad of it, for now something will be done."</p>
