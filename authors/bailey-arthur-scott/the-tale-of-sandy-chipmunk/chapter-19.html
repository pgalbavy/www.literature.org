<p>When Sandy Chipmunk reached Farmer Green's barn he crept inside and
looked all around. He had expected to find the barn crowded with saucers
full of milk. But not a single saucer did he see. There were two long
rows of cows stabled in the barn. And Sandy noticed Farmer Green and his
boy and his hired man, each sitting on a low stool beside a cow. They
were milking the cows. But Sandy did not know it.
</p>
<p>He began to think that Henry Skunk had played a trick on him. And he was
about to leave the barn when he turned to look at several bright tin
pails standing on the floor.
</p><p>Sandy crept up to one of them and sniffed at it. He was glad that he had
done that, for he smelled <u>milk</u>. There was no mistake about it.
</p><p>Sandy Chipmunk couldn't crawl up the side of the pail, it was so smooth
and slippery. So he jumped right up and stood on its edge. And looking
inside, he saw that the pail was almost full of milk. He knew then that
Henry Skunk had told the truth.
</p><p>By bending down Sandy was just able to reach the milk. And he began
drinking it as fast as he could. It was so delicious that he forgot all
about Johnnie Green and his father and the hired man.
</p><p>With his head inside the pail, of course Sandy couldn't see what happened
in the barn. The more he drank, the further down he had to stretch his
neck. And when at last he heard a shout, and a milking-stool came sailing
through the air not far above the pail, Sandy was so startled that he
lost his balance and went <u>plump</u>! into the milk.
</p><p>Luckily, Sandy Chipmunk knew how to swim. So he managed to keep his nose
in the air or he would certainly have drowned.
</p><p>"Where on earth did that chipmunk go?" he heard Johnnie Green say as he
picked up his stool. You see, Johnnie never once thought of looking
inside the pail.
</p><p>Still, Sandy Chipmunk was in a fix. For the inside of the pail was as
smooth and slippery as the outside. And of course he couldn't <u>jump</u> out,
for there was nothing from which he could spring.
</p><p>Now it happened that the pail of milk stood not far behind the surly old
cow that had told Sandy not to be silly, when he asked her for some milk
to drink, in the pasture that day. Johnnie Green's shouting and the stool
hurtling through the air displeased her. And since she was not the sort
to hide her ill nature, she promptly kicked the milkpail over.
</p><p>For a moment Sandy Chipmunk thought that this time the end of the world
had certainly come. The old cow's foot crashed against the pail and sent
it flying against the stone wall on which the barn was built. And Sandy
tumbled out upon the floor in a sea of milk.
</p><p>He didn't wait to learn exactly what had happened. For as soon as he
could scramble to his feet he dashed out of the barn and tore across the
fields towards the pasture.
</p><p>Later, when he reached his house and sat down to rest, he soon forgot
his fright. For he had a very pleasant time licking himself clean. That
was the way Sandy Chipmunk always made himself spick and span. And though
there may be some people who would not consider such an act to be in the
best of taste, Sandy Chipmunk thought what was left of the milk <u>tasted
very good</u>. And since his mother did not object to what he was doing,
perhaps no one else ought to.
