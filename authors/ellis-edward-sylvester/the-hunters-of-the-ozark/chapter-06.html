<p>As soon as Fred Linden discovered the deception respecting the
cow-bell, he made all haste toward the point whence came the sound,
in the hope of warning Terry in time to save him from treachery.
You will understand how quickly events passed when told that,
although he came almost directly to the spot, he did not reach
it until Deerfoot the Shawanoe asked for him. This wonderful Indian,
of whom I shall have considerably more to tell, heard the coming
of the lad whom he had never seen, before either the eye or ear
of Terry Clark could detect his approach.</p>

<p>As may well be supposed, Fred Linden was amazed at what met his
eyes. The sight of Terry in friendly converse with a strange Indian
was the opposite of what he expected to see. He slackened his
hurried walk and looked inquiringly at Terry. The latter could
talk fast when he chose, and the few sentences he rattled off
as his companion came up made the matter tolerably clear.</p>

<p>While the questioning and talk were going on, Deerfoot stood
leaning on his long gun and gazing with a certain natural dignity
at the two friends. He said nothing nor did he appear to show
any special curiosity, though had any one studied his countenance,
he would have seen that he was watching Fred Linden. He had said
that he carried a message to him, and it was no more than natural
that he should wish to know something about him.</p>

<p>As for Fred himself he did not try to hide his profound interest
in the remarkable warrior who had appeared at such an opportune
time, but of whom he had never before heard a word. He knew that
the settlers along the frontier often found valuable allies in
the friendly Indians, and he concluded that this red man was one
of those who, having been maltreated by his own people or kindly
used by the whites, had given his loyalty to the latter; for in
the brief narrative of Terry Clark, he had time only to tell the
leading facts about the rescue of himself. Just then, therefore,
the Irish lad knew more about Deerfoot than did the American.</p>

<p>But it takes only a little time for such a group to become acquainted
with each other. A general handshaking followed, and it happened
more than once that all three were talking at the same moment.
Had any one been able to translate the expression of Deerfoot's
countenance, he would have seen that he was pleased with both
the lads whom he now met for the first time. There was a rollicking
good nature, a cheery courage and ever bubbling hopefulness about
Terry that were contagious, and like so much sunshine that went
with him wherever he went.</p>

<p>Fred Linden was of that manly mold and rugged appearance that
he would have drawn favorable attention wherever he might be.</p>

<p>Such a lad in these days would have been picked out as a born
athlete, one who was capable, with proper training, to become
a first-class ball player, oarsman or boxer. He was a swift runner,
a strong leaper, an expert rifle shot, and his rugged frame and
rough, outdoor life gave him an endurance that few men could surpass.
He was as tall as Deerfoot, with broad shoulders, muscular arms
and legs, clear, keen eyes, a fine chest and a symmetrical frame.</p>

<p>The clothes of the two boys, it is hardly necessary to say, were
of homespun, for a hundred years ago it would have been hard for
them to procure any other kind of goods. The short coat was somewhat
like those used to-day by bicyclists, reaching only a short distance
below the waist, where the girdle was fastened in front. The trowsers,
of the same material, reached to the knees, below which were the
hunting leggins, common along the border. Then came the warm,
woolen stockings and thick, heavy shoes, while the head was surmounted
by a woolen cap, made by the deft fingers at home, and without
any pattern. It was soft, and having no forepiece, sat on the
head in whichever position it happened to be first placed. In
this respect it resembled the valuable sealskins of the present
day. The coats of the lads were open in front, and within were
the pockets, which they used as required, the trowsers also being
provided with a couple of these prime necessities.</p>

<p>When the rattling conversation had gone on for several minutes,
Terry ran a few steps and picked up the bell that the Indian had
placed on the ground. The string which had held it about the neck
of the animal was missing, having probably been cut by the knife
of the impatient Wolf.</p>

<p>"I'll take the same back home wid me and put it on Brindle if
I iver maat her; I shouldn't be so 'stonished that I couldn't
spake if I should find that the spalpeen had killed her."</p>

<p>"No," said Fred, "she isn't harmed; I found her off yonder, cropping
the buds and leaves, as innocently as though she hadn't done any
thing wrong in leading us on this long chase. I started her toward
home, and if she keeps up the gait she must be pretty near there
by this time."</p>

<p>This was good news to Terry, for the loss of the animal would
have been serious to the family of Mr. MacClaskey, her owner.
The Irish lad had hardly picked up the bell when Deerfoot pointed
to the gun lying on the ground, where it had been left by the
Wolf.</p>

<p>"That belongs to my brother."</p>

<p>The delighted Terry could hardly believe what was told him, and
he stood looking doubtfully at Deerfoot, as if suspecting he had
heard him amiss.</p>

<p>"It was you who captured the gun, Deerfoot, and so, if it belongs
to any one, ye are the spalpeen."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe looked down at his own handsome weapon and shook
his head. He had no need of any other weapon. Besides, this singular
youth could not have conscientiously taken it. He did not feel
justified in keeping it for his own use, no matter if in sore
need of such a weapon; but, since the Winnebago had made his demonstration
against Terry Clark, and was compelled to leave the gun behind,
when he was permitted to go, it seemed proper that the prize should
fall into the hands of the Irish lad.</p>

<p>What gave special propriety to the act was the fact that, although
Fred Linden was the owner of a fine gun, Terry had none. When
his father lost his life, his rifle was never recovered, and though
there was one in the family of MacClaskey, the youth had no claim
upon it. He longed for such a weapon, with a longing that it would
be hard to understand. The prize, therefore, was appreciated to
its full value. He picked it up with an embarrassed grin, which
quickly became natural when he turned it over in his hands and
saw what an excellent piece it was.</p>

<p>"More than likely it belonged to a white man in the first place,"
said Fred; "so it is right enough that it should come back to
one of his own race."</p>

<p>"It's loaded," said Terry, slightly raising the hammer and noticing
the powder in the pan. Then he brought the gun to his shoulder
and pointing it at the white trunk of the beech, which partly
showed through the intervening branches and undergrowth, he said:</p>

<p>"If the spalpeen should peep out from behind that tree, I'm thinkin'
I could hit him a harder blow than when I landed me two fists
on his mug."</p>

<p>"The Winnebago is a long ways off," said Deerfoot, with a shake
of his head; "he may meet my brother some day, but it will not
be in this place."</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe having learned all that was to be learned
about his young friends, now reached his hand in the breast of
his hunting shirt and drew out a small, closely-printed Bible,
from between the leaves of which he took a piece of paper that
had been folded several times. He glanced at the superscription,
as if to make sure it was right, and then handed it to Fred, who,
as may be supposed, took it with astonishment. He recognized the
penciled writing as that of his father.</p>

<p>Parting the folds, he read the following:</p>

<p>
MY <em>DEAR FRED</em>:

</p>
<p>
You know that when we left home there were three of us, Hardin,<br/>
Bowlby and myself. There are three of us still, but Bowlby<br/>
considers himself of no account for some weeks to come, because of<br/>
a hurt to his foot which will prevent his getting around for a long<br/>
time. Such being the case, I have concluded, now that I have the<br/>
chance, to send for you to join us. You are old enough and strong<br/>
enough to make a full hand, and you can give us good help. Since we<br/>
have all the animals, you will come afoot, but you will find no<br/>
trouble in keeping to the trail, which has been traveled often<br/>
enough to make it plain. It is no more than a hundred miles from<br/>
Greville to our camp at the foot of the Ozark Mountains, so you<br/>
ought to have no difficulty in reaching here in the course of three<br/>
or four days. Love to your mother and Edith.

</p>
<p>
I send this by a young Shawanoe warrior, called Deerfoot. He is the<br/>
most remarkable Indian I ever knew. I shall have a good deal to<br/>
tell you about him when you reach here.

</p>
<p>
<em>YOUR FATHER</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>"Deerfoot bids his brothers good-by," said the young Indian,
offering his hand, when he saw Fred had finished reading his letter;
"he hopes that he shall see them again."</p>

<p>"It won't be our fault if he doesn't," was the cordial response
of Fred Linden, in which Terry heartily joined him. After a few
more pleasant words they parted, Deerfoot following in the footsteps
of the fleeing Winnebago, while the others moved to the northward
in the direction of the creek. They turned aside a little from
the direct course so as to hunt for Brindle, that Fred had seen,
but she was not found. To their delight, however, they saw her
footprints on the edge of the creek, proving that she had gone
home with the directness of one who felt remorse for wandering
from the straight path. She had swum the stream, and was doubtless
before the MacClaskey cabin at that moment.</p>

<p>But standing close to the edge of the creek, the boys became
aware of a hard fact: it had not only risen with great rapidity
during the last half hour, so as to become a rushing torrent,
but it was still rising so fast that it was extremely dangerous
for the boys to try to cross it in the canoe. Indeed, they hesitated
to make the attempt, but finally concluded to do so.</p>
