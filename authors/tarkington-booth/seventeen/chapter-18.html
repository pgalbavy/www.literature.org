<p>In the morning sunshine, Mrs. Baxter stood at the top of the
steps of the front porch, addressing her son, who listened impatiently
and edged himself a little nearer the gate every time he shifted
his weight from one foot to the other.</p>

<p>"Willie," she said, "you must really pay some attention to the
laws of health, or you'll never live to be an old man."</p>

<p>"I don't want to live to be an old man," said William, earnestly.
"I'd rather do what I please now and die a little sooner."</p>

<p>"You talk very foolishly," his mother returned. "Either come
back and put on some heavier <em>THINGS </em>or take your overcoat."</p>

<p>"My overcoat!" William groaned. "They'd think I was a lunatic,
carrying an overcoat in August!"</p>

<p>"Not to a picnic," she said.</p>

<p>"Mother, it isn't a picnic, I've told you a hunderd times! You
think it's one those ole-fashion things <em>YOU </em>used to go
to&mdash;sit on the damp ground and eat sardines with ants all over
'em? This isn't anything like that; we just go out on the trolley
to this farm-house and have noon dinner, and dance all afternoon,
and have supper, and then come home on the trolley. I guess we'd
hardly of got up anything as out o' date as a picnic in honor
of Miss <em>PRATT</em>!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter seemed unimpressed.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter whether you call it a picnic or not, Willie.
It will be cool on the open trolleycar coming home, especially
with only those white trousers on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ye gods!" he cried. "I've got other things on besides my trousers!
I wish you wouldn't always act as if I was a perfect child! Good
heavens! isn't a person my age supposed to know how much clothes
to wear?"</p>

<p>"Well, if he is," she returned, "it's a mere supposition and
not founded on fact. Don't get so excited, Willie, please; but
you'll either have to give up the picnic or come in and ch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Change my 'things'!" he wailed. "I can't change my 'things'!
I've got just twenty minutes to get to May Parcher's&mdash;the crowd
meets there, and they're goin' to take the trolley in front the
Parchers' at exactly a quarter after 'leven. <em>PLEASE </em>don't
keep me any longer, mother &mdash;I <em>GOT </em>to go!"</p>

<p>She stepped into the hall and returned immediately. "Here's your
overcoat, Willie."</p>

<p>His expression was of despair. "They'll think I'm a lunatic and
they'll say so before everybody&mdash;and I don't blame 'em! Overcoat
on a hot day like this! Except me, I don't suppose there was ever
anybody lived in the world and got to be going on eighteen years
old and had to carry his silly old overcoat around with him in
August&mdash;because his mother made him!"</p>

<p>"Willie," said Mrs. Baxter, "you don't know how many thousands
and thousands of mothers for thousands and thousands of years
have kept their sons from taking thousands and thousands of colds&mdash;just
this way!"</p>

<p>He moaned. "Well, and I got to be called a lunatic just because
you're nervous, I s'pose. All right!"</p>

<p>She hung it upon his arm, kissed him; and he departed in a desperate
manner.</p>

<p>However, having worn his tragic face for three blocks, he halted
before a corner drug-store, and permitted his expression to improve
as he gazed upon the window display of My Little Sweetheart All-Tobacco
Cuban Cigarettes, the Package of Twenty for Ten Cents. William
was not a smoker&mdash;that is to say, he had made the usual boyhood
experiments, finding them discouraging; and though at times he
considered it humorously man-about-town to say to a smoking friend,
"Well, <em>I</em>'ll tackle one o' your ole coffin-nails," he
had never made a purchase of tobacco in his life. But it struck
him now that it would be rather debonair to disport himself with
a package of Little Sweethearts upon the excursion.</p>

<p>And the name! It thrilled him inexpressibly, bringing a tenderness
into his eyes and a glow into his bosom. He felt that when he
should smoke a Little Sweetheart it would be a tribute to the
ineffable visitor for whom this party was being given&mdash;it would
bring her closer to him. His young brow grew almost stern with
determination, for he made up his mind, on the spot, that he would
smoke oftener in the future&mdash;he would become a confirmed smoker,
and all his life he would smoke My Little Sweetheart All-Tobacco
Cuban Cigarettes.</p>

<p>He entered and managed to make his purchase in a matter-of-fact
way, as if he were doing something quite unemotional; then he
said to the clerk:</p>

<p>"Oh, by the by&mdash;ah&mdash;"</p>

<p>The clerk stared. "Well, what else?"</p>

<p>"I mean," said William, hurriedly, "there's something I wanted
to 'tend to, now I happen to be here. I was on my way to take
this overcoat to&mdash;to get something altered at the tailor's for
next winter. 'Course I wouldn't want it till winter, but I thought
I might as well get it <em>DONE." </em>He paused, laughing carelessly,
for greater plausibility. "I thought he'd prob'ly want lots of
time on the job&mdash;he's a slow worker, I've noticed&mdash;and so I decided
I might just as well go ahead and let him get at it. Well, so
I was on my way there, but I just noticed I only got about six
minutes more to get to a mighty important engagement I got this
morning, and I'd like to leave it here and come by and get it
on my way home, this evening."</p>

<p>"Sure," said the clerk. "Hang it on that hook inside the p'scription-counter.
There's one there already, b'longs to your friend, that young
Bullitt fella. He was in here awhile ago and said he wanted to
leave his because he didn't have time to take it to be pressed
in time for next winter. Then he went on and joined that crowd
in Mr. Parcher's yard, around the corner, that's goin' on a trolley-party.
I says, 'I betcher mother maje carry it,' and he says, 'Oh no.
Oh no,' he says. 'Honest, I was goin' to get it pressed!' You
can hang yours on the same nail."</p>

<p>The clerk spoke no more, and went to serve another customer,
while William stared after him a little uneasily. It seemed that
here was a man of suspicious nature, though, of course, Joe Bullitt's
shallow talk about getting an overcoat pressed before winter would
not have imposed upon anybody. However, William felt strongly
that the private life of the customers of a store should not be
pried into and speculated about by employees, and he was conscious
of a distaste for this clerk.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was with a lighter heart that he left his overcoat
behind him and stepped out of the side door of the drug-store.
That brought him within sight of the gaily dressed young people,
about thirty in number, gathered upon the small lawn beside Mr.
Parcher's house.</p>

<p>Miss Pratt stood among them, in heliotrope and white, Flopit
nestling in her arms. She was encircled by girls who were enthusiastically
caressing the bored and blinking Flopit; and when William beheld
this charming group, his breath became eccentric, his knee-caps
became cold and convulsive, his neck became hot, and he broke
into a light perspiration.</p>

<p>She saw him! The small blonde head and the delirious little fluffy
hat above it shimmered a nod to him. Then his mouth fell unconsciously
open, and his eyes grew glassy with the intensity of meaning he
put into the silent response he sent across the picket fence and
through the interstices of the intervening group. Pressing with
his elbow upon the package of cigarettes in his pocket, he murmured,
inaudibly, "My Little Sweetheart, always for you!"&mdash;a repetition
of his vow that, come what might, he would forever remain a loyal
smoker of that symbolic brand. In fact, William's mental condition
had never shown one moment's turn for the better since the fateful
day of the distracting visitor's arrival.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnnie Watson and Mr. Joe Bullitt met him at the gate and
offered him hearty greeting. All bickering and dissension among
these three had passed. The lady was so wondrous impartial that,
as time went on, the sufferers had come to be drawn together,
rather than thrust asunder, by their common feeling. It had grown
to be a bond uniting them; they were not so much rivals as ardent
novices serving a single altar, each worshiping there without
visible gain over the other. Each had even come to possess, in
the eyes of his two fellows, almost a sacredness as a sharer in
the celestial glamor; they were tender one with another. They
were in the last stages.</p>

<p>Johnnie Watson had with him to-day a visitor of his own&mdash;a vastly
overgrown person of eighteen, who, at Johnnie's beckoning, abandoned
a fair companion of the moment and came forward as William entered
the gate.</p>

<p>"I want to intradooce you to two of my most int'mut friends,
George,"  said Johnnie, with the anxious gravity of a person about
to do something important and unfamiliar. "Mr. Baxter, let me
intradooce my cousin, Mr. Crooper. Mr. Crooper, this is my friend,
Mr. Baxter."</p>

<p>The gentlemen shook hands solemnly, saying,</p>

<p>"'M very glad to meet you," and Johnnie turned to Joe Bullitt.
"Mr. Croo&mdash;I mean, Mr. Bullitt, let me intradooce my friend, Mr.
Crooper &mdash;I mean my cousin, Mr. Crooper. Mr. Crooper is a
cousin of mine."</p>

<p>"Glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Crooper," said Joe. "I suppose
you're a cousin of Johnnie's, then?"</p>

<p>"Yep," said Mr. Crooper, becoming more informal. "Johnnie wrote
me to come over for this shindig, so I thought I might as well
come."  He laughed loudly, and the others laughed with the same
heartiness. "Yessir," he added, "I thought I might as well come,
'cause I'm pretty apt to be on hand if there's anything doin'!"</p>

<p>"Well, that's right," said William, and while they all laughed
again, Mr. Crooper struck his cousin a jovial blow upon the back.</p>

<p>"Hi, ole sport!" he cried, "I want to meet that Miss Pratt before
we start. The car'll be along pretty soon, and I got her picked
for the girl I'm goin' to sit by."</p>

<p>The laughter of William and Joe Bullitt, designed to express
cordiality, suddenly became flaccid and died. If Mr. Crooper had
been a sensitive person he might have perceived the chilling disapproval
in their glances, for they had just begun to be most unfavorably
impressed with him. The careless loudness&mdash;almost the notoriety&mdash;with
which he had uttered Miss Pratt's name, demanding loosely to be
presented to her, regardless of the well-known law that a lady
must first express some wish in such matters&mdash;these were indications
of a coarse nature sure to be more than uncongenial to Miss Pratt.
Its presence might make the whole occasion distasteful to her&mdash;might
spoil her day. Both William and Joe Bullitt began to wonder why
on earth Johnnie Watson didn't have any more sense than to invite
such a big, fat lummox of a cousin to the party.</p>

<p>This severe phrase of theirs, almost simultaneous in the two
minds, was not wholly a failure as a thumb-nail sketch of Mr.
George Crooper. And yet there was the impressiveness of size about
him, especially about his legs and chin. At seventeen and eighteen
growth is still going on, sometimes in a sporadic way, several
parts seeming to have sprouted faster than others. Often the features
have not quite settled down together in harmony, a mouth, for
instance, appearing to have gained such a lead over the rest of
a face, that even a mother may fear it can never be overtaken.
Voices, too, often seem misplaced; one hears, outside the door,
the bass rumble of a sinister giant, and a mild boy, thin as a
cricket, walks in. The contrary was George Crooper's case; his
voice was an unexpected piping tenor, half falsetto and frequently
girlish&mdash;as surprising as the absurd voice of an elephant.</p>

<p>He had the general outwardness of a vast and lumpy child. His
chin had so distanced his other features that his eyes, nose,
and brow seemed almost baby-like in comparison, while his mountainous
legs were the great part of the rest of him. He was one of those
huge, bottle-shaped boys who are always in motion in spite of
their cumbersomeness. His gestures were continuous, though difficult
to interpret as bearing upon the subject of his equally continuous
conversation; and under all circumstances he kept his conspicuous
legs incessantly moving, whether he was going anywhere or remaining
in comparatively one spot.</p>

<p>His expression was pathetically offensive, the result of his
bland confidence in the audible opinions of a small town whereof
his father was the richest inhabitant&mdash;and the one thing about
him, even more obvious than his chin, his legs, and his spectacular
taste in flannels, was his perfect trust that he was as welcome
to every one as he was to his mother. This might some day lead
him in the direction of great pain, but on the occasion of the
"subscription party" for Miss Pratt it gave him an advantage.</p>

<p>"When do I get to meet that cutie?" he insisted, as Johnnie Watson
moved backward from the cousinly arm, which threatened further
flailing. "You intradooced me to about seven I can't do much <em>FOR,
</em>but I want to get the howdy business over with this Miss
Pratt, so I and she can get things started. I'm goin' to keep
her busy all day!"</p>

<p>"Well, don't be in such a hurry," said Johnnie, uneasily. "You
can meet her when we get out in the country&mdash;if I get a chance,
George."</p>

<p>"No, sir!" George protested, jovially. "I guess you're sad birds
over in this town, but look out! When I hit a town it don't take
long till they all hear there's something doin'! You know how
I am when I get started, Johnnie!" Here he turned upon William,
tucking his fat arm affectionately through William's thin one.
"Hi, sport! Ole Johnnie's so slow, <em>YOU </em>toddle me over
and get me fixed up with this Miss Pratt, and I'll tell her you're
the real stuff&mdash;after we get engaged!"</p>

<p>He was evidently a true cloud-compeller, this horrible George.</p>
