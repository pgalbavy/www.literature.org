<p><em>DAY </em>broke over the city. A cloudy day, with a mist
that enveloped everything in a sinister manner. The sun tried
in vain to penetrate that sombre atmosphere.</p>

<p>Mid-day showed a dark red ball, rolling ingloriously in a sulphurous
light. Such was the picture of the heavens that day.</p>

<p>Théophraste sprang out of bed early, and awoke Marceline suddenly
by an excess of foolish hilarity. Marceline inquired the reason
for such strange joyfulness. He said that he could not help laughing
at the idea of M. Milfroid, the Commissioner of Police, receiving
back the stolen goods which had been pickpocketed right before
his very eyes. "My dear Marceline," he said, "it is foolish, the
way people carry the money in their pockets. If you cannot put
your hand in, slip a straw, filled with glue, in. It is an excellent
scheme for extricating money from people’s pockets."</p>

<p>Marceline sat up and gazed at him. She could not understand,
as he never looked more natural in his life, and yet he was saying
peculiar things, and his words were most unnatural.</p>

<p>"Théophraste, you frighten me," she cried, and in her fear, groaned,
"My poor child."</p>

<p>Théophraste grew terribly angry. He threw himself at his wife,
and threatened to strike her. "You know perfectly well that I
do not wish to be called a child since the death of Jeanneton-Venes.
I am no child."</p>

<p>Marceline swore that she would never do it again, and in the
depths of her soul regretted the unlucky moment which had given
her husband proprietorship of a document which had brought into
the household such fears and such follies. She knew neither Marie
Antoinette, nor Jeanneton-Venes, although he continually referred
to them. He had a familiar way of expressing himself about these
women which made her uneasy, and finally the unexpected sentences,
spoken by Théophraste, and his actions, made her dread the incomprehensible
Théophraste of two hundred years ago. It made her long for the
former Théophraste, so kind, so easy to understand. Then she gave
herself up to bitter reflections upon the theory of reincarnation.</p>

<p>Théophraste finished dressing, and then announcing that he would
not breakfast at home, said that he had a rendezvous with his
friend Va-de-Bon Cœur, at the corner of the Rue Mazarin and Rue
Guinegaud, to do a good turn for M. de Francouse, but as that
rendezvous was after breakfast, he intended enjoying the air in
the Moulin de Chopinette.</p>

<p>"You will leave my green umbrella here," he said, "and I will
take my black feather." Then, putting the final touches to his
cravat, he went out. On the landing he met Signor Petito, the
Italian professor, who was also going downstairs. Signor Petito
bowed very low, complained of the state of the weather, and complimented
Théophraste on his appearance.</p>

<p>Théophraste answered in a less amiable tone, as he was not desiring
the Signor’s company, and he demanded of him if Madame Petito
could not be induced to learn another air on the piano than "Carnival
de Venice." But Signor Petito replied, smiling, that she was already
studying "Love’s Destiny," but in future she would study only
the pieces which would please M. Longuet. He then asked, "Which
way are you going?"</p>

<p>"For a turn in the Moulin de Chopinette; but the weather is too
bad, so I will have to go down to the Porcherons."</p>

<p>"To the Porcherons?" Signor Petito was going to ask, but he changed
his mind. "Where is the Porcherons?" he asked. "I will go, too."</p>

<p>"Aha, indeed!" said M. Longuet, glancing curiously at Signor
Petito. "You too will go to the Porcherons?"</p>

<p>"Go there or somewhere else," said Signor Petito, pleasantly,
and he followed Théophraste.</p>

<p>At the end of a short silence Signor Petito ventured to ask,
"Where are your treasures, M. Longuet?"</p>

<p>Théophraste faced about suddenly. "What has put such an idea
into your head?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Do you not remember the day that you brought the specimen of
your handwriting and asked for my opinion?"</p>

<p>"I remember, and you were wrong," said Théophraste drily, as
he opened his umbrella.</p>

<p>Signor Petito, in nowise discouraged, placed himself under the
shelter of Théophraste’s umbrella. "Oh! M. Longuet, I did not
say that to annoy you."</p>

<p>They arrived at the corner of the Avenue Tre-daine. Théophraste
was in very bad humor.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he said, "I have an appointment at the tavern of
the Veau-qui-telle, by the side of the Chapel Porcherons, here,
you see."</p>

<p>"But we are at the Chapel Notre Dame de Lor-rete, and not the
Porcherons, at all."</p>

<p>Théophraste disregarded Petito’s remark, and suddenly said to
him, "Do you know that there is a price on my head?"</p>

<p>Signor Petito seemed taken aback by this sudden change of tone.</p>

<p>"It will cost them dear, though, to get my head," said Théophraste.
"Do you know how much it will cost, Signor, the head of L’Enfant?
No? Very well. I am going to tell you, since the occasion has
presented itself, and I am going to tell you the whole story,
which may be profitable to you."</p>

<p>Then, without any preparation, he related in the most natural
way possible, his existence previous to his present one.</p>

<p>"My head is worth 20,000 pounds," said he, "and you know it very
well." And as he pronounced these words he struck the table such
a blow that Signor Petito recoiled instinctively.</p>

<p>"Here is the history of it all. I was walking, two hundred years
ago, in the Rue de Vauregard, with my hands in my pocket, without
arms, without even a sword, with the most honest intentions in
the world, when a man met me. He bowed almost to the ground, and
told me that my face reminded him so much of some one he knew.
He was called ‘Old Man Bidel,’ or ‘Bidel the Good-natured,’ and
he said that he had a secret to confide to me.</p>

<p>I encouraged him by a friendly tap on the shoulder, and he confided
his secret to me. He whispered in my ear that the Regent had promised
twenty thousand pounds to whoever would arrest the Enfant, and
he knew where the Enfant was hiding. That I looked to him like
a man of courage, and that he, with my aid, would do anything
to get the 20,000 pounds. He said that he would divide the reward.</p>

<p>"The old man Bidel was on the wrong track, Signor Petito, for
I also knew where to find L’Enfant, seeing that I was that person."</p>

<p>Signor Petito did not wish to believe any of this, as he could
see for himself that M. Longuet had been out of infancy a good
many years. However, he dared not say anything. Théophraste continued,
"I replied to the old man Bidel, that it was a happy chance and
that I thanked Heaven for putting him in my path, and I made him
conduct me to the place where he could find the Enfaut. He said
to me, ‘To-night, the Enfant sleeps at the Capucine, in the Tavern
Suite, which bears as a sign the Cross of the St. Hester.’</p>

<p>"It was true, Signor Petito, the old man Bidel was very well
informed. I congratulated him, and we passed just then a cutlery
shop, and I bought a small knife, much to the astonishment of
Bidel, who asked me what I planned to do with such a weapon. I
replied to him that with a small knife like this one could kill
a fly, and I plunged it into his heart. He sank down, raised his
arms wildly for a few moments, and died."</p>

<p>Signor Petito, who at first had moved away from Théophraste,
now rose and ran to the door, and was glad to get out of sight.</p>

<p>M. Longuet drank his wine, got up and went to the Bousset Brewery,
where Mme. Barth was standing, making up her books. He said to
her, "Mme. Taconet&#11834;"</p>

<p>Mme. Barth demanded why he called her Mine. Taconet, but he disregarded
her question, and continued, "If Signor Petito comes here again,
you will tell him for me that the first time I find him in my
way, I will cut his ears off." Saying this, Théophraste fondled
the handle of his umbrella as one grasps the handle of a dagger.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it, he had his black plume. He had become
the Other entirely.</p>

<p>The fog was still thick and he did not think of breakfasting
yet. He walked into the sulphurous mist like one in a dream. He
crossed the whole of the Quarter of An tin, and that which was
formerly the Avenue L’Enrique, until he came under the shadows
of the towers of Trinity, which he called the Chateau du Coq.
On his arrival at the St. Lazare, he believed that he was at the
Petite Pologue.</p>

<p>But little by little the fog cleared away, and his dream disappeared
with it. He had the most exact idea of things when he crossed
the Point Royale, and by the time he had set foot on the left
bank, he was again the honest Théophraste, and had only the vaguest
idea of that which had happened on the right bank. But he could
remember this, and when he questioned himself thoroughly, he began
to experience the different conditions or states of the soul.
He discovered in himself three distinct states. First, that which
resulted from his life as an actuality, the honest merchant; second,
that which resulted from the sudden and momentary resurrection
of the Other; and third, that which resulted from memory. The
recollection was to him like a third Théophraste, who related
to the first what he had known of the second. This resurrection
of Théophraste’s was a terrible thing.</p>

<p>On crossing the Bridge he hurried beyond the Rue Guinegaud. He
did not care to pass by the corner of the Rue Mazarin, he knew
not why. He turned the corner by the Hotel Monniare, and almost
ran into Adolphe, who was waiting for him there.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of a person called L’Enfant, my dear Adolphe?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes," said Aldolphe, "I have heard of him. I even know
his real name, his family name."</p>

<p>"Ah, what is it?" anxiously inquired Théophraste.</p>

<p>Adolphe for reply pushed Théophraste into the hallway of an old
house, in the Rue Guinegard, a few steps from the Hotel de la
Monniare. They climbed a tottering staircase, and entered a room
in which the curtains were drawn. Somebody had spent the night
in the room.</p>

<p>On a little table in the corner, the trembling flame of a wax
candle lit up a portrait. It was the picture of a man about thirty
years of age. He had a robust figure, high forehead, strong nose,
a smooth chin, and large mouth and moustache. His thick hair was
covered by a coarse woolen cap, and he wore a coat over a coarse
linen shirt, which appeared to be a prison garb.</p>

<p>"Wait," said Théophraste, without raising his tone, "how is it
that my portrait is in this house?"</p>

<p>"Your picture?" asked Adolphe. "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Who could be more sure of it than I?" said Théophraste again,
without being excited.</p>

<p>"Very well," said M. Lecamus, with emotions that it would be
hard to describe. "That portrait, which is your portrait, is the
portrait of Cartouche." When M. Lecamus turned to see the effect
his words would produce on his friend, he saw Théophraste stretched
on the floor in a dead swoon.</p>

<p>For a long time he worked to bring him to. He blew out the candle
and opened the windows, allowing the good air to come in. Théophraste
came to himself, and his first words were, "Adolphe, above all
things do not speak of this to my wife."</p>
