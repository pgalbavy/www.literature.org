<p>It is probable that Sir Archibald Roylance did not altogether
believe Dickson's tale; it may be that he considered him an agreeable
romancer, or a little mad, or no more than a relief to the tedium
of a wet Sunday morning. But his incredulity did not survive one
glance at Saskia as she stood in that bleak drawing-room among
Victorian water-colours and faded chintzes. The young man's boyishness
deserted him. He stopped short in his tracks, and made a profound
and awkward bow. "I am at your service, Mademoiselle," he said,
amazed at himself. The words seemed to have come out of a confused
memory of plays and novels.</p>

<p>She inclined her head&mdash;a little on one side, and looked towards
Dickson.</p>

<p>"Sir Archibald's going to do his best for us," said that squire
of dames. "I was telling him that we had had our breakfast."</p>

<p>"Let's get out of this sepulchre," said their host, who was recovering
himself. "There's a roasting fire in my den. Of course you'll
have something to eat&mdash;hot coffee, anyhow &mdash;I've trained
my cook to make coffee like a Frenchwoman. The housekeeper will
take charge of you, if you want to tidy up, and you must excuse
our ramshackle ways, please. I don't believe there's ever been
a lady in this house before, you know."</p>

<p>He led her to the smoking-room and ensconced her in the great
chair by the fire. Smilingly she refused a series of offers which
ranged from a sheepskin mantle which he had got in the Pamirs
and which he thought might fit her, to hot whisky and water as
a specific against a chill. But she accepted a pair of slippers
and deftly kicked off the brogues provided by Mrs. Morran. Also,
while Dickson started rapaciously on a second breakfast, she allowed
him to pour her out a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>"You are a soldier?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Two years infantry&mdash;5th Battalion Lennox Highlanders, and then
Flying Corps. Top-hole time I had too, till the day before the
Armistice when my luck gave out and I took a nasty toss. Consequently
I'm not as fast on my legs now as I'd like to be."</p>

<p>"You were a friend of Captain Kennedy?"</p>

<p>"His oldest. We were at the same private school, and he was at
m' tutor's, and we were never much separated till he went abroad
to cram for the Diplomatic and I started east to shoot things."</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you what I told Captain Kennedy." Saskia, looking
into the heart of the peats, began the story of which we have
already heard a version, but she told it differently, for she
was telling it to one who more or less belonged to her own world.
She mentioned names at which the other nodded. She spoke of a
certain Paul Abreskov. "I heard of him at Bokhara in 1912," said
Sir Archie, and his face grew solemn. Sometimes she lapsed into
French, and her hearer's brow wrinkled, but he appeared to follow.
When she had finished he drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"My Aunt! What a time you've been through! I've seen pluck in
my day, but yours! It's not thinkable. D'you mind if I ask a question,
Princess? Bolshevism we know all about, and I admit Trotsky and
his friends are a pretty effective push; but how on earth have
they got a world-wide graft going in the time so that they can
stretch their net to an out-of-the-way spot like this? It looks
as if they had struck a Napoleon somewhere."</p>

<p>"You do not understand," she said. "I cannot make any one understand&mdash;except
a Russian. My country has been broken to pieces, and there is
no law in it; therefore it is a nursery of crime. So would England
be, or France, if you had suffered the same misfortunes. My people
are not wickeder than others, but for the moment they are sick
and have no strength. As for the government of the Bolsheviki
it matters little, for it will pass. Some parts of it may remain,
but it is a government of the sick and fevered, and cannot endure
in health. Lenin may be a good man &mdash;I do not think so, but
I do not know&mdash;but if he were an archangel he could not alter
things. Russia is mortally sick and therefore all evil is unchained,
and the criminals have no one to check them. There is crime everywhere
in the world, and the unfettered crime in Russia is so powerful
that it stretches its hand to crime throughout the globe and there
is a great mobilising everywhere of wicked men. Once you boasted
that law was international and that the police in one land worked
with the police of all others. To-day that is true about criminals.
After a war evil passions are loosed, and, since Russia is broken,
in her they can make their headquarters.... It is not Bolshevism,
the theory, you need fear, for that is a weak and dying thing.
It is crime, which to-day finds its seat in my country, but is
not only Russian. It has no fatherland. It is as old as human
nature and as wide as the earth."</p>

<p>"I see," said Sir Archie. "Gad, here have I been vegetatin' and
thinkin' that all excitement had gone out of life with the war,
and sometimes even regrettin' that the beastly old thing was over,
and all the while the world fairly hummin' with interest. And
Loudon too!"</p>

<p>"I would like your candid opinion on yon factor, Sir Archibald,"
said Dickson.</p>

<p>"I can't say I ever liked him, and I've once or twice had a row
with him, for he used to bring his pals to shoot over Dalquharter
and he didn't quite play the game by me. But I know dashed little
about him, for I've been a lot away. Bit hairy about the heels,
of course. A great figure at local race-meetin's, and used to
toady old Carforth and the huntin' crowd. He has a pretty big
reputation as a sharp lawyer and some of the thick-headed lairds
swear by him, but Quentin never could stick him. It's quite likely
he's been gettin' into Queer Street, for he was always speculatin'
in horse-flesh, and I fancy he plunged a bit on the Turf. But
I can't think how he got mixed up in this show."</p>

<p>"I'm positive Dobson's his brother."</p>

<p>"And put this business in his way. That would explain it all
right.... He must be runnin' for pretty big stakes, for that kind
of lad don't dabble in crime for six-and-eightpence.... Now for
the layout. You've got three men shut up in Dalquharter House,
who by this time have probably escaped. One of you&mdash;what's his
name? &mdash;Heritage?&mdash;is in the old Tower, and you think that
<em>they</em> think the Princess is still there and will sit round
the place like terriers. Sometime to-day the Danish brig will
arrive with reinforcements, and then there will be a hefty fight.
Well, the first thing to be done is to get rid of Loudon's stymie
with the authorities. Princess, I'm going to carry you off in
my car to the Chief Constable. The second thing is for you after
that to stay on here. It's a deadly place on a wet day, but it's
safe enough."</p>

<p>Saskia shook her head and Dickson spoke for her.</p>

<p>"You'll no' get her to stop here. I've done my best, but she's
determined to be back at Dalquharter. You see she's expecting
a friend, and besides, if there's going to be a battle she'd like
to be in it. Is that so, Mem?"</p>

<p>Sir Archie looked helplessly around him, and the sight of the
girl's face convinced him that argument would be fruitless. "Anyhow
she must come with me to the Chief Constable. Lethington's a slow
bird on the wing, and I don't see myself convincin' him that he
must get busy unless I can produce the Princess. Even then it
may be a tough job, for it's Sunday, and in these parts people
go to sleep till Monday mornin'."</p>

<p>"That's just what I'm trying to get at," said Dickson. "By all
means go to the Chief Constable, and tell him it's life or death.
My lawyer in Glasgow, Mr. Caw, will have been stirring him up
yesterday, and you two should complete the job.... But what I'm
feared is that he'll not be in time. As you say, it's the Sabbath
day, and the police are terrible slow. Now any moment that brig
may be here, and the trouble will start. I'm wanting to save the
Princess, but I'm wanting too to give these blagyirds the roughest
handling they ever got in their lives. Therefore I say there's
no time to lose. We're far ower few to put up a fight, and we
want every man you've got about this place to hold the fort till
the police come."</p>

<p>Sir Archibald looked upon the earnest flushed face of Dickson
with admiration. "I'm blessed if you're not the most whole-hearted
brigand I've ever struck."</p>

<p>"I'm not. I'm just a business man."</p>

<p>"Do you realise that you're levying a private war and breaking
every law of the land?"</p>

<p>"Hoots!" said Dickson. "I don't care a docken about the law.
I'm for seeing this job through. What force can you produce?"</p>

<p>"Only cripples, I'm afraid. There's Sime, my butler. He was a
Fusilier Jock and, as you saw, has lost an arm. Then McGuffog
the keeper is a good man, but he's still got a Turkish bullet
in his thigh. The chauffeur, Carfrae, was in the Yeomanry, and
lost half a foot, and there's myself, as lame as a duck. The herds
on the home farm are no good, for one's seventy and the other
is in bed with jaundice. The Mains can produce four men, but they're
rather a job lot."</p>

<p>"They'll do fine," said Dickson heartily. "All sodgers, and no
doubt all good shots. Have you plenty guns?"</p>

<p>Sir Archie burst into uproarious laughter. "Mr. McCunn, you're
a man after my own heart. I'm under your orders. If I had a boy
I'd put him into the provision trade, for it's the place to see
fightin'. Yes, we've no end of guns. I advise shot-guns, for they've
more stoppin' power in a rush than a rifle, and I take it it's
a rough-and-tumble we're lookin' for."</p>

<p>"Right," said Dickson. "I saw a bicycle in the hall. I want you
to lend it me, for I must be getting back. You'll take the Princess
and do the best you can with the Chief Constable."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then you'll load up your car with your folk, and come down the
hill to Dalquharter. There'll be a laddie, or maybe more than
one, waiting for you on this side the village to give you instructions.
Take your orders from them. If it's a red-haired ruffian called
Dougal you'll be wise to heed what he says, for he has a grand
head for battles."</p>

<p>Five minutes later Dickson was pursuing a quavering course like
a snipe down the avenue. He was a miserable performer on a bicycle.
Not for twenty years had he bestridden one, and he did not understand
such new devices as free-wheels and change of gears. The mounting
had been the worst part and it had only been achieved by the help
of a rockery. He had begun by cutting into two flower-beds, and
missing a birch tree by inches. But he clung on desperately, well
knowing that if he fell off it would be hard to remount, and at
length he gained the avenue. When he passed the lodge gates he
was riding fairly straight, and when he turned off the Ayr highway
to the side road that led to Dalquharter he was more or less master
of his machine.</p>

<p>He crossed the Garple by an ancient hunch-backed bridge, observing
even in his absorption with the handle-bars that the stream was
in roaring spate. He wrestled up the further hill, with aching
calf-muscles, and got to the top just before his strength gave
out. Then as the road turned seaward he had the slope with him,
and enjoyed some respite. It was no case for putting up his feet,
for the gale was blowing hard on his right cheek, but the downward
grade enabled him to keep his course with little exertion. His
anxiety to get back to the scene of action was for the moment
appeased, since he knew he was making as good speed as the weather
allowed, so he had leisure for thought.</p>

<p>But the mind of this preposterous being was not on the business
before him. He dallied with irrelevant things&mdash;with the problems
of youth and love. He was beginning to be very nervous about Heritage,
not as the solitary garrison of the old Tower, but as the lover
of Saskia. That everybody should be in love with her appeared
to him only proper, for he had never met her like, and assumed
that it did not exist. The desire of the moth for the star seemed
to him a reasonable thing, since hopeless loyalty and unrequited
passion were the eternal stock-in-trade of romance. He wished
he were twenty-five himself to have the chance of indulging in
such sentimentality for such a lady. But Heritage was not like
him and would never be content with a romantic folly.... He had
been in love with her for two years&mdash;a long time. He spoke about
wanting to die for her, which was a flight beyond Dickson himself.
"I doubt it will be what they call a 'grand passion,'" he reflected
with reverence. But it was hopeless; he saw quite clearly that
it was hopeless.</p>

<p>Why, he could not have explained, for Dickson's instincts were
subtler than his intelligence. He recognised that the two belonged
to different circles of being, which nowhere intersected. That
mysterious lady, whose eyes had looked through life to the other
side, was no mate for the Poet. His faithful soul was agitated,
for he had developed for Heritage a sincere affection. It would
break his heart, poor man. There was he holding the fort alone
and cheering himself with delightful fancies about one remoter
than the moon. Dickson wanted happy endings, and here there was
no hope of such. He hated to admit that life could be crooked,
but the optimist in him was now fairly dashed.</p>

<p>Sir Archie might be the fortunate man, for of course he would
soon be in love with her, if he were not so already. Dickson like
all his class had a profound regard for the country gentry. The
business Scot does not usually revere wealth, though he may pursue
it earnestly, nor does he specially admire rank in the common
sense. But for ancient race he has respect in his bones, though
it may happen that in public he denies it, and the laird has for
him a secular association with good family.... Sir Archie might
do. He was young, good-looking, obviously gallant.... But no!
He was not quite right either. Just a trifle too light in weight,
too boyish and callow. The Princess must have youth, but it should
be mighty youth, the youth of a Napoleon or a Cæsar. He reflected
that the Great Montrose, for whom he had a special veneration,
might have filled the bill. Or young Harry with his beaver up?
Or Claverhouse in the picture with the flush of temper on his
cheek?</p>

<p>The meditations of the match-making Dickson came to an abrupt
end. He had been riding negligently, his head bent against the
wind, and his eyes vaguely fixed on the wet hill-gravel of the
road. Of his immediate environs he was pretty well unconscious.
Suddenly he was aware of figures on each side of him who advanced
menacingly. Stung to activity he attempted to increase his pace,
which was already good, for the road at this point descended steeply.
Then, before he could prevent it, a stick was thrust into his
front wheel, and the next second he was describing a curve through
the air. His head took the ground, he felt a spasm of blinding
pain, and then a sense of horrible suffocation before his wits
left him.</p>

<p>"Are ye sure it's the richt man, Ecky?" said a voice which he
did not hear.</p>

<p>"Sure. It's the Glesca body Dobson telled us to look for yesterday.
It's a pund note atween us for this job. We'll tie him up in the
wud till we've time to attend to him."</p>

<p>"Is he bad?"</p>

<p>"It doesna maitter," said the one called Ecky. "He'll be deid
onyway long afore the morn."</p>

</div>
<p>Mrs. Morran all forenoon was in a state of un-Sabbatical disquiet.
After she had seen Saskia and Dickson start she finished her housewifely
duties, took Cousin Eugènie her breakfast, and made preparation
for the midday dinner. The invalid in the bed in the parlour was
not a repaying subject. Cousin Eugènie belonged to that type of
elderly women who, having been spoiled in youth, find the rest
of life fall far short of their expectations. Her voice had acquired
a perpetual wail, and the corners of what had once been a pretty
mouth drooped in an eternal peevishness. She found herself in
a morass of misery and shabby discomfort, but had her days continued
in an even tenor she would still have lamented. "A dingy body,"
was Mrs. Morran's comment, but she laboured in kindness. Unhappily
they had no common language, and it was only by signs that the
hostess could discover her wants and show her goodwill. She fed
her and bathed her face, saw to the fire and left her to sleep.
"I'm boilin' a hen to mak' broth for your denner, Mem. Try and
get a bit sleep now." The purport of the advice was clear, and
Cousin Eugènie turned obediently on her pillow.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Morran's custom of a Sunday to spend the morning
in devout meditation. Some years before she had given up tramping
the five miles to kirk, on the ground that having been a regular
attendant for fifty years she had got all the good out of it that
was probable. Instead she read slowly aloud to herself the sermon
printed in a certain religious weekly which reached her every
Saturday, and concluded with a chapter or two of the Bible. But
to-day something had gone wrong with her mind. She could not follow
the thread of the Reverend Doctor MacMichael's discourse. She
could not fix her attention on the wanderings and misdeeds of
Israel as recorded in the Book of Exodus. She must always be getting
up to look at the pot on the fire, or to open the back door and
study the weather. For a little she fought against her unrest,
and then she gave up the attempt at concentration. She took the
big pot off the fire and allowed it to simmer, and presently she
fetched her boots and umbrella, and kilted her petticoats. "I'll
be none the waur o' a breath o' caller air," she decided.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing great guns but there was only the thinnest
sprinkle of rain. Sitting on the hen-house roof and munching a
raw turnip was a figure which she recognised as the smallest of
the Die-Hards. Between bites he was singing dolefully to the tune
of "Annie Laurie" one of the ditties of his quondam Sunday school:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"The Boorjoys' brays are bonny,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too-roo-ra-roo-raloo,<br/>
&nbsp;But the Worrkers o' the Worrld<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wull gar them a' look blue,<br/>
&nbsp;Wull gar them a' look blue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And droon them in the sea,<br/>
&nbsp;And&mdash;for bonnie Annie Laurie<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll lay me down and dee."

</p>
</div>
<p>"Losh, laddie," she cried, "that's cauld food for the stamach.
Come indoors about midday and I'll gie ye a plate o' broth!" The
Die-Hard saluted and continued on the turnip.</p>

<p>She took the Auchenlochan road across the Garple bridge, for
that was the best road to the Mains and by it Dickson and the
others might be returning. Her equanimity at all seasons was like
a Turk's, and she would not have admitted that anything mortal
had power to upset or excite her: nevertheless it was a fast-beating
heart that she now bore beneath her Sunday jacket. Great events,
she felt, were on the eve of happening, and of them she was a
part. Dickson's anxiety was hers, to bring things to a business-like
conclusion. The honour of Huntingtower was at stake and of the
old Kennedys. She was carrying out Mr. Quentin's commands, the
dead boy who used to clamour for her treacle scones. And there
was more than duty in it, for youth was not dead in her old heart,
and adventure had still power to quicken it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morran walked well, with the steady long paces of the Scots
countrywoman. She left the Auchenlochan road and took the side
path along the tableland to the Mains. But for the surge of the
gale and the far-borne boom of the furious sea there was little
noise; not a bird cried in the uneasy air. With the wind behind
her Mrs. Morran breasted the ascent till she had on her right
the moorland running south to the Lochan valley and on her left
Garple chafing in its deep forested gorges. Her eyes were quick
and she noted with interest a weasel creeping from a fern-clad
cairn. A little way on she passed an old ewe in difficulties and
assisted it to rise. "But for me, my wumman, ye'd hae been braxy
ere nicht," she told it as it departed bleating. Then she realised
that she had come a certain distance. "Losh, I maun be gettin'
back or the hen will be spiled," she cried, and was on the verge
of turning.</p>

<p>But something caught her eye a hundred yards further on the road.
It was something which moved with the wind like a wounded bird,
fluttering from the roadside to a puddle and then back to the
rushes. She advanced to it, missed it, and caught it.</p>

<p>It was an old dingy green felt hat, and she recognised it as
Dickson's.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morran's brain, after a second of confusion, worked fast
and clearly. She examined the road and saw that a little way on
the gravel had been violently agitated. She detected several prints
of hobnailed boots. There were prints too, on a patch of peat
on the south side behind a tall bank of sods. "That's where they
were hidin'," she concluded. Then she explored on the other side
in a thicket of hazels and wild raspberries, and presently her
perseverance was rewarded. The scrub was all crushed and pressed
as if several persons had been forcing a passage. In a hollow
was a gleam of something white. She moved towards it with a quaking
heart, and was relieved to find that it was only a new and expensive
bicycle with the front wheel badly buckled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morran delayed no longer. If she had walked well on her
out journey, she beat all records on the return. Sometimes she
would run till her breath failed; then she would slow down till
anxiety once more quickened her pace. To her joy on the Dalquharter
side of the Garple bridge she observed the figure of a Die-Hard.
Breathless, flushed, with her bonnet awry and her umbrella held
like a scimitar, she seized on the boy.</p>

<p>"Awfu' doin's! They've grippit Maister McCunn up the Mains road
just afore the second milestone and forenent the auld bucht. I
fund his hat, and a bicycle's lyin' broken in the wud. Haste ye,
man, and get the rest and awa' and seek him. It'll be the tinklers
frae the Dean. I'd gang mysel', but my legs are ower auld. Oh,
laddie, dinna stop to speir questions. They'll hae him murdered
or awa' to sea. And maybe the leddy was wi' him and they've got
them baith. Wae's me! Wae's me!"</p>

<p>The Die-Hard, who was Wee Jaikie, did not delay. His eyes had
filled with tears at her news, which we know to have been his
habit. When Mrs. Morran, after indulging in a moment of barbaric
keening, looked back the road she had come, she saw a small figure
trotting up the hill like a terrier who has been left behind.
As he trotted he wept bitterly. Jaikie was getting dangerous.</p>
