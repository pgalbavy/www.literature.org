<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Mike affected to be greatly embarrassed by the question of Nora
Friestone. He swallowed what seemed to be a lump rising in his
throat, grinned in a sickly way and then asked as if much distressed:</p>

<p>"Do ye insist on me answering yer quistion?"</p>

<p>"I do," she replied, with an expression of tremendous solemnity.</p>

<p>"Then I'll hev to own that I'm the champion post office robber
in Maine. It was mesilf that plundered three offices, each a hundred
miles from the ither, on the same night and burned up an old man,
his wife and siven children that vintured to dispoot me will.
I've been in the bus'ness iver since the year one and me home
is Murthersville at the head of Murthersville Creek in Murthersville
County."</p>

<p>Rising from his chair, Mike bowed low.</p>

<p>"I thrust I have answered yer quistions satisfactorily, Miss."</p>

<p>"You couldn't have done better&mdash;hello, Jim!"</p>

<p>This salutation was to a big gawky boy, who slouched through
the door, with the announcement:</p>

<p>"Wal, I'm ready: what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Who's yer frind?" asked Mike of Nora.</p>

<p>"He comes round each morning to take out and place the things
on the porch in front and brings them in again each evening"</p>

<p>"Jim," said Mike, addressing the gaping youngster, "ye're discharged
fur to-night. I'm doing yer job for the avening, but you git your
wages just the same."</p>

<p>With which Mike thrust his hand into his trousers pocket and
drew out one of the three silver quarters there, handing it to
the boy, who was too mystified to understand what it meant.</p>

<p>"Yaws," he said, with a silly grin, looking at the coin and then
clasping it tight; "what do yuh warnt me to dew?"</p>

<p>"Go right home to yer mommy and give her that quarter to save
up fur ye. Don't git gay on the road and buy a horse and wagon."</p>

<p>"Yaws, but&mdash;uh &mdash;I don't understand what yuh am drivin'
at."</p>

<p>"Ye don't understand anything in this wurruld and by yer looks
niver will."</p>

<p>"He means, Jim," interposed Nora, "that he will bring in the
things to-night for us, but you must come round in the morning
and set them out again. That's plain enough, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yaws&mdash;but what did he give me so much money fur? I hain't done
nothin' to earn it; I don't understand it."</p>

<p>"We all know that. Come wid me, James."</p>

<p>As Mike spoke, he slipped his arm under that of Jim and walked
to the door, not pausing until they stood on the porch.</p>

<p>"Now, James, tell me where ye live."</p>

<p>"Yaws, what fur?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I asked ye; out wid it!"</p>

<p>The lad pointed a crooked finger down the street to the left.</p>

<p>"Now, see how quick ye can git thar. Don't look back, and whin
ye tumbles over the doorsill, tell yer mither ye won't have any
wurruk to do here until to-morrer mornin'."</p>

<p>"Oh, yaws, I understand&mdash;why didn't ye say so afore?"</p>

<p>"'Cause ye wouldn't have understood if I did. Off wid ye!"</p>

<p>And to make sure of being obeyed, Mike gave him a push which
caused his dilapidated straw hat to fall off. He snatched it up
and broke into a lope, as if afraid of harm if he lingered longer
in the neighborhood of such strange doings.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Nora, if ye'll tell me where ye want these things
placed, I shall be honored by carrying 'em in fur ye."</p>

<p>Mike stood in the front door and looked down the big store to
Nora, at the rear, who called:</p>

<p>"Set them in the back part of the room right here where I'm standing."</p>

<p>"How can I put 'em there, if ye stand there?" asked Mike.</p>

<p>"I expect to get out of your way."</p>

<p>"Oh, yaws," remarked the youth, mimicking Jim, who had shown
so much mental bewilderment.</p>

<p>The task was easy. There were picks, shovels, rakes, hoes, spades,
pails, ice cream freezers, toy wagons with gilt letters, coils
of rope and the various articles displayed by most village or
country stores to attract custom. These were carried in by the
lusty Mike, a half dozen at a time, and set down somewhat loosely
at the rear, Nora making a few suggestions that were hardly needed.</p>

<p>While this was going on, the mother employed herself in locking
the safe for the night. It will be remembered that in addition
to the stamps and money belonging to the government and to herself,
a liberal amount was already there, the property of one of the
leading citizens of Beartown, who was glad to entrust it to the
keeping of the honest widow.</p>

<p>"I think," said the daughter when Mike had completed his work,
which took only a few minutes, "you have earned your supper."</p>

<p>"Ah, now what reward can equal the light of yer blue eyes and
the swate smile that shows the purtiest teeth in the State of
Maine?" was the instant inquiry in return.</p>

<p>The mother had just finished locking the safe, and, standing
up, she laughed in her gentle way and said:</p>

<p>"Surely you have kissed the blarney stone, Mike."</p>

<p>"I would have done the same had the chance been mine, which it
wasn't. Is there any more play that ye call wurruk which I can
do fur the likes of ye?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more, thank you. Nora and I will now close the store
and attend to preparing supper."</p>

<p>"And I'll bring me frinds to enj'y the same."</p>

<p>So Mike bade them good night for a brief while, and strode down
the road to find Alvin and Chester, whom, as you know, he met
on their way to look for him. The three lingered and chatted,
with the view of giving mother and daughter time in which to make
ready the evening meal.</p>

<p>Following a common fashion of the times, the veteran Carter Friestone,
in building his store and home, made the second story the living
room of the family. It could be reached by the stairs at the back
of the regular entrance, being through a narrow hall where visitors
rang a bell when they called.</p>

<p>The upper front apartment served for parlor and sitting room,
and was neatly furnished, one of the principal articles being
a piano. This was a birthday present to Nora, who was gifted with
a naturally sweet voice and received instruction from the schoolmistress
of Beartown. At the rear was the kitchen and dining room, with
two bedrooms between that and the parlor, facing each other across
the hall.</p>

<p>Nora answered the tinkle of the bell, and Alvin and Chester were
introduced to her under the light of the hanging lamp overhead.
The little party found the mother awaiting them at the head of
the stairs.</p>

<p>"Supper will be ready in a few minutes," she said. "Nora will
entertain you in the parlor until I call you."</p>

<p>The girl escorted them to the front room, where all sat down
and chatted with the cheery good nature proper in such a party
of young folks. Mike was at his best, and kept all laughing by
his drollery. Nora's merriment filled the room with music. Michael
had given his name soon after his entrance into the store, but
insisted that the way to pronounce it was "Mike," not "Michael."</p>

<p>"I never knew such a funny person," said Nora, after one of his
quaint remarks. "Mother and I took to him from the first."</p>

<p>"I find it's a common wakeness whereiver I go," said Mike gravely.</p>

<p>"We find him fairly good company," said Alvin. "He seems to have
been born that way and we can hardly blame him."</p>

<p>"He tries our patience very much," added Chester, "but we have
learned to bear the affliction."</p>

<p>"I wish you all lived in Beartown," said Nora impulsively, "and
that Mike would call to see us every day."</p>

<p>"Whisht, now," said he, lowering his voice. "Whin I strolled
through the town on me arrival, I was so chaarmed I began hunting
fur a house and property to buy fur me home. I sthruck the right
spot and made an offer to the owner of the same. I think we'll
come to tarms, being there's only a difference of a thrifle of
five or six thousand dollars in the price."</p>

<p>Mrs. Friestone now appeared with word that supper was waiting,
and all passed into the kitchen and dining room. Of course she
presided, Nora acting as waitress whenever necessary. Alvin and
Chester complimented their hostess on the excellence of the meal,
while Mike was so extravagant in his praise that they protested.
Alvin told the particulars of their trip in the launch from home
to Wiscasset and return, omitting of course all reference to Stockham
Calvert that would give a hint of his profession and his purpose
in making what looked like an aimless ramble through this portion
of Maine. The Captain was assured that his boat would not be disturbed
where it lay moored under the bank, and he and Chester gave no
further thought to it.</p>

<p>The group lingered long at the table, and at the close of the
meal Nora preceded them to the parlor, were she excused herself
in order to help her mother in washing the dishes and clearing
away things. The work was finished sooner than the friends expected,
and the happy party gathered in the parlor.</p>

<p>The presence of the musical instrument made its own suggestion,
and the lads insisted that Nora should favor them with a song
or two. She had the good taste to comply after a modest protest,
and gave them a treat. Her voice, as I have said, was of fine
quality though rather weak, and she sang several of the popular
songs of the day with exquisite expression. She was so warmly
applauded that she blushed and sang again until it was evident
to all she was tired.</p>

<p>"Now," said she as she rose from the stool and looked at Mike,
"you must sing for us, for I know you can."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mike, show them what you can do in that line," joined
Alvin, and Chester was equally urgent.</p>

<p>He objected and held back, but when Mrs. Friestone joined in
the request he rose reluctantly and went to the instrument.</p>

<p>And straightway came the surprise of the evening.</p>
