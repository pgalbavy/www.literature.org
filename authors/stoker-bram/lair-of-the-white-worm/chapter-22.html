"She has diabolical cunning," said Sir Nathaniel.  "Ever since you
left, she has ranged along the Brow and wherever you were accustomed
to frequent.  I have not heard whence the knowledge of your
movements came to her, nor have I been able to learn any data
whereon to found an opinion.  She seems to have heard both of your
marriage and your absence; but I gather, by inference, that she does
not actually know where you and Mimi are, or of your return.  So
soon as the dusk fails, she goes out on her rounds, and before dawn
covers the whole ground round the Brow, and away up into the heart
of the Peak.  The White Worm, in her own proper shape, certainly has
great facilities for the business on which she is now engaged.  She
can look into windows of any ordinary kind.  Happily, this house is
beyond her reach, if she wishes--as she manifestly does--to remain
unrecognised.  But, even at this height, it is wise to show no
lights, lest she might learn something of our presence or absence."
<P>
"Would it not be well, sir, if one of us could see this monster in
her real shape at close quarters?  I am willing to run the risk--for
I take it there would be no slight risk in the doing.  I don't
suppose anyone of our time has seen her close and lived to tell the
tale."
<P>
Sir Nathaniel held up an expostulatory hand.
<P>
"Good God, lad, what are you suggesting?  Think of your wife, and
all that is at stake."
<P>
"It is of Mimi that I think--for her sake that I am willing to risk
whatever is to be risked."
<P>
Adam's young bride was proud of her man, but she blanched at the
thought of the ghastly White Worm.  Adam saw this and at once
reassured her.
<P>
"So long as her ladyship does not know whereabout I am, I shall have
as much safety as remains to us; bear in mind, my darling, that we
cannot be too careful."
<P>
Sir Nathaniel realised that Adam was right; the White Worm had no
supernatural powers and could not harm them until she discovered
their hiding place.  It was agreed, therefore, that the two men
should go together.
<P>
When the two men slipped out by the back door of the house, they
walked cautiously along the avenue which trended towards the west.
Everything was pitch dark--so dark that at times they had to feel
their way by the palings and tree-trunks.  They could still see,
seemingly far in front of them and high up, the baleful light which
at the height and distance seemed like a faint line.  As they were
now on the level of the ground, the light seemed infinitely higher
than it had from the top of the tower.  At the sight Adam's heart
fell; the danger of the desperate enterprise which he had undertaken
burst upon him.  But this feeling was shortly followed by another
which restored him to himself--a fierce loathing, and a desire to
kill, such as he had never experienced before.
<P>
They went on for some distance on a level road, fairly wide, from
which the green light was visible.  Here Sir Nathaniel spoke softly,
placing his lips to Adam's ear for safety.
<P>
"We know nothing whatever of this creature's power of hearing or
smelling, though I presume that both are of no great strength.  As
to seeing, we may presume the opposite, but in any case we must try
to keep in the shade behind the tree-trunks.  The slightest error
would be fatal to us."
<P>
Adam only nodded, in case there should be any chance of the monster
seeing the movement.
<P>
After a time that seemed interminable, they emerged from the
circling wood.  It was like coming out into sunlight by comparison
with the misty blackness which had been around them.  There was
light enough to see by, though not sufficient to distinguish things
at a distance.  Adam's eyes sought the green light in the sky.  It
was still in about the same place, but its surroundings were more
visible.  It was now at the summit of what seemed to be a long white
pole, near the top of which were two pendant white masses, like
rudimentary arms or fins.  The green light, strangely enough, did
not seem lessened by the surrounding starlight, but had a clearer
effect and a deeper green.  Whilst they were carefully regarding
this--Adam with the aid of an opera-glass--their nostrils were
assailed by a horrid stench, something like that which rose from the
well-hole in Diana's Grove.
<P>
By degrees, as their eyes got the right focus, they saw an immense
towering mass that seemed snowy white.  It was tall and thin.  The
lower part was hidden by the trees which lay between, but they could
follow the tall white shaft and the duplicate green lights which
topped it.  As they looked there was a movement--the shaft seemed to
bend, and the line of green light descended amongst the trees.  They
could see the green light twinkle as it passed between the
obstructing branches.
<P>
Seeing where the head of the monster was, the two men ventured a
little further forward, and saw that the hidden mass at the base of
the shaft was composed of vast coils of the great serpent's body,
forming a base from which the upright mass rose.  As they looked,
this lower mass moved, the glistening folds catching the moonlight,
and they could see that the monster's progress was along the ground.
It was coming towards them at a swift pace, so they turned and ran,
taking care to make as little noise as possible, either by their
footfalls or by disturbing the undergrowth close to them.  They did
not stop or pause till they saw before them the high dark tower of
Doom.
