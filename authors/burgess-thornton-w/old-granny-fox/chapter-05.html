Yes, Sir, a chicken track is good to see, but<br/>
it often puts nothing but water in my mouth.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

</p>

<p>Reddy Fox thought of that saying many times as he hunted through
the Green Forest that night, afraid to go home. You see, he had
almost dined on Quacker the Duck over at the Big River that day
and then hadn't, and it was all his own fault. That was why he
was afraid to go home. From his hiding-place on the bank he had
watched Quacker swim in and in until he was almost on the shore
where old Granny Fox was whirling and rolling and tumbling about
as if she had entirely lost her senses. Indeed, Reddy had been
quite sure that she had when she began. It wasn't until he saw
that curiosity was drawing Quacker right in so that in a minute
or two Granny would be able to catch him, that he understood that
Granny was anything but crazy, and really was teaching him a new
trick as well as trying to catch a dinner.</p>

<p>When he realized this, he should have been ashamed of himself
for doubting the smartness of Granny and for thinking that he
knew all there was to know. But he was too much excited for any
such thoughts. Nearer and nearer to the shore came Quacker, his
eyes fixed on the red, whirling form of Granny. Reddy's own eyes
gleamed with excitement. Would Quacker keep on right up to the
shore? Nearer and nearer and nearer he came. Reddy squirmed uneasily.
He couldn't see as well as he wanted to. The bushes behind which
he was lying were in his way. He wanted to see Granny make that
jump which would mean a dinner for both.</p>

<p>Forgetting what Granny had charged him, Reddy eagerly raised
his head to look over the edge of the bank. Now it just happened
that at that very minute Quacker chanced to look that way. His
quick eyes caught the movement of Reddy's head and in an instant
all his curiosity vanished. That sharp face peering at him over
the edge of the bank could mean but one thing&mdash;danger! It was
all a trick! He saw through it now. Like a flash he turned. There
was the whistle of stiff wings beating the air and the patter
of feet striking the water as he got under way. Then he flew out
to the safety of the open water. Granny sprang, but she was just
too late and succeeded in doing no more than wet her feet.</p>

<p>Of course, Granny didn't know what had frightened Quacker, not
at first, anyway. But she had her suspicions. She turned and looked
up at the place where Reddy had been hiding. She couldn't see
him. Then she bounded up the bank. There was no Reddy there, but
far away across the snow-covered Green Meadows was a red spot
growing smaller and smaller. Reddy was running away. Then she
knew. At first Granny was very angry. You know it is a dreadful
thing to be hungry and have a good dinner disappear just as it
is almost within reach.</p>

<p>"I'll teach that young scamp a lesson he won't soon forget when
I get home," she muttered, as she watched him. Then she went back
to the edge of the Big River and there she found a dead fish which
had been washed ashore. It was a very good fish, and when she
had eaten it Granny felt better.</p>

<p>"Anyway," thought she, "I have taught him a new trick and one
he is n't likely to forget. He knows now that Granny still knows
a few tricks that he doesn't, and next time he won't feel so sure
he knows it all. I guess it was worth while even if I didn't catch
Quacker. My, but he would have tasted good!" Granny smacked her
lips and started for home.</p>

<p>But Reddy, with a guilty conscience, was afraid to go home. And
so, miserable and hungry, he hunted through the Green Forest all
the long night and wished and wished that he had heeded what old
Granny Fox had told him.</p>
