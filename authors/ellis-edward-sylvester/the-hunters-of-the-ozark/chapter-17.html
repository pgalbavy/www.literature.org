<p>By and by Fred Linden and Terry Clark became drowsy. Devoutly
kneeling, they spent several minutes in prayer, and then stretched
out on a single blanket, with their backs toward each other, and
the face of Fred in such a position that he could look across
the blaze at Deerfoot on the other side. The latter had remained
still and motionless, while the lads, remembering the lesson they
had learned at their mothers' knee, asked their Heavenly Father
to hold them in His keeping. The young Shawanoe, who spent many
an hour in communion with his Maker, was touched to see that his
friends did not forget their duty.</p>

<p>Deerfoot stirred the burning wood so that it threw out more light,
and then, reclining on his left elbow, so that the illumination
came directly in his face (the worst direction possible), he drew
from beneath his hunting-shirt the small Bible, that had been
presented to him by the Preston family, and began reading it.</p>

<p>Fred Linden, who had his eyes fixed upon him, was so interested
that his drowsiness departed. Without moving he watched him closely.
He saw him turning the leaves back and forth, as if looking for
some place he had in mind. It took him but a minute to find it,
when, still leaning on his elbow, and with the light striking
his face and the printed page, he seemed to become so absorbed
as to lose all consciousness of his surroundings.</p>

<p>Fred Linden, without betraying that he was awake, surveyed this
remarkable performance with an admiration that for the moment
made his eyes misty with emotion.</p>

<p>The eyes of Deerfoot were downcast, as he read the page, so that
they could not be seen but the handsome oval face; the luxuriant
black hair, with the eagle feathers thrust into the crown; the
rows of gleaming beads around the neck; the deerskin shirt that
covered the breast and arms to the wrists, on the left one of
which shone the golden bracelet; the red sash, behind which were
shoved the knife and tomahawk; the brilliant fringes of the hunting-shirt
and leggins; the small, ornamented moccasins; all these of themselves
made a striking figure; but Fred, handsome and rugged himself,
who was not accustomed to see any thing like beauty in the human
form, was struck with the symmetry of the figure before him. He
particularly noticed the tapering legs, and could not help saying
to himself:</p>

<p>"There is no Indian or white man that can run as fast as he."</p>

<p>And the mental declaration of the lad was truth. The fleetness
of the young warrior had never been equaled, and he had never
yet met the person whom he could not outrun with ease and without
putting forth his whole speed.</p>

<p>"He don't look strong, but he is the last person that I would
want to meet in a fight; I'll bet he is so quick that he could
dodge the bullet fired at him."</p>

<p>I must draw the line here: Deerfoot could not do any thing of
the kind.</p>

<p>"And he is reading his Bible! I never in all my life saw an Indian
who could read a word of print, or do more than sign his name
with a cross or some figure like a bug: I wonder whether we couldn't
hire him to teach school for us at Greville."</p>

<p>Fred thought a great many queer things about his new friend,
but lay watching him fully ten minutes before he spoke. Then,
when he saw him turn a leaf, he said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot, will you please read aloud?"</p>

<p>Fred expected that the Shawanoe would start and look up in surprise;
but he never raised his eyes, or gave the least sign that these
words of his were unexpected. He knew that Fred was watching him
from the first, and so, before the words were more than fairly
out of his mouth, Deerfoot began reading in a low, impressive
monotone, as though he had merely resumed, after turning over
the leaf.</p>

<p>"After this I beheld, and lo! a great multitude, which no man
could number, of all nations, and kindred, and people, and tongues,
stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white
robes, and palms in their hands;</p>

<p>"And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the
elders, and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their
faces and worshiped God.</p>

<p>"Singing, Amen; blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving
and honor and power and might be unto our God for ever and for
ever, Amen.</p>

<p>"And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, Who are these
which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?</p>

<p>"And I said unto him, sir, thou knowest. And he said unto me,
these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed
their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</p>

<p>"Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him day
and night in His temple; and He that sitteth on the throne shall
dwell among them.</p>

<p>"They shall hunger no more, neither shall they thirst any more;
neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.</p>

<p>"For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed
them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters; and
God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."</p>

<p>Deerfoot read a few minutes longer from his favorite part in
the New Testament and then ceased. He had not lifted his eyes
from the page, but he knew that Fred Linden was asleep. He observed
it in his breathing, which was as soft as that of an infant.</p>

<p>The rocky cavern, the smoldering camp-fire, the two sleeping
boys, the motionless Indian stretched out and reading his Bible
by the faint light, the great, solemn forest walling them in,
the profound stillness that reigned everywhere: these were elements
in a picture the like of which it may be said (except where Deerfoot
was one of the figures), had never been seen anywhere else, and
was not likely ever to be seen again.</p>

<p>The fire sank lower and the light on the printed page became
so dim that even the keen eyes of the young Shawanoe could not
trace the words. He looked at the embers as if asking himself
whether he should renew the blaze and continue reading. But the
hour for meditation had come, and he closed the book. Looking
fondly at the stiff, wooden cover, he touched his lips with infinite
tenderness to it, and carefully placed it in the inner receptacle
of his hunting-shirt, murmuring as he did so:</p>

<p>"The best friend that Deerfoot ever knew!"</p>

<p>O light of life! Comforter of the sorrowing heart! Consoler of
the stricken soul!</p>

<p>In the flush of bounding health, when the passions throb high,
we may not heed thy blessed teachings, but when man's promises
prove false, and the head bows before the endless strife, and
woes overwhelm us like a flood, there is relief, there is light,
there is life in Thee. The wicked may jeer, the learned may scoff,
the powerful may despise, the favored may turn away, but there
comes the time when learning, gifts, wealth, power, beauty and
all the world can give turn to ashes, and they have no boon compared
to Thine. "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."
The pampered monarch, the dying beggar, the statesman, the slave,
the mother bowed with woe, the father shaken with grief, childhood
in its innocence, man in his strength, beauty in its scorn, trembling
old age, can find no balm but in Thee. Better that the sun should
be blotted from the heavens and the earth left a trackless void
than that Thy light should be denied the world.</p>

<p>Deerfoot lay flat on his face, his arms crossed so that his head
and shoulders were held a few inches above the flinty floor, and
his dark eyes were fixed on the embers in front. It was his favorite
enjoyment, when the stirring incidents of the day were done, and
he had read from the only Book he ever wanted to read, to spend
a time in meditating on the truths that it may be said had become
a part of his very being.</p>

<p>Many a time had he lain thus, as motionless as if dead, while
the wonderful brain was busy with thoughts that stirred the profoundest
depths of his nature. There are beliefs that come to us at which
reason may laugh, but which it can not shake or disturb. There
are questions that the glib unbeliever may ask that we can not
answer. But away down in our hearts is a faith which the whole
world can not remove, and which can be uprooted only by ourselves.
Woe to him who dares lay violent hands upon it!</p>

<p>Deerfoot no more doubted that he and every one was in the direct
keeping of God than he doubted that he breathed and moved. He
knew that the Great Spirit had caused him to be made a prisoner
by whites so that he might learn the way of life; he knew that
He had given him an insight into the mysteries of His word that
was denied to many others. A deep, outstretching sympathy for
those less favored than he suffused his whole being. Gladly would
he have given up his life in pain and torture and agony, as did
One in the dim long ago, if by so doing he could earn the smile
of his Heavenly Father.</p>

<p>But this remarkable young Christian felt that he was doing the
work appointed for him to do. Here and there he dropped a word
that proved to be seed sown upon good ground, and which had borne
its fruit. He had met his enemies in fair combat and had never
taken wrong advantage of them: his marvelous bow and arrow, and
his still more effective rifle, had brought many a dusky miscreant
low, but he had used his amazing gifts in the line of duty, and
for the good of others. Would that he could have won them by love,
but it was not in the nature of things that he should do so. He
had "broken the Bread of Life" to more than one, and he hoped
that ere he should be called home, he should point the way to
others.</p>

<p>Suddenly he raised his chin from his hands and turned his head
slightly to one side. His ear, whose acuteness was almost beyond
belief, had caught a suspicious sound. Profound as might be the
meditation of the Shawanoe, he could never forget his surroundings.</p>
