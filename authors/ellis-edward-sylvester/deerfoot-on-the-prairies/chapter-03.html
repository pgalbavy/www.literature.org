<p><em>DEERFOOT </em>could be a stern master when necessary. While
it would have been no hardship for him and Mul-tal-la to divide
the duties of sentinel each night, he meant that the boys should
bear their part. They were big and strong enough to do so, and
there was no reason why they should not. He informed them that
George was to watch the camp for the first half of the night,
or rather for an hour beyond the turn, when he was to awake Victor,
who would take his place until daylight. This was to be the rule
throughout the expedition, except when some exigency demanded
the services of the elders.</p>

<p>Enough fuel had been gathered to last through the darkness. It
was Deerfoot’s plan to avoid the Indian villages so far as was
practical, although little or nothing was to be feared from meeting
those of his own race. The Blackfoot had come in contact with
many tribes on his long journey eastward, but excepting in two
instances nothing of an unpleasant nature occurred. You have learned
that the tribes which formed the confederacy crushed by "Mad Anthony"
Wayne at Fallen Timber were now so peaceably inclined toward the
white settlers that not much was to be feared from them.</p>

<p>And yet it was not wise to tempt them too far. An Indian loves
a horse, and among the tribes were plenty of thieves who would
run off the animals of our friends if the chance were offered.
So the latter did not mean to offer the chance.</p>

<p>The air was crisp, for the spring was only fairly open, and the
little company that gathered round the crackling blaze called
their blankets into use. The animals were allowed to crop the
grass near at hand, and to lie down when they chose. None was
tethered, for they were not likely to wander off, and if they
showed a disposition to do so the sentinel could easily prevent
it.</p>

<p>The four lolled about the blaze after finishing their evening
meal, talking mainly of the long journey and the experiences awaiting
them. Mul-tal-la answered Deerfoot’s questions again, for though
the Shawanoe was well informed, his inquiries were for the benefit
of the boys, whose interest naturally was keen.</p>

<p>When the night was well advanced, Deerfoot, without any preliminary,
drew his little Bible from his hunting shirt, and leaning forward
so that the light fell upon the small print, read the Twenty-third
Psalm, which, you remember, was one of his favorite chapters.
His voice was low, musical and reverent, and no professional elocutionist
could have given the sublime passage more impressively.</p>

<p>The three listened attentively, none speaking during the reading.
It seemed to George and Victor that they had never felt the beauty
and sweetness of the book whose utterances are sufficient for
every condition of man and every state of the human mind. The
surroundings, the great future which spread out so mysteriously
before them, the certain dangers that impended, their utter helplessness
and a sense of the all-protecting care of their Heavenly Father,
filled their souls as never before.</p>

<p>It would be hard to fathom the imaginings and thoughts of the
Blackfoot. He was sitting erect, with his blanket about his shoulders,
only a few paces from the young Shawanoe, and kept his eyes upon
the noble countenance as the precious words filled the stillness,
the listener fearful that some syllable might escape him. He had
learned much of the true God in his talks with the devout youth,
and, like him, had fallen into the habit of praying morning and
evening, and sometimes for a few moments in the busiest part of
the day.</p>

<p>The brothers recalled that loved parent who had been lying in
his grave for weeks, and remembered how he had prayed and how
triumphantly he had passed away when the last solemn moment arrived,
and both firmly resolved from that time forward so to live that
there could be no question of the reunion that to both was the
dearest, most joyous and thrilling hope that could possibly fill
their hearts.</p>

<p>While the two sat beside each other, silent and listening, George
gently reached out his hand. Victor saw the movement, and, taking
the palm within his own, fervently pressed it. At the same moment
the brothers looked into each other’s eyes. It was enough; volumes
could have said no more.</p>

<p>Deerfoot finished, and, closing the book, returned it to its
resting place over his heart. Then without a word he turned and
knelt on the cool earth. Instinctively the three did the same
and all prayed.</p>

<p>Not a word was heard, but heart spoke to heart, and all communed
with Him whose ear is never closed against the petition of his
children. Had either of the boys prayed aloud he would have stammered,
for he could not have shaken off the question as to how his words
impressed his companions. It is the impossibility in many cases
of one freeing himself from this hindrance that makes the sentences
of the petitioner halt and stumbling, because to a certain degree
they are addressed to men rather than directly to the Father.
The Blackfoot would have found it almost impossible to shape intelligently
his sentences if he spoke aloud, but he could talk freely in his
own way to his Maker. Deerfoot could have done far better than
any of the others, for he would not have hesitated, but he preferred
the silent petition, and rarely spoke his words unless he was
asked to do so or a special necessity existed.</p>

<p>The others took their cue from him, and when they heard the gentle
rustling which showed that he had resumed his sitting posture
they did the same. Then he nodded to George, who, rifle in hand,
walked softly out in the gloom to where the animals had lain down
for the night, in the midst of the grass and near the rippling
brook. As he did so he bade his friends good night, and they disposed
of themselves in the usual way, each with his blanket wrapped
about him and his feet turned toward the fire. Within ten minutes
every one of the three was sunk in sweet, refreshing slumber.</p>

<p>The night was clear and studded with stars. There was no moon,
the gloom being so deep that the watcher could see only a few
paces in any direction. Often as he had spent the night in the
dim solitudes, sometimes with danger brooding and again when all
was tranquil, he could never cast off the emotions that filled
his being when he stood thus alone, with friends dependent perhaps
upon his vigilance. He listened to the soft rippling of the brook,
the hollow stillness of the vast forest, like the moaning of the
far-away ocean which has been called the voice of silence, the
occasional restless movement of one of the horses, and the gentle
stir of the night wind among the bursting foliage overhead and
around him. Then he looked toward the fire at the dimly outlined
forms, partly within and partly without the circle of illumination,
and again his heart was lifted to the only One who could ward
off danger from him and his friends.</p>

<p>The youth marked out a beat for himself parallel with the brook
and two or three rods in length. Sometimes he paused and, leaning
on his gun, peered into the hollow gloom which inclosed him on
every hand. He knew that so long as he kept on his feet he would
not fall asleep, but if he sat down the lapse was inevitable.
Better still to walk to and fro, as is the practice of the sentinel,
for while doing so he was safe against the insidious weakness
which steals the senses from the most rugged man ere he is aware.</p>

<p>George did not believe that any danger threatened the camp unless
of the nature hinted by Deerfoot. It might be that some wandering
Miamis or Wyandots or Shawanoes had observed the little party
and their horses and cast covetous eyes upon the latter. If so,
they would not dare to proceed to violence, but might try to run
off one or two of the animals, hoping to get far enough away with
them before discovery of the theft to make pursuit useless. It
was this apprehension which kept the youth alert and watchful.</p>

<p>George Shelton had paced to and fro for more than an hour without
hearing or seeing anything to excite misgiving. The cry of a wolf
in the distance and the nearer scream of a panther were given
scarcely a thought, for both were too common to cause alarm.</p>

<p>The first disturbance came from the action of his horse Jack,
who had lain down at a point farther off than the others. All
the animals seemed to be resting quietly, when, at the moment
the lad was nearest his own and was about to turn to retrace his
steps, Jack raised his head and emitted a slight whinny, though
none of the others showed any disquiet.</p>

<p>The sentinel paused and looked at his pony, dimly outlined in
the darkness. He saw he had raised his head and appeared to be
interested in something on the other side of the brook. George
lifted the hammer of his rifle, suspecting that some prowling
wolf or other wild beast was trying to creep nigh enough to assail
the horses. The youth peered into the gloom and listened, but
all remained as silent as the grave.</p>

<p>He held his motionless position for several minutes, in doubt
what he ought to do, if indeed he could do anything. Then with
rare courage he began slowly walking toward the point in which
Jack seemed interested, holding his gun ready to raise and fire
on the instant.</p>

<p>He reached the brook and was about to leap lightly across when
the figure of an Indian rose from the grass and stood revealed
hardly ten feet distant. He did not move, and seemed to have come
up from a hole in the earth. The sight was so startling to the
lad that he stopped abruptly and exclaimed in a low tone:</p>

<p>"Helloa! Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Howdy, brudder?" replied the redskin in the same guarded voice.</p>

<p>"What do you want, stealing into our camp like this!"</p>

<p>"Me Par-o-wan—friend of paleface—me brudder."</p>

<p>"You haven’t told me what you want," repeated the impatient youth,
with his gun half raised, for he was suspicious, and saw that
the other held a rifle almost in the same position as his own.</p>

<p>"Par-o-wan brudder; sit down—talk wid brudder—lub brudder."</p>

<p>"Dog of a Miami! leave at once! You have others with you! If
you tarry we shall shoot every one of you!"</p>

<p>It was not George Shelton who uttered this warning, but Deerfoot,
who appeared at his side so suddenly and noiselessly that the
lad had no thought of anything of the kind until he heard the
familiar voice.</p>

<p>"Par-o-wan friend ob Deerfoot—he no hunt him—he go away," replied
the Miami, plainly scared by the words and manner of the young
Shawanoe, who now raised his rifle to a "dead level" and acted
as if he meant to fire.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot knows you and those that are with you, Par-o-wan! You
are the thieves who have come to steal our horses. Go quick or
I shoot!"</p>

<p>In a panic of fear the Miami wheeled and dashed off so fast that
he threshed through the undergrowth and wood like a frightened
wild animal. Deerfoot waited a minute in the same vigilant attitude,
and then quietly remarked:</p>

<p>"They will trouble us no more. Now Deerfoot will sleep."</p>

<p>"But tell me what woke you; I didn’t give any alarm," said the
mystified George Shelton.</p>

<p>"My brother spoke. Deerfoot heard his voice. My brother is watchful,
but he will not be troubled again by the Miamis, for they are
alarmed."</p>

<p>And without anything further the Shawanoe walked silently back
to his place by the camp-fire, drew his blanket around him and
five minutes later was sleeping as peacefully as before he was
awakened by the soft voices of the man and boy.</p>

<p>"Well, that beats all creation!" muttered the grinning lad, as
he resumed his pacing to and fro. "We didn’t make enough noise
to wake a sleeping baby, but he must have been roused by the first
word, for he was at my side in a few seconds. I don’t see the
need of putting one of us on guard when Deerfoot wakes up like
that. He’s a wonder and no mistake."</p>

<p>So full was George’s faith in the young Shawanoe that he was
absolutely sure nothing more was to be feared from the Miamis
who had evidently stolen up to the camp with the intention of
running off one or more of the horses. He paced regularly over
his beat until certain it was well past midnight, when he went
up to the fire, threw more wood on it and touched the arm of his
brother.</p>

<p>You know that when you sink into slumber with the wish strongly
impressed on your mind of awaking at a certain minute, you are
almost sure to do so, or at least very near the time stamped on
your brain. While George Shelton was in the act of stooping to
rouse Victor the latter opened his eyes and rose to the sitting
posture.</p>

<p>"I’m ready," he said softly, coming to his feet, gun in hand.
"Have you seen anything, George?"</p>

<p>The latter quickly whispered the particulars of the little incident
already told.</p>

<p>"Well, if Deerfoot said they won’t be back, they won’t be back;
but I mean to keep a lookout for them."</p>

<p>With which philosophical decision Victor strolled out to the
beat whose location his brother had made known to him. While gathering
the blanket about him to lie down George glanced at Deerfoot,
who lay within arm’s length. At that moment one of the embers
at the base of the fire fell apart and the flare of light fell
upon the face of the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>George saw that his large dark eyes were open, and no doubt he
had heard every word of the cautious bit of conversation between
the brothers. He did not speak, however, and immediately closed
his eyes again, no doubt dropping off to sleep as quietly as before.
It was a considerable time before George slumbered, for the experience
of the evening, even though it amounted to little, touched his
nerves. Finally he glided off into the land of dreams.</p>

<p>Victor did his duty faithfully, as his brother had done, and
with his senses keyed to a high tension, but not the slightest
disturbance occurred. Deerfoot was right in his declaration. If
Par-o-wan had companions they had been too thoroughly frightened
to risk rousing the anger of the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>The latter acted as provider again and furnished his friends
with another meal upon wild turkey, promising to vary the diet
in the course of a day or two, though no one felt like complaining,
since there was an abundance for all, and such meat is not to
be despised, even though one can become tired of it.</p>

<p>Thus early in their venture our friends met with a disagreeable
experience, for though the day dawned with the sun visible, the
temperature fell and a cold, drizzling rain set in, which promised
to last for hours. Deerfoot read the signs aright, and before
the rainfall began conducted his companions to a rocky section
a little way off the trail, where they found shelter for themselves
and partial protection for their horses. Had there been an Indian
village within easy distance they would have made their way thither,
being sure of a welcome.</p>

<p>It was not the cheerless day itself that was so trying, for that
was much improved by the fire they kept going, but it was the
enforced inaction. Few things are harder to bear than idleness
when one is anxious to get forward. The boys fretted, but Deerfoot
and Mul-tal-la accepted the situation philosophically, as they
always accepted the bad with the good. No murmur would have been
heard from either had they been halted for several days. Deerfoot,
indeed, had reached that wise state of mind in which his conscience
reproved him for complaining of anything, since he knew it was
ordered by One who doeth all things well.</p>
