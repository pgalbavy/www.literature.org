<p><em>THE CAPTAIN’S </em>presentiments were verified. The suspicions
of his lieutenant had been aroused by his unusual manner, nor
had they been allayed by the explanation he gave of his intended
journey. Immediately after the captain’s departure he had convened
the members of the band, and harangued them thus.</p>

<p>"Boys, I have something to say to you that affects our common
interests. The captain has left us for a visit to the city, and
he has explained his reasons for going. He will try to negotiate
the bonds taken from one of our late prisoners. Very likely he
has told us the truth. He will doubtless get what he can for them,
but <em>will he come back</em>?"</p>

<p>At this significant question the robbers started, and their faces
looked dark and threatening.</p>

<p>"What makes you think he won’t, lieutenant?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Human nature," replied Alonzo. "If he gets a good round sum,
say ten or twenty thousand dollars, he will be tempted to keep
it all himself, and leave us to our fate. Who shall say there
is no danger? What should hinder his taking the next steamer for
New York?"</p>

<p>Alonzo saw by the fierce looks of his adherents that his suggestion
had produced its effect. He continued:</p>

<p>"I noticed, just before the captain’s departure, that he acted
strangely; he took walks by himself, and evidently had some plan
in view. I noticed also that he had a confidential talk with the
boy, Tom. What does all this mean?"</p>

<p>"But the bonds didn’t belong to the boy."</p>

<p>"No, but there were other matters in which he might wish to obtain
information from the boy. Again, this boy was on his way to the
mines. After his talk with the captain, he changed his plans and
returned to the city. Shall I tell you what I think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"I think, then, that the boy and he were old acquaintances, that
he brought the captain a message from outside, and that this and
the bonds decided him to abandon us."</p>

<p>"Let us pursue him! Let us kill him!" exclaimed the exasperated
robbers.</p>

<p>"Hold! not so fast. Let him be followed, but by one only. Remember,
he may be innocent. He may mean to deal fairly and squarely with
us. If so, let him still remain our honored chief. But if he means
to play us false"—here the speaker’s face grew stern—"let him
die the death of a traitor."</p>

<p>"How shall we find out?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Appoint me to follow and watch him. I will go in disguise. I
will see for myself what he does. I will dog his steps, and if
it be true that he would desert us, I will be your avenger. Shall
it be so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, let Alonzo go!" was the unanimous shout.</p>

<p>"Be it so. Boys, I go as your messenger. I go into danger, but
I go to serve your interests. Whoever may be found wanting, you
shall never find me a traitor."</p>

<p>He finished his harangue, and an hour later he was on his way
to San Francisco, which he reached nearly as soon as the captain.</p>

<p>He met his superior in command for the first time on the occasion
mentioned in the last chapter. He penetrated his disguise at once,
assisted thereto by his companion’s presence. As we know, the
captain was not so fortunate, and in the bowed and decrepit beggar
who implored alms, he failed to recognize his subordinate—the
man whom he had the greatest cause to fear—nor did he observe
that the beggar followed him. Had he done so, his suspicions would
hardly have been aroused.</p>

<p>After the captain left Tom, he made his way to the office of
the steamship company. Alonzo’s keen eyes lighted up when he saw
his destination. Now his suspicions were verified.</p>

<p>"It is as I thought," he said to himself. "The captain has betrayed
us. Arrived in New York, he may make his peace with the authorities
and renounce his old comrades, and bring us to capture and death.
He shall never do it! He shall never live to do it!"</p>

<p>As we know, he did the captain wrong in this suspicion. Though
he fully intended to forsake the band and hoped never to meet
any member of it again, it never once occurred to him to denounce
them. There is honor among thieves—so the proverb has it—and he
would have shrunk from such a betrayal.</p>

<p>The captain went back to his place of temporary sojourn. Now
that his object was so far accomplished, and ticket secured for
New York, he deemed it discreet to keep himself as much out of
the way as possible till the time came for going on board the
steamer.</p>

<p>Every evening Tom came to see him. He handed our hero his ticket,
and the evening before sailing he handed Tom the belt containing
the papers and securities, much to our hero’s amazement. The captain
read his wonder in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You are surprised that I give you them so soon," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom. "Of course I am glad to have them in charge,
but I did not suppose you would trust me with them."</p>

<p>"I will tell you why," said the robber-chief. "I have a presentiment
of evil. I feel that some one of my old comrades is on my track.
Should evil befall me, I do not want the bonds to fall into their
hands. I prefer, if they cannot benefit me, that they should go
to you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tom, "but I heartily hope that you are mistaken—that
you will leave this city in safety, and far away have a chance
to redeem your past life."</p>

<p>"I think you are sincere," said the captain, taking his hand.
"I trust you more than any other living being. For that reason,
whatever comes to me, I wish that you may prosper."</p>

<p>The day of sailing came. Tom and the captain went on board the
steamer. As they stood by the railing and looked over the side,
Tom said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Where are your presentiments now? Nothing has happened."</p>

<p>The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is not too late yet," he said.</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished the sentence than a report was heard.
The captain pressed his hand convulsively to his breast and dropped
upon the deck. He never uttered another word. When he was taken
up he was dead.</p>

<p>Tom looked about him in horror, expecting to see the assassin.
But there was no one who looked likely to commit the deed. No
one thought of suspecting a decrepit and infirm old beggar, who
tottered slowly away from the wharf with head bowed down.</p>

<p>"The traitor is punished! We are avenged!" he muttered. "Now
I am the captain!"</p>

<p>But Alonzo’s triumph was premature. He had been seen in the act
of firing the pistol. He was arrested, and identified as a member
of the famous band that had been the scourge of the interior.
He was tried, convicted and executed within the space of one month.
So the captain was revenged, and the band, now without a head,
was speedily disbanded.</p>
