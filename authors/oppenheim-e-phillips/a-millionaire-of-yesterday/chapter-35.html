Da Souza's office was neither furnished nor located with the idea
of impressing casual visitors.  It was in a back-street off an
alley, and although within a stone's throw of Lothbury its immediate
surroundings were not exhilarating.  A blank wall faced it, a
green-grocer's shop shared with a wonderful, cellar-like public-house
the honour of its more immediate environment.  Trent, whose first
visit it was, looked about him with surprise mingled with some
disgust.
<P>
He pushed open the swing door and found himself face to face with
Da Souza's one clerk - a youth of unkempt appearance, shabbily but
flashily dressed, with sallow complexion and eyes set close together.
He was engaged at that particular moment in polishing a large
diamond pin upon the sleeve of his coat, which operation he suspended
to gaze with much astonishment at this unlocked-for visitor.  Trent
had come straight from Ascot, straight indeed from his interview
with Francis, and was still wearing his racing-glasses.
<P>
"I wish to see Mr. Da Souza," Trent said.  "Is he in?"
<P>
"I believe so, sir," the boy answered.  "What name?"
<P>
"Trent!  Mr. Scarlett Trent!"
<P>
The door of an inner office opened, and Da Souza, sleek and curled,
presented himself.  He showed all his white teeth in the smile
with which he welcomed his visitor.  The light of battle was in his
small, keen eyes, in his cringing bow, his mock humility.
<P>
"I am most honoured, Mr. Trent, sir," he declared.  "Welcome back
to England.  When did you return?"
<P>
"Yesterday," Trent said shortly.
<P>
"And you have come," Da Souza continued, "fresh from the triumphs
of the race-course.  It is so, I trust?"
<P>
"I have come straight from Ascot," Trent replied, "but my horse was
beaten if that is what you mean.  I did not come here to talk about
racing though.  I want a word with you in private."
<P>
"With much pleasure, sir," Da Souza answered, throwing open with a
little flourish the door of his sanctum.  "Will you step in?  This
way!  The chair is dusty.  Permit me!"
<P>
Trent threw a swift glance around the room in which he found himself.
It was barely furnished, and a window, thick with dust, looked out
on the dingy back-wall of a bank or some public building.  The floor
was uncovered, the walls were hung with yellow maps of gold-mines all
in the West African district.  Da Souza himself, spick and span, with
glossy boots and a flower in his buttonhole, was certainly the least
shabby thing in the room.
<P>
"You know very well," Trent said, "what I have come about.  Of course
you'll pretend you don't, so to save time I'll tell you.  What have
you done with Monty?"
<P>
Da Souza spread outwards the palms of his hands.  He spoke with
well-affected impatience.
<P>
"Monty!  always Monty!  What do I want with him?  It is you who
should look after him, not I."
<P>
Trent turned quietly round and locked the door.  Da Souza would have
called out, but a paroxysm of fear had seized him.  His fat, white
face was pallid, and his knees were shaking.  Trent's hand fell upon
his shoulder, and Da Souza felt as though the claws of a trap had
gripped him.
<P>
"If you call out I'll throttle you," Trent said.  "Now listen.
Francis is in England and, unless Monty is produced, will tell the
whole story.  I shall do the best I can for all of us, but I'm not
going to have Monty done to death.  Come, let's have the truth."
<P>
Da Souza was grey now with a fear greater even than a physical one.
He had been so near wealth.  Was he to lose everything?
<P>
"Mr. Trent," he whispered, "my dear friend, have reason.  Monty, I
tell you, is only half alive, he hangs on, but it is a mere thread
of life.  Leave it all to me!  To-morrow he shall be dead! - oh,
quite naturally.  There shall be no risk!  Trent, Trent!"
<P>
His cry ended in a gurgle, for Trent's hand was on his throat.
<P>
"Listen, you miserable hound," he whispered.  "Take me to him this
moment, or I'll shake the life out of you.  Did you ever know me
go back from my word?"
<P>
Da Souza took up his hat with an ugly oath and yielded.  The two
men left the office together.
<P>
     *           *           *           *           *
<P>
"Listen!"
<P>
The two women sat in silence, waiting for some repetition of the
sound.  This time there was certainly no possibility of any mistake.
&gt;From the room above their heads came the feeble, quavering sobbing
of an old man.  Julie threw down her book and sprang up.
<P>
"Mother, I cannot bear it any longer," she cried.  "I know where
the key is, and I am going into that room"
<P>
Mrs. Da Souza's portly frame quivered with excitement.
<P>
"My child," she pleaded, "don't Julie, do remember!  Your father
will know, and then - oh, I shall be frightened to death!"
<P>
"It is nothing to do with you, mother," the girl said, "I am going."
<P>
Mrs. Da Souza produced a capacious pocket-handkerchief, reeking with
scent, and dabbed her eyes with it.  From the days when she too had
been like Julie, slim and pretty, she had been every hour in dread
of her husband.  Long ago her spirit had been broken and her
independence subdued.  To her friend and confidants no word save of
pride and love for her husband had ever passed her lips, yet now as
she watched her daughter she was conscious of a wild, passionate
wish that her fate at least might be a different one.  And while
she mopped her eyes and looked backward, Julie disappeared.
<P>
Even Julie, as she ascended the stairs with the key of the locked
room in her hand, was conscious of unusual tremors.  If her position
with regard to her father was not the absolute condition of serfdom
into which her mother had been ground down, she was at least afraid
of him, and she remembered the strict commands he had laid upon them
all.  The room was not to be open save by himself.  All cries and
entreaties were to be disregarded, every one was to behave as though
that room did not exist.  They had borne it already for days, the
heart-stirring moans, the faint, despairing cries of the prisoner,
and she could bear it no longer.  She had a tender little heart, and
from the first it had been moved by the appearance of the pitiful
old man, leaning so heavily upon her father's arm, as they had come
up the garden walk together.  She made up her mind to satisfy
herself at least that his isolation was of his own choice.  So she
went boldly up the stairs and thrust the key into the lock.  A
moment's hesitation, then she threw it open.
<P>
Her first impulse, when she had looked into the face of the man who
stumbled up in fear at her entrance, was to then and there abandon
her enterprise - for Monty just then was not a pleasant sight to
look upon.  The room was foul with the odour of spirits and tobacco
smoke.  Monty himself was unkempt and unwashed, his eyes were
bloodshot, and he had fallen half across the table with the gesture
of a drunken man.  At the sight of him her pity died away.  After
all, then, the sobbing they had heard was the maudlin crying of a
drunken man.  Yet he was very old, and there was something about
the childish, breathless fear with which he was regarding her which
made her hesitate.  She lingered instead, and finding him
tongue-tied, spoke to him.
<P>
"We heard you talking to yourself downstairs," she said, "and we
were afraid that you might be in pain."
<P>
"Ah," he muttered, "That is all, then!  There is no one behind you
 - no one who wants me!"
<P>
"There is no one in the house," she assured him, "save my mother
and myself."
<P>
He drew a little breath which ended in a sob.  "You see," he said
vaguely, "I sit up here hour by hour, and I think that I fancy
things.  Only a little while ago I fancied that I heard Mr. Walsh's
voice, and he wanted the mission-box, the wooden box with the cross,
you know.  I keep on thinking I hear him.  Stupid, isn't it?"
<P>
He smiled weakly, and his bony fingers stole round the tumbler
which stood by his side.  She shook her head at him smiling, and
crossed over to him.  She was not afraid any more.
<P>
"I wouldn't drink if I were you," she said, "it can't be good for
you, I'm sure!"
<P>
"Good," he answered slowly, "it's poison - rank poison."
<P>
"If I were you," she said, "I would put all this stuff away and go
for a nice walk.  It would do you much more good."
<P>
He shook his head.
<P>
"I daren't," he whispered.  "They're looking for me now.  I must
hide - hide all the time!"
<P>
"Who are looking for you?" she asked.
<P>
"Don't you know?  Mr. Walsh and his wife!  They have come over
after me!"
<P>
"Why?"
<P>
"Didn't you know," he muttered," that I am a thief?"
<P>
She shook her head.
<P>
"No, I certainly didn't.  I'm very sorry!"
<P>
He nodded his head vigorously a great many times.
<P>
"Won't you tell me about it?" she asked.  "Was it anything very bad?"
<P>
"I don't know," he said.  "It's so hard to remember!  It is
something like this!  I seem to have lived for such a long time, and
when I look back I can remember things that happened a very long
time ago, but then there seems a gap, and everything is all misty,
and it makes my head ache dreadfully to try and remember," he moaned.
<P>
"Then don't try," she said kindly.  "I'll read to you for a little
time if you like, and you shall sit quite quiet."
<P>
He seemed not to have heard her.  He continued presently - 
<P>
"Once before I died, it was all I wanted.  Just to have heard her
speak, to have seen my little girl grown into a woman, and the sea
was always there, and Oom Sam would always come with that cursed
rum.  Then one day came Trent and talked of money and spoke of
England, and when he went away it rang for ever in my ears, and at
night I heard her calling for me across the sea.  So I stole out,
and the great steamer was lying there with red fires at her funnel,
and I was mad.  She was crying for me across the sea, so I took
the money!"
<P>
She patted his hand gently.  There was a lump in her throat, and
her eyes were wet.
<P>
"Was it your daughter you wanted so much to see?" she asked softly.
<P>
"My daughter!  My little girl," he answered!  "And I heard her
calling to me with her mother's voice across the sea.  So I took
the money."
<P>
"No one would blame you very much for that, I am sure," she said
cheerfully.  "You are frightening yourself needlessly.  I will
speak to Father, and he shall help you."
<P>
He held up his hand.
<P>
"He is hiding me," he whispered.  "It is through him I knew that
they were after me.  I don't mind for myself, but she might get
to know, and I have brought disgrace enough upon her.  Listen!"
<P>
There were footsteps upon the stairs.  He clung to her in an agony
of terror.
<P>
"They are coming!" he cried.  "Hide me!  Oh, hide me!"
<P>
But she too was almost equally terrified, for she had recognised
her father's tread.  The door was thrown open and De Souza entered,
followed by Scarlett Trent.
