<p>It may be said that Monteith Sterry's main hope for the success
of his perilous scheme lay in its boldness.</p>

<p>It was not to be supposed that the rustlers, surrounding the
besieged on every hand, would forget the probability of just such
an attempt as he made. The stockmen could not expect to slip away
one by one, or in a body; nor was there anything to tempt such
an effort, even if it offered a fair prospect of success; for,
of necessity, they would have to depart on foot, and with the
coming of daylight their situation would be worse than now, with
a strong shelter above and around them.</p>

<p>But it was known among the defenders that two of their number
were doomed, if they fell into the hands of the rustlers. It was
probable, therefore, that one or both of these individuals would
try to get away.</p>

<p>Whether or not the leaders held any distrust of Vesey cannot
be known; but his little scheme for befriending Monteith Sterry
was nipped in the bud by his being retained at the front of the
building, where, as has been shown, he acted as the bearer of
messages between Inman and Capt. Asbury.</p>

<p>There were men closely watching the building from the moment
darkness closed over the scene. Had Sterry attempted to steal
along the side of the house and then dodge away, he would have
been detected and halted at once. On the contrary, he moved with
his usual gait in a diagonal direction toward the stables. His
object was to learn the likeliest method of leaving the place.</p>

<p>He had perhaps walked fifty feet, when some one advanced from
the gloom and called, in an undertone:</p>

<p>"Halloo, who is that?"</p>

<p>"It's I, Smith; who are you?"</p>

<p>The name, of course, was a venture, but it was not uncommon,
as the reader knows, and more likely to be right than any other.
The best of it was, it seemed to satisfy the other, who, without
announcing his own, asked:</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"I've been looking around to see what I could learn."</p>

<p>"Anything new?"</p>

<p>"No, not as far as I can discover; they seem to have a light
burning in there, but are waiting for us."</p>

<p>"I wonder they didn't give you a shot; Vesey says they are desperate,
and he brought back word that they would shoot the first of us
seen prowling about the place. I wonder you didn't catch it."</p>

<p>"I took good care. When do you suppose the fight will open?"</p>

<p>"Pretty soon; I s'pose you are as tired of this dallying as the
rest of us."</p>

<p>"Well, it strikes me as best to wait until sure everything is
ready."</p>

<p>Sterry was anxious to end this pointless conversation, for the
stranger had approached quite near and peered into his face, as
though not free from suspicion. The darkness was deep, but on
the other side of the ridge a small fire was burning, from fragments
brought from the stables. Of this the adventurer meant to keep
clear at all hazards. More than one rustler knew him intimately,
and it might be that he to whom he was talking was an old acquaintance
and enemy.</p>

<p>How Sterry longed for the presence of Vesey!</p>

<p>In a natural manner he sauntered up the ridge, as if his intention
was to return to the camp-fire, that being the course most likely
to dissipate any misgiving on the part of the other.</p>

<p>The latter made no response, and Sterry kept on, thinking:</p>

<p>"I'm rid of him, any way, and ought to have less trouble with
others that may wish to ask questions."</p>

<p>But, glancing over his shoulder, he was startled to observe that
the man, instead of moving off, as he had supposed, was standing
motionless in the gloom, as if studying him.</p>

<p>"By gracious!" concluded the youth, "he must have noticed my
voice, for, not knowing Smith, how could I imitate it?"</p>

<p>The situation would have made any one uneasy, but he did not
hasten nor retard his footsteps until he reached the top of the
ridge, and was able to observe the camp-fire clearly.</p>

<p>It was small, as has been said, but five or six figures were
lolling about it, smoking, talking, and passing the dismal hours
as inclination prompted. Other forms were moving hither and thither,
some of them quite close to where Sterry had halted, though none
paid him any attention.</p>

<p>The young man was looking for an opening by which he could make
his way beyond the lines without attracting attention. The best
prospect seemed to be the stretch of prairie extending from the
front of the house toward the Big Horn Mountains.</p>

<p>"No one appears to be on the lookout there&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant each arm was tightly gripped, and the man with
whom he had exchanged words but a few minutes before said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith, please go with us to the fire; my friend here is
Smith, and he is the only one in our party with that name; maybe
you are his double."</p>

<p>It was useless to resist, and Sterry replied:</p>

<p>"You know there are several Smiths in this country, and I ought
to have the privilege of wearing the name without objection."</p>

<p>"We'll soon see," replied the first captor.</p>

<p>Within the next minute Sterry was marched in front of the camp-fire,
where the full glare fell upon his countenance.</p>

<p>Then a howl of exultation went up, for more than half of the
rustlers in the group recognized him.</p>
