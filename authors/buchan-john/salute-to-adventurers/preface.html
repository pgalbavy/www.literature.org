<p>TO <em>MAJOR-GENERAL THE HON. SIR REGINALD TALBOT, K.C.B</em>.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
I tell of old Virginian ways;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And who more fit my tale to scan<br/>
Than you, who knew in far-off days<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The eager horse of Sheridan;<br/>
Who saw the sullen meads of fate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tattered scrub, the blood-drenched sod,<br/>
Where Lee, the greatest of the great,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent to the storm of God?

</p>
<p>
I tell lost tales of savage wars;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you have known the desert sands,<br/>
The camp beneath the silver stars,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rush at dawn of Arab bands,<br/>
The fruitless toil, the hopeless dream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fainting feet, the faltering breath,<br/>
While Gordon by the ancient stream<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited at ease on death.

</p>
<p>
And now, aloof from camp and field,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You spend your sunny autumn hours<br/>
Where the green folds of Chiltern shield<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The nooks of Thames amid the flowers:<br/>
You who have borne that name of pride,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In honour clean from fear or stain,<br/>
Which Talbot won by Henry's side<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In vanquished Aquitaine.

in this tale and many of the incidents have good historical warrant.
The figure of Muckle John Gib will be familiar to the readers
