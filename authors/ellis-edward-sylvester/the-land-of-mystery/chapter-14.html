<p>Fred Ashman was standing near the edge of the Xingu, as will
be remembered, when his attention was diverted for the moment
by a puma, which came out of the wood, drank from the stream,
and then, after a brief pause, returned to his shelter.</p>

<p>All this while, the dull roar of the rapids was in the explorer's
ears, and he was eager to withdraw his attention from the beast
and direct it upon the opposite shore, where he was convinced
something unusual was going on.</p>

<p>The minute the beast disappeared, he looked across at the point
that had so interested him.</p>

<p>The question which he had asked himself some time before, was
answered by the sight of a small canoe that was stealing down
the river, instead of heading directly across to where he was
standing.  In this boat was a single individual, using a paddle
with the deftness of an American Indian.</p>

<p>Here was something that needed attention, and, with the aid of
the brilliant moonlight.  Ashman watched the craft and its occupant
as closely as if his own fate were wrapped up in its movements&mdash;a
supposition which it was not improbable was fact itself.</p>

<p>The savage moved slowly, as if sensible of the call for the utmost
care, went only a few rods down stream, when he turned out in
the water and aimed for the shore where the watcher was standing. 
He had gone some distance below, and it was to be supposed that
the force of the current would carry him still farther, so that
if he made a landing it was likely to be far below.</p>

<p>But he who held the paddle was a master of that species of navigation,
and Ashman was surprised to observe that he was aiming at the
very spot where he was standing carefully concealed in the shadow. 
If nothing interfered, they were sure of making a closer acquaintance.</p>

<p>The boat was about the middle of the river, when the white man
was struck by the immense size of the occupant.  He was one of
the largest men he had ever seen, his weight sinking the canoe
almost to its gunwales.</p>

<p>"He must be the savage who hurled his javelin through our boat,"
was the conclusion of the astonished Fred.  "What a magnificent
fellow he is!"</p>

<p>The native sat so that his face was turned toward the young man,
who studied his countenance with the deepest interest.</p>

<p>He had the busy head, the large protruding eyes, and the dark,
naked skin of all his people.  His enormous arms swung the paddle
first on one side of the boat and then on the other.  As he did
so, Fred saw the play of the splendid muscle, which was like that
of Hercules himself. Rash would be that antagonist who engaged
him in a hand-to-hand struggle.</p>

<p>Nothing in the world was easier than for the explorer to extinguish
the life in that impressive specimen of physical manhood, without
the least risk to himself, and yet, although he knew him to be
the most formidable enemy of his people, he held no thought of
doing him harm&mdash;at least not at the present stage of his extraordinary
business.</p>

<p>It was at this decidedly interesting juncture that a new element
obtruded itself.  The sounds of guns, shouts and yells, in the
direction of the rapids left no doubt that his friends there were
having a lively time with the natives.</p>

<p>Ashman would have turned and made all haste thither, but for
the presence of this burly giant in front.  Whatever was going
on down stream was with the full knowledge of him, and he was
the one for the white man to look after.</p>

<p>Had the latter been surprised by the sounds of conflict, he would
have ceased paddling or headed his boat up stream, but he merely
glanced toward the rapids, and continued dipping his paddle and
propelling his craft, as if it was his intention to step ashore
and grasp the hand of the astonished youth awaiting his arrival.</p>

<p>The passage occupied but a very few minutes.  Just before the
bank was reached, he made one powerful sweep of the oar, which
sent the prow far up the shingle, and then leaped as lightly as
a cat from the structure, which bounded up as if relieved of several
hundred pounds' weight.</p>

<p>Turning about, the giant stooped down and took a spear as long
and heavy as the one he had hurled nearly across the Xingu, through
the boat of the explorers.</p>

<p>It seemed that there was to be no end to the obtrusion of "side
issues" upon the little drama going on under Fred Ashman's eyes. 
It must have been that the puma which had slaked its thirst at
the Xingu's margin a short time before, had become convinced that
parties were near, entitled to his attention.</p>

<p>While endeavoring to locate him, he probably caught sight of
the approaching native and concluded that he was the individual
to whom he should turn.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the native had only time to pick up his ponderous
spear and face toward the wood, when the lion emerged from the
broadening band of shadow, and, with a low, threatening growl,
advanced upon him.</p>

<p>Like the cat species to which he belonged, he crouched so low
while walking, that his shoulders protruded above his back in
large humps, and his belly almost touched the ground.  His long
tail flirted angrily from side to side, his jaws were parted,
disclosing his sharp, carnivorous teeth and blood-red tongue,
while his eyes emitted a phosphorescent glow that was like fire
itself.</p>

<p>He was a formidable antagonist, and as Ashman observed his movements
and ugly appearance, he felt like pumping a half dozen bullets
into his lank, muscular body.</p>

<p>But he experienced the natural interest of a sportsman in an
impending fight, and was curious to see how the huge native would
acquit himself in the struggle at hand.</p>

<p>He was not kept long in doubt.  The savage observed the puma
the moment his head emerged from the shadow into the moonlight,
and he instantly prepared himself to meet him.</p>

<p>Little preparation, however, was necessary, for he carried but
the single weapon and that had only to be grasped in his right
hand.</p>

<p>The warrior might have leaped into his craft and escaped by paddling
out in the river, where he could drive the boat at a faster pace
than the beast could swim, but he did nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>He neither advanced nor retreated, but, standing just in front
of the prow, he rested on his right leg; with the left foot thrown
forward, and the tremendous javelin balanced over his right shoulder.</p>

<p>His pose was admirable, and even in that thrilling moment compelled
the admiration of the single spectator, who was strongly of the
opinion that the puma, to put it mildly, was committing an error
of judgment.</p>

<p>There may have been some strange, instinctive knowledge which
penetrated the brain of the beast before he reached the assailing
point, and which compelled him to stop.  The individual whom he
had selected as his victim was not to be crushed at a single effort,
as he was accustomed to bring down the llamas, antelope, and other
animals of the wilderness.  No; there was something in that pose,
the demeanor and the flash of the midnight eyes which forced the
fierce creature to pause, when on the very death line, as it may
be termed.</p>

<p>But if the native was defiant, the puma had no purpose of retreating
from before such a powerful enemy.  In his blind ferocity, he
would have assailed him, could it have been impressed upon him
that his own destruction would be the inevitable result.</p>

<p>The lank jaws were still parted and dripped foam, as the lion
continued his cavernous growls, while his ears lying flat on his
head in the manner peculiar to the feline species, the bristling
spine and the lashing of the tail gave the beast the appearance
of a bundle of concentrated fury, as indeed he was.</p>

<p>Fred Ashman was struck almost breathless by what followed.</p>

<p>He observed the curious, twitching movement of the puma's legs
as they were gathered closer under his body, and which is always
a sure evidence that the animal is about to make his decisive
leap upon his victim.  The native must have read the movement
aright, for the hand over his shoulder was suddenly thrown back
and instantly forward again, as his javelin left his grasp with
terrific force and the suddenness of lightning.</p>

<p>But inconceivably quick as was the action, the puma dodged the
missile, which entered the earth just behind him, and driven with
such tremendous force was buried half its length in the ground.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant the body of the lion rose in air and
shot forward as if driven from the throat of a Parrott gun.</p>

<p>But if the brute was quick, so was the man, who dropped downward
without moving his feet, and allowed his assailant to pass over
his head and land directly in the canoe, where for a single second
only he was partly hidden from sight.</p>

<p>Hardly had he landed, when the warrior darted forward several
paces to where his javelin projected from the ground, seized it
with both hands and wrenched it free.  Whirling about, he confronted
the beast once more, as he was gathering himself for a second
leap.</p>

<p>The savage learned wisdom from what had just occurred, and instead
of allowing the weapon to leave his hand, held it with an immovable
grip and awaited the renewal of the attack.</p>

<p>The puma seemed also to have absorbed some instruction from his
failure, and instead of leaping at once, began a stealthy advance,
coming over the side of the canoe with the gliding motion of a
serpent, and evidently wishing to get so near that his victim
could not escape again by the means he used before.</p>

<p>Suddenly the native, still holding the javelin with both hands,
stepped forward a single pace.  This placed him in the strongest
possible position, and, with one appalling thrust, he drove the
spear for a distance of two feet into the chest of the puma, instantly
snatching it forth again, moving back a couple of feet, and holding
himself ready for any assault from the brute.</p>

<p>No need of any virus on the point of <em>that</em> weapon, for
it had cloven the heart of the lion in twain, and he went down
without a single groan, as dead as dead could be.</p>

<p>The native stepped to the river, washed the blood from the weapon
and then turned about to resume his advance toward the wood.</p>

<p>As he did so, he found himself face to face with a white man,
who, stepping from the shadow, held his Winchester leveled at
him in an exceedingly suggestive fashion.</p>

<p>If Fred Ashman had been astonished before, what words shall describe
his amazement when the dusky Hercules, calmly staring at him for
a moment, said in unmistakable English, "<em>I surrender</em>."</p>
