<p>For eight days the boat drifted, carried by the current under the
conditions already described. No incident of any importance occurred.
For a space of many miles the river bathed the borders of superb
forests; then the country, shorn of these fine trees, spread in
jungles to the limits of the horizon.</p>

<p>If there were no natives in this country - a fact which Dick Sand did
not dream of regretting - the animals at least abounded there. Zebras
sported on the banks, elks, and &quot;caamas,&quot; a species of antelope which
were extremely graceful, and they disappeared at night to give place
to the leopards, whose growls could be heard, and even to the lions
which bounded in the tall grasses. Thus far the fugitives had not
suffered from these ferocious creatures, whether in the forests or in
the river.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, each day, generally in the afternoon, Dick Sand neared one
bank or the other, moored the boat, disembarked, and explored the
shore for a short distance.</p>

<p>In fact, it was necessary to renew their daily food. Now, in this
country, barren of all cultivation, they could not depend upon the
tapioca, the sorgho, the maize, and the fruits, which formed the
vegetable food of the native tribes. These plants only grew in a
wild state, and were not eatable. Dick Sand was thus forced to hunt,
although the firing of his gun might bring about an unpleasant
meeting.</p>

<p>They made a fire by rubbing a little stick against a piece of the wild
fig-tree, native fashion, or even simiesque style, for it is affirmed
that certain of the gorillas procure a fire by this means. Then, for
several days, they cooked a little elk or antelope flesh. During the
4th of July Dick Sand succeeded in killing, with a single ball, a
&quot;pokou,&quot; which gave them a good supply of venison. This animal, was
five feet long; it had long horns provided with rings, a yellowish red
skin, dotted with brilliant spots, and white on the stomach; and the
flesh was found to be excellent.</p>

<p>It followed then, taking into account these almost daily landings and
the hours of repose that were necessary at night, that the distance on
the 8th of July could hot be estimated as more than one hundred miles.
This was considerable, however, and already Dick Sand asked himself
where this interminable river ended. Its course absorbed some
small tributaries and did not sensibly enlarge. As for the general
direction, after having been north for a long time, it took a bend
toward the northwest.</p>

<p>However, this river furnished its share of food. Long lianes, armed
with thorns, which served as fishhooks, caught several of those
delicately-flavored &quot;sandjikas&quot;, which, once smoked, are easily
carried in this region; black &quot;usakas&quot; were also caught, and some
&quot;mormdes,&quot; with large heads, the genciva of which have teeth like the
hairs of a brush, and some little &quot;dagalas,&quot; the friends of running
waters, belonging to the clupe species, and resembling the whitebait
of the Thames.</p>

<p>During the 9th of July, Dick Sand had to give proof of extreme
coolness. He was alone on the shore, carrying off a &quot;caama,&quot; the horns
of which showed above the thicket. He had just shot it, and now there
bounded, thirty feet off, a formidable hunter, that no doubt came to
claim its prey, and was not in a humor to give it up. It was a lion of
great height, one of those which the natives call &quot;karamos,&quot; and not
one of the kind without a mane, named &quot;lion of the Nyassi.&quot; This one
measured five feet in height - a formidable beast. With one bound the
lion had fallen on the &quot;caama,&quot; which Dick Sand's ball had just thrown
to the ground, and, still full of life, it shook and cried under the
paw of the powerful animal.</p>

<p>Dick Sand was disarmed, not having had time to slide a second
cartridge into his gun.</p>

<p>Dick Sand, in front, lowering his voice, gave directions to avoid
striking against these rotten constructions. The night was clear. They
saw well to direct the boat, but they could also be seen.</p>

<p>Then came a terrible moment. Two natives, who talked in loud tones,
were squatting close to the water on the piles, between which the
current carried the boat, and the direction could not be changed for
a narrower pass. Now, would they not see it, and at their cries might
not the whole village be alarmed?</p>

<p>A space of a hundred feet at most remained to be passed, when Dick
Sand heard the two natives call more quickly to each other. One showed
the other the mass of drifting herbs, which threatened to break the
long liane ropes which they were occupied in stretching at that
moment.</p>

<p>Rising hastily, they called out for help. Five or six other blacks ran
at once along the piles and posted themselves on the cross-beams which
supported them, uttering loud exclamations which the listeners could
not understand.</p>

<p>In the boat, on the contrary, was absolute silence, except for the few
orders given by Dick Sand in a low voice, and complete repose, except
the movement of Hercules's right arm moving the oar; at times a low
growl from Dingo, whose jaws Jack held together with his little hands;
outside, the murmur of the water which broke against the piles, then
above, the cries of the ferocious cannibals.</p>

<p>The natives, meanwhile, rapidly drew up their ropes. If they were
raised in time the boat would pass, otherwise it would be caught, and
all would be over with those who drifted in it! As for slackening or
stopping its progress, Dick Sand could do neither, for the current,
stronger under this narrow construction, carried it forward more
rapidly.</p>

<p>In half a minute the boat was caught between the piles. By an
unheard-of piece of fortune, the last effort made by the natives had
raised the ropes.</p>

<p>But in passing, as Dick Sand had feared, the boat was deprived of a
part of the grasses which now floated at its right.</p>

<p>One of the natives uttered a cry. Had he had time to recognize what
the roof covered, and was he going to alarm his comrades? It was more
than probable.</p>

<p>Dick Sand and his friends were already out of reach, and in a few
moments, under the impetus of this current, now changed into a kind of
rapid, they had lost sight of the lacustrine village.</p>

<p>&quot;To the left bank!&quot; Dick Sand ordered, as being more prudent. &quot;The
stream is again navigable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To the left bank!&quot; replied Hercules, giving the oar a vigorous
stroke.</p>

<p>Dick Sand stood beside him and looked at the surface of the water,
which the moon lit up. He saw nothing suspicious. Not a boat had
started in pursuit. Perhaps these savages had none; and at daybreak
not a native appeared, either on the bank or on the water. After that,
increasing their precautions, the boat kept close to the left bank.</p>

<p>During the four following days, from the 11th to the 14th of July,
Mrs. Weldon and her companions remarked that this portion of the
territory had decidedly changed. It was no longer a deserted country;
it was also a desert, and they might have compared it to that Kalahari
explored by Livingstone on his first voyage.</p>

<p>The arid soil recalled nothing of the fertile fields of the upper
country.</p>

<p>And always this interminable stream, to which might be given the name
of river, as it seemed that it could only end at the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>The question of food, in this desert country, became a problem.
Nothing remained of their former stock. Fishing gave little; hunting
was no longer of any use. Elks, antelopes, pokous, and other animals,
could find nothing to live on in this desert, and with them had also
disappeared the carnivorous animals.</p>

<p>The nights no longer echoed the accustomed roarings. Nothing broke
the silence but the concert of frogs, which Cameron compares with the
noise of calkers calking a ship; with riveters who rivet, and the
drillers who drill, in a shipbuilder's yard.</p>

<p>The country on the two banks was flat and destitute of trees as far
as the most distant hills that bounded it on the east and west. The
spurges grew alone and in profusion - not the euphosbium which produces
cassava or tapioca flour, but those from which they draw an oil which
does not serve as food.</p>

<p>Meantime it is necessary to provide some nourishment.</p>

<p>Dick Sand knew not what to do, and Hercules reminded him that the
natives often eat the young shoots of the ferns and the pith which the
papyrus leaf contains. He himself, while following the caravan of Ibn
Ilamis across the desert, had been more than once reduced to this
expedient to satisfy his hunger. Happily, the ferns and the papyrus
grew in profusion along the banks, and the marrow or pith, which has a
sweet flavor, was appreciated by all, particularly by little Jack.</p>

<p>This was not a very cheering prospect; the food was not strengthening,
but the next day, thanks to Cousin Benedict, they were better served.
Since the discovery of the &quot;Hexapodus Benedictus,&quot; which was to
immortalize his name, Cousin Benedict had recovered his usual manners.
The insect was put in a safe place, that is to say, stuck in the crown
of his hat, and the savant had recommenced his search whenever they
were on shore. During that day, while hunting in the high grass, he
started a bird whose warbling attracted him.</p>

<p>Dick Sand was going to shoot it, when Cousin Benedict cried out:</p>

<p>&quot;Don't fire, Dick! Don't fire! A bird among five persons would not be
enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will be enough for Jack,&quot; replied Dick Sand, taking aim at the
bird, which was in no hurry to fly away.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no!&quot; said Cousin Benedict, &quot;do not fire! It is an indicator, and
it will bring us honey in abundance.&quot;</p>

<p>Dick Sand lowered his gun, realizing that a few pounds of honey were
worth more than one bird; and Cousin Benedict and he followed the
bird, which rose and flew away, inviting them to go with it.</p>

<p>They had not far to go, and a few minutes after, some old trunks,
hidden in between the spurges, appeared in the midst of an intense
buzzing of bees.</p>

<p>Cousin Benedict would have preferred not to have robbed these
industrious hymenopters of the &quot;fruit of their labors,&quot; as he
expressed it. But Dick Sand did not understand it in that way. He
smoked out the bees with some dry herbs and obtained a considerable
quantity of honey. Then leaving to the indicator the cakes of wax,
which made its share of the profit, Cousin Benedict and he returned to
the boat.</p>

<p>The honey was well received, but it was but little, and, in fact, all
would have suffered cruelly from hunger, if, during the day of the
12th, the boat had not stopped near a creek where some locusts
swarmed. They covered the ground and the shrubs in myriads, two or
three deep. Now, Cousin Benedict not failing to say that the natives
frequently eat these orthopters - which was perfectly true - they took
possession of this manna. There was enough to fill the boat ten times,
and broiled over a mild fire, these edible locusts would have seemed
excellent even to less famished people. Cousin Benedict, for his part,
eat a notable quantity of them, sighing, it is true - still, he eat
them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was time for this long series of moral and physical
trials to come to an end. Although drifting on this rapid river was
not so fatiguing as had been the walking through the first forests
near the coast, still, the excessive heat of the day, the damp mists
at night, and the incessant attacks of the mosquitoes, made this
descent of the watercourse very painful. It was time to arrive
somewhere, and yet Dick Sand could see no limit to the journey. Would
it last eight days or a month? Nothing indicated an answer. Had the
river flowed directly to the west, they would have already reached the
northern coast of Angola; but the general direction had been rather to
the north, and they could travel thus a long time before reaching the
coast.</p>

<p>Dick Sand was, therefore, extremely anxious, when a sudden change of
direction took place on the morning of the 14th of July.</p>

<p>Little Jack was in the front of the boat, and he was gazing through
the thatch, when a large expanse of water appeared on the horizon.</p>

<p>&quot;The sea!&quot; he shouted.</p>

<p>At this word Dick Sand trembled, and came close to little Jack.</p>

<p>&quot;The sea?&quot; he replied. &quot;No, not yet; but at least a river which flows
toward the west, and of which this stream is only a tributary. Perhaps
it is the Zaire itself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May God grant that is!&quot; replied Mrs. Weldon.</p>

<p>Yes; for if this were the Zaire or Congo, which Stanley was to
discover a few years later, they had only to descend its course so as
to reach the Portuguese settlements at its mouth. Dick Sand hoped that
it might be so, and he was inclined to believe it.</p>

<p>During the 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th of July, in the midst of a more
fertile country, the boat drifted on the silvery waters of the river.
They still took the same precautions, and it was always a mass of
herbs that the current seemed to carry on its surface.</p>

<p>A few days more, and no doubt the survivors of the &quot;Pilgrim&quot; would see
the termination of their miseries. Self-sacrifice had been shared in
by all, and if the young novice would not claim the greater part of
it, Mrs. Weldon would demand its recognition for him.</p>

<p>But on the 18th of July, during the night, an incident took place
which compromised the safety of the party. Toward three o'clock in the
morning a distant noise, still very low, was heard in the west. Dick
Sand, very anxious, wished to know what caused it. While Mrs. Weldon,
Jack, and Cousin Benedict slept in the bottom of the boat, he called
Hercules to the front, and told him to listen with the greatest
attention. The night was calm. Not a breeze stirred the atmosphere.</p>

<p>&quot;It is the noise of the sea,&quot; said Hercules, whose eyes shone with
joy.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Dick Sand, holding down his head.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it then?&quot; asked Hercules.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait until day; but we must watch with the greatest care.&quot;</p>

<p>At this answer, Hercules returned to his post.</p>

<p>Dick Sand stood in front, listening all the time. The noise increased.
It was soon like distant roaring.</p>

<p>Day broke almost without dawn. About half a mile down the river, just
above the water, a sort of cloud floated in the atmosphere. But it was
not a mass of vapor, and this became only too evident, when, under
the first solar rays, which broke in piercing it, a beautiful rainbow
spread from one bank to the other.</p>

<p>&quot;To the shore!&quot; cried Dick Sand, whose voice awoke Mrs. Weldon. &quot;It is
a cataract! Those clouds are spray! To the shore, Hercules!&quot;</p>

<p>Dick Sand was not mistaken. Before them, the bed of the river broke in
a descent of more than a hundred feet, and the waters rushed down with
superb but irresistible impetuosity. Another half mile, and the boat
would have been engulfed in the abyss.</p>
