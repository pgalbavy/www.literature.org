<p>Though Mr. Frog agreed cheerfully to show his neighbors how to take a
mud bath, there wasn't even one of them that accepted his offer.
</p>
<p>To be sure, old Mr. Turtle remarked that there was a good deal to be
said about mud baths. And then he waddled to the water's edge and swam
away.
</p><p>"You heard what he said," Mr. Frog continued, turning to those who were
left. "It's simple enough. All one has to do is to dive down to the
bottom of the creek and bury himself snugly in the soft mud."
</p><p>"How do you breathe?" somebody inquired.
</p><p>"Oh, that's simple enough," Mr. Frog replied. "You breathe through your
skin."
</p><p>Smiles appeared on the faces of his listeners. And here and there a
cough sounded. It was plain that the company had little faith in Mr.
Frog's easy explanation.
</p><p>"Doesn't it hurt your skin to breathe through it?" some one else asked.
</p><p>"What if it does?" Ferdinand Frog retorted. "When your skin becomes
worn, pull it off!"
</p><p>Everybody laughed heartily at his answer; or at least, everybody except
Long Bill Wren and his wife. They exchanged a thoughtful look. For they
knew Mr. Frog's ways better than his other neighbors did.
</p><p>Now, Ferdinand Frog did not mind the laughter at all.
</p><p>"Of course," he went on, "you can't breathe through your skin quite so
well as you can in the <u>regular</u> way. After you have stayed in the mud a
while, you'll begin to want a <u>regular</u> breath of fresh air. So then you
come up to the top of the water."
</p><p>"Cat-tails and pussy-willows!" Long Bill Wren cried out. "I'm sure I
shall never take a mud bath. They seem to me to be very dangerous."
</p><p>"Not at all!" Mr. Frog assured him. "They're as safe as standing on your
head." And thereupon he stood on his own head, to prove that what he
said was true.
</p><p>Still the company was not moved to take Mr. Frog's advice and try a mud
bath. Most of them declared that nothing could induce them to undertake
such a risky act. But a few daring ones said that if all the rest would
take mud baths, and if they found that they liked them, they themselves
would be willing to test them too.
</p><p>However, nobody took a single step towards the creek. So at last the
company scattered, leaving Long Bill Wren and Mr. Frog alone upon the
bank.
</p><p>Meanwhile Long Bill had been thinking deeply. He had begun to wonder
whether there might not be some good in a mud bath, in spite of his
neighbors' doubts. And now he turned to Ferdinand Frog and began
speaking in a hushed voice.
</p><p>"Don't tell my wife I asked you this question," he said; "but I should
like to know if mud baths are good for rheumatism."
</p><p>"Good for it!" Mr. Frog exclaimed. "Why, they're a sure cure--and the
only one!"
