<p>
The antique Persians taught three useful things,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To draw the bow, to ride, and speak the truth.<br/>
This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A mode adopted since by modern youth.<br/>
Bows have they, generally with two strings;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Horses they ride without remorse or ruth;<br/>
At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,<br/>
But draw the long bow better now than ever.

</p>
<p>
The cause of this effect, or this defect,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'For this effect defective comes by cause,'-<br/>
Is what I have not leisure to inspect;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But this I must say in my own applause,<br/>
Of all the Muses that I recollect,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whate'er may be her follies or her flaws<br/>
In some things, mine 's beyond all contradiction<br/>
The most sincere that ever dealt in fiction.

</p>
<p>
And as she treats all things, and ne'er retreats<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From any thing, this epic will contain<br/>
A wilderness of the most rare conceits,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which you might elsewhere hope to find in vain.<br/>
'T is true there be some bitters with the sweets,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet mix'd so slightly, that you can't complain,<br/>
But wonder they so few are, since my tale is<br/>
'De rebus cunctis et quibusdam aliis.'

</p>
<p>
But of all truths which she has told, the most<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;True is that which she is about to tell.<br/>
I said it was a story of a ghost&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What then? I only know it so befell.<br/>
Have you explored the limits of the coast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell?<br/>
'T is time to strike such puny doubters dumb as<br/>
The sceptics who would not believe Columbus.

</p>
<p>
Some people would impose now with authority,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Turpin's or Monmouth Geoffry's Chronicle;<br/>
Men whose historical superiority<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is always greatest at a miracle.<br/>
But Saint Augustine has the great priority,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who bids all men believe the impossible,<br/>
Because 't is so. Who nibble, scribble, quibble, he<br/>
Quiets at once with 'quia impossibile.'

</p>
<p>
And therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe:&mdash;if 't is improbable you must,<br/>
And if it is impossible, you shall:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is always best to take things upon trust.<br/>
I do not speak profanely, to recall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those holier mysteries which the wise and just<br/>
Receive as gospel, and which grow more rooted,<br/>
As all truths must, the more they are disputed:

</p>
<p>
I merely mean to say what Johnson said,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That in the course of some six thousand years,<br/>
All nations have believed that from the dead<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A visitant at intervals appears;<br/>
And what is strangest upon this strange head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is, that whatever bar the reason rears<br/>
'Gainst such belief, there 's something stronger still<br/>
In its behalf, let those deny who will.

</p>
<p>
The dinner and the soiree too were done,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The supper too discuss'd, the dames admired,<br/>
The banqueteers had dropp'd off one by one&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The song was silent, and the dance expired:<br/>
The last thin petticoats were vanish'd, gone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like fleecy Clouds into the sky retired,<br/>
And nothing brighter gleam'd through the saloon<br/>
Than dying tapers&mdash;and the peeping moon.

</p>
<p>
The evaporation of a joyous day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is like the last glass of champagne, without<br/>
The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or like a system coupled with a doubt;<br/>
Or like a soda bottle when its spray<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has sparkled and let half its spirit out;<br/>
Or like a billow left by storms behind,<br/>
Without the animation of the wind;

</p>
<p>
Or like an opiate, which brings troubled rest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or none; or like&mdash;like nothing that I know<br/>
Except itself;&mdash;such is the human breast;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing, of which similitudes can show<br/>
No real likeness,&mdash;like the old Tyrian vest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,<br/>
If from a shell-fish or from cochineal.<br/>
So perish every tyrant's robe piece-meal!

</p>
<p>
But next to dressing for a rout or ball,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Undressing is a woe; our robe de chambre<br/>
May sit like that of Nessus, and recall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts quite as yellow, but less clear than amber.<br/>
Titus exclaim'd, 'I 've lost a day!' Of all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The nights and days most people can remember<br/>
(I have had of both, some not to be disdain'd),<br/>
I wish they 'd state how many they have gain'd.

</p>
<p>
And Juan, on retiring for the night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt restless, and perplex'd, and compromised:<br/>
He thought Aurora Raby's eyes more bright<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Adeline (such is advice) advised;<br/>
If he had known exactly his own plight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He probably would have philosophised:<br/>
A great resource to all, and ne'er denied<br/>
Till wanted; therefore Juan only sigh'd.

</p>
<p>
He sigh'd;&mdash;the next resource is the full moon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all sighs are deposited; and now<br/>
It happen'd luckily, the chaste orb shone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As clear as such a climate will allow;<br/>
And Juan's mind was in the proper tone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To hail her with the apostrophe&mdash;'O thou!'<br/>
Of amatory egotism the Tuism,<br/>
Which further to explain would be a truism.

</p>
<p>
But lover, poet, or astronomer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shepherd, or swain, whoever may behold,<br/>
Feel some abstraction when they gaze on her:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold<br/>
Sometimes, unless my feelings rather err);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;<br/>
The ocean's tides and mortals' brains she sways,<br/>
And also hearts, if there be truth in lays.

</p>
<p>
Juan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For contemplation rather than his pillow:<br/>
The Gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let in the rippling sound of the lake's billow,<br/>
With all the mystery by midnight caused;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Below his window waved (of course) a willow;<br/>
And he stood gazing out on the cascade<br/>
That flash'd and after darken'd in the shade.

</p>
<p>
Upon his table or his toilet,&mdash;which<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these is not exactly ascertain'd<br/>
(I state this, for I am cautious to a pitch<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nicety, where a fact is to be gain'd),&mdash;<br/>
A lamp burn'd high, while he leant from a niche,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where many a Gothic ornament remain'd,<br/>
In chisell'd stone and painted glass, and all<br/>
That time has left our fathers of their hall.

</p>
<p>
Then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His chamber door wide open&mdash;and went forth<br/>
Into a gallery, of a sombre hue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Long, furnish'd with old pictures of great worth,<br/>
Of knights and dames heroic and chaste too,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As doubtless should be people of high birth.<br/>
But by dim lights the portraits of the dead<br/>
Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.

</p>
<p>
The forms of the grim knight and pictured saint<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look living in the moon; and as you turn<br/>
Backward and forward to the echoes faint<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your own footsteps&mdash;voices from the urn<br/>
Appear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,<br/>
As if to ask how you can dare to keep<br/>
A vigil there, where all but death should sleep.

</p>
<p>
And the pale smile of beauties in the grave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The charms of other days, in starlight gleams,<br/>
Glimmer on high; their buried locks still wave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams<br/>
On ours, or spars within some dusky cave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But death is imaged in their shadowy beams.<br/>
A picture is the past; even ere its frame<br/>
Be gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same.

</p>
<p>
As Juan mused on mutability,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or on his mistress&mdash;terms synonymous&mdash;<br/>
No sound except the echo of his sigh<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or step ran sadly through that antique house;<br/>
When suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A supernatural agent&mdash;or a mouse,<br/>
Whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass<br/>
Most people as it plays along the arras.

</p>
<p>
It was no mouse, but lo! a monk, array'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In cowl and beads and dusky garb, appear'd,<br/>
Now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;<br/>
His garments only a slight murmur made;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,<br/>
But slowly; and as he pass'd Juan by,<br/>
Glanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye.

</p>
<p>
Juan was petrified; he had heard a hint<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such a spirit in these halls of old,<br/>
But thought, like most men, there was nothing in 't<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,<br/>
Coin'd from surviving superstition's mint,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,<br/>
But rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.<br/>
And did he see this? or was it a vapour?

</p>
<p>
Once, twice, thrice pass'd, repass'd&mdash;the thing of air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or earth beneath, or heaven, or t' other place;<br/>
And Juan gazed upon it with a stare,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base<br/>
As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;<br/>
He tax'd his tongue for words, which were not granted,<br/>
To ask the reverend person what he wanted.

</p>
<p>
The third time, after a still longer pause,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow pass'd away&mdash;but where? the hall<br/>
Was long, and thus far there was no great cause<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To think his vanishing unnatural:<br/>
Doors there were many, through which, by the laws<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of physics, bodies whether short or tall<br/>
Might come or go; but Juan could not state<br/>
Through which the spectre seem'd to evaporate.

</p>
<p>
He stood&mdash;how long he knew not, but it seem'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An age&mdash;expectant, powerless, with his eyes<br/>
Strain'd on the spot where first the figure gleam'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then by degrees recall'd his energies,<br/>
And would have pass'd the whole off as a dream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,<br/>
Waking already, and return'd at length<br/>
Back to his chamber, shorn of half his strength.

</p>
<p>
All there was as he left it: still his taper<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Burnt, and not blue, as modest tapers use,<br/>
Receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He rubb'd his eyes, and they did not refuse<br/>
Their office; he took up an old newspaper;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper was right easy to peruse;<br/>
He read an article the king attacking,<br/>
And a long eulogy of 'patent blacking.'

</p>
<p>
This savour'd of this world; but his hand shook&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He shut his door, and after having read<br/>
A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Undrest, and rather slowly went to bed.<br/>
There, couch'd all snugly on his pillow's nook,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;<br/>
And though it was no opiate, slumber crept<br/>
Upon him by degrees, and so he slept.

</p>
<p>
He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ponder'd upon his visitant or vision,<br/>
And whether it ought not to be disclosed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At risk of being quizz'd for superstition.<br/>
The more he thought, the more his mind was posed:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mean time, his valet, whose precision<br/>
Was great, because his master brook'd no less,<br/>
Knock'd to inform him it was time to dress.

</p>
<p>
He dress'd; and like young people he was wont<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To take some trouble with his toilet, but<br/>
This morning rather spent less time upon 't;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside his very mirror soon was put;<br/>
His curls fell negligently o'er his front,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His clothes were not curb'd to their usual cut,<br/>
His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied<br/>
Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.

</p>
<p>
And when he walk'd down into the saloon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,<br/>
Which he perhaps had not discover'd soon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had it not happen'd scalding hot to be,<br/>
Which made him have recourse unto his spoon;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So much distrait he was, that all could see<br/>
That something was the matter<br/>
&mdash;Adeline<br/>
The first&mdash;but what she could not well divine.

</p>
<p>
She look'd, and saw him pale, and turn'd as pale<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Herself; then hastily look'd down, and mutter'd<br/>
Something, but what 's not stated in my tale.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Henry said his muffin was ill butter'd;<br/>
The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke play'd with her veil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And look'd at Juan hard, but nothing utter'd.<br/>
Aurora Raby with her large dark eyes<br/>
Survey'd him with a kind of calm surprise.

</p>
<p>
But seeing him all cold and silent still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And everybody wondering more or less,<br/>
Fair Adeline enquired, 'If he were ill?'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He started, and said, 'Yes&mdash;no&mdash;rather&mdash;yes.'<br/>
The family physician had great skill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And being present, now began to express<br/>
His readiness to feel his pulse and tell<br/>
The cause, but Juan said, 'He was quite well.'

</p>
<p>
'Quite well; yes,&mdash;no.'<br/>
&mdash;These answers were mysterious,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet his looks appear'd to sanction both,<br/>
However they might savour of delirious;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Something like illness of a sudden growth<br/>
Weigh'd on his spirit, though by no means serious:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the rest, as he himself seem'd loth<br/>
To state the case, it might be ta'en for granted<br/>
It was not the physician that he wanted.

</p>
<p>
Lord Henry, who had now discuss'd his chocolate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also the muffin whereof he complain'd,<br/>
Said, Juan had not got his usual look elate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At which he marvell'd, since it had not rain'd;<br/>
Then ask'd her Grace what news were of the duke of late?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Grace replied, his Grace was rather pain'd<br/>
With some slight, light, hereditary twinges<br/>
Of gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges.

</p>
<p>
Then Henry turn'd to Juan, and address'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words of condolence on his state:<br/>
'You look,' quoth he, 'as if you had had your rest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late.'<br/>
'What friar?' said Juan; and he did his best<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To put the question with an air sedate,<br/>
Or careless; but the effort was not valid<br/>
To hinder him from growing still more pallid.

</p>
<p>
'Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of these walls?'&mdash;'In truth not I.'<br/>
'Why Fame&mdash;but Fame you know 's sometimes a liar&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tells an odd story, of which by and by:<br/>
Whether with time the spectre has grown shyer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that our sires had a more gifted eye<br/>
For such sights, though the tale is half believed,<br/>
The friar of late has not been oft perceived.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time was""I pray," said Adeline<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who watch'd the changes of Don Juan's brow,<br/>
And from its context thought she could divine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Connexions stronger then he chose to avow<br/>
With this same legend)&mdash;'if you but design<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To jest, you 'll choose some other theme just now,<br/>
Because the present tale has oft been told,<br/>
And is not much improved by growing old.'

</p>
<p>
'Jest!' quoth Milor; 'why, Adeline, you know<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That we ourselves&mdash;'t was in the honey-moon&mdash;<br/>
Saw""Well, no matter, 'twas so long ago;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But, come, I 'll set your story to a tune.'<br/>
Graceful as Dian, when she draws her bow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon<br/>
As touch'd, and plaintively began to play<br/>
The air of ''T was a Friar of Orders Gray.'

</p>
<p>
'But add the words,' cried Henry, 'which you made;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Adeline is half a poetess,'<br/>
Turning round to the rest, he smiling said.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the others could not but express<br/>
In courtesy their wish to see display'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By one three talents, for there were no less&mdash;<br/>
The voice, the words, the harper's skill, at once<br/>
Could hardly be united by a dunce.

</p>
<p>
After some fascinating hesitation,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The charming of these charmers, who seem bound,<br/>
I can't tell why, to this dissimulation,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Adeline, with eyes fix'd on the ground<br/>
At first, then kindling into animation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,<br/>
And sang with much simplicity,&mdash;a merit<br/>
Not the less precious, that we seldom hear it.

</p>
<p>
Beware! beware! of the Black Friar,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sitteth by Norman stone,<br/>
For he mutters his prayer in the midnight air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his mass of the days that are gone.<br/>
When the Lord of the Hill, Amundeville,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made Norman Church his prey,<br/>
And expell'd the friars, one friar still<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would not be driven away.

</p>
<p>
Though he came in his might, with King Henry's right,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To turn church lands to lay,<br/>
With sword in hand, and torch to light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their walls, if they said nay;<br/>
A monk remain'd, unchased, unchain'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he did not seem form'd of clay,<br/>
For he 's seen in the porch, and he 's seen in the church,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he is not seen by day.

</p>
<p>
And whether for good, or whether for ill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not mine to say;<br/>
But still with the house of Amundeville<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He abideth night and day.<br/>
By the marriage-bed of their lords, 't is said,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He flits on the bridal eve;<br/>
And 't is held as faith, to their bed of death<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He comes&mdash;but not to grieve.

</p>
<p>
When an heir is born, he 's heard to mourn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when aught is to befall<br/>
That ancient line, in the "we moonshine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He walks from hall to hall.<br/>
His form you may trace, but not his face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is shadow'd by his cowl;<br/>
But his eyes may be seen from the folds between,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they seem of a parted soul.

</p>
<p>
But beware! beware! of the Black Friar,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He still retains his sway,<br/>
For he is yet the church's heir<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever may be the lay.<br/>
Amundeville is lord by day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the monk is lord by night;<br/>
Nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To question that friar's right.

</p>
<p>
Say nought to him as he walks the hall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he 'll say nought to you;<br/>
He sweeps along in his dusky pall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As o'er the grass the dew.<br/>
Then grammercy! for the Black Friar;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven sain him, fair or foul!<br/>
And whatsoe'er may be his prayer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let ours be for his soul.

</p>
<p>
The lady's voice ceased, and the thrilling wires<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Died from the touch that kindled them to sound;<br/>
And the pause follow'd, which when song expires<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pervades a moment those who listen round;<br/>
And then of course the circle much admires,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor less applauds, as in politeness bound,<br/>
The tones, the feeling, and the execution,<br/>
To the performer's diffident confusion.

</p>
<p>
Fair Adeline, though in a careless way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she rated such accomplishment<br/>
As the mere pastime of an idle day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursued an instant for her own content,<br/>
Would now and then as 't were without display,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet with display in fact, at times relent<br/>
To such performances with haughty smile,<br/>
To show she could, if it were worth her while.

</p>
<p>
Now this (but we will whisper it aside)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was&mdash;pardon the pedantic illustration&mdash;<br/>
Trampling on Plato's pride with greater pride,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As did the Cynic on some like occasion;<br/>
Deeming the sage would be much mortified,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thrown into a philosophic passion,<br/>
For a spoil'd carpet&mdash;but the 'Attic Bee'<br/>
Was much consoled by his own repartee.

</p>
<p>
Thus Adeline would throw into the shade<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(By doing easily, whene'er she chose,<br/>
What dilettanti do with vast parade)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sort of half profession; for it grows<br/>
To something like this when too oft display'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that it is so everybody knows<br/>
Who have heard Miss That or This, or Lady T'other,<br/>
Show off&mdash;to please their company or mother.

</p>
<p>
O! the long evenings of duets and trios!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The admirations and the speculations;<br/>
The 'Mamma Mia's!' and the 'Amor Mio's!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'Tanti palpiti's' on such occasions:<br/>
The 'Lasciami's,' and quavering 'Addio's!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst our own most musical of nations;<br/>
With 'Tu mi chamas's' from Portingale,<br/>
To soothe our ears, lest Italy should fail.

</p>
<p>
In Babylon's bravuras&mdash;as the home<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart-ballads of Green Erin or Gray Highlands,<br/>
That bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er far Atlantic continents or islands,<br/>
The calentures of music which o'ercome<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands,<br/>
No more to be beheld but in such visions&mdash;<br/>
Was Adeline well versed, as compositions.

</p>
<p>
She also had a twilight tinge of 'Blue,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could write rhymes, and compose more than she wrote,<br/>
Made epigrams occasionally too<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon her friends, as everybody ought.<br/>
But still from that sublimer azure hue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So much the present dye, she was remote;<br/>
Was weak enough to deem Pope a great poet,<br/>
And what was worse, was not ashamed to show it.

</p>
<p>
Aurora&mdash;since we are touching upon taste,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which now-a-days is the thermometer<br/>
By whose degrees all characters are class'd&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was more Shakspearian, if I do not err.<br/>
The worlds beyond this world's perplexing waste<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had more of her existence, for in her<br/>
There was a depth of feeling to embrace<br/>
Thoughts, boundless, deep, but silent too as Space.

</p>
<p>
Not so her gracious, graceful, graceless Grace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The full-grown Hebe of Fitz-Fulke, whose mind,<br/>
If she had any, was upon her face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was of a fascinating kind.<br/>
A little turn for mischief you might trace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also thereon,&mdash;but that 's not much; we find<br/>
Few females without some such gentle leaven,<br/>
For fear we should suppose us quite in heaven.

</p>
<p>
I have not heard she was at all poetic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though once she was seen reading the 'Bath Guide,'<br/>
And 'Hayley's Triumphs,' which she deem'd pathetic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she said her temper had been tried<br/>
So much, the bard had really been prophetic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what she had gone through with&mdash;since a bride.<br/>
But of all verse, what most ensured her praise<br/>
Were sonnets to herself, or 'bouts rimes.'

</p>
<p>
'T were difficult to say what was the object<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Adeline, in bringing this same lay<br/>
To bear on what appear'd to her the subject<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Juan's nervous feelings on that day.<br/>
Perhaps she merely had the simple project<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To laugh him out of his supposed dismay;<br/>
Perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,<br/>
Though why I cannot say&mdash;at least this minute.

</p>
<p>
But so far the immediate effect<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was to restore him to his self-propriety,<br/>
A thing quite necessary to the elect,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wish to take the tone of their society:<br/>
In which you cannot be too circumspect,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the mode be persiflage or piety,<br/>
But wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,<br/>
On pain of much displeasing the gynocracy.

</p>
<p>
And therefore Juan now began to rally<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirits, and without more explanation<br/>
To jest upon such themes in many a sally.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Grace, too, also seized the same occasion,<br/>
With various similar remarks to tally,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But wish'd for a still more detail'd narration<br/>
Of this same mystic friar's curious doings,<br/>
About the present family's deaths and wooings.

</p>
<p>
Of these few could say more than has been said;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They pass'd as such things do, for superstition<br/>
With some, while others, who had more in dread<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The theme, half credited the strange tradition;<br/>
And much was talk'd on all sides on that head:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Juan, when cross-question'd on the vision,<br/>
Which some supposed (though he had not avow'd it)<br/>
Had stirr'd him, answer'd in a way to cloud it.

</p>
<p>
And then, the mid-day having worn to one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The company prepared to separate;<br/>
Some to their several pastimes, or to none,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some wondering 't was so early, some so late.<br/>
There was a goodly match too, to be run<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between some greyhounds on my lord's estate,<br/>
And a young race-horse of old pedigree<br/>
Match'd for the spring, whom several went to see.

</p>
<p>
There was a picture-dealer who had brought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A special Titian, warranted original,<br/>
So precious that it was not to be bought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though princes the possessor were besieging all.<br/>
The king himself had cheapen'd it, but thought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil list he deigns to accept (obliging all<br/>
His subjects by his gracious acceptation)<br/>
Too scanty, in these times of low taxation.

</p>
<p>
But as Lord Henry was a connoisseur,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The friend of artists, if not arts,&mdash;the owner,<br/>
With motives the most classical and pure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So that he would have been the very donor,<br/>
Rather than seller, had his wants been fewer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So much he deem'd his patronage an honour,<br/>
Had brought the capo d'opera, not for sale,<br/>
But for his judgment&mdash;never known to fail.

</p>
<p>
There was a modern Goth, I mean a Gothic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bricklayer of Babel, call'd an architect,<br/>
Brought to survey these grey walls, which though so thick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Might have from time acquired some slight defect;<br/>
Who after rummaging the Abbey through thick<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thin, produced a plan whereby to erect<br/>
New buildings of correctest conformation,<br/>
And throw down old&mdash;which he call'd restoration.

</p>
<p>
The cost would be a trifle&mdash;an 'old song,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Set to some thousands ('t is the usual burden<br/>
Of that same tune, when people hum it long)&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The price would speedily repay its worth in<br/>
An edifice no less sublime than strong,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By which Lord Henry's good taste would go forth in<br/>
Its glory, through all ages shining sunny,<br/>
For Gothic daring shown in English money.

</p>
<p>
There were two lawyers busy on a mortgage<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Henry wish'd to raise for a new purchase;<br/>
Also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And one on tithes, which sure are Discord's torches,<br/>
Kindling Religion till she throws down her gage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Untying' squires 'to fight against the churches;'<br/>
There was a prize ox, a prize pig, and ploughman,<br/>
For Henry was a sort of Sabine showman.

</p>
<p>
There were two poachers caught in a steel trap,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready for gaol, their place of convalescence;<br/>
There was a country girl in a close cap<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since&mdash;<br/>
Since&mdash;since&mdash;in youth, I had the sad mishap&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But luckily I have paid few parish fees since):<br/>
That scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,<br/>
Presents the problem of a double figure.

</p>
<p>
A reel within a bottle is a mystery,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One can't tell how it e'er got in or out;<br/>
Therefore the present piece of natural history<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave to those who are fond of solving doubt;<br/>
And merely state, though not for the consistory,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Henry was a justice, and that Scout<br/>
The constable, beneath a warrant's banner,<br/>
Had bagg'd this poacher upon Nature's manor.

</p>
<p>
Now justices of peace must judge all pieces<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mischief of all kinds, and keep the game<br/>
And morals of the country from caprices<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who have not a license for the same;<br/>
And of all things, excepting tithes and leases,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps these are most difficult to tame:<br/>
Preserving partridges and pretty wenches<br/>
Are puzzles to the most precautious benches.

</p>
<p>
The present culprit was extremely pale,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale as if painted so; her cheek being red<br/>
By nature, as in higher dames less hale<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is white, at least when they just rise from bed.<br/>
Perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor soul! for she was country born and bred,<br/>
And knew no better in her immorality<br/>
Than to wax white&mdash;for blushes are for quality.

</p>
<p>
Her black, bright, downcast, yet espiegle eye,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had gather'd a large tear into its corner,<br/>
Which the poor thing at times essay'd to dry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For she was not a sentimental mourner<br/>
Parading all her sensibility,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner,<br/>
But stood in trembling, patient tribulation,<br/>
To be call'd up for her examination.

</p>
<p>
Of course these groups were scatter'd here and there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not nigh the gay saloon of ladies gent.<br/>
The lawyers in the study; and in air<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The prize pig, ploughman, poachers; the men sent<br/>
From town, viz., architect and dealer, were<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Both busy (as a general in his tent<br/>
Writing despatches) in their several stations,<br/>
Exulting in their brilliant lucubrations.

</p>
<p>
But this poor girl was left in the great hall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While Scout, the parish guardian of the frail,<br/>
Discuss'd (he hated beer yclept the 'small')<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A mighty mug of moral double ale.<br/>
She waited until justice could recall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its kind attentions to their proper pale,<br/>
To name a thing in nomenclature rather<br/>
Perplexing for most virgins&mdash;a child's father.

</p>
<p>
You see here was enough of occupation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Lord Henry, link'd with dogs and horses.<br/>
There was much bustle too, and preparation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Below stairs on the score of second courses;<br/>
Because, as suits their rank and situation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who in counties have great land resources<br/>
Have 'Public days,' when all men may carouse,<br/>
Though not exactly what 's call'd 'open house.'

</p>
<p>
But once a week or fortnight, uninvited<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Thus we translate a general invitation),<br/>
All country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May drop in without cards, and take their station<br/>
At the full board, and sit alike delighted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With fashionable wines and conversation;<br/>
And, as the isthmus of the grand connection,<br/>
Talk o'er themselves the past and next election.

</p>
<p>
Lord Henry was a great electioneerer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit;<br/>
But county contests cost him rather dearer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the neighbouring Scotch Earl of Giftgabbit<br/>
Had English influence in the self-same sphere here;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,<br/>
Was member for the 'other interest' (meaning<br/>
The same self-interest, with a different leaning).

</p>
<p>
Courteous and cautious therefore in his county,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He was all things to all men, and dispensed<br/>
To some civility, to others bounty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And promises to all&mdash;which last commenced<br/>
To gather to a somewhat large amount, he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not calculating how much they condensed;<br/>
But what with keeping some, and breaking others,<br/>
His word had the same value as another's.

</p>
<p>
A friend to freedom and freeholders&mdash;yet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No less a friend to government&mdash;he held,<br/>
That he exactly the just medium hit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt place and patriotism&mdash;albeit compell'd,<br/>
Such was his sovereign's pleasure (though unfit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He added modestly, when rebels rail'd),<br/>
To hold some sinecures he wish'd abolish'd,<br/>
But that with them all law would be demolish'd.

</p>
<p>
He was 'free to confess' (whence comes this phrase?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is 't English? No&mdash;'t is only parliamentary)<br/>
That innovation's spirit now-a-days<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had made more progress than for the last century.<br/>
He would not tread a factious path to praise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though for the public weal disposed to venture high;<br/>
As for his place, he could but say this of it,<br/>
That the fatigue was greater than the profit.

</p>
<p>
Heaven, and his friends, knew that a private life<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had ever been his sole and whole ambition;<br/>
But could he quit his king in times of strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which threaten'd the whole country with perdition?<br/>
When demagogues would with a butcher's knife<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut through and through (oh! damnable incision!)<br/>
The Gordian or the Geordi-an knot, whose strings<br/>
Have tied together commons, lords, and kings.

</p>
<p>
Sooner 'come lace into the civil list<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And champion him to the utmost'&mdash;he would keep it,<br/>
Till duly disappointed or dismiss'd:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Profit he care not for, let others reap it;<br/>
But should the day come when place ceased to exist,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The country would have far more cause to weep it:<br/>
For how could it go on? Explain who can!<br/>
He gloried in the name of Englishman.

</p>
<p>
He was as independent&mdash;ay, much more&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than those who were not paid for independence,<br/>
As common soldiers, or a common&mdash;shore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have in their several arts or parts ascendance<br/>
O'er the irregulars in lust or gore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who do not give professional attendance.<br/>
Thus on the mob all statesmen are as eager<br/>
To prove their pride, as footmen to a beggar.

</p>
<p>
All this (save the last stanza) Henry said,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought. I say no more<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I 've said too much;<br/>
For all of us have either heard or read&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Off&mdash;or upon the hustings&mdash;some slight such<br/>
Hints from the independent heart or head<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the official candidate. I 'll touch<br/>
No more on this&mdash;the dinner-bell hath rung,<br/>
And grace is said; the grace I should have sung&mdash;

</p>
<p>
But I 'm too late, and therefore must make play.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was a great banquet, such as Albion old<br/>
Was wont to boast&mdash;as if a glutton's tray<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were something very glorious to behold.<br/>
But 't was a public feast and public day,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite full, right dull, guests hot, and dishes cold,<br/>
Great plenty, much formality, small cheer,<br/>
And every body out of their own sphere.

</p>
<p>
The squires familiarly formal, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My lords and ladies proudly condescending;<br/>
The very servants puzzling how to hand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their plates&mdash;without it might be too much bending<br/>
From their high places by the sideboard's stand&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, like their masters, fearful of offending.<br/>
For any deviation from the graces<br/>
Might cost both man and master too&mdash;their places.

</p>
<p>
There were some hunters bold, and coursers keen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose hounds ne'er err'd, nor greyhounds deign'd to lurch;<br/>
Some deadly shots too, Septembrizers, seen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Earliest to rise, and last to quit the search<br/>
Of the poor partridge through his stubble screen.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some massy members of the church,<br/>
Takers of tithes, and makers of good matches,<br/>
And several who sung fewer psalms than catches.

</p>
<p>
There were some country wags too&mdash;and, alas!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some exiles from the town, who had been driven<br/>
To gaze, instead of pavement, upon grass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And rise at nine in lieu of long eleven.<br/>
And lo! upon that day it came to pass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I sate next that o'erwhelming son of heaven,<br/>
The very powerful parson, Peter Pith,<br/>
The loudest wit I e'er was deafen'd with.

</p>
<p>
I knew him in his livelier London days,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A brilliant diner out, though but a curate;<br/>
And not a joke he cut but earn'd its praise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until preferment, coming at a sure rate<br/>
(O Providence! how wondrous are thy ways!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate?),<br/>
Gave him, to lay the devil who looks o'er Lincoln,<br/>
A fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on.

</p>
<p>
His jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But both were thrown away amongst the fens;<br/>
For wit hath no great friend in aguish folks.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer ready ears and short-hand pens<br/>
Imbibed the gay bon-mot, or happy hoax:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor priest was reduced to common sense,<br/>
Or to coarse efforts very loud and long,<br/>
To hammer a horse laugh from the thick throng.

</p>
<p>
There is a difference, says the song, 'between<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A beggar and a queen,' or was (of late<br/>
The latter worse used of the two we 've seen&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But we 'll say nothing of affairs of state);<br/>
A difference ''twixt a bishop and a dean,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A difference between crockery ware and plate,<br/>
As between English beef and Spartan broth&mdash;<br/>
And yet great heroes have been bred by both.

</p>
<p>
But of all nature's discrepancies, none<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the whole is greater than the difference<br/>
Beheld between the country and the town,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which the latter merits every preference<br/>
From those who have few resources of their own,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And only think, or act, or feel, with reference<br/>
To some small plan of interest or ambition&mdash;<br/>
Both which are limited to no condition.

</p>
<p>
But 'en avant!' The light loves languish o'er<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Long banquets and too many guests, although<br/>
A slight repast makes people love much more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacchus and Ceres being, as we know<br/>
Even from our grammar upwards, friends of yore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With vivifying Venus, who doth owe<br/>
To these the invention of champagne and truffles:<br/>
Temperance delights her, but long fasting ruffles.

</p>
<p>
Dully past o'er the dinner of the day;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Juan took his place, he knew not where,<br/>
Confused, in the confusion, and distrait,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sitting as if nail'd upon his chair:<br/>
Though knives and forks clank'd round as in a fray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He seem'd unconscious of all passing there,<br/>
Till some one, with a groan, exprest a wish<br/>
(Unheeded twice) to have a fin of fish.

</p>
<p>
On which, at the third asking of the bans,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He started; and perceiving smiles around<br/>
Broadening to grins, he colour'd more than once,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hastily&mdash;as nothing can confound<br/>
A wise man more than laughter from a dunce&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflicted on the dish a deadly wound,<br/>
And with such hurry, that ere he could curb it<br/>
He had paid his neighbour's prayer with half a turbot.

</p>
<p>
This was no bad mistake, as it occurr'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The supplicator being an amateur;<br/>
But others, who were left with scarce a third,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were angry&mdash;as they well might, to be sure.<br/>
They wonder'd how a young man so absurd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Henry at his table should endure;<br/>
And this, and his not knowing how much oats<br/>
Had fallen last market, cost his host three votes.

</p>
<p>
They little knew, or might have sympathised,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he the night before had seen a ghost,<br/>
A prologue which but slightly harmonised<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the substantial company engross'd<br/>
By matter, and so much materialised,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That one scarce knew at what to marvel most<br/>
Of two things&mdash;how (the question rather odd is)<br/>
Such bodies could have souls, or souls such bodies.

</p>
<p>
But what confused him more than smile or stare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the 'squires and 'squiresses around,<br/>
Who wonder'd at the abstraction of his air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially as he had been renown'd<br/>
For some vivacity among the fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the country circle's narrow bound<br/>
(For little things upon my lord's estate<br/>
Were good small talk for others still less great)&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Was, that he caught Aurora's eye on his,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And something like a smile upon her cheek.<br/>
Now this he really rather took amiss:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In those who rarely smile, their smiles bespeak<br/>
A strong external motive; and in this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile of Aurora's there was nought to pique<br/>
Or hope, or love, with any of the wiles<br/>
Which some pretend to trace in ladies' smiles.

</p>
<p>
'T was a mere quiet smile of contemplation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indicative of some surprise and pity;<br/>
And Juan grew carnation with vexation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was not very wise, and still less witty,<br/>
Since he had gain'd at least her observation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A most important outwork of the city&mdash;<br/>
As Juan should have known, had not his senses<br/>
By last night's ghost been driven from their defences.

</p>
<p>
But what was bad, she did not blush in turn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor seem embarrass'd&mdash;quite the contrary;<br/>
Her aspect was as usual, still&mdash;not stern&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,<br/>
Yet grew a little pale&mdash;with what? concern?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not; but her colour ne'er was high&mdash;<br/>
Though sometimes faintly flush'd&mdash;and always clear,<br/>
As deep seas in a sunny atmosphere.

</p>
<p>
But Adeline was occupied by fame<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This day; and watching, witching, condescending<br/>
To the consumers of fish, fowl, and game,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dignity with courtesy so blending,<br/>
As all must blend whose part it is to aim<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Especially as the sixth year is ending)<br/>
At their lord's, son's, or similar connection's<br/>
Safe conduct through the rocks of re-elections.

</p>
<p>
Though this was most expedient on the whole,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And usual<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Juan, when he cast a glance<br/>
On Adeline while playing her grand role,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which she went through as though it were a dance,<br/>
Betraying only now and then her soul<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By a look scarce perceptibly askance<br/>
(Of weariness or scorn), began to feel<br/>
Some doubt how much of Adeline was real;

</p>
<p>
So well she acted all and every part<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By turns&mdash;with that vivacious versatility,<br/>
Which many people take for want of heart.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They err&mdash;'t is merely what is call'd mobility,<br/>
A thing of temperament and not of art,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though seeming so, from its supposed facility;<br/>
And false&mdash;though true; for surely they 're sincerest<br/>
Who are strongly acted on by what is nearest.

</p>
<p>
This makes your actors, artists, and romancers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroes sometimes, though seldom&mdash;sages never;<br/>
But speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Little that 's great, but much of what is clever;<br/>
Most orators, but very few financiers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though all Exchequer chancellors endeavour,<br/>
Of late years, to dispense with Cocker's rigours,<br/>
And grow quite figurative with their figures.

</p>
<p>
The poets of arithmetic are they<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, though they prove not two and two to be<br/>
Five, as they might do in a modest way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have plainly made it out that four are three,<br/>
Judging by what they take, and what they pay.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sinking Fund's unfathomable sea,<br/>
That most unliquidating liquid, leaves<br/>
The debt unsunk, yet sinks all it receives.

</p>
<p>
While Adeline dispensed her airs and graces,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair Fitz-Fulke seem'd very much at ease;<br/>
Though too well bred to quiz men to their faces,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize<br/>
The ridicules of people in all places&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That honey of your fashionable bees&mdash;<br/>
And store it up for mischievous enjoyment;<br/>
And this at present was her kind employment.

</p>
<p>
However, the day closed, as days must close;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening also waned&mdash;and coffee came.<br/>
Each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,<br/>
Retired: with most unfashionable bows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their docile esquires also did the same,<br/>
Delighted with their dinner and their host,<br/>
But with the Lady Adeline the most.

</p>
<p>
Some praised her beauty; others her great grace;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity<br/>
Was obvious in each feature of her face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity.<br/>
Yes; she was truly worthy her high place!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No one could envy her deserved prosperity.<br/>
And then her dress&mdash;what beautiful simplicity<br/>
Draperied her form with curious felicity!

</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Sweet Adeline deserved their praises,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By an impartial indemnification<br/>
For all her past exertion and soft phrases,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a most edifying conversation,<br/>
Which turn'd upon their late guests' miens and faces,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And families, even to the last relation;<br/>
Their hideous wives, their horrid selves and dresses,<br/>
And truculent distortion of their tresses.

</p>
<p>
True, she said little&mdash;'t was the rest that broke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth into universal epigram;<br/>
But then 't was to the purpose what she spoke:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Addison's 'faint praise,' so wont to damn,<br/>
Her own but served to set off every joke,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As music chimes in with a melodrame.<br/>
How sweet the task to shield an absent friend!<br/>
I ask but this of mine, to&mdash;not defend.

</p>
<p>
There were but two exceptions to this keen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Skirmish of wits o'er the departed; one<br/>
Aurora, with her pure and placid mien;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Juan, too, in general behind none<br/>
In gay remark on what he had heard or seen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sate silent now, his usual spirits gone:<br/>
In vain he heard the others rail or rally,<br/>
He would not join them in a single sally.

</p>
<p>
'T is true he saw Aurora look as though<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She approved his silence; she perhaps mistook<br/>
Its motive for that charity we owe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But seldom pay the absent, nor would look<br/>
Farther&mdash;it might or might not be so.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Juan, sitting silent in his nook,<br/>
Observing little in his reverie,<br/>
Yet saw this much, which he was glad to see.

</p>
<p>
The ghost at least had done him this much good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In making him as silent as a ghost,<br/>
If in the circumstances which ensued<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He gain'd esteem where it was worth the most.<br/>
And certainly Aurora had renew'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In him some feelings he had lately lost,<br/>
Or harden'd; feelings which, perhaps ideal,<br/>
Are so divine, that I must deem them real:&mdash;

</p>
<p>
The love of higher things and better days;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance<br/>
Of what is call'd the world, and the world's ways;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The moments when we gather from a glance<br/>
More joy than from all future pride or praise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which kindle manhood, but can ne'er entrance<br/>
The heart in an existence of its own,<br/>
Of which another's bosom is the zone.

</p>
<p>
Who would not sigh Ai ai Tan Kuuerheian<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That hath a memory, or that had a heart?<br/>
Alas! her star must fade like that of Dian:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray fades on ray, as years on years depart.<br/>
Anacreon only had the soul to tie an<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwithering myrtle round the unblunted dart<br/>
Of Eros: but though thou hast play'd us many tricks,<br/>
Still we respect thee, 'Alma Venus Genetrix!'

</p>
<p>
And full of sentiments, sublime as billows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaving between this world and worlds beyond,<br/>
Don Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrived, retired to his; but to despond<br/>
Rather than rest. Instead of poppies, willows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved o'er his couch; he meditated, fond<br/>
Of those sweet bitter thoughts which banish sleep,<br/>
And make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep.

</p>
<p>
The night was as before: he was undrest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving his night-gown, which is an undress;<br/>
Completely 'sans culotte,' and without vest;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, he hardly could be clothed with less:<br/>
But apprehensive of his spectral guest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He sate with feelings awkward to express<br/>
(By those who have not had such visitations),<br/>
Expectant of the ghost's fresh operations.

</p>
<p>
And not in vain he listen'd;<br/>
&mdash;Hush! what 's that?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I see&mdash;I see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Ah, no!&mdash;'t is not&mdash;yet 't is&mdash;<br/>
Ye powers! it is the&mdash;the&mdash;the<br/>
&mdash;Pooh! the cat!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil may take that stealthy pace of his!<br/>
So like a spiritual pit-a-pat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or tiptoe of an amatory Miss,<br/>
Gliding the first time to a rendezvous,<br/>
And dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.

</p>
<p>
Again&mdash;what is 't? The wind? No, no&mdash;this time<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the sable friar as before,<br/>
With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or (as rhymes may be in these days) much more.<br/>
Again through shadows of the night sublime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When deep sleep fell on men, and the world wore<br/>
The starry darkness round her like a girdle<br/>
Spangled with gems&mdash;the monk made his blood curdle.

</p>
<p>
A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,<br/>
Like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounding like very supernatural water,<br/>
Came over Juan's ear, which throbb'd, alas!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For immaterialism 's a serious matter;<br/>
So that even those whose faith is the most great<br/>
In souls immortal, shun them tete-a-tete.

</p>
<p>
Were his eyes open?<br/>
&mdash;Yes! and his mouth too.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprise has this effect&mdash;to make one dumb,<br/>
Yet leave the gate which eloquence slips through<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As wide as if a long speech were to come.<br/>
Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tremendous to a mortal tympanum:<br/>
His eyes were open, and (as was before<br/>
Stated) his mouth. What open'd next?&mdash;the door.

</p>
<p>
It open'd with a most infernal creak,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like that of hell. 'Lasciate ogni speranza<br/>
Voi che entrate!' The hinge seem'd to speak,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreadful as Dante's rhima, or this stanza;<br/>
Or&mdash;but all words upon such themes are weak:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A single shade 's sufficient to entrance<br/>
Hero&mdash;for what is substance to a spirit?<br/>
Or how is 't matter trembles to come near it?

</p>
<p>
The door flew wide,&mdash;not swiftly, but, as fly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea-gulls, with a steady, sober flight,<br/>
And then swung back, nor close, but stood awry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Half letting in long shadows on the light,<br/>
Which still in Juan's candlesticks burned high,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he had two, both tolerably bright,<br/>
And in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood<br/>
The sable Friar in his solemn hood.

</p>
<p>
Between two worlds life hovers like a star,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt night and morn, upon the horizon's verge.<br/>
How little do we know that which we are!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How less what we may be! The eternal surge<br/>
Of time and tide rolls on, and bears afar<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge,<br/>
Lash'd from the foam of ages; while the graves<br/>
Of empires heave but like some passing waves.

</p>
<p>
Don Juan shook, as erst he had been shaken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The night before, but being sick of shaking,<br/>
He first inclined to think he had been mistaken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then to be ashamed of such mistaking.<br/>
His own internal ghost began to awaken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within him and to quell his corporal quaking,<br/>
Hinting that soul and body on the whole<br/>
Were odds against a disembodied soul.

</p>
<p>
And then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he arose, advanced. The shade retreated,<br/>
But Juan, eager now the truth to pierce,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed, his veins no longer cold, but heated,<br/>
Resolved to thrust the mystery carte and tierce,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At whatsoever risk of being defeated.<br/>
The ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until<br/>
He reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.

</p>
<p>
Juan put forth one arm. Eternal powers!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It touched no soul nor body, but the wall,<br/>
On which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Checkered with all the tracery of the hall.<br/>
He shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When he can't tell what 'tis that doth appal.<br/>
How odd, a single hobgoblin's nonentity<br/>
Should cause more fear than a whole host's identity.

</p>
<p>
But still the shade remained, the blue eyes glared,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And rather variably for stony death.<br/>
Yet one thing rather good the grave had spared;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost had a remarkably sweet breath.<br/>
A straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A red lip with two rows of pearls beneath<br/>
Gleamed forth, as through the casement's ivy shroud<br/>
The moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud.

</p>
<p>
And Juan, puzzled but still curious, thrust<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His other arm forth. Wonder upon wonder!<br/>
It pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,<br/>
&nbsp;Which beat as if there was a warm heart under.<br/>
He found, as people on most trials must,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he had made at first a silly blunder<br/>
And that in his confusion he had caught<br/>
Only the wall, instead of what he sought

</p>
<p>
The ghost, if ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As ever lurked beneath a holy hood.<br/>
A dimpled chin, a neck of ivory stole<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth into something much like flesh and blood.<br/>
Back fell the sable frock and dreary cowl<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they revealed, alas, that ere they should,<br/>
In full, voluptuous, but not o'ergrown bulk,<br/>
The phantom of her frolic Grace<br/>
&mdash;Fitz-Fulke!
