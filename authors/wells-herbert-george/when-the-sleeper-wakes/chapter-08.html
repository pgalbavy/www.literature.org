<P>
As the fans in the circular aperture of the inner room
rotated and permitted glimpses of the night, dim
sounds drifted in thereby. And Graham, standing
underneath, wrestling darkly with the unknown powers 
that imprisoned him, and which he had now deliberately 
challenged, was startled by the sound of a
voice.
<P>
He peered up and saw in the intervals of the rotation, 
dark and dim, the face and shoulders of a man
regarding him. When a dark hand was extended, the
swift van struck it, swung round and beat on with a
little brownish patch on the edge of its thin blade, and
something began to fall therefrom upon the floor,
dripping silently.
  Graham looked down, and there were spots of blood
at his feet. He looked up again in a strange excitement. 
The figure had gone.
<P>
He remained motionless--his every sense intent
upon the flickering patch of darkness, for outside it
was high night. He became aware of some faint, remote, 
dark specks floating lightly through the outer
air. They came down towards him, fitfully, eddyingly, 
and passed aside out of the uprush from the
fan. A gleam of light flickered, the specks flashed
white, and then the darkness came again. Warmed
and lit as he was, he perceived that it was snowing
within a few feet of him.
<P>
Graham walked across the room and came back
to the ventilator again. He saw the head of a man
pass near. There was a sound of whispering. Then
a smart blow on some metallic substance, effort,
voices, and the vans stopped. A gust of snowflakes
whirled into the room, and vanished before they
touched the floor. "Don't be afraid," said a voice.
<P>
Graham stood under the van. "Who are you?"
he whispered.
<P>
For a moment there was nothing but a swaying of the
fan, and then the head of a man was thrust cautiously
into the opening. His face appeared nearly inverted
to Graham; his dark hair was wet with dissolving
flakes of snow upon it. His arm went up into the
darkness holding something unseen. He had a youthful 
face and bright eyes, and the veins of his forehead
were swollen. He seemed to be exerting himself to
maintain his position.
<P>
For several seconds neither he nor Graham spoke.
<P>
"You were the Sleeper?" said the stranger at last.
<P>
"Yes," said Graham. "What do you want with
me?"
<P>
"I come from Ostrog, Sire."
<P>
"Ostrog?"
<P>
The man in the ventilator twisted his head round
so that his profile was towards Graham. He appeared
to be listening. Suddenly there was a hasty exclamation, 
and the intruder sprang back just in time to
escape the sweep of the released fan. And when 
Graham peered up there was nothing visible but the
slowly falling snow.
<P>
It was perhaps a quarter of an hour before anything
returned to the ventilator. But at last came the same
metallic interference again; the fans stopped and the
face reappeared. Graham had remained all this time
in the same place, alert and tremulously excited.
<P>
"Who are you? What do you want?" he said.
<P>
"We want to speak to you, Sire," said the intruder.
<P>
"We want--I can't hold the thing. We have been
trying to find a way to you these three days."
<P>
"Is it rescue? " whispered Graham. " Escape?"
<P>
"Yes, Sire. If you will."
<P>
"You are my party--the party of the Sleeper?"
<P>
"Yes, Sire."
<P>
"What am I to do?" said Graham.
<P>
There was a struggle. The stranger's arm appeared,
and his hand was bleeding. His knees came into view
over the edge of the funnel. "Stand away from me,"
he said, and he dropped rather heavily on his hands
and one shoulder at Graham's feet. The released
ventilator whirled noisily. The stranger rolled over,
sprang up nimbly and stood panting, hand to a bruised
shoulder, and with his bright eyes on Graham.
<P>
"You are indeed the Sleeper," he said. "I saw
you asleep. When it was the law that anyone might
see you."
<P>
"I am the man who was in the trance," said Graham. 
"They have imprisoned me here. I have been
here since I awoke--at least three days."
<P>
The intruder seemed about to speak, heard something, 
glanced swiftly at the door, and suddenly left
Graham and ran towards it, shouting quick incoherent
words. A bright wedge of steel flashed in his hand,
and he began tap, tap, a quick succession of blows
upon the hinges. "Mind!" cried a voice. "Oh!"
The voice came from above.
<P>
Graham glanced up, saw the soles of two feet,
ducked, was struck on the shoulder by one of them,
and a heavy weight bore him to the earth. He fell on
his knees and forward, and the weight went over his
head. He knelt up and saw a second man from above
seated before him.
<P>
"I did not see you, Sire," panted the man. He rose
and assisted Graham to arise. "Are you hurt, Sire?"
he panted. A succession of heavy blows on the ventilator 
began, something fell close to Graham's face,
and a shivering edge of white metal danced, fell over,
and lay flat upon the floor.
<P>
"What is this?" cried Graham, confused and looking 
at the ventilator. "Who are you? What are you
going to do? Remember, I understand nothing."
<P>
"Stand back," said the stranger, and drew him
from under the ventilator as another fragment of metal
fell heavily.
<P>
" We want you to come, Sire," panted the newcomer, 
and Graham glancing at his face again, saw
a new cut had changed from white to red on his fore-
head, and a couple of little trickles of blood starting
therefrom. "Your people call for you."
<P>
"Come where? My people? "
<P>
"To the hall about the markets. Your life is in
danger here. We have spies. We learned but just
in time. The Council has decided--this very day--
either to drug or kill you. And everything is ready.
The people are drilled, the wind-vane police, the engineers, 
and half the way-gearers are with us. We have
the halls crowded--shouting. The whole city shouts
against the Council. We have arms." He wiped the
blood with his hand. "Your life here is not worth--"
"But why arms? "
<P>
"The people have risen to protect you, Sire.
What? "
<P>
He turned quickly as the man who had first come
down made a hissing with his teeth. Graham saw
the latter start back, gesticulate to them to conceal
themselves, and move as if to hide behind the opening
door.
<P>
As he did so Howard appeared, a little tray in one
hand and his heavy face downcast. He started, looked
up, the door slammed behind him, the tray tilted side-
ways, and the steel wedge struck him behind the ear.
He went down like a felled tree, and lay as he fell
athwart the floor of the outer room. The man who
had struck him bent hastily, studied his face for a
moment, rose, and returned to his work at the door.
<P>
"Your poison!" said a voice in Graham's ear.
<P>
Then abruptly they were in darkness. The innumerable 
cornice lights had been extinguished. Graham saw
the aperture of the ventilator with ghostly
snow whirling above it and dark figures moving hastily. 
Three knelt on the van. Some dim thing--a
ladder was being lowered through the opening, and
a hand appeared holding a fitful yellow light.
<P>
He had a moment of hesitation. But the manner
of these men, their swift alacrity, their words, marched
so completely with his own fears of the Council, with
his idea and hope of a rescue, that it lasted not a
moment. And his people awaited him!
<P>
"I do not understand," he said, "I trust. Tell me
what to do."
<P>
The man with the cut brow gripped Graham's arm.
<P>
"Clamber up the ladder," he whispered. "Quick.
They will have heard--"
<P>
Graham felt for the ladder with extended hands, put
his foot on the lower rung, and, turning his head, saw
over the shoulder of the nearest man, in the yellow
flicker of the light, the first-comer astride over Howard 
and still working at the door. Graham turned to
the ladder again, and was thrust by his conductor and
helped up by those above, and then he was standing
on something hard and cold and slippery outside the
ventilating funnel.
<P>
He shivered. He was aware of a great difference
in the temperature. Half a dozen men stood about
him, and light flakes of snow touched hands and face
and melted. For a moment it was dark, then for a
flash a ghastly violet white, and then everything was
dark again.
<P>
He saw he had come out upon the roof of the vast
city structure which had replaced the miscellaneous
houses, streets and open spaces of Victorian London.
The place upon which he stood was level, with huge
serpentine cables Iying athwart it in every direction.
The circular wheels of a number of windmills loomed
indistinct and gigantic through the darkness and snowfall, 
and roared with a varying loudness as the fitful
white light smote up from below, touched the snow
eddies with a transient glitter, and made an evanescent
spectre in the night; and here and there, low down!
some vaguely outlined wind-driven mechanism flickered 
with livid sparks.
<P>
All this he appreciated in a fragmentary manner as
his rescuers stood about him. Someone threw a thick
soft cloak of fur-like texture about him, and fastened
it by buckled straps at waist and shoulders. Things
were said briefly, decisively. Someone thrust him
forward.
<P>
Before his mind was yet clear a dark shape gripped
his arm. "This way," said this shape, urging him
along, and pointed Graham across the flat roof in the
direction of a dim semicircular haze of light. Graham
obeyed.
<P>
"Mind!" said a voice, as Graham stumbled against
a cable. "Between them and not across them," said
the voice. And, "We must hurry."
<P>
"Where are the people? " said Graham. "The
people you said awaited me? "
<P>
The stranger did not answer. He left Graham's
arm as the path grew narrower, and led the way with
rapid strides. Graham followed blindly. In a minute 
he found himself running. "Are the others coming?" 
he panted, but received no reply. His companion 
glanced back and ran on. They came to a sort
of pathway of open metal-work, transverse to the direction 
they had come, and they turned aside to follow
this. Graham looked back, but the snowstorm had
hidden the others.
<P>
"Come on!" said his guide. Running now, they
drew near a little windmill spinning high in the air.
"Stoop," said Graham's guide, and they avoided an
endless band running roaring up to the shaft of the
vane. "This way!" and they were ankle deep in a
gutter full of drifted thawing snow, between two low
walls of metal that presently rose waist high. "I will
go first," said the guide. Graham drew his cloak
about him and followed. Then suddenly came a narrow 
abyss across which the gutter leapt to the snowy
darkness of the further side. Graham peeped over the
side once and the gulf was black. For a moment he
regretted his flight. He dared not look again, and his
brain spun as he waded through the half liquid snow.
<P>
Then out of the gutter they clambered and hurried
across a wide flat space damp with thawing snow,
and for half its extent dimly translucent to lights that
went to and fro underneath. He hesitated at this
unstable looking substance, but his guide ran on
unheeding, and so they came to and clambered up
slippery steps to the rim of a great dome of glass.
Round this they went. Far below a number of people
seemed to be dancing, and music filtered through the
dome. . . . Graham fancied he heard a shouting
through the snowstorm, and his guide hurried him on
with a new spurt of haste. They clambered panting to
a space of huge windmills, one so vast that only the
lower edge of its vans came rushing into sight and
rushed up again and was lost in the night and the
snow. They hurried for a time through the colossal
metallic tracery of its supports, and came at last above
a place of moving platforms like the place into which
Graham had looked from the balcony. They crawled
across the sloping transparency that covered this street
of platforms, crawling on hands and knees because of
the slipperiness of the snowfall.
<P>
For the most part the glass was bedewed, and Graham 
saw only hazy suggestions of the forms below,
but near the pitch of the transparent roof the glass was
clear, and he found himself looking sheerly down upon
it all. For awhile, in spite of the urgency of his
guide, he gave way to vertigo and lay spread-eagled
on the glass, sick and paralysed. Far below, mere
stirring specks and dots, went the people of the unsleeping 
city in their perpetual daylight, and the moving 
platforms ran on their incessant journey. Messengers 
and men on unknown businesses shot along
the drooping cables and the frail bridges were crowded
with men. It was like peering into a gigantic glass
hive, and it lay vertically below him with only a tough
glass of unknown thickness to save him from a fall.
The street showed warm and lit, and Graham was wet
now to the skin with thawing snow, and his feet were
numbed with cold. For a space he could not move.
<P>
"Come on!" cried his guide, with terror in his voice.
"Come on!"
<P>
Graham reached the pitch of the roof by an effort.
<P>
Over the ridge, following his guide's example, he
turned about and slid backward down the opposite
slope very swiftly, amid a little avalanche of snow
While he was sliding he thought of what would happen
if some broken gap should come in his way. At the
edge he stumbled to his feet ankle deep in slush
thanking heaven for an opaque footing again. His
guide was already clambering up a metal screen to a
level expanse.
<P>
Through the spare snowflakes above this loomed
another line of vast windmills, and then suddenly the
amorphous tumult of the rotating wheels was pierced
with a deafening sound. It was a mechanical shrilling
of extraordinary intensity that seemed to come simultaneously 
from every point of the compass.
<P>
"They have missed us already!" cried Graham's
guide in an accent of terror, and suddenly, with a
blinding flash, the night became day.
<P>
Above the driving snow, from the summits of the
wind-wheels, appeared vast masts carrying globes of
livid light. They receded in illimitable vistas in every
direction. As far as his eye could penetrate the snowfall 
they glared.
<P>
"Get on this," cried Graham's conductor, and
thrust him forward to a long grating of snowless 
metal that ran like a band between two slightly
sloping expanses of snow. It felt warm to Graham's
benurrled feet, and a faint eddy of steam rose from it.
<P>
"Come on!" shouted his guide ten yards off, and,
without waiting, ran swiftly through the incandescent
glare towards the iron supports of the next range of
wind-wheels. Graham, recovering from his astonishment, 
followed as fast, convinced of his imminent
capture.
<P>
In a score of seconds they were within a tracery of
glare and black shadows shot with moving bars
beneath the monstrous wheels. Graham's conductor
ran on for some time, and suddenly darted sideways
and vanished into a black shadow in the corner of the
foot of a huge support. In another moment Graham
was beside him.
<P>
They cowered panting and stared out.
<P>
The scene upon which Graham looked was very
wild and strange. The snow had now almost ceased;
only a belated flake passed now and again across the
picture. But the broad stretch of level before them
was a ghastly white, broken only by gigantic masses
and moving shapes and lengthy strips of impenetrable
darkness, vast ungainly Titans of shadow. All about
them, huge metallic structures, iron girders, inhumanly 
vast as it seemed to him, interlaced, and the
edges of wind-wheels, scarcely moving in the lull, I
passed in great shining curves steeper and steeper up
into a luminous haze. Wherever the snow-spangled
light struck down, beams and girders, and incessant
bands running with a halting, indomitable resolution
passed upward and downward into the black. And
with all that mighty activity, with an omnipresent
sense of motive and design, this snow-clad desolation
of mechanism seemed void of all human presence save
themselves, seemed as trackless and deserted and
unfrequented by men as some inaccessible Alpine
snowfield.
<P>
"They will be chasing us," cried the leader. "We
are scarcely halfway there yet. Cold as it is we must
hide here for a space--at least until it snows more
thickly again."
<P>
His teeth chattered in his head.
<P>
"Where are the markets? " asked Graham staring
out. "Where are all the people? "
<P>
The other made no answer.
<P>
<P>
"Look!" whispered Graham, crouched close, and
became very still.
<P>
The snow had suddenly become thick again, and
sliding with the whirling eddies out of the black pit
of the sky came something, vague and large and very
swift. It came down in a steep curve and swept round,
wide wings extended and a trail of white condensing
steam behind it, rose with an easy swiftness and went
gliding up the air, swept horizontally forward in a
wide curve, and vanished again in the steaming specks
of snow. And, through the ribs of its body, Graham
saw two little men, very minute and active, searching
the snowy areas about him, as it seemed to him, with
field glasses. For a second they were clear, then hazy
through a thick whirl of snow, then small and distant,
and in a minute they were gone.
<P>
"Now!" cried his companion. "Come!"
<P>
He pulled Graham's sleeve, and incontinently the
two were running headlong down the arcade of ironwork 
beneath the wind-wheels. Graham, running
blindly, collided with his leader, who had turned back
on him suddenly. He found himself within a dozen
yards of a black chasm. It extended as far as he
could see right and left. It seemed to cut off their
progress in either direction.
<P>
"Do as I do," whispered his guide. He lay down
and crawled to the edge, thrust his head over and
twisted until one leg hung. He seemed to feel for
something with his foot, found it, and went sliding
over the edge into the gulf. His head reappeared.
"It is a ledge," he whispered. "In the dark all the
way along. Do as I did."
<P>
Graham hesitated, went down upon all fours,
crawled to the edge, and peered into a velvety blackness. 
For a sickly moment he had courage neither
to go on nor retreat, then he sat and hung his leg
down, felt his guide's hands pulling at him, had a
horrible sensation of sliding over the edge into the
unfathomable, splashed, and felt himself in a slushy
gutter, impenetrably dark.
<P>
"This way," whispered the voice, and he began
crawling along the gutter through the trickling thaw,
pressing himself against the wall. They continued
along it for some minutes. He seemed to pass through
a hundred stages of misery, to pass minute after minute
through a hundred degrees of cold, damp, and exhaustion. 
In a little while he ceased to feel his hands and
feet.
<P>
The gutter sloped downwards. He observed that
they were now many feet below the edge of the buildings. 
Rows of spectral white shapes like the ghosts
of blind-drawn windows rose above them. They came
to the end of a cable fastened above one of these white
windows, dimly visible and dropping into impenetrable
shadows. Suddenly his hand came against his guide's.
<P>
"Still!" whispered the latter very softly.
<P>
He looked up with a start and saw the huge wings
of the flying machine gliding slowly and noiselessly
overhead athwart the broad band of snow-flecked grey-blue 
sky. In a moment it was hidden again.
<P>
"Keep still; they were just turning."
<P>
For awhile both were motionless, then Graham's
companion stood up, and reaching towards the fastenings 
of the cable fumbled with some indistinct tackle.
<P>
"What is that? " asked Graham.
<P>
The only answer was a faint cry. The man crouched
motionless. Graham peered and saw his face dimly.
He was staring down the long ribbon of sky, and
Graham, following his eyes, saw the flying machine
small and faint and remote. Then he saw that the
wings spread on either side, that it headed towards
them, that every moment it grew larger. It was following 
the edge of the chasm towards them.
<P>
The man's movements became convulsive. He
thrust two cross bars into Graham's hand. Graham
could not see them, he ascertained their form by feeling. 
They were slung by thin cords to the cable. On
the cord were hand grips of some soft elastic substance. 
"Put the cross between your legs," whispered 
the guide hysterically, "and grip the holdfasts.
Grip tightly, grip!"
<P>
Graham did as he was told.
<P>
"Jump," said the voice. "In heaven's name,
jump!"
<P>
For one momentous second Graham could not
speak. He was glad afterwards that darkness hid his
face. He said nothing. He began to tremble violently. 
He looked sideways at the swift shadow that
swallowed up the sky as it rushed upon him.
<P>
"Jump! Jump--in God's name! Or they will have
us," cried Graham's guide, and in the violence of his
passion thrust him forward.
<P>
Graham tottered convulsively, gave a sobbing cry,
a cry in spite of himself, and then, as the flying
machine swept over them, fell forward into the pit of
that darkness, seated on the cross wood and holding
the ropes with the clutch of death. Something
cracked, something rapped smartly against a wall.
He heard the pulley of the cradle hum on its rope.
He heard the aeronauts shout. He felt a pair of knees
digging into his back.... He was sweeping
headlong through the air, falling through the air. All
his strength was in his hands. He would have
screamed but he had no breath.
<P>
He shot into a blinding light that made him grip
the tighter. He recognised the great passage with
the running ways, the hanging lights and interlacing
girders. They rushed upward and by him. He had
a momentary impression of a great circular aperture
yawning to swallow him up.
<P>
He was in the dark again, falling, falling, gripping
with aching hands, and behold! a clap of sound, a
burst of light, and he was in a brightly lit hall with a
roaring multitude of people beneath his feet. The
people! His people! A proscenium, a stage rushed
up towards him, and his cable swept down to a circular 
aperture to the right of this. He felt he was travelling 
slower, and suddenly very much slower. He
distinguished shouts of "Saved! The Master. He is
safe!" The stage rushed up towards him with rapidly 
diminishing swiftness. Then--.
<P>
He heard the man clinging behind him shout as if
suddenly terrified, and this shout was echoed by a
shout from below. He felt that he was no longer
gliding along the cable but falling with it. There was
a tumult of yells, screams and cries. He felt something 
soft against his extended hand, and the impact
of a broken fall quivering through his arm. . .
<P>
He wanted to be still and the people were lifting
him. He believed afterwards he was carried to the 
platform and given some drink, but he was never sure.
He did  not notice what became of his guide. When
his mind was clear again he was on his feet; eager
hands were assisting him to stand. He was in a 
big alcove, occupying the position that in his previous
experience had been devoted to the lower boxes. If 
this was indeed a theatre.
<P>
A mighty tumult was in his ears, a thunderous roar,
the shouting of a countless multitude." It is the
Sleeper! The Sleeper is with us!"
<P>
"The Sleeper is with us! The Master--the
Owner! The Master is with us. He is safe."
<P>
Graham had a surging vision of a great hall crowded
with people. He saw no individuals, he was conscious
of a froth of pink faces, of waving arms and garments,
he felt the occult influence of a vast crowd pouring
over him, buoying him up. There were balconies,
galleries, great archways giving remoter perspectives,
and everywhere people, a vast arena of people, densely
packed and cheering. Across the nearer space lay
the collapsed cable like a huge snake. It had been
cut by the men of the flying machine at its upper end,
and had crumpled down into the hall. Men seemed
to be hauling this out of the way. But the whole
effect was vague, the very buildings throbbed and
leapt with the roar of the voices.
<P>
He stood unsteadily and looked at those about him.
Someone supported him by one arm. "Let me go
into a little room," he said, weeping; "a little room,"
and could say no more. A man in black stepped forward, 
took his disengaged arm. He was aware of
officious men opening a door before him. Someone
guided him to a seat. He staggered. He sat down
heavily and covered his face with his hands; he was
trembling violently, his nervous control was at an end.
He was relieved of his cloak, he could not remember
how; his purple hose he saw were black with wet.
People were running about him, things were happening, 
but for some time he gave no heed to them.
<P>
He had escaped. A myriad of cries told him that.
He was safe. These were the people who were on his
side. For a space he sobbed for breath, and then he
sat still with his face covered. The air was full of
the shouting of innumerable men.
