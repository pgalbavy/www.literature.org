THE tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall, had got 
down to my native place and its neighbourhood, before I got there. 
I found the Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found 
that it made a great change in the Boar's demeanour. Whereas the 
Boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when 
I was coming into property, the Boar was exceedingly cool on the 
subject now that I was going out of property. 

<p>It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I 
had so often made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my 
usual bedroom, which was engaged (probably by some one who 
had expectations), and could only assign me a very indifferent 
chamber among the pigeons and post-chaises up the yard. But, 
I had as sound asleep in that lodging as in the most superior 
accommodation the Boar could have given me, and the quality of 
my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom. 

<p>Early in the morning while my breakfast was getting ready, I 
strolled round by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate, 
and on bits of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a 
sale by auction of the Household Furniture and Effects, next week. 
The House itself was to be sold as old building materials and pulled 
down. LOT was marked in whitewashed knock-knee letters on 
the brew house; LOT on that part of the main building which had 
been so long shut up. Other lots were marked off on other parts 
of the structure, and the ivy had been torn down to make room for 
the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in the dust and was 
withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open gate and 
looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who 
had no business there, I saw the auctioneer's clerk walking on the 
casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue com- 
piler, pen in hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair 
I had so often pushed along to the tune of Old Clem. 

<p>When I got back to my breakfust in the Boar's coffee-room, I 
found Mr Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr Pumble- 
chook (not improved in appearance by his late nocturnal adven- 
ture) was waiting for me, and addressed me in the following terms. 

<p>`Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else 
could be expected! What else could be expected!' 

<p>As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and 
as I was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it. 

<p>`William,' said Mr Pumblechook to the waiter, `put a muffin on 
table. And has it come to this! Has it come to this!' 

<p>I frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr Pumblechook stood 
over me and poured out my tea -- before I could touch the teapot -- 
with the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the 
last. 

<p>`William,' said Mr Pumblechook, mournfully, `put the salt on. 
In happier times,' addressing me, `I think you took sugar. And did 
you take milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a water- 
cress.' 

<p>`Thank you,' said I, shortly, `but I don't eat watercresses.' 

<p>`You don't eat 'em,' returned Mr Pumblechook, sighing and 
nodding his head several times, as if he might have expected that, 
and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my 
downfall. `True. The simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn't 
bring any, William.' 

<p>I went on with my breakfast, and Mr Pumblechook continued 
to stand over me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always 
did. 

<p>`Little more than skin and bone!' mused Mr Pumblechook, 
aloud. `And yet when he went away from here (I may say with my 
blessing), and I spread afore him my humble store, like the Bee, he 
was as plump as a Peach!' 

<p>This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile 
manner in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, 
saying, `May I? ' and the ostentatious clemency with which he had 
just now exhibited the same fat five fingers. 

<p>`Hah!' he went on, handing me the bread-and-butter. `And air 
you a going to Joseph?' 

<p>`In Heaven's name,' said I, firing in spite of myself, `what does it 
matter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.' 

<p>It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave 
Pumblechook the opportunity he wanted. 

<p>`Yes, young man,' said he, releasing the handle of the article in 
question, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the 
behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, `I <I>will</I> leave that tea- 
pot alone. You are right, young man. For once, you are right. I for- 
git myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to wish 
your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality, 
to be stimilated by the 'olesome nourishment of your forefathers. 
And yet,' said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and waiter, 
and pointing me out at arm's length, `this is him as I ever sported 
with in his days of happy infancyl Tell me not it cannot be; I tell 
you this is him!' 

<p>A low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be 
particularly affected. 

<p>`This is him,' said Pumblechook, `as I have rode in my shay- 
cart. This is him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him 
untoe the sister of which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was 
Georgiana M'ria from her own mother, let him deny it if he can!' 

<p>The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it 
gave the case a black look. 

<p>`Young man,' said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the 
old fashion, `you air a going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, 
you ask me, where you air a going? I say to you, Sir, you air a go- 
ing to Joseph.' 

<p>The waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over 
that. 

<p>`Now,' said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating 
air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing 
and conclusive, `I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is 
Squires of the Boar present, known and respected in this town, and 
here is William, which his father's name was Potkins if I do not 
deceive myself.' 

<p>`You do not, sir,' said William. 

<p>`In their presence,' pursued Pumblechook, `I will tell you, 
young man, what to say to Joseph. Says you, ``Joseph, I have this 
day seen my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun's. I 
will name no names, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him 
up-town, and I have seen that man.''' 

<p>`I swear I don't see him here,' said I. 

<p>`Say that likewise,' retorted Pumblechook. `Say you said that, 
and even Joseph will probably betray surprise.' 

<p>`There you quite mistake him,' said I. `I know better.' 

<p>`Says you,' Pumblechook went on, ```Joseph, I have seen that 
man, and that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. 
He knows your character, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your 
pig-headedness and ignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, 
and he knows my want of gratitoode. Yes, Joseph,'' says you,' here 
Pumblechook shook his head and hand at me, ```he knows my total 
deficiency of common human gratitoode. <I>He</I> knows it, Joseph, as 
none can. <I>You</I> do not know it, Joseph, having no call to know it, 
but that man do.''' 

<p>Windy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have 
the face to talk thus to mine. 

<p>`Says you, ``Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will 
now repeat. It was, that in my being brought low, he saw the finger 
of Providence. He knowed that finger when he saw it, Joseph, and 
he saw it plain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. <I>Reward of in-</I>
<I>gratitoode to his earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun's.</I> But that 
man said that he did not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not 
at all. It was right to do it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to 
do it, and he would do it again.''' 

<p>`It's a pity,' said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted 
breakfast, `that the man did not say what he had done and would 
do again.' 

<p>`Squires of the Boar!' Pumblechook was now addressing the 
landlord, `and William! I have no objections to your mentioning, 
either up-town or down-town, if such should be your wishes, that 
it was right to do it, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I 
would do it again.' 

<p>With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, 
with an air, and left the house; leaving me much more astonished 
than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite `it.' I was not 
long after him in leaving the house too, and when I went down the 
High-street I saw him holding forth (no doubt to the same effect) 
at his shop door to a select group, who honoured me with very 
unfavourable glances as I passed on the opposite side of the 
way. 

<p>But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose 
great forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be, 
contrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, 
for my limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I 
drew nearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruth- 
fulness further and further behind. 

<p>The June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks 
were soaring high over the green corn, I thought all that country- 
side more beautiful and peaceful by fur than I had ever known it to 
be yet. Many pleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, 
and of the change for the better that would come over my character 
when I had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple fuith and clear 
home-wisdom I had proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a 
tender emotion in me; for, my heart was softened by my return, 
and such a change had come to pass, that I felt like one who was 
toiling home barefoot from distant travel, and whose wanderings 
had lasted many years. 

<p>The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress, I had never seen; 
but, the little roundabout lane by which I entered the village for 
quietness' sake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the 
day was a holiday; no children were there, and Biddy's house was 
closed. Some hopeful notion of seeing her busily engaged in her 
daily duties, before she saw me, had been in my mind and was 
defeated. 

<p>But, the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards 
it under the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe's ham- 
mer. Long after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had 
fancied I heard it and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes 
were there, and the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees 
were there, and their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped 
to listen; but, the clink of Joe's hammer was not in the midsummer 
wind. 

<p>Almost tearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the 
forge, I saw it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, 
no glittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and 
still. 

<p>But, the house was not deserted, and the best parlour seemed to 
be in use, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, 
and the window was open and gay with flowers. I went softly to- 
wards it, meaning to peep over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy 
stood before me, arm in arm. 

<p>At first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, 
but in another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, 
and she wept to see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; 
she, because I looked so worn and white. 

<p>`But dear Biddy, how smart you are!' 

<p>`Yes, dear Pip.' 

<p>`And Joe, how smart <I>you</I> are!' 

<p>`Yes, dear old Pip, old chap.' 

<p>I looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then -- 

<p>`It's my wedding-day,' cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, `and 
I am married to Joe!' 

<p>They had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down 
on the old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and 
Joe's restoring touch was on my shoulder. `Which he warn't strong 
enough, my dear, fur to be surprised,' said Joe. And Biddy said, `I 
ought to have thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.' They 
were both so overjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched 
by my coming to them, so delighted that I should have come by 
accident to make their day complete! 

<p>My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never 
breathed this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with 
me in my illness, had it risen to my lips. How irrevocable would 
have been his knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but 
another hour! 

<p>`Dear Biddy,' said I, `you have the best husband in the whole 
world, and if you could have seen him by my bed you would 
have -- But no, you couldn't love him better than you do.' 

<p>`No, I couldn't indeed,' said Biddy. 

<p>`And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and 
she will make you as happy as even you deserwe to be, you dear, 
good, noble Joel 

<p>Joe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve 
before his eyes. 

<p>`And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, 
and are in charity and love with all mankind, receive my humble 
thanks for all you have done for me and all I have so ill repaid! 
And when I say that I am going away within the hour, for I am 
soon going abroad, and that I shall never rest until I have worked 
for the money with which you have kept me out of prison, and have 
sent it to you, don't think, dear Joe and Biddy, that if I could repay 
it a thousand times over, I suppose I could cancel a furthing of the 
debt I owe you, or that I would do so if I could!' 

<p>They were both melted by these words, and both entreated me 
to say no more. 

<p>`But I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children 
to love, and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney corner of 
a winter night, who may remind you of another little fellow gone 
out of it for ever. Don't tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don't tell 
him, Biddy, that I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I 
honoured you both, because you were both so good and true, and 
that, as your child, I said it would be natural to him to grow up a 
much better man than I did.' 

<p>`I ain't a going,' said Joe, from behind his sleeve, `to tell him 
nothink o' that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain't. Nor yet no one 
ain't. 

<p>`And now, though I know you have already done it in your own 
kind hearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive mel Pray let me 
hear you say the words, that I may carry the sound of them away 
with me, and then I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, 
and think better of me, in the time to come!' 

<p>`O dear old Pip, old chap,' said Joe. `God knows as I forgive 
you, if I have anythink to forgive!' 

<p>`Amen! And God knows I do!' echoed Biddy. 

<p>`Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there 
a few minutes by myself, and then when I have eaten and drunk 
with you, go with me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, 
before we say good-bye!' 

<p>I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composi- 
tion with my creditors -- who gave me ample time to pay them in 
full -- and I went out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had 
quitted England, and within two months I was clerk to Clarriker 
and Co., and within four months I assumed my first undivided re- 
sponsibility. For, the beam across the parlour ceiling at Mill Pond 
Bank, had then ceased to tremble under old Bill Barley's growls and 
was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to marry Clara, and I was 
left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until he brought her back. 

<p>Many a year went round, before I was a partner in the House; 
but, I lived happily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, 
and paid my debts, and maintained a constant correspondence with 
Biddy and Joe. It was not until I became third in the Firm, that 
Clarriker betrayed me to Herbert; but, he then declared that the 
secret of Herbert's partnership had been long enough upon his con- 
science, and he must tell it. So, he told it, and Herbert was as much 
moved as amazed, and the dear fellow and I were not the worse 
friends for the long concealment. I must not leave it to be supposed 
that we were ever a great House, or that we made mints of money. 
We were not in a grand way of business, but we had a good name, 
and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so much 
to Herbert's ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often won- 
dered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I 
was one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inapti- 
tude had never been in him at all, but had been in me.
