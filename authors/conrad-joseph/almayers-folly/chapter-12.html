<p>"That is the place," said Dain, indicating with the blade of
his paddle a small islet about a mile ahead of the canoe&mdash;"that
is the place where Babalatchi promised that a boat from the prau
would come for me when the sun is overhead.  We will wait for
that boat there."</p>

<p>Almayer, who was steering, nodded without speaking, and by a
slight sweep of his paddle laid the head of the canoe in the required
direction.</p>

<p>They were just leaving the southern outlet of the Pantai, which
lay behind them in a straight and long vista of water shining
between two walls of thick verdure that ran downwards and towards
each other, till at last they joined and sank together in the
far-away distance.  The sun, rising above the calm waters of the
Straits, marked its own path by a streak of light that glided
upon the sea and darted up the wide reach of the river, a hurried
messenger of light and life to the gloomy forests of the coast;
and in this radiance of the sun's pathway floated the black canoe
heading for the islet which lay bathed in sunshine, the yellow
sands of its encircling beach shining like an inlaid golden disc
on the polished steel of the unwrinkled sea.  To the north and
south of it rose other islets, joyous in their brilliant colouring
of green and yellow, and on the main coast the sombre line of
mangrove bushes ended to the southward in the reddish cliffs of
Tanjong Mirrah, advancing into the sea, steep and shadowless under
the clear, light of the early morning.</p>

<p>The bottom of the canoe grated upon the sand as the little craft
ran upon the beach.  Ali leaped on shore and held on while Dain
stepped out carrying Nina in his arms, exhausted by the events
and the long travelling during the night.  Almayer was the last
to leave the boat, and together with Ali ran it higher up on the
beach.  Then Ali, tired out by the long paddling, laid down in
the shade of the canoe, and incontinently fell asleep.  Almayer
sat sideways on the gunwale, and with his arms crossed on his
breast, looked to the southward upon the sea.</p>

<p>After carefully laying Nina down in the shade of the bushes growing
in the middle of the islet, Dain threw himself beside her and
watched in silent concern the tears that ran down from under her
closed eyelids, and lost themselves in that fine sand upon which
they both were lying face to face.  These tears and this sorrow
were for him a profound and disquieting mystery.  Now, when the
danger was past, why should she grieve?  He doubted her love no
more than he would have doubted the fact of his own existence,
but as he lay looking ardently in her face, watching her tears,
her parted lips, her very breath, he was uneasily conscious of
something in her he could not understand.  Doubtless she had the
wisdom of perfect beings.  He sighed.  He felt something invisible
that stood between them, something that would let him approach
her so far, but no farther.  No desire, no longing, no effort
of will or length of life could destroy this vague feeling of
their difference.  With awe but also with great pride he concluded
that it was her own incomparable perfection.  She was his, and
yet she was like a woman from another world.  His!  His!  He exulted
in the glorious thought; nevertheless her tears pained him.</p>

<p>With a wisp of her own hair which he took in his hand with timid
reverence he tried in an access of clumsy tenderness to dry the
tears that trembled on her eyelashes.  He had his reward in a
fleeting smile that brightened her face for the short fraction
of a second, but soon the tears fell faster than ever, and he
could bear it no more.  He rose and walked towards Almayer, who
still sat absorbed in his contemplation of the sea.  It was a
very, very long time since he had seen the sea&mdash;that sea that
leads everywhere, brings everything, and takes away so much. 
He had almost forgotten why he was there, and dreamily he could
see all his past life on the smooth and boundless surface that
glittered before his eyes.</p>

<p>Dain's hand laid on Almayer's shoulder recalled him with a start
from some country very far away indeed.  He turned round, but
his eyes seemed to look rather at the place where Dain stood than
at the man himself. Dain felt uneasy under the unconscious gaze.</p>

<p>"What?" said Almayer.</p>

<p>"She is crying," murmured Dain, softly.</p>

<p>"She is crying!  Why?" asked Almayer, indifferently.</p>

<p>"I came to ask you.  My Ranee smiles when looking at the man
she loves. It is the white woman that is crying now.  You would
know."</p>

<p>Almayer shrugged his shoulders and turned away again towards
the sea.</p>

<p>"Go, Tuan Putih," urged Dain.  "Go to her; her tears are more
terrible to me than the anger of gods."</p>

<p>"Are they?  You will see them more than once.  She told me she
could not live without you," answered Almayer, speaking without
the faintest spark of expression in his face, "so it behoves you
to go to her quick, for fear you may find her dead."</p>

<p>He burst into a loud and unpleasant laugh which made Dain stare
at him with some apprehension, but got off the gunwale of the
boat and moved slowly towards Nina, glancing up at the sun as
he walked.</p>

<p>"And you go when the sun is overhead?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Tuan.  Then we go," answered Dain.</p>

<p>"I have not long to wait," muttered Almayer.  "It is most important
for me to see you go.  Both of you.  Most important," he repeated,
stopping short and looking at Dain fixedly.</p>

<p>He went on again towards Nina, and Dain remained behind.  Almayer
approached his daughter and stood for a time looking down on her. 
She did not open her eyes, but hearing footsteps near her, murmured
in a low sob, "Dain."</p>

<p>Almayer hesitated for a minute and then sank on the sand by her
side. She, not hearing a responsive word, not feeling a touch,
opened her eyes&mdash;saw her father, and sat up suddenly with a movement
of terror.</p>

<p>"Oh, father!" she murmured faintly, and in that word there was
expressed regret and fear and dawning hope.</p>

<p>"I shall never forgive you, Nina," said Almayer, in a dispassionate
voice.  "You have torn my heart from me while I dreamt of your
happiness. You have deceived me.  Your eyes that for me were like
truth itself lied to me in every glance&mdash;for how long?  You know
that best.  When you were caressing my cheek you were counting
the minutes to the sunset that was the signal for your meeting
with that man&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>He ceased, and they both sat silent side by side, not looking
at each other, but gazing at the vast expanse of the sea.  Almayer's
words had dried Nina's tears, and her look grew hard as she stared
before her into the limitless sheet of blue that shone limpid,
unwaving, and steady like heaven itself.  He looked at it also,
but his features had lost all expression, and life in his eyes
seemed to have gone out.  The face was a blank, without a sign
of emotion, feeling, reason, or even knowledge of itself.  All
passion, regret, grief, hope, or anger&mdash;all were gone, erased
by the hand of fate, as if after this last stroke everything was
over and there was no need for any record.</p>

<p>Those few who saw Almayer during the short period of his remaining
days were always impressed by the sight of that face that seemed
to know nothing of what went on within: like the blank wall of
a prison enclosing sin, regrets, and pain, and wasted life, in
the cold indifference of mortar and stones.</p>

<p>"What is there to forgive?" asked Nina, not addressing Almayer
directly, but more as if arguing with herself.  "Can I not live
my own life as you have lived yours?  The path you would have
wished me to follow has been closed to me by no fault of mine."</p>

<p>"You never told me," muttered Almayer.</p>

<p>"You never asked me," she answered, "and I thought you were like
the others and did not care.  I bore the memory of my humiliation
alone, and why should I tell you that it came to me because I
am your daughter?  I knew you could not avenge me."</p>

<p>"And yet I was thinking of that only," interrupted Almayer, "and
I wanted to give you years of happiness for the short day of your
suffering.  I only knew of one way."</p>

<p>"Ah! but it was not my way!" she replied.  "Could you give me
happiness without life?  Life!" she repeated with sudden energy
that sent the word ringing over the sea.  "Life that means power
and love," she added in a low voice.</p>

<p>"That!" said Almayer, pointing his finger at Dain standing close
by and looking at them in curious wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes, that!" she replied, looking her father full in the face
and noticing for the first time with a slight gasp of fear the
unnatural rigidity of his features.</p>

<p>"I would have rather strangled you with my own hands," said Almayer,
in an expressionless voice which was such a contrast to the desperate
bitterness of his feelings that it surprised even himself.  He
asked himself who spoke, and, after looking slowly round as if
expecting to see somebody, turned again his eyes towards the sea.</p>

<p>"You say that because you do not understand the meaning of my
words," she said sadly.  "Between you and my mother there never
was any love.  When I returned to Sambir I found the place which
I thought would be a peaceful refuge for my heart, filled with
weariness and hatred&mdash;and mutual contempt.  I have listened to
your voice and to her voice.  Then I saw that you could not understand
me; for was I not part of that woman?  Of her who was the regret
and shame of your life?  I had to choose &mdash;I hesitated. 
Why were you so blind?  Did you not see me struggling before your
eyes?  But, when he came, all doubt disappeared, and I saw only
the light of the blue and cloudless heaven&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will tell you the rest," interrupted Almayer:  "when that
man came I also saw the blue and the sunshine of the sky.  A thunderbolt
has fallen from that sky, and suddenly all is still and dark around
me for ever.  I will never forgive you, Nina; and to-morrow I
shall forget you!  I shall never forgive you," he repeated with
mechanical obstinacy while she sat, her head bowed down as if
afraid to look at her father.</p>

<p>To him it seemed of the utmost importance that he should assure
her of his intention of never forgiving.  He was convinced that
his faith in her had been the foundation of his hopes, the motive
of his courage, of his determination to live and struggle, and
to be victorious for her sake. And now his faith was gone, destroyed
by her own hands; destroyed cruelly, treacherously, in the dark;
in the very moment of success.  In the utter wreck of his affections
and of all his feelings, in the chaotic disorder of his thoughts,
above the confused sensation of physical pain that wrapped him
up in a sting as of a whiplash curling round him from his shoulders
down to his feet, only one idea remained clear and definite&mdash;not
to forgive her; only one vivid desire&mdash;to forget her.  And this
must be made clear to her&mdash;and to himself&mdash;by frequent repetition.
That was his idea of his duty to himself&mdash;to his race&mdash;to his
respectable connections; to the whole universe unsettled and shaken
by this frightful catastrophe of his life.  He saw it clearly
and believed he was a strong man.  He had always prided himself
upon his unflinching firmness.  And yet he was afraid.  She had
been all in all to him.  What if he should let the memory of his
love for her weaken the sense of his dignity?  She was a remarkable
woman; he could see that; all the latent greatness of his nature&mdash;in
which he honestly believed&mdash;had been transfused into that slight,
girlish figure.  Great things could be done!  What if he should
suddenly take her to his heart, forget his shame, and pain, and
anger, and&mdash;follow her!  What if he changed his heart if not his
skin and made her life easier between the two loves that would
guard her from any mischance!  His heart yearned for her.  What
if he should say that his love for her was greater than . . .</p>

<p>"I will never forgive you, Nina!" he shouted, leaping up madly
in the sudden fear of his dream.</p>

<p>This was the last time in his life that he was heard to raise
his voice. Henceforth he spoke always in a monotonous whisper
like an instrument of which all the strings but one are broken
in a last ringing clamour under a heavy blow.</p>

<p>She rose to her feet and looked at him.  The very violence of
his cry soothed her in an intuitive conviction of his love, and
she hugged to her breast the lamentable remnants of that affection
with the unscrupulous greediness of women who cling desperately
to the very scraps and rags of love, any kind of love, as a thing
that of right belongs to them and is the very breath of their
life.  She put both her hands on Almayer's shoulders, and looking
at him half tenderly, half playfully, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You speak so because you love me."</p>

<p>Almayer shook his head.</p>

<p>"Yes, you do," she insisted softly; then after a short pause
she added, "and you will never forget me."</p>

<p>Almayer shivered slightly.  She could not have said a more cruel
thing.</p>

<p>"Here is the boat coming now," said Dain, his arm outstretched
towards a black speck on the water between the coast and the islet.</p>

<p>They all looked at it and remained standing in silence till the
little canoe came gently on the beach and a man landed and walked
towards them. He stopped some distance off and hesitated.</p>

<p>"What news?" asked Dain.</p>

<p>"We have had orders secretly and in the night to take off from
this islet a man and a woman.  I see the woman.  Which of you
is the man?"</p>

<p>"Come, delight of my eyes," said Dain to Nina.  "Now we go, and
your voice shall be for my ears only.  You have spoken your last
words to the Tuan Putih, your father.  Come."</p>

<p>She hesitated for a while, looking at Almayer, who kept his eyes
steadily on the sea, then she touched his forehead in a lingering
kiss, and a tear&mdash;one of her tears&mdash;fell on his cheek and ran
down his immovable face.</p>

<p>"Goodbye," she whispered, and remained irresolute till he pushed
her suddenly into Dain's arms.</p>

<p>"If you have any pity for me," murmured Almayer, as if repeating
some sentence learned by heart, "take that woman away."</p>

<p>He stood very straight, his shoulders thrown back, his head held
high, and looked at them as they went down the beach to the canoe,
walking enlaced in each other's arms.  He looked at the line of
their footsteps marked in the sand.  He followed their figures
moving in the crude blaze of the vertical sun, in that light violent
and vibrating, like a triumphal flourish of brazen trumpets. 
He looked at the man's brown shoulders, at the red sarong round
his waist; at the tall, slender, dazzling white figure he supported. 
He looked at the white dress, at the falling masses of the long
black hair.  He looked at them embarking, and at the canoe growing
smaller in the distance, with rage, despair, and regret in his
heart, and on his face a peace as that of a carved image of oblivion. 
Inwardly he felt himself torn to pieces, but Ali&mdash;who now aroused&mdash;stood
close to his master, saw on his features the blank expression
of those who live in that hopeless calm which sightless eyes only
can give.</p>

<p>The canoe disappeared, and Almayer stood motionless with his
eyes fixed on its wake.  Ali from under the shade of his hand
examined the coast curiously.  As the sun declined, the sea-breeze
sprang up from the northward and shivered with its breath the
glassy surface of the water.</p>

<p>"Dapat!" exclaimed Ali, joyously.  "Got him, master!  Got prau! 
Not there!  Look more Tanah Mirrah side.  Aha!  That way!  Master,
see?  Now plain.  See?"</p>

<p>Almayer followed Ali's forefinger with his eyes for a long time
in vain. At last he sighted a triangular patch of yellow light
on the red background of the cliffs of Tanjong Mirrah.  It was
the sail of the prau that had caught the sunlight and stood out,
distinct with its gay tint, on the dark red of the cape.  The
yellow triangle crept slowly from cliff to cliff, till it cleared
the last point of land and shone brilliantly for a fleeting minute
on the blue of the open sea.  Then the prau bore up to the southward:
the light went out of the sail, and all at once the vessel itself
disappeared, vanishing in the shadow of the steep headland that
looked on, patient and lonely, watching over the empty sea.</p>

<p>Almayer never moved.  Round the little islet the air was full
of the talk of the rippling water.  The crested wavelets ran up
the beach audaciously, joyously, with the lightness of young life,
and died quickly, unresistingly, and graciously, in the wide curves
of transparent foam on the yellow sand.  Above, the white clouds
sailed rapidly southwards as if intent upon overtaking something. 
Ali seemed anxious.</p>

<p>"Master," he said timidly, "time to get house now.  Long way
off to pull. All ready, sir."</p>

<p>"Wait," whispered Almayer.</p>

<p>Now she was gone his business was to forget, and he had a strange
notion that it should be done systematically and in order.  To
Ali's great dismay he fell on his hands and knees, and, creeping
along the sand, erased carefully with his hand all traces of Nina's
footsteps.  He piled up small heaps of sand, leaving behind him
a line of miniature graves right down to the water.  After burying
the last slight imprint of Nina's slipper he stood up, and, turning
his face towards the headland where he had last seen the prau,
he made an effort to shout out loud again his firm resolve to
never forgive.  Ali watching him uneasily saw only his lips move,
but heard no sound.  He brought his foot down with a stamp.  He
was a firm man&mdash;firm as a rock.  Let her go.  He never had a daughter. 
He would forget.  He was forgetting already.</p>

<p>Ali approached him again, insisting on immediate departure, and
this time he consented, and they went together towards their canoe,
Almayer leading.  For all his firmness he looked very dejected
and feeble as he dragged his feet slowly through the sand on the
beach; and by his side&mdash;invisible to Ali&mdash;stalked that particular
fiend whose mission it is to jog the memories of men, lest they
should forget the meaning of life. He whispered into Almayer's
ear a childish prattle of many years ago. Almayer, his head bent
on one side, seemed to listen to his invisible companion, but
his face was like the face of a man that has died struck from
behind&mdash;a face from which all feelings and all expression are
suddenly wiped off by the hand of unexpected death.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>They slept on the river that night, mooring their canoe under
the bushes and lying down in the bottom side by side, in the absolute
exhaustion that kills hunger, thirst, all feeling and all thought
in the overpowering desire for that deep sleep which is like the
temporary annihilation of the tired body.  Next day they started
again and fought doggedly with the current all the morning, till
about midday they reached the settlement and made fast their little
craft to the jetty of Lingard and Co.  Almayer walked straight
to the house, and Ali followed, paddles on shoulder, thinking
that he would like to eat something.  As they crossed the front
courtyard they noticed the abandoned look of the place. Ali looked
in at the different servants' houses: all were empty.  In the
back courtyard there was the same absence of sound and life. 
In the cooking-shed the fire was out and the black embers were
cold.  A tall, lean man came stealthily out of the banana plantation,
and went away rapidly across the open space looking at them with
big, frightened eyes over his shoulder.  Some vagabond without
a master; there were many such in the settlement, and they looked
upon Almayer as their patron.  They prowled about his premises
and picked their living there, sure that nothing worse could befall
them than a shower of curses when they got in the way of the white
man, whom they trusted and liked, and called a fool amongst themselves. 
In the house, which Almayer entered through the back verandah,
the only living thing that met his eyes was his small monkey which,
hungry and unnoticed for the last two days, began to cry and complain
in monkey language as soon as it caught sight of the familiar
face.  Almayer soothed it with a few words and ordered Ali to
bring in some bananas, then while Ali was gone to get them he
stood in the doorway of the front verandah looking at the chaos
of overturned furniture. Finally he picked up the table and sat
on it while the monkey let itself down from the roof-stick by
its chain and perched on his shoulder.  When the bananas came
they had their breakfast together; both hungry, both eating greedily
and showering the skins round them recklessly, in the trusting
silence of perfect friendship.  Ali went away, grumbling, to cook
some rice himself, for all the women about the house had disappeared;
he did not know where.  Almayer did not seem to care, and, after
he finished eating, he sat on the table swinging his legs and
staring at the river as if lost in thought.</p>

<p>After some time he got up and went to the door of a room on the
right of the verandah.  That was the office.  The office of Lingard
and Co.  He very seldom went in there.  There was no business
now, and he did not want an office.  The door was locked, and
he stood biting his lower lip, trying to think of the place where
the key could be.  Suddenly he remembered: in the women's room
hung upon a nail.  He went over to the doorway where the red curtain
hung down in motionless folds, and hesitated for a moment before
pushing it aside with his shoulder as if breaking down some solid
obstacle.  A great square of sunshine entering through the window
lay on the floor.  On the left he saw Mrs. Almayer's big wooden
chest, the lid thrown back, empty; near it the brass nails of
Nina's European trunk shone in the large initials N. A. on the
cover.  A few of Nina's dresses hung on wooden pegs, stiffened
in a look of offended dignity at their abandonment.  He remembered
making the pegs himself and noticed that they were very good pegs. 
Where was the key?  He looked round and saw it near the door where
he stood.  It was red with rust.  He felt very much annoyed at
that, and directly afterwards wondered at his own feeling.  What
did it matter?  There soon would be no key&mdash;no door&mdash;nothing! 
He paused, key in hand, and asked himself whether he knew well
what he was about.  He went out again on the verandah and stood
by the table thinking.  The monkey jumped down, and, snatching
a banana skin, absorbed itself in picking it to shreds industriously.</p>

<p>"Forget!" muttered Almayer, and that word started before him
a sequence of events, a detailed programme of things to do.  He
knew perfectly well what was to be done now.  First this, then
that, and then forgetfulness would come easy.  Very easy.  He
had a fixed idea that if he should not forget before he died he
would have to remember to all eternity.  Certain things had to
be taken out of his life, stamped out of sight, destroyed, forgotten. 
For a long time he stood in deep thought, lost in the alarming
possibilities of unconquerable memory, with the fear of death
and eternity before him.  "Eternity!" he said aloud, and the sound
of that word recalled him out of his reverie.  The monkey started,
dropped the skin, and grinned up at him amicably.</p>

<p>He went towards the office door and with some difficulty managed
to open it.  He entered in a cloud of dust that rose under his
feet.</p>

<p>Books open with torn pages bestrewed the floor; other books lay
about grimy and black, looking as if they had never been opened. 
Account books.  In those books he had intended to keep day by
day a record of his rising fortunes.  Long time ago.  A very long
time.  For many years there has been no record to keep on the
blue and red ruled pages!  In the middle of the room the big office
desk, with one of its legs broken, careened over like the hull
of a stranded ship; most of the drawers had fallen out, disclosing
heaps of paper yellow with age and dirt.  The revolving office
chair stood in its place, but he found the pivot set fast when
he tried to turn it.  No matter.  He desisted, and his eyes wandered
slowly from object to object.  All those things had cost a lot
of money at the time.  The desk, the paper, the torn books, and
the broken shelves, all under a thick coat of dust.  The very
dust and bones of a dead and gone business.  He looked at all
these things, all that was left after so many years of work, of
strife, of weariness, of discouragement, conquered so many times. 
And all for what?  He stood thinking mournfully of his past life
till he heard distinctly the clear voice of a child speaking amongst
all this wreck, ruin, and waste.  He started with a great fear
in his heart, and feverishly began to rake in the papers scattered
on the floor, broke the chair into bits, splintered the drawers
by banging them against the desk, and made a big heap of all that
rubbish in one corner of the room.</p>

<p>He came out quickly, slammed the door after him, turned the key,
and, taking it out, ran to the front rail of the verandah, and,
with a great swing of his arm, sent the key whizzing into the
river.  This done he went back slowly to the table, called the
monkey down, unhooked its chain, and induced it to remain quiet
in the breast of his jacket.  Then he sat again on the table and
looked fixedly at the door of the room he had just left.  He listened
also intently.  He heard a dry sound of rustling; sharp cracks
as of dry wood snapping; a whirr like of a bird's wings when it
rises suddenly, and then he saw a thin stream of smoke come through
the keyhole.  The monkey struggled under his coat.  Ali appeared
with his eyes starting out of his head.</p>

<p>"Master!  House burn!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Almayer stood up holding by the table.  He could hear the yells
of alarm and surprise in the settlement.  Ali wrung his hands,
lamenting aloud.</p>

<p>"Stop this noise, fool!" said Almayer, quietly.  "Pick up my
hammock and blankets and take them to the other house.  Quick,
now!"</p>

<p>The smoke burst through the crevices of the door, and Ali, with
the hammock in his arms, cleared in one bound the steps of the
verandah.</p>

<p>"It has caught well," muttered Almayer to himself.  "Be quiet,
Jack," he added, as the monkey made a frantic effort to escape
from its confinement.</p>

<p>The door split from top to bottom, and a rush of flame and smoke
drove Almayer away from the table to the front rail of the verandah. 
He held on there till a great roar overhead assured him that the
roof was ablaze. Then he ran down the steps of the verandah, coughing,
half choked with the smoke that pursued him in bluish wreaths
curling about his head.</p>

<p>On the other side of the ditch, separating Almayer's courtyard
from the settlement, a crowd of the inhabitants of Sambir looked
at the burning house of the white man.  In the calm air the flames
rushed up on high, coloured pale brick-red, with violet gleams
in the strong sunshine.  The thin column of smoke ascended straight
and unwavering till it lost itself in the clear blue of the sky,
and, in the great empty space between the two houses the interested
spectators could see the tall figure of the Tuan Putih, with bowed
head and dragging feet, walking slowly away from the fire towards
the shelter of "Almayer's Folly."</p>

<p>In that manner did Almayer move into his new house.  He took
possession of the new ruin, and in the undying folly of his heart
set himself to wait in anxiety and pain for that forgetfulness
which was so slow to come.  He had done all he could.  Every vestige
of Nina's existence had been destroyed; and now with every sunrise
he asked himself whether the longed-for oblivion would come before
sunset, whether it would come before he died?  He wanted to live
only long enough to be able to forget, and the tenacity of his
memory filled him with dread and horror of death; for should it
come before he could accomplish the purpose of his life he would
have to remember for ever!  He also longed for loneliness.  He
wanted to be alone.  But he was not.  In the dim light of the
rooms with their closed shutters, in the bright sunshine of the
verandah, wherever he went, whichever way he turned, he saw the
small figure of a little maiden with pretty olive face, with long
black hair, her little pink robe slipping off her shoulders, her
big eyes looking up at him in the tender trustfulness of a petted
child.  Ali did not see anything, but he also was aware of the
presence of a child in the house.  In his long talks by the evening
fires of the settlement he used to tell his intimate friends of
Almayer's strange doings.  His master had turned sorcerer in his
old age.  Ali said that often when Tuan Putih had retired for
the night he could hear him talking to something in his room. 
Ali thought that it was a spirit in the shape of a child.  He
knew his master spoke to a child from certain expressions and
words his master used.  His master spoke in Malay a little, but
mostly in English, which he, Ali, could understand. Master spoke
to the child at times tenderly, then he would weep over it, laugh
at it, scold it, beg of it to go away; curse it.  It was a bad
and stubborn spirit.  Ali thought his master had imprudently called
it up, and now could not get rid of it.  His master was very brave;
he was not afraid to curse this spirit in the very Presence; and
once he fought with it.  Ali had heard a great noise as of running
about inside the room and groans.  His master groaned.  Spirits
do not groan.  His master was brave, but foolish.  You cannot
hurt a spirit.  Ali expected to find his master dead next morning,
but he came out very early, looking much older than the day before,
and had no food all day.</p>

<p>So far Ali to the settlement.  To Captain Ford he was much more
communicative, for the good reason that Captain Ford had the purse
and gave orders.  On each of Ford's monthly visits to Sambir Ali
had to go on board with a report about the inhabitant of "Almayer's
Folly."  On his first visit to Sambir, after Nina's departure,
Ford had taken charge of Almayer's affairs.  They were not cumbersome. 
The shed for the storage of goods was empty, the boats had disappeared,
appropriated&mdash;generally in night-time&mdash;by various citizens of
Sambir in need of means of transport. During a great flood the
jetty of Lingard and Co. left the bank and floated down the river,
probably in search of more cheerful surroundings; even the flock
of geese&mdash;"the only geese on the east coast"&mdash;departed somewhere,
preferring the unknown dangers of the bush to the desolation of
their old home.  As time went on the grass grew over the black
patch of ground where the old house used to stand, and nothing
remained to mark the place of the dwelling that had sheltered
Almayer's young hopes, his foolish dream of splendid future, his
awakening, and his despair.</p>

<p>Ford did not often visit Almayer, for visiting Almayer was not
a pleasant task.  At first he used to respond listlessly to the
old seaman's boisterous inquiries about his health; he even made
efforts to talk, asking for news in a voice that made it perfectly
clear that no news from this world had any interest for him. 
Then gradually he became more silent&mdash;not sulkily&mdash;but as if he
was forgetting how to speak.  He used also to hide in the darkest
rooms of the house, where Ford had to seek him out guided by the
patter of the monkey galloping before him.  The monkey was always
there to receive and introduce Ford.  The little animal seemed
to have taken complete charge of its master, and whenever it wished
for his presence on the verandah it would tug perseveringly at
his jacket, till Almayer obediently came out into the sunshine,
which he seemed to dislike so much.</p>

<p>One morning Ford found him sitting on the floor of the verandah,
his back against the wall, his legs stretched stiffly out, his
arms hanging by his side.  His expressionless face, his eyes open
wide with immobile pupils, and the rigidity of his pose, made
him look like an immense man-doll broken and flung there out of
the way.  As Ford came up the steps he turned his head slowly.</p>

<p>"Ford," he murmured from the floor, "I cannot forget."</p>

<p>"Can't you?" said Ford, innocently, with an attempt at joviality:
"I wish I was like you.  I am losing my memory&mdash;age, I suppose;
only the other day my mate&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, for Almayer had got up, stumbled, and steadied himself
on his friend's arm.</p>

<p>"Hallo!  You are better to-day.  Soon be all right," said Ford,
cheerfully, but feeling rather scared.</p>

<p>Almayer let go his arm and stood very straight with his head
up and shoulders thrown back, looking stonily at the multitude
of suns shining in ripples of the river.  His jacket and his loose
trousers flapped in the breeze on his thin limbs.</p>

<p>"Let her go!" he whispered in a grating voice.  "Let her go. 
To-morrow I shall forget.  I am a firm man, . . . firm as a .
. . rock, . . . firm . . ."</p>

<p>Ford looked at his face&mdash;and fled.  The skipper was a tolerably
firm man himself&mdash;as those who had sailed with him could testify&mdash;but
Almayer's firmness was altogether too much for his fortitude.</p>

<p>Next time the steamer called in Sambir Ali came on board early
with a grievance.  He complained to Ford that Jim-Eng the Chinaman
had invaded Almayer's house, and actually had lived there for
the last month.</p>

<p>"And they both smoke," added Ali.</p>

<p>"Phew!  Opium, you mean?"</p>

<p>Ali nodded, and Ford remained thoughtful; then he muttered to
himself, "Poor devil!  The sooner the better now."  In the afternoon
he walked up to the house.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he asked of Jim-Eng, whom he found
strolling about on the verandah.</p>

<p>Jim-Eng explained in bad Malay, and speaking in that monotonous,
uninterested voice of an opium smoker pretty far gone, that his
house was old, the roof leaked, and the floor was rotten.  So,
being an old friend for many, many years, he took his money, his
opium, and two pipes, and came to live in this big house.</p>

<p>"There is plenty of room.  He smokes, and I live here.  He will
not smoke long," he concluded.</p>

<p>"Where is he now?" asked Ford.</p>

<p>"Inside.  He sleeps," answered Jim-Eng, wearily.  Ford glanced
in through the doorway.  In the dim light of the room he could
see Almayer lying on his back on the floor, his head on a wooden
pillow, the long white beard scattered over his breast, the yellow
skin of the face, the half-closed eyelids showing the whites of
the eye only. . . .</p>

<p>He shuddered and turned away.  As he was leaving he noticed a
long strip of faded red silk, with some Chinese letters on it,
which Jim-Eng had just fastened to one of the pillars.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That," said Jim-Eng, in his colourless voice, "that is the name
of the house.  All the same like my house.  Very good name."</p>

<p>Ford looked at him for awhile and went away.  He did not know
what the crazy-looking maze of the Chinese inscription on the
red silk meant.  Had he asked Jim-Eng, that patient Chinaman would
have informed him with proper pride that its meaning was: "House
of heavenly delight."</p>

<p>In the evening of the same day Babalatchi called on Captain Ford. 
The captain's cabin opened on deck, and Babalatchi sat astride
on the high step, while Ford smoked his pipe on the settee inside. 
The steamer was leaving next morning, and the old statesman came
as usual for a last chat.</p>

<p>"We had news from Bali last moon," remarked Babalatchi.  "A grandson
is born to the old Rajah, and there is great rejoicing."</p>

<p>Ford sat up interested.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Babalatchi, in answer to Ford's look.  "I told
him.  That was before he began to smoke."</p>

<p>"Well, and what?" asked Ford.</p>

<p>"I escaped with my life," said Babalatchi, with perfect gravity,
"because the white man is very weak and fell as he rushed upon
me."  Then, after a pause, he added, "She is mad with joy."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Almayer, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she lives in our Rajah's house.  She will not die soon. 
Such women live a long time," said Babalatchi, with a slight tinge
of regret in his voice.  "She has dollars, and she has buried
them, but we know where.  We had much trouble with those people. 
We had to pay a fine and listen to threats from the white men,
and now we have to be careful."  He sighed and remained silent
for a long while.  Then with energy:</p>

<p>"There will be fighting.  There is a breath of war on the islands. 
Shall I live long enough to see? . . . Ah, Tuan!" he went on,
more quietly, "the old times were best.  Even I have sailed with
Lanun men, and boarded in the night silent ships with white sails. 
That was before an English Rajah ruled in Kuching. Then we fought
amongst ourselves and were happy. Now when we fight with you we
can only die!"</p>

<p>He rose to go.  "Tuan," he said, "you remember the girl that
man Bulangi had?  Her that caused all the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ford.  "What of her?"</p>

<p>"She grew thin and could not work.  Then Bulangi, who is a thief
and a pig-eater, gave her to me for fifty dollars.  I sent her
amongst my women to grow fat.  I wanted to hear the sound of her
laughter, but she must have been bewitched, and . . . she died
two days ago.  Nay, Tuan.  Why do you speak bad words?  I am old&mdash;that
is true&mdash;but why should I not like the sight of a young face and
the sound of a young voice in my house?"  He paused, and then
added with a little mournful laugh, "I am like a white man talking
too much of what is not men's talk when they speak to one another."</p>

<p>And he went off looking very sad.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>The crowd massed in a semicircle before the steps of "Almayer's
Folly," swayed silently backwards and forwards, and opened out
before the group of white-robed and turbaned men advancing through
the grass towards the house.  Abdulla walked first, supported
by Reshid and followed by all the Arabs in Sambir.  As they entered
the lane made by the respectful throng there was a subdued murmur
of voices, where the word "Mati" was the only one distinctly audible. 
Abdulla stopped and looked round slowly.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" he asked.</p>

<p>"May you live!" answered the crowd in one shout, and then there
succeeded a breathless silence.</p>

<p>Abdulla made a few paces forward and found himself for the last
time face to face with his old enemy.  Whatever he might have
been once he was not dangerous now, lying stiff and lifeless in
the tender light of the early day.  The only white man on the
east coast was dead, and his soul, delivered from the trammels
of his earthly folly, stood now in the presence of Infinite Wisdom. 
On the upturned face there was that serene look which follows
the sudden relief from anguish and pain, and it testified silently
before the cloudless heaven that the man lying there under the
gaze of indifferent eyes had been permitted to forget before he
died.</p>

<p>Abdulla looked down sadly at this Infidel he had fought so long
and had bested so many times.  Such was the reward of the Faithful! 
Yet in the Arab's old heart there was a feeling of regret for
that thing gone out of his life.  He was leaving fast behind him
friendships, and enmities, successes, and disappointments&mdash;all
that makes up a life; and before him was only the end.  Prayer
would fill up the remainder of the days allotted to the True Believer! 
He took in his hand the beads that hung at his waist.</p>

<p>"I found him here, like this, in the morning," said Ali, in a
low and awed voice.</p>

<p>Abdulla glanced coldly once more at the serene face.</p>

<p>"Let us go," he said, addressing Reshid.</p>

<p>And as they passed through the crowd that fell back before them,
the beads in Abdulla's hand clicked, while in a solemn whisper
he breathed out piously the name of Allah!  The Merciful!  The
Compassionate!</p>
