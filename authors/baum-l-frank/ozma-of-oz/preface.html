Author's Note
<P>
My friends the children are responsible for this new "Oz Book," as
they were for the last one, which was called The Land of Oz.  Their
sweet little letters plead to know "more about Dorothy"; and they ask:
"What became of the Cowardly Lion?" and "What did Ozma do
afterward?"--meaning, of course, after she became the Ruler of Oz.
And some of them suggest plots to me, saying: "Please have Dorothy go
to the Land of Oz again"; or, "Why don't you make Ozma and Dorothy
meet, and have a good time together?"  Indeed, could I do all that my
little friends ask, I would be obliged to write dozens of books to
satisfy their demands.  And I wish I could, for I enjoy writing these
stories just as much as the children say they enjoy reading them.
<P>
Well, here is "more about Dorothy," and about our old friends the
Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and about the Cowardly Lion, and Ozma,
and all the rest of them; and here, likewise, is a good deal about
some new folks that are queer and unusual.  One little friend, who
read this story before it was printed, said to me: "Billina is REAL
OZZY, Mr. Baum, and so are Tiktok and the Hungry Tiger."
<P>
If this judgment is unbiased and correct, and the little folks find
this new story "real Ozzy," I shall be very glad indeed that I wrote
it.  But perhaps I shall get some more of those very welcome letters
from my readers, telling me just how they like "Ozma of Oz."  I hope
so, anyway.
