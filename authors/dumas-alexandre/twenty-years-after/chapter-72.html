<P>Grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and
when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from
his recumbent posture.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; he said, wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat
from his forehead, &quot;how lucky it was that Musqueton was
thirsty!&quot;</P>
<P>He made haste to pass out by the opening, still thinking
himself in a dream; but the sight of the gunpowder in the
tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare.</P>
<P>It may be imagined that D'Artagnan listened to these details
with increasing interest; before Grimaud had finished he
rose without noise and putting his mouth to Aramis's ear,
and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent
a sudden movement:</P>
<P>&quot;Chevalier,&quot; he said, &quot;get up and don't make the least
noise.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis awoke. D'Artagnan, pressing his hand, repeated his
call. Aramis obeyed.</P>
<P>&quot;Athos is near you,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;warn him as I have
warned you.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis easily aroused Athos, whose sleep was light, like
that of all persons of a finely organized constitution. But
there was more difficulty in arousing Porthos. He was
beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his
sleep, which was very annoying to him, when D'Artagnan,
instead of explaining, closed his mouth with his hand.</P>
<P>Then our Gascon, extending his arms, drew to him the heads
of his three friends till they almost touched one another.</P>
<P>&quot;Friends,&quot; he said, &quot;we must leave this craft at once or we
are dead men.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bah!&quot; said Athos, &quot;are you still afraid?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you know who is captain of this vessel?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Captain Groslow.&quot;</P>
<P>The shudder of the three musketeers showed to D'Artagnan
that his words began to make some impression on them.</P>
<P>&quot;Groslow!&quot; said Aramis; &quot;the devil!</P>
<P>&quot;Who is this Groslow?&quot; asked Porthos. &quot;I don't remember
him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Groslow is the man who broke Parry's head and is now
getting ready to break ours.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! oh!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And do you know who is his lieutenant?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;His lieutenant? There is none,&quot; said Athos. &quot;They don't
have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but Monsieur Groslow is not a captain of the ordinary
kind; he has a lieutenant, and that lieutenant is Monsieur
Mordaunt.&quot;</P>
<P>This time the musketeers did more than shudder  -  they
almost cried out. Those invincible men were subject to a
mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over
them; the mere sound of it filled them with terror.</P>
<P>&quot;What shall we do?&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;We must seize the felucca,&quot; said Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;And kill him,&quot; said Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;The felucca is mined,&quot; said D'Artagnan. &quot;Those casks which
I took for casks of port wine are filled with powder. When
Mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all,
friends and foes; and on my word he would be bad company in
going either to Heaven or to hell.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You have some plan, then?&quot; asked Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you confidence in me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Give your orders,&quot; said the three musketeers.</P>
<P>&quot;Wry well; come this way.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan went toward a very small, low window, just large
enough to let a man through. He turned it gently on its
hinges.</P>
<P>&quot;There,&quot; he said, &quot;is our road.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The deuce! it is a very cold one, my dear friend,&quot; said
Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;Stay here, if you like, but I warn you 'twill be rather too
warm presently.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But we cannot swim to the shore.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The longboat is yonder, lashed to the felucca. We will take
possession of it and cut the cable. Come, my friends.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A moment's delay,&quot; said Athos; &quot;our servants?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Here we are!&quot; they cried.</P>
<P>Meantime the three friends were standing motionless before
the awful sight which D'Artagnan, in raising the shutters,
had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the
window.</P>
<P>Those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there
is nothing more solemn, more striking, than the raging sea,
rolling, with its deafening roar, its dark billows beneath
the pale light of a wintry moon.</P>
<P>&quot;Gracious Heaven, we are hesitating!&quot; cried D'Artagnan; &quot;if
we hesitate what will the servants do?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not hesitate, you know,&quot; said Grimaud.</P>
<P>&quot;Sir,&quot; interposed Blaisois, &quot;I warn you that I can only swim
in rivers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And I not at all,&quot; said Musqueton.</P>
<P>But D'Artagnan had now slipped through the window.</P>
<P>&quot;You have decided, friend?&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; the Gascon answered; &quot;Athos! you, who are a perfect
being, bid spirit triumph over body. Do you, Aramis, order
the servants. Porthos, kill every one who stands in your
way.&quot;</P>
<P>And after pressing the hand of Athos, D'Artagnan chose a
moment when the ship rolled backward, so that he had only to
plunge into the water, which was already up to his waist.</P>
<P>Athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the
waves; the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then
seen plainly rising out of the sea.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan swam to it and held it, suspending himself by
this rope, his head alone out of water.</P>
<P>In one second Athos joined him.</P>
<P>Then they saw, as the felucca turned, two other heads
peeping, those of Aramis and Grimaud.</P>
<P>&quot;I am uneasy about Blaisois,&quot; said Athos; &quot;he can, he says,
only swim in rivers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When people can swim at all they can swim anywhere. To the
boat! to the boat!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But Porthos, I do not see him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Porthos is coming  -  he swims like Leviathan.&quot;</P>
<P>In fact, Porthos did not appear; for a scene, half tragedy
and half comedy, had been performed by him with Musqueton
and Blaisois, who, frightened by the noise of the sea, by
the whistling of the wind, by the sight of that dark water
yawning like a gulf beneath them, shrank back instead of
going forward.</P>
<P>&quot;Come, come!&quot; said Porthos; &quot;jump in.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, monsieur,&quot; said Musqueton, &quot;I can't swim; let me stay
here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And me, too, monsieur,&quot; said Blaisois.</P>
<P>&quot;I assure you, I shall be very much in the way in that
little boat,&quot; said Musqueton.</P>
<P>&quot;And I know I shall drown before reaching it,&quot; continued
Blaisois.</P>
<P>&quot;Come along! I shall strangle you both if you don't get
out,&quot; said Porthos at last, seizing Musqueton by the throat.
&quot;Forward, Blaisois!&quot;</P>
<P>A groan, stifled by the grasp of Porthos, was all the reply
of poor Blaisois, for the giant, taking him neck and heels,
plunged him into the water headforemost, pushing him out of
the window as if he had been a plank.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, Musqueton,&quot; he said, &quot;I hope you don't mean to desert
your master?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, sir,&quot; replied Musqueton, his eyes filling with tears,
&quot;why did you re-enter the army? We were all so happy in the
Chateau de Pierrefonds!&quot;</P>
<P>And without any other complaint, passive and obedient,
either from true devotion to his master or from the example
set by Blaisois, Musqueton leaped into the sea headforemost.
A sublime action, at all events, for Musqueton looked upon
himself as dead. But Porthos was not a man to abandon an old
servant, and when Musqueton rose above the water, blind as a
new-born puppy, he found he was supported by the large hand
of Porthos and that he was thus enabled, without having
occasion even to move, to advance toward the cable with the
dignity of a very triton.</P>
<P>In a few minutes Porthos had rejoined his companions, who
were already in the boat; but when, after they had all got
in, it came to his turn, there was great danger that in
putting his huge leg over the edge of the boat he would
upset the little vessel. Athos was the last to enter.</P>
<P>&quot;Are you all here?&quot; he asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! have you your sword, Athos?&quot; cried D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Cut the cable, then.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord.
The felucca went on, the boat continued stationary, rocked
only by the swashing waves.</P>
<P>&quot;Come, Athos!&quot; said D'Artagnan, giving his hand to the
count; &quot;you are going to see something curious,&quot; added the
Gascon.</P></article>
