<p>The wind was howling over the prairie, with a sharp, penetrating
power, while a few feathery flashes eddying through the air, showed
that although it was the season of spring, yet in this elevated
region of the Far West, there was scarcely the first premonition
of its breath.</p>

<p>The night was closing in, and the vast peaks of the Black Hills,
that had loomed up white and grand in the distance, were gradually
fading from view until they merged into the thickly gathering
gloom, while the blasts that whirled the snow in blinding drifts
about their tops, came moaning and sweeping over the bleak prairie,
as if searching for some one to inclose in its icy grasp, and
to strangle out of life.</p>

<p>Now and then the desolate howl of the mountain wolf, came borne
on the wind, adding to the gloomy desolation of the scene, while
the dark, swarming multitude of buffaloes hurried over the frozen
ground, as if fearful of being caught in the chilling blast. It
was a bad night to be lost upon the prairie.</p>

<p>Is there no one abroad to-night?</p>

<p>From the grove of hardy cottonwood yonder, a starlike point of
light suddenly flashes out upon the night. Surely that is the
light of some hunter’s camp-fire.</p>

<p>A party of emigrants have halted for the night, and this is the
first camp-fire that has been started, for it is not only cold,
but there is cooking to be done, and a fire is indispensable.</p>

<p>The emigrant party numbers some twenty men, a half-dozen women,
and about double that number of children. They are on their way
to Oregon, and have penetrated thus far without encountering any
obstacle worth noting, although for days they had been journeying
through the very heart of the Indian country.</p>

<p>Among the party was a man named Fred Hammond, who had joined
it more for the purpose of adventure than any thing else. He was
mounted on a magnificent black horse, was an amateur hunter, and
a general favorite with the company.</p>

<p>Among the latter was not a single experienced mountaineer or
prairie-man. They had secured the service of an old man, who professed
to be thoroughly acquainted with the overland route to Oregon,
but there was more than one who suspected his knowledge and believed
he was nothing but a fraud.</p>

<p>Extremely good fortune had attended them thus far. They had caught
sight of numerous parties of Indians, and indeed scarcely a day
passed without something being seen of them. They had exchanged
shots at quite a distance, but no harm had befallen the whites,
and they had penetrated thus far on their way to distant Oregon.</p>

<p>But Hammond and one or two of the members were filled with misgiving.
Through the day they had seen evidence of an immense Indian party
being in their vicinity, and they feared the worst. It was with
pain that they saw the huge camp-fire kindled, and Hammond called
his comrade, Beers, to one side, and said, in his earnest voice:</p>

<p>"I tell you, things look darker than ever before."</p>

<p>"So I think."</p>

<p>"I believe we are followed by over a thousand Indians, and they
intend attacking us to-night."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"God only knows; I don’t like that camp-fire."</p>

<p>"Let it burn for a short time; they don’t need it long, and then
it can be allowed to die out."</p>

<p>"But it will betray our position."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose there is any means possible by which we can conceal
it?"</p>

<p>"Not entirely, but partly."</p>

<p>As the night deepened it became of intense darkness. There was
no moon, and the sky was entirely overcast with clouds, so that
there was scarcely any light at all. The few flakes of snow that
were whirling through the air had entirely ceased, but the wind
still whistled through the grove.</p>

<p>"There is a moon up there," said Hammond, "and if the clouds
break away at all, we shall have enough light to guide us on our
way."</p>

<p>On account of the danger, which all knew threatened them, a number
proposed that as soon as their animals had had sufficient rest,
they should move out of the timber and continue their journey;
but this was finally overruled, as they were not only likely to
go astray in the darkness, but the Indians could easily find them,
from the unavoidable noise made by their wagons.</p>

<p>If attacked on the open prairie at night, they were entirely
at the mercy of their assailants, who could easily encircle and
tomahawk and shoot them all, while in the grove they could make
a fight with some prospect of success.</p>

<p>So it was prudently determined to remain where they were.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour, when there was no imperative necessity
for a fire, it was allowed to slumber and finally die out. The
wagons were placed in a rude circle, with the animals within,
while the women and children, and such men as were relieved from
duty, sought their quarters for the night, and soon silence rested
upon all.</p>

<p>A double guard was set. Ten men were scattered around the outer
edge of the globe at regular distances from each other, on the
alert for the first indications of danger.</p>

<p>Beers and Hammond stood next to each other, and the former finally
left his station and took his position beside the latter.</p>

<p>"What’s the use?" he muttered, by way of apology. "When it’s
so dark that you can’t see any thing, where’s the good of straining
your eyes? As we have got to depend on our sense of hearing, we’ll
help each other."</p>

<p>The air was so sharp and keen that they had great difficulty
in keeping themselves comfortable. They dare not stamp their feet
or swing their arms, and such movements as they made, were made
with a stealth and caution that nearly robbed them of all their
virtue.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour the sky gave some signs of clearing. It
was somewhat lighter overhead, but still the earth below was little
benefited thereby. There was scarcely any variations in the wind,
although several fancied that it had somewhat decreased.</p>

<p>Another hour passed drearily away, and then Beers suddenly laid
his hand on the arm of Hammond.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Hark!"</p>

<p>Borne to them on the wind came the distant but distinct sound
of a horse’s feet, as he galloped over the hard prairie.</p>

<p>The rapid clamp of the hoofs were heard for an instant, and then
the varying wind swept the sound away from their ears, and all
was still.</p>

<p>But in a moment they rallied out again with startling distinctness&mdash;then
grew fainter&mdash;died away and rung out once more.</p>

<p>"Some one is riding fast," said Beers.</p>

<p>"And he is coming this way," added Hammond.</p>

<p>A few minutes convinced them of the truth. A single horseman
was riding at great speed over the prairie, and was manifestly
aiming straight for the grove where the emigrants had halted for
the night.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, all the sentinels had observed it by this
time, and there was great excitement among them. They gathered
about Hammond to receive his directions.</p>

<p>"Go back to your stations," said he. "Keep your eyes and ears
open for others, whether they be mounted or afoot, and I will
attend to this one."</p>

<p>His orders were obeyed, for he was looked upon as having authority
in this matter, and with an interest difficult to understand they
awaited the coming of the horseman.</p>

<p>As the latter came nearer, he seemed to be heading straight for
the point where Hammond and Beers were standing.</p>

<p>During the last few moments, the sky had cleared so rapidly that
objects could be distinguished for quite a distance, and the two
men strained their eyes through the gloom to catch sight of the
stranger.</p>

<p>"There he is," whispered Hammond, as the dim outlines of a horse
was discovered through the darkness.</p>

<p>The horseman had reined his horse down to a walk, and was advancing
quite cautiously. He continued onward until within a dozen feet
of the two men, when he reined up.</p>

<p>"Who comes there?" asked Hammond.</p>

<p>"A friend."</p>

<p>"What do you seek?"</p>

<p>"You are in great danger, and I have come to warn you of it."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed Beers, in an undertone; "that is a
<em>woman</em>!"</p>

<p>Hammond had noticed the wondrously soft and musical voice, and
he now walked forward, so as to stand beside the horse. The dim
light showed that Beers spoke the truth; it was a woman seated
upon the horse.</p>

<p>"May I ask your name?"</p>

<p>There was a moment’s hesitation, and then the female answered:</p>

<p>"I am Lamora; and I speak the truth."</p>

<p>"We do not doubt it," responded the amazed Hammond. "What is
it you have to say?"</p>

<p>"A thousand Blackfeet warriors are coming down on this grove,
two or three hours before sunrise, and if you remain, there will
not be one who will escape alive."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Make ready as soon as possible and start westward. Let there
not be a moment’s delay, and you will be saved."</p>

<p>"But they can follow us to-morrow, (if not to-night,) and attack
us by daylight."</p>

<p>"They can, but they will not," replied Lamora, with the greatest
earnestness. "This is a great war-party on their way southward
to fight the Cheyennes. They are to meet a long ways off to-morrow;
the Blackfeet have given themselves just enough time to massacre
you and your friends, if you remain in this grove, as they expect
you will; but if they come here and do not find you, they will
have no time to follow up your wagons, and thus, you see, if you
improve your time, you will be saved."</p>

<p>"Beers," said Hammond, turning to the man beside him, "rouse
the men and have this thing done without a moment’s lost time,
while I make a few more inquiries of our unknown friend."</p>

<p>Beers darted away, and almost immediately was detected the rapid
moving to and fro, and the bustle of getting ready to start.</p>

<p>"Your orders are being obeyed," said Hammond, addressing the
lady, who still sat her horse beside him.</p>

<p>"It is well that they are," she replied, with a sigh of relief;
"the Blackfeet know that you are encamped here, and they have
no reason to think you will not be here when they are ready to
strike."</p>

<p>"Do you know where they are?"</p>

<p>"Over that ridge of hills, several miles to the northward. They
have been riding, throwing the tomahawk, and making every preparation
for the great battle which is to come off to-morrow between them
and the Cheyennes."</p>

<p>"This, then, is only a diversion?"</p>

<p>"That is it; they naturally think that, as they find you in their
way, they may as well indulge in a little preliminary practice."</p>

<p>"We were fearing an attack, as we knew that there were a large
number of Indians in our vicinity, and we heard the sound of your
horse’s feet long before we heard you. Being thus warned and prepared,
could we not have made a successful defense, with the shelter
of these trees, which you probably know are very numerous about
us?"</p>

<p>"No," was the instant answer of Lamora; "if there were no more
than a hundred Blackfeet, you might repel them; but a thousand
would overwhelm you. There are sounds of preparation upon the
part of your friends."</p>

<p>"Yes; we shall soon be on the move."</p>

<p>"Keep straight to the westward; there is now enough light to
prevent your going astray, and you will find, when daylight comes,
that Heaven has brought you out of all danger. Farewell!"</p>

<p>Ere Hammond could interpose, or even thank her, the horse had
wheeled about and was off on a gallop. Almost instantly, he vanished
in the darkness, and the rattle of his hoofs grew fainter and
fainter, until they, too, died out in the distance.</p>

<p>"<em>Lamora</em>," repeated the young man. "I surely have heard
that name pronounced by other lips than hers.</p>

<p>"Who is she? Where did she come from?</p>

<p>"She was sent by heaven, most assuredly."</p>

<p>While conversing with the girl, Hammond had approached her horse
as near as possible, and had managed to gain a distinct view of
her face. There is something in the dim, misty moonlight which
softens the asperities even of the repulsive countenance, but
he was certain that the most beautiful creature upon which he
had ever looked was conversing with him. Her half-civilized dress,
and her wealth of flowing black hair, partly assisted in her enchanting
appearance; but the face itself was one of unsurpassed loveliness.</p>

<p>The peculiar circumstances under which they encountered gave
Hammond an equally peculiar interest in her, and a pang of disappointment
went through his heart when he found that he was standing alone,
and that she had left him so abruptly.</p>

<p>But he had important matters in hand for the time, and he gave
his whole thought to them.</p>

<p>Every one was working with the energy of people who were convinced
that their lives depended upon the result. The teams were harnessed,
the wagons loaded up, and at the end of half an hour the whole
train moved out of the grove, toward the west.</p>

<p>Before starting, men had ridden out on the prairie in every direction,
and returned with the announcement that nothing could be heard
of the Blackfeet, and all pressed forward with the greatest vigor
and determination.</p>

<p>With the passing of the immediate danger, the thoughts of the
strange woman who had befriended them returned to Fred Hammond.
He felt a powerful interest in her, and, as he was riding beside
the guide of the company, he turned to him rather abruptly, and
asked:</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of Lamora?"</p>

<p>"Heard of her?" repeated the latter, in surprise; "wasn’t I telling
you all about her the other day?"</p>

<p>"So you were; I was sure I had heard her name before, but I could
not recollect from whom. Who is she?"</p>

<p>"She is a white girl, living with a tribe of Indians, somewhere
up north of us, and she has done many such things as this for
the white people crossing the plains. I have heard of her for
years as doing the same thing."</p>

<p>"What kind of a looking person is she?"</p>

<p>"Just the handsomest creature that ever lived! Wait till you
get a good look at her."</p>

<p>Hammond was not long in finding that their guide knew very little
more regarding her than he had already told, although he gossiped
and chatted about her until daylight.</p>

<p>When light at last broke over the prairie, many eyes were cast
anxiously backward, but not a sign of the Indians was visible.
The warning of Lamora had saved them!</p>

<p>Fred Hammond could not drive the thoughts of this beautiful being
from his mind, and finally he determined that, as he had joined
the company for the sake of adventure, he would turn back and
seek adventures of the most romantic kind.</p>

<p>So, on the afternoon of this day, he quietly withdrew from the
company, and started at an easy gallop in the direction that the
guide had indicated led toward the home of the mysterious and
beautiful Lamora; and, leaving our hero for a time to himself,
we must now bestow our attention upon others, who have a part
to play in this narrative. <em>Love</em>, the passion of our nature,
will play the mischief with all of us, and Fred Hammond was soon
off on this great "love-chase" of his life.</p>
