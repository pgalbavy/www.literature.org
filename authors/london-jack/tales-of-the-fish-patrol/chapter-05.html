<P>
Perhaps our most laughable exploit on the fish patrol, and at the
same time our most dangerous one, was when we rounded in, at a
single haul, an even score of wrathful fishermen.  Charley called
it a "coop," having heard Neil Partington use the term; but I think
he misunderstood the word, and thought it meant "coop," to catch,
to trap.  The fishermen, however, coup or coop, must have called it
a Waterloo, for it was the severest stroke ever dealt them by the
fish patrol, while they had invited it by open and impudent
defiance of the law.
<P>
During what is called the "open season" the fishermen might catch
as many salmon as their luck allowed and their boats could hold.
But there was one important restriction.  From sun-down Saturday
night to sun-up Monday morning, they were not permitted to set a
net.  This was a wise provision on the part of the Fish Commission,
for it was necessary to give the spawning salmon some opportunity
to ascend the river and lay their eggs.  And this law, with only an
occasional violation, had been obediently observed by the Greek
fishermen who caught salmon for the canneries and the market.
<P>
One Sunday morning, Charley received a telephone call from a friend
in Collinsville, who told him that the full force of fishermen was
out with its nets.  Charley and I jumped into our salmon boat and
started for the scene of the trouble.  With a light favoring wind
at our back we went through the Carquinez Straits, crossed Suisun
Bay, passed the Ship Island Light, and came upon the whole fleet at
work.
<P>
But first let me describe the method by which they worked.  The net
used is what is known as a gill-net.  It has a simple diamond-
shaped mesh which measures at least seven and one-half inches
between the knots.  From five to seven and even eight hundred feet
in length, these nets are only a few feet wide.  They are not
stationary, but float with the current, the upper edge supported on
the surface by floats, the lower edge sunk by means of leaden
weights,
<P>
This arrangement keeps the net upright in the current and
effectually prevents all but the smaller fish from ascending the
river.  The salmon, swimming near the surface, as is their custom,
run their heads through these meshes, and are prevented from going
on through by their larger girth of body, and from going back
because of their gills, which catch in the mesh.  It requires two
fishermen to set such a net, - one to row the boat, while the
other, standing in the stern, carefully pays out the net.  When it
is all out, stretching directly across the stream, the men make
their boat fast to one end of the net and drift along with it.
<P>
As we came upon the fleet of law-breaking fishermen, each boat two
or three hundred yards from its neighbors, and boats and nets
dotting the river as far as we could see, Charley said:
<P>
"I've only one regret, lad, and that is that I have'nt a thousand
arms so as to be able to catch them all.  As it is, we'll only be
able to catch one boat, for while we are tackling that one it will
be up nets and away with the rest."
<P>
As we drew closer, we observed none of the usual flurry and
excitement which our appearance invariably produced.  Instead, each
boat lay quietly by its net, while the fishermen favored us with
not the slightest attention.
<P>
"It's curious," Charley muttered.  "Can it be they don't recognize
us?"
<P>
I said that it was impossible, and Charley agreed; yet there was a
whole fleet, manned by men who knew us only too well, and who took
no more notice of us than if we were a hay scow or a pleasure
yacht.
<P>
This did not continue to be the case, however, for as we bore down
upon the nearest net, the men to whom it belonged detached their
boat and rowed slowly toward the shore.  The rest of the boats
showed no, sign of uneasiness.
<P>
"That's funny," was Charley's remark.  "But we can confiscate the
net, at any rate."
<P>
We lowered sail, picked up one end of the net, and began to heave
it into the boat.  But at the first heave we heard a bullet zip-
zipping past us on the water, followed by the faint report of a
rifle.  The men who had rowed ashore were shooting at us.  At the
next heave a second bullet went zipping past, perilously near.
Charley took a turn around a pin and sat down.  There were no more
shots.  But as soon as he began to heave in, the shooting
recommenced.
<P>
"That settles it," he said, flinging the end of the net overboard.
"You fellows want it worse than we do, and you can have it."
<P>
We rowed over toward the next net, for Charley was intent on
finding out whether or not we were face to face with an organized
defiance.  As we approached, the two fishermen proceeded to cast
off from their net and row ashore, while the first two rowed back
and made fast to the net we had abandoned.  And at the second net
we were greeted by rifle shots till we desisted and went on to the
third, where the manoeuvre was again repeated.
<P>
Then we gave it up, completely routed, and hoisted sail and started
on the long windward beat back to Benicia.  A number of Sundays
went by, on each of which the law was persistently violated.  Yet,
short of an armed force of soldiers, we could do nothing.  The
fishermen had hit upon a new idea and were using it for all it was
worth, while there seemed no way by which we could get the better
of them.
<P>
About this time Neil Partington happened along from the Lower Bay,
where he had been for a number of weeks.  With him was Nicholas,
the Greek boy who had helped us in our raid on the oyster pirates,
and the pair of them took a hand.  We made our arrangements
carefully.  It was planned that while Charley and I tackled the
nets, they were to be hidden ashore so as to ambush the fishermen
who landed to shoot at us.
<P>
It was a pretty plan.  Even Charley said it was.  But we reckoned
not half so well as the Greeks.  They forestalled us by ambushing
Neil and Nicholas and taking them prisoners, while, as of old,
bullets whistled about our ears when Charley and I attempted to
take possession of the nets.  When we were again beaten off, Neil
Partington and Nicholas were released.  They were rather shamefaced
when they put in an appearance, and Charley chaffed them
unmercifully.  But Neil chaffed back, demanding to know why
Charley's imagination had not long since overcome the difficulty.
<P>
"Just you wait; the idea'll come all right," Charley promised.
<P>
"Most probably," Neil agreed.  "But I'm afraid the salmon will be
exterminated first, and then there will be no need for it when it
does come."
<P>
Neil Partington, highly disgusted with his adventure, departed for
the Lower Bay, taking Nicholas with him, and Charley and I were
left to our own resources.  This meant that the Sunday fishing
would be left to itself, too, until such time as Charley's idea
happened along.  I puzzled my head a good deal to find out some way
of checkmating the Greeks, as also did Charley, and we broached a
thousand expedients which on discussion proved worthless.
<P>
The fishermen, on the other hand, were in high feather, and their
boasts went up and down the river to add to our discomfiture.
Among all classes of them we became aware of a growing
insubordination.  We were beaten, and they were losing respect for
us.  With the loss of respect, contempt began to arise.  Charley
began to be spoken of as the "olda woman," and I received my rating
as the "pee-wee kid."  The situation was fast becoming unbearable,
and we knew that we should have to deliver a stunning stroke at the
Greeks in order to regain the old-time respect in which we had
stood.
<P>
Then one morning the idea came.  We were down on Steamboat Wharf,
where the river steamers made their landings, and where we found a
group of amused long-shoremen and loafers listening to the hard-
luck tale of a sleepy-eyed young fellow in long sea-boots.  He was
a sort of amateur fisherman, he said, fishing for the local market
of Berkeley.  Now Berkeley was on the Lower Bay, thirty miles away.
On the previous night, he said, he had set his net and dozed off to
sleep in the bottom of the boat.
<P>
The next he knew it was morning, and he opened his eyes to find his
boat rubbing softly against the piles of Steamboat Wharf at
Benicia.  Also he saw the river steamer Apache lying ahead of him,
and a couple of deck-hands disentangling the shreds of his net from
the paddle-wheel.  In short, after he had gone to sleep, his
fisherman's riding light had gone out, and the Apache had run over
his net.  Though torn pretty well to pieces, the net in some way
still remained foul, and he had had a thirty-mile tow out of his
course.
<P>
Charley nudged me with his elbow.  I grasped his thought on the
instant, but objected:
<P>
"We can't charter a steamboat."
<P>
"Don't intend to," he rejoined.  "But let's run over to Turner's
Shipyard.  I've something in my mind there that may be of use to
us."
<P>
And over we went to the shipyard, where Charley led the way to the
Mary Rebecca, lying hauled out on the ways, where she was being
cleaned and overhauled.  She was a scow-schooner we both knew well,
carrying a cargo of one hundred and forty tons and a spread of
canvas greater than other schooner on the bay.
<P>
"How d'ye do, Ole," Charley greeted a big blue-shirted Swede who
was greasing the jaws of the main gaff with a piece of pork rind.
<P>
Ole grunted, puffed away at his pipe, and went on greasing.  The
captain of a bay schooner is supposed to work with his hands just
as well as the men.
<P>
Ole Ericsen verified Charley's conjecture that the Mary Rebecca, as
soon as launched, would run up the San Joaquin River nearly to
Stockton for a load of wheat.  Then Charley made his proposition,
and Ole Ericsen shook his head.
<P>
"Just a hook, one good-sized hook," Charley pleaded.
<P>
"No, Ay tank not," said Ole Ericsen.  "Der Mary Rebecca yust hang
up on efery mud-bank with that hook.  Ay don't want to lose der
Mary Rebecca.  She's all Ay got."
<P>
"No, no," Charley hurried to explain.  "We can put the end of the
hook through the bottom from the outside, and fasten it on the
inside with a nut.  After it's done its work, why, all we have to
do is to go down into the hold, unscrew the nut, and out drops the
hook.  Then drive a wooden peg into the hole, and the Mary Rebecca
will be all right again."
<P>
Ole Ericsen was obstinate for a long time; but in the end, after we
had had dinner with him, he was brought round to consent.
<P>
"Ay do it, by Yupiter!" he said, striking one huge fist into the
palm of the other hand.  "But yust hurry you up wid der hook.  Der
Mary Rebecca slides into der water to-night."
<P>
It was Saturday, and Charley had need to hurry.  We headed for the
shipyard blacksmith shop, where, under Charley's directions, a most
generously curved book of heavy steel was made.  Back we hastened
to the Mary Rebecca.  Aft of the great centre-board case, through
what was properly her keel, a hole was bored.  The end of the hook
was inserted from the outside, and Charley, on the inside, screwed
the nut on tightly.  As it stood complete, the hook projected over
a foot beneath the bottom of the schooner.  Its curve was something
like the curve of a sickle, but deeper.
<P>
In the late afternoon the Mary Rebecca was launched, and
preparations were finished for the start up-river next morning.
Charley and Ole intently studied the evening sky for signs of wind,
for without a good breeze our project was doomed to failure.  They
agreed that there were all the signs of a stiff westerly wind - not
the ordinary afternoon sea-breeze, but a half-gale, which even then
was springing up.
<P>
Next morning found their predictions verified.  The sun was shining
brightly, but something more than a half-gale was shrieking up the
Carquinez Straits, and the Mary Rebecca got under way with two
reefs in her mainsail and one in her foresail.  We found it quite
rough in the Straits and in Suisun Bay; but as the water grew more
land-locked it became calm, though without let-up in the wind.
<P>
Off Ship Island Light the reefs were shaken out, and at Charley's
suggestion a big fisherman's staysail was made all ready for
hoisting, and the maintopsail, bunched into a cap at the masthead,
was overhauled so that it could be set on an instant's notice.
<P>
We were tearing along, wing-and-wing, before the wind, foresail to
starboard and mainsail to port, as we came upon the salmon fleet.
There they were, boats and nets, as on that first Sunday when they
had bested us, strung out evenly over the river as far as we could
see.  A narrow space on the right-hand side of the channel was left
clear for steamboats, but the rest of the river was covered with
the wide-stretching nets.  The narrow space was our logical course,
but Charley, at the wheel, steered the Mary Rebecca straight for
the nets.  This did not cause any alarm among the fishermen,
because up-river sailing craft are always provided with "shoes" on
the ends of their keels, which permit them to slip over the nets
without fouling them.
<P>
"Now she takes it!" Charley cried, as we dashed across the middle
of a line of floats which marked a net.  At one end of this line
was a small barrel buoy, at the other the two fishermen in their
boat.  Buoy and boat at once began to draw together, and the
fishermen to cry out, as they were jerked after us.  A couple of
minutes later we hooked a second net, and then a third, and in this
fashion we tore straight up through the centre of the fleet.
<P>
The consternation we spread among the fishermen was tremendous.  As
fast as we hooked a net the two ends of it, buoy and boat, came
together as they dragged out astern; and so many buoys and boats,
coming together at such breakneck speed, kept the fishermen on the
jump to avoid smashing into one another.  Also, they shouted at us
like mad to heave to into the wind, for they took it as some
drunken prank on the part of scow-sailors, little dreaming that we
were the fish patrol.
<P>
The drag of a single net is very heavy, and Charley and Ole Ericsen
decided that even in such a wind ten nets were all the Mary Rebecca
could take along with her.  So when we had hooked ten nets, with
ten boats containing twenty men streaming along behind us, we
veered to the left out of the fleet and headed toward Collinsville.
<P>
We were all jubilant.  Charley was handling the wheel as though he
were steering the winning yacht home in a race.  The two sailors
who made up the crew of the Mary Rebecca, were grinning and joking.
Ole Ericsen was rubbing his huge hands in child-like glee.
<P>
"Ay tank you fish patrol fallers never ban so lucky as when you
sail with Ole Ericsen," he was saying, when a rifle cracked sharply
astern, and a bullet gouged along the newly painted cabin, glanced
on a nail, and sang shrilly onward into space.
<P>
This was too much for Ole Ericsen.  At sight of his beloved
paintwork thus defaced, he jumped up and shook his fist at the
fishermen; but a second bullet smashed into the cabin not six
inches from his head, and he dropped down to the deck under cover
of the rail.
<P>
All the fishermen had rifles, and they now opened a general
fusillade.  We were all driven to cover - even Charley, who was
compelled to desert the wheel.  Had it not been for the heavy drag
of the nets, we would inevitably have broached to at the mercy of
the enraged fishermen.  But the nets, fastened to the bottom of the
Mary Rebecca well aft, held her stern into the wind, and she
continued to plough on, though somewhat erratically.
<P>
Charley, lying on the deck, could just manage to reach the lower
spokes of the wheel; but while he could steer after a fashion, it
was very awkward.  Ole Ericsen bethought himself of a large piece
of sheet steel in the empty hold.
<P>
It was in fact a plate from the side of the New Jersey, a steamer
which had recently been wrecked outside the Golden Gate, and in the
salving of which the Mary Rebecca had taken part.
<P>
Crawling carefully along the deck, the two sailors, Ole, and myself
got the heavy plate on deck and aft, where we reared it as a shield
between the wheel and the fishermen.  The bullets whanged and
banged against it till it rang like a bull's-eye, but Charley
grinned in its shelter, and coolly went on steering.
<P>
So we raced along, behind us a howling, screaming bedlam of
wrathful Greeks, Collinsville ahead, and bullets spat-spatting all
around us.
<P>
"Ole," Charley said in a faint voice, "I don't know what we're
going to do."
<P>
Ole Ericsen, lying on his back close to the rail and grinning
upward at the sky, turned over on his side and looked at him.  "Ay
tank we go into Collinsville yust der same," he said.
<P>
"But we can't stop," Charley groaned.  "I never thought of it, but
we can't stop."
<P>
A look of consternation slowly overspread Ole Ericsen's broad face.
It was only too true.  We had a hornet's nest on our hands, and to
stop at Collinsville would be to have it about our ears.
<P>
"Every man Jack of them has a gun," one of the sailors remarked
cheerfully.
<P>
"Yes, and a knife, too," the other sailor added.
<P>
It was Ole Ericsen's turn to groan.  "What for a Svaidish faller
like me monkey with none of my biziness, I don't know," he
soliloquized.
<P>
A bullet glanced on the stern and sang off to starboard like a
spiteful bee.  "There's nothing to do but plump the Mary Rebecca
ashore and run for it," was the verdict of the first cheerful
sailor.
<P>
"And leaf der Mary Rebecca?" Ole demanded, with unspeakable horror
in his voice.
<P>
"Not unless you want to," was the response.  "But I don't want to
be within a thousand miles of her when those fellers come aboard" -
indicating the bedlam of excited Greeks towing behind.
<P>
We were right in at Collinsville then, and went foaming by within
biscuit-toss of the wharf.
<P>
"I only hope the wind holds out," Charley said, stealing a glance
at our prisoners.
<P>
"What of der wind?" Ole demanded disconsolately.  "Der river will
not hold out, and then . . . and then . . ."
<P>
"It's head for tall timber, and the Greeks take the hindermost,"
adjudged the cheerful sailor, while Ole was stuttering over what
would happen when we came to the end of the river.
<P>
We had now reached a dividing of the ways.  To the left was the
mouth of the Sacramento River, to the right the mouth of the San
Joaquin.  The cheerful sailor crept forward and jibed over the
foresail as Charley put the helm to starboard and we swerved to the
right into the San Joaquin.  The wind, from which we had been
running away on an even keel, now caught us on our beam, and the
Mary Rebecca was pressed down on her port side as if she were about
to capsize.
<P>
Still we dashed on, and still the fishermen dashed on behind.  The
value of their nets was greater than the fines they would have to
pay for violating the fish laws; so to cast off from their nets and
escape, which they could easily do, would profit them nothing.
Further, they remained by their nets instinctively, as a sailor
remains by his ship.  And still further, the desire for vengeance
was roused, and we could depend upon it that they would follow us
to the ends of the earth, if we undertook to tow them that far.
<P>
The rifle-firing had ceased, and we looked astern to see what our
prisoners were doing.  The boats were strung along at unequal
distances apart, and we saw the four nearest ones bunching
together.  This was done by the boat ahead trailing a small rope
astern to the one behind.  When this was caught, they would cast
off from their net and heave in on the line till they were brought
up to the boat in front.  So great was the speed at which we were
travelling, however, that this was very slow work.  Sometimes the
men would strain to their utmost and fail to get in an inch of the
rope; at other times they came ahead more rapidly.
<P>
When the four boats were near enough together for a man to pass
from one to another, one Greek from each of three got into the
nearest boat to us, taking his rifle with him.  This made five in
the foremost boat, and it was plain that their intention was to
board us.  This they undertook to do, by main strength and sweat,
running hand over hand the float-line of a net.  And though it was
slow, and they stopped frequently to rest, they gradually drew
nearer.
<P>
Charley smiled at their efforts, and said, "Give her the topsail,
Ole."
<P>
The cap at the mainmast head was broken out, and sheet and downhaul
pulled flat, amid a scattering rifle fire from the boats; and the
Mary Rebecca lay over and sprang ahead faster than ever.
<P>
But the Greeks were undaunted.  Unable, at the increased speed, to
draw themselves nearer by means of their hands, they rigged from
the blocks of their boat sail what sailors call a "watch-tackle."
One of them, held by the legs by his mates, would lean far over the
bow and make the tackle fast to the float-line.  Then they would
heave in on the tackle till the blocks were together, when the
manoeuvre would be repeated.
<P>
"Have to give her the staysail," Charley said.
<P>
Ole Ericsen looked at the straining Mary Rebecca and shook his
head.  "It will take der masts out of her," he said.
<P>
"And we'll be taken out of her if you don't," Charley replied.
<P>
Ole shot an anxious glance at his masts, another at the boat load
of armed Greeks, and consented.
<P>
The five men were in the bow of the boat - a bad place when a craft
is towing.  I was watching the behavior of their boat as the great
fisherman's staysail, far, far larger than the top-sail and used
only in light breezes, was broken out.  As the Mary Rebecca lurched
forward with a tremendous jerk, the nose of the boat ducked down
into the water, and the men tumbled over one another in a wild rush
into the stern to save the boat from being dragged sheer under
water.
<P>
"That settles them!" Charley remarked, though he was anxiously
studying the behavior of the Mary Rebecca, which was being driven
under far more canvas than she was rightly able to carry.
<P>
"Next stop is Antioch!" announced the cheerful sailor, after the
manner of a railway conductor.  "And next comes Merryweather!"
<P>
"Come here, quick," Charley said to me.
<P>
I crawled across the deck and stood upright beside him in the
shelter of the sheet steel.
<P>
"Feel in my inside pocket," he commanded, "and get my notebook.
That's right.  Tear out a blank page and write what I tell you."
<P>
And this is what I wrote:
<P>
<P>
Telephone to Merryweather, to the sheriff, the constable, or the
judge.  Tell them we are coming and to turn out the town.  Arm
everybody.  Have them down on the wharf to meet us or we are gone
gooses.
<P>
<P>
Now make it good and fast to that marlin-spike, and stand by to
toss it ashore."
<P>
I did as he directed.  By then we were close to Antioch.  The wind
was shouting through our rigging, the Mary Rebecca was half over on
her side and rushing ahead like an ocean greyhound.  The seafaring
folk of Antioch had seen us breaking out topsail and staysail, a
most reckless performance in such weather, and had hurried to the
wharf-ends in little groups to find out what was the matter.
<P>
Straight down the water front we boomed, Charley edging in till a
man could almost leap ashore.  When he gave the signal I tossed the
marlinspike.  It struck the planking of the wharf a resounding
smash, bounced along fifteen or twenty feet, and was pounced upon
by the amazed onlookers.
<P>
It all happened in a flash, for the next minute Antioch was behind
and we were heeling it up the San Joaquin toward Merryweather, six
miles away.  The river straightened out here into its general
easterly course, and we squared away before the wind, wing-and-wing
once more, the foresail bellying out to starboard.
<P>
Ole Ericsen seemed sunk into a state of stolid despair.  Charley
and the two sailors were looking hopeful, as they had good reason
to be.  Merryweather was a coal-mining town, and, it being Sunday,
it was reasonable to expect the men to be in town.  Further, the
coal-miners had never lost any love for the Greek fishermen, and
were pretty certain to render us hearty assistance.
<P>
We strained our eyes for a glimpse of the town, and the first sight
we caught of it gave us immense relief.  The wharves were black
with men.  As we came closer, we could see them still arriving,
stringing down the main street, guns in their hands and on the run.
Charley glanced astern at the fishermen with a look of ownership in
his eye which till then had been missing.  The Greeks were plainly
overawed by the display of armed strength and were putting their
own rifles away.
<P>
We took in topsail and staysail, dropped the main peak, and as we
got abreast of the principal wharf jibed the mainsail.  The Mary
Rebecca shot around into the wind, the captive fishermen describing
a great arc behind her, and forged ahead till she lost way, when
lines we're flung ashore and she was made fast.  This was
accomplished under a hurricane of cheers from the delighted miners.
<P>
Ole Ericsen heaved a great sigh.  "Ay never tank Ay see my wife
never again," he confessed.
<P>
"Why, we were never in any danger," said Charley.
<P>
Ole looked at him incredulously.
<P>
"Sure, I mean it," Charley went on.  "All we had to do, any time,
was to let go our end - as I am going to do now, so that those
Greeks can untangle their nets."
<P>
He went below with a monkey-wrench, unscrewed the nut, and let the
hook drop off.  When the Greeks had hauled their nets into their
boats and made everything shipshape, a posse of citizens took them
off our hands and led them away to jail.
<P>
"Ay tank Ay ban a great big fool," said Ole Ericsen.  But he
changed his mind when the admiring townspeople crowded aboard to
shake hands with him, and a couple of enterprising newspaper men
took photographs of the Mary Rebecca and her captain.
