<p>After the restraint the boys had undergone, cramped in the canoe,
and not daring to wander out of sight of their camp-fire when
upon shore, there was a delicious relief in rambling through the
woods. The clear, pure air that was dry and cool in the shadow
of the forest, the undulating, charming scenery, the novel look
that rested upon all they saw&mdash;these possessed a charm to our
young friends which they hardly could have resisted, even if they
had the will to do so; but when we say that after starting forth
scarcely a thought of their imprudence entered their heads, it
was but natural that they should find themselves led much further
away than was either wise or consistent with the resolves with
which they left their friends, Tim and Terror.</p>

<p>They took no notice of the direction they were following, nor
of the distance they had gone, until near the middle of the afternoon
Howard abruptly paused and asked, with a look of alarm:</p>

<p>"Elwood, what have we done?"</p>

<p>"Why? What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"We must be a mile off from Tim, and it will be dark before we
can get back."</p>

<p>"O! I think not. You know we have walked very slowly, and we
can hurry when we take it into our heads to return."</p>

<p>"But do you know the way?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"What course must we follow?"</p>

<p>Elwood pointed to the northwest, which, while it was not far
from their general course, was by no means the proper one by which
to rejoin their companion.</p>

<p>"How strange!" said Howard. "It seems to me that yonder is the
point from which we started."</p>

<p>And <em>he</em> pointed nearly due west, just as wrong as he
could possibly be.</p>

<p>"You are wrong," said Elwood positively. "I am sure of the right
way."</p>

<p>"We won't dispute over it," replied his companion, with some
sadness, "for it is very doubtful if either of us is right."</p>

<p>"All we have to do then, is to hunt for the river and follow
that up until we find Tim sound asleep."</p>

<p>"Yea; but how is the river to be found? To you it lies in one
place, and to me in another."</p>

<p>"But I can prove that you are wrong, and," laughed Elwood, "that
I am, too, although I was never right."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"The sun sets in the west, and notice where it is."</p>

<p>Howard now opened his eyes in amazement. He would have been sure
that it was going down in the other part of the sky; but the proof
before his eyes was irrefragable.</p>

<p>"It must be," he replied. "We have been 'turned round.' Just
as when we left the wharf at New York. I was below when the steamer
came out, and so long as New York was in sight I was sure it lay
in the wrong place."</p>

<p>"But, how bad even that makes it! We cannot reach the river before
dark, and we shall not know whether we am a mile above or below
where Tim is sleeping."</p>

<p>"If we go straight for the river, I think it likely that we shall
come much nearer him than that."</p>

<p>"It may be, but how are we to tell?"</p>

<p>"Why, if we don't find him by night, we can fire oft our guns
and call to him."</p>

<p>"And bring a party of the savages down upon us."</p>

<p>"That may be if there are any in the neighborhood, but we shall
have to run the risk."</p>

<p>By this time the boys were fully impressed with their want of
discretion and with the urgent necessity of making all haste back
to the river.</p>

<p>"Let us keep our thoughts about us," said Howard, "for we have
been without them long enough. Now, the Salinas River runs very
nearly north and south, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"This portion of it does."</p>

<p>"Then we must go as nearly east as we can, and let's be off."</p>

<p>Turning their backs upon the sun, they began retracing their
steps; but they had journeyed scarce half an hour when they found
themselves near a range of hills, which they were sure they had
not passed through, and did not remember to have seen.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" asked Howard, still more alarmed. "We
never have been near these."</p>

<p>"Are they not the hills we noticed just us we were about starting?"</p>

<p>"They cannot be;&mdash;these are larger, have not half as much wood
upon them. I tell you, Elwood, there is one thing sure."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p><em>"We are lost!"</em></p>

<p>[Illustration: "We are lost."]</p>

<p>"You are right. We may find Tim again, but we are going to have
trouble to do it."</p>

<p>"Listen! He may call to us."</p>

<p>They stopped walking find held their breath, but not a sound
broke the solemn stillness, save a faint, hollow roar&mdash;whether
the deep murmur that is always heard in a great forest, or the
sound of the distant Pacific Ocean they could not tell.</p>

<p>"No; he is asleep yet," said Elwood. "If he would only wake up
he would shout to us."</p>

<p>"Thus you see, if we shoot our guns, the chances are that <em>he</em>
will not hear it, while it may be the means of bringing to us
the very ones we are so anxious to keep away."</p>

<p>So they concluded not to fire their rifles for the present.</p>

<p>"But these hills," continued Howard, "they don't extend in any
great direction either north or south. The question now is, shall
we pass around the northern or southern end?"</p>

<p>"What difference will it make?"</p>

<p>"All the difference in the world. If Tim is to the south of us,
and we pass around that way, I think we shall find him without
much hunting, while if we take the wrong course it will be night
before we can get anywhere near him."</p>

<p>"I see," replied Elwood. "We shall have to guess at it. But,
hold!" he exclaimed, with sparkling eyes. "You go one way and
I will another!"</p>

<p>Howard shook his head.</p>

<p>"There is too much risk."</p>

<p>"Not at all. The distance is short, and we can whistle to each
other every few minutes. Then, you know, as we shall be looking
for each other, we cannot lose ourselves in these still woods.
The minute I get sight of the river I can tell whether we are
above or below Tim."</p>

<p>Howard would not consent at first, but his cousin set forth the
advantages of the plan so eloquently that he finally agreed. Arranging
their signals and manner of proceeding, the boys, therefore, separated.</p>
