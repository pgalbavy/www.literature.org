<p>
O Love! O Glory! what are ye who fly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Around us ever, rarely to alight?<br/>
There 's not a meteor in the polar sky<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such transcendent and more fleeting flight.<br/>
Chill, and chain'd to cold earth, we lift on high<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our eyes in search of either lovely light;<br/>
A thousand and a thousand colours they<br/>
Assume, then leave us on our freezing way.

</p>
<p>
And such as they are, such my present tale is,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A non-descript and ever-varying rhyme,<br/>
A versified Aurora Borealis,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which flashes o'er a waste and icy clime.<br/>
When we know what all are, we must bewail us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But ne'ertheless I hope it is no crime<br/>
To laugh at all things&mdash;for I wish to know<br/>
What, after all, are all things&mdash;but a show?

</p>
<p>
They accuse me<br/>
&mdash;Me&mdash;the present writer of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The present poem&mdash;of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I know not what&mdash;<br/>
A tendency to under-rate and scoff<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At human power and virtue, and all that;<br/>
And this they say in language rather rough.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Good God! I wonder what they would be at!<br/>
I say no more than hath been said in Dante's<br/>
Verse, and by Solomon and by Cervantes;

</p>
<p>
By Swift, by Machiavel, by Rochefoucault,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By Fenelon, by Luther, and by Plato;<br/>
By Tillotson, and Wesley, and Rousseau,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knew this life was not worth a potato.<br/>
'T is not their fault, nor mine, if this be so&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I pretend not to be Cato,<br/>
Nor even Diogenes.<br/>
&mdash;We live and die,<br/>
But which is best, you know no more than I.

</p>
<p>
Socrates said, our only knowledge was<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'To know that nothing could be known;' a pleasant<br/>
Science enough, which levels to an ass<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each man of wisdom, future, past, or present.<br/>
Newton (that proverb of the mind), alas!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Declared, with all his grand discoveries recent,<br/>
That he himself felt only 'like a youth<br/>
Picking up shells by the great ocean<br/>
&mdash;Truth.'

</p>
<p>
Ecclesiastes said, 'that all is vanity'-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Most modern preachers say the same, or show it<br/>
By their examples of true Christianity:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, all know, or very soon may know it;<br/>
And in this scene of all-confess'd inanity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By saint, by sage, by preacher, and by poet,<br/>
Must I restrain me, through the fear of strife,<br/>
From holding up the nothingness of life?

</p>
<p>
Dogs, or men!&mdash;for I flatter you in saying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ye are dogs&mdash;your betters far&mdash;ye may<br/>
Read, or read not, what I am now essaying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To show ye what ye are in every way.<br/>
As little as the moon stops for the baying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wolves, will the bright muse withdraw one ray<br/>
From out her skies&mdash;then howl your idle wrath!<br/>
While she still silvers o'er your gloomy path.

</p>
<p>
'Fierce loves and faithless wars'<br/>
&mdash;I am not sure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If this be the right reading&mdash;'t is no matter;<br/>
The fact 's about the same, I am secure;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I sing them both, and am about to batter<br/>
A town which did a famous siege endure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And was beleaguer'd both by land and water<br/>
By Souvaroff, or Anglice Suwarrow,<br/>
Who loved blood as an alderman loves marrow.

</p>
<p>
The fortress is call'd Ismail, and is placed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the Danube's left branch and left bank,<br/>
With buildings in the Oriental taste,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But still a fortress of the foremost rank,<br/>
Or was at least, unless 't is since defaced,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which with your conquerors is a common prank:<br/>
It stands some eighty versts from the high sea,<br/>
And measures round of toises thousands three.

</p>
<p>
Within the extent of this fortification<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A borough is comprised along the height<br/>
Upon the left, which from its loftier station<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Commands the city, and upon its site<br/>
A Greek had raised around this elevation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A quantity of palisades upright,<br/>
So placed as to impede the fire of those<br/>
Who held the place, and to assist the foe's.

</p>
<p>
This circumstance may serve to give a notion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the high talents of this new Vauban:<br/>
But the town ditch below was deep as ocean,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rampart higher than you 'd wish to hang:<br/>
But then there was a great want of precaution<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Prithee, excuse this engineering slang),<br/>
Nor work advanced, nor cover'd way was there,<br/>
To hint at least 'Here is no thoroughfare.'

</p>
<p>
But a stone bastion, with a narrow gorge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And walls as thick as most skulls born as yet;<br/>
Two batteries, cap-a-pie, as our St. George,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Case-mated one, and t' other 'a barbette,'<br/>
Of Danube's bank took formidable charge;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While two and twenty cannon duly set<br/>
Rose over the town's right side, in bristling tier,<br/>
Forty feet high, upon a cavalier.

</p>
<p>
But from the river the town 's open quite,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Turks could never be persuaded<br/>
A Russian vessel e'er would heave in sight;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And such their creed was, till they were invaded,<br/>
When it grew rather late to set things right.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the Danube could not well be waded,<br/>
They look'd upon the Muscovite flotilla,<br/>
And only shouted, 'Allah!' and 'Bis Millah!'

</p>
<p>
The Russians now were ready to attack:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But oh, ye goddesses of war and glory!<br/>
How shall I spell the name of each Cossacque<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who were immortal, could one tell their story?<br/>
Alas! what to their memory can lack?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles' self was not more grim and gory<br/>
Than thousands of this new and polish'd nation,<br/>
Whose names want nothing but&mdash;pronunciation.

</p>
<p>
Still I 'll record a few, if but to increase<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our euphony: there was Strongenoff, and Strokonoff,<br/>
Meknop, Serge Lwow, Arsniew of modern Greece,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Tschitsshakoff, and Roguenoff, and Chokenoff,<br/>
And others of twelve consonants apiece;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And more might be found out, if I could poke enough<br/>
Into gazettes; but Fame (capricious strumpet),<br/>
It seems, has got an ear as well as trumpet,

</p>
<p>
And cannot tune those discords of narration,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which may be names at Moscow, into rhyme;<br/>
Yet there were several worth commemoration,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As e'er was virgin of a nuptial chime;<br/>
Soft words, too, fitted for the peroration<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Londonderry drawling against time,<br/>
Ending in 'ischskin,' 'ousckin,' 'iffskchy,' 'ouski:<br/>
Of whom we can insert but Rousamouski,

</p>
<p>
Scherematoff and Chrematoff, Koklophti,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Koclobski, Kourakin, and Mouskin Pouskin,<br/>
All proper men of weapons, as e'er scoff'd high<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against a foe, or ran a sabre through skin:<br/>
Little cared they for Mahomet or Mufti,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless to make their kettle-drums a new skin<br/>
Out of their hides, if parchment had grown dear,<br/>
And no more handy substitute been near.

</p>
<p>
Then there were foreigners of much renown,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of various nations, and all volunteers;<br/>
Not fighting for their country or its crown,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But wishing to be one day brigadiers;<br/>
Also to have the sacking of a town,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasant thing to young men at their years.<br/>
'Mongst them were several Englishmen of pith,<br/>
Sixteen call'd Thomson, and nineteen named Smith.

</p>
<p>
Jack Thomson and Bill Thomson; all the rest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been call'd 'Jemmy,' after the great bard;<br/>
I don't know whether they had arms or crest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But such a godfather 's as good a card.<br/>
Three of the Smiths were Peters; but the best<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst them all, hard blows to inflict or ward,<br/>
Was he, since so renown'd 'in country quarters<br/>
At Halifax;' but now he served the Tartars.

</p>
<p>
The rest were jacks and Gills and Wills and Bills;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I 've added that the elder jack Smith<br/>
Was born in Cumberland among the hills,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that his father was an honest blacksmith,<br/>
I 've said all I know of a name that fills<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Three lines of the despatch in taking 'Schmacksmith,'<br/>
A village of Moldavia's waste, wherein<br/>
He fell, immortal in a bulletin.

</p>
<p>
I wonder (although Mars no doubt 's a god<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise) if a man's name in a bulletin<br/>
May make up for a bullet in his body?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this little question is no sin,<br/>
Because, though I am but a simple noddy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one Shakspeare puts the same thought in<br/>
The mouth of some one in his plays so doting,<br/>
Which many people pass for wits by quoting.

</p>
<p>
Then there were Frenchmen, gallant, young, and gay:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I 'm too great a patriot to record<br/>
Their Gallic names upon a glorious day;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I 'd rather tell ten lies than say a word<br/>
Of truth;&mdash;such truths are treason; they betray<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their country; and as traitors are abhorr'd<br/>
Who name the French in English, save to show<br/>
How Peace should make John Bull the Frenchman's foe.

</p>
<p>
The Russians, having built two batteries on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An isle near Ismail, had two ends in view;<br/>
The first was to bombard it, and knock down<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The public buildings and the private too,<br/>
No matter what poor souls might be undone.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The city's shape suggested this, 't is true;<br/>
Form'd like an amphitheatre, each dwelling<br/>
Presented a fine mark to throw a shell in.

</p>
<p>
The second object was to profit by<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of the general consternation,<br/>
To attack the Turk's flotilla, which lay nigh<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremely tranquil, anchor'd at its station:<br/>
But a third motive was as probably<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To frighten them into capitulation;<br/>
A phantasy which sometimes seizes warriors,<br/>
Unless they are game as bull-dogs and fox-terriers.

</p>
<p>
A habit rather blamable, which is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That of despising those we combat with,<br/>
Common in many cases, was in this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause of killing Tchitchitzkoff and Smith;<br/>
One of the valorous 'Smiths' whom we shall miss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of those nineteen who late rhymed to 'pith;'<br/>
But 't is a name so spread o'er 'Sir' and 'Madam,'<br/>
That one would think the first who bore it 'Adam.'

</p>
<p>
The Russian batteries were incomplete,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they were constructed in a hurry;<br/>
Thus the same cause which makes a verse want feet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And throws a cloud o'er Longman and John Murray,<br/>
When the sale of new books is not so fleet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As they who print them think is necessary,<br/>
May likewise put off for a time what story<br/>
Sometimes calls 'murder,' and at others 'glory.'

</p>
<p>
Whether it was their engineer's stupidity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their haste, or waste, I neither know nor care,<br/>
Or some contractor's personal cupidity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving his soul by cheating in the ware<br/>
Of homicide, but there was no solidity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new batteries erected there;<br/>
They either miss'd, or they were never miss'd,<br/>
And added greatly to the missing list.

</p>
<p>
A sad miscalculation about distance<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made all their naval matters incorrect;<br/>
Three fireships lost their amiable existence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they reach'd a spot to take effect:<br/>
The match was lit too soon, and no assistance<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could remedy this lubberly defect;<br/>
They blew up in the middle of the river,<br/>
While, though 't was dawn, the Turks slept fast as ever.

</p>
<p>
At seven they rose, however, and survey'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Russ flotilla getting under way;<br/>
'T was nine, when still advancing undismay'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a cable's length their vessels lay<br/>
Off Ismail, and commenced a cannonade,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was return'd with interest, I may say,<br/>
And by a fire of musketry and grape,<br/>
And shells and shot of every size and shape.

</p>
<p>
For six hours bore they without intermission<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Turkish fire, and aided by their own<br/>
Land batteries, work'd their guns with great precision:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At length they found mere cannonade alone<br/>
By no means would produce the town's submission,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a signal to retreat at one.<br/>
One bark blew up, a second near the works<br/>
Running aground, was taken by the Turks.

</p>
<p>
The Moslem, too, had lost both ships and men;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But when they saw the enemy retire,<br/>
Their Delhis mann'd some boats, and sail'd again,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And gall'd the Russians with a heavy fire,<br/>
And tried to make a landing on the main;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But here the effect fell short of their desire:<br/>
Count Damas drove them back into the water<br/>
Pell-mell, and with a whole gazette of slaughter.

</p>
<p>
'If' (says the historian here) 'I could report<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All that the Russians did upon this day,<br/>
I think that several volumes would fall short,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I should still have many things to say;'<br/>
And so he says no more&mdash;but pays his court<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To some distinguish'd strangers in that fray;<br/>
The Prince de Ligne, and Langeron, and Damas,<br/>
Names great as any that the roll of Fame has.

</p>
<p>
This being the case, may show us what Fame is:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For out of these three 'preux Chevaliers,' how<br/>
Many of common readers give a guess<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That such existed? (and they may live now<br/>
For aught we know.) Renown 's all hit or miss;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There 's fortune even in fame, we must allow.<br/>
'T is true the Memoirs of the Prince de Ligne<br/>
Have half withdrawn from him oblivion's screen.

</p>
<p>
But here are men who fought in gallant actions<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As gallantly as ever heroes fought,<br/>
But buried in the heap of such transactions<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their names are rarely found, nor often sought.<br/>
Thus even good fame may suffer sad contractions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And is extinguish'd sooner than she ought:<br/>
Of all our modern battles, I will bet<br/>
You can't repeat nine names from each Gazette.

</p>
<p>
In short, this last attack, though rich in glory,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Show'd that somewhere, somehow, there was a fault,<br/>
And Admiral Ribas (known in Russian story)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Most strongly recommended an assault;<br/>
In which he was opposed by young and hoary,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which made a long debate; but I must halt,<br/>
For if I wrote down every warrior's speech,<br/>
I doubt few readers e'er would mount the breach.

</p>
<p>
There was a man, if that he was a man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that his manhood could be call'd in question,<br/>
For had he not been Hercules, his span<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been as short in youth as indigestion<br/>
Made his last illness, when, all worn and wan,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He died beneath a tree, as much unblest on<br/>
The soil of the green province he had wasted,<br/>
As e'er was locust on the land it blasted.

</p>
<p>
This was Potemkin&mdash;a great thing in days<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When homicide and harlotry made great;<br/>
If stars and titles could entail long praise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His glory might half equal his estate.<br/>
This fellow, being six foot high, could raise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of phantasy proportionate<br/>
In the then sovereign of the Russian people,<br/>
Who measured men as you would do a steeple.

</p>
<p>
While things were in abeyance, Ribas sent<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A courier to the prince, and he succeeded<br/>
In ordering matters after his own bent;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot tell the way in which he pleaded,<br/>
But shortly he had cause to be content.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mean time, the batteries proceeded,<br/>
And fourscore cannon on the Danube's border<br/>
Were briskly fired and answer'd in due order.

</p>
<p>
But on the thirteenth, when already part<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the troops were embark'd, the siege to raise,<br/>
A courier on the spur inspired new heart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into all panters for newspaper praise,<br/>
As well as dilettanti in war's art,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By his despatches couch'd in pithy phrase;<br/>
Announcing the appointment of that lover of<br/>
Battles to the command, Field-Marshal Souvaroff.

</p>
<p>
The letter of the prince to the same marshal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was worthy of a Spartan, had the cause<br/>
Been one to which a good heart could be partial&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence of freedom, country, or of laws;<br/>
But as it was mere lust of power to o'er-arch all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With its proud brow, it merits slight applause,<br/>
Save for its style, which said, all in a trice,<br/>
'You will take Ismail at whatever price.'

</p>
<p>
'Let there be light! said God, and there was light!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let there be blood!' says man, and there 's a seal<br/>
The fiat of this spoil'd child of the Night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(For Day ne'er saw his merits) could decree<br/>
More evil in an hour, than thirty bright<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Summers could renovate, though they should be<br/>
Lovely as those which ripen'd Eden's fruit;<br/>
For war cuts up not only branch, but root.

</p>
<p>
Our friends the Turks, who with loud 'Allahs' now<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Began to signalise the Russ retreat,<br/>
Were damnably mistaken; few are slow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In thinking that their enemy is beat<br/>
(Or beaten, if you insist on grammar, though<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I never think about it in a heat),<br/>
But here I say the Turks were much mistaken,<br/>
Who hating hogs, yet wish'd to save their bacon.

</p>
<p>
For, on the sixteenth, at full gallop, drew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In sight two horsemen, who were deem'd Cossacques<br/>
For some time, till they came in nearer view.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They had but little baggage at their backs,<br/>
For there were but three shirts between the two;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But on they rode upon two Ukraine hacks,<br/>
Till, in approaching, were at length descried<br/>
In this plain pair, Suwarrow and his guide.

</p>
<p>
'Great joy to London now!' says some great fool,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When London had a grand illumination,<br/>
Which to that bottle-conjurer, John Bull,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is of all dreams the first hallucination;<br/>
So that the streets of colour'd lamps are full,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Sage (said john) surrenders at discretion<br/>
His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,<br/>
To gratify, like a huge moth, this one sense.

</p>
<p>
'T is strange that he should farther 'damn his eyes,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For they are damn'd; that once all-famous oath<br/>
Is to the devil now no farther prize,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since John has lately lost the use of both.<br/>
Debt he calls wealth, and taxes Paradise;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Famine, with her gaunt and bony growth,<br/>
Which stare him in the face, he won't examine,<br/>
Or swears that Ceres hath begotten Famine.

</p>
<p>
But to the tale:&mdash;great joy unto the camp!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Russian, Tartar, English, French, Cossacque,<br/>
O'er whom Suwarrow shone like a gas lamp,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Presaging a most luminous attack;<br/>
Or like a wisp along the marsh so damp,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which leads beholders on a boggy walk,<br/>
He flitted to and fro a dancing light,<br/>
Which all who saw it follow'd, wrong or right.

</p>
<p>
But certes matters took a different face;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There was enthusiasm and much applause,<br/>
The fleet and camp saluted with great grace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all presaged good fortune to their cause.<br/>
Within a cannon-shot length of the place<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They drew, constructed ladders, repair'd flaws<br/>
In former works, made new, prepared fascines,<br/>
And all kinds of benevolent machines.

</p>
<p>
'T is thus the spirit of a single mind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes that of multitudes take one direction,<br/>
As roll the waters to the breathing wind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or roams the herd beneath the bull's protection;<br/>
Or as a little dog will lead the blind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a bell-wether form the flock's connection<br/>
By tinkling sounds, when they go forth to victual;<br/>
Such is the sway of your great men o'er little.

</p>
<p>
The whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That they were going to a marriage feast<br/>
(This metaphor, I think, holds good as aught,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is discord after both at least):<br/>
There was not now a luggage boy but sought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Danger and spoil with ardour much increased;<br/>
And why? because a little&mdash;odd&mdash;old man,<br/>
Stript to his shirt, was come to lead the van.

</p>
<p>
But so it was; and every preparation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was made with all alacrity: the first<br/>
Detachment of three columns took its station,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And waited but the signal's voice to burst<br/>
Upon the foe: the second's ordination<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was also in three columns, with a thirst<br/>
For glory gaping o'er a sea of slaughter:<br/>
The third, in columns two, attack'd by water.

</p>
<p>
New batteries were erected, and was held<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A general council, in which unanimity,<br/>
That stranger to most councils, here prevail'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As sometimes happens in a great extremity;<br/>
And every difficulty being dispell'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory began to dawn with due sublimity,<br/>
While Souvaroff, determined to obtain it,<br/>
Was teaching his recruits to use the bayonet

</p>
<p>
It is an actual fact, that he, commander<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In chief, in proper person deign'd to drill<br/>
The awkward squad, and could afford to squander<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His time, a corporal's duty to fulfil:<br/>
Just as you 'd break a sucking salamander<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To swallow flame, and never take it ill:<br/>
He show'd them how to mount a ladder (which<br/>
Was not like Jacob's) or to cross a ditch.

</p>
<p>
Also he dress'd up, for the nonce, fascines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like men with turbans, scimitars, and dirks,<br/>
And made them charge with bayonet these machines,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of lesson against actual Turks:<br/>
And when well practised in these mimic scenes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He judged them proper to assail the works;<br/>
At which your wise men sneer'd in phrases witty:<br/>
He made no answer; but he took the city.

</p>
<p>
Most things were in this posture on the eve<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the assault, and all the camp was in<br/>
A stern repose; which you would scarce conceive;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet men resolved to dash through thick and thin<br/>
Are very silent when they once believe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That all is settled:&mdash;there was little din,<br/>
For some were thinking of their home and friends,<br/>
And others of themselves and latter ends.

</p>
<p>
Suwarrow chiefly was on the alert,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveying, drilling, ordering, jesting, pondering;<br/>
For the man was, we safely may assert,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing to wonder at beyond most wondering;<br/>
Hero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Praying, instructing, desolating, plundering;<br/>
Now Mars, now Momus; and when bent to storm<br/>
A fortress, Harlequin in uniform.

</p>
<p>
The day before the assault, while upon drill&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For this great conqueror play'd the corporal&mdash;<br/>
Some Cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had met a party towards the twilight's fall,<br/>
One of whom spoke their tongue&mdash;or well or ill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was much that he was understood at all;<br/>
But whether from his voice, or speech, or manner,<br/>
They found that he had fought beneath their banner.

</p>
<p>
Whereon immediately at his request<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;<br/>
Their dress was Moslem, but you might have guess'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That these were merely masquerading Tartars,<br/>
And that beneath each Turkish-fashion'd vest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lurk'd Christianity; which sometimes barters<br/>
Her inward grace for outward show, and makes<br/>
It difficult to shun some strange mistakes.

</p>
<p>
Suwarrow, who was standing in his shirt<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a company of Calmucks, drilling,<br/>
Exclaiming, fooling, swearing at the inert,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lecturing on the noble art of killing,&mdash;<br/>
For deeming human clay but common dirt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This great philosopher was thus instilling<br/>
His maxims, which to martial comprehension<br/>
Proved death in battle equal to a pension;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Suwarrow, when he saw this company<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Cossacques and their prey, turn'd round and cast<br/>
Upon them his slow brow and piercing eye:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whence come ye?'&mdash;'From Constantinople last,<br/>
Captives just now escaped,' was the reply.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'What are ye?'&mdash;'What you see us.' Briefly pass'd<br/>
This dialogue; for he who answer'd knew<br/>
To whom he spoke, and made his words but few.

</p>
<p>
'Your names?'&mdash;'Mine 's Johnson, and my comrade 's Juan;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two are women, and the third<br/>
Is neither man nor woman.' The chief threw on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The party a slight glance, then said, 'I have heard<br/>
Your name before, the second is a new one:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring the other three here was absurd:<br/>
But let that pass:<br/>
&mdash;I think I have heard your name<br/>
In the Nikolaiew regiment?'&mdash;'The same.'

</p>
<p>
'You served at Widdin?'&mdash;'Yes.'&mdash;'You led the attack?'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'I did.'&mdash;'What next?'&mdash;'I really hardly know.'<br/>
'You were the first i' the breach?'&mdash;'I was not slack<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least to follow those who might be so.'<br/>
'What follow'd?'&mdash;'A shot laid me on my back,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I became a prisoner to the foe.'<br/>
'You shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded<br/>
Is twice as strong as that where you were wounded.

</p>
<p>
'Where will you serve?'&mdash;'Where'er you please.'&mdash;'I know<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You like to be the hope of the forlorn,<br/>
And doubtless would be foremost on the foe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After the hardships you 've already borne.<br/>
And this young fellow&mdash;say what can he do?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He with the beardless chin and garments torn?'<br/>
'Why, general, if he hath no greater fault<br/>
In war than love, he had better lead the assault.'

</p>
<p>
'He shall if that he dare.' Here Juan bow'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Low as the compliment deserved. Suwarrow<br/>
Continued: 'Your old regiment's allow'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By special providence, to lead to-morrow,<br/>
Or it may be to-night, the assault: I have vow'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To several saints, that shortly plough or harrow<br/>
Shall pass o'er what was Ismail, and its tusk<br/>
Be unimpeded by the proudest mosque.

</p>
<p>
'So now, my lads, for glory!'<br/>
&mdash;Here he turn'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And drill'd away in the most classic Russian,<br/>
Until each high, heroic bosom burn'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For cash and conquest, as if from a cushion<br/>
A preacher had held forth (who nobly spurn'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All earthly goods save tithes) and bade them push on<br/>
To slay the Pagans who resisted, battering<br/>
The armies of the Christian Empress Catherine.

</p>
<p>
Johnson, who knew by this long colloquy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself a favourite, ventured to address<br/>
Suwarrow, though engaged with accents high<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his resumed amusement. 'I confess<br/>
My debt in being thus allow'd to die<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the foremost; but if you 'd express<br/>
Explicitly our several posts, my friend<br/>
And self would know what duty to attend.'

</p>
<p>
'Right! I was busy, and forgot. Why, you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will join your former regiment, which should be<br/>
Now under arms. Ho! Katskoff, take him to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Here he call'd up a Polish orderly)<br/>
His post, I mean the regiment Nikolaiew:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The stranger stripling may remain with me;<br/>
He 's a fine boy. The women may be sent<br/>
To the other baggage, or to the sick tent.'

</p>
<p>
But here a sort of scene began to ensue:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladies,&mdash;who by no means had been bred<br/>
To be disposed of in a way so new,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although their haram education led<br/>
Doubtless to that of doctrines the most true,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Passive obedience,&mdash;now raised up the head,<br/>
With flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung<br/>
Their arms, as hens their wings about their young,

</p>
<p>
O'er the promoted couple of brave men<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who were thus honour'd by the greatest chief<br/>
That ever peopled hell with heroes slain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or plunged a province or a realm in grief.<br/>
O, foolish mortals! Always taught in vain!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O, glorious laurel! since for one sole leaf<br/>
Of thine imaginary deathless tree,<br/>
Of blood and tears must flow the unebbing sea.

</p>
<p>
Suwarrow, who had small regard for tears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And not much sympathy for blood, survey'd<br/>
The women with their hair about their ears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And natural agonies, with a slight shade<br/>
Of feeling: for however habit sears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Men's hearts against whole millions, when their trade<br/>
Is butchery, sometimes a single sorrow<br/>
Will touch even heroes&mdash;and such was Suwarrow.

</p>
<p>
He said,&mdash;and in the kindest Calmuck tone,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Why, Johnson, what the devil do you mean<br/>
By bringing women here? They shall be shown<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All the attention possible, and seen<br/>
In safety to the waggons, where alone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact they can be safe. You should have been<br/>
Aware this kind of baggage never thrives:<br/>
Save wed a year, I hate recruits with wives.'

</p>
<p>
'May it please your excellency,' thus replied<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our British friend, 'these are the wives of others,<br/>
And not our own. I am too qualified<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By service with my military brothers<br/>
To break the rules by bringing one's own bride<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a camp: I know that nought so bothers<br/>
The hearts of the heroic on a charge,<br/>
As leaving a small family at large.

</p>
<p>
'But these are but two Turkish ladies, who<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With their attendant aided our escape,<br/>
And afterwards accompanied us through<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand perils in this dubious shape.<br/>
To me this kind of life is not so new;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To them, poor things, it is an awkward scrape.<br/>
I therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,<br/>
Request that they may both be used genteelly.'

</p>
<p>
Meantime these two poor girls, with swimming eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look'd on as if in doubt if they could trust<br/>
Their own protectors; nor was their surprise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than their grief (and truly not less just)<br/>
To see an old man, rather wild than wise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In aspect, plainly clad, besmear'd with dust,<br/>
Stript to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,<br/>
More fear'd than all the sultans ever seen.

</p>
<p>
For every thing seem'd resting on his nod,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As they could read in all eyes. Now to them,<br/>
Who were accustom'd, as a sort of god,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the sultan, rich in many a gem,<br/>
Like an imperial peacock stalk abroad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(That royal bird, whose tail 's a diadem),<br/>
With all the pomp of power, it was a doubt<br/>
How power could condescend to do without.

</p>
<p>
John Johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though little versed in feelings oriental,<br/>
Suggested some slight comfort in his way:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don Juan, who was much more sentimental,<br/>
Swore they should see him by the dawn of day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that the Russian army should repent all:<br/>
And, strange to say, they found some consolation<br/>
In this&mdash;for females like exaggeration.

</p>
<p>
And then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They parted for the present&mdash;these to await,<br/>
According to the artillery's hits or misses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate<br/>
(Uncertainty is one of many blisses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A mortgage on Humanity's estate)&mdash;<br/>
While their beloved friends began to arm,<br/>
To burn a town which never did them harm.

</p>
<p>
Suwarrow,&mdash;who but saw things in the gross,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being much too gross to see them in detail,<br/>
Who calculated life as so much dross,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the wind a widow'd nation's wail,<br/>
And cared as little for his army's loss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(So that their efforts should at length prevail)<br/>
As wife and friends did for the boils of job,&mdash;<br/>
What was 't to him to hear two women sob?

</p>
<p>
Nothing.<br/>
&mdash;The work of glory still went on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparations for a cannonade<br/>
As terrible as that of Ilion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If Homer had found mortars ready made;<br/>
But now, instead of slaying Priam's son,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We only can but talk of escalade,<br/>
Bombs, drums, guns, bastions, batteries, bayonets, bullets,&mdash;<br/>
Hard words, which stick in the soft Muses' gullets.

</p>
<p>
O, thou eternal Homer! who couldst charm<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All cars, though long; all ages, though so short,<br/>
By merely wielding with poetic arm<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Arms to which men will never more resort,<br/>
Unless gunpowder should be found to harm<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Much less than is the hope of every court,<br/>
Which now is leagued young Freedom to annoy;<br/>
But they will not find Liberty a Troy:&mdash;

</p>
<p>
O, thou eternal Homer! I have now<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To paint a siege, wherein more men were slain,<br/>
With deadlier engines and a speedier blow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than in thy Greek gazette of that campaign;<br/>
And yet, like all men else, I must allow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To vie with thee would be about as vain<br/>
As for a brook to cope with ocean's flood;<br/>
But still we moderns equal you in blood;

</p>
<p>
If not in poetry, at least in fact;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fact is truth, the grand desideratum!<br/>
Of which, howe'er the Muse describes each act,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be ne'ertheless a slight substratum.<br/>
But now the town is going to be attack'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Great deeds are doing&mdash;how shall I relate 'em?<br/>
Souls of immortal generals! Phoebus watches<br/>
To colour up his rays from your despatches.

</p>
<p>
O, ye great bulletins of Bonaparte!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O, ye less grand long lists of kill'd and wounded!<br/>
Shade of Leonidas, who fought so hearty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When my poor Greece was once, as now, surrounded!<br/>
O, Caesar's Commentaries! now impart, ye<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadows of glory! (lest I be confounded)<br/>
A portion of your fading twilight hues,<br/>
So beautiful, so fleeting, to the Muse.

</p>
<p>
When I call 'fading' martial immortality,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, that every age and every year,<br/>
And almost every day, in sad reality,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some sucking hero is compell'd to rear,<br/>
Who, when we come to sum up the totality<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of deeds to human happiness most dear,<br/>
Turns out to be a butcher in great business,<br/>
Afflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness.

</p>
<p>
Medals, rank, ribands, lace, embroidery, scarlet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are things immortal to immortal man,<br/>
As purple to the Babylonian harlot:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An uniform to boys is like a fan<br/>
To women; there is scarce a crimson varlet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But deems himself the first in Glory's van.<br/>
But Glory's glory; and if you would find<br/>
What that is&mdash;ask the pig who sees the wind!

</p>
<p>
At least he feels it, and some say he sees,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he runs before it like a pig;<br/>
Or, if that simple sentence should displease,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, that he scuds before it like a brig,<br/>
A schooner, or&mdash;but it is time to ease<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.<br/>
The next shall ring a peal to shake all people,<br/>
Like a bob-major from a village steeple.

</p>
<p>
Hark! through the silence of the cold, dull night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hum of armies gathering rank on rank!<br/>
Lo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the leaguer'd wall and bristling bank<br/>
Of the arm'd river, while with straggling light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars peep through the vapours dim and dank,<br/>
Which curl in curious wreaths:&mdash;how soon the smoke<br/>
Of Hell shall pall them in a deeper cloak!

</p>
<p>
Here pause we for the present&mdash;as even then<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That awful pause, dividing life from death,<br/>
Struck for an instant on the hearts of men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of whom were drawing their last breath!<br/>
A moment&mdash;and all will be life again!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The march! the charge! the shouts of either faith!<br/>
Hurra! and Allah! and&mdash;one moment more,<br/>
The death-cry drowning in the battle's roar.
