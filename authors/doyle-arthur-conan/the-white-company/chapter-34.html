<P>
WHILST the council was sitting in Pampeluna the White Company,
having encamped in a neighboring valley, close to the companies
of La Nuit and of Black Ortingo, were amusing themselves with
sword-play, wrestling, and shooting at the shields, which they
had placed upon the hillside to serve them as butts.  The younger
archers, with their coats of mail thrown aside, their brown or
flaxen hair tossing in the wind, and their jerkins turned back to
give free play to their brawny chests and arms, stood in lines,
each loosing his shaft in turn, while Johnston, Aylward, Black
Simon, and half-a-score of the elders lounged up and down with
critical eyes, and a word of rough praise or of curt censure for
the marksmen.  Behind stood knots of Gascon and Brabant
crossbowmen from the companies of Ortingo and of La Nuit, leaning
upon their unsightly weapons and watching the practice of the
Englishmen.
<P>
"A good shot, Hewett, a good shot!" said old Johnston to a young
bowman, who stood with his bow in his left hand, gazing with
parted lips after his flying shaft.  "You see, she finds the
ring, as I knew she would from the moment that your string
twanged."
<P>
"Loose it easy, steady, and yet sharp," said Aylward.  "By my
hilt! mon gar., it is very well when you do but shoot at a
shield.  but when there is a man behind the shield, and he rides
at you with wave of sword and glint of eyes from behind his
vizor, you may find him a less easy mark."
<P>
"It is a mark that I have found before now," answered the young
bowman.
<P>
"And shall again, camarade, I doubt not.  But hola! Johnston, who
is this who holds his bow like a crow-keeper?"
<P>
"It is Silas Peterson, of Horsham.  Do not wink with one eye and
look with the other, Silas, and do not hop and dance after you
shoot, with your tongue out, for that will not speed it upon its
way.  Stand straight and firm, as God made you. Move not the bow
arm, and steady with the drawing hand!"
<P>
"I' faith," said Black Simon, "I am a spearman myself, and am
more fitted for hand-strokes than for such work as this.  Yet I
have spent my days among bowmen, and I have seen many a brave
shaft sped.  I will not say but that we have some good marksmen
here, and that this Company would be accounted a fine body of
archers at any time or place.  Yet I do not see any men who bend
so strong a bow or shoot as true a shaft as those whom I have
known."
<P>
"You say sooth," said Johnston, turning his seamed and grizzled
face upon the man-at-arms.  "See yonder," he added, pointing to a
bombard which lay within the camp: "there is what hath done scath
to good bowmanship, with its filthy soot and foolish roaring
mouth.  I wonder that a true knight, like our prince, should
carry such a scurvy thing in his train.  Robin, thou red-headed
lurden, how oft must I tell thee not to shoot straight with a
quarter-wind blowing across the mark?"
<P>
"By these ten finger-bones! there were some fine bowmen at the
intaking of Calais," said Aylward.  "I well remember that, on
occasion of an outfall, a Genoan raised his arm over his mantlet,
and shook it at us, a hundred paces from our line. There were
twenty who loosed shafts at him, and when the man was afterwards
slain it was found that he had taken eighteen through his
forearm."
<P>
"And I can call to mind," remarked Johnston, "that when the great
cog 'Christopher,' which the French had taken from us, was moored
two hundred paces from the shore, two archers, little Robin
Withstaff and Elias Baddlesmere, in four shots each cut every
strand of her hempen anchor-cord, so that she well-nigh came upon
the rocks."
<P>
"Good shooting, i' faith rare shooting!" said Black Simon. "But I
have seen you, Johnston, and you, Samkin Aylwart, and one or two
others who are still with us, shoot as well as the best.  Was it
not you, Johnston, who took the fat ox at Finsbury butts against
the pick of London town?"
<P>
A sunburnt and black-eyed Brabanter had stood near the old
archers, leaning upon a large crossbow and listening to their
talk, which had been carried on in that hybrid camp dialect which
both nations could understand.  He was a squat, bull-necked man,
clad in the iron helmet, mail tunic, and woollen gambesson of his
class.  A jacket with hanging sleeves, slashed with velvet at the
neck and wrists, showed that he was a man of some consideration,
an under-officer, or file-leader of his company.
<P>
"I cannot think," said he, "why you English should be so fond of
your six-foot stick.  If it amuse you to bend it, well and good;
but why should I strain and pull, when my little moulinet will do
all for me, and better than I can do it for myself?"
<P>
"I have seen good shooting with the prod and with the latch,"
said Aylward, "but, by my hilt! camarade, with all respect to you
and to your bow, I think that is but a woman's weapon, which a
woman can point and loose as easily as a man."
<P>
"I know not about that," answered the Brabanter, "but this I
know, that though I have served for fourteen years, I have never
yet seen an Englishman do aught with the long-bow which I could
not do better with my arbalest.  By the three kings!  I would
even go further, and say that I have done things with my arbalest
which no Englishman could do with his long-bow."
<P>
"Well said, mon gar.," cried Aylward.  "A good cock has ever a
brave call.  Now, I have shot little of late, but there is
Johnston here who will try a round with you for the honor of the
Company."
<P>
"And I will lay a gallon of Jurancon wine upon the long-bow,"
said Black Simon, "though I had rather, for my own drinking, that
it were a quart of Twynham ale."
<P>
"I take both your challenge and your wager," said the man of
Brabant, throwing off his jacket and glancing keenly about him
with his black, twinkling eyes.  "I cannot see any fitting mark,
for I care not to waste a bolt upon these shields, which a
drunken boor could not miss at a village kermesse."
<P>
"This is a perilous man," whispered an English man-at-arms,
plucking at Aylward's sleeve.  "He is the best marksman of all
the crossbow companies and it was he who brought down the
Constable de Bourbon at Brignais, I fear that your man will come
by little honor with him."
<P>
"Yet I have seen Johnston shoot these twenty years, and I will
not flinch from it.  How say you, old warhound, will you not have
a flight shot or two with this springald?"
<P>
"Tut, tut, Aylward," said the old bowman.  " My day is past, and
it is for the younger ones to hold what we have gained.  I take
it unkindly of thee, Samkin, that thou shouldst call all eyes
thus upon a broken bowman who could once shoot a fair shaft. Let
me feel that bow, Wilkins!  It is a Scotch bow, I see, for the
upper nock is without and the lower within.  By the black rood!
it is a good piece of yew, well nocked, well strung, well waxed,
and very joyful to the feel.  I think even now that I might hit
any large and goodly mark with a bow like this.  Turn thy quiver
to me, Aylward.  I love an ash arrow pierced with cornel-wood for
a roving shaft."
<P>
"By my hilt! and so do I," cried Aylward.  "These three gander-
winged shafts are such."
<P>
"So I see, comrade.  It has been my wont to choose a saddle-
backed feather for a dead shaft, and a swine-backed for a smooth
flier.  I will take the two of them.  Ah! Samkin, lad, the eye
grows dim and the hand less firm as the years pass."
<P>
"Come then, are you not ready?" said the Brabanter, who had
watched with ill-concealed impatience the slow and methodic
movements of his antagonist.
<P>
"I will venture a rover with you, or try long-butts or hoyles,"
said old Johnston.  "To my mind the long-bow is a better weapon
than the arbalest, but it may be ill for me to prove it."
<P>
"So I think," quoth the other with a sneer.  He drew his moulinet
from his girdle, and fixing it to the windlass, he drew back the
powerful double cord until it had clicked into the catch.  Then
from his quiver he drew a short, thick quarrel, which he placed
with the utmost care upon the groove.  Word had spread of what
was going forward, and the rivals were already surrounded, not
only by the English archers of the Company, but by hundreds of
arbalestiers and men-at-arms from the bands of Ortingo and La
Nuit, to the latter of which the Brabanter belonged.
<P>
"There is a mark yonder on the hill," said he; "mayhap you can
discern it."
<P>
"I see something," answered Johnston, shading his eyes with his
hand; "but it is a very long shoot."
<P>
"A fair shoot--a fair shoot!  Stand aside, Arnaud, lest you find
a bolt through your gizzard.  Now, comrade, I take no flight
shot, and I give you the vantage of watching my shaft."
<P>
As he spoke he raised his arbalest to his shoulder and was about
to pull the trigger, when a large gray stork flapped heavily into
view skimming over the brow of the hill, and then soaring up into
the air to pass the valley.  Its shrill and piercing cries drew
all eyes upon it, and, as it came nearer, a dark spot which
circled above it resolved itself into a peregrine falcon, which
hovered over its head, poising itself from time to time, and
watching its chance of closing with its clumsy quarry.  Nearer
and nearer came the two birds, all absorbed in their own contest,
the stork wheeling upwards, the hawk still fluttering above it,
until they were not a hundred paces from the camp.  The Brabanter
raised his weapon to the sky, and there came the short, deep
twang of his powerful string.  His bolt struck the stork just
where its wing meets the body, and the bird whirled aloft in a
last convulsive flutter before falling wounded and flapping to
the earth.  A roar of applause burst from the crossbowmen; but at
the instant that the bolt struck its mark old Johnston, who had
stood listlessly with arrow on string, bent his bow and sped a
shaft through the body of the falcon.  Whipping the other from
his belt, he sent it skimming some few feet from the earth with
so true an aim that it struck and transfixed the stork for the
second time ere it could reach the ground.  A deep-chested shout
of delight burst from the archers at the sight of this double
feat, and Aylward, dancing with joy, threw his arms round the old
marksman and embraced him with such vigor that their mail tunics
clanged again.
<P>
"Ah! camarade," he cried, "you shall have a stoup with me for
this!  What then, old dog, would not the hawk please thee, but
thou must have the stork as well.  Oh, to my heart again!"
<P>
"It is a pretty piece of yew, and well strung," said Johnston
with a twinkle in his deep-set gray eyes.  "Even an old broken
bowman might find the clout with a bow like this."
<P>
"You have done very well," remarked the Brabanter in a surly
voice.  "But it seems to me that you have not yet shown yourself
to be a better marksman than I, for I have struck that at which I
aimed, and, by the three kings! no man can do more."
<P>
"It would ill beseem me to claim to be a better marksman,"
answered Johnston, "for I have heard great things of your skill.
I did but wish to show that the long-bow could do that which an
arbalest could not do, for you could not with your moulinet have
your string ready to speed another shaft ere the bird drop to the
earth."
<P>
"In that you have vantage," said the crossbowman.  "By Saint
James! it is now my turn to show you where my weapon has the
better of you.  I pray you to draw a flight shaft with all your
strength down the valley, that we may see the length of your
shoot."
<P>
"That is a very strong prod of yours," said Johnston, shaking his
grizzled head as he glanced at the thick arch and powerful
strings of his rival's arbalest.  "I have little doubt that you
can overshoot me, and yet I have seen bowmen who could send a
cloth-yard arrow further than you could speed a quarrel."
<P>
"So I have heard," remarked the Brabanter; "and yet it is a
strange thing that these wondrous bowmen are never where I chance
to be.  Pace out the distances with a wand at every five score,
and do you, Arnaud, stand at the fifth wand to carry back my
bolts to me."
<P>
A line was measured down the valley, and Johnston, drawing an
arrow to the very head, sent it whistling over the row of wands.
<P>
"Bravely drawn!  A rare shoot!" shouted the bystanders.
<P>
"It is well up to the fourth mark."
<P>
"By my hilt! it is over it," cried Aylward.  "I can see where
they have stooped to gather up the shaft."
<P>
"We shall hear anon," said Johnston quietly, and presently a
young archer came running to say that the arrow had fallen twenty
paces beyond the fourth wand.
<P>
"Four hundred paces and a score," cried Black Simon.  "I' faith,
it is a very long flight.  Yet wood and steel may do more than
flesh and blood."
<P>
The Brabanter stepped forward with a smile of conscious triumph,
and loosed the cord of his weapon.  A shout burst from his
comrades as they watched the swift and lofty flight of the heavy
bolt.
<P>
"Over the fourth!" groaned Aylward.  "By my hilt! I think that it
is well up to the fifth."
<P>
"It is over the fifth!" cried a Gascon loudly, and a comrade came
running with waving arms to say that the bolt had pitched eight
paces beyond the mark of the five hundred.
<P>
"Which weapon hath the vantage now?" cried the Brabanter,
Strutting proudly about with shouldered arbalest, amid the
applause of his companions.
<P>
"You can overshoot me," said Johnston gently.
<P>
"Or any other man who ever bent a long-bow," cried his victorious
adversary.
<P>
"Nay, not so fast," said a huge archer, whose mighty shoulders
and red head towered high above the throng of his comrades. "I
must have a word with you ere you crow so loudly.  Where is my
little popper?  By sainted Dick of Hampole! it will be a strange
thing if I cannot outshoot that thing of thine, which to my eyes
is more like a rat-trap than a bow.  Will you try another flight,
or do you stand by your last?"
<P>
"Five hundred and eight paces will serve my turn," answered the
Brabanter, looking askance at this new opponent.
<P>
"Tut, John," whispered Aylward, "you never were a marksman.  Why
must you thrust your spoon into this dish?"
<P>
"Easy and slow, Aylward.  There are very many things which I
cannot do, but there are also one or two which I have the trick
of.  It is in my mind that I can beat this shoot, if my bow will
but hold together."
<P>
"Go on, old babe of the woods!" "Have at it, Hampshire!" cried
the archers laughing.
<P>
"By my soul! you may grin," cried John.  "But I learned how to
make the long shoot from old Hob Miller of Milford." He took up a
great black bow, as he spoke, and sitting down upon the ground he
placed his two feet on either end of the stave.  With an arrow
fitted, he then pulled the string towards him with both hands
until the head of the shaft was level with the wood.  The great
bow creaked and groaned and the cord vibrated with the tension.
<P>
"Who is this fool's-head who stands in the way of my shoot?" said
he, craning up his neck from the ground.
<P>
"He stands on the further side of my mark," answered the
Brabanter, "so he has little to fear from you."
<P>
"Well, the saints assoil him!" cried John.  "Though I think he is
over-near to be scathed."  As he spoke he raised his two feet,
with the bow-stave upon their soles, and his cord twanged with a
deep rich hum which might be heard across the valley. The
measurer in the distance fell flat upon his face, and then
jumping up again, he began to run in the opposite direction.
<P>
"Well shot, old lad!  It is indeed over his head," cried the
bowmen.
<P>
"Mon Dieu!" exclaimed the Brabanter, "who ever saw such a shoot?"
<P>
"It is but a trick," quoth John.  "Many a time have I won a
gallon of ale by covering a mile in three flights down Wilverley
Chase."
<P>
"It fell a hundred and thirty paces beyond the fifth mark,"
shouted an archer in the distance.
<P>
"Six hundred and thirty paces! Mon Dieu! but that is a shoot!
And yet it says nothing for your weapon, mon gros camarade, for
it was by turning yourself into a crossbow that you did it."
<P>
"By my hilt! there is truth in that," cried Aylward.  "And now,
friend, I will myself show you a vantage of the long-bow. I pray
you to speed a bolt against yonder shield with all your force.
It is an inch of elm with bull's hide over it."
<P>
"I scarce shot as many shafts at Brignais," growled the man of
Brabant; "though I found a better mark there than a cantle of
bull's hide.  But what is this, Englishman?  The shield hangs not
one hundred paces from me, and a blind man could strike it."  He
screwed up his string to the furthest pitch, and shot his quarrel
at the dangling shield.  Aylward, who had drawn an arrow from his
quiver, carefully greased the head of it, and sped it at the same
mark.
<P>
"Run, Wilkins," quoth he, "and fetch me the shield."
<P>
Long were the faces of the Englishmen and broad the laugh of the
crossbowmen as the heavy mantlet was carried towards them, for
there in the centre was the thick Brabant bolt driven deeply into
the wood, while there was neither sign nor trace of the cloth-
yard shaft.
<P>
"By the three kings!" cried the Brabanter, "this time at least
there is no gainsaying which is the better weapon, or which the
truer hand that held it.  You have missed the shield,
Englishman."
<P>
"Tarry a bit!  tarry a bit, mon gar.!" quoth Aylward, and turning
round the shield he showed a round clear hole in the wood at the
back of it.  "My shaft has passed through it, camarade, and I
trow the one which goes through is more to be feared than that
which bides on the way,"
<P>
The Brabanter stamped his foot with mortification, and was about
to make some angry reply, when Alleyne Edricson came riding up to
the crowds of archers.
<P>
"Sir Nigel will be here anon," said he, "and it is his wish to
speak with the Company."
<P>
In an instant order and method took the place of general
confusion.  Bows, steel caps, and jacks were caught up from the
grass.  A long cordon cleared the camp of all strangers, while
the main body fell into four lines with under-officers and file-
leaders in front and on either flank.  So they stood, silent and
motionless, when their leader came riding towards them, his face
shining and his whole small figure swelling with the news which
he bore.
<P>
"Great honor has been done to us, men," cried he: "for, of all
the army, the prince has chosen us out that we should ride
onwards into the lands of Spain to spy upon our enemies.  Yet, as
there are many of us, and as the service may not be to the liking
of all, I pray that those will step forward from the ranks who
have the will to follow me."
<P>
There was a rustle among the bowmen, but when Sir Nigel looked up
at them no man stood forward from his fellows, but the four lines
of men stretched unbroken as before.  Sir Nigel blinked at them
in amazement, and a look of the deepest sorrow shadowed his face.
<P>
"That I should live to see the day!" he cried, "What! not one----
"
<P>
"My fair lord," whispered Alleyne, "they have all stepped
forward."
<P>
"Ah, by Saint Paul! I see how it is with them.  I could not think
that they would desert me.  We start at dawn to-morrow, and ye
are to have the horses of Sir Robert Cheney's company. Be ready,
I pray ye, at early cock-crow."
<P>
A buzz of delight burst from the archers, as they broke their
ranks and ran hither and thither, whooping and cheering like boys
who have news of a holiday.  Sir Nigel gazed after them with a
smiling face, when a heavy hand fell upon his shoulder.
<P>
"What ho! my knight-errant of Twynham!" said a voice, "You are
off to Ebro, I hear; and, by the holy fish of Tobias! you must
take me under your banner."
<P>
"What!  Sir Oliver Buttesthorn!" cried Sir Nigel.  "I had heard
that you were come into camp, and had hoped to see you. Glad and
proud shall I be to have you with me."
<P>
"I have a most particular and weighty reason for wishing to go,"
said the sturdy knight.
<P>
"I can well believe it," returned Sir Nigel; "I have met no man
who is quicker to follow where honor leads."
<P>
"Nay, it is not for honor that I go, Nigel."
<P>
"For what then?"
<P>
"For pullets."
<P>
"Pullets?"
<P>
"Yes, for the rascal vanguard have cleared every hen from the
country-side.  It was this very morning that Norbury, my squire,
lamed his horse in riding round in quest of one, for we have a
bag of truffles, and nought to eat with them.  Never have I seen
such locusts as this vanguard of ours.  Not a pullet shall we see
until we are in front of therm; so I shall leave my Winchester
runagates to the care of the provost-marshal, and I shall hie
south with you, Nigel, with my truffles at my saddle-bow."
<P>
"Oliver, Oliver, I know you over-well," said Sir Nigel, shaking
his head, and the two old soldiers rode off together to their
pavilion.
