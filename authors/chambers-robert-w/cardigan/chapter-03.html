<p>At late candle-light, Sir William still tarrying, I went to the
north block-house, where Mr. Duncan, the lieutenant commanding
the guard, received me with unusual courtesy, the reason of which
I did not at the time suspect.</p>

<p>"An express from Sir William has at this moment come in," said
he. "Sir William is aware that a belt-bearer from Virginia awaits
him."</p>

<p>"How could Sir William, who is at Castle Cumberland, know that?"
I began, then was silent, as it flashed into my mind that Mistress
Molly had sent an express to Sir William as soon as I had told
her about the strange Cayuga. That was the galloping horseman
I had heard.</p>

<p>Pondering and perplexed, I looked up to find Mr. Duncan smiling
at me.</p>

<p>"I understand," said he, "that Sir William is pleased to approve
your conduct touching the strange Cayuga."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" I asked, quickly, my heart warming with pleasure.</p>

<p>"I know this," said Mr. Duncan, laughing, "that Sir William has
left something for you with me, a present, in fact, which I am
to deliver to you on the morrow."</p>

<p>"What is it, Mr. Duncan?" I teased; but the laughing officer
shook his head, retiring into the guard-room and pretending to
be afraid of me.</p>

<p>The soldiers, lounging around the settles, pipes between their
teeth, looked on with respectful grins. Clearly, even they appeared
to know what Sir William had sent to me from Castle Cumberland.</p>

<p>As I stood in the guard-room, eager, yet partly vexed, away below
in the village the bell in the new stone church began to ring.</p>

<p>"What is that?" I asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>The soldiers had all risen, taking their muskets from the racks,
straightening belts and bandoleers. In the stir and banging of
gun-stocks on the stone floor, my question perhaps was not heard
by Mr. Duncan, for he stood silent, untwisting his sword knots
and eying the line which the sergeant, who carried the halberd,
was forming in the room.</p>

<p>A drummer and a trumpeter took station, six paces to the right
and front; the sergeant, at a carry, advanced and saluted with,
"Parade is formed, sir."</p>

<p>"'Tention!" sang out Mr. Duncan. "Support arms! Carry arms! Trail
arms! File by the left flank! March!" And with drawn claymore
on his shoulder he passed out into the starlight.</p>

<p>I followed; and now, standing by the block-house gate, far away
in the village I heard the rub-a-dub of a drum and a loud trumpet
blowing.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the drum; the trumpet ceased. And now
I could hear the tramp, tramp, tramp of infantry on the hill's
black crest.</p>

<p>"Present arms!" cried Mr. Duncan, sharply.</p>

<p>A dark mass which I had not supposed to be moving, suddenly loomed
up close in front of us, taking the shape of a long column, which
passed with the flicker of starlight on musket and belt, tramp,
tramp, tramp to the ringing drum-beats.</p>

<p>Then our drum rattled and trumpet sang prettily, while Mr. Duncan
rendered the officer's salute as a dark stand of colours passed,
borne furled and high above the slanting muskets.</p>

<p>Baggage wains began to creak by, great shapeless hulks rolling
in on the black ocean of the night, with soldiers half asleep
on top, and teamsters afoot, heads hanging drowsily and looped
raw-hides trailing.</p>

<p>The last yoke of oxen passed, dragging a brass cannon.</p>

<p>"'Tention!" said Mr. Duncan. "Support arms! Trail arms! 'Bout
face! By the right flank, wheel! March!"</p>

<p>Back into the block-house filed the guard, the drummer bearing
his drum flat on his hip, the trumpeter swinging his instrument
to his shoulder-knots.</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan sent his claymore ringing into the scabbard, wrapped
his plaid around his throat, and strolled off towards the new
barracks, east of the Hall.</p>

<p>"What troops were those, sir?" I asked, respectfully.</p>

<p>"Three companies of Royal Americans from Albany," said he. Then,
noticing my puzzled face, he added, "There is to be a big council
fire held here, Master Cardigan. Did you not know it?"</p>

<p>"No," said I, slowly, reluctant to admit that I had not shared
Sir William's confidence.</p>

<p>"Look yonder," said Mr. Duncan.</p>

<p>Far out in the pale starlight, south and west of the Hall, I
saw fires kindled, one by one, until the twinkle of their lights
ran for a mile across the uplands. On a hill in the north a signal
fire sent long streamers of flame straight up into the sky; other
beacons flashed out in the darkness, some so distant that I could
not be certain they were more than sparks of my imagination.</p>

<p>"It is the Six Nations gathering," said Mr. Duncan. "We expect
important guests."</p>

<p>"What for?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mr. Duncan, gravely. "Good-night, Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>"Good-night, sir," I said, thoughtfully; then cried after him,
"and my present, Mr. Duncan?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he answered, and passed on his way a-laughing.</p>

<p>I walked quickly back to the Hall, where I encountered Esk and
Peter, well bibbed, cleaning the last crumb from their bowls of
porridge.</p>

<p>"Did you see the soldiers?" cried Esk, tapping upon his bowl
and marching up and down the hallway.</p>

<p>"Look out of the back windows," added Peter. "The Onondaga fires
are burning on the hills."</p>

<p>"Oneidas," corrected Esk.</p>

<p>"Onondagas," persisted Peter, smearing his face with his spoon
to lick it.</p>

<p>"Where is Silver Heels?" I asked.</p>

<p>Mistress Molly came into the hall from the pantry, keys jingling
at her girdle, and took Peter by his sticky fingers, bidding Esk
follow.</p>

<p>"Bed-time," she said, with her pretty smile. "Michael, Felicity
is being dressed by Betty. If Sir William does not return, you
will dine with Felicity alone; and I expect you to conduct exactly
like Sir William, and refrain from kicking under the table."</p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt Molly," said I, delighted.</p>

<p>Esk and Peter, being instantly hustled bedward, left lamenting
and asserting that they too were old enough to imitate Sir William.</p>

<p>Silver Heels, with her hair done by Betty, and a blue sash over
her fresh-flowered cambric, passed them on the stairs coming down,
pausing to wish Mistress Molly good-night, and to slyly pinch
fat Peter.</p>

<p>"Felicity," said Mistress Molly, "will you conduct as befits
your station?"</p>

<p>"Oh la, Aunt Molly!" she answered, with that innocent, affected
lisp which I knew was ever the forerunner of mischief.</p>

<p>She made her reverence, waiting on the landing until she heard
the nursery door close, then flung both legs astride the balustrade
and slid down like a flash.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the soldiers, Micky?&mdash;and the fires on the hills?"
she cried. "To-morrow all the officers will be here, and I am
to wear my hair curled, and my pink dress and tucker, with separate
sleeves of silver gauze!"</p>

<p>We sat down on the stairs together as friendly and polite as
though we never quarrelled; and she chattered on, smoothing her
bib-apron with those silky hands of hers: "Betty rolled up my
hair till I feared she meant to scalp me, and so told her.</p>

<p>"She coaxed me to endure, and called me her little Miss Honey-bee,
but would not promise me a comfit; so I ran away before my cap
was tied on. Micky, go and put on your silk breeches and lace
cuffs and we will be gay and grand to dine!"</p>

<p>I ran to my chamber, bathed and dressed in all my finery, meaning
to lord it in the dining-hall should Sir William not return.</p>

<p>And thus it fell out; for, when I descended the stairs, there
was my lady Silver Heels parading before the pier-glass, and a
gillie throwing open the doors of the dining-hall.</p>

<p>So that night Silver Heels and I supped alone together in the
great hall, Mr. Butler having hurriedly ridden to his home, and
Sir William not yet returned, though two hours past candle-light.</p>

<p>The hall was quiet and vast, and Silver Heels seemed exceedingly
small, sitting in the big chair at the other end of the table.
So I had the gillie lay her plate beside mine.</p>

<p>A single pair of candles lighted our supper, and those not of
the best, for they smoked as the wind stirred the curtains.</p>

<p>"Do you not know what is due to quality?" said I, sternly, to
the gillie&mdash;a raw yokel scented with whiffs of the stables.</p>

<p>The kilted oaf gaped at me.</p>

<p>"Do you not see it is dark here?" I said.</p>

<p>"'Tis far lichter than ye wud expeck for sae big a room, sir,"
said the gillie, with a foolish grin.</p>

<p>"Young Bareshanks," I retorted; "do you bring instantly a dozen
wax candles and light them, idiot, in a seemly row! Also fetch
Sir William's sherry and Madeira, and take away those pot-house
pewters!"</p>

<p>The gillie made out to do as he was bidden, and I should have
felt very grand and contented at being obeyed without questions
had I not perceived him, through the buttery window, wink at the
pantry-lad and put his mottled Scotch muzzle into my small-beer.</p>

<p>When the dozen waxen candles stood in a ring, all twinkling,
and the decanters flanked me right and left, I bade the gillie
leave us, mistrusting he might bear tales to Sir William touching
our behaviour at table. But the dunce loitered, trimming wicks,
and casting sidewise looks at me.</p>

<p>"Will you be gone?" said I, in a passion.</p>

<p>"Maister Michael," he whined; "ye'll no be soopin' till the blessing's
said? Sir William gave us a grand discoorse this noon dinner,
sir, verra suitable words, sir."</p>

<p>Mortified at my forgetfulness, I rose; so did Silver Heels, the
candle-light sparkling under her half-closed lashes, for she ever
kept one eye on duty.</p>

<p>In a rage I said grace before meat, then glared at the gillie.</p>

<p>"Aave heerd waur, sir," quoth he; "but aa never sleep the nicht
without ma blessing, and aa'l no begin noo!"</p>

<p>"Get out, you Scotch loon," said I, "or I'll let this bottle
fly with my blessing!"</p>

<p>He ran for it, at which Silver Heels and I laughed heartily until
she spilled her wine on her knees, which spoiled her temper.</p>

<p>When the echoing of our laughter had died away in the dark corners
of the room, an unaccustomed depression fell upon me. I peered
up at the stags' shaggy heads, set around the wall; their dark
glazed eyes reflected the little candle flames like fiery eyeballs
of living bucks. The stillness in the familiar room troubled me.</p>

<p>Something of this Silver Heels also experienced, but the novelty
of playing the grand lady with her sherry and her tea set her
tongue a-swinging, clip-clap! She shrugged her shoulders and tossed
her chin, pretending to trifle with a dish of cakes, vowing she
had no appetite; but her hunger could not long withstand the pastry,
and she ate all the suckets and cakes before I either perceived
or prevented it.</p>

<p>Distressed at her greediness, I removed the caraways from the
plate and pouched them to eat at my pleasure, whereupon she kicked
my shins under the table.</p>

<p>But she would still play my Lady Languish, sighing and protesting
she could not touch another morsel, and her cheeks full the while.
Too, she drank of both sherry and Madeira, which was forbidden
by Sir William, and became over-loud in speech until her humour
changed to a fit of upbraiding me, and ended in the sulks.</p>

<p>I remember we had a brandied syrup, of which she also took too
much, it making her pettish and sleepy; and after supper, when
we sat together on the stairs, she harped ever on the same string,
reproaching me for playing the high and mighty, whereas all could
plainly see I was nothing but a boy like Esk and Peter and need
give myself no plumes.</p>

<p>"My legs," she said, drowsily, "can touch the floor from the
third stair as well as yours;" and she stretched them down to
prove it, falling short an inch.</p>

<p>"If you are no longer a child," said I, "why do they harness
you to the back-board and make you wear pack-thread stays?"</p>

<p>This madded her.</p>

<p>"You shall see," she said, in a temper, "you shall see me in
flowered caushets, silk stockings, and shoes of Paddington's make,
which befit my station and rank! You shall see me in padusoy and
ribbons and a hat of gauze! I shall wear pompadour gloves and
shall take no notice of you, with your big hands and feet, pardieu!"</p>

<p>"Nor I of you," said I, "tricked out in your silly flummery."
And I drew a caraway from my pocket and bit deep.</p>

<p>"Yes, you will," said Silver Heels; "give me a caraway, piggy."</p>

<p>Sitting there in the dark, nibbling in silence, I could hear
the distant stir of the convoy at the barracks, and wondered why
the soldiers had come. Surely not because of danger to us at the
Hall, for we had our Mohawks, our militia, and yeoman tenantry
at beck and call. Besides, who would dare threaten Sir William
Johnson, the greatest man in the colonies, and very dearly esteemed
by our King?</p>

<p>"They say," said Silver Heels, "that there are men in Boston
who have even defied the King himself."</p>

<p>"Never fear," said I, "they'll all hang for it."</p>

<p>"Would you like to fight for the King?" she asked, civilly, and
without a trace of that mockery which left a sting, much as I
pretended to despise it.</p>

<p>I said I should like to very much; that my father had died for
his King, and that I should one day avenge him.</p>

<p>I would have said more, perhaps boasted, for Silver Heels was
inclined to listen; but black Betty came down-stairs, her double
ear-rings a-jingle, calling her "li'l Miss Honey-bee" to come
to bed.</p>

<p>Silver Heels stood up, rubbing her eyes and stretching. I could
not help noticing that she seemed to be growing very tall.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Micky," she said, with her mechanical curtsey, and
took Betty's black hand.</p>

<p>Although there was now nobody to bid me retire, I went to my
chamber gladly, for, what with the excitement of the morning,
the arrival of the Cayuga, and, later, the soldiers&mdash;and also,
I think, Sir William's sherry&mdash;my head was tired and confused.</p>

<p>I slept none too soundly. Dreams came crowding around my pillow;
visions of Mr. Butler chasing Silver Heels awoke me.</p>

<p>I sat up in my bed and parted the curtains. Through the window
I could see the watchful eyes of Indian fires glimmering from
hill and hollow, and over all the little stars, all awake, watching
the sleeping world.</p>

<p>A cock began crowing somewhere down in the village, although
no tint of dawn appeared. But the crickets had ceased, and the
stars grew paler, and that silence which is the dawn's true herald
warned me to sleep again ere the red sun should steal over the
edge of the world and catch me waking.</p>

<p>Then I slept soundly, and the sly sun had painted many a figure
on my walls ere I waked to hear the bugle playing at the barracks,
and Sir William's hounds baying in their kennels.</p>

<p>Dub! dub! rub-a-dub-dub! Dub! dub! rub-a-dub-dub!</p>

<p>The guard was changing at the block-house, while I, all shivers,
dashed cold water over me from head to foot and rubbed my limbs
into a tingle.</p>

<p>How sweetly came the matins of the robins! A kennel-lad, standing
in the sunshine by the stables, wound his hunting-horn till the
deep-jowled hounds drowned all with their baying.</p>

<p>In breeches and shirt I leaned from the open window to smell
the young year, and saw Silver Heels's head at the next window,
her hair in her eyes, and bare arms propping her chin.</p>

<p>She put out her tongue at me, but I bade her good-morning so
civilly that she smiled and asked me if I had slept well.</p>

<p>"No," said I; "dreams disturbed me."</p>

<p>"It was the cakes and sherry," she observed, with a grimace.</p>

<p>"I also dreamed, and screamed until Betty came and rocked me
in her arms. Which proves," she added, "that we are both too young
to dine and wine imprudently. I am coming in to tell you what
I dreamed. Open the door."</p>

<p>She entered, bundled in a wool blanket, and sat cross-legged
on the bed, chattering of her dreams, how, in her sleep, she saw
me mammocked by savages, among them Peter, who had grown big and
sly and fierce like a fat bear cub in December.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I made of my hair a neat queue and tied it; then put
on my buckskin vest with flaps, and my short hunting-shirt over
it.</p>

<p>"Are you going to fish?" asked Silver Heels, enviously.</p>

<p>"If Sir William does," said I. "He sent me a present from Castle
Cumberland last night. I doubt not that it may be a new fish-rod
for salmon."</p>

<p>Presently she went away to be dressed by Betty, and I hastened
down the stairs, impatient to find Mr. Duncan and have my present;
nay, so fast and blindly did I speed that, swinging around the
balustrade, I plumped clean into Sir William, coming up.</p>

<p>"What's to do! What's to do!" he exclaimed, testily. "Is there
no gout in the world, then, wooden feet!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir William! My present from Castle Cumberland!" I stammered.
"Is it a salmon-rod?"</p>

<p>"Now the wraith of old Isaac pinch ye!" said Sir William, half
laughing, half angry. "What the devil have I to do with your presents
and your fish-rods? Presents! Gad! It's a new algebra you need!"</p>

<p>"You promised not to," said I, stoutly.</p>

<p>"Did I?" said Sir William, with a twinkle in his eyes. "So I
did, lad; so I did! Well, perhaps it is not an algebra book after
all."</p>

<p>"Then let us go to Mr. Duncan and get it now," I replied, promptly.</p>

<p>"You may not want my present when you see it," argued Sir William,
who did ever enjoy to plague those whom he loved best.</p>

<p>But I pulled him by the hand, and he pretended to go with reluctance
and many misgivings.</p>

<p>At the door of the north block-house, Mr. Duncan rendered Sir
William the officer's salute, which Sir William returned.</p>

<p>"Mr. Duncan," said he, "have you knowledge hereabouts of a certain
present sent in your care for Mr. Cardigan here?"</p>

<p>"Now that you mention it, sir," replied Mr. Duncan, gravely,
"I do dimly recall something of the sort."</p>

<p>"Was it not a school-book?" inquired Sir William.</p>

<p>"It was a parcel," replied Mr. Duncan, dubiously; "belike it
hid a dozen good stout Latin books, sir."</p>

<p>I endured their plaguing with rising excitement. What could my
present be?</p>

<p>"Take him in, Mr. Duncan," said Sir William at last. "And," to
me, "remember, sir, that you forget not your manners when you
return to me, for I shall await you here at the door."</p>

<p>Cramping with curiosity, I followed Mr. Duncan into his own private
chamber, which connected with the guard-room. But I saw no parcels
anywhere; in fact, there was nothing to be noticed save an officer's
valise at the foot of Mr. Duncan's bed.</p>

<p>"It is for you," he said; "open it."</p>

<p>At the same moment I perceived my own name painted on the leather
side, and the next instant I had stripped the lid back. Buff and
gold and scarlet swam the colours of the clothing before my amazed
eyes; I put out a trembling hand and drew an officer's vest from
the valise.</p>

<p>"Here are the boots, Mr. Cardigan," said the lieutenant, lifting
a pair of dress boots from behind a curtain. "Here is the hat
and sword, too, and a holster with pistols."</p>

<p>"Mine!" I gasped.</p>

<p>"By this commission of our Governor," said Mr. Duncan, solemnly,
drawing from his breast a parchment with seal and tape. "Mr. Cardigan,
let me be the first to welcome you as a brother officer."</p>

<p>I had gone so blind with happy tears that I scarce could find
his kind, warm hand outstretched, nor could I decipher the commission
as cornet of horse in the Royal Border Regiment of irregulars.</p>

<p>He mercifully left me then, and I stood with head pinched in
my fingers, striving to realize what had arrived to me.</p>

<p>But I did not tarry long to gape and devour my uniform with my
eyes. One after another my hunting-shirt, vest, leggings, shoon,
flew from me. I pulled on the buff breeches, and laced them tight,
drew on the boots, set the vest close and buttoned it, then put
on coat and hat, and lastly tied my silver gorget.</p>

<p>What I could see of myself in Mr. Duncan's glass left me dazed
with admiration. I set my sword belt, hung the sword with one
glove in the hilt, and so, walking on air, I passed the guard-room
with all the soldiers at stiff attention, and came to Sir William.</p>

<p>He looked up sharply, without the familiar smile. But my wits
were at work and I stopped short at three paces, heels together,
and gave the officer's salute.</p>

<p>Sir William's lips twitched as he rendered the salute, then,
casting his ivory cane on the grass, he stepped forward with arms
outstretched, and I fell into them like a blubbering schoolboy.</p>

<p>To those contented and peaceful people who have never known that
gnawing desire for the noblest of all professions, the soldier's,
I can only say that I was contented. To those who themselves have
known the longing it is needless to describe my happiness and
pride, my gratitude to those who had honoured me, my impetuous
thirst for service, my resolve to set heart and soul towards high
ideals and thoughts, my solemn boyish prayers that I might conduct
nobly in the eyes of all men, for God and King and country.</p>

<p>Something of my thoughts may have disclosed themselves in my
face as Sir William laid both hands on my shoulders, for he looked
at me a long while with kindly, steady eyes. His countenance was
serene and benign when he spoke in that clear voice whose harmony
and perfect cadence has charmed a thousand council fires, and
turned feverish spleen and hatred into forbearance and reconciliation.</p>

<p>"My boy," he said, "the key to it all is faith. Keep faith with
all men; keep faith with thyself. This wins all battles, even
the greatest and last!"</p>

<p>Very soberly we returned to the Hall, where a small company were
assembled for breakfast &mdash;Mistress Molly, Major Wilkes of
the battalion which arrived the night before, Captains Priestly,
Borrow, and McNeil, of the same regiment, my friend Lieutenant
Duncan of the militia, and Silver Heels.</p>

<p>When Sir William and I entered the Hall the officers came to
pay their respects to the Baronet, and I, red as a Dutch pippin,
crossed the room to where Mistress Molly stood with Silver Heels.</p>

<p>Bending to salute her hand, cocked hat crushed under one arm,
I discharged my duties with what composure I could command; but
Mistress Molly put both arms around me and kissed me on both cheeks.</p>

<p>"I knew all about it," she whispered. "We are very proud, Sir
William and I. Be tender and faithful. It is all we ask."</p>

<p>Dear, dear Aunt Molly! While life lasts can I ever forget those
sweet, grave words of love, spoken to a boy who stood alone on
the threshold of life?</p>

<p>Slowly I turned to look at Silver Heels, all my vanity, conceit,
and condescension vanished.</p>

<p>She had turned quite pale; her eyes seemed set and fascinated,
and she wished me happiness in a low voice, as though uncertain
of her own words.</p>

<p>Chilled by her lifeless greeting, I returned to Sir William,
who presented me to the guests with unconcealed pride:</p>

<p>"My kinsman, Mr. Cardigan, gentlemen; Captain Cardigan's only
son!"</p>

<p>The officers, all in full dress, brilliant with the red, green,
and gold of the Royal Americans, greeted me most kindly, some
claiming acquaintance with my honoured father, and all speaking
of his noble death before Quebec.</p>

<p>Before we sat at table, they gave me a standing toast, all touching
glasses with me, and Sir William, smiling, with one arm around
my shoulder.</p>

<p>So we sat down to breakfast, a breakfast I, being excited, scarcely
tasted; but I listened with all my ears to the discourse touching
the late troubles in New York and Massachusetts, concerning the
importation of tea by the East India Company. The discussion soon
became a monologue, for the subject was one which Sir William
understood from A to Zed, and his eloquence upon it had amazed
and irritated people of more importance than our Governor Tryon
himself.</p>

<p>"Look you," said Sir William, in his clear voice like a bell;
"look you, gentlemen; I yield to no man in loyalty and love to
my King; but this I know and dare maintain here or at St. James:
that his Majesty whom I serve and honour is misled by his ministers,
and neither he nor they suspect the truth concerning these colonies!"</p>

<p>The officers were all attention, some leaning forward to lose
no word or inflection; Mistress Molly poured the roundly abused
tea, and her gentle dark eyes ever stole proudly towards Sir William.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Sir William, blandly, "you all are aware that
since last December the Atlantic Ocean is become but a vast pot
of cold tea."</p>

<p>The laughter which followed sounded to me a trifle strained,
as well it might be, considering the insolence of the people who
had flung this defiance into the King's ocean.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Sir William, with that tight crease running
around his jaw which meant his mind was made up. "This is the
true history of that trouble, gentlemen. Judge for yourselves
where lies the blame." And, leaning back in his chair, one hand
lifted, he began:</p>

<p>"That damned East India Company, floundering about with the non-importation
pill in its gullet, found itself owing the government fourteen
hundred thousand pounds, with seventeen million pounds of unsold
tea on its hands.</p>

<p>"Nobody likes bankruptcy, so off go the East India gentlemen
with their petition to Parliament for permission to export their
tea to America, free of duty, and so put it in the power of the
company to sell tea here cheaper than in England. And now I ask
you, gentlemen, whether in all these broad colonies there are
not some few men whose motives are other than sordid?</p>

<p>"Your answers must be 'yes!'&mdash;because the colonists themselves
so answered when they burned the <em>Gaspee</em>!&mdash;when they gathered
at Griffin's wharf and made tea enough for the world to drink!&mdash;when
John Lamb set his back to the portcullis of the fort and the tea
commissioners ran like rabbits!</p>

<p>"God forbid that I, a humble loyal subject of my King, should
ever bear out the work of rebels or traitors. But I solemnly say
to you that the rebels and traitors are not the counterfeit Indians
of Griffin's wharf, not the men who fired the <em>Gaspee</em>
aflame from sprit to topmast, not that man who set his back to
the fort in New York! But they are those who whisper evil to my
King at St. James&mdash;and may God have mercy on their souls!"</p>

<p>In the silence which followed, Sir William leaned forward, his
heavy chin set on his fists, his eyes looking into the future
which he alone saw so clearly.</p>

<p>None durst interrupt him. The officers watched him silently&mdash;this
great man&mdash;this great Irishman who had been the sole architect
of his own greatness; this great American who saw what we, even
now, cannot see as clearly as did he.</p>

<p>There he sat, dumb, eyes on vacancy; a plain man, a Baronet of
the British realm, a member of the King's Council, a major-general
of militia, and the superintendent of the Indian Department in
North America.</p>

<p>A plain man; but a vast land-holder, the one man in America trusted
blindly by the Indians, a man whose influence was enormous; a
man who was as simple as a maid, as truthful as a child, as kind
as the Samaritan who passed not on the other side.</p>

<p>A plain man, but a prophet.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>There was a step at the door; Mr. Duncan spoke in a low tone
with the orderly, then returned to Sir William.</p>

<p>"The Indian belt-bearer is at the block-house, sir," he said.</p>

<p>Sir William rose. The officers made their adieux and left. Only
Sir William, Mistress Molly, Silver Heels, and I remained in the
dining-hall.</p>

<p>The Baronet looked across at Mistress Molly, and a sad smile
