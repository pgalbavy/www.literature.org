<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>LAUNA’S first feeling was relief, relief—so intense, so endless, that
she felt buoyant, joyful, secure. But after some days she felt shame.
What had Hugh Wainbridge thought of her? What could a man think of a
woman whom he could propose to wrong so terribly? And what had Paul
thought of her? Why did he not come?
</p>
<p>Why should she think he cared still? She had no reason to think so.
Doubt, misery, and loneliness, became torturing demons; in action she
saw the only relief possible, and then she remembered Canada,
“Solitude,” the woods, the shore. Paul despised her, she was sure; she
would go away, go home.
</p><p>The penetrating depressing autumn mist was slowly making its way over
the land, it was almost rain, it was so thick, and far more wetting. The
river was shrouded in a white ghostly mantle. She thought of the keen
air at “Solitude,” of the clear sky, and of the shore with the far-away
landscape, mysterious and, always to her, enticing. And then of the
storms, howling, fierce, and powerful, like the terrible force and
presence of an unseen mighty power, the devastating Great Spirit of the
North who, for five months of the year, reigns supreme, who is real,
tangible, brutal, unlike the horrible slowness of this climate.
</p><p>“Solitude” was empty, Launa cabled to the gardener’s wife who inhabited
a lodge, and who once had been housekeeper.
</p><p>When Paul got her letter, she and her maid were out on the Atlantic,
rapidly going farther away.
</p><p>Launa was beginning to forget the Wainbridge incident, though at first
her anger had seemed unending.
</p><p>The weather became very cold as they neared Halifax. The big blue
harbour, with its white-capped waves and white-covered shores, was home.
The drifting bits of ice were gaily rushing on, tossed by the waves, the
tide, and the wash of the big steamer. The decks and rigging were
covered with ice, the sea had swept the ship, and, after sweeping it,
the frost demon bound everything in his cold arms. She wondered how she
had existed so long in that grey land without sun. The sky looked higher
and more deeply blue.
</p><p>“Solitude” was quite ready for her, huge fires blazed everywhere, old
servants had come back. She drove ten miles from the nearest station,
how the sleigh runners creaked, and the bells rang clear, a big yellow
moon was up before she arrived; everything was so strong, so intense, so
cold.
</p><p>“Solitude” was lonely. She spent the greater part of the days out of
doors. She was young, and the horribleness of Mr. Wainbridge’s behaviour
became dimmer. She had only been angry, how would she have felt if she
had loved him?
</p><p>After a week of driving and snowshoeing she got out her toboggan.
</p><p>The land from “Solitude” to the Bay sloped down for about half a mile,
and then the Bay was frozen, the ice covered with snow, and she could
toboggan straight across it. The crust of the snow was very hard. The
toboggan started slowly, then went faster, faster, little bits of crisp
snow flew in her face, the air whistled past her as she rushed along,
the pace became swifter,—it was glorious: the sun, the air, and the
clear blue sky were life-giving as she tore on. The toboggan bounded
over the rough blocks of ice on the edge of the Bay which were broken by
the tide. On the flat stretch of ice it began to move more slowly and
then stopped. It was splendid. She spent all the afternoon at it; the
thermometer was ten below zero, but it was so still and sunny that she
could not feel cold.
</p><p>It was snowing hard and blowing from the north-east; the view from
“Solitude” was dim, whirling snow hurled by the wind, little drifting
eddies of snow curled round the top of the drifts already forming
quickly.
</p><p>Launa started on snowshoes. The wind knocked her about and she staggered
before it. She waited in the shelter of the porch until the fury of the
blast seemed to have swept past, then she went on again. The snow was
loose, and the walking, even on snowshoes, very heavy. She struggled to
the little post-office, though there was no need for this, for they
would have sent up her letters; the one she wanted was not there. She
wandered on in the storm to pass the time hoping to grow very tired. The
road was gone, it had disappeared in a level plain of snow, only like
black specks occasional stones showed up in the walls. The snow drifted
and whirled, and the wind was so keen and cold, like knives, with a
stinging burning sensation. The snow made its way under her big fur
collar and chilled her neck and face though she was so hot.
</p><p>Suddenly she saw a dark figure coming nearer. It was a man.
“Good-night,” she said as they passed. She doubted if he could hear, the
wind crashed by them, it roared over their heads and howled behind them.
</p><p>The man turned, and with two steps towards her, said:
</p><p>“Launa, darling!”
</p><p>He put his arms round her, and then walked on her snowshoes, nearly
knocking her over, and Launa lay in his arms; her feet were most
uncomfortable, one snowshoe was on its side.
</p><p>“Paul!” she gasped.
</p><p>His thick blanket coat against her mouth prevented conversation.
</p><p>“Come back to ‘Solitude,’” he said; “it is too cold and too stormy for
you to be out.”
</p><p>He took her hand, and they trudged on for the greater part of the way in
silence; it was too windy to talk, and neither knew when the other spoke
unless their heads were close together.
</p><p>At “Solitude” Paul undid her snowshoes and his own, then they went into
the hall, all bright with a huge fire and flowers. Paul put his arms
round her and kissed her. She was covered with snow.
</p><p>“I must go. Let me go, Paul; you will stay. There are things you can put
on in the dressing-room; but I must get them for you. I want to tell you
about him.”
</p><p>“I don’t want to know anything. He was a beast; you are mine now. I am
not wet, Launa; you have forgotten the snow is dry. Even Mrs. Grundy
could not turn a man out on a dark night, with the thermometer at zero
and a gale blowing.”
</p><p>When she came down he was waiting. He came towards her. She loved him,
he loved her; was there anything in the world she needed now?
</p><p>He put his arms round her.
</p><p>“You have forgiven me?” he said, and he kissed her.
</p><p>“Paul, you won’t hate me?”
</p><p>“Probably I shall. Tell me why?”
</p><p>“Well, you know I do not like—much kissing.”
</p><p>“I have observed that with regret, or rather I hear you say it with
sorrow; for since I came I have kissed you several times and you—”
</p><p>“Yes,” she interrupted, “but do you not think we had better be careful?
It might get—common, we might grow accustomed to it, and not—like it
as much.”
</p><p>Paul laughed.
</p><p>“Oh, Launa!”
</p><p>“Tell me how you got here?” she asked. They were sitting by the
tea-table. “The roads are blocked, and it snowed all night as well as
to-day.”
</p><p>“Changing the subject rapidly was always one of your accomplishments.
Kissing and roads—I see the connection to you.”
</p><p>“Paul!”
</p><p>“I started to drive,” he answered. “At last we stuck in a drift near
Montague’s; so I came on snowshoes.”
</p><p>“It was a dreadful tramp.”
</p><p>“It was the best I ever had—with you at the end of it. I wonder if you
will ever know? How soon will you marry me? I cannot stay at ‘Solitude,’
and fifteen miles is too far apart for you and me.”
</p><p>“You never came back! You never wrote to me at ‘Shelton.’ I thought you
did not care—that you despised me, and thought me a beast.”
</p><p>“And you? You were going to marry someone else. I tried to stop you—”
</p><p>“I believe I was going to run away the day of the wedding,” she said.
“Wasn’t it ghastly?”
</p><p>“Awful,” he said briefly. “Sylvia has promised to marry the Member for
Hackney. Did she write to you?”
</p><p>“No. She will marry Lord Fairmouth? Ugh! how can she? Is it true?”
</p><p>“You will marry me soon,” he said. “And we will go—where shall we go?”
</p><p>“We shall stay here until the spring, and then go up to the North,” she
answered. “I am glad we are ‘born Canadian.’ Aren’t you?”
</p><p>And Paul kissed her.

                     <u>A few early Press Opinions</u>:—</pre>
<p>=DAILY TELEGRAPH.=—“It is vivid and strong, touched with that
picturesque, vigorous fancy with which intellect illuminates and
interprets the life of action. . . . Mr. Bart Kennedy has talent of a
strong order: He shows it clearly in this latest book, in the strength
with which he puts these scenes before us, in his power of conveying his
impressions, and his picturesque point of view. No one can read this
tramp’s reminiscences without adding to his knowledge of human nature,
and to his comprehension of a somewhat unknown walk of life.”
</p><p>=ACADEMY.=—“The rough-and-ready, unvarnished, straightforward narrative
of a rover about the World, living from hand to mouth, getting down on
his luck, running strange risks, and meeting picturesque wastrels.”
</p><p>=SCOTSMAN.=—“The book is fascinating, and is written with a force which
seems born of sincerity, without any sensationalism. It cannot fail to
interest readers.”
</p><p>=MORNING LEADER.=—“The record of an adventurous life, when well told,
always appeals to the imagination and sympathy of the reader, and ‘A Man
Adrift’ is such a record. Presumably the adventures are real; they have
all the vividness of reality at all events, and one follows the
hardships and wanderings of the narrator with keen interest. . . . Mr.
Kennedy is to be congratulated on his ‘Man Adrift.’”
</p><p>=TO-DAY.=—“I have discovered in ‘A Man Adrift’ one of the most
remarkable autobiographies ever penned. There is on every one of the
incidents the stamp of reality. There does not appear to be a page of
fiction in the book, and in his devil-may-care language the author
secures the effect of absolute truth.”
</p><p>=UNIVERSE.=—“This is really one of the best books we have had the
pleasure to read for a long time. . . . The author evidently understands
what he is writing about, and the whole is so beautifully written, that
as the reader scans the pages the various scenes treated of are brought
in a vivid manner before the mind.”
</p><p>=REVIEW OF THE WEEK.=—“Each chapter is vivid with actuality. The book
is interesting by reason of its absolute sincerity, and the strange
quaint phases of life in out-of-the-way places, with which it deals. Mr.
Kennedy’s style is peculiarly his own, and we are not prepared to
contest its effectiveness. His story of the power of the human eye in
obtaining a free lunch is altogether admirable. This is a book which
should be widely read, and few will lay it down before the last page has
been scanned.”

                Crown 8vo, Cloth, Top Edge Gilt, =2/6=.</pre>
<p>=OUTLOOK.=—“Good work in which the influence of Mr. Saltus is
perceptible. There are whole pages of admirable rhetoric. The story
illustrates the enormous power of woman to excite and obsess man—an old
theme, but an inexhaustible one.”
</p><p>=SHEFFIELD TELEGRAPH.=—“A good half-crown’s worth of smart clever
writing. Both stories are quite off the conventional line.”
</p><p>=ST. PAUL’S.=—“The dialogue in ‘My Lady Ruby’ is crisp and distinctly
good. The second story, ‘John Basileon,’ is very striking.”
</p><p>=ST. JAMES’ BUDGET.=—“‘My Lady Ruby’ is a dainty trifle, of the genre
made familiar by Anthony Hope, wittily and gracefully told. . . . ‘John
Basileon’ is a lurid story in which the senses run riot, and in one of
the chapters, ‘The Glory of the God of Sex,’ we have a phrase suggestive
of the outlook on life of practically all the characters engaged.”
</p><p>=WOMAN’S WEEKLY.=—“‘My Lady Ruby,’ by Mr. G. F. Monkshood, whose work
on Rudyard Kipling was so much appreciated, is a dainty little study of
a pair of lovers; the other story, ‘John Basileon,’ shows the author has
several styles, and while a less pleasant theme has a strength that one
cannot but admire.”
</p><p>=LIVERPOOL REVIEW.=—“‘My Lady Ruby’ is a little love story told in an
extremely unconventional fashion. Between the same covers is a short
lurid story of passion called ‘John Basileon,’ in which the moralities
are discussed in a very free and easy, and not altogether commendable,
style. Still Mr. Monkshood can write.”
</p><p>=MONITOR.=—“‘My Lady Ruby’ is charming, and as witty as she is
charming. . . . ‘John Basileon’ evinces imagination and subtlety of a
highly vivid and intense quality. The note of the book is modern, but of
a modernity far removed from that of the term understood by the French
Symbolists and the English Degenerates. Messrs. Greening &amp; Co. are to be
congratulated on a publication which is likely to arouse considerable
attention in those literary circles from which approbation is praise
indeed.”
</p><p>=NORTH BRITISH DAILY MAIL.=—“The titular story—one of two—displays a
lightness of touch and a deftness of construction that make its perusal
a source of keen mental stimulation, while the wit of its dialogue and
the gentle and kindly humour that permeates the whole of it serve to
increase and intensify the intellectual exhilaration, which every
cultured man who reads it, must feel. . . . The second tale, ‘John
Basileon,’ is of a different stamp. The language is strong, and its
suggestion ever stronger, and it displays a real power over the
emotional states, and an insight into the psychology of a man’s love,
seldom arrived at by writers of Fiction.”

Being a Series of Monographs on living Authors. Each volume is written
by a competent authority, and each subject is treated in an
appreciative, yet critical, manner. The following are the first volumes
in the Series:—
</p><p>_=Rudyard Kipling.=_ The Man and His Work. Being an attempt at an
“Appreciation.” By G. F. MONKSHOOD, Author of “Woman and The Wits,” “My
Lady Ruby,” etc. Containing a portrait of Mr Kipling and an autograph
letter to the author in facsimile. Second Impression. Crown 8vo,
buckram, gilt lettered, top edge gilt, 5s. nett.
</p><p>=Daily Telegraph.=—“He writes fluently, and he has genuine enthusiasm
for his subject, and an intimate acquaintance with his work. Moreover,
the book has been submitted to Mr Kipling, whose characteristic letter
to the author is set forth on the preface. . . . Of Kipling’s heroes Mr
Monkshood has a thorough understanding, and his remarks on them are
worth quoting” (extract follows).
</p><p>=Globe.=—“It has at the basis of it both knowledge and
enthusiasm—knowledge of the works estimated and enthusiasm for them.
This book may be accepted as a generous exposition of Mr Kipling’s
merits as a writer. We can well believe that it will have many
interested and approving readers.”
</p><p>=Scotsman.=—“This well-informed volume is plainly sincere. It is
thoroughly well studied, and takes pains to answer all the questions
that are usually put about Mr Kipling. The writer’s enthusiasm carries
both himself and his reader along in the most agreeable style. One way
and another his book is full of interest, and those who wish to talk
about Kipling will find it invaluable, while the thousands of his
admirers will read it through with delighted enthusiasm.”

Third Edition. Crown 8vo, crimson buckram, gilt lettered, gilt top, 2s.
</p><p>=Weekly Sun= (T. P. O’Connor) says:—A Book of the Week—“I have found
this slight and unpretentious little volume bright, interesting reading.
I have read nearly every line with pleasure.”
</p><p>=Illustrated London News.=—“The story Mr Scott has to tell is full of
varied interest, and is presented with warmth and buoyancy.”
</p><p>=Punch.=—“What pleasant memories does not Clement Scott’s little book,
‘The Wheel of Life,’ revive! The writer’s memory is good, his style
easy, and above all, which is a great thing for reminiscences, chatty.”
</p><p>=Referee.=—GEORGE R. SIMS (Dagonet) says:—Deeply interesting are these
last memories and recollections of the last days of Bohemia. . . . I
picked up ‘The Wheel of Life’ at one in the morning, after a hard
night’s work, and flung myself, weary and worn, into an easy-chair, to
glance at it while I smoked my last pipe. As I read, all my weariness
departed, for I was young and light-hearted once again, and the friends
of my young manhood had come trooping back from the shadows to make a
merry night of it once more in London town. And when I put the book
down, having read it from cover to cover, it was ‘past three o’clock and
a windy morning.’”
</p><p>_=A Trip to Paradoxia=_, and other Humours of the Hour. Being
Contemporary Pictures of Social Fact and Political Fiction. By T. H. S.
ESCOTT, Author of “Personal Forces of the Period,” “Social
Transformation of the Victorian Age,” “Platform, Press, Politics, and
Play,” Etc. Crown 8vo, art cloth. Gilt, 5s. nett.
</p><p>=Standard.=—“A book which is amusing from cover to cover. Bright
epigrams abound in Mr Escott’s satirical pictures of the modern
world. . . . Those who know the inner aspects of politics and society
will, undoubtedly, be the first to recognise the skill and adroitness
with which he strikes at the weak places in a world of intrigue and
fashion. . . . There is a great deal of very clever sword-play in Mr
Escott’s description of Dum-Dum (London), the capital of Paradoxia
(England).”
</p><p>=Court Circular.=—“It is brilliantly written, and will afford keen
enjoyment to the discriminating taste. Its satire is keen-edged, but
good-humoured enough to hurt no one; and its wit and (may me say?) its
impudence should cause a run on it at the libraries.”
</p><p>=M. A. P.=—“A sparkling piece of political and social satire. Mr Escott
besprinkles his pages with biting epigram and humorous innuendo. It is a
most amusing book.”
</p><p>=Athenæum.=—“He constantly suggests real episodes and real persons.
There are a good many rather pretty epigrams scattered through Mr
Escott’s pages.”
</p><p>=Scotsman.=—“A bright, witty, and amusing volume, which will entertain
everybody who takes it up.”
</p><p>=Newcastle Leader.=—“Messrs Greening are fortunate in being the
publishers of a volume so humorous, so dexterous, written with such
knowledge of men and affairs, and with such solidity and power of style
as Mr T. H. S. Escott’s ‘A Trip to Paradoxia.’”
</p><p>=Public Opinion.=—“Mr T. H. S. Escott throws abundant humour blended
with pungent sarcasm into his work, making his pictures very agreeable
reading to all but the victim he has selected, and whose weaknesses he
so skilfully lays bare. But the very clever manner in which the writer
hits the foibles and follies of his fellows must create admiration and
respect even from those who view his satire with a wintry smile. We like
his writing, his power of discernment, and his high literary style.”
</p><p>_=People, Plays, and Places.=_ Being the Second Series of “The Wheel of
Life,” Memories and Recollections of “People” I have met, “Plays” I have
seen, and “Places” I have visited. By CLEMENT SCOTT, Author of “The
Stage of Yesterday and The Stage of To-day,” “Pictures of the World,”
“Thirty Years at the Play.” Crown 8vo, cloth gilt. (In preparation.) 5s.
</p><p>“_=Sisters by the Sea.=_” Seaside and Country Sketches. By CLEMENT
SCOTT, Author of “Blossom Land,” “Amongst the Apple Orchards,” Etc.
Frontispiece and Vignette designed by GEORGE POWNALL. Long 12mo,
attractively bound in cloth, 1s.
</p><p>=Observer.=—“The little book is bright and readable, and will come like
a breath of country air to many unfortunates who are tied by the leg to
chair, stool, or counter.”
</p><p>=Sheffield Telegraph.=—“Bright, breezy, and altogether readable. . . .
East Anglia, Nelson’s Land, etc., etc., are all dealt with, and touched
lightly and daintily, as becomes a booklet meant to be slipped in the
pocket and read easily to the pleasing accompaniment of the waves lazily
lapping on the shingle by the shore.”
</p><p>=Dundee Advertiser.=—“It is all delightful, and almost as good as a
holiday. The city clerk, the jaded shopman, the weary milliner, the
pessimistic dyspeptic, should each read the book. It will bring a
suggestion of sea breezes, the plash of waves, and all the accessories
of a holiday by the sea.”
</p><p>_=Some Famous Hamlets.=_ (SARAH BERNHARDT, HENRY IRVING, BEERBOHM TREE,
WILSON BARRETT and FORBES ROBERTSON.) By CLEMENT SCOTT. Illustrated with
portraits. Crown 8vo, cloth, 2s. 6d.
</p><p>_=Some Bible Stories Retold.=_ By “A CHURCHMAN.” Crown 8vo, cloth, 3s.
6d.
</p><p>_=Bye-Ways of Crime.=_ With some Stories from the Black Museum. By R. J.
POWER-BERREY. Profusely Illustrated. Crown 8vo, cloth, 2s. 6d.
</p><p>=Outlook.=—“Decidedly you should read Mr Power-Berrey’s interesting
book, taking laugh and shudder as they come.”
</p><p>=Sheffield Independent.=—“We do not remember to have ever seen a more
popularly-written summary of the methods of thieves than this bright and
chatty volume. It is the work of a writer who evidently has a most
intimate knowledge of the criminal classes, and who can carry on a plain
narrative briskly and forcibly. The book fascinates by its freshness and
unusualness.”
</p><p>=Literature.=—“It contains many interesting stories and new
observations on the <u>modus operandi</u> of swindlers.”
</p><p>=Scotsman.=—“A most interesting account of the dodges adopted by
various criminals in effecting their purposes. The reader will find much
that is instructive within its pages.”
</p><p>=Liverpool Review.=—“This is no fanciful production, but a clear,
dispassionate revelation of the dodges of the professional criminal.
Illustrated by numerous pen and ink sketches, Mr Power-Berrey’s
excellent work is useful as well as interesting, for it will certainly
not assist the common pilferer to have all his little tricks made public
property in this lucid and easily rememberable style.”
</p><p>_=The Art of Elocution=_ and Public Speaking. By ROSS FERGUSON. With an
Introduction by GEO. ALEXANDER. Dedicated by permission to Miss ELLEN
TERRY. Second Edition. Crown 8vo, strongly bound in cloth, 1s.
</p><p>=Australian Mail.=—“A useful little book. We can strongly recommend it
to the chairmen of public companies.”
</p><p>=Stage.=—“A carefully composed treatise, obviously written by one as
having authority. Students will find it of great service.”
</p><p>=People’s Friend.=—“Contains many valuable hints, and deals with every
branch of the elocutionist’s art in a lucid and intelligible manner.”
</p><p>=Literary World.=—“The essentials of elocution are dealt with in a
thoroughly capable and practical way. The chapter on public speaking is
particularly satisfactory.”
</p><p>=Madame.=—“The work is pleasingly thorough. The instructions are most
interesting, and are lucidly expressed, physiological details are
carefully, yet not redundantly, dwelt on, so that the intending student
may have some very real and definite idea of what he is learning about,
and many valuable hints may be gleaned from the chapters on
‘Articulation and Modulation.’ Not only for actors and orators will this
little book be found of great service, but everyone may find pleasure
and profit in reading it.”
</p><p>_=The Path of the Soul.=_ Being Essays on Continental Art and
Literature. By S. C. de SOISSONS, Author of “A Parisian in America,”
etc. Illustrated with portraits, etc. Crown 8vo, cloth gilt, 10s. 6d.
</p><p>_=A History of Nursery Rhymes.=_ By =Percy B. Green=. This
interesting Book is the result of many years research among nursery
folklore of all nations, and traces the origin of nursery-rhymes from
the earliest times. Crown 8vo, cloth, 4s.
</p><p>_=The Year Book of the Stage.=_ Being an annual record of criticisms of
all the important productions of the English Stage, with copious Index
and complete Casts of each Play recorded. A useful compilation for
students of the Drama. About 260 pages, strongly bound in cloth, 3s. 6d.
</p><p>_=In Quaint East Anglia.=_ Descriptive Sketches. By T. WEST CARNIE.
Illustrated by W. S. ROGERS. Long 12mo, cloth, 1s.
</p><p>=Observer.=—“That East Anglia exercises a very potent spell over those
who once come under its influence is proved by the case of George
Borrow, and all who share in the fascination will delight in this
brightly written, companionable little volume.”

</p><p>=Sun.=—“Mr Longstaff has real fire and passion in all of his work. He
has a graceful touch and a tuneful ear. There is exquisite melody in his
metre.”
</p><p>=Echo.=—“The poetry of passion is no rarity to-day, yet scarcely since
the date of Philip Bourke Marston’s ‘Song Tide’ has such an arresting
and whole-hearted example of this class of poetry been issued by any
English author as the volume which Mr William Luther Longstaff entitles
‘Weeds and Flowers.’ Passion, tumultuous and unabashed, sensuous rapture
openly flaunting its shame, love in maddest surrender risking all,
daring all, these are the dominant motives of Mr Longstaff’s muse. So
wild is the rush of his emotion—all storm and fire and blood—to such
white heat does he forge his burning phrases, so subtly varied are the
constantly recurring expressions of love’s ecstasy, its despair, its
bereavement, its appetite, its scorn, so happy sometimes are the
unexpected metrical changes and experiments herein adopted, that the
younger poet might suggest discreet comparisons with the earlier
Swinburne.”
</p><p>=Morning Herald.=—“The book contains <u>real</u> poetry. There is always
thought and force in the work. ‘At the Gate’ is not merely Swinburnian
in metre; in all things it might well have come from that poet’s pen.”

</p><p>=Scotsman.=—“The plot is bold, even to audacity; its development is
always interesting, picturesque, and, towards the close, deeply
pathetic; and the purpose and method of the writer are alike admirable.”
</p><p>=Eastern Morning News.=—“It is a clever book, splendidly written, and
striking in its wonderful power, and keeping the reader
interested. . . . The author has not failed in his effort to prove the
case. The awful truth of its pages is borne home upon us as we read
chapter after chapter. The book should have a good effect in certain
quarters. One of the best features is the dividing line drawn most
plainly between Socialism and Anarchism. To its author we tender our
thanks, and predict a large sale.”
</p><p>=Daily Telegraph.=—“The hero is an interesting dreamer, absorbed in his
schemes, which are his one weakness. To women, save when they can
further the good of his cause, he is obdurate; in business, strong,
energetic, and powerful. He is shown to us as the man with a master mind
and one absorbing delusion, and as such is a pathetic figure. No one can
dispute the prodigality and liveliness of the author’s imagination; his
plot teems with striking incidents.”
</p><p>=Vanity Fair.=—“The story tells itself very clearly in three hundred
pages of very pleasant and entertaining reading. The men and women we
meet are not the men and women we really come across in this world. So
much the better for us. But we are delighted to read about them, for all
that; and we prophesy success for Mr Ascher’s book, particularly as he
has taken the precaution of telling us that he is ‘only in fun.’”
</p><p>=Aberdeen Free Press.=—“A story in which there is not a dull page, nay,
not even a dull line. The characters are well drawn, the incidents are
novel and often astounding, and the language has a terseness and
briskness that gives a character of vivacity to the story, so that the
reader is never tired going on unravelling the tangled meshes of the
intricate plot until he comes to the end. ‘A Social Upheaval’ is,
indeed, a rattling good book.”

“Eagle Joe,” “Scarlet Fortune,” etc., and Joint Author of the “Silver
King,” “Claudian.” Crown 8vo, art cloth, 3s. 6d.
</p><p>=Vanity Fair.=—“The hand that wrote the ‘Silver King’ has by no means
lost its cunning in painting broad effects of light and shadow. The
description of life in Broadmoor is, we fancy, done from actual
observation. It is quite new.” And the critic of =Black and White= sums
it up pithily as “a story which holds our attention and interests us
right from the first chapter. The book is as exciting as even a story of
sensation has any need to be.” Speaking of the scene of Mr Herman’s
drama, the beautiful county of Devonshire, where the greater part of the
story takes place, the =Manchester Courier= says: “The author’s
descriptive powers vividly portray the lovely spots by the winding
Tamar, while the rich dialect of the district is so faithfully
reproduced as to become not the least feature of an exciting tale.”
</p><p>=The Weekly Mercury.=—“Mr Henry Herman has carefully studied the little
weaknesses of the great army of readers. Like a celebrated and much
advertised medicine, he invariably ‘touches the spot,’ and hence the
popularity of his works. His latest novel, ‘The Sword of Fate,’ contains
all the essentials of a popular story. It is well written, sufficiently
dramatic, full of life and incident, and above all, right triumphs over
wrong. We must, too, congratulate the author upon the omission of all
that is disagreeable or likely to offend the susceptibilities of the
most delicate minded. It is a clean and healthy novel, a credit to the
writer, and a pleasure to the reader. . . . These are quite capable of
affording anyone a pleasant evening’s reading, a remark which does not
apply to the great majority of the modern novels.”
</p><p>_=Seven Nights with Satan.=_ A Novel. By =J. L. Owen=, Author
of “The Great Jekyll Diamond.” Cover designed by W. S. ROGERS. Crown
8vo, cloth, 3s. 6d.
</p><p>=St James’s Gazette.=—“We have read the book from start to finish with
unflagging interest—an interest, by the way, which derives nothing from
the ‘spice,’ for though its title may be suggestive of Zolaism, there is
not a single passage which is open to objection. The literary style is
good.”
</p><p>=Truth.=—“I much prefer the ghastly story ‘Seven Nights with Satan,’ a
very clever study of degeneration.”
</p><p>=London Morning.=—“The story told is a powerful one, evidently based
upon close personal knowledge of the events, places, and persons which
figure in it. A tragic note pervades it, but still there is lightness
and wit in its manner which makes the book a very fascinating as well as
eventful volume.”
</p><p>=Public Opinion.=—“Mr J. L. Owen has given a title to his work which
will cause many conjectures as to the nature of the story. Now, if we
divulged what were the seven nights, we should be doing the author
anything but a service—in fact, we should be giving the whole thing
away; therefore, we will only state that the work is cleverly conceived,
and carried out with great literary ability. There are numerous flashes
of originality that lift the author above ordinary commonplace.”
</p><p>_=The Green Passion.=_ The Study of a Jealous Soul. A Powerful Novel. By
ANTHONY P. VERT. Cover designed by ALFRED PRAGA. Crown 8vo, art cloth,
3s. 6d.
</p><p>Mr. DOUGLAS SLADEN in =The Queen=.—“A remarkably clever book. . . .
There is no disputing the ability with which the writer handles her
subject. I say <u>her</u> subject, because the minuteness of the touches, and
the odd, forcible style in which this book is written, point to it being
the work of a female hand. The book is an eminently readable one, and it
is never dull for a minute.”
</p><p>=Daily Telegraph.=—“It is a study of one of the worst passions which
can ruin a life-time and mar all human happiness—one of the worst, not
because it is necessarily the strongest, but because of its singular
effect in altering the complexion of things, transforming love into
suspicion, and filling its victim with a petulant and unreasonable
madness. All this Anthony Vert understands, and can describe with very
uncommon power. The soul of a jealous woman is analysed with artistic
completeness, and proved to be the petty, intolerant, half-insane thing
it really is. . . . The plot is well conceived, and well carried out.
Anthony Vert may be congratulated on having written a very clever
novel.”
</p><p>=The Monitor.=—“A wonderful piece of writing. The only modern parallel
we can find is supplied in Mr F. C. Philip’s ‘As in a Looking Glass.’”
</p><p>=World.=—“As the study of a jealous soul, ‘The Green Passion’ is a
success, and psychological students will be delighted with it. . . . The
tragedy which forms the <u>dénouement</u> to this story is of such a nature
as to preclude our doing more than remotely alluding to it, for he (or
is it she?) has portrayed an ‘exceedingly risky situation.’”
</p><p>=Whitehall Review.=—“In ‘The Green Passion’ the author traces with much
ability, and not a little analytical insight, the progress of jealousy
in the breast of a woman who is born with a very ‘intense,’ although not
a very deep, nature. . . . There is in Mr Vert’s work a certain tendency
towards realism which has its due effect in making his characters real.
They are no loosely-built fancies of the journalistic brain, but
portraits—almost snapshot portraits—of men and women of to-day.”
</p><p>_=Outrageous Fortune.=_ Being the Confessions of Evelyn Gray, Hospital
Nurse. A story founded on fact, proving that truth is stranger than
fiction. (In preparation.) Crown 8vo, cloth, 3s. 6d.
</p><p>_=The Dolomite Cavern.=_ An Exciting Tale of Adventure. By W. PATRICK
KELLY, Author of “Schoolboys Three,” etc. Crown 8vo, cloth, 3s. 6d.
</p><p>=Daily Telegraph.=—“Lovers of the sensational in fiction will find
abundance of congenial entertainment in Mr W. P. Kelly’s new story. In
the way of accessories to startling situations all is fish that comes to
this ingenious author’s net. The wonders of primitive nature, the
marvels of latter-day science, the extravagances of human passion—all
these he dexterously uses for the purpose of involving his hero in
perilous scrapes from which he no less dexterously extricates him by
expedients which, however far-fetched they may appear to the
unimaginative, are certainly not lacking in originality of device, or
cleverness of construction. . . . This is a specimen incident—those
which succeed it derive their special interest from the action of
Rontgen rays, subterranean torrents, and devastating inundations. The
book is very readable throughout, and ends happily. What more can the
average novel reader wish for in holiday time?”
</p><p>=Observer.=—“A story full of exciting adventure.”
</p><p>=Saturday Review.=—“The plot is ingenious, and the style pleasant.”
</p><p>=Literature.=—“‘The Dolomite Cavern’ has the great merit of being very
well written. The plot is sensational and improbable enough, but with
the aid of the author’s bright literary manner it carries us on
agreeably until the last chapter.”
</p><p>=Critic.=—“It is a sensational novel with a dash of pseudo-scientific
interest about it which is well calculated to attract the public. It is,
moreover, well written and vigorous.”
</p><p>=Manchester Guardian.=—“Mr Kelly’s fluent, rapid style makes his story
of mysteries readable and amusing. His Irish servant, one of the
principal characters, speaks a genuine Irish dialect—almost as rare in
fiction as the imitation is common.”
</p><p>=St James’s Budget.=—“Truly thrilling and dramatic, Mr Kelly’s book is
a cleverly written and absorbing romance. It concludes with a tremendous
scene, in which a life-and-death struggle with a madman in the midst of
a raging flood is the leading feature.”
</p><p>_=Madonna Mia=_, and other Stories. By =Clement Scott=,
Author of “Poppyland,” “The Wheel of Life,” “The Fate of Fenella,”
“Blossomland,” etc. Crown 8vo, cloth, 3s. 6d.
</p><p>=Punch.=—“‘Madonna Mia’ is genuinely interesting. All the stories are
good; you are ‘Scott free’ to pick ’em where you like.” (The Baron de B.
W.)
</p><p>=Weekly Sun.=—“Shows Mr Scott’s sturdy character painting and love of
picturesque adventure.”
</p><p>=Weekly Dispatch.=—“The book is characteristic of the work of its
author—bright, brilliant, informing, and entertaining, and without a
dull sentence in it.”
</p><p>=St James’s Gazette.=—“Full of grace and sentiment. The tales have each
their individuality and interest, and we can recommend the whole as
healthy refreshment for the idle or weary brain.”
</p><p>=Pelican.=—“Full of living, breathing, human interest. Few writers
possess the gift of bringing actual existence to their characters as
does Mr Scott, and in the pages of his newest book you shall find tears
and smiles, and all the emotions skilfully arranged and put in true
literary fashion.”
</p><p>=World.=—“Clement Scott is nothing if not sympathetic, and every one of
the ten stories is not only thoroughly readable, but is instinct with
sentiment; for Mr Scott still retains a wonderful enthusiasm, usually
the attribute of youth. ‘Drifting’ is a very fresh and convincing
narrative, founded, we understand, upon truth, and containing within a
small compass the materials for a very stirring drama. ‘A Cross of
Heather,’ too, is a charming romance, told with real pathos and
feeling.”
</p><p>_=The Shadow on The Manse.=_ A Tale of Religion and the Stage. By

L’EPINE, Author of “The Devil in a Domino.” Crown 8vo, art cloth, 3s.
6d.
</p><p>=Public Opinion.=—“A remarkable book. . . . We are plunged into a
delicious and tantalising romance; incident follows incident like a
panorama of exciting pictures. Fertility of imagination is everywhere
apparent, and the <u>dénouement</u> is artfully concealed till it bursts upon
the reader with a suddenness that fairly takes away his breath.”
</p><p>=Liverpool Mercury.=—“Lovers of the marvellous will enjoy it, for it is
cleverly and dramatically written.”
</p><p>=Dundee Advertiser.=—“Written with dramatic force and vigour.”
</p><p>=North British Advertiser.=—“This is a weird and strange story that
interests and fascinates the reader, with its occult fancies and
marvellous experiences. . . . It may be added, in conclusion, that it is
a book well worth reading, and will easily bear a second perusal.”
</p><p>=Liverpool Post.=—“A very skilfully constructed story, mysterious and
strange, with a natural explanation suggested of all the mystery which
does not spoil one’s enjoyment (here follows analysis of plot). This is
the bare outline of the story up to a certain point; it is impossible to
convey adequately an idea of the awe-inspiring characteristics of the
story. Readers can safely be recommended to turn to the book itself.”

    H. Smith &amp; Son as being “unfit to circulate in their libraries,”
    yet it has been praised by the press as being “a powerful sermon
    and a moral book.”_
</p><p>=Daily Telegraph.=—“A book by an anonymous author always arouses a
certain inquiry, and when the book is clever and original the interest
becomes keen, and conjecture is rife, endowing the most unlikely people
with authorship. . . . It is very brilliant, very forcible, very
sad. . . . It is perfect in its way, in style clear, sharp and forcible,
the dialogue epigrammatic and sparkling. . . . Enough has been said to
show that ‘The Hypocrite’ is a striking and powerful piece of work, and
that its author has established his claim to be considered a writer of
originality and brilliance.”
</p><p>=Daily Graphic.=—“A very moral book.”
</p><p>=Court Circular.=—“The work is decidedly clever, full of ready wit,
sparkling epigram, and cutting sarcasm.”
</p><p>=Echo.=—“The story is thoroughly interesting, the wit and epigram of
the writing are not to be denied, and altogether ‘The Hypocrite’ is so
brilliant that it can only be fittingly compared with ‘The Green
Carnation’ or ‘The Babe B.A.’”
</p><p>=Liverpool Courier.=—“A genuinely clever book. Furthermore, it is a
book with a wholesome moral vividly enforced.”
</p><p>=Lady.=—“Whoever the author may be, he has the right literary method,
his work is absolutely realistic, his style is fluent and distinctive,
and he has the rare faculty of gripping the reader’s attention at the
outset and retaining it to the very last. . . . ‘The Hypocrite’ is
something more than a remarkable novel—it is, in effect, a sermon,
conveying a definite message to those who have the wit to understand
it.”
</p><p>=Morning Post.=—“It is entitled to be regarded as one of the clever
books of the day. The writer shows artistic perception. He maintains
throughout an atmosphere perfectly in harmony with the idea that has
suggested his work.”

</p><p>=Bookman.=—“A highly emotional, cleverly written story.”
</p><p>=Lady.=—“A thrilling romance with a mediæval atmosphere, although the
scene is laid in the Cotswolds in the year of grace 1898. The story is
well constructed, and is a good example of the widely imaginative type
of fiction that is so eagerly devoured by young people nowadays.”
</p><p>=Lloyd’s.=—“The author has woven a clever story out of strange
materials. . . . The interest of the book only ceases when the end is
reached.”
</p><p>=Society.=—“Altogether a very intelligible and interesting story of
intrigue and love. The author has put some excellent work into the
book.”
</p><p>=Eastern Morning News.=—“Readers will be fascinated by the stirring
scenes, the swiftly moving panorama, the enacted tragedies, the wild,
passionate, lawless loves depicted in the most sensational manner in
this volume.”
</p><p>=Englishman= (Calcutta).—“It is a lurid tale of Spanish plotters. . . .
Around this central figure the author weaves an effective story with
more than considerable skill. He has achieved a brilliant success with
the character of Rufina; it is a masterpiece in its own way, and
invested with freshness, grace, and a magnetic personality.”
</p><p>_=Lord Jimmy.=_ A Story of Music-Hall Life. By GEORGE MARTYN. Crown 8vo,

</p><p>=Outlook.=—“The book is both humorous and dramatic.”
</p><p>=Pelican.=—“It is amusing and interesting—two very good qualities for
a novel to possess.”
</p><p>=Sheffield Telegraph.=—“The book is vivaciously written, several of the
characters being human enough to look like studies from life.”
</p><p>=Aberdeen Free Press.=—“The characters are skilfully depicted, and the
whole book is amusing and interesting.”
</p><p>=Glasgow Citizen.=—“‘Decidedly clever’ will be the verdict of the
reader on closing this book.”
</p><p>=Vanity Fair.=—“The author has a peculiar knowledge of the ‘Halls’ and
those who frequent them; and especially, as it seems to us, of those
Jewish persons who sometimes run them. And he has made good use of his
knowledge here. But there is more than this in the book; for ‘George
Martyn’ has considerable descriptive talent. His account, for instance,
of the fight between the hero and the butcher is quite good. The story
is straightforward, convincing, and full of human nature and promise.”
</p><p>_=The Lady of Criswold.=_ A Sensational Story. By LEONARD OUTRAM. Crown
8vo, cloth, 2s. 6d.
</p><p>=North British Advertiser.=—“A thrilling tale of love and madness.”
</p><p>=Whitehall Review.=—“No one can complain of lack of sensation, it is
full of startling episodes. The characters are drawn with a rapid and
vigorous touch. The interest is well maintained.”
</p><p>=Court Circular.=—“It reminds us forcibly of a story in real life that
engrossed public attention many years ago. Whether this was in the
author’s mind we cannot say, but the book is deeply interesting, the
characters well and strongly drawn, and we doubt not this tale will
fascinate many a reader.”
</p><p>=London Morning.=—“The story is cleverly constructed, is full of
incident with more than a dash of tragedy, and holds the attention of
the reader to the close. Dealing with modern life of the higher class,
Mr Outram’s story is consistent, and though it aims at romantic effect,
is not strained or overdrawn.”
</p><p>=Church Gazette.=—“We can heartily recommend ‘The Lady of Criswold.’
One likes to meet now and again a book which forsakes the eternal sex
question, or the hair-splitting discussion of ethical or psychological
problems, and treats us to simpler and more satisfying fare. . . . There
are several good hours’ reading in the book, and plenty of excitement of
the dramatic order. Another good point is that it is healthy in tone.”
</p><p>_=The Gates of Temptation.=_ A Natural Novel by Mrs ALBERT S. BRADSHAW,
Author of “False Gods,” “Wife or Slave,” etc. Crown 8vo, cloth, 2s. 6d.
</p><p>=Weekly Dispatch.=—“This is a story full of power and pathos, the
strong dramatic interest of which is sustained from the opening chapter
to the close.”
</p><p>=Midland Mail.=—“The characters are vividly drawn. There are many
pleasant and painful incidents in the book, which is interesting from
beginning to end.”
</p><p>=London Morning.=—“Mrs Albert Bradshaw has done such uniformly good
work that we have grown to expect much from her. Her latest book is one
which will enhance her reputation, and equally please new and old
readers of her novels. It is called ‘The Gates of Temptation,’ and
professes to be a natural novel. The story told is one of deep interest.
There is no veneer in its presentation, no artificiality about it.”
</p><p>=Aberdeen Free Press.=—“Mrs Bradshaw has written several good novels,
and the outstanding feature of all of them has been her skilful
development of plot, and her tasteful, pleasing style. In connection
with the present story we are able to amply reiterate those praises. The
plot again is well developed and logically carried out, while the
language used by the authoress is always happy and well chosen, and
never commonplace. . . . The story is a very powerful one indeed, and
may be highly commended as a piece of painstaking fiction of the very
highest kind.”

RAE-BROWN, Author of “Richard Barlow,” “Kissing Cup’s Race,” etc. Second
Impression. Crown 8vo, cloth, 2s. 6d.
</p><p>=Gentlewoman.=—“Fantastic and impossible, but at the same time
amusing. . . . The whole story is strongly dramatic.”
</p><p>=Saturday Review.=—“A grotesquely improbable story, but readers of
sporting novels will find much amusement in it.”
</p><p>=Scotsman.=—“The book is lightly and briskly written throughout. Its
pleasant cynicism is always entertaining.”
</p><p>=Star.=—“An ingeniously horrible story with a diabolically clever
plot.”
</p><p>=St James’s Budget.=—“A sporting romance which is indisputably cleverly
written. . . . The book is full of interesting items of sporting life
which are fascinating to lovers of the turf.”
</p><p>=Edinburgh Evening News.=—“It has certainly an audacious idea for its
central motive. . . . This bright idea is handled with no little skill,
and the interest is kept up breathlessly until the tragic end of the
experiment. The whole story has a racy flavour of the turf.”
</p><p>=Sporting life.=—“The character of the heartless roué, who tells his
story, is very well sustained, and the rich <u>parvenu</u>, Peter Drewitt,
the owner of the favourite that is very nearly nobbled by the
unscrupulous Beauclerc, is cleverly drawn. Altogether it is an exciting
and an uncommon tale, and is quite correct in all the sporting details.”
</p><p>_=Anna Marsden’s Experiment.=_ An interesting Novel. By ELLEN WILLIAMS.
Crown 8vo, art cloth, 2s. 6d.
</p><p>=Outlook.=—“A good story cleverly told and worked out.”
</p><p>=Echo.=—“A very natural and interesting tale is carefully set forth in
Ellen Williams’ clever little book.”
</p><p>=Western Morning News.=—“It is a smartly written and deeply interesting
story, well out of the beaten track of novelists.”
</p><p>=Literary World.=—“The story is well told. . . . Four racy chapters
take us thus far, and seven lively ones follow.”
</p><p>=Public Opinion.=—“From this point the interest in the story is such
that there is no putting the book down till the <u>dénouement</u> is reached.
The writing is smart, clever, and telling.”
</p><p>=Critic.=—“A powerful story, unconventional as regards both subject and
treatment. [Here the reviewer analyses the plot.] This situation is
handled with extraordinary delicacy and skill, and the book is an
admirable study of repressed emotions.”
</p><p>=Monitor.=—“Miss Williams has here seized on an original concept, and
given it fitting presentation. The ‘experiment’ is a novel one, and its
working out is a deft piece of writing. The psychology of the work is
faultless, and this study of a beautiful temperament, in a crude frame,
has with it the verity of deep observation and acute insight. . . . We
await with considerable confidence Miss Williams’ next venture.”
</p><p>=Sheffield Independent.=—“The writer has treated a delicate and unusual
situation with delicacy and originality. The heroine’s character is
drawn with firmness and clearness, and the whole story is vivid and
picturesque. . . . The history of the experiment is exceedingly well
told. Keen insight into character, and cleverness in its delineation, as
well as shrewd observation and intense sympathy, mark the writer’s work,
while the style is terse and clear, and the management of trying scenes
extremely good.”
</p><p>_=Darab’s Wine-Cup=_, and other Powerful and Vividly-Written Stories. By
BART KENNEDY, Author of “The Wandering Romanoff,” etc. New and cheaper
Edition. Crown 8vo, cloth, 2s. 6d.
</p><p>=Aberdeen Free Press.=—“Will be welcomed as something fresh in the
world of fiction.”
</p><p>=St James’s Budget.=—“A volume characteristic of the author’s splendid
powers.”
</p><p>=M. A. P.=—“Mr Kennedy writes powerfully, and can grip the reader’s
imagination, or whirl it off into the strangest domains of glamour and
romance at will. . . . There is a future for this clever young man from
Tipperary. He will do great things.”
</p><p>=Outlook.=—“Mr Bart Kennedy is a young writer of singular imaginative
gifts, and a style as individual as Mr Kipling’s.”
</p><p>=Weekly Dispatch.=—“The author has exceptional gifts, a strong and
powerful individuality, a facile pen, rich imagination, and constructive
ability of a high order. This volume ought to find a place on every
library shelf.”
</p><p>=Critic.=—“Of a highly imaginative order, and distinctly out of the
ordinary run. . . . The author has a remarkable talent for imaginative
and dramatic presentation. He sets before himself a higher standard of
achievement than most young writers of fiction.”
</p><p>=Cork Herald.=—“Gracefully written, easy and attractive in diction and
style, the stories are as choice a collection as we have happened on for
a long time. They are clever; they are varied; they are fascinating. We
admit them into the sacred circle of the most beautiful that have been
told by the most sympathetic and skilled writers. . . . Mr Kennedy has a
style, and that is rare enough nowadays—as refreshing as it is rare.”
</p><p>“_=Fame, the Fiddler.=_” A Story of Literary and Theatrical Life. By S.
J. ADAIR FITZ-GERALD. Crown 8vo, cloth, new and cheaper edition, 2s. 6d.
</p><p>=Graphic.=—“The volume will please and amuse numberless people.”
</p><p>=Pall Mall Gazette.=—“A pleasant, cheery story. Displays a rich vein of
robust imagination.”
</p><p>=Sun.=—“Interesting all through, and the inclination is towards
finishing it at one sitting.”
</p><p>=Scotsman.=—“An amusing and entertaining story of Bohemian life in
London.”
</p><p>=Standard.=—“There are many pleasant pages in ‘Fame, the Fiddler,’
which reminds us of ‘Trilby,’ with its pictures of Bohemian life, and
its happy-go-lucky group of good-hearted, generous scribblers, artists,
and playwrights. Some of the characters are so true to life that it is
impossible not to recognise them. Among the best incidents in the volume
must be mentioned the production of Pryor’s play, and the account of
poor Jimmy Lambert’s death, which is as moving an incident as we have
read for a long time. Altogether, ‘Fame, the Fiddler’ is a very human
book, and an amusing one as well.”
</p><p>=Catholic Times.=—“We read the volume through, and at the conclusion
marvelled at the wonderful knowledge of life the author displays. For
although the whole work is written in a light, humorous vein, underneath
this current of humour there is really an astonishing amount of wisdom,
and wisdom that is not displayed every day. . . . It is a vivid
description of times gay and melancholy, that occur in many lives. Mr
Fitz-Gerald has done his work well, so well that we loitered on many
pages, and closed the book finally with a feeling that it is a faithful
history of the journalist, the author, the theatrical individual, and
the man who ekes out a living by playing the <u>rôle</u> of all three.”

<p><strong>=CHEAPER FICTION=</strong>
</p><p>_=Pelican Tails.=_ A Collection of smart, up-to-date Tales of Modern
Life, written, edited and selected by FRANK M. BOYD (Editor of “The
Pelican.”) One of the most popular and entertaining volumes of short
stories that has ever been published. An ideal companion for a railway
journey or a spare hour or two. Crown 8vo, picture wrapper designed and
drawn by W. S. ROGERS, 1s. (In active preparation.)
</p><p>_=The Devil in a Domino.=_ A Psychological Mystery. By CHAS. L’EPINE,
Author of “The Lady of the Leopard,” “Miracle Plays,” etc. Cover
designed by C. H. BEAUVAIS. Long 12mo, cloth, 1s.
</p><p>=Truth.=—“The story is written with remarkable literary skill, and,
notwithstanding its gruesomeness, is undeniably fascinating.”
</p><p>=Sketch.=—“It is a well-written story. An admirable literary style,
natural and concise construction, succeed in compelling the reader’s
attention through every line. We hope to welcome the author again,
working on a larger scene.”
</p><p>=Star.=—“May be guaranteed to disturb your night’s rest. It is a
gruesome, ghastly, blood-curdling, hair-erecting, sleep-murdering piece
of work, with a thrill on every page. Read it.”
</p><p>=Sunday Chronicle.=—“A very clever study by ‘Charles L’Epine,’ who
should by his style be an accomplished author not unknown in other ranks
of literature. Beyond comparison it is the strongest shilling shocker we
have read for many a day. The author has succeeded in heaping horror
upon horror until one’s blood is curdled.”
</p><p>_=That Fascinating Widow=_, and other Frivolous and Fantastic Tales, for
River, Road and Rail. By =S. J. Adair Fitz-Gerald=. Long
12mo, cloth, 1s.
</p><p>=The Scotsman.=—“The widow is a charmingly wicked person. The stories
are well written, with a pleasant humour of a farcical sort; they are
never dull.”
</p><p>=Whitehall Review.=—“Written with all the dash and ease which Mr
Fitz-Gerald has accustomed us to in his journalistic work. There is a
breezy, invigorating style about this little book which will make it a
favourite on the bookstalls.”
</p><p>=Glasgow Herald.=—“Nonsense, genial harmless nonsense, to which the
most captious and morose of readers will find it difficult to refuse the
tribute of a broad smile, even if he can so far restrain himself as not
to burst out into genuine laughter.”
</p><p>=The Referee.=—“Another little humorous book is ‘That Fascinating
Widow,’ by Mr S. J. Adair Fitz-Gerald, who can be very funny when he
tries. The story which gives the title to the book would make a capital
farce. ‘The Blue-blooded Coster’ is an amusing piece of buffoonery.”
</p><p>=The Globe.=—“The author, Mr S. J. Adair Fitz-Gerald, has already shown
himself to be the possessor of a store of humour, on which he has again
drawn for the furnishing of the little volume he has just put together.
Among the tales included are several which might be suitable for reading
or recitation, and none which are dull. Mr Fitz-Gerald frankly addresses
to that portion of the public which desires nothing so much as to be
amused, and likes even its amusements in small doses. Such a public will
entertain itself very pleasantly with Mr Fitz-Gerald’s lively tales, and
will probably name as its favourites those titled ‘Pure Cussedness,’
‘Splidgings’ First Baby,’ and ‘The Blue-blooded Coster.’”
</p><p>_=Shadows.=_ A Series of Side Lights on Modern Society. By ERNEST
MARTIN. (Dedicated to Sir Henry Irving.) Crown 8vo, art cloth, gilt
tops, 2s.
</p><p>=Phoœnix.=—“‘Shadows’ is a very clever work.”
</p><p>=Western Mercury.=—“Clever sketches, intensely dramatic, original and
forceful, based on scenes from actual life, and narrated with much
skill.”
</p><p>=Weekly Times.=—“A series of pictures sketched with considerable power.
The last one, ‘Hell in Paradise,’ is terrible in the probable truth of
conception.”
</p><p>=Northern Figaro.=—“Mr Martin’s descriptive paragraphs are coached in
trenchant, convincing language, without a superfluous word sandwiched in
anywhere. . . . ‘Shadows’ may be read with much profit, and will give
more than a superficial insight into various phases of society life and
manners.”
</p><p>_=Death and the Woman.=_ A Powerful Tale. By ARNOLD GOLSWORTHY. Picture
cover drawn by =Sydney H. Syme=. Crown 8vo, 1s.
</p><p>=Scotsman.=—“A cleverly constructed story about a murder and a gang of
diamond robbers. . . . The tale never has to go far without a strong
situation. It is a capital book for a railway journey.”
</p><p>=Star.=—“A good shilling’s worth of highly coloured sensationalism.
Those readers who want a good melodramatic story smartly told, Mr
Golsworthy’s latest effort will suit down to the ground.”
</p><p>=Literary World.=—“We do not remember having read a book that possessed
the quality of <u>grip</u> in a greater degree than is the case with ‘Death
and the Woman.’ . . . Every page of every chapter develops the interest,
which culminates in one of the most sensational <u>dénouements</u> it has
been our lot to read. The flavour of actuality is not destroyed by any
incredible incident; it is the inevitable thing that always happens.
‘Death and the Woman’ will supply to the brim the need of those in
search of a holding drama of modern London life.”
</p><p>_=The Fellow-Passengers.=_ A Mystery and its Solution. A Detective
Story. By RIVINGTON PYKE, Author of “The Man who Disappeared.” Long
12mo, cloth, 1s.
</p><p>=Whitehall Review.=—“Those who love a mystery with plenty of ‘go,’ and
a story which is not devoid of a certain amount of realism, cannot do
better than pick up ‘Fellow-Passengers.’ The characters are real men and
women, and not the sentimental and artificial puppets to which we have
been so long accustomed by our sensationalists. The book is brightly
written, and of detective stories it is the best I have read lately.”
</p><p>=Weekly Dispatch.=—“If you want a diverting story of realism, bordering
upon actuality, you cannot do better than take up this bright,
vivacious, dramatic volume. It will interest you from first page to
last.”
</p><p>=Catholic Times.=—“This is a well-written story, with a good plot and
plenty of incident. From cover to cover there is not a dull page, and
the interest keeps up to the end.”
</p><p>=Glasgow News.=—“It is a thriller. . . . The sort of book one cannot
help finishing at a sitting, not merely because it is short, but because
it rivets. . . . The author uses his materials with great ingenuity, his
plot is cleverly devised, and he very effectively works up to a striking
<u>dénouement</u>.”

books.”
</p><p>=Spectator.=—“Well provided with fun and fancy.”
</p><p>=Morning Post.=—“Bright and thoroughly amusing. It will please all
children. The pictures are excellent.”
</p><p>=Echo.=—“Of the pile (of children’s books) before us, Mr Adair
Fitz-Gerald’s ‘Grand Panjandrum’ is the cleverest. Mr Fitz-Gerald needs
no introduction to the nursery of these days.”
</p><p>=Times.=—“Very fanciful.”
</p><p>=Church News.=—“This is one of the most delightful books of nonsense we
have read since we welcomed ‘The Wallypug of Why.’”
</p><p>=Scotsman.=—“Will make the eyes of readers open wide with wonder and
delight.”
</p><p>=Lloyd’s.=—“Will amuse all children lucky enough to get this neat and
pretty volume.”
</p><p>=Pall Mall Gazette.=—“A charming little book. Simply written, and
therefore to be comprehended of the youthful mind. It will be popular,
for the writer has a power of pleasing which is rare.”
</p><p>=Literary World.=—“A handsomely bound, mouth-watering, in every way
up-to-date volume, written especially for and on behalf of the toddler
or the newly breeched.”
</p><p>=People.=—“A delightful story for children, something in the style of
‘Alice in Wonderland,’ but also having some flavour of Kingsley’s ‘Water
Babies.’”
</p><p>=Sun.=—“Good fairy stories are a source of everlasting joy and delight.
Mr Adair Fitz-Gerald breaks fresh ground and writes pleasantly. . . .
The book has the added advantage of being charmingly illustrated in
colour by Gustave Darré.”
</p><p>=Nottingham Guardian.=—“It is a merry book, and should keep the nursery
in a good humour for hours. It is artistically got up, the illustrations
by Mr Gustave Darré being of a high order of merit.”
</p><p>=Manchester Courier.=—“It should prove a great favourite with young
people, being written by one who evidently takes the utmost interest in
them and their ways. The full-page illustrations are very pretty.”
</p><p>=Weekly Sun.=—“Mr Adair Fitz-Gerald is a well-known writer of fairy
stories and humorous books for the young. ‘The Grand Panjandrum’ is just
the sort of book to please youngsters of all ages, being full of
pleasant imaginings, and introducing its readers to a host of curious
people.”

</p><p>_=The Pottle Papers.=_ Written by TRISTRAM COUTTS, Author of “A Comedy
of Temptation.” Illustrated by =L. Raven Hill=. Fourth
Edition. Crown 8vo, cloth, 2s. 6d.
</p><p>=THE POTTLE PAPERS=, the fourth edition of which is just ready, is a
really funny book written by Saul Smiff, and illustrated by Mr L. Raven
Hill. “Anyone who wants a good laugh should get “The Pottle Papers,”
says the =Sheffield Daily Telegraph=. “They are very droll reading for
an idle afternoon, or picking up at any time when ‘down in the dumps.’
They are very brief and very bright, and it is impossible for anyone
with the slightest sense of humour to read the book without bursting
into ‘the loud guffaw’ which does not always ‘bespeak the empty mind.’”
The =Pall Mall Gazette= says it contains “Plenty of boisterous humour of
the Max Adeler kind . . . humour that is genuine and spontaneous. The
author, for all his antics, has a good deal more in him than the average
buffoon. There is, for example, a very clever and subtle strain of
feeling running through the comedy in ‘The Love that Burned’—a rather
striking bit of work. Mr Raven Hill’s illustrations are as amusing as
they always are.” The =St James’s Budget= accorded this book a very long
notice, and reproduced some of the pictures. The reviewer said: “Who
says the sense of humour is dead when we have ‘The Pottle Papers’? We
can put the book down with the feeling that we have spent a very
enjoyable hour and laughed immoderately. ‘The Pottle Papers’ will be in
everybody’s hands before long.” H.R.H. the Prince of Wales honoured the
author by accepting a copy of his book; and the =Court Circular=
remarked: “The Prince of Wales has accepted a copy of Saul Smiff’s
delightfully merry book, ‘The Pottle Papers.’ The Prince is sure to
enjoy Raven Hill’s clever sketches.” This funniest of funny books is
published at 2s. 6d., strongly bound in cloth.

Clement Scott. Crown 8vo, art cloth, gilt edges, 2s. Popular Edition,
sewed, picture cover, 1s.
</p><p>=DAN LENO, HYS BOOKE=, is, says the =Liverpool Review=, “the funniest
publication since ‘Three Men in a Boat.’ In this autobiographical
masterpiece the inimitable King of Comedians tells his life story in a
style that would make a shrimp laugh.” This enormously successful book
of genuine and spontaneous humour has been received with a complete
chorus of complimentary criticisms and pleasing “Press” praise and
approval. Here are a few reviewers’ remarks: “Bombshells of
fun.”—=Scotsman.= “One long laugh from start to finish.”—=Lloyd’s.=
“Full of exuberant and harmless fun.”—=Globe.= “A deliciously humorous
volume.”—=English Illustrated Magazine.= “The fun is fast and
furious.”—=Catholic Times.= “It is very funny.”—=St Paul’s.= These are
a few opinions taken at random from hundreds of notices. Says the =Daily
News= (Hull): “The funniest book we have read for some time. You must
perforce scream with huge delight at the dry sayings and writings of the
funny little man who has actually killed people with his patter and his
antics. Page after page of genuine fun is reeled off by the great little
man.”

                      A FEW OF MANY PRESS OPINIONS</pre>
<p>=Daily Telegraph.=—(Mr W. L. COURTNEY in “Books of the Day.”)—“He
writes fluently, and has genuine enthusiasm for his subject, and an
intimate acquaintance with his work. Moreover, his book has been
submitted to Mr Kipling, whose characteristic letter to the author is
set forth in the Preface. . . . Of Mr Kipling’s heroes Mr Monkshood has
a thorough understanding, and his remarks on them are worth quoting.”
(Here follows a long extract.)
</p><p>=Scotsman.=—“This well-informed volume . . . is plainly sincere. It is
thoroughly well studied, and takes pains to answer all the questions
that are usually put about Mr Kipling. The writer’s enthusiasm carries
both himself and his reader along in the most agreeable style. . . . One
way and another, his book is full of interest; those who wish to talk
about Mr Kipling will find it invaluable, while the thousands of his
admirers will read it through with delighted sympathy.”
</p><p>=Western Daily Press.=—“A very praiseworthy attempt, and by a writer
imbued with a fervent esteem for his subject. . . . This valuation of
the work of our most virile Empire author should hold the attention of
those who have well studied the subject and can appreciate accordingly.”
</p><p>=Sun.=—“The author has carefully compiled a lot of most interesting
matter, which he has edited with care and conscientiousness, and the
result is a volume which every lover of Kipling can read with pleasure.”
</p><p>=Spectator.=—“It is very readable. It tells us some things which we
might not otherwise have known, and puts together in a convenient form
many things which are of common knowledge.”
</p><p>=Outlook.=—“Something more than an attempt at appreciation. . . . Mr
Monkshood has written what all the young men at home and abroad who
treasure Mr Kipling’s writings think, but have not expressed. The volume
is a striking testimony to the hold which work that is clean and sane
and virile has upon the rising generation. And for this we cannot be
sufficiently thankful.”
</p><p>=Globe.=—“It has at the basis both knowledge and enthusiasm—knowledge
of the works estimated and enthusiasm for them. . . . This book may be
accepted as a generous exposition of Mr Kipling’s merits as a writer. We
can well believe that it will have many interested and approving
readers.”
</p><p>=Irish Times.=—“A well-thought-out and earnest appreciation of the
great writer and his works.”
</p><p>=Academy.=—“The book should give its subject pleasure, for Mr Monkshood
is very keen and cordial. His criticisms have some shrewdness too. Here
is a passage . . .” (Long quotation follows.)
</p><p>=Sunday Times.=—“Sure to attract much attention. In it we are given a
sketch of Mr Kipling’s career and the story of his various works, along
with some sane and balanced criticism. . . . The book is written
brightly, thoughtfully, and informingly.”
</p><p>=Bookseller.=—“It is acute in perception, and sympathetic to the verge
of worship, with just as much criticism as will allow that the hero has
his limitations. . . . Mr Monkshood’s well-informed and well-written
critique possesses undoubted ability and attraction.”
</p><p>=Yorkshire Herald.=—“This work, which is highly appreciative, will be
received with enthusiasm. . . . From this point the biography becomes
even more interesting. . . . The author deals at length with Kipling’s
works, and with sufficient forcefulness and originality to hold the
reader’s attention throughout. The biography has undoubted merit and
will be largely read.”
