The Bellman looked huffish, and wrinkled his brow.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If only you’d spoken before!<br/>
It’s excessively awkward to mention it now,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!

</p>
<p>
"We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you never were met with again&mdash;<br/>
But surely, my man, when the voyage began,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might have suggested it then?

</p>
<p>
"It’s excessively awkward to mention it now&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I think I’ve already remarked."<br/>
&nbsp;And the man they called "Hi!" replied, with a sigh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I informed you the day we embarked.

</p>
<p>
"You may charge me with murder&mdash;or want of sense&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(We are all of us weak at times):<br/>
But the slightest approach to a false pretence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was never among my crimes!

</p>
<p>
"I said it in Hebrew<br/>
&mdash;I said it in Dutch&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said it in German and Greek:<br/>
But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That English is what you speak!"

</p>
<p>
"‘Tis a pitiful tale," said the Bellman, whose face<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had grown longer at every word:<br/>
"But, now that you’ve stated the whole of your case,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More debate would be simply absurd.

</p>
<p>
"The rest of my speech" (he explained to his men)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shall hear when I’ve leisure to speak it.<br/>
But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Tis your glorious duty to seek it!

</p>
<p>
"To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pursue it with forks and hope;<br/>
To threaten its life with a railway-share;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To charm it with smiles and soap!

</p>
<p>
"For the Snark’s a peculiar creature, that won’t<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be caught in a commonplace way.<br/>
Do all that you know, and try all that you don’t:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a chance must be wasted to-day!

</p>
<p>
"For England expects<br/>
&mdash;I forbear to proceed:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:<br/>
And you’d best be unpacking the things that you need<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rig yourselves out for the fight."

</p>
<p>
Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And changed his loose silver for notes.<br/>
The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook the dust out of his coats.

</p>
<p>
The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each working the grindstone in turn:<br/>
But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No interest in the concern:

</p>
<p>
Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vainly proceeded to cite<br/>
A number of cases, in which making laces<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been proved an infringement of right.

</p>
<p>
The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A novel arrangement of bows:<br/>
While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was chalking the tip of his nose.

</p>
<p>
But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With yellow kid gloves and a ruff&mdash;<br/>
Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which the Bellman declared was all "stuff."

</p>
<p>
"Introduce me, now there’s a good fellow," he said,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we happen to meet it together!"<br/>
&nbsp;And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said "That must depend on the weather."

</p>
<p>
The Beaver went simply galumphing about,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At seeing the Butcher so shy:<br/>
And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made an effort to wink with one eye.

</p>
<p>
"Be a man!" said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Butcher beginning to sob.<br/>
"Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall need all our strength for the job!"<br/>
