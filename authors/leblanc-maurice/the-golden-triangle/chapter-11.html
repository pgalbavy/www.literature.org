<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Patrice at once made up his mind what to do. He lifted Coralie to her
bed and asked her not to move or call out. Then he made sure that Ya-Bon
was not seriously wounded. Lastly, he rang violently, sounding all the
bells that communicated with the posts which he had placed in different
parts of the house.
</p><p>The men came hurrying up.
</p><p>"You're a pack of nincompoops," he said. "Some one's been here. Little
Mother Coralie and Ya-Bon have had a narrow escape from being killed."
</p><p>They began to protest loudly.
</p><p>"Silence!" he commanded. "You deserve a good hiding, every one of you.
I'll forgive you on one condition, which is that, all this evening and
all to-night, you speak of Little Mother Coralie as though she were
dead."
</p><p>"But whom are we to speak to, sir?" one of them objected. "There's
nobody here."
</p><p>"Yes, there is, you silly fool, since Little Mother Coralie and Ya-Bon
have been attacked. Unless it was yourselves who did it! . . . It
wasn't? Very well then. . . . And let me have no more nonsense. It's not
a question of speaking to others, but of talking among yourselves . . .
and of thinking, even, without speaking. There are people listening to
you, spying on you, people who hear what you say and who guess what you
don't say. So, until to-morrow, Little Mother Coralie will not leave her
room. You shall keep watch over her by turns. Those who are not watching
will go to bed immediately after dinner. No moving about the house, do
you understand? Absolute silence and quiet."
</p><p>"And old Siméon, sir?"
</p><p>"Lock him up in his room. He's dangerous because he's mad. They may have
taken advantage of his madness to make him open the door to them. Lock
him up!"
</p><p>Patrice's plan was a simple one. As the enemy, believing Coralie to be
on the point of death, had revealed to her his intention, which was to
kill Patrice as well, it was necessary that he should think himself free
to act, with nobody to suspect his schemes or to be on his guard against
him. He would enter upon the struggle and would then be caught in a
trap.
</p><p>Pending this struggle, for which he longed with all his might, Patrice
saw to Ya-Bon's wound, which proved to be only slight, and questioned
him and Coralie. Their answers tallied at all points. Coralie, feeling a
little tired, was lying down reading. Ya-Bon remained in the passage,
outside the open door, squatting on the floor, Arab-fashion. Neither of
them heard anything suspicious. And suddenly Ya-Bon saw a shadow between
himself and the light in the passage. This light, which came from an
electric lamp, was put out at just about the same time as the light in
the bed-room. Ya-Bon, already half-erect, felt a violent blow in the
back of the neck and lost consciousness. Coralie tried to escape by the
door of her boudoir, was unable to open it, began to cry out and was at
once seized and thrown down. All this had happened within the space of a
few seconds.
</p><p>The only hint that Patrice succeeded in obtaining was that the man came
not from the staircase but from the servants' wing. This had a smaller
staircase of its own, communicating with the kitchen through a pantry by
which the tradesmen entered from the Rue Raynouard. The door leading to
the street was locked. But some one might easily possess a key.
</p><p>After dinner Patrice went in to see Coralie for a moment and then, at
nine o'clock, retired to his bedroom, which was situated a little lower
down, on the same side. It had been used, in Essarès Bey's lifetime, as
a smoking-room.
</p><p>As the attack from which he expected such good results was not likely to
take place before the middle of the night, Patrice sat down at a
roll-top desk standing against the wall and took out the diary in which
he had begun his detailed record of recent events. He wrote on for half
an hour or forty minutes and was about to close the book when he seemed
to hear a vague rustle, which he would certainly not have noticed if his
nerves had not been stretched to their utmost state of tension. And he
remembered the day when he and Coralie had once before been shot at.
This time, however, the window was not open nor even ajar.
</p><p>He therefore went on writing without turning his head or doing anything
to suggest that his attention had been aroused; and he set down, almost
unconsciously, the actual phases of his anxiety:
</p><pre>
      "He is here. He is watching me. I wonder what he means
      to do. I doubt if he will smash a pane of glass and
      fire a bullet at me. He has tried that method before
      and found it uncertain and a failure. No, his plan is
      thought out, I expect, in a different and more
      intelligent fashion. He is more likely to wait for me
      to go to bed, when he can watch me sleeping and effect
      his entrance by some means which I can't guess.
      "Meanwhile, it's extraordinarily exhilarating to know
      that his eyes are upon me. He hates me; and his hatred
      is coming nearer and nearer to mine, like one sword
      feeling its way towards another before clashing. He is
      watching me as a wild animal, lurking in the dark,
      watches its prey and selects the spot on which to
      fasten its fangs. But no, I am certain that it's he
      who is the prey, doomed beforehand to defeat and
      destruction. He is preparing his knife or his red-silk
      cord. And it's these two hands of mine that will
      finish the battle. They are strong and powerful and
      are already enjoying their victory. They will be
      victorious."</pre>
<p>Patrice shut down the desk, lit a cigarette and smoked it quietly, as
his habit was before going to bed. Then he undressed, folded his clothes
carefully over the back of a chair, wound up his watch, got into bed and
switched off the light.
</p><p>"At last," he said to himself, "I shall know the truth. I shall know who
this man is. Some friend of Essarès', continuing his work? But why this
hatred of Coralie? Is he in love with her, as he is trying to finish me
off too? I shall know . . . I shall soon know. . . ."
</p><p>An hour passed, however, and another hour, during which nothing happened
on the side of the window. A single creaking came from somewhere beside
the desk. But this no doubt was one of those sounds of creaking
furniture which we often hear in the silence of the night.
</p><p>Patrice began to lose the buoyant hope that had sustained him so far. He
perceived that his elaborate sham regarding Coralie's death was a poor
thing after all and that a man of his enemy's stamp might well refuse to
be taken in by it. Feeling rather put out, he was on the point of going
to sleep, when he heard the same creaking sound at the same spot.
</p><p>The need to do something made him jump out of bed. He turned on the
light. Everything seemed to be as he had left it. There was no trace of
a strange presence.
</p><p>"Well," said Patrice, "one thing's certain: I'm no good. The enemy must
have smelt a rat and guessed the trap I laid for him. Let's go to sleep.
There will be nothing happening to-night."
</p><p>There was in fact no alarm.
</p><p>Next morning, on examining the window, he observed that a stone ledge
ran above the ground-floor all along the garden front of the house, wide
enough for a man to walk upon by holding on to the balconies and
rain-pipes. He inspected all the rooms to which the ledge gave access.
None of them was old Siméon's room.
</p><p>"He hasn't stirred out, I suppose?" he asked the two soldiers posted on
guard.
</p><p>"Don't think so, sir. In any case, we haven't unlocked the door."
</p><p>Patrice went in and, paying no attention to the old fellow, who was
still sucking at his cold pipe, he searched the room, having it at the
back of his mind that the enemy might take refuge there. He found
nobody. But what he did discover, in a press in the wall, was a number
of things which he had not seen on the occasion of his investigations in
M. Masseron's company. These consisted of a rope-ladder, a coil of lead
pipes, apparently gas-pipes, and a small soldering-lamp.
</p><p>"This all seems devilish odd," he said to himself. "How did the things
get in here? Did Siméon collect them without any definite object,
mechanically? Or am I to assume that Siméon is merely an instrument of
the enemy's? He used to know the enemy before he lost his reason; and he
may be under his influence at present."
</p><p>Siméon was sitting at the window, with his back to the room. Patrice
went up to him and gave a start. In his hands the old man held a
funeral-wreath made of black and white beads. It bore a date, "14 April,
1915," and made the twentieth, the one which Siméon was preparing to lay
on the grave of his dead friends.
</p><p>"He will lay it there," said Patrice, aloud. "His instinct as an
avenging friend, which has guided his steps through life, continues in
spite of his insanity. He will lay it on the grave. That's so, Siméon,
isn't it: you will take it there to-morrow? For to-morrow is the
fourteenth of April, the sacred anniversary. . . ."
</p><p>He leant over the incomprehensible being who held the key to all the
plots and counterplots, to all the treachery and benevolence that
constituted the inextricable drama. Siméon thought that Patrice wanted
to take the wreath from him and pressed it to his chest with a startled
gesture.
</p><p>"Don't be afraid," said Patrice. "You can keep it. To-morrow, Siméon,
to-morrow, Coralie and I will be faithful to the appointment which you
gave us. And to-morrow perhaps the memory of the horrible past will
unseal your brain."
</p><p>The day seemed long to Patrice, who was eager for something that would
provide a glimmer in the surrounding darkness. And now this glimmer
seemed about to be kindled by the arrival of this twentieth anniversary
of the fourteenth of April.
</p><p>At a late hour in the afternoon M. Masseron called at the Rue Raynouard.
</p><p>"Look what I've just received," he said to Patrice. "It's rather
curious: an anonymous letter in a disguised hand. Listen:
</p><pre>
      "'<u>Sir</u>, be warned. They're going away. Take care.
      To-morrow evening the 1800 bags will be on their way
      out of the country.
      A FRIEND OF FRANCE.'"</pre>
<p>"And to-morrow is the fourteenth of April," said Patrice, at once
connecting the two trains of thought in his mind.
</p><p>"Yes. What makes you say that?"
</p><p>"Nothing. . . . Something that just occurred to me. . . ."
</p><p>He was nearly telling M. Masseron all the facts associated with the
fourteenth of April and all those concerning the strange personality of
old Siméon. If he did not speak, it was for obscure reasons, perhaps
because he wished to work out this part of the case alone, perhaps also
because of a sort of shyness which prevented him from admitting M.
Masseron into all the secrets of the past. He said nothing about it,
therefore, and asked:
</p><p>"What do you think of the letter?"
</p><p>"Upon my word, I don't know what to think. It may be a warning with
something to back it, or it may be a trick to make us adopt one course
of conduct rather than another. I'll talk about it to Bournef."
</p><p>"Nothing fresh on his side?"
</p><p>"No; and I don't expect anything in particular. The alibi which he has
submitted is genuine. His friends and he are so many supers. Their parts
are played."
</p><p>The coincidence of dates was all that stuck in Patrice's mind. The two
roads which M. Masseron and he were following suddenly met on this day
so long since marked out by fate. The past and the present were about to
unite. The catastrophe was at hand. The fourteenth of April was the day
on which the gold was to disappear for good and also the day on which an
unknown voice had summoned Patrice and Coralie to the same tryst which
his father and her mother had kept twenty years ago.
</p><p>And the next day was the fourteenth of April.
</p><hr/>
<p>At nine o'clock in the morning Patrice asked after old Siméon.
</p><p>"Gone out, sir. You had countermanded your orders."
</p><p>Patrice entered the room and looked for the wreath. It was not there.
Moreover, the three things in the cupboard, the rope-ladder, the coil of
lead and the glazier's lamp, were not there either.
</p><p>"Did Siméon take anything with him?"
</p><p>"Yes, sir, a wreath."
</p><p>"Nothing else?"
</p><p>"No, sir."
</p><p>The window was open. Patrice came to the conclusion that the things had
gone by this way, thus confirming his theory that the old fellow was an
unconscious confederate.
</p><p>Shortly before ten o'clock Coralie joined him in the garden. Patrice had
told her the latest events. She looked pale and anxious.
</p><p>They went round the lawns and, without being seen, reached the clumps of
dwarf shrubs which hid the door on the lane. Patrice opened the door. As
he started to open the other his hand hesitated. He felt sorry that he
had not told M. Masseron and that he and Coralie were performing by
themselves a pilgrimage which certain signs warned him to be dangerous.
He shook off the obsession, however. He had two revolvers with him. What
had he to fear?
</p><p>"You're coming in, aren't you, Coralie?"
</p><p>"Yes," she said.
</p><p>"I somehow thought you seemed undecided, anxious . . ."
</p><p>"It's quite true," said Coralie. "I feel a sort of hollowness."
</p><p>"Why? Are you afraid?"
</p><p>"No. Or rather yes. I'm not afraid for to-day, but in some way for the
past. I think of my poor mother, who went through this door, as I am
doing, one April morning. She was perfectly happy, she was going to
meet her love. . . . And then I feel as if I wanted to hold her back and
cry, 'Don't go on. . . . Death is lying in wait for you. . . . Don't go
on. . . .' And it's I who hear those words of terror, they ring in my
ears; it's I who hear them and I dare not go on. I'm afraid."
</p><p>"Let's go back, Coralie."
</p><p>She only took his arm:
</p><p>"No," she said, in a firm voice. "We'll walk on. I want to pray. It will
do me good."
</p><p>Boldly she stepped along the little slanting path which her mother had
followed and climbed the slope amid the tangled weeds and the straggling
branches. They passed the lodge on their left and reached the leafy
cloisters where each had a parent lying buried. And at once, at the
first glance, they saw that the twentieth wreath was there.
</p><p>"Siméon has come," said Patrice. "An all-powerful instinct obliged him
to come. He must be somewhere near."
</p><p>While Coralie knelt down beside the tombstone, he hunted around the
cloisters and went as far as the middle of the garden. There was nothing
left but to go to the lodge, and this was evidently a dread act which
they put off performing, if not from fear, at least from the reverent
awe which checks a man on entering a place of death and crime.
</p><p>It was Coralie once again who gave the signal for action:
</p><p>"Come," she said.
</p><p>Patrice did not know how they would make their way into the lodge, for
all its doors and windows had appeared to them to be shut. But, as they
approached, they saw that the back-door opening on the yard was wide
open, and they at once thought that Siméon was waiting for them inside.
</p><p>It was exactly ten o'clock when they crossed the threshold of the lodge.
A little hall led to a kitchen on one side and a bedroom on the other.
The principal room must be that opposite. The door stood ajar.
</p><p>"That's where it must have happened . . . long ago," said Coralie, in a
frightened whisper.
</p><p>"Yes," said Patrice, "we shall find Siméon there. But, if your courage
fails you, Coralie, we had better give it up."
</p><p>An unquestioning force of will supported her. Nothing now would have
induced her to stop. She walked on.
</p><p>Though large, the room gave an impression of coziness, owing to the way
in which it was furnished. The sofas, armchairs, carpet and hangings all
tended to add to its comfort; and its appearance might well have
remained unchanged since the tragic death of the two who used to occupy
it. This appearance was rather that of a studio, because of a skylight
which filled the middle of the high ceiling, where the belvedere was.
The light came from here. There were two other windows, but these were
hidden by curtains.
</p><p>"Siméon is not here," said Patrice.
</p><p>Coralie did not reply. She was examining the things around her with an
emotion which was reflected in every feature. There were books, all of
them going back to the last century. Some of them were signed "Coralie"
in pencil on their blue or yellow wrappers. There were pieces of
unfinished needlework, an embroidery-frame, a piece of tapestry with a
needle hanging to it by a thread of wool. And there were also books
signed "Patrice" and a box of cigars and a blotting-pad and an inkstand
and penholders. And there were two small framed photographs, those of
two children, Patrice and Coralie. And thus the life of long ago went
on, not only the life of two lovers who loved each other with a violent
and fleeting passion, but of two beings who dwell together in the calm
assurance of a long existence spent in common.
</p><p>"Oh, my darling, darling mother!" Coralie whispered.
</p><p>Her emotion increased with each new memory. She leant trembling on
Patrice's shoulder.
</p><p>"Let's go," he said.
</p><p>"Yes, dear, yes, we had better. We will come back again. . . . We will
come back to them. . . . We will revive the life of love that was cut
short by their death. Let us go for to-day; I have no strength left."
</p><p>But they had taken only a few steps when they stopped dismayed.
</p><p>The door was closed.
</p><p>Their eyes met, filled with uneasiness.
</p><p>"We didn't close it, did we?" he asked.
</p><p>"No," she said, "we didn't close it."
</p><p>He went to open it and perceived that it had neither handle nor lock.
</p><p>It was a single door, of massive wood that looked hard and substantial.
It might well have been made of one piece, taken from the very heart of
an oak. There was no paint or varnish on it. Here and there were
scratches, as if some one had been rapping at it with a tool. And then
. . . and then, on the right, were these few words in pencil:
</p><pre>
     <u>Patrice and Coralie, 14 April, 1895</u>
              <u>God will avenge us</u></pre>
<p>Below this was a cross and, below the cross, another date, but in a
different and more recent handwriting:
</p><p>     <u>14 April, 1915</u>
</p><p>"This is terrible, this is terrible," said Patrice. "To-day's date! Who
can have written that? It has only just been written. Oh, it's terrible!
. . . Come, come, after all, we can't . . ."
</p><p>He rushed to one of the windows, tore back the curtain that veiled it
and pulled upon the casement. A cry escaped him. The window was walled
up, walled up with building-stones that filled the space between the
glass and the shutters.
</p><p>He ran to the other window and found the same obstacle.
</p><p>There were two doors, leading probably to the bedroom on the right and
to a room next to the kitchen on the left. He opened them quickly. Both
doors were walled up.
</p><p>He ran in every direction, during the first moment of terror, and then
hurled himself against the first of the three doors and tried to break
it down. It did not move. It might have been an immovable block.
</p><p>Then, once again, they looked at each other with eyes of fear; and the
same terrible thought came over them both. The thing that had happened
before was being repeated! The tragedy was being played a second time.
After the mother and the father, it was the turn of the daughter and the
son. Like the lovers of yesteryear, those of to-day were prisoners. The
enemy held them in his powerful grip; and they would doubtless soon know
how their parents had died by seeing how they themselves would die.
