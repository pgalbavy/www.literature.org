I now mean to be serious;&mdash;it is time,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since laughter now-a-days is deem'd too serious.<br/>
A jest at Vice by Virtue 's call'd a crime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And critically held as deleterious:<br/>
Besides, the sad 's a source of the sublime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although when long a little apt to weary us;<br/>
And therefore shall my lay soar high and solemn,<br/>
As an old temple dwindled to a column.

</p>
<p>
The Lady Adeline Amundeville<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;('Tis an old Norman name, and to be found<br/>
In pedigrees, by those who wander still<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the last fields of that Gothic ground)<br/>
Was high-born, wealthy by her father's will,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And beauteous, even where beauties most abound,<br/>
In Britain&mdash;which of course true patriots find<br/>
The goodliest soil of body and of mind.

</p>
<p>
I 'll not gainsay them; it is not my cue;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I 'll leave them to their taste, no doubt the best:<br/>
An eye 's an eye, and whether black or blue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is no great matter, so 't is in request,<br/>
'T is nonsense to dispute about a hue&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The kindest may be taken as a test.<br/>
The fair sex should be always fair; and no man,<br/>
Till thirty, should perceive there 's a plain woman.

</p>
<p>
And after that serene and somewhat dull<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Epoch, that awkward corner turn'd for days<br/>
More quiet, when our moon 's no more at full,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We may presume to criticise or praise;<br/>
Because indifference begins to lull<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our passions, and we walk in wisdom's ways;<br/>
Also because the figure and the face<br/>
Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.

</p>
<p>
I know that some would fain postpone this era,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reluctant as all placemen to resign<br/>
Their post; but theirs is merely a chimera,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For they have pass'd life's equinoctial line:<br/>
But then they have their claret and Madeira<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To irrigate the dryness of decline;<br/>
And county meetings, and the parliament,<br/>
And debt, and what not, for their solace sent.

</p>
<p>
And is there not religion, and reform,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace, war, the taxes, and what 's call'd the 'Nation'?<br/>
The struggle to be pilots in a storm?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The landed and the monied speculation?<br/>
The joys of mutual hate to keep them warm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of love, that mere hallucination?<br/>
Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure;<br/>
Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.

</p>
<p>
Rough Johnson, the great moralist, profess'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Right honestly, 'he liked an honest hater!'-<br/>
The only truth that yet has been confest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within these latest thousand years or later.<br/>
Perhaps the fine old fellow spoke in jest:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I am but a mere spectator,<br/>
And gaze where'er the palace or the hovel is,<br/>
Much in the mode of Goethe's Mephistopheles;

</p>
<p>
But neither love nor hate in much excess;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though 't was not once so. If I sneer sometimes,<br/>
It is because I cannot well do less,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now and then it also suits my rhymes.<br/>
I should be very willing to redress<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Men's wrongs, and rather check than punish crimes,<br/>
Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale<br/>
Of Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.

</p>
<p>
Of all tales 't is the saddest&mdash;and more sad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it makes us smile: his hero 's right,<br/>
And still pursues the right;&mdash;to curb the bad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His only object, and 'gainst odds to fight<br/>
His guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But his adventures form a sorry sight;<br/>
A sorrier still is the great moral taught<br/>
By that real epic unto all who have thought.

</p>
<p>
Redressing injury, revenging wrong,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To aid the damsel and destroy the caitiff;<br/>
Opposing singly the united strong,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From foreign yoke to free the helpless native:&mdash;<br/>
Alas! must noblest views, like an old song,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be for mere fancy's sport a theme creative,<br/>
A jest, a riddle, Fame through thin and thick sought!<br/>
And Socrates himself but Wisdom's Quixote?

</p>
<p>
Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A single laugh demolish'd the right arm<br/>
Of his own country;&mdash;seldom since that day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,<br/>
The world gave ground before her bright array;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore have his volumes done such harm,<br/>
That all their glory, as a composition,<br/>
Was dearly purchased by his land's perdition.

</p>
<p>
I 'm 'at my old lunes'&mdash;digression, and forget<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lady Adeline Amundeville;<br/>
The fair most fatal Juan ever met,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she was not evil nor meant ill;<br/>
But Destiny and Passion spread the net<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Fate is a good excuse for our own will),<br/>
And caught them;&mdash;what do they not catch, methinks?<br/>
But I 'm not OEdipus, and life 's a Sphinx.

</p>
<p>
I tell the tale as it is told, nor dare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To venture a solution: 'Davus sum!'<br/>
And now I will proceed upon the pair.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Adeline, amidst the gay world's hum,<br/>
Was the Queen-Bee, the glass of all that 's fair;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose charms made all men speak, and women dumb.<br/>
The last 's a miracle, and such was reckon'd,<br/>
And since that time there has not been a second.

</p>
<p>
Chaste was she, to detraction's desperation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wedded unto one she had loved well&mdash;<br/>
A man known in the councils of the nation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool, and quite English, imperturbable,<br/>
Though apt to act with fire upon occasion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Proud of himself and her: the world could tell<br/>
Nought against either, and both seem'd secure&mdash;<br/>
She in her virtue, he in his hauteur.

</p>
<p>
It chanced some diplomatical relations,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising out of business, often brought<br/>
Himself and Juan in their mutual stations<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into close contact. Though reserved, nor caught<br/>
By specious seeming, Juan's youth, and patience,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,<br/>
And form'd a basis of esteem, which ends<br/>
In making men what courtesy calls friends.

</p>
<p>
And thus Lord Henry, who was cautious as<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve and pride could make him, and full slow<br/>
In judging men&mdash;when once his judgment was<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,<br/>
Had all the pertinacity pride has,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which knows no ebb to its imperious flow,<br/>
And loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,<br/>
Because its own good pleasure hath decided.

</p>
<p>
His friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though oft well founded, which confirm'd but more<br/>
His prepossessions, like the laws of Persians<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Medes, would ne'er revoke what went before.<br/>
His feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of common likings, which make some deplore<br/>
What they should laugh at&mdash;the mere ague still<br/>
Of men's regard, the fever or the chill.

</p>
<p>
''T is not in mortals to command success:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But do you more, Sempronius&mdash;don't deserve it,'<br/>
And take my word, you won't have any less.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be wary, watch the time, and always serve it;<br/>
Give gently way, when there 's too great a press;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it,<br/>
For, like a racer, or a boxer training,<br/>
'T will make, if proved, vast efforts without paining.

</p>
<p>
Lord Henry also liked to be superior,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As most men do, the little or the great;<br/>
The very lowest find out an inferior,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least they think so, to exert their state<br/>
Upon: for there are very few things wearier<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than solitary Pride's oppressive weight,<br/>
Which mortals generously would divide,<br/>
By bidding others carry while they ride.

</p>
<p>
In birth, in rank, in fortune likewise equal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er Juan he could no distinction claim;<br/>
In years he had the advantage of time's sequel;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as he thought, in country much the same&mdash;<br/>
Because bold Britons have a tongue and free quill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At which all modern nations vainly aim;<br/>
And the Lord Henry was a great debater,<br/>
So that few members kept the house up later.

</p>
<p>
These were advantages: and then he thought&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was his foible, but by no means sinister&mdash;<br/>
That few or none more than himself had caught<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Court mysteries, having been himself a minister:<br/>
He liked to teach that which he had been taught,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;<br/>
And reconciled all qualities which grace man,<br/>
Always a patriot, and sometimes a placeman.

</p>
<p>
He liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost honour'd him for his docility;<br/>
Because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or contradicted but with proud humility.<br/>
He knew the world, and would not see depravity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In faults which sometimes show the soil's fertility,<br/>
If that the weeds o'erlive not the first crop&mdash;<br/>
For then they are very difficult to stop.

</p>
<p>
And then he talk'd with him about Madrid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantinople, and such distant places;<br/>
Where people always did as they were bid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or did what they should not with foreign graces.<br/>
Of coursers also spake they: Henry rid<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, like most Englishmen, and loved the races;<br/>
And Juan, like a true-born Andalusian,<br/>
Could back a horse, as despots ride a Russian.

</p>
<p>
And thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And diplomatic dinners, or at other&mdash;<br/>
For Juan stood well both with Ins and Outs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As in freemasonry a higher brother.<br/>
Upon his talent Henry had no doubts;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His manner show'd him sprung from a high mother;<br/>
And all men like to show their hospitality<br/>
To him whose breeding matches with his quality.

</p>
<p>
At Blank-Blank Square;&mdash;for we will break no squares<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By naming streets: since men are so censorious,<br/>
And apt to sow an author's wheat with tares,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaping allusions private and inglorious,<br/>
Where none were dreamt of, unto love's affairs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which were, or are, or are to be notorious,<br/>
That therefore do I previously declare,<br/>
Lord Henry's mansion was in Blank-Blank Square.

</p>
<p>
Also there bin another pious reason<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For making squares and streets anonymous;<br/>
Which is, that there is scarce a single season<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which doth not shake some very splendid house<br/>
With some slight heart-quake of domestic treason&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A topic scandal doth delight to rouse:<br/>
Such I might stumble over unawares,<br/>
Unless I knew the very chastest squares.

</p>
<p>
'T is true, I might have chosen Piccadilly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A place where peccadillos are unknown;<br/>
But I have motives, whether wise or silly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For letting that pure sanctuary alone.<br/>
Therefore I name not square, street, place, until I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Find one where nothing naughty can be shown,<br/>
A vestal shrine of innocence of heart:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such arebut I have lost the London Chart.<br/>
At Henry's mansion then, in Blank-Blank Square,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Juan a recherche, welcome guest,<br/>
As many other noble scions were;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And some who had but talent for their crest;<br/>
Or wealth, which is a passport every where;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or even mere fashion, which indeed 's the best<br/>
Recommendation; and to be well drest<br/>
Will very often supersede the rest.

</p>
<p>
And since 'there 's safety in a multitude<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of counsellors,' as Solomon has said,<br/>
Or some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed we see the daily proof display'd<br/>
In senates, at the bar, in wordy feud,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where'er collective wisdom can parade,<br/>
Which is the only cause that we can guess<br/>
Of Britain's present wealth and happiness;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
But as 'there 's safety' grafted in the number<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Of counsellors' for men, thus for the sex<br/>
A large acquaintance lets not Virtue slumber;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or should it shake, the choice will more perplex&mdash;<br/>
Variety itself will more encumber.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Midst many rocks we guard more against wrecks;<br/>
And thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's<br/>
Self-love, there 's safety in a crowd of coxcombs.

</p>
<p>
But Adeline had not the least occasion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a shield, which leaves but little merit<br/>
To virtue proper, or good education.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,<br/>
Which judged mankind at their due estimation;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for coquetry, she disdain'd to wear it:<br/>
Secure of admiration, its impression<br/>
Was faint, as of an every-day possession.

</p>
<p>
To all she was polite without parade;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To some she show'd attention of that kind<br/>
Which flatters, but is flattery convey'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a sort as cannot leave behind<br/>
A trace unworthy either wife or maid;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,<br/>
To those who were, or pass'd for meritorious,<br/>
Just to console sad glory for being glorious;

</p>
<p>
Which is in all respects, save now and then,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A dull and desolate appendage. Gaze<br/>
Upon the shades of those distinguish'd men<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,<br/>
The praise of persecution; gaze again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the most favour'd; and amidst the blaze<br/>
Of sunset halos o'er the laurel-brow'd,<br/>
What can ye recognise?&mdash;a gilded cloud.

</p>
<p>
There also was of course in Adeline<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That calm patrician polish in the address,<br/>
Which ne'er can pass the equinoctial line<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of any thing which nature would express;<br/>
Just as a mandarin finds nothing fine,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least his manner suffers not to guess<br/>
That any thing he views can greatly please.<br/>
Perhaps we have borrow'd this from the Chinese&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Perhaps from Horace: his 'Nil admirari'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was what he call'd the 'Art of Happiness;'<br/>
An art on which the artists greatly vary,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And have not yet attain'd to much success.<br/>
However, 't is expedient to be wary:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indifference certes don't produce distress;<br/>
And rash enthusiasm in good society<br/>
Were nothing but a moral inebriety.

</p>
<p>
But Adeline was not indifferent: for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Now for a common-place!) beneath the snow,<br/>
As a volcano holds the lava more<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within&mdash;et caetera. Shall I go on?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;No!<br/>
I hate to hunt down a tired metaphor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So let the often-used volcano go.<br/>
Poor thing! How frequently, by me and others,<br/>
It hath been stirr'd up till its smoke quite smothers!

</p>
<p>
I 'll have another figure in a trice:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What say you to a bottle of champagne?<br/>
Frozen into a very vinous ice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain,<br/>
Yet in the very centre, past all price,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About a liquid glassful will remain;<br/>
And this is stronger than the strongest grape<br/>
Could e'er express in its expanded shape:

</p>
<p>
'T is the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre<br/>
A hidden nectar under a cold presence.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And such are many&mdash;though I only meant her<br/>
From whom I now deduce these moral lessons,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On which the Muse has always sought to enter.<br/>
And your cold people are beyond all price,<br/>
When once you have broken their confounded ice.

</p>
<p>
But after all they are a North-West Passage<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the glowing India of the soul;<br/>
And as the good ships sent upon that message<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have not exactly ascertain'd the Pole<br/>
(Though Parry's efforts look a lucky presage),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus gentlemen may run upon a shoal;<br/>
For if the Pole 's not open, but all frost<br/>
(A chance still), 't is a voyage or vessel lost.

</p>
<p>
And young beginners may as well commence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With quiet cruising o'er the ocean woman;<br/>
While those who are not beginners should have sense<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough to make for port, ere time shall summon<br/>
With his grey signal-flag; and the past tense,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreary 'Fuimus' of all things human,<br/>
Must be declined, while life's thin thread 's spun out<br/>
Between the gaping heir and gnawing gout.

</p>
<p>
But heaven must be diverted; its diversion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is sometimes truculent&mdash;but never mind:<br/>
The world upon the whole is worth the assertion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(If but for comfort) that all things are kind:<br/>
And that same devilish doctrine of the Persian,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the two principles, but leaves behind<br/>
As many doubts as any other doctrine<br/>
Has ever puzzled Faith withal, or yoked her in.

</p>
<p>
The English winter&mdash;ending in July,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To recommence in August&mdash;now was done.<br/>
'T is the postilion's paradise: wheels fly;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On roads, east, south, north, west, there is a run.<br/>
But for post-horses who finds sympathy?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Man's pity 's for himself, or for his son,<br/>
Always premising that said son at college<br/>
Has not contracted much more debt than knowledge.

</p>
<p>
The London winter 's ended in July&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes a little later. I don't err<br/>
In this: whatever other blunders lie<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my shoulders, here I must aver<br/>
My Muse a glass of weatherology;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For parliament is our barometer:<br/>
Let radicals its other acts attack,<br/>
Its sessions form our only almanack.

</p>
<p>
When its quicksilver 's down at zero,&mdash;lo<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach, chariot, luggage, baggage, equipage!<br/>
Wheels whirl from Carlton palace to Soho,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And happiest they who horses can engage;<br/>
The turnpikes glow with dust; and Rotten Row<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleeps from the chivalry of this bright age;<br/>
And tradesmen, with long bills and longer faces,<br/>
Sigh&mdash;as the postboys fasten on the traces.

</p>
<p>
They and their bills, 'Arcadians both,' are left<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Greek kalends of another session.<br/>
Alas! to them of ready cash bereft,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What hope remains? Of hope the full possession,<br/>
Or generous draft, conceded as a gift,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At a long date&mdash;till they can get a fresh one&mdash;<br/>
Hawk'd about at a discount, small or large;<br/>
Also the solace of an overcharge.

</p>
<p>
But these are trifles. Downward flies my lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodding beside my lady in his carriage.<br/>
Away! away! 'Fresh horses!' are the word,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And changed as quickly as hearts after marriage;<br/>
The obsequious landlord hath the change restored;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The postboys have no reason to disparage<br/>
Their fee; but ere the water'd wheels may hiss hence,<br/>
The ostler pleads too for a reminiscence.

</p>
<p>
'T is granted; and the valet mounts the dickey&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That gentleman of lords and gentlemen;<br/>
Also my lady's gentlewoman, tricky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trick'd out, but modest more than poet's pen<br/>
Can paint,&mdash;'Cosi viaggino i Ricchi!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Excuse a foreign slipslop now and then,<br/>
If but to show I 've travell'd; and what 's travel,<br/>
Unless it teaches one to quote and cavil?)

</p>
<p>
The London winter and the country summer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were well nigh over. 'T is perhaps a pity,<br/>
When nature wears the gown that doth become her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To lose those best months in a sweaty city,<br/>
And wait until the nightingale grows dumber,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening debates not very wise or witty,<br/>
Ere patriots their true country can remember;&mdash;<br/>
But there 's no shooting (save grouse) till September.

</p>
<p>
I 've done with my tirade. The world was gone;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The twice two thousand, for whom earth was made,<br/>
Were vanish'd to be what they call alone&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, with thirty servants for parade,<br/>
As many guests, or more; before whom groan<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As many covers, duly, daily, laid.<br/>
Let none accuse Old England's hospitality&mdash;<br/>
Its quantity is but condensed to quality.

</p>
<p>
Lord Henry and the Lady Adeline<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Departed like the rest of their compeers,<br/>
The peerage, to a mansion very fine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gothic Babel of a thousand years.<br/>
None than themselves could boast a longer line,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where time through heroes and through beauties steers;<br/>
And oaks as olden as their pedigree<br/>
Told of their sires, a tomb in every tree.

</p>
<p>
A paragraph in every paper told<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their departure: such is modern fame:<br/>
'T is pity that it takes no farther hold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than an advertisement, or much the same;<br/>
When, ere the ink be dry, the sound grows cold.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Morning Post was foremost to proclaim&mdash;<br/>
'Departure, for his country seat, to-day,<br/>
Lord H. Amundeville and Lady A.

</p>
<p>
'We understand the splendid host intends<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To entertain, this autumn, a select<br/>
And numerous party of his noble friends;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Midst whom we have heard, from sources quite correct,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With many more by rank and fashion deck'd;<br/>
Also a foreigner of high condition,<br/>
The envoy of the secret Russian mission.'

</p>
<p>
And thus we see&mdash;who doubts the Morning Post?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Whose articles are like the 'Thirty-nine,'<br/>
Which those most swear to who believe them most)&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our gay Russ Spaniard was ordain'd to shine,<br/>
Deck'd by the rays reflected from his host,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With those who, Pope says, 'greatly daring dine.'<br/>
'T is odd, but true,&mdash;last war the News abounded<br/>
More with these dinners than the kill'd or wounded;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
As thus: 'On Thursday there was a grand dinner;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Present, Lords A. B. C.'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Earls, dukes, by name<br/>
Announced with no less pomp than victory's winner:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then underneath, and in the very same<br/>
Column; date, 'Falmouth. There has lately been here<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Slap-dash regiment, so well known to fame,<br/>
Whose loss in the late action we regret:<br/>
The vacancies are fill'd up&mdash;see Gazette.'

</p>
<p>
To Norman Abbey whirl'd the noble pair,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An old, old monastery once, and now<br/>
Still older mansion; of a rich and rare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix'd Gothic, such as artists all allow<br/>
Few specimens yet left us can compare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Withal: it lies perhaps a little low,<br/>
Because the monks preferr'd a hill behind,<br/>
To shelter their devotion from the wind.

</p>
<p>
It stood embosom'd in a happy valley,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Crown'd by high woodlands, where the Druid oak<br/>
Stood like Caractacus in act to rally<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His host, with broad arms 'gainst the thunderstroke;<br/>
And from beneath his boughs were seen to sally<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dappled foresters&mdash;as day awoke,<br/>
The branching stag swept down with all his herd,<br/>
To quaff a brook which murmur'd like a bird.

</p>
<p>
Before the mansion lay a lucid lake,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad as transparent, deep, and freshly fed<br/>
By a river, which its soften'd way did take<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In currents through the calmer water spread<br/>
Around: the wildfowl nestled in the brake<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sedges, brooding in their liquid bed:<br/>
The woods sloped downwards to its brink, and stood<br/>
With their green faces fix'd upon the flood.

</p>
<p>
Its outlet dash'd into a deep cascade,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparkling with foam, until again subsiding,<br/>
Its shriller echoes&mdash;like an infant made<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet&mdash;sank into softer ripples, gliding<br/>
Into a rivulet; and thus allay'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursued its course, now gleaming, and now hiding<br/>
Its windings through the woods; now clear, now blue,<br/>
According as the skies their shadows threw.

</p>
<p>
A glorious remnant of the Gothic pile<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(While yet the church was Rome's) stood half apart<br/>
In a grand arch, which once screen'd many an aisle.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These last had disappear'd&mdash;a loss to art:<br/>
The first yet frown'd superbly o'er the soil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And kindled feelings in the roughest heart,<br/>
Which mourn'd the power of time's or tempest's march,<br/>
In gazing on that venerable arch.

</p>
<p>
Within a niche, nigh to its pinnacle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve saints had once stood sanctified in stone;<br/>
But these had fallen, not when the friars fell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the war which struck Charles from his throne,<br/>
When each house was a fortalice, as tell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The annals of full many a line undone,&mdash;<br/>
The gallant cavaliers, who fought in vain<br/>
For those who knew not to resign or reign.

</p>
<p>
But in a higher niche, alone, but crowned,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Virgin Mother of the God-born Child,<br/>
With her Son in her blessed arms, look'd round,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spared by some chance when all beside was spoil'd;<br/>
She made the earth below seem holy ground.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be superstition, weak or wild,<br/>
But even the faintest relics of a shrine<br/>
Of any worship wake some thoughts divine.

</p>
<p>
A mighty window, hollow in the centre,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shorn of its glass of thousand colourings,<br/>
Through which the deepen'd glories once could enter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaming from off the sun like seraph's wings,<br/>
Now yawns all desolate: now loud, now fainter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The gale sweeps through its fretwork, and oft sings<br/>
The owl his anthem, where the silenced quire<br/>
Lie with their hallelujahs quench'd like fire.

</p>
<p>
But in the noontide of the moon, and when<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is winged from one point of heaven,<br/>
There moans a strange unearthly sound, which then<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is musical&mdash;a dying accent driven<br/>
Through the huge arch, which soars and sinks again.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some deem it but the distant echo given<br/>
Back to the night wind by the waterfall,<br/>
And harmonised by the old choral wall:

</p>
<p>
Others, that some original shape, or form<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaped by decay perchance, hath given the power<br/>
(Though less than that of Memnon's statue, warm<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Egypt's rays, to harp at a fix'd hour)<br/>
To this grey ruin, with a voice to charm.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad, but serene, it sweeps o'er tree or tower;<br/>
The cause I know not, nor can solve; but such<br/>
The fact:<br/>
&mdash;I 've heard it&mdash;once perhaps too much.

</p>
<p>
Amidst the court a Gothic fountain play'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Symmetrical, but deck'd with carvings quaint&mdash;<br/>
Strange faces, like to men in masquerade,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And here perhaps a monster, there a saint:<br/>
The spring gush'd through grim mouths of granite made,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sparkled into basins, where it spent<br/>
Its little torrent in a thousand bubbles,<br/>
Like man's vain glory, and his vainer troubles.

</p>
<p>
The mansion's self was vast and venerable,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With more of the monastic than has been<br/>
Elsewhere preserved: the cloisters still were stable,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The cells, too, and refectory, I ween:<br/>
An exquisite small chapel had been able,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still unimpair'd, to decorate the scene;<br/>
The rest had been reform'd, replaced, or sunk,<br/>
And spoke more of the baron than the monk.

</p>
<p>
Huge halls, long galleries, spacious chambers, join'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By no quite lawful marriage of the arts,<br/>
Might shock a connoisseur; but when combined,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Form'd a whole which, irregular in parts,<br/>
Yet left a grand impression on the mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least of those whose eyes are in their hearts:<br/>
We gaze upon a giant for his stature,<br/>
Nor judge at first if all be true to nature.

</p>
<p>
Steel barons, molten the next generation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To silken rows of gay and garter'd earls,<br/>
Glanced from the walls in goodly preservation;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lady Marys blooming into girls,<br/>
With fair long locks, had also kept their station;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And countesses mature in robes and pearls:<br/>
Also some beauties of Sir Peter Lely,<br/>
Whose drapery hints we may admire them freely.

</p>
<p>
Judges in very formidable ermine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were there, with brows that did not much invite<br/>
The accused to think their lordships would determine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His cause by leaning much from might to right:<br/>
Bishops, who had not left a single sermon:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorneys-general, awful to the sight,<br/>
As hinting more (unless our judgments warp us)<br/>
Of the 'Star Chamber' than of 'Habeas Corpus.'

</p>
<p>
Generals, some all in armour, of the old<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And iron time, ere lead had ta'en the lead;<br/>
Others in wigs of Marlborough's martial fold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Huger than twelve of our degenerate breed:<br/>
Lordlings, with staves of white or keys of gold:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nimrods, whose canvass scarce contain'd the steed;<br/>
And here and there some stern high patriot stood,<br/>
Who could not get the place for which he sued.

</p>
<p>
But ever and anon, to soothe your vision,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatigued with these hereditary glories,<br/>
There rose a Carlo Dolce or a Titian,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wilder group of savage Salvatore's;<br/>
Here danced Albano's boys, and here the sea shone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Vernet's ocean lights; and there the stories<br/>
Of martyrs awed, as Spagnoletto tainted<br/>
His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.

</p>
<p>
Here sweetly spread a landscape of Lorraine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There Rembrandt made his darkness equal light,<br/>
Or gloomy Caravaggio's gloomier stain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bronzed o'er some lean and stoic anchorite:&mdash;<br/>
But, lo! a Teniers woos, and not in vain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your eyes to revel in a livelier sight:<br/>
His bell-mouth'd goblet makes me feel quite Danish<br/>
Or Dutch with thirst<br/>
&mdash;What, ho! a flask of Rhenish.

</p>
<p>
O reader! if that thou canst read,&mdash;and know,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is not enough to spell, or even to read,<br/>
To constitute a reader; there must go<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtues of which both you and I have need;&mdash;<br/>
Firstly, begin with the beginning (though<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That clause is hard); and secondly, proceed;<br/>
Thirdly, commence not with the end&mdash;or, sinning<br/>
In this sort, end at least with the beginning.

</p>
<p>
But, reader, thou hast patient been of late,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While I, without remorse of rhyme, or fear,<br/>
Have built and laid out ground at such a rate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan Phoebus takes me for an auctioneer.<br/>
That poets were so from their earliest date,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By Homer's 'Catalogue of ships' is clear;<br/>
But a mere modern must be moderate&mdash;<br/>
I spare you then the furniture and plate.

</p>
<p>
The mellow autumn came, and with it came<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The promised party, to enjoy its sweets.<br/>
The corn is cut, the manor full of game;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pointer ranges, and the sportsman beats<br/>
In russet jacket:&mdash;lynx-like is his aim;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full grows his bag, and wonderful his feats.<br/>
Ah, nut-brown partridges! Ah, brilliant pheasants!<br/>
And ah, ye poachers!&mdash;'T is no sport for peasants.

</p>
<p>
An English autumn, though it hath no vines,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blushing with Bacchant coronals along<br/>
The paths, o'er which the far festoon entwines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The red grape in the sunny lands of song,<br/>
Hath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The claret light, and the Madeira strong.<br/>
If Britain mourn her bleakness, we can tell her,<br/>
The very best of vineyards is the cellar.

</p>
<p>
Then, if she hath not that serene decline<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which makes the southern autumn's day appear<br/>
As if 't would to a second spring resign<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The season, rather than to winter drear,<br/>
Of in-door comforts still she hath a mine,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea-coal fires the 'earliest of the year;'<br/>
Without doors, too, she may compete in mellow,<br/>
As what is lost in green is gain'd in yellow.

</p>
<p>
And for the effeminate villeggiatura&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rife with more horns than hounds&mdash;she hath the chase,<br/>
So animated that it might allure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint from his beads to join the jocund race;<br/>
Even Nimrod's self might leave the plains of Dura,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wear the Melton jacket for a space:<br/>
If she hath no wild boars, she hath a tame<br/>
Preserve of bores, who ought to be made game.

</p>
<p>
The noble guests, assembled at the Abbey,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Consisted of&mdash;we give the sex the pas&mdash;<br/>
The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke; the Countess Crabby;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ladies Scilly, Busey;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Miss Eclat,<br/>
Miss Bombazeen, Miss Mackstay, Miss O'Tabby,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mrs. Rabbi, the rich banker's squaw;<br/>
Also the honourable Mrs. Sleep,<br/>
Who look'd a white lamb, yet was a black sheep:

</p>
<p>
With other Countesses of Blank&mdash;but rank;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At once the 'lie' and the 'elite' of crowds;<br/>
Who pass like water filter'd in a tank,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All purged and pious from their native clouds;<br/>
Or paper turn'd to money by the Bank:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how or why, the passport shrouds<br/>
The 'passee' and the past; for good society<br/>
Is no less famed for tolerance than piety,&mdash;

</p>
<p>
That is, up to a certain point; which point<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms the most difficult in punctuation.<br/>
Appearances appear to form the joint<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On which it hinges in a higher station;<br/>
And so that no explosion cry 'Aroint<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee, witch!' or each Medea has her Jason;<br/>
Or (to the point with Horace and with Pulci)<br/>
'Omne tulit punctum, quae miscuit utile dulci.'

</p>
<p>
I can't exactly trace their rule of right,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which hath a little leaning to a lottery.<br/>
I 've seen a virtuous woman put down quite<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the mere combination of a coterie;<br/>
Also a so-so matron boldly fight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,<br/>
And shine the very Siria of the spheres,<br/>
Escaping with a few slight, scarless sneers.

</p>
<p>
I have seen more than I 'll say:&mdash;but we will see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How our villeggiatura will get on.<br/>
The party might consist of thirty-three<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of highest caste&mdash;the Brahmins of the ton.<br/>
I have named a few, not foremost in degree,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But ta'en at hazard as the rhyme may run.<br/>
By way of sprinkling, scatter'd amongst these,<br/>
There also were some Irish absentees.

</p>
<p>
There was Parolles, too, the legal bully,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who limits all his battles to the bar<br/>
And senate: when invited elsewhere, truly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He shows more appetite for words than war.<br/>
There was the young bard Rackrhyme, who had newly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come out and glimmer'd as a six weeks' star.<br/>
There was Lord Pyrrho, too, the great freethinker;<br/>
And Sir John Pottledeep, the mighty drinker.

</p>
<p>
There was the Duke of Dash, who was a&mdash;duke,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ay, every inch a' duke; there were twelve peers<br/>
Like Charlemagne's&mdash;and all such peers in look<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And intellect, that neither eyes nor ears<br/>
For commoners had ever them mistook.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There were the six Miss Rawbolds&mdash;pretty dears!<br/>
All song and sentiment; whose hearts were set<br/>
Less on a convent than a coronet.

</p>
<p>
There were four Honourable Misters, whose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Honour was more before their names than after;<br/>
There was the preux Chevalier de la Ruse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom France and Fortune lately deign'd to waft here,<br/>
Whose chiefly harmless talent was to amuse;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the clubs found it rather serious laughter,<br/>
Because&mdash;such was his magic power to please&mdash;<br/>
The dice seem'd charm'd, too, with his repartees.

</p>
<p>
There was Dick Dubious, the metaphysician,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loved philosophy and a good dinner;<br/>
Angle, the soi-disant mathematician;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Henry Silvercup, the great race-winner.<br/>
There was the Reverend Rodomont Precisian,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who did not hate so much the sin as sinner;<br/>
And Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet,<br/>
Good at all things, but better at a bet.

</p>
<p>
There was jack jargon, the gigantic guardsman;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And General Fireface, famous in the field,<br/>
A great tactician, and no less a swordsman,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who ate, last war, more Yankees than he kill'd.<br/>
There was the waggish Welsh Judge, Jefferies Hardsman,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his grave office so completely skill'd,<br/>
That when a culprit came far condemnation,<br/>
He had his judge's joke for consolation.

</p>
<p>
Good company 's a chess-board&mdash;there are kings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, bishops, knights, rooks, pawns; the world 's a game;<br/>
Save that the puppets pull at their own strings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Methinks gay Punch hath something of the same.<br/>
My Muse, the butterfly hath but her wings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not stings, and flits through ether without aim,<br/>
Alighting rarely:&mdash;were she but a hornet,<br/>
Perhaps there might be vices which would mourn it.

</p>
<p>
I had forgotten&mdash;but must not forget&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An orator, the latest of the session,<br/>
Who had deliver'd well a very set<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth speech, his first and maidenly transgression<br/>
Upon debate: the papers echoed yet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his debut, which made a strong impression,<br/>
And rank'd with what is every day display'd&mdash;<br/>
'The best first speech that ever yet was made.'

</p>
<p>
Proud of his 'Hear hims!' proud, too, of his vote<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lost virginity of oratory,<br/>
Proud of his learning (just enough to quote),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He revell'd in his Ciceronian glory:<br/>
With memory excellent to get by rote,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With wit to hatch a pun or tell a story,<br/>
Graced with some merit, and with more effrontery,<br/>
'His country's pride,' he came down to the country.

</p>
<p>
There also were two wits by acclamation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Longbow from Ireland, Strongbow from the Tweed,<br/>
Both lawyers and both men of education;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Strongbow's wit was of more polish'd breed:<br/>
Longbow was rich in an imagination<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As beautiful and bounding as a steed,<br/>
But sometimes stumbling over a potato,&mdash;<br/>
While Strongbow's best things might have come from Cato.

</p>
<p>
Strongbow was like a new-tuned harpsichord;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Longbow wild as an AEolian harp,<br/>
With which the winds of heaven can claim accord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And make a music, whether flat or sharp.<br/>
Of Strongbow's talk you would not change a word:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At Longbow's phrases you might sometimes carp:<br/>
Both wits&mdash;one born so, and the other bred&mdash;<br/>
This by his heart, his rival by his head.

</p>
<p>
If all these seem a heterogeneous mas<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be assembled at a country seat,<br/>
Yet think, a specimen of every class<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is better than a humdrum tete-a-tete.<br/>
The days of Comedy are gone, alas!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When Congreve's fool could vie with Moliere's bete:<br/>
Society is smooth'd to that excess,<br/>
That manners hardly differ more than dress.

</p>
<p>
Our ridicules are kept in the back-ground&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ridiculous enough, but also dull;<br/>
Professions, too, are no more to be found<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional; and there is nought to cull<br/>
Of folly's fruit; for though your fools abound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They're barren, and not worth the pains to pull.<br/>
Society is now one polish'd horde,<br/>
Form'd of two mighty tribes, the Bores and Bored.

</p>
<p>
But from being farmers, we turn gleaners, gleaning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The scanty but right-well thresh'd ears of truth;<br/>
And, gentle reader! when you gather meaning,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may be Boaz, and <em>I&mdash;</em>modest Ruth.<br/>
Farther I 'd quote, but Scripture intervening<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forbids. Its great impression in my youth<br/>
Was made by Mrs. Adams, where she cries,<br/>
'That Scriptures out of church are blasphemies.'

</p>
<p>
But what we can we glean in this vile age<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of chaff, although our gleanings be not grist.<br/>
I must not quite omit the talking sage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kit-Cat, the famous Conversationist,<br/>
Who, in his common-place book, had a page<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepared each morn for evenings. 'List, oh, list!'-<br/>
'Alas, poor ghost!'<br/>
&mdash;What unexpected woes<br/>
Await those who have studied their bon-mots!

</p>
<p>
Firstly, they must allure the conversation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By many windings to their clever clinch;<br/>
And secondly, must let slip no occasion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor bate (abate) their hearers of an inch,<br/>
But take an ell&mdash;and make a great sensation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If possible; and thirdly, never flinch<br/>
When some smart talker puts them to the test,<br/>
But seize the last word, which no doubt 's the best.

</p>
<p>
Lord Henry and his lady were the hosts;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The party we have touch'd on were the guests:<br/>
Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.<br/>
I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Albeit all human history attests<br/>
That happiness for man&mdash;the hungry sinner!-<br/>
Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.

</p>
<p>
Witness the lands which 'flow'd with milk and honey,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Held out unto the hungry Israelites;<br/>
To this we have added since, the love of money,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The only sort of pleasure which requites.<br/>
Youth fades, and leaves our days no longer sunny;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We tire of mistresses and parasites;<br/>
But oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?<br/>
When we no more can use, or even abuse thee!

</p>
<p>
The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hunt: the young, because they liked the sport&mdash;<br/>
The first thing boys like after play and fruit;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged to make the day more short;<br/>
For ennui is a growth of English root,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though nameless in our language:&mdash;we retort<br/>
The fact for words, and let the French translate<br/>
That awful yawn which sleep can not abate.

</p>
<p>
The elderly walk'd through the library,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,<br/>
Or saunter'd through the gardens piteously,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And made upon the hot-house several strictures,<br/>
Or rode a nag which trotted not too high,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or on the morning papers read their lectures,<br/>
Or on the watch their longing eyes would fix,<br/>
Longing at sixty for the hour of six.

</p>
<p>
But none were 'gene:' the great hour of union<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was rung by dinner's knell; till then all were<br/>
Masters of their own time&mdash;or in communion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or solitary, as they chose to bear<br/>
The hours, which how to pass is but to few known.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each rose up at his own, and had to spare<br/>
What time he chose for dress, and broke his fast<br/>
When, where, and how he chose for that repast.

</p>
<p>
The ladies&mdash;some rouged, some a little pale&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Met the morn as they might. If fine, they rode,<br/>
Or walk'd; if foul, they read, or told a tale,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sung, or rehearsed the last dance from abroad;<br/>
Discuss'd the fashion which might next prevail,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And settled bonnets by the newest code,<br/>
Or cramm'd twelve sheets into one little letter,<br/>
To make each correspondent a new debtor.

</p>
<p>
For some had absent lovers, all had friends.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth has nothing like a she epistle,<br/>
And hardly heaven&mdash;because it never ends.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love the mystery of a female missal,<br/>
Which, like a creed, ne'er says all it intends,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But full of cunning as Ulysses' whistle,<br/>
When he allured poor Dolon:&mdash;you had better<br/>
Take care what you reply to such a letter.

</p>
<p>
Then there were billiards; cards, too, but no dice;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save in the clubs no man of honour plays;&mdash;<br/>
Boats when 't was water, skating when 't was ice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hard frost destroy'd the scenting days:<br/>
And angling, too, that solitary vice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever Izaak Walton sings or says;<br/>
The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, in his gullet<br/>
Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.

</p>
<p>
With evening came the banquet and the wine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversazione; the duet,<br/>
Attuned by voices more or less divine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(My heart or head aches with the memory yet).<br/>
The four Miss Rawbolds in a glee would shine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two youngest loved more to be set<br/>
Down to the harp&mdash;because to music's charms<br/>
They added graceful necks, white hands and arms.

</p>
<p>
Sometimes a dance (though rarely on field days,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For then the gentlemen were rather tired)<br/>
Display'd some sylph-like figures in its maze;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was small-talk ready when required;<br/>
Flirtation&mdash;but decorous; the mere praise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of charms that should or should not be admired.<br/>
The hunters fought their fox-hunt o'er again,<br/>
And then retreated soberly&mdash;at ten.

</p>
<p>
The politicians, in a nook apart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Discuss'd the world, and settled all the spheres;<br/>
The wits watch'd every loophole for their art,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To introduce a bon-mot head and ears;<br/>
Small is the rest of those who would be smart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment's good thing may have cost them years<br/>
Before they find an hour to introduce it;<br/>
And then, even then, some bore may make them lose it.

</p>
<p>
But all was gentle and aristocratic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this our party; polish'd, smooth, and cold,<br/>
As Phidian forms cut out of marble Attic.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There now are no Squire Westerns as of old;<br/>
And our Sophias are not so emphatic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But fair as then, or fairer to behold.<br/>
We have no accomplish'd blackguards, like Tom Jones,<br/>
But gentlemen in stays, as stiff as stones.

</p>
<p>
They separated at an early hour;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, ere midnight&mdash;which is London's noon:<br/>
But in the country ladies seek their bower<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A little earlier than the waning moon.<br/>
Peace to the slumbers of each folded flower&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May the rose call back its true colour soon!<br/>
Good hours of fair cheeks are the fairest tinters,<br/>
And lower the price of rouge&mdash;at least some winters.
