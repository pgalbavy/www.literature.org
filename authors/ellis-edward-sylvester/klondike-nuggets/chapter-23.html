<p>Quick as were the boys in hurrying to the point where they heard
the indignant Tim, they did not reach it until the affray was
over. Wholly subdued, Ike Hardman begged for mercy at the hands
of his conqueror, and promised to do anything desired if he received
consideration.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that the wrath of a good-natured person
is more to be feared than his who is of less equable temperament.
The boys had never seen Tim McCabe in so dangerous a mood. He
and Jeff Graham had returned to the cavern shortly after the departure
of the cousins in pursuit of the thieves, and it did not take
them long to understand what had occurred. They set out over the
same trail, along which they readily discovered the footprints
of all the parties. Tim, in his angry impatience, outsped his
more stolid companion, and by good fortune came upon Hardman while
in headlong flight down the mountain path.</p>

<p>The latter tried for a time to make it appear that he knew nothing
of the abstraction of the gold from the cavern, but Tim would
have none of it, and gave him the choice of conducting them to
the place where it was concealed or of undergoing "capital punishment."
Like the poltroon that he was, Hardman insisted that his companion,
Victor Herzog, was the real wrongdoer, but he offered to do what
was demanded, only imploring that he should not be harmed for
his evil acts.</p>

<p>Tim extended his hand and took the Winchester from Frank Mansley.
He knew it was loaded, and he said to his prisoner:</p>

<p>"Lead on, and if ye think it will pay ye to try to git away or
play any of yer tricks, why try it, that's all!"</p>

<p>The threat was sufficient to banish all hope from Hardman, who
led them along the trail a short way, then turned on to the pile
of rocks beside which Frank had seen him standing a short time
before.</p>

<p>"There it is!" he said, with an apprehensive glance at his captor.</p>

<p>"Where?" thundered Tim; "I don't see it!"</p>

<p>No digging had been done by the criminals, but a bowlder had
been rolled aside, the canvas bags dropped into the opening, and
the stone replaced, as he quickly demonstrated.</p>

<p>"Count 'em, Roswell," said Tim.</p>

<p>Both boys leaned over, and moving the heavy sacks about so as
not to miss one, announced that all were there.</p>

<p>"And now I s'pose I may go," whined Hardman.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. I won't make a target of ye fer this gun, but
ye shall remain me prisoner till I turn ye over to the police."</p>

<p>Thereupon Hardman begged so piteously that the boys interceded
and asked that he be allowed to go, but Tim sternly bade them
hold their peace. The bowlder having been replaced, while he glanced
around to fix the locality in his memory, he ordered the captive
to precede him down the trail, reminding him at the same time
that the first attempt on his part to escape would be followed
by the instant discharge of the gun.</p>

<p>Thus, as the long afternoon drew to a close the strange procession
wound its way down the mountain, the prisoner in front, his captors
directly behind, with Frank and Roswell bringing up the rear.
The boys talked in whispers, but said nothing to their friend,
who was in such a stern mood that they shrank from speaking to
him.</p>

<p>They speculated as to the fate of Herzog, the other criminal,
who seemed to have effected his escape, but recalled that Jeff
Graham was likely to be met somewhere along the path, and it might
be that this had occurred with disastrous results to the evil
fellow, for it will be remembered that the old miner was one of
the few who always carried their revolvers with them.</p>

<p>The expectation of the boys was not disappointed. When about
half way down the trail they came upon Jeff, who had his man secure,
thanks to the good fortune which gave him an advantage of which
he instantly availed himself.</p>

<p>Roswell and Frank thought that when Jeff learned that all the
stolen gold had been recovered he would be willing to release
the prisoners, but such intention was as far from him as from
Tim McCabe. While he had no desire for revenge, he felt it would
be wrong to set the evil-doers free, and he knew that they would
receive the punishment they had well earned as soon as placed
within the power of the law.</p>

<p>It was beginning to grow dark when the party reached their cabin.
Just before reaching it they crossed the pasturage ground of the
burro, who was seen quietly browsing, as if he had not taken any
part and felt no interest in the proceedings of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Halting in front of the opening, Jeff said to Tim:</p>

<p>"You have the gun and know it's a repeater."</p>

<p>The Irishman nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Keep guard over these fellows till I come back; it won't be
long."</p>

<p>"I'll do the same&mdash;on that ye may depind."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>TIM AND HIS PRISONERS</em>.]</p>

<p>The massive figure swung off in the gloom. He gave no intimation
of whither he was going, and no one could guess, except that he
promised shortly to return.</p>

<p>A few minutes after his departure, both Hardman and Herzog renewed
their pleadings for mercy&mdash;for at least they suspected the cause
of the old miner's departure&mdash;but Tim checked them so promptly
that they held their peace.</p>

<p>At his suggestion, the boys started a fire and began preparing
supper. They had hardly completed the task when Jeff Graham reappeared
and he brought two companions with him. Though they were on foot,
they were members of the mounted police, whose horses were but
a short distance away. In the discharge of their duties, they
were on a tour among the diggings to learn whether there was any
call for their services. Jeff had seen them during the afternoon,
and knew where to look for them.</p>

<p>There was no nonsense about those sturdy fellows. They made their
living by compelling obedience to the laws of their country, and
were always prepared to do their duty. At the suggestion of Jeff,
they questioned the men, who admitted their guilt, supplementing
the confession with another appeal for clemency. Without deigning
a reply, the officers slipped handcuffs upon them, and declining
the invitation to remain to supper, departed with their prisoners,
whom they delivered to the authorities at Dawson City on the following
day. Since they had admitted their guilt, our friends were not
required to appear as witnesses, and the case may be closed by
the statement that Hardman and Herzog received the full punishment
which they deserved.</p>

<p>When the evening meal was finished, the men and boys remained
outside in the cool, clear air, the former smoking their pipes,
and all discussing the stirring events of the day. The boys confessed
their neglect in failing to make known the presence of Herzog
in the neighborhood, because the fact was driven from their minds
by their excitement over the discovery of gold.</p>

<p>"Had we done as we ought," said Frank, "it isn't likely this
would have happened."</p>

<p>"You are right," replied Jeff, "for we should have been more
watchful."</p>

<p>"And wasn't it oursilves that was careless, anyway, in laying
so much wilth where any one could git at the same?" asked Tim.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted the old miner, "but things are different here
from what they was in the early days in Californy, and you can
see that these two men are the only ones that would steal our
stuff."</p>

<p>"At prisint they saam to be the only ones, but we can't be sure
that ithers wouldn't have tried to do the same."</p>

<p>"Well, boys," was the surprising announcement of Jeff Graham,
"to-morrow we leave this place for good and take the next steamer
down the Yukon for home; our hunt for gold is done!"</p>
