<P>Kachgaria is Oriental Turkestan which is gradually being metamorphosed into
Russian Turkestan.</P>
<P>The writers in the <I>New Review</I> have said: &quot;Central Asia will only be a
great country when the Muscovite administration have laid hands on Tibet, or
when the Russians lord it at Kachgar.&quot;</P>
<P>Well, that is a thing half done! The piercing of the Pamir has joined the
Russian railway with the Chinese line which runs from one frontier of the
Celestial Empire to the other. The capital of Kachgaria is now as much Russian
as Chinese. The Sclav race and the Yellow race have rubbed elbows and live in
peace. How long will it last? To others leave the future; I am content with the
present.</P>
<P>We arrive at half-past four; we leave at eleven. The Grand Transasiatic shows
itself generous. I shall have time to see Kachgar, on condition of allowing
myself an hour less than the time stated.</P>
<P>For what was not done at the frontier has to be done at Kachgar. Russians and
Chinese are one as bad as the other when there are vexing formalities; papers to
verify, passports to sign, etc., etc. It is the same sort of meddling, minute
and over-fastidious, and we must put up with it. We must not forget the terrible
threat of the formula the functionary of the Celestial Empire affixes to his
acts&mdash;&quot;Tremble and obey!&quot; I am disposed to obey, and I am prepared to appear
before the authorities of the frontier. I remember the fears of Kinko, and it is
with regard to him that the trembling is to be done, if the examination of the
travelers extends to their packages and luggage.</P>
<P>Before we reached Kachgar, Major Noltitz said to me:</P>
<P>&quot;Do not imagine that Chinese Turkestan differs very much from Russian
Turkestan. We are not in the land of pagodas, junks, flower boats, yamens, hongs
and porcelain towers. Like Bokhara, Merv and Samarkand, Kachgar is a double
town. It is with the Central Asian cities as it is with certain stars, only they
do not revolve round one another.&quot;</P>
<P>The major&apos;s remark was very true. It was not so long ago since emirs reigned
over Kachgaria, since the monarchy of Mohammed Yakoub extended over the whole of
Turkestan, since the Chinese who wished to live here had to adjure the religion
of Buddha and Confucius and become converts to Mahometanism, that is, if they
wished to be respectable. What would you have? In these days we are always too
late, and those marvels of the Oriental cosmorama, those curious manners, those
masterpieces of Asiatic art, are either memories or ruins. The railways will end
by bringing the countries they traverse down to the same level, to a mutual
resemblance which will certainly be equality and may be fraternity. In truth,
Kachgar is no longer the capital of Kachgaria; it is a station on the Grand
Transasiatic, the junction between the Russian and Chinese lines, and the strip
of iron which stretches for three thousand kilometres from the Caspian to this
city runs on for nearly four thousand more to the capital of the Celestial
Empire.</P>
<P>I return to the double town. The new one is Yangi-Chahr: the old one, three
and a half miles off, is Kachgar. I have seen both, and I will tell you what
they are like.</P>
<P>In the first place, both the old and the new towns are surrounded with a
villainous earthen wall that does not predispose you in their favor. Secondly,
it is in vain that you seek for any monument whatever, for the materials of
construction are identical for houses as for palaces. Nothing but earth, and not
even baked earth. It is not with mud dried in the sun that you can obtain
regular lines, clean profiles and finely worked sculptures. Your architecture
must be in stone or marble, and that is precisely what you do not get in Chinese
Turkestan.</P>
<P>A small carriage quickly took the major and myself to Kachgar, which is three
miles round. The Kizil-Sou, that is to say the Red River, which is really
yellow, as a Chinese river ought to be, clasps it between its two arms, which
are united by two bridges. If you wish to see a few ruins of some interest, you
must go a short distance beyond the town, where there are the remains of
fortifications dating from five hundred or two thousand years ago, according to
the imagination of the archaeologist. What is certain is that Kachgar submitted
to the furious assault of Tamerlane, and we will agree that without the exploits
of this terrible cripple the history of Central Asia would be singularly
monotonous. Since his time there have been fierce sultans, it is true&mdash;among
others that Ouali-Khan-Toulla, who, in 1857, strangled Schlagintweit, one of the
most learned and most daring explorers of the Asiatic continent. Two tablets of
bronze, presented by the Geographical Societies of Paris and Petersburg,
ornament his commemorative monument.</P>
<P>Kachgar is an important centre of trade, which is almost entirely in Russian
hands. Khotan silks, cotton, felt, woolen carpets, cloth, are the principal
articles in the markets, and these are exported beyond the frontier between
Tachkend and Koulja, to the north of Oriental Turkestan.</P>
<P>Here, as the major told me, Sir Francis Trevellyan should have special cause
for manifesting his ill humor. In fact, an English embassy under Chapman and
Gordon in 1873 and 1874 had been sent from Kashmir to Kachgar by way of Kothan
and Yarkand. At this time the English had reason to hope that commercial
relations could be established to their advantage. But instead of being in
communication with the Indian railways, the Russian railways are in
communication with the Chinese, and the result of this junction has been that
English influence has had to give place to Russian.</P>
<P>The population of Kachgar is Turkoman, with a considerable mixture of
Chinese, who willingly fulfil the duties of domestics, artisans or porters. Less
fortunate than Chapman and Gordon, Major Noltitz and I were not able to see the
Kachgarian capital when the armies of the tumultuous emir filled its streets.
There were none of those Djiguit foot soldiers who were mounted, nor of those
Sarbaz who were not. Vanished had those magnificent bodies of Taifourchis, armed
and disciplined in the Chinese manner, those superb lancers, those Kalmuck
archers, bending bows five feet high, those &quot;tigers&quot; with their daubed shields
and their matchlocks. All have disappeared, the picturesque warriors of
Kachgaria and the emir with them.</P>
<P>At nine o&apos;clock we are on our return to Yangi-Chahr. There, at the end of the
streets near the citadel, what do we see? The Caternas in ecstatic admiration
before a troop of musical dervishes.</P>
<P>Who says dervish says beggar, and who says beggar evokes the completest type
of filth and laziness. But with what an extraordinary combination of gestures,
with what attitudes in the management of the long-stringed guitar, with what
acrobatic swingings of the body do they accompany their singing of their legends
and poetry which could not be more profane. The instinct of the old actor was
awakened in Caterna. He could not keep still; it was too much for him.</P>
<P>And so these gestures, these attitudes, these swingings he imitated there
with the vigor of an old topman joined to that of a leading premier, and I saw
him as he was figuring in this quadrille of dancing dervishes.</P>
<P>&quot;Eh! Monsieur Claudius!&quot; he said, &quot;it is not difficult to copy the exercises
of these gallant fellows! Make me a Turkestan operetta, let me act a dervish,
and you will see if I don&apos;t do it to the very life.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not doubt it, my dear Caterna,&quot; I replied; &quot;but before you do that,
come into the restaurant at the railway station and bid farewell to Turkestan
cookery, for we shall soon be reduced to Chinese.&quot;</P>
<P>The offer is accepted all the more willingly, for the reputation of the
Kachgarian cooks is well justified, as the major made us remark.</P>
<P>In fact, the Caternas, the major, young Pan Chao and I were astonished and
enchanted at the quantity of dishes that were served us, as well as at their
quality. Sweets alternated capriciously with roasts and grills. And as the
Caternas could never forget&mdash;any more than they could forget the famous peaches
of Khodjend&mdash;there are a few of these dishes which the English embassy wished to
retain in remembrance, for they have given the composition in the story of their
journey: pigs&apos; feet dusted with sugar and browned in fat with a dash of pickles;
kidneys fried with sweet sauce and served with fritters.</P>
<P>Caterna asked for the first twice, and for the other three times.</P>
<P>&quot;I take my precautions,&quot; said he. &quot;Who knows what the dining-car kitchen will
give us on the Chinese railways? Let us beware of shark fins, which may perhaps
be rather horny, and of swallows&apos; nests which may not be quite fresh!&quot;</P>
<P>It is ten o&apos;clock when a stroke of the gong announces that the police
formalities are about to begin. We leave the table after a parting glass of
Choa-Hing wine, and a few minutes afterward are in the waiting room.</P>
<P>All my numbers are present, with the exception, of course, of Kinko, who
would have done honor to our breakfast if it had been possible for him to take
part in it. There was Doctor Tio-King, his <I>Cornaro</I> under his arm; Fulk
Ephrinell and Miss Horatia Bluett, mingling their teeth and hair, figuratively,
be it understood; Sir Francis Trevellyan, motionless and silent, intractable and
stiff, smoking his cigar on the threshold; Faruskiar, accompanied by Ghangir;
Russian, Turkoman, Chinese travelers&mdash;in all from sixty to eighty persons. Every
one had in his turn to present himself at the table, which was occupied by two
Celestials in uniform; a functionary speaking Russian fluently, an interpreter
for German, French and English.</P>
<P>The Chinese was a man about fifty, with a bald head, a thick moustache, a
long pigtail, and spectacles on his nose. Wrapped in a flowery robe, fat as if
he belonged to the most distinguished people in the country, he had not a
prepossessing face. After all, it was only a verification of our papers, and as
ours were in order it did not much matter how repulsive he looked.</P>
<P>&quot;What an air he has!&quot; murmured Madame Caterna.</P>
<P>&quot;The air of a Chinaman!&quot; said her husband, &quot;and frankly I do not want to have
one like it.&quot;</P>
<P>I am one of the first to present my passport, which bears the visas of the
consul at Tiflis and the Russian authorities at Uzun-Ada. The functionary looks
at it attentively. When you are dealing with a mandarin, you should always be on
the lookout. Nevertheless, the examination raises no difficulty, and the seal of
the green dragon declares me all in order.</P>
<P>The same result with regard to the actor and actress. Nevertheless it was
worth while looking at Caterna while his papers were being examined. He assumed
the attitude of a criminal endeavoring to mollify a magistrate, he made the
sheepiest of eyes, and smiled the most deprecating of smiles, and seemed to
implore a grace or rather a favor, and yet the most obdurate of the Chinamen had
not a word to say to him.</P>
<P>&quot;Correct,&quot; said the interpreter.</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, my prince!&quot; replied Caterna, with the accent of a Paris street
boy.</P>
<P>As to Ephrinell and Miss Bluett, they went through like a posted letter. If
an American commercial and an English ditto were not in order, who would be?
Uncle Sam and John Bull are one as far as that goes.</P>
<P>The other travelers, Russian and Turkoman, underwent examination without any
difficulty arising. Whether they were first-class or second-class, they had
fulfilled the conditions required by the Chinese administration, which levies a
rather heavy fee for each visa, payable in roubles, taels or sapeks.</P>
<P>Among the travelers I noticed an American clergyman bound to Pekin. This was
the Reverend Nathaniel Morse, of Boston, one of those honest Bible distributors,
a Yankee missionary, in the garb of a merchant, and very keen in business
matters. At a venture I make him No. 13 in my notebook.</P>
<P>The verification of the papers of young Pan Chao and Doctor Tio-King gave
rise to no difficulty, and on leaving they exchanged &quot;ten thousand good
mornings&quot; with the more amiable of the Chinese representatives.</P>
<P>When it came to the turn of Major Noltitz, a slight incident occurred. Sir
Francis Trevellyan, who came to the table at the same moment, did not seem
inclined to give way. However, nothing resulted but haughty and provoking looks.
The gentleman did not even take the trouble to open his mouth. It is evidently
written above that I am not to hear the sound of his voice! The Russian and the
Englishman each received the regulation visa, and the affair went no
further.</P>
<P>My lord Faruskiar, followed by Ghangir, then arrived before the man in
spectacles, who looked at him with a certain amount of attention. Major Noltitz
and I watched him. How would he submit to this examination? Perhaps we were to
be undeceived regarding him.</P>
<P>But what was our surprise and even our stupefaction at the dramatic outburst
which at once took place!</P>
<P>After throwing a glance at the papers presented to him by Ghangir, the
Chinese functionary rose and bowed respectfully to Faruskiar, saying:</P>
<P>&quot;May the General Manager of the Grand Transasiatic deign to receive my ten
thousand respects!&quot;</P>
<P>General Manager, that is what he is, this lord Faruskiar! All is explained.
During our crossing of Russian Turkestan he had maintained his <I>incognito</I>
like a great personage in a foreign country; but now on the Chinese railways he
resumed the rank which belonged to him.</P>
<P>And I&mdash;in a joke, it is true&mdash;had permitted myself to identify him with the
pirate Ki-Tsang. And Major Noltitz, who had spent his time suspecting him! At
last I have some one of note in our train&mdash;I have him, this somebody, I will make
his acquaintance, I will cultivate it like a rare plant, and if he will only
speak Russian I will interview him down to his boots!</P>
<P>Good! I am completely upset, and I could not help shrugging my shoulders,
when the major whispers to me:</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps one of the bandit chiefs with whom the Grand Transasiatic had to
make terms!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Come, major, be serious.&quot;</P>
<P>The visit was nearing its end when Baron Weissschnitzerdörfer appeared.</P>
<P>He is preoccupied, he is troubled, he is anxious, he is confused, he is
fidgety. Why is he shaking, and bending, and diving into his pockets like a man
who has lost something valuable?</P>
<P>&quot;Your papers!&quot; demands the interpreter in German.</P>
<P>&quot;My papers!&quot; replies the baron, &quot;I am looking for them. I have not got them;
they were in my letter case.&quot;</P>
<P>And he dived again into his trousers pockets, his waistcoat pockets, his coat
pockets, his great-coat pockets&mdash;there were twenty of them at the least&mdash;and he
found nothing.</P>
<P>&quot;Be quick&mdash;be quick!&quot; said the interpreter. &quot;The train cannot wait!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I object to its going without me!&quot; exclaimed the baron. &quot;These papers&mdash;how
have they gone astray? I must have let them drop out of my case. They should
have given them back to me&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>At this moment the gong awoke the echoes of the interior of the railway
station.</P>
<P>&quot;Wait! wait! Donner vetter! Can&apos;t you wait a few moments for a man who is
going round the world in thirty-nine days&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Grand Transasiatic does not wait,&quot; says the interpreter.</P>
<P>Without waiting for any more, Major Noltitz and I reach the platform, while
the baron continues to struggle in the presence of the impassible Chinese
functionaries.</P>
<P>I examine the train and see that its composition has been modified on account
of there being fewer travelers between Kachgar and Pekin. Instead of twelve
carriages, there are now only ten, placed in the following order: engine,
tender, front van, two first-class cars, dining car, two second-class cars, the
van with the defunct mandarin, rear van.</P>
<P>The Russian locomotives, which have brought us from Uzun-Ada, have been
replaced by a Chinese locomotive, burning not naphtha but coal, of which there
are large deposits in Turkestan, and stores at the chief stations along the
line.</P>
<P>My first care is to look in at the front van. The custom-house officers are
about to visit it, and I tremble for poor Kinko.</P>
<P>It is evident that the fraud has not been discovered yet, for there would
have been a great stir at the news. Suppose the case is passed? Will its
position be shifted? Will it be put hind side before or upside down? Kinko will
not then be able to get out, and that would be a complication.</P>
<P>The Chinese officers have come out of the van and shut the door, so that I
cannot give a glance into it. The essential point is that Kinko has not been
caught in the act. As soon as possible I will enter the van, and as bankers say,
&quot;verify the state of the safe.&quot;</P>
<P>Before getting into our car, Major Noltitz asks me to follow him to the rear
of the train.</P>
<P>The scene we witness is not devoid of interest; it is the giving over of the
corpse of the mandarin Yen Lou by the Persian guards to a detachment of soldiers
of the Green Standard, who form the Chinese gendarmerie. The defunct passes into
the care of twenty Celestials, who are to occupy the second-class car in front
of the mortuary van. They are armed with guns and revolvers, and commanded by an
officer.</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said I to the major, &quot;this mandarin must be some very exalted
personage if the Son of Heaven sends him a guard of honor&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Or of defence,&quot; replies the major.</P>
<P>Faruskiar and Ghangir assist at these proceedings, in which there is nothing
surprising. Surely the general manager of the line ought to keep an eye on the
illustrious defunct, entrusted to the care of the Grand Transasiatic?</P>
<P>The gong was struck for the last time; we hasten into our cars.</P>
<P>And the baron, what has become of him?</P>
<P>Here he comes out on to the platform like a whirlwind. He has found his
papers at the bottom of his nineteenth pocket. He has obtained the necessary
visa&mdash;and it was time.</P>
<P>&quot;Passengers for Pekin, take your seats!&quot; shouts Popof in a sonorous
voice.</P>
<P>The train trembles, it starts, it has gone.</P>
