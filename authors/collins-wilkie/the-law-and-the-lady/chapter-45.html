<P>
 My head turned giddy. I was obliged to wait and let my
overpowering agitation subside, before I could read any more.
<P>
Looking at the letter again, after an interval, my eyes fell
accidentally on a sentence near the end, which surprised and
startled me.
<P>
I stopped the driver of the carriage, at the entrance to the
street in which our lodgings were situated, and told him to take
me to the beautiful park of Paris--the famous Bois de Boulogne.
My object was to gain time enough, in this way, to read the
letter carefully through by myself, and to ascertain whether I
ought or ought not to keep the receipt of it a secret before I
confronted my husband and his mother at home.
<P>
This precaution taken, I read the narrative which my good
Benjamin had so wisely and so thoughtfully written for me.
Treating the various incidents methodically, he began with the
Report which had arrived, in due course of mail, from our agent
in America.
<P>
Our man had successfully traced the lodgekeeper's daughter and
her husband to a small town in one of the Western States. Mr.
Playmore's letter of introduction at once secured him a cordial
reception from the married pair, and a patient hearing when he
stated the object of his voyage across the Atlantic.
<P>
His first questions led to no very encouraging results. The woman
was confused and surprised, and was apparently quite unable to
exert her memory to any useful purpose. Fortunately, her husband
proved to be a very intelligent man. He took the agent privately
aside, and said to him, "I understand my wife, and you don't.
Tell me exactly what it is you want to know, and leave it to me
to discover how much she remembers and how much she forgets."
<P>
This sensible suggestion was readily accepted. The agent waited
for events a day and a night.
<P>
Early the next morning the husband said to him, "Talk to my wife
now, and you'll find she has something to tell you. Only mind
this. Don't laugh at her when she speaks of trifles. She is half
ashamed to speak of trifles, even to me. Thinks men are above
such matters, you know. Listen quietly, and let her talk--and you
will get at it all in that way."
<P>
The agent followed his instructions, and "got at it" as follows:
<P>
The woman remembered, perfectly well, being sent to clean the
bedrooms and put them tidy, after the gentlefolks had all left
Gleninch. Her mother had a bad hip at the time, and could not go
with her and help her. She did not much fancy being alone in the
great house, after what had happened in it. On her way to her
work she passed two of the cottagers' children in the
neighborhood at play in the park. Mr. Macallan was always kind to
his poor tenants, and never objected to the young ones round
about having a run on the grass. The two children idly followed
her to the house. She took them inside, along with her--not
liking the place, as already mentioned, and feeling that they
would be company in the solitary rooms.
<P>
She began her work in the Guests' Corridor--leaving the room in
the other corridor, in which the death had happened, to the last.
<P>
There was very little to do in the two first rooms. There was not
litter enough, when she had swept the floors and cleaned the
grates, to even half fill the housemaid's bucket which she
carried with her. The children followed her about; and, all
things considered, were "very good company" in the lonely place.
<P>
The third room (that is to say, the bedchamber which had been
occupied by Miserrimus Dexter was in a much worse state than the
other two, and wanted a great deal of tidying. She did not much
notice the children here, being occupied with her work. The
litter was swept up from the carpet, and the cinders and ashes
were taken out of the grate, and the whole of it was in the
bucket, when her attention was recalled to the children by
hearing one of them cry.
<P>
She looked about the room without at first discovering them.
<P>
A fresh outburst of crying led her in the right direction, and
showed her the children under a table in a corner of the room.
The youngest of the two had got into a waste-paper basket. The
eldest had found an old bottle of gum, with a brush fixed in the
cork, and was gravely painting the face of the smaller child with
what little remained of the contents of the bottle. Some natural
struggles, on the part of the little creature, had ended in the
overthrow of the basket, and the usual outburst of crying had
followed as a matter of course.
<P>
In this state of things the remedy was soon applied. The woman
took the bottle away from the eldest child, and gave it a "box on
the ear." The younger one she set on its legs again, and she put
the two "in the corner" to keep them quiet. This done, she swept
up such fragments of the torn paper in the basket as had fallen
on the floor; threw them back again into the basket, along with
the gum-bottle; fetched the bucket, and emptied the basket into
it; and then proceeded to the fourth and last room in the
corridor, where she finished her work for that day.
<P>
Leaving the house, with the children after her, she took the
filled bucket to the dust-heap, and emptied it in a hollow place
among the rubbish, about half-way up the mound. Then she took the
children home; and there was an end of it for the day.
<P>
Such was the result of the appeal made to the woman's memory of
domestic events at Gleninch.
<P>
The conclusion at which Mr. Playmore arrived, from the facts
submitted to him, was that the chances were now decidedly in
favor of the recovery of the letter. Thrown in, nearly midway
between the contents of the housemaid's bucket, the torn morsels
would be protected above as well as below, when they were emptied
on the dust-heap.
<P>
Succeeding weeks and months would add to that protection, by
adding to the accumulated refuse. In the neglected condition of
the grounds, the dust-heap had not been disturbed in search of
manure. There it had stood, untouched, from the time when the
family left Gleninch to the present day. And there, hidden deep
somewhere in the mound, the fragments of the letter must be.
<P>
Such were the lawyer's conclusions. He had written immediately to
communicate them to Benjamin. And, thereupon, what had Benjamin
done?
<P>
After having tried his powers of reconstruction on his own
correspondence, the prospect of experimenting on the mysterious
letter itself had proved to be a temptation too powerful for the
old man to resist. "I almost fancy, my dear, this business of
yours has bewitched me," he wrote. "You see I have the misfortune
to be an idle man. I have time to spare and money to spare. And
the end of it is that I am here at Gleninch, engaged on my own
sole responsibility (with good Mr. Playmore's permission) in
searching the dust-heap!"
<P>
Benjamin's description of his first view of the field of action
at Gleninch followed these characteristic lines of apology.
<P>
I passed over the description without ceremony. My remembrance of
the scene was too vivid to require any prompting of that sort. I
saw again, in the dim evening light, the unsightly mound which
had so strangely attracted my attention at Gleninch. I heard
again the words in which Mr. Playmore had explained to me the
custom of the dust-heap in Scotch country-houses. What had
Benjamin and Mr. Playmore done? What had Benjamin and Mr.
Playmore found? For me, the true interest of the narrative was
there--and to that portion of it I eagerly turned next.
<P>
They had proceeded methodically, of course, with one eye on the
pounds, shillings, and pence, and the other on the object in
view. In Benjamin, the lawyer had found what he had not met with
in me--a sympathetic mind, alive to the value of "an abstract of
the expenses," and conscious of that most remunerative of human
virtues, the virtue of economy.
<P>
At so much a week, they had engaged men to dig into the mound and
to sift the ashes. At so much a week, they had hired a tent to
shelter the open dust-heap from wind and weather. At so much a
week, they had engaged the services of a young man (pers onally
known to Benjamin), who was employed in a laboratory under a
professor of chemistry, and who had distinguished himself by his
skillful manipulation of paper in a recent case of forgery on a
well-known London firm. Armed with these preparations, they had
begun the work; Benjamin and the young chemist living at
Gleninch, and taking it in turns to superintend the proceedings.
<P>
Three days of labor with the spade and the sieve produced no
results of the slightest importance. However, the matter was in
the hands of two quietly determined men. They declined to be
discouraged. They went on.
<P>
On the fourth day the first morsels of paper were found.
<P>
Upon examination, they proved to be the fragments of a
tradesman's prospectus. Nothing dismayed, Benjamin and the young
chemist still persevered. At the end of the day's work more
pieces of paper were turned up. These proved to be covered with
written characters. Mr. Playmore (arriving at Gleninch, as usual,
every evening on the conclusion of his labors in the law) was
consulted as to the handwriting. After careful examination, he
declared that the mutilated portions of sentences submitted to
him had been written, beyond all doubt, by Eustace Macallan's
first wife!
<P>
This discovery aroused the enthusiasm of the searchers to fever
height.
<P>
Spades and sieves were from that moment forbidden utensils.
However unpleasant the task might be, hands alone were used in
the further examination of the mound. The first and foremost
necessity was to place the morsels of paper (in flat cardboard
boxes prepared for the purpose) in their order as they were
found. Night came; the laborers were dismissed; Benjamin and his
two colleagues worked on by lamplight. The morsels of paper were
now turned up by dozens, instead of by ones and twos. For a while
the search prospered in this way; and then the morsels appeared
no more. Had they all been recovered? or would renewed
hand-digging yield more yet? The next light layers of rubbish
were carefully removed--and the grand discovery of the day
followed. There (upside down) was the gum-bottle which the
lodge-keeper's daughter had spoken of. And, more precious still,
there, under it, were more fragments of written paper, all stuck
together in a little lump, by the last drippings from the
gum-bottle dropping upon them as they lay on the dust-heap!
<P>
The scene now shifted to the interior of the house. When the
searchers next assembled they met at the great table in the
library at Gleninch.
<P>
Benjamin's experience with the "Puzzles" which he had put
together in the days of his boyhood proved to be of some use to
his companions. The fragments accidentally stuck together would,
in all probability, be found to fit each other, and would
certainly (in any case) be the easiest fragments to reconstruct
as a center to start from.
<P>
The delicate business of separating these pieces of paper, and of
preserving them in the order in which they had adhered to each
other, was assigned to the practiced fingers of the chemist. But
the difficulties of his task did not end here. The writing was
(as usual in letters) traced on both sides of the paper, and it
could only be preserved for the purpose of reconstruction by
splitting each morsel into two--so as artificially to make a
blank side, on which could be spread the fine cement used for
reuniting the fragments in their original form.
<P>
To Mr. Playmore and Benjamin the prospect of successfully putting
the letter together, under these disadvantages, seemed to be
almost hopeless. Their skilled colleague soon satisfied them that
they were wrong.
<P>
He drew their attention to the thickness of the paper--note-paper
of the strongest and best quality--on which the writing was
traced. It was of more than twice the substance of the last paper
on which he had operated, when he was engaged in the forgery
ease; and it was, on that account, comparatively easy for him
(aided by the mechanical appliances which he had brought from
London) to split the morsels of the torn paper, within a given
space of time which might permit them to begin the reconstruction
of the letter that night.
<P>
With these explanations, he quietly devoted himself to his work.
While Benjamin and the lawyer were still poring over the
scattered morsels of the letter which had been first discovered,
and trying to piece them together again, the chemist had divided
the greater part of the fragments specially confided to him into
two halves each; and had correctly put together some five or six
sentences of the letter on the smooth sheet of cardboard prepared
for that purpose.
<P>
They looked eagerly at the reconstructed writing so far.
<P>
It was correctly done: the sense was perfect. The first result
gained by examination was remarkable enough to reward them for
all their exertions. The language used plainly identified the
person to whom the late Mrs. Eustace had addressed her letter.
<P>
That person was--my husband.
<P>
And the letter thus addressed--if the plainest circumstantial
evidence could be trusted--was identical with the letter which
Miserrimus Dexter had suppressed until the Trial was over, and
had then destroyed by tearing it up.
<P>
These were the discoveries that had been made at the time when
Benjamin wrote to me. He had been on the point of posting his
letter, when Mr. Playmore had suggested that he should keep it by
him for a few days longer, on the chance of having more still to
tell me.
<P>
"We are indebted to her for these results," the lawyer had said.
"But for her resolution; and her influence over Miserrimus
Dexter, we should never have discovered what the dust-heap was
hiding from us--we should never have seen so much as a glimmering
of the truth. She has the first claim to the fullest information.
Let her have it."
<P>
The letter had been accordingly kept back for three days. That
interval being at an end, it was hurriedly resumed and concluded
in terms which indescribably alarmed me.
<P>
"The chemist is advancing rapidly with his part of the work"
(Benjamin wrote); "and I have succeeded in putting together a
separate portion of the torn writing which makes sense.
Comparison of what he has accomplished with what I have
accomplished has led to startling conclusions. Unless Mr.
Playmore and I are entirely wrong (and God grant we may be so!),
there is a serious necessity for your keeping the reconstruction
of the letter strictly secret from everybody about you. The
disclosures suggested by what has come to light are so
heartrending and so dreadful that I cannot bring myself to write
about them until I am absolutely obliged to do so. Please forgive
me for disturbing you with this news. We are bound, sooner or
later, to consult with you in the matter; and we think it right
to prepare your mind for what may be to come."
<P>
To this there was added a postscript in Mr. Playmore's
handwriting:
<P>
"Pray observe strictly the caution which Mr. Benjamin impresses
on you. And bear this in mind, as a warning from _me:_ If we
succeed in reconstructing the entire letter, the last person
living who ought (in my opinion) to be allowed to see it is--your
husband."
