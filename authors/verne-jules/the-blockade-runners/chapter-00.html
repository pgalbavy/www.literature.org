<H4>The Blockade Runners by Jules Verne</H4>
<P><B>[Redactor&apos;s Note:</B> <I>The Blockade Runners</I> (number <B>V008</B> in
the T&amp;M numerical listing of Verne's works) is a translation of <I>Les
forceurs de blocus</I> (1871). <I>The Blockade Runners</I>, a novella, was
included along with <I>A Floating City</I> in the first english and french
editions of this work. This translation, which follows that of Sampson and Low
(UK) and Scribners (US) is by &quot;N. D&apos;Anvers&quot;, pseudonymn for Mrs. Arthur Bell (d.
1933) who also translated other Verne books. It is also included in the fifteen
volume Parke edition of the works of Jules Verne (1911). There is another
translation by Henry Frith which was published by Routledge (1876).</P>
<P>Both of these stories are about ships; <I>Floating City</I> about the largest
ship of the time, the <I>Great Eastern</I>, and <I>Blockade Runners</I> about
one of the fastest, the <I>Dolphin</I>.</P>
