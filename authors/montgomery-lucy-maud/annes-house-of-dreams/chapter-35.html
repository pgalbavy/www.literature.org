When anne came downstairs again, the Island, as well as
all Canada, was in the throes of a campaign preceding a
general election.  Gilbert, who was an ardent
Conservative, found himself caught in the vortex, being
much in demand for speech-making at the various county
rallies.  Miss Cornelia did not approve of his mixing
up in politics and told Anne so.
<P>
"Dr. Dave never did it.  Dr. Blythe will find he is
making a mistake, believe ME.  Politics is something no
decent man should meddle with."
<P>
"Is the government of the country to be left solely to
the rogues then?" asked Anne.
<P>
"Yes--so long as it's Conservative rogues," said Miss
Cornelia, marching off with the honors of war.  "Men
and politicians are all tarred with the same brush. 
The Grits have it laid on thicker than the
Conservatives, that's all--CONSIDERABLY thicker.  But
Grit or Tory, my advice to Dr. Blythe is to steer clear
of politics.  First thing you know, he'll be running an
election himself, and going off to Ottawa for half the
year and leaving his practice to go to the dogs."
<P>
"Ah, well, let's not borrow trouble," said Anne.  "The
rate of interest is too high.  Instead, let's look at
Little Jem.  It should be spelled with a G.  Isn't he
perfectly beautiful?  Just see the dimples in his
elbows.  We'll bring him up to be a good Conservative,
you and I, Miss Cornelia."
<P>
"Bring him up to be a good man," said Miss Cornelia. 
"They're scarce and valuable; though, mind you, I
wouldn't like to see him a Grit.  As for the election,
you and I may be thankful we don't live over harbor. 
The air there is blue these days.  Every Elliott and
Crawford and MacAllister is on the warpath, loaded for
bear.  This side is peaceful and calm, seeing there's
so few men.  Captain Jim's a Grit, but it's my opinion
he's ashamed of it, for he never talks politics.  There
isn't any earthly doubt that the Conservatives will be
returned with a big majority again."
<P>
Miss Cornelia was mistaken.  On the morning after the
election Captain Jim dropped in at the little house to
tell the news.  So virulent is the microbe of party
politics, even in a peaceable old man, that Captain
Jim's cheeks were flushed and his eyes were flashing
with all his old-time fire.
<P>
"Mistress Blythe, the Liberals are in with a sweeping
majority.  After eighteen years of Tory mismanagement
this down-trodden country is going to have a chance at
last."
<P>
"I never heard you make such a bitter partisan speech
before, Captain Jim.  I didn't think you had so much
political venom in you," laughed Anne, who was not
much excited over the tidings.  Little Jem had said
"Wow-ga" that morning.  What were principalities and
powers, the rise and fall of dynasties, the overthrow
of Grit or Tory, compared with that miraculous
occurrence?
<P>
"It's been accumulating for a long while," said
Captain Jim, with a deprecating smile.  "I thought I
was only a moderate Grit, but when the news came that
we were in I found out how Gritty I really was."
<P>
"You know the doctor and I are Conservatives."
<P>
"Ah, well, it's the only bad thing I know of either of
you, Mistress Blythe.  Cornelia is a Tory, too.  I
called in on my way from the Glen to tell her the
news."
<P>
"Didn't you know you took your life in your hands?"
<P>
"Yes, but I couldn't resist the temptation."
<P>
"How did she take it?"
<P>
"Comparatively calm, Mistress Blythe, comparatively
calm.  She says, says she, `Well, Providence sends
seasons of humiliation to a country, same as to
individuals.  You Grits have been cold and hungry for
many a year.  Make haste to get warmed and fed, for you
won't be in long.'  `Well, now Cornelia,' I says,
`mebbe Providence thinks Canada needs a real long spell
of humiliation.'  Ah, Susan, have YOU heard the news? 
The Liberals are in."
<P>
Susan had just come in from the kitchen, attended by
the odor of delectable dishes which always seemed to
hover around her.
<P>
"Now, are they?" she said, with beautiful unconcern. 
"Well, I never could see but that my bread rose just as
light when Grits were in as when they were not.  And if
any party, Mrs. Doctor, dear, will make it rain before
the week is out, and save our kitchen garden from
entire ruination, that is the party Susan will vote
for.  In the meantime, will you just step out and give
me your opinion on the meat for dinner?  I am fearing
that it is very tough, and I think that we had better
change our butcher as well as our government."
<P>
One evening, a week later, Anne walked down to the
Point, to see if she could get some fresh fish from
Captain Jim, leaving Little Jem for the first time.  It
was quite a tragedy.  Suppose he cried?  Suppose Susan
did not know just exactly what to do for him?  Susan
was calm and serene.
<P>
"I have had as much experience with him as you, Mrs.
Doctor, dear, have I not?"
<P>
"Yes, with him--but not with other babies.  Why, I
looked after three pairs of twins, when I was a child,
Susan.  When they cried, I gave them peppermint or
castor oil quite coolly.  It's quite curious now to
recall how lightly I took all those babies and their
woes."
<P>
"Oh, well, if Little Jem cries, I will just clap a hot
water bag on his little stomach," said Susan.
<P>
"Not too hot, you know," said Anne anxiously.  Oh, was
it really wise to go?
<P>
"Do not you fret, Mrs. Doctor, dear.  Susan is not the
woman to burn a wee man.  Bless him, he has no notion
of crying."
<P>
Anne tore herself away finally and enjoyed her walk to
the Point after all, through the long shadows of the
sun-setting.  Captain Jim was not in the living room of
the lighthouse, but another man was--a handsome,
middle-aged man, with a strong, clean-shaven chin, who
was unknown to Anne.  Nevertheless, when she sat down,
he began to talk to her with all the assurance of an
old acquaintance.  There was nothing amiss in what he
said or the way he said it, but Anne rather resented
such a cool taking-for-granted in a complete stranger. 
Her replies were frosty, and as few as decency
required.  Nothing daunted, her companion talked on for
several minutes, then excused himself and went away. 
Anne could have sworn there was a twinkle in his eye
and it annoyed her.  Who was the creature?  There was
something vaguely familiar about him but she was
certain she had never seen him before.
<P>
"Captain Jim, who was that who just went out?" she
asked, as Captain Jim came in.
<P>
"Marshall Elliott," answered the captain.
<P>
"Marshall Elliott!" cried Anne.  "Oh, Captain Jim--it
wasn't-- yes, it WAS his voice--oh, Captain Jim, I
didn't know him--and I was quite insulting to him!  WHY
didn't he tell me?  He must have seen I didn't know
him."
<P>
"He wouldn't say a word about it--he'd just enjoy the
joke.  Don't worry over snubbing him--he'll think it
fun.  Yes, Marshall's shaved off his beard at last and
cut his hair.  His party is in, you know.  I didn't
know him myself first time I saw him.  He was up in
Carter Flagg's store at the Glen the night after
election day, along with a crowd of others, waiting for
the news.  About twelve the 'phone came through--the
Liberals were in.  Marshall just got up and walked
out--he didn't cheer or shout--he left the others to do
that, and they nearly lifted the roof off Carter's
store, I reckon.  Of course, all the Tories were over
in Raymond Russell's store.  Not much cheering THERE. 
Marshall went straight down the street to the side door
of Augustus Palmer's barber shop.  Augustus was in bed
asleep, but Marhall hammered on the door until he got
up and come down, wanting to know what all the racket
was about.
<P>
"Come into your shop and do the best job you ever did
in your life, Gus,' said Marshall.  `The Liberals are
in and you're going to barber a good Grit before the
sun rises.'
<P>
"Gus was mad as hops--partly because he'd been dragged
out of bed, but more because he's a Tory.  He vowed he
wouldn't shave any man after twelve at night.
<P>
"`You'll do what I want you to do, sonny,' said
Marshall, `or I'll jest turn you over my knee and give
you one of those spankings your mother forgot.'
<P>
"He'd have done it, too, and Gus knew it, for Marshall
is as strong as an ox and Gus is only a midget of a
man.  So he gave in and towed Marshall in to the shop
and went to work.  `Now,' says he, `I'll barber you up,
but if you say one word to me about the Grits getting
in while I'm doing it I'll cut your throat with this
razor,' says he.  You wouldn't have thought mild little
Gus could be so bloodthirsty, would you?  Shows what
party politics will do for a man.  Marshall kept quiet
and got his hair and beard disposed of and went home. 
When his old housekeeper heard him come upstairs she
peeked out of her bedroom door to see whether 'twas him
or the hired boy.  And when she saw a strange man
striding down the hall with a candle in his hand she
screamed blue murder and fainted dead away.  They had
to send for the doctor before they could bring her to,
and it was several days before she could look at
Marshall without shaking all over."
<P>
Captain Jim had no fish.  He seldom went out in his
boat that summer, and his long tramping expeditions
were over.  He spent a great deal of his time sitting
by his seaward window, looking out over the gulf, with
his swiftly-whitening head leaning on his hand.  He sat
there tonight for many silent minutes, keeping some
tryst with the past which Anne would not disturb. 
Presently he pointed to the iris of the West:
<P>
"That's beautiful, isn't, it, Mistress Blythe?  But I
wish you could have seen the sunrise this morning.  It
was a wonderful thing--wonderful.  I've seen all kinds
of sunrises come over that gulf.  I've been all over
the world, Mistress Blythe, and take it all in all,
I've never seen a finer sight than a summer sunrise
over the gulf.  A man can't pick his time for dying,
Mistress Blythe--jest got to go when the Great Captain
gives His sailing orders.  But if I could I'd go out
when the morning comes across that water.  I've watched
it many a time and thought what a thing it would be to
pass out through that great white glory to whatever was
waiting beyant, on a sea that ain't mapped out on any
airthly chart.  I think, Mistress Blythe, that I'd find
lost Margaret there."
<P>
Captain Jim had often talked to Anne of lost Margaret
since he had told her the old story.  His love for her
trembled in every tone--that love that had never grown
faint or forgetful.
<P>
"Anyway, I hope when my time comes I'll go quick and
easy.  I don't think I'm a coward, Mistress
Blythe--I've looked an ugly death in the face more than
once without blenching.  But the thought of a lingering
death does give me a queer, sick feeling of horror."
<P>
"Don't talk about leaving us, dear, DEAR Captain,
Jim," pleaded Anne, in a choked voice, patting the old
brown hand, once so strong, but now grown very feeble. 
"What would we do without you?"
<P>
Captain Jim smiled beautifully.
<P>
"Oh, you'd get along nicely--nicely--but you wouldn't
forget the old man altogether, Mistress Blythe--no, I
don't think you'll ever quite forget him.  The race of
Joseph always remembers one another.  But it'll be a
memory that won't hurt--I like to think that my memory
won't hurt my friends--it'll always be kind of pleasant
to them, I hope and believe.  It won't be very long now
before lost Margaret calls me, for the last time.  I'll
be all ready to answer.  I jest spoke of this because
there's a little favor I want to ask you.  Here's this
poor old Matey of mine"--Captain Jim reached out a
hand and poked the big, warm, velvety, golden ball on
the sofa.  The First Mate uncoiled himself like a
spring with a nice, throaty, comfortable sound, half
purr, half meow, stretched his paws in air, turned over
and coiled himself up again.  "HE'll miss me when I
start on the V'yage.  I can't bear to think of leaving
the poor critter to starve, like he was left before. 
If anything happens to me will you give Matey a bite
and a corner, Mistress Blythe?"
<P>
"Indeed I will."
<P>
"Then that is all I had on my mind.  Your Little Jem is
to have the few curious things I picked up--I've seen
to that.  And now I don't like to see tears in those
pretty eyes, Mistress Blythe.  I'll mebbe hang on for
quite a spell yet.  I heard you reading a piece of
poetry one day last winter--one of Tennyson's pieces. 
I'd sorter like to hear it again, if you could recite
it for me."
<P>
Softly and clearly, while the seawind blew in on them,
Anne repeated the beautiful lines of Tennyson's
wonderful swan song-- "Crossing the Bar."  The old
captain kept time gently with his sinewy hand.
<P>
"Yes, yes, Mistress Blythe," he said, when she had
finished, "that's it, that's it.  He wasn't a sailor,
you tell me--I dunno how he could have put an old
sailor's feelings into words like that, if he wasn't
one.  He didn't want any `sadness o' farewells' and
neither do I, Mistress Blythe--for all will be well
with me and mine beyant the bar."
