<p>  You'll find this true where'er you go   That those prepared
few troubles know.</p>

<p>"To begin with, I am not such a very big fellow, am I?" said
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Ah reckons Ah knows a right smart lot of folks bigger than yo',
Brer Skunk," replied Unc' Billy, with a grin. You know Jimmy Skunk
really is a little fellow compared with some of his neighbors.</p>

<p>"And I haven't very long claws or very big teeth, have I?" continued
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Ah reckons mine are about as long and about as big," returned
Unc' Billy, looking more puzzled than ever.</p>

<p>"But you never see anybody bothering me, do you?" went on Jimmy.</p>

<p>"No," replied Unc' Billy.</p>

<p>"And it's the same way with Prickly Porky the Porcupine. You
never see anybody bothering him or offering to do him any harm,
do you?" persisted Jimmy.</p>

<p>"No," replied Unc' Billy once more.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Jimmy.</p>

<p>Unc' Billy grinned broadly. "Ah reckons, Brer Skunk," said he,
"that there isn't anybody wants to go fo' to meddle with yo' and
Brer Porky. Ah reckons most folks knows what would happen if they
did, and that yo' and Brer Porky are folks it's a sight mo' comfortable
to leave alone. Leastways, Ah does. Ah ain't aiming fo' trouble
with either of yo'. That li'l bag of scent yo' carry is cert'nly
most powerful, Brer Skunk, and Ah isn't hankering to brush against
those little spears Brer Porky is so free with. Ah knows when
Ah's well off, and Ah reckons most folks feel the same way."</p>

<p>Jimmy Skunk chuckled. "One more question, Unc' Billy," said he.
"Did you ever know me to pick a quarrel and use that bag of scent
without being attacked?"</p>

<p>Unc' Billy considered for a few minutes. "Ah can't say Ah ever
did," he replied.</p>

<p>"And you never knew Prickly Porky to go hunting trouble either,"
declared Jimmy. "We don't either of us go hunting trouble, and
trouble never comes hunting us, and the reason is that we both
are always prepared for trouble and everybody knows it. Buster
Bear could squash me by just stepping on me, but he doesn't try
it. You notice he always is very polite when we meet. Prickly
Porky and I are armed for <em>defence</em>, but we never use our
weapons for <em>offence</em>. Nobody bothers us, and we bother
nobody. That's the beauty of being prepared."</p>

<p>Unc' Billy thought it over for a few minutes. Then he sighed
and sighed again.</p>

<p>"Ah reckons yo' and Brer Porky are about the luckiest people
Ah knows," said he. "Yes, Sah, Ah reckons yo' is just that. Ah
don't fear anybody mah own size, but Ah cert'nly does have some
mighty scary times when Ah meets some people Ah might mention.
Ah wish Ol' Mother Nature had done gone and given me something
fo' to make people as scary of me as they are of yo'. Ah cert'nly
believes in preparedness after seein' yo', Brer Skunk. Ah cert'nly
does just that very thing. Have yo' found any nice fresh aiggs
lately?"</p>
