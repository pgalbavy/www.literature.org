<p>THAT was a fine idea of General Antenna's--that plan of bringing
stepladders, so that the ant army might climb up on them and reach Daddy
Longlegs, whom they were attacking.
</p>
<p>And Captain Kidd told the General on the spot that it was a most happy
thought.
</p><p>"Then do as I tell you, at once!" the General ordered pompously.
</p><p>"I can't!" said Captain Kidd, who was terribly frightened, because the
General was sure to be angry.
</p><p>"_Can't!<u>" cried General Antenna fiercely. "</u>Can't!_ What do you mean,
madam?" (Perhaps you did not know that Captain Kidd was a lady, as were
also the General and the whole army, too!)
</p><p>Captain Kidd's voice broke as she stammered an answer to General
Antenna's rude demand.
</p><p>"I know of only one stepladder in Pleasant Valley," she explained. "It
belongs to Farmer Green. And it's so heavy that the whole army couldn't
move it."
</p><p>At that a shudder passed over General Antenna's fat body.
</p><p>"Then we're as good as lost!" she shrieked. "Daddy Longlegs will defeat
us. And I'll never hear the last of it."
</p><p>And right there on the edge of the battle-field General Antenna shed so
many bitter tears that Captain Kidd had to move aside slightly, to keep
her feet from getting wet.
</p><p>"Don't weep!" cried the Captain in a husky voice. "It's not your
fault--really!"
</p><p>"Whose is it, then?" asked the General brokenly.
</p><p>"Why, Farmer Green is to blame, of course!" Captain Kidd replied. "If he
hadn't made his stepladder so big we might have used it and won the
battle just as easily as not."
</p><p>"That's so!" the General agreed, drying her tears on a lace
handkerchief. "And from this time forth, Farmer Green and I are deadly
enemies!"
</p><p>Meanwhile the battle still raged furiously. But Daddy Longlegs had not
received a single wound. And perceiving, at last, that he was quite
unharmed, he took heart again.
</p><p>Finally it occurred to him that the ant army was totally unable to reach
him, borne high in the air as he was by his long legs. And as his fear
left him, he could think of no reason why he should stay where he was
any longer.
</p><p>Accordingly he pulled himself together and began to walk away. He moved
right through the ant army; and the soldiers were powerless to stop him.
</p><p>Just then General Antenna happened to glance over the battle-field. And
her sad look at once gave way to one of great joy. She even gave Captain
Kidd a hearty slap on the back--much to that lady's distress (because it
knocked her cap awry).
</p><p>"Look!" cried the General. "We've won the battle after all; for the
enemy is retreating! Daddy Longlegs is running away!"
</p><p>Hurrying off then, General Antenna joined her army, and told her
soldiers that they had shown themselves to be very brave, and that as a
reward they might each have an extra drink of milk that night with their
supper.
</p><p>There was great rejoicing in the ant colony that evening. And General
Antenna caused the news of the victory to be carried throughout Pleasant
Valley.
</p><p>But when he heard it, after he reached home, Daddy Longlegs laughed
merrily.
</p><p>"Why, they never touched me!" he exclaimed.
