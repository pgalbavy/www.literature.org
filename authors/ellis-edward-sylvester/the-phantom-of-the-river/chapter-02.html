<p>Three separate times previous to this that faint cawing signal
had been heard, as it seemed, from the distant tree-tops. The
most sensitive ear could not say of a certainty it was not made
by one of those black-coated birds calling to its mate or the
flock from which it had strayed. Neither Boone nor Kenton distinguished
any difference between the tone and what they had heard times
without number, and yet neither held a doubt that it was emitted
by a dusky spy stealing through the woods, and that it bore a
momentous message to others of his kith and kin.</p>

<p>The keen sense of hearing enabled the rangers to locate the signal
at less than a quarter of a mile in front and quite close to the
Ohio. From the first time it was heard, no more than half an hour
before, it held the same relative distance from the river, but
advanced at a pace so nearly equal to that of Boone and Kenton
that it was impossible to decide whether it was further off or
nearer than before.</p>

<p>There was no reply to the call, and it was uttered only three
times in each instance. The oppressive stillness that held reign
throughout the forest on that sultry summer afternoon enabled
the two men to hear the cawing with unmistakable distinctness.</p>

<p>In short, our friends interpreted it as a notice from the dusky
scout to his comrades that he was following the progress of the
pioneers, which was therefore fully understood by the war party
that was seeking to encompass their destruction.</p>

<p>When the signal sounded for the fourth time, the rangers seated
on the fallen tree looked in each other's faces without speaking.
Then Kenton asked, in his guarded undertone:</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Dan'l?"</p>

<p>"There's only one thing to make of it; them Shawanoes are keeping
track of every movement of the folks behind us, and we can't hinder'
em."</p>

<p>"How many of the varmints are playing the spy?"</p>

<p>"There may be one, and there may be a dozen."</p>

<p>This answer, of necessity, was guess-work, for there was no possible
means of determining the number, since the hostiles in front so
regulated their progress that not a glimpse had been caught of
the almost invisible trail left by them.</p>

<p>And yet the matter was not wholly conjecture, after all.</p>

<p>"Dan'l," said Kenton, with a significant smile, "there's more
than one of 'em, and you and me know it."</p>

<p>The older smiled in turn and nodded his head.</p>

<p>"You're right; there's two, and may be more&mdash;but we know there's
two."</p>

<p>Nothing could show more strikingly the marvelous woodcraft of
these remarkable men than their agreement in this declaration,
which was founded upon this fact.</p>

<p>There was a shade of difference between the tone of the last
signal and those that preceded it. You and I would have shaken
our heads and smiled, had we been asked to distinguish it, but
to those two past masters in woodcraft it was as absolute as between
the notes of a flute and the throbbing of a drum.</p>

<p>It was as if, after a Shawanoe had cawed three times, he permitted
a companion to try his hand, or rather his throat, at it, and
he who made the attempt acquitted himself right well.</p>

<p>"Now, Simon," remarked the elder, "as I make it, it's this way&mdash;they
mean to ambush the party at Rattlesnake Gulch."</p>

<p>"You're right! that's it," remarked Kenton, with an approving
nod of his head, "and if we don't sarcumvent 'em the varmints
will have every scalp, including ours."</p>

<p>"Rattlesnake Gulch" was a name given to a deep depression on
the Kentucky side of the river, and within one hundred yards of
the stream. It was less than a half a mile in advance of where
the two rangers were seated on the fallen tree, as the summer
day was drawing to a close.</p>

<p>A trail made by buffaloes, deer, and other wild animals led through
the middle of this densely-wooded section. No doubt this path
had been in existence at least one hundred years. Beyond the gulch
it trended to the right and deeper into the woods, terminating
at a noted salt lick, always a favorite resort of quadrupeds whether
wild or domestic.</p>

<p>The forest was so deep and matted with undergrowth, both to the
right and left of this depression, that nothing but the most pressing
necessity could prevent a person from using the trail when journeying
to the eastward or westward through that section. Evidently, the
Shawanoes counted upon the settlers following the path, and such
they would assuredly do unless prevented by the advance scouts.</p>

<p>"Captain Bushwick was out on a little scout himself last summer,"
remarked Kenton, who, despite their alarming surroundings, seemed
to be in somewhat of a reminiscent mood, "when, on his way back,
he started through that holler. The fust thing he did was to step
into a rattler, which burried his fangs in his leggins, just missing
his skin. Afore the sarpent could strike again, the captain made
a sweep with his gun bar'l that knocked off his head. He was a
whopper, and the captain pulled out his knife to cut off his rattles
to bring to the block-house, when he catched the whir of another
rattler just behind him, and if he hadn't jumped powerful lively
he would have catched it that time sartin. Howsumever, the sarpint
couldn't reach him, and the captain shot the mate, and brought
the music box of each home with him."</p>

<p>"It was Captain Bushwick who gave the name Rattlesnake Gulch
to the place, I 'spose," was the inquiring remark of Boone.</p>

<p>"Yes, he seemed to think that name was not only purty, but desarving,
though I've been through the holler a good many times and never
seed a sarpent."</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"When was that?"</p>

<p>"Less than two weeks ago, I was just entering from the other
side when I caught sight of a buck that was on his way to the
lick. He would have seed me if he hadn't seed just then something
else in the path in front of him that interested him more. It
was a rattler as big as them of the captain's. The buck was a
fool, for instead of backing out, as you know animals are quick
to do at sight of a rattler, he began to snuff and cavort about
the snake, and finally brought his front hoofs down on it. Of
course, he cut the serpent all to ribbons, but afore he done it
the buck was stung once or twice, and inside of half an hour he
jined the rattler he had sent on afore. Rattlers are as bad as
Injins!" muttered Boone, with an expression of disgust.</p>

<p>"They may be in some partic'lars, but in some they ain't, Dan'l;
f'r instance, they don't caw like a crow, and don't try to ambuscade
folks, and they give you warning afore they strike, which is more
than the two-legged varmints do."</p>

<p>"Talk about the rattler giving warning afore he strikes," repeated
Boone, who had a poor opinion of the genus crotalus, "he'd be
a much more decent sarpint if he didn't strike at all. The black
snake doesn't sting you, and yet he'll kill the rattler every
time. Howsumever," added the elder ranger, "what's snakes got
to do with the bus'ness afore us?"</p>

<p>"That's what I was thinking. Now, Dan'l, we've got to make the
varmints think we're going to try to pass through Rattlesnake
Gulch to-night, so they'll all gather there to welcome us."</p>

<p>"And then what will our folks do?"</p>

<p>"Take some other route."</p>

<p>"But which one? The woods are so thick on the right and left
that they, especially the women, can't go ten feet without making
a noise that'll be sartin to be heard by the varmints."</p>

<p>"There are several things they can do," replied Kenton, thoughtfully,
proving that, like his companion, he had speculated much on the
matter. "In the first place, they must move so slow that they
won't reach the neighborhood of the gulch till after dark, and
yet if they move too slow the Shawanoes will be suspicious. I
wish night was near at hand."</p>

<p>"What good does wishing do?"</p>

<p>"None, and never did; but when night does come we can turn about&mdash;that
is, some of the boys can, with the women&mdash;and cross the river
further down stream, strike the trail on the other side of the
Ohio, and go straight to the block-house."</p>

<p>Boone shook his head. The scheme did not impress him favorably.</p>

<p>"How are you going to get them women and two children across
the river? It isn't likely that any one of 'em knows how to swim
a stroke."</p>

<p>"What trouble would it be to tote 'em over?"</p>

<p>Boone again shook his head; he was not pleased with the suggestion.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to do anything of the kind, but," added Kenton,
more seriously, "there's a canoe of mine hid under the bushes
just this side of the gulch, purvided the varmints haven't tumbled
over it."</p>

<p>"More'n likely they've took it away or smashed it, but if I ain't
mistook, there's a craft alongside the flatboat that you left
at the clearing."</p>

<p>"You are right."</p>

<p>"Why not go back for that?"</p>

<p>"It ain't a bad idee," remarked Kenton, thoughtfully. "If I can
manage to fetch the boat up the river without any of the varmints
'specting it, it'll be just the thing."</p>

<p>"It won't carry all the women and children and rest of the folks
at once."</p>

<p>"Then we can make two v'yages or more, if it's necessary."</p>

<p>"It's risky bus'ness, but it's the best thing that can be done.
If you are lucky 'nough to find tother boat where you left it,
seems to me things will look up."</p>

<p>Kenton glanced around among the tree-tops, as if searching for
something. So he was, though not for any special object.</p>

<p>"'Cording to the way things look it'll be a good two hours afore
it'll be dark 'nough to set to work to sarcumvent the varmints.
Them two hours are long 'nough for the folks to make the trip
to Rattlesnake Gulch twice over. Some plan has got to be fixed
up not to git thar till after two hours is gone, and yet not to
have the Shawanoes 'spect that we 'spect anything. Can you tell
me how the thing is to be done, Dan'l?"</p>

<p>"There ought to be a good many ways," replied the elder, after
a brief pause; "some accident might happen, such, f'r 'nstance,
as getting bit by a rattler."</p>

<p>Kenton saw the twinkle in the eyes of his friend, who spoke with
the utmost gravity. "Remember," said the younger, "I never seed
any rattler near the gulch; you have; you're the one, therefore,
to see some of 'em agin. You're the one to let a big rattler sting
you. After he's made sartin he's done his work well, why I'll
happen 'long and smash the rattler, and then look after you&mdash;helloa!"</p>

<p>Both instinctively grasped their rifles, for they heard the rustling
of leaves, which showed that some one was approaching. Had the
noise been less pronounced the two rangers would have darted behind
the nearest sheltering trees; but the noise was too distinct for
either Boone or Kenton to suspect that an enemy was at hand. They
knew it was a friend&mdash;at least one from whom they had nothing
to fear.</p>

<p>So it proved; for while they were peering toward the point whence
the figure was known to be approaching, Jethro Juggens, the burly
colored servant lad of Mr. Altman, slouched into sight, with his
rifle slung over his shoulder. Not until he had advanced a dozen
steps further did he see two hunters seated on the fallen tree.
Then he stopped suddenly, with a startled expression, and brought
his heavy rifle to the front.</p>

<p>"None of that!" called Kenton, uncertain what the fellow might
do.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Kenton, dat's yo'self, am it?" called Jethro, with
a grin; "I tinked you was de Panther. I was jes' gwine to plug
yo'; lucky yo' spoke when yo' done did, or I'd wiped out bofe
ob yo' afore anybody could hold me; but," added Jethro, in an
awed undertone, "I's got bery important news for yo', Mr. Kenton
and Mr. Boom."</p>
