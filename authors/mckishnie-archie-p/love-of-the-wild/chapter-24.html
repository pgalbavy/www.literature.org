<p>The men plunged through the timber toward the settlement. The ground was
soft with snow now and the darkness was so dense that only their
unerring sense of directions made progress at all possible.
</p>
<p>“Bill,” panted Boy, “it’s likely Hallibut and his gang.”
</p><p>“Likely. But they’ll reckon with us now,” fumed Paisley; “that is, if
we’re not too late,” he added in his throat.
</p><p>A rifle shot rang out on the night and the men quickened their pace.
</p><p>“That’s at our place, all right,” groaned Boy.
</p><p>Paisley did not reply. In his heart was a great fear that they would be
too late to lend succor to the man and helpless women in the McTavish
home. At their fastest they could but make slow progress through the
thick timber, and several times were they brought up short and
breathless by coming in violent contact with trees. It was an agonizing
half-hour to both, this frenzied rush through a forest in pitch
darkness. When the timber grew sparser and the footing better they
bounded on, crashing through thick second-growth groves and leaping
white patches of open, their goal the log-house where danger menaced
loved ones. As they emerged into the wide clearing the clouds above them
parted and the starlight showed a number of forms creeping toward the
cover of the wood.
</p><p>“Come,” whispered Boy. But Paisley, sinking on one knee behind him,
leveled his long rifle.
</p><p>“May this bullet go true to the leader of the dogs,” he muttered.
</p><p>Then slowly the rifle was lowered, and Paisley arose.
</p><p>“No, I can’t shoot until I am sure,” he said, “—but if they’ve harmed
little Gloss——”
</p><p>He hurried forward. At the edge of the garden-patch his foot came into
contact with a yielding body. The clouds had covered the stars again,
but Paisley with a low word of distress bent and lifted Joe, the Irish
setter, in his arms. The dog was dead. His head sagged over against the
man’s shoulder, as tenderly Paisley carried him forward and laid him
just outside the door.
</p><p>“It’s Bill,” he called, and the door was opened. On a chair beside the
window lay two rifles and in one corner of the room knelt Big McTavish,
his wife, and Granny, beside the still form of a girl lying in Boy’s
arms. The big man looked up at Paisley appealingly, and the tears
streamed down his seamed face as he said brokenly:
</p><p>“They tried to steal our little Gloss, Bill, and she’s fainted from
fright.”
</p><p>Paisley, his temples throbbing and his soul sick, came forward and,
bending, looked into the white face of the girl. Her eyes were closed
and her bosom rose and fell. Her arms were about Boy’s neck and her lips
moved in meaningless words. Bill sank on a stool and took one of the
girl’s limp hands in his own.
</p><p>“Missus,” he said, addressing Mrs. McTavish, “we’ll find out who it was
tried to do this thing. Will you take care of little Gloss, marm?—I
want to talk things over with Mac and Boy.”
</p><p>“Let me take her, Boy,” said Mrs. McTavish. “Gloss, dear, do you feel
better now?”
</p><p>Gradually the great eyes opened and a smile fluttered on the girl’s
lips.
</p><p>“I’m all right now,” she answered weakly, “only those rough men
frightened me so much I feel like bein’ babied, auntie. Take me like you
used to when I was a little girl and hold me tight. It seems I want you
so much—so much——”
</p><p>She broke off and her arms tightened about Boy’s neck. Then quickly they
unclasped and she arose, staggering, a flush wiping the pallor from her
face.
</p><p>“I guess I wasn’t just myself, Boy,” she stammered.
</p><p>And leaning on the older woman’s arm she passed slowly from the room.
</p><p>Big McTavish, who was replacing his rifle in the rack, turned.
</p><p>“Will they come back, d’ye think?” he asked.
</p><p>“Most likely,” Paisley answered; “but not again to-night, though.
They’re some anxious to live, I suppose. Now,” he cried sharply, “why
were they here, and what do they mean by tryin’ to break into your house
and kidnap little Gloss?”
</p><p>Big Mac shook his head.
</p><p>“I was playin’ the fiddle here by the fire, and Gloss, ma, and Granny
was busy in there with the spinnin’ when Davie opened the window there
behind you and dropped in. I could see he was awful excited, so I called
Gloss out. She can understand his language better’n I can, and when she
told me what Davie had seen I scarcely knowed what to do. When I was
gettin’ down the guns and Gloss was lockin’ the door Davie crawled
outside again. I wouldn’t have let him go, but he slipped away. I heard
’em shoot, but I’m prayin’ God they didn’t hit the lad.”
</p><p>“Davie’s all right,” cried Paisley. “He came for me and Boy. What next?”
</p><p>“I’m awful glad he wasn’t hit,” said the big man. “Well, about ten
minutes before I heard the shot, old Joe, who’d been tuggin’ at his
leash, broke loose, and I heard him mixin’ things with ’em outside. I
heard somebody yellin’ that the dog was killin’ him. Then the shot was
fired and——”
</p><p>Paisley turned quickly and looked at Boy. His head was bowed upon his
breast and his hands were clenched.
</p><p>“And,” continued McTavish, “I didn’t hear poor old Joe after that.”
</p><p>“Poor old Joe,” said Boy; “poor old pup.”
</p><p>Then, lifting his head, he looked out of the window at the
silver-crested sky-clouds with smarting eyes.
</p><p>“He always liked these dark, quiet nights,” he said, as if to himself,
“and when the starlight slipped through like it’s doin’ now, no matter
if it was only early or midnight, he would get up and wag his tail just
out o’ happiness—pure happiness. And now he’s dead, and they killed
him—damn ’em.”
</p><p>“I found him just in the edge of the garden,” said Paisley. “Yes, Boy,
poor old Joe is dead, and he died fightin’ for you; he sure died
fightin’ for you.”
</p><p>Boy nodded and looked at his father.
</p><p>“Go on, dad, let’s hear the rest of it.”
</p><p>“After that they came up and pounded on the door. They demanded that I
let ’em in. ‘What do you want?’ I asked. ‘You’ll find that out soon
enough,’ they answered. ‘You’re all alone and there’s four of us,’ they
said. ‘If you don’t open the door we’ll break it down.’”
</p><p>Big McTavish paused, a catch in his voice.
</p><p>“I reckon the old devil has a purty good mortgage on my soul yet,” he
went on, his voice husky. “I know there’d have been killin’ done right
then if it hadn’t been for ma and Gloss and Granny. They wouldn’t let me
shoot. They begged for me not to shoot. I heard some of the gang say:
‘We’ve got to get that girl, boys.’ I scarcely knowed what they
meant—not then. There was a pot o’ boilin’ pitch on the crane there
that I was gettin’ ready for boat calkin’, and just as they banged the
door open I hurled that pitch plumb into them. I reckon it found ’em all
right, ’cause they scampered back purty quick, and when I peaked through
the crack I could see them runnin’ for the timber. ‘Back everybody,
there’s somebody comin’,’ I heard someone shout. That’s all I know now.
But I wish I knowed why they wanted to steal little Gloss.”
</p><p>“I reckon we’re goin’ to know why right soon,” mumbled Paisley.
</p><p>He stood by the open door and the cold night was aglow with big early
winter stars hanging above the tree-fringe. In their light, beside his
old resting-place, the ash-gum, lay old Joe. An owl hooted from a nearby
thicket and the chickens in the coop stirred and voiced their alarm in
shrill peepings and squawks. But old Joe did not awaken and turn three
times around. No more would he arise in the golden or silvery night and
stretch and yawn his thanks for life to the deep skies.
</p><p>Suddenly, bayward, a streak of crimson darted aloft and licked the
heavens. Paisley started, and pointed toward it. Boy and his father
followed Bill’s gaze.
</p><p>“It’s Hallibut’s schooner,” exclaimed Boy; “she’s on fire.”
</p><p>As they watched, a sheet of orange-yellow flame drifted up and the
pointed tree-tops of the forest stood out, a broad expanse of fiery
spikes, fluctuating and drifting between earth and heaven. In silence
they watched the wild lights until they crept down from the skies and
the owl’s low hoot sounded again from the shadow. Then the men looked at
one another.
</p><p>“Surely hell is awake this night,” said Paisley, wiping his face on his
buckskin, sleeve. “Thank God it’ll soon be daylight.”
</p><p>Boy picked up his rifle.
</p><p>“I’m goin’ to look for Davie,” he said.
</p><p>“In a little while, Boy, in a little while,” soothed Paisley. “It’ll be
light then, and you can see. No use to go yet, lad. See, it’s comin’
dawn now, and it’ll be safer for you then.”
</p><p>“Aye, lad,” spoke McTavish firmly, “we must make no false moves now. The
fight’s on and our new law must be lived up to. If we sin in killin’
them who wish to kill us, why, sin we must. The only brother I had in
the world was massacred because he found killin’ a red snake hard. We’ll
show no mercy to devils that would try to steal our little girl.”
</p><p>Boy had drawn the dead dog into the room and was stroking its long red
hair with his hand.
</p><p>“It’s not in reason to think Hallibut ’ud get in his work here and turn
back and set fire to his own schooner,” said Paisley. “He’s done it,
though, to make a case against us. We can’t deny sayin’ that we’d stand
up for our own. They thought if they could get hold of Gloss that we’d
give up the deeds to our properties to get her back.”
</p><p>“Who was in the gang?” asked Boy.
</p><p>“I only saw two of them when I opened the door,” replied McTavish. “I
saw the agent Watson, and I saw Simpson the teacher—he was with ’em.”
</p><p>He broke off, his jaw dropping. Boy sprang to his feet, his face
twitching in a fury of hate. His strong teeth had bitten blood from his
tightened lips. He gazed across toward the approaching dawn to where the
scar of civilization lay upon the Wild. The two older men glanced at
each other and the father shook his head. The question asked in
Paisley’s glance was beyond all answering from him.
</p><p>Not until the red sun had cut a disk in the misty eastern skies did Boy
turn and sit down weakly on a stool. Then Paisley was the first to break
the gloomy silence.
</p><p>“Boy,” he said, putting his hands on the shoulders of that drooping
form, “me’n you have been through close shaves together; have chopped
logs again the two next best choppers in Bushwhackers’ Place; have
hunted and fished together. And I reckon we’re pals now if we’re ever
goin’ to be. It’s ’cause I’ve been through purty much the same thing as
you’re goin’ through now that I want to speak a word. You’ve made up
your mind to get even with the teacher. Boy, don’t you do it—not until
you’re sure o’ what you may only fancy now. Why, you’d about finish him
if you ever got started. Let me help you untangle this riddle, and let
me give Simpson his deserts like a good old pal ought to do.”
</p><p>Boy shook his head.
</p><p>“Bill,” he said in hard, even tones, “you’ve a mighty big claim on me. I
know that better’n you do. You know that I’d follow any advice of yours
in reason, same’s I’ve always done. I’ll promise to do this much. I’ll
let you find for sure that he was with the gang before I do it; but it’s
got to be done by me, Bill.”
</p><p>He wrung Paisley’s hand, smiling bravely, then passed into the next
room.
</p><p>Paisley felt in his pocket and brought forth a smoke-grimed pipe. He
twisted off a piece of Canada-Green tobacco the size of a walnut,
crammed it into the spacious bowl, and, applying a coal from the fire,
smoked as though his life depended upon his filling the room with blue
smoke in a specified time. Next, he turned to Big McTavish, who sat bent
before the fire.
</p><p>“It’s funny, ain’t it?” he whispered, nodding toward the other room.
</p><p>McTavish drew himself up slowly.
</p><p>“What’s funny, Bill?”
</p><p>Paisley carried his stool over close to that of the father. His face was
working and the blue clouds of raw tobacco-smoke floated from his lips
in mountains. He placed the stool down and, sitting on it, peered into
the older man’s troubled face.
</p><p>“Mac,” he said gently, “there ain’t the likes of that boy of yours
anywhere on this continent. He’s got a heart that’s open to everythin’
that needs sympathy, and he’s got a heart that’s hell when it gets sot
on a thing. It’s sot on Gloss, and I reckon no earthly power is goin’ to
keep them two from makin’ a clean job of it. But, Mac, Boy’s heart don’t
stop there, by a long ways. It’s got a hatin’ side to it, and a regular
Injun-hatin’ side it is, too. I’d naturally want to know that I had a
clean slate with the white punter before I tried interferin’ with
anythin’ Boy called his.” Paisley jerked his head sideways. “And I
reckon Gloss is his, ’cause they are just made for each other. Well,
now, this teacher chap he seems to think different—or else why should
he be interested in havin’ Gloss kidnapped away? He’s just about let
himself commit suicide with his conceit. He’s a bad one, and maybe
deserves all he’d get; but you and me mus’n’t let Boy at him. Now, it’s
for you to save Boy from himself. I’m goin’ over and have it out with
Simpson now, and then I’m goin’ to warn him what he’s in for if he keeps
on hangin’ around these parts. Boy’ll never forgive me for warnin’ him,
but I can’t help that. I’m goin’ now,” he concluded, rising, “and you
see that you don’t let Boy out of your sight till I’m back.”
</p><p>Paisley reached for his cap and gun and stole from the house. It had
frozen during the night, and an open slash across the face of the creek
showed where a skiff had crossed not many hours before. Reaching the
clump of willows where his own canoe lay hidden, Paisley pulled it forth
and crossed the creek, breaking the thin ice with his paddle. At Ross’s
landing he found a three-seated skiff. There were two empty bottles on
its bottom and a crumpled handkerchief beneath one of the seats. Paisley
picked up the handkerchief. It was of linen and of a kind not used by
the people of the bush. He put it in his pocket and walked slowly toward
widow Ross’s home. On the threshold he was met by Mary Ann. There were
dark shadows beneath her eyes and her lips trembled when she spoke his
name.
</p><p>“Bill Paisley,” she whispered, and, closing the door behind her, she
motioned him into the open lean-to. “Hallibut’s boat was burned last
night. I suppose you know it?”
</p><p>“Yes, I know it, Mary Ann,” he answered.
</p><p>“Did you see Mr. Simpson last night, Bill?” she asked.
</p><p>“No.”
</p><p>“Well, he went deer-shootin’ by starlight with some men from Bridgetown,
and he was hurt in some way. I heard them come back here three hours
ago, and they were talkin’ about it. They had a couple of extra horses
with them. They took him away with them.”
</p><p>“A couple of extra horses?” mused Bill. Aloud he asked:
</p><p>“Is he comin’ back here any more, Mary Ann?”
</p><p>“I don’t know,” she replied. “I hope not.”
</p><p>“You hope not?” he said quickly. “Are you sure? They do say you and him
are——”
</p><p>“I can’t help what they say,” she said wearily. “I’m glad he’s gone,
Bill.”
</p><p>Paisley stood his rifle against a tree. His face was aglow with hope.
</p><p>“Mary Ann,” he said gently, “you’ve known me a long time, and you know
just why I ask this question. Has he been square with you?”
</p><p>She gazed at him in wonderment.
</p><p>“Square with me?” she exclaimed, and laughed. “Well, you better believe
he has been.”
</p><p>Paisley caught the girl’s hands and held them tight.
</p><p>“And didn’t you care for him a lot?” he asked huskily.
</p><p>“No,” she answered, her face averted, “I didn’t care for him at all. He
wasn’t my style, Bill.”
</p><p>“Mary Ann,” said the Bushwhacker, “so long’s I thought you liked Simpson
better’n me I kept away. Now, if I could learn somehow that you cared
more for me than you do for anybody else, ‘give my life,’ as Mrs.
Declute says, if I wouldn’t ask you right out to be Mrs. Paisley. I’ve
got a nice home all to myself and three old socks crammed with
greenbacks made out of pelts, hid away again’ a weddin’-day with you.
You see, Mary Ann,” he said wistfully, “I somehow knowed, or thought I
knowed, you didn’t mean right down business with the teacher. Now, girl,
am I to be your old man or am I not?”
</p><p>“You are, Bill,” she whispered, hiding her face on his shoulder.
</p><p>Widow Ross, coming out hurriedly from the house with a steaming pot of
potatoes in her hand, saw something that almost made her drop her
burden. There stood long Bill Paisley with his arms about her Mary Ann’s
waist.
</p><p>“Bill Paisley,” gasped the widow, advancing, “you get right away from
Mary Ann. Ain’t you ashamed of yourself! You’re old enough to know
better. Now, you get right away from my girl or I’ll scald you with this
hot potater water.”
</p><p>“She ain’t your girl no more, widder,” grinned Paisley. “She’s mine
now.”
</p><p>“Mary Ann,” commanded her mother sternly, “answer me—be you?”
</p><p>“Yes, ma,” answered Mary Ann, and she snuggled down again.
</p><p>“Well,” flared the widow, “if it’s so, it’s so. Bill Paisley,” she
cried, “you get off my property and don’t you come back here no more.
You kin steal a poor widder’s only daughter,” she sobbed, dropping the
kettle and covering her face with her apron, “but you can’t come here
and do it. You’d better get off my place.”
</p><p>Paisley patted the girl’s hair and picked up his rifle.
</p><p>“I’m sorry you take it that way, widder,” he stammered. “I hate to go,
and now I smell that bacon you’ve been cookin’ I just naturally hate to
go more’n ever. I always said that widder Ross could fry bacon like no
other woman this side of the creek——”
</p><p>“Me’n Mary Ann be the only women on this side,” snorted the widow,
dropping her apron.
</p><p>“I mean anywhere in Bushwhackers’ Place, marm,” bowed Bill. “I always
remember them pies you made for Mac’s loggin’-bee, and the puddin’ for
Declute’s, too.”
</p><p>“I suppose there’s no hurry for your goin’,” sighed Mrs. Boss, “and I’ll
own I did cook more’n enough meat this mornin’; for why, I don’t know.
So if you want to, you kin come in and eat breakfast. But,” she added,
“you’ll sure have to get off my property after you’ve et.”
</p><p>The good lady picked up her kettle and whisked into the house. Paisley
smiled at Mary Ann.
</p><p>“You always have such a way of gettin’ round ma,” laughed the girl.
</p><p>“Mary Ann, you’ve got a proper good ma,” said Bill earnestly.
</p><p>As they entered the house young Tom came running up the path.
</p><p>“Isn’t it awful?” he cried. “They think poor old Noah was burnt with the
schooner. They found his skiff floatin’ near the middle grounds.”
