<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>We battled to a corner, where a jut of building stood out into
the street. It was our only chance to protect our backs, to stand
up with the rib of stone between us. It was only the work of seconds.
One instant we were groping our solitary way in the darkness,
the next we were pinned against a wall with a throaty mob surging
round us.</p>

<p>It took me a moment or two to realize that we were attacked.
Every man has one special funk in the back of his head, and mine
was to be the quarry of an angry crowd. I hated the thought of
it—the mess, the blind struggle, the sense of unleashed passions
different from those of any single blackguard. It was a dark world
to me, and I don’t like darkness. But in my nightmares I had never
imagined anything just like this. The narrow, fetid street, with
the icy winds fanning the filth, the unknown tongue, the hoarse
savage murmur, and my utter ignorance as to what it might all
be about, made me cold in the pit of my stomach.</p>

<p>"We’ve got it in the neck this time, old man," I said to Peter,
who had out the pistol the commandant at Rustchuk had given him.
These pistols were our only weapons. The crowd saw them and hung
back, but if they chose to rush us it wasn’t much of a barrier
two pistols would make.</p>

<p>Rasta’s voice had stopped. He had done his work, and had retired
to the background. There were shouts from the crowd—"<em>Alleman</em>"
and a word "<em>Khafiyeh</em>" constantly repeated. I didn’t know
what it meant at the time, but now I know that they were after
us because we were Boches and spies. There was no love lost between
the Constantinople scum and their new masters. It seemed an ironical
end for Peter and me to be done in because we were Boches. And
done in we should be. I had heard of the East as a good place
for people to disappear in; there were no inquisitive newspapers
or incorruptible police.</p>

<p>I wished to Heaven I had a word of Turkish. But I made my voice
heard for a second in a pause of the din, and shouted that we
were German sailors who had brought down big guns for Turkey,
and were going home next day. I asked them what the devil they
thought we had done? I don’t know if any fellow there understood
German; anyhow, it only brought a pandemonium of cries in which
that ominous word <em>Khafiyeh</em> was predominant.</p>

<p>Then Peter fired over their heads. He had to, for a chap was
pawing at his throat. The answer was a clatter of bullets on the
wall above us. It looked as if they meant to take us alive, and
that I was very clear should not happen. Better a bloody end in
a street scrap than the tender mercies of that bandbox bravo.</p>

<p>I don’t quite know what happened next. A press drove down at
me and I fired. Someone squealed, and I looked the next moment
to be strangled. And then, suddenly, the scrimmage ceased, and
there was a wavering splash of light in that pit of darkness.</p>

<p>I never went through many worse minutes than these. When I had
been hunted in the past weeks there had been mystery enough, but
no immediate peril to face. When I had been up against a real,
urgent, physical risk, like Loos, the danger at any rate had been
clear. One knew what one was in for. But here was a threat I couldn’t
put a name to, and it wasn’t in the future, but pressing hard
at our throats.</p>

<p>And yet I couldn’t feel it was quite real. The patter of the
pistol bullets against the wall, like so many crackers, the faces
felt rather than seen in the dark, the clamour which to me was
pure gibberish, had all the madness of a nightmare. Only Peter,
cursing steadily in Dutch by my side, was real. And then the light
came, and made the scene more eerie!</p>

<p>It came from one or two torches carried by wild fellows with
long staves who drove their way into the heart of the mob. The
flickering glare ran up the steep walls and made monstrous shadows.
The wind swung the flame into long streamers, dying away in a
fan of sparks.</p>

<p>And now a new word was heard in the crowd. It was <em>Chinganeh</em>,
shouted not in anger but in fear.</p>

<p>At first I could not see the newcomers. They were hidden in the
deep darkness under their canopy of light, for they were holding
their torches high at the full stretch of their arms. They were
shouting, too, wild shrill cries ending sometimes in a gush of
rapid speech. Their words did not seem to be directed against
us, but against the crowd. A sudden hope came to me that for some
unknown reason they were on our side.</p>

<p>The press was no longer heavy against us. It was thinning rapidly
and I could hear the scuffle as men made off down the side streets.
My first notion was that these were the Turkish police. But I
changed my mind when the leader came out into a patch of light.
He carried no torch, but a long stave with which he belaboured
the heads of those who were too tightly packed to flee.</p>

<p>It was the most eldritch apparition you can conceive. A tall
man dressed in skins, with bare legs and sandal-shod feet. A wisp
of scarlet cloth clung to his shoulders, and, drawn over his head
down close to his eyes, was a skull-cap of some kind of pelt with
the tail waving behind it. He capered like a wild animal, keeping
up a strange high monotone that fairly gave me the creeps.</p>

<p>I was suddenly aware that the crowd had gone. Before us was only
this figure and his half-dozen companions, some carrying torches
and all wearing clothes of skin. But only the one who seemed to
be their leader wore the skull-cap; the rest had bare heads and
long tangled hair.</p>

<p>The fellow was shouting gibberish at me. His eyes were glassy,
like a man who smokes hemp, and his legs were never still for
a second. You would think such a figure no better than a mountebank,
and yet there was nothing comic in it. Fearful and sinister and
uncanny it was; and I wanted to do anything but laugh.</p>

<p>As he shouted he kept pointing with his stave up the street which
climbed the hillside.</p>

<p>"He means us to move," said Peter. "For God’s sake let us get
away from this witch-doctor."</p>

<p>I couldn’t make sense of it, but one thing was clear. These maniacs
had delivered us for the moment from Rasta and his friends.</p>

<p>Then I did a dashed silly thing. I pulled out a sovereign and
offered it to the leader. I had some kind of notion of showing
gratitude, and as I had no words I had to show it by deed.</p>

<p>He brought his stick down on my wrist and sent the coin spinning
in the gutter. His eyes blazed, and he made his weapon sing round
my head. He cursed me—oh, I could tell cursing well enough, though
I didn’t follow a word; and he cried to his followers and they
cursed me too. I had offered him a mortal insult and stirred up
a worse hornet’s nest than Rasta’s push.</p>

<p>Peter and I, with a common impulse, took to our heels. We were
not looking for any trouble with demoniacs. Up the steep, narrow
lane we ran with that bedlamite crowd at our heels. The torches
seemed to have gone out, for the place was black as pitch, and
we tumbled over heaps of offal and splashed through running drains.
The men were close behind us, and more than once I felt a stick
on my shoulder. But fear lent us wings, and suddenly before us
was a blaze of light and we saw the debouchment of our street
in a main thoroughfare. The others saw it, too, for they slackened
off. Just before we reached the light we stopped and looked round.
There was no sound or sight behind us in the dark lane which dipped
to the harbour.</p>

<p>"This is a queer country, Cornelis," said Peter, feeling his
limbs for bruises. "Too many things happen in too short a time.
I am breathless."</p>

<p>The big street we had struck seemed to run along the crest of
the hill. There were lamps in it, and crawling cabs, and quite
civilized-looking shops. We soon found the hotel to which Kuprasso
had directed us, a big place in a courtyard with a very tumble-down-looking
portico, and green sun-shutters which rattled drearily in the
winter’s wind. It proved, as I had feared, to be packed to the
door, mostly with German officers. With some trouble I got an
interview with the proprietor, the usual Greek, and told him that
we had been sent there by Mr Kuprasso. That didn’t affect him
in the least, and we would have been shot into the street if I
hadn’t remembered about Stumm’s pass.</p>

<p>So I explained that we had come from Germany with munitions and
only wanted rooms for one night. I showed him the pass and blustered
a good deal, till he became civil and said he would do the best
he could for us.</p>

<p>That best was pretty poor. Peter and I were doubled up in a small
room which contained two camp-beds and little else, and had broken
windows through which the wind whistled. We had a wretched dinner
of stringy mutton, boiled with vegetables, and a white cheese
strong enough to raise the dead. But I got a bottle of whisky,
for which I paid a sovereign, and we managed to light the stove
in our room, fasten the shutters, and warm our hearts with a brew
of toddy. After that we went to bed and slept like logs for twelve
hours. On the road from Rustchuk we had had uneasy slumbers.</p>

<p>I woke next morning and, looking out from the broken window,
saw that it was snowing. With a lot of trouble I got hold of a
servant and made him bring us some of the treacly Turkish coffee.
We were both in pretty low spirits. "Europe is a poor cold place,"
said Peter, "not worth fighting for. There is only one white man’s
land, and that is South Africa." At the time I heartily agreed
with him.</p>

<p>I remember that, sitting on the edge of my bed, I took stock
of our position. It was not very cheering. We seemed to have been
amassing enemies at a furious pace. First of all, there was Rasta,
whom I had insulted and who wouldn’t forget it in a hurry. He
had his crowd of Turkish riff-raff and was bound to get us sooner
or later. Then there was the maniac in the skin hat. He didn’t
like Rasta, and I made a guess that he and his weird friends were
of some party hostile to the Young Turks. But, on the other hand,
he didn’t like us, and there would be bad trouble the next time
we met him. Finally, there was Stumm and the German Government.
It could only be a matter of hours at the best before he got the
Rustchuk authorities on our trail. It would be easy to trace us
from Chataldja, and once they had us we were absolutely done.
There was a big black <em>dossier</em> against us, which by no
conceivable piece of luck could be upset.</p>

<p>It was very clear to me that, unless we could find sanctuary
and shed all our various pursuers during this day, we should be
done in for good and all. But where on earth were we to find sanctuary?
We had neither of us a word of the language, and there was no
way I could see of taking on new characters. For that we wanted
friends and help, and I could think of none anywhere. Somewhere,
to be sure, there was Blenkiron, but how could we get in touch
with him? As for Sandy, I had pretty well given him up. I always
thought his enterprise the craziest of the lot and bound to fail.
He was probably somewhere in Asia Minor, and a month or two later
would get to Constantinople and hear in some pot-house the yarn
of the two wretched Dutchmen who had disappeared so soon from
men’s sight.</p>

<p>That rendezvous at Kuprasso’s was no good. It would have been
all right if we had got here unsuspected, and could have gone
on quietly frequenting the place till Blenkiron picked us up.
But to do that we wanted leisure and secrecy, and here we were
with a pack of hounds at our heels. The place was horribly dangerous
already. If we showed ourselves there we should be gathered in
by Rasta, or by the German military police, or by the madman in
the skin cap. It was a stark impossibility to hang about on the
off-chance of meeting Blenkiron.</p>

<p>I reflected with some bitterness that this was the 17th day of
January, the day of our assignation. I had had high hopes all
the way down the Danube of meeting with Blenkiron—for I knew he
would be in time—of giving him the information I had had the good
fortune to collect, of piecing it together with what he had found
out, and of getting the whole story which Sir Walter hungered
for. After that, I thought it wouldn’t be hard to get away by
Rumania, and to get home through Russia. I had hoped to be back
with my battalion in February, having done as good a bit of work
as anybody in the war. As it was, it looked as if my information
would die with me, unless I could find Blenkiron before the evening.</p>

<p>I talked the thing over with Peter, and he agreed that we were
fairly up against it. We decided to go to Kuprasso’s that afternoon,
and to trust to luck for the rest. It wouldn’t do to wander about
the streets, so we sat tight in our room all morning, and swopped
old hunting yarns to keep our minds from the beastly present.
We got some food at midday—cold mutton and the same cheese, and
finished our whisky. Then I paid the bill, for I didn’t dare to
stay there another night. About half-past three we went into the
street, without the foggiest notion where we would find our next
quarters.</p>

<p>It was snowing heavily, which was a piece of luck for us. Poor
old Peter had no greatcoat, so we went into a Jew’s shop and bought
a ready-made abomination, which looked as if it might have been
meant for a dissenting parson. It was no good saving my money
when the future was so black. The snow made the streets deserted,
and we turned down the long lane which led to Ratchik ferry, and
found it perfectly quiet. I do not think we met a soul till we
got to Kuprasso’s shop.</p>

<p>We walked straight through the cafe, which was empty, and down
the dark passage, till we were stopped by the garden door. I knocked
and it swung open. There was the bleak yard, now puddled with
snow, and a blaze of light from the pavilion at the other end.
There was a scraping of fiddles, too, and the sound of human talk.
We paid the negro at the door, and passed from the bitter afternoon
into a garish saloon.</p>

<p>There were forty or fifty people there, drinking coffee and sirops
and filling the air with the fumes of latakia. Most of them were
Turks in European clothes and the fez, but there were some German
officers and what looked like German civilians—Army Service Corps
clerks, probably, and mechanics from the Arsenal. A woman in cheap
finery was tinkling at the piano, and there were several shrill
females with the officers. Peter and I sat down modestly in the
nearest corner, where old Kuprasso saw us and sent us coffee.
A girl who looked like a Jewess came over to us and talked French,
but I shook my head and she went off again.</p>

<p>Presently a girl came on the stage and danced, a silly affair,
all a clashing of tambourines and wriggling. I have seen native
women do the same thing better in a Mozambique kraal. Another
sang a German song, a simple, sentimental thing about golden hair
and rainbows, and the Germans present applauded. The place was
so tinselly and common that, coming to it from weeks of rough
travelling, it made me impatient. I forgot that, while for the
others it might be a vulgar little dancing-hall, for us it was
as perilous as a brigands’ den.</p>

<p>Peter did not share my mood. He was quite interested in it, as
he was interested in everything new. He had a genius for living
in the moment.</p>

<p>I remember there was a drop-scene on which was daubed a blue
lake with very green hills in the distance. As the tobacco smoke
grew thicker and the fiddles went on squealing, this tawdry picture
began to mesmerize me. I seemed to be looking out of a window
at a lovely summer landscape where there were no wars or danger.
I seemed to feel the warm sun and to smell the fragrance of blossom
from the islands. And then I became aware that a queer scent had
stolen into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>There were braziers burning at both ends to warm the room, and
the thin smoke from these smelt like incense. Somebody had been
putting a powder in the flames, for suddenly the place became
very quiet. The fiddles still sounded, but far away like an echo.
The lights went down, all but a circle on the stage, and into
that circle stepped my enemy of the skin cap.</p>

<p>He had three others with him. I heard a whisper behind me, and
the words were those which Kuprasso had used the day before. These
bedlamites were called the Companions of the Rosy Hours, and Kuprasso
had promised great dancing.</p>

<p>I hoped to goodness they would not see us, for they had fairly
given me the horrors. Peter felt the same, and we both made ourselves
very small in that dark corner. But the newcomers had no eyes
for us.</p>

<p>In a twinkling the pavilion changed from a common saloon, which
might have been in Chicago or Paris, to a place of mystery—yes,
and of beauty. It became the Garden-House of Suliman the Red,
whoever that sportsman may have been. Sandy had said that the
ends of the earth converged there, and he had been right. I lost
all consciousness of my neighbours—stout German, frock-coated
Turk, frowsy Jewess—and saw only strange figures leaping in a
circle of light, figures that came out of the deepest darkness
to make a big magic.</p>

<p>The leader flung some stuff into the brazier, and a great fan
of blue light flared up. He was weaving circles, and he was singing
something shrill and high, whilst his companions made a chorus
with their deep monotone. I can’t tell you what the dance was.
I had seen the Russian ballet just before the war, and one of
the men in it reminded me of this man. But the dancing was the
least part of it. It was neither sound nor movement nor scent
that wrought the spell, but something far more potent. In an instant
I found myself reft away from the present with its dull dangers,
and looking at a world all young and fresh and beautiful. The
gaudy drop-scene had vanished. It was a window I was looking from,
and I was gazing at the finest landscape on earth, lit by the
pure clean light of morning.</p>

<p>It seemed to be part of the veld, but like no veld I had ever
seen. It was wider and wilder and more gracious. Indeed, I was
looking at my first youth. I was feeling the kind of immortal
light-heartedness which only a boy knows in the dawning of his
days. I had no longer any fear of these magic-makers. They were
kindly wizards, who had brought me into fairyland.</p>

<p>Then slowly from the silence there distilled drops of music.
They came like water falling a long way into a cup, each the essential
quality of pure sound. We, with our elaborate harmonies, have
forgotten the charm of single notes. The African natives know
it, and I remember a learned man once telling me that the Greeks
had the same art. Those silver bells broke out of infinite space,
so exquisite and perfect that no mortal words could have been
fitted to them. That was the music, I expect, that the morning
stars made when they sang together.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, it changed. The glow passed from blue to
purple, and then to an angry red. Bit by bit the notes spun together
till they had made a harmony—a fierce, restless harmony. And I
was conscious again of the skin-clad dancers beckoning out of
their circle.</p>

<p>There was no mistake about the meaning now. All the daintiness
and youth had fled, and passion was beating the air—terrible,
savage passion, which belonged neither to day nor night, life
nor death, but to the half-world between them. I suddenly felt
the dancers as monstrous, inhuman, devilish. The thick scents
that floated from the brazier seemed to have a tang of new-shed
blood. Cries broke from the hearers—cries of anger and lust and
terror. I heard a woman sob, and Peter, who is as tough as any
mortal, took tight hold of my arm.</p>

<p>I now realized that these Companions of the Rosy Hours were the
only thing in the world to fear. Rasta and Stumm seemed feeble
simpletons by contrast. The window I had been looking out of was
changed to a prison wall—I could see the mortar between the massive
blocks. In a second these devils would be smelling out their enemies
like some foul witch-doctors. I felt the burning eyes of their
leader looking for me in the gloom. Peter was praying audibly
beside me, and I could have choked him. His infernal chatter would
reveal us, for it seemed to me that there was no one in the place
except us and the magic-workers.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the spell was broken. The door was flung open and
a great gust of icy wind swirled through the hall, driving clouds
of ashes from the braziers. I heard loud voices without, and a
hubbub began inside. For a moment it was quite dark, and then
someone lit one of the flare lamps by the stage. It revealed nothing
but the common squalor of a low saloon—white faces, sleepy eyes,
and frowsy heads. The drop-piece was there in all its tawdriness.</p>

<p>The Companions of the Rosy Hours had gone. But at the door stood
men in uniform, I heard a German a long way off murmur, "Enver’s
bodyguards," and I heard him distinctly; for, though I could not
see clearly, my hearing was desperately acute. That is often the
way when you suddenly come out of a swoon.</p>

<p>The place emptied like magic. Turk and German tumbled over each
other, while Kuprasso wailed and wept. No one seemed to stop them,
and then I saw the reason. Those Guards had come for us. This
must be Stumm at last. The authorities had tracked us down, and
it was all up with Peter and me.</p>

<p>A sudden revulsion leaves a man with a low vitality. I didn’t
seem to care greatly. We were done, and there was an end of it.
It was Kismet, the act of God, and there was nothing for it but
to submit. I hadn’t a flicker of a thought of escape or resistance.
The game was utterly and absolutely over.</p>

<p>A man who seemed to be a sergeant pointed to us and said something
to Kuprasso, who nodded. We got heavily to our feet and stumbled
towards them. With one on each side of us we crossed the yard,
walked through the dark passage and the empty shop, and out into
the snowy street. There was a closed carriage waiting which they
motioned us to get into. It looked exactly like the Black Maria.</p>

<p>Both of us sat still, like truant schoolboys, with our hands
on our knees. I didn’t know where I was going and I didn’t care.
We seemed to be rumbling up the hill, and then I caught the glare
of lighted streets.</p>

<p>"This is the end of it, Peter," I said.</p>

<p>"<em>Ja</em>, Cornelis," he replied, and that was all our talk.</p>

<p>By and by—hours later it seemed—we stopped. Someone opened the
door and we got out, to find ourselves in a courtyard with a huge
dark building around. The prison, I guessed, and I wondered if
they would give us blankets, for it was perishing cold.</p>

<p>We entered a door, and found ourselves in a big stone hall. It
was quite warm, which made me more hopeful about our cells. A
man in some kind of uniform pointed to the staircase, up which
we plodded wearily. My mind was too blank to take clear impressions,
or in any way to forecast the future. Another warder met us and
took us down a passage till we halted at a door. He stood aside
and motioned us to enter.</p>

<p>I guessed that this was the governor’s room, and we should be
put through our first examination. My head was too stupid to think,
and I made up my mind to keep perfectly mum. Yes, even if they
tried thumbscrews. I had no kind of story, but I resolved not
to give anything away. As I turned the handle I wondered idly
what kind of sallow Turk or bulging-necked German we should find
inside.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant room, with a polished wood floor and a big
fire burning on the hearth. Beside the fire a man lay on a couch,
with a little table drawn up beside him. On that table was a small
glass of milk and a number of Patience cards spread in rows.</p>

<p>I stared blankly at the spectacle, till I saw a second figure.
It was the man in the skin-cap, the leader of the dancing maniacs.
Both Peter and I backed sharply at the sight and then stood stock
still.</p>

<p>For the dancer crossed the room in two strides and gripped both
of my hands.</p>

<p>"Dick, old man," he cried, "I’m most awfully glad to see you
again!"</p>
