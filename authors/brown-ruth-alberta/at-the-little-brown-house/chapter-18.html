<p>Hardly had the four younger girls disappeared across the fields
on the way to school the next morning, when the Abbott carriage
drew up in front of the little brown house, and Cecile and Frances
hurried up the path to the door. Gail answered the imperative
knock, and looked so surprised and pleased at the unexpected call
that the Judge's daughter's face crimsoned with contrition and
shame to think she had neglected this old-time friend so long.</p>

<p>"Why, Cecile!" stammered Gail, glancing involuntarily from the
girls' fresh, white suits to her own shabby print frock and rolled-up
sleeves. "This is a great treat. Come right in! We are so glad
to have you call. Don't apologize; you are more than welcome.
But please excuse my appearance. It is Monday morning and Faith
and I are washing."</p>

<p>"Then don't you apologize, either," said Cecile, trying to laugh
easily and failing utterly. "We should not have called at this
outrageous hour, but Frances is to return to the city this afternoon,
and she insisted upon coming to see about the children before
she left."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The bright light died from Gail's eyes, and the girls looked
uncomfortable. So it was an errand after all and not a friendly
call which brought them. "What is the matter with the children?
Has Peace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, oh, no, nothing has happened," Cecile began hastily, when
Frances interrupted, "It was on my account. Your little whistler
has captivated me completely&mdash;and mamma, too. We wanted to know
if we might borrow them next Saturday, Peace and Allee, to help
out in the program at a party I am giving that night. Oh, don't
say no! I have set my heart on it. We will take the best care
of them and bring them home early Sunday morning. We are coming
out here for dinner at Mr. Strong's house that day, and of course
must arrive in time for church service. Please say we can borrow
them. I do want them <em>so</em> much!"</p>

<p>"Dear me," exclaimed Cecile in mortification. "I haven't even
introduced you two girls. No wonder you think I am crazy, Gail.
This is my chum from Martindale, Miss Sherrar, Miss Greenfield&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm Frances," again the radiant-faced stranger interrupted.</p>

<p>"And I am Gail," smiled the other. "I have heard the Strongs
speak of you often."</p>

<p>"No oftener than we have heard them speak about you," Frances
assured her. "We have known both of them for years, and ever since
they took charge here in Parker we have heard lots about you."</p>

<p>"No doubt. Mr. Strong is quite a champion of Peace's, and she
certainly needs one. I am afraid I don't make much of a success
in bringing up the little ones."</p>

<p>"I think Peace is a perfect cherub&mdash;in looks."</p>

<p>The trio laughed merrily, and Cecile added, "She means to be
in actions, but nothing she ever does comes out the way she intended
it to, and she keeps everyone guessing as to what she will do
next. You ought to hear Daddy rave about her. He thinks she is
the smartest child he ever saw."</p>

<p>"I think she is the sweetest," said Frances, "she and Allee.
They are both too cunning for anything. I simply must have them
at my party. Won't you say they can come?"</p>

<p>"They have nothing to wear for such a grand occasion," Gail hesitated,
anxious to please, and yet not quite willing to trust two of the
precious sisters with strangers for even a twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>"That is easily remedied. I have some little cousins who are
sure to have dresses that will fit. It is to be rather a dress-parade,
I must admit, but you needn't worry on that account. Mamma knows
how to fix them up in Sara's and Marion's clothes. We must have
them. Mr. Strong will give us a good recommend, I know."</p>

<p>Gail laughed. "There is no need of that at all. I am willing
that they should go, only you can hardly blame me for hesitating
a little, as this will be the first time either one has been away
from home over night; and besides, Peace is such a blunderbus,
I rather dread to let her go anywhere for fear she will get into
trouble."</p>

<p>"Now you oughtn't to feel that way at all," cried Frances gaily.
"<em>I</em> was just such a child as she is, and see what a well-behaved
young lady <em>I</em> have grown to be! But really, she has such
a sweet disposition and great, tender heart, she will come out
all right, I know. Mr. Strong says so, and he is a splendid character
reader. Oh, of course, I suppose she has her bad days. We all
do, but she is too much of a darling to stay bad long. You should
hear your preacher sermonize about her. He says just as sure as
she gets into mischief of any kind she comes to him and tells
him all about it, cries over it, and goes away promising to be
a better girl. Oh, I have lost my heart to her completely! We
won't let her get into mischief of any kind, I promise. And I
know she will enjoy herself."</p>

<p>"Well," answered Gail, slowly, "they may go, if you wish them
so badly. How&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cecile will bring them when she comes Saturday morning, if you
are willing. That will give us plenty of time to get everything
fixed up properly. I thank you so much for your permission; and,
Gail, though we must hurry away this morning, the next time I
come out here for a visit, I shall run in to see you for a nice
long chat. May I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you just would!" cried gentle Gail impulsively, longing
to take the bright face between her hands and kiss it. "We are
too busy here to get out very much ourselves, but we do like company
'awfully bad,' as Peace used to say. I hope you come soon. The
children will be ready for Cecile Saturday when she gets here.
Good-bye, I am sorry you must go so soon. Come again, Cecile."
The girls were gone, and Gail went back to her wash-tubs in a
daze.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the little girls were wild with excitement when
told of the coming gala day, and Cherry was green-eyed with envy,
though, like the well-behaved child she was, she never said a
word to mar the beautiful time in store for the two more fortunate
sisters. Long before Cecile arrived Saturday morning, the stiffly-starched
duet stood on the steps, waiting in a fever of impatience; and
by the time the Sherrar house in the great city was reached, both
little girls were almost transported with joy. They nearly talked
Cecile's head off, so eager were they to find out all about the
grand party, and everything else of interest they could think
of; so she was more than relieved to turn her lively charges over
to Frances the minute that young lady put in appearance.</p>

<p>"You little darlings!" the hostess exclaimed at sight of them.
"Take them right upstairs, Sophy; mamma wants them at once. Cecile,
you look tired out. Oh, yes, I can understand just how you feel
for Sara and Marion were here all day yesterday, and what do you
think? They haven't a thing suitable for us to borrow. Mamma says
we'll have to go downtown and buy something ready-made for Peace
and Allee. She is dressing now, and if you aren't too tired, I'm
going to drag you along."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm never too tired for gadding," replied Cecile with animation.
"But I can't answer half the questions those chatterboxes ask,
and this morning Allee was as bad as Peace. She wants to know
if a chandelier crows and is just an ordinary rooster. Peace thinks
those green-houses we pass on the car ought to be called 'white-houses,'
because they are painted white. Just before we got off at our
avenue she suddenly demanded to know for whom 'Vandrevort Street'
was named. I couldn't think for the life of me what she meant
until I remembered we cross Twenty-fourth Street, and the conductor
was a foreigner who doesn't pronounce his words distinctly. She
is possessed to know why, if the world is round, the houses on
the other side don't fall off; and why, when we lift our feet
to step, they always come down to the earth again instead of staying
in the air. Why is it we can't pick ourselves up in our own arms;
why don't women's shoes hook up like men's; what is the reason
policemen's clothes are always blue and the grass is never anything
but green; why don't mules look like horses and what makes them
kick?"</p>

<p>Cecile stopped for breath, and Frances screamed with delight.
"Maybe we better stop and consult the doctor while we are in town,"
she suggested.</p>

<p>"No, I guess that won't be necessary now, for I have resigned
them to your tender mercies, and you must answer their questions
after this. If you don't get enough of it, Frances Sherrar, before
tomorrow morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't prophesy, Cecile! If they can hold a candle to Marion
and Sara, I'll give you my opal ring."</p>

<p>"I stand a pretty good chance of getting the ring, then," answered
Cecile, half-laughing, half-serious; but at that moment Mrs. Sherrar
hustled down the stairway, with the two children in her wake,
and the merry group set out for town.</p>

<p>"This is the corner, mamma," said Frances, as the car came to
a standstill at one of the busiest streets; "and, oh, if there
aren't Mrs. Tate and Lucy! I haven't seen them for an age. Hurry,
mamma, you know you are as anxious to see them as I am."</p>

<p>Peace and Allee found themselves bundled hurriedly down the steps,
jerked through the surging crowd of people, teams and automobiles
in street, and landed on the opposite corner breathless, but game.</p>

<p>"Stay right here," they heard Mrs. Sherrar say; and the next
instant the older members of the party were wholly absorbed with
those unexpectedly-met friends. The children listened impatiently
for a few moments, but finding the conversation very uninteresting,
looked about them for other more congenial amusement.</p>

<p>Just then a wheezy old hand-organ behind them began a familiar
melody, and Peace beheld the player, a bent, white-haired, blind
man, sitting in the shadow of a lamp-post on the edge of the curbing,
slowly, patiently turning the crank of the little machine. She
was at his side in an instant, staring into the sightless face
with her great, brown, pitying eyes. His clothes were very shabby,
his cheeks were pinched and pale; his cup, she noticed, stood
empty on the top of the organ; his hands were terribly thin, and
trembled as he played, so that he had to stop frequently between
songs and rest.</p>

<p>"Are you sick, Mr. Blind-man?" she asked before she was aware
she had spoken her thoughts aloud.</p>

<p>The white, unseeing eyes of the organist turned in the direction
of the voice, and he answered with a show of cheerfulness, "Not
now, little lady."</p>

<p>"Then you have been?"</p>

<p>"Yes, this is my first day out for two weeks."</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor man! It must tire you dreadfully to have to grind
that box all day. Won't you let me try it awhile? I know I can
do it all right. You can count your money while I play."</p>

<p>"There ain't been any to count so far this morning," he murmured,
unconsciously dropping his hand from the organ as the quaint,
old-fashioned song was finished; and before he had a chance to
remonstrate, Peace had seized the crank with both hands, and was
grinding away with all her might. But, though the crank seemed
to turn easily enough, the music came in jerks, and the blind
player took possession of his organ the minute she had completed
the last bar, saying gently, "I am afraid you don't know how to
make the music, little one. But I thank you a thousand times for
your great good-will. I shall soon be strong enough to play as
well as I always have. The first day is a little hard. Tomorrow
it will be better. We'll change the roll now, and give them another
tune." He fumbled about the organ for a moment or two, and then
the strains of <em>Annie Laurie</em> filled the air.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that!" cried Peace, with animation. "Allee, you come
and sing, while I whistle. We can do it lovely. Now begin again."</p>

<p>Nothing loath to humor his strange, sympathetic little guests,
he began the second time to grind out the wheezy notes of the
beautiful, time-honored song, and Peace's red lips took up the
accompaniment, while Allee's sweet, childish voice warbled the
words:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Maxwellton braes are bonnie,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where early fa's the dew,<br/>
And it's there that Annie Laurie<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gied me her promise true&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gied me her promise true,<br/>
Which ne'er forgot will be;<br/>
And for bonnie Annie Laurie<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd lay me doon and dee."

</p>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Sherrar wheeled in amazement at the sound; the girls broke
off their animated conversation to stare at the quaint group on
the corner; a crowd gathered quickly; and with sudden, characteristic
impulsiveness, Peace caught up the battered tin cup from the old
hand-organ, and held it out invitingly. Hand after hand plunged
deep into scores of pockets; coin after coin rattled into the
little dipper; the old man played eagerly, breathlessly; and the
children sang again and again in response to the applause from
the street.</p>

<p>How long the impromptu concert might have continued no one knows,
but through a break in the sea of faces surrounding them, Peace
caught a glimpse of Mrs. Sherrar's portly form, and it reminded
her suddenly of where she was and how she came to be there. Breaking
off in the midst of her song, she thrust the heavy cup back into
the owner's hands, bowed to the astonished throng, and cried shrilly,
"He's been sick and can't play as much as he used to could, until
he gets strong again; so he needs all the money he can get. Don't
forget him when you go by again."</p>

<p>Grabbing Allee by the arm, she whisked away to where her friends
were waiting, fearful lest they might not approve of her impulsive
action; so before they had a chance to speak a word either of
blame or praise, she began, excusingly, "Just s'posing we all
had our eyes punched out so's we couldn't see, and had to sit
on street corners and grind out music all day long. Wouldn't it
be terrible? I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>thought&mdash;maybe it might help
a little if we joined in the music, and it did. He's got a whole
cupful of money, and now maybe he'll go home and rest a bit. He's
been sick."</p>

<p>Tears filled the eyes of the little company of grown-ups, and
Frances, with an understanding heart, drew the childish figures
close, saying tenderly, "For these bonnie little lassies I'd lay
me doon and dee."</p>
