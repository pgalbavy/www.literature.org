<p>From the bed set high on a dais came eerie spasms of laughter,
a harsh cackle like fowls at feeding time.</p>

<p>"Is that the last of them, Anton?" said a voice.</p>

<p>A little serving-man with an apple-hued face bowed in reply.
He bowed with difficulty, for in his arms he held a huge grey
cat, which still mewed with the excitement of the chase. Rats
had been turned loose on the floor, and it had accounted for them
to the accompaniment of a shrill urging from the bed. Now the
sport was over, and the domestics who had crowded round the door
to see it had slipped away, leaving only Anton and the cat.</p>

<p>"Give Tib a full meal of offal," came the order, "and away with
yourself. Your rats are a weak breed. Get me the stout grey monsters
like Tuesday se'ennight."</p>

<p>The room was empty now save for two figures both wearing the
habit of the religious. Near the bed sat a man in the full black
robe and hood of the monks of Cluny. He warmed plump hands at
the brazier and seemed at ease and at home. By the door stood
a different figure in the shabby clothes of a parish priest, a
curate from the kirk of St. Martin's who had been a scandalised
spectator of the rat hunt. He shuffled his feet as if uncertain
of his next step&mdash;a thin, pale man with a pinched mouth and timid
earnest eyes.</p>

<p>The glance from the bed fell on him "What will the fellow be
at?" said the voice testily. "He stands there like a sow about
to litter, and stares and grunts. Good e'en to you, friend. When
you are wanted you will be sent for Jesu's name, what have I done
to have that howlet glowering at me?"</p>

<p>The priest at the words crossed himself and turned to go, with
a tinge of red in his sallow cheeks. He was faithful to his duties
and had come to console a death bed, though he was well aware
that his consolations would be spurned.</p>

<p>As he left there came again the eerie laughter from the bed.
"Ugh, I am weary of that incomparable holiness. He hovers about
to give me the St. John's Cup, and would fain speed my passing.
But I do not die yet, good father. There's life still in the old
wolf."</p>

<p>The monk in a bland voice spoke some Latin to the effect that
mortal times and seasons were ordained of God. The other stretched
out a skinny hand from the fur coverings and rang a silver bell.
When Anton appeared she gave the order "Bring supper for the reverend
father," at which the Cluniac's face mellowed into complacence.</p>

<p>It was a Friday evening in a hard February. Out-of-doors the
snow lay deep in the streets of Bruges, and every canal was frozen
solid so that carts rumbled along them as on a street. A wind
had risen which drifted the powdery snow and blew icy draughts
through every chink. The small-paned windows of the great upper-room
were filled with oiled vellum, but they did not keep out the weather,
and currents of cold air passed through them to the doorway, making
the smoke of the four charcoal braziers eddy and swirl. The place
was warm, yet shot with bitter gusts, and the smell of burning
herbs gave it the heaviness of a chapel at high mass. Hanging
silver lamps, which blazed blue and smoky, lit it in patches,
sufficient to show the cleanness of the rush-strewn floor, the
glory of the hangings of cloth-of-gold and damask, and the burnished
sheen of the metal-work. There was no costlier chamber in that
rich city.</p>

<p>It was a strange staging for death, for the woman on the high
bed was dying. Slowly, fighting every inch of the way with a grim
tenacity, but indubitably dying. Her vital ardour had sunk below
the mark from which it could rise again, and was now ebbing as
water runs from a little crack in a pitcher. The best leeches
in all Flanders and Artois had come to doctor her. They had prescribed
the horrid potions of the age: tinctures of earth-worms; confections
of spiders and wood-lice and viper's flesh; broth of human skulls,
oil, wine, ants' eggs, and crabs' claws; the <em>bufo preparatus</em>,
which was a live toad roasted in a pot and ground to a powder;
and innumerable plaisters and electuaries. She had begun by submitting
meekly, for she longed to live, and had ended, for she was a shrewd
woman, by throwing the stuff at the apothecaries' heads. Now she
ordained her own diet, which was of lamb's flesh lightly boiled,
and woman's milk, got from a wench in the purlieus of St. Sauveur.
The one medicine which she retained was powdered elk's horn, which
had been taken from the beast between two festivals of the Virgin.
This she had from the foresters in the Houthulst woods, and swallowed
it in white wine an hour after every dawn.</p>

<p>The bed was a noble thing of ebony, brought by the Rhine road
from Venice, and carved with fantastic hunting scenes by Hainault
craftsmen. Its hangings were stiff brocaded silver, and above
the pillows a great unicorn's horn, to protect against poisoning,
stood out like the beak of a ship. The horn cast an odd shadow
athwart the bed, so that a big claw seemed to lie on the coverlet
curving towards the throat of her who lay there. The parish priest
had noticed this at his first coming that evening, and had muttered
fearful prayers.</p>

<p>The face on the pillows was hard to discern in the gloom, but
when Anton laid the table for the Cluniac's meal and set a lamp
on it, he lit up the cavernous interior of the bed, so that it
became the main thing in the chamber. It was the face of a woman
who still retained the lines and the colouring of youth. The voice
had harshened with age, and the hair was white as wool, but the
cheeks were still rosy and the grey eyes still had fire. Notable
beauty had once been there. The finely arched brows, the oval
of the face which the years had scarcely sharpened, the proud,
delicate nose, all spoke of it. It was as if their possessor recognised
those things and would not part with them, for her attire had
none of the dishevelment of a sickroom. Her coif of fine silk
was neatly adjusted, and the great robe of marten's fur which
cloaked her shoulders was fastened with a jewel of rubies which
glowed in the lamplight like a star.</p>

<p>Something chattered beside her. It was a little brown monkey
which had made a nest in the warm bedclothes.</p>

<p>She watched with sharp eyes the setting of the table. It was
a Friday's meal and the guest was a monk, so it followed a fashion,
but in that house of wealth, which had links with the ends of
the earth, the monotony was cunningly varied. There were oysters
from the Boulogne coast, and lampreys from the Loire, and pickled
salmon from England. There was a dish of liver dressed with rice
and herbs in the manner of the Turk, for liver, though contained
in flesh, was not reckoned as flesh by liberal churchmen. There
was a roast goose from the shore marshes, that barnacle bird which
pious epicures classed as shell-fish and thought fit for fast
days. A silver basket held a store of thin toasted rye-cakes,
and by the monk's hand stood a flagon of that drink most dear
to holy palates, the rich syrupy hippocras.</p>

<p>The woman looked on the table with approval, for her house had
always prided itself upon its good fare. The Cluniac's urbane
composure was stirred to enthusiasm. He said a <em>Confiteor tibi
Domine</em>, rolling the words on his tongue as if in anticipation
of the solider mouthfuls awaiting him. The keen weather had whetted
his appetite and he thanked God that his northern peregrinations
had brought him to a house where the Church was thus honoured.
He had liked the cavalier treatment of the lean parish priest,
a sour dog who brought his calling into disfavour with the rich
and godly. He tucked back his sleeves, adjusted the linen napkin
comfortably about his neck, and fell to with a will. He raised
his first glass of hippocras and gave thanks to his hostess. A
true mother in Israel!</p>

<p>She was looking at him with favour. He was the breed of monk
that she liked, suave, well-mannered, observant of men and cities.
Already he had told her entertaining matter about the French King's
court, and the new Burgrave of Ghent, and the escapades of Count
Baldwin. He had lived much among gentlefolk and kept his ears
open.... She felt stronger and cheerfuller than she had been for
days. That rat-hunt had warmed her blood. She was a long way from
death in spite of the cackle of idiot chirurgeons, and there was
much savour still in the world. There was her son, too, the young
Philip.... Her eye saw clearer, and she noted the sombre magnificence
of the great room, the glory of the brocade, the gleam of silver.
Was she not the richest woman in all Bruges, aye, and in all Hainault
and Guelderland? And the credit was her own. After the fashion
of age in such moods her mind flew backward, and she saw very
plain a narrow street in a wind-swept town looking out on a bleak
sea. She had been cold, then, and hungry, and deathly poor. Well,
she had travelled some way from that hovel. She watched the thick
carved stems of the candlesticks and felt a spacious ease and
power.</p>

<p>The Cluniac was speaking. He had supped so well that he was in
love with the world.</p>

<p>"Your house and board, my lady, are queen-like. I have seen worse
in palaces."</p>

<p>Her laugh was only half pleased. "Too fine, you would add, for
a burgher wife. Maybe, but rank is but as man makes it. The Kings
of England are sprung of a tanner. Hark you, father! I made a
vow to God when I was a maid, and I have fulfilled my side of
the bargain. I am come of a nobler race than any Markgrave, aye,
than the Emperor himself, and I swore to set the seed of my body,
which the Lord might grant me, again among the great ones. Have
I not done it? Is not Philip, my son, affianced to that pale girl
of Avesnes, and with more acres of pleasant land to his name than
any knightlet in Artois?"</p>

<p>The Cluniac bowed a courtly head. "It is a great alliance&mdash;but
not above the dignity of your house."</p>

<p>"House you call it, and I have had the making of it. What was
Willebald but a plain merchant-man, one of many scores at the
Friday Market? Willebald was clay that I moulded and gilded till
God put him to bed under a noble lid in the New Kirk. A worthy
man, but loutish and slow like one of his own hookers. Yet when
I saw him on the plainstones by the English harbour I knew that
he was a weapon made for my hand."</p>

<p>Her voice had become even and gentle as of one who remembers
far-away things. The Cluniac, having dipped his hands in a silver
basin, was drying them in the brazier's heat. Presently he set
to picking his teeth daintily with a quill, and fell into the
listener's pose. From long experience he knew the atmosphere which
heralds confidences, and was willing to humour the provider of
such royal fare.</p>

<p>"You have never journeyed to King's Lynn?" said the voice from
the bed. "There is little to see there but mudbars and fens and
a noisy sea. There I dwelt when I was fifteen years of age, a
maid hungry in soul and body. I knew I was of the seed of Forester
John and through him the child of a motley of ancient kings, but
war and famine had stripped our house to the bone. And now I,
the last of the stock, dwelt with a miserly mother's uncle who
did shipwright's work for the foreign captains. The mirror told
me that I was fair to look on, though ill-nourished, and my soul
assured me that I had no fear. Therefore I had hope, but I ate
my heart out waiting on fortune."</p>

<p>She was looking at the monk with unseeing eyes, her head half
turned towards him.</p>

<p>"Then came Willebald one March morning. I saw him walk up the
jetty in a new red cloak, a personable man with a broad beard
and a jolly laugh. I knew him by repute as the luckiest of the
Flemish venturers. In him I saw my fortune. That night he supped
at my uncle's house and a week later he sought me in marriage.
My uncle would have bargained, but I had become a grown woman
and silenced him. With Willebald I did not chaffer, for I read
his heart and knew that in a little he would be wax to me. So
we were wed, and I took to him no dowry but a ring which came
to me from my forebears, and a brain that gold does not buy."</p>

<p>The monkey by her side broke into a chattering.</p>

<p>"Peace, Peterkin," she said. "You mind me of the babbling of
the merchant-folk, when I spurred Willebald into new roads. He
had done as his father before him, and bought wool and salted
fish from the English, paying with the stuffs of our Flemish looms.
A good trade of small and sure profits, but I sought bigger quarries.
For, mark you, there was much in England that had a value in this
country of ours which no Englishman guessed."</p>

<p>"Of what nature?" the monk asked with curiosity in his voice.</p>

<p>"Roman things. Once in that land of bogs and forests there were
bustling Roman towns and rich Roman houses, which disappeared
as every tide brought in new robbers from the sea. Yes, but not
all. Much of the preciousness was hidden and the place of its
hiding forgotten. Bit by bit the churls found the treasure-trove,
but they did not tell their lords. They melted down jewels and
sold them piecemeal to Jews for Jews' prices, and what they did
not recognise as precious they wantonly destroyed. I have seen
the marble heads of heathen gods broken with the hammer to make
mortar of, and great cups of onyx and alabaster used as water
troughs for a thrall's mongrels.... Knowing the land, I sent pedlars
north and west to collect such stuff, and what I bought for pence
I sold for much gold in the Germanies and throughout the French
cities. Thus Willebald amassed wealth, till it was no longer worth
his while to travel the seas. We lived snug in Flanders, and our
servants throughout the broad earth were busy getting us gear."</p>

<p>The Cluniac was all interest. The making of money lay very near
the heart of his Order. "I have heard wondrous tales of your enterprise,"
he told her. "I would fain know the truth."</p>

<p>"Packman's tricks," she laughed. "Nevertheless it is a good story.
For I turned my eyes to the East, whence come those things that
make the pride of life. The merchants of Venice were princes,
and it was in my head to make those of Bruges no worse. What did
it profit that the wind turned daily the sails of our three hundred
mills if we limited ourselves to common burgher wares and the
narrow northern markets? We sent emissaries up the Rhine and beyond
the Alps to the Venice princes, and brought hither the spices
and confections of Egypt and the fruits and wines of Greece, and
the woven stuffs of Asia till the marts of Flanders had the savour
of Araby. Presently in our booths could be seen silks of Italy,
and choice metals from Innsbruck, and furs from Muscovy, and strange
birds and beasts from Prester John's country, and at our fairs
such a concourse of outlandish traders as put Venice to shame.
'Twas a long fight and a bitter for Willebald and me, since, mark
you, we had to make a new road over icy mountains, with a horde
of freebooters hanging on the skirts of our merchant trains and
every little burg on the way jealous to hamper us. Yet if the
heart be resolute, barriers will fall. Many times we were on the
edge of beggary, and grievous were our losses, but in the end
we triumphed. There came a day when we had so many bands of the
Free Companions in our pay that the progress of our merchandise
was like that of a great army, and from rivals we made the roadside
burgs our allies, sharing modestly in our ventures. Also there
were other ways. A pilgrim travels unsuspect, for who dare rob
a holy man? and he is free from burgal dues; but if the goods
be small and very precious, pilgrims may carry them."</p>

<p>The monk, as in duty bound, shook a disapproving head.</p>

<p>"Sin, doubtless," said the woman, "but I have made ample atonement.
Did I not buy with a bushel of gold a leg of the blessed St. George
for the New Kirk, and give to St. Martin's a diamond as big as
a thumb nail and so bright that on a dark day it is a candle to
the shrine? Did not I give to our Lady at Aix a crown of ostrich
feathers the marrow of which is not in Christendom?"</p>

<p>"A mother in Israel, in truth," murmured the cleric.</p>

<p>"Yea, in Israel," said the old wife with a chuckle. "Israel was
the kernel of our perplexities. The good Flemings saw no farther
than their noses, and laughed at Willebald when he began his ventures.
When success came, it was easy to win them over, and by admitting
them to a share in our profits get them to fling their caps in
the air and huzza for their benefactors. But the Jews were a tougher
stock. Mark you, father, when God blinded their eyes to the coming
of the Lord Christ, He opened them very wide to all lower matters.
Their imagination is quick to kindle, and they are as bold in
merchantcraft as Charlemagne in war. They saw what I was after
before I had been a month at it, and were quick to profit by my
foresight. There are but two ways to deal with Israelites&mdash;root
them from the face of the earth or make them partners with you.
Willebald would have fought them; I, more wise, bought them at
a price. For two score years they have wrought faithfully for
me. You say well, a mother in Israel!"</p>

<p>"I could wish that a Christian lady had no dealings with the
accursed race," said the Cluniac.</p>

<p>"You could wish folly," was the tart answer. "I am not as your
burgher folk, and on my own affairs I take no man's guiding, be
he monk or merchant. Willebald is long dead; may he sleep in peace,
He was no mate for me, but for what he gave me I repaid him in
the coin he loved best. He was a proud man when he walked through
the Friday Market with every cap doffed. He was ever the burgher,
like the child I bore him."</p>

<p>"I had thought the marriage more fruitful. They spoke of two
children, a daughter and a son."</p>

<p>The woman turned round in her bed so that she faced him. The
monkey whimpered and she cuffed its ears. Her face was sharp and
exultant, and for a sick person her eyes were oddly bright.</p>

<p>"The girl was Willebald's. A poor slip of vulgar stock with the
spirit of a house cat. I would have married her well, for she
was handsome after a fashion, but she thwarted me and chose to
wed a lout of a huckster in the Bredestreet. She shall have her
portion from Willebald's gold, but none from me. But Philip is
true child of mine, and sprung on both sides of high race. Nay,
I name no names, and before men he is of my husband's getting.
But to you at the end of my days I speak the truth. That son of
wrath has rare blood in him. Philip..."</p>

<p>The old face had grown kind. She was looking through the monk
to some happy country of vision. Her thoughts were retracing the
roads of time, and after the way of age she spoke them aloud.
Imperiously she had forgotten her company.</p>

<p>"So long ago," came the tender voice. "It is years since they
told me he was dead among the heathen, fighting by the Lord Baldwin's
side. But I can see him as if it were yesterday, when he rode
into these streets in spring with April blooms at his saddle-bow.
They called him Phadbus in jest, for his face was like the sun....
Willebald, good dull man, was never jealous, and was glad that
his wife should be seen in brave company. Ah, the afternoons at
the baths when we sported like sea-nymphs and sang merry ballads!
And the proud days of Carnival where men and women consorted freely
and without guile like the blessed in Paradise! Such a tide for
lovers!... Did I not lead the dance with him at the Burgrave's
festival, the twain of us braver than morning? Sat I not with
him in the garden of St. Vaast, his head in my lap, while he sang
me virelays of the south? What was Willebald to me or his lean
grey wife to him? He made me his queen, me the burgher wife, at
the jousting at Courtrai, when the horses squealed like pigs in
the mellay and I wept in fear for him. Ah, the lost sweet days!
Philip, my darling, you make a brave gentleman, but you will not
equal him who loved your mother."</p>

<p>The Cluniac was a man of the world whom no confidences could
scandalise. But he had business of his own to speak of that night,
and he thought it wise to break into this mood of reminiscence.</p>

<p>"The young lord, Philip, your son, madam? You have great plans
for him? What does he at the moment?"</p>

<p>The softness went out of the voice and the woman's gaze came
back to the chamber. "That I know not. Travelling the ways of
the world and plucking roadside fruits, for he is no home-bred
and womanish stripling. Wearing his lusty youth on the maids,
I fear. Nay, I forget. He is about to wed the girl of Avesnes
and is already choosing his bridal train. It seems he loves her.
He writes me she has a skin of snow and eyes of vair. I have not
seen her. A green girl, doubtless with a white face and cat's
eyes. But she is of Avesnes, and that blood comes pure from Clovis,
and there is none prouder in Hainault. He will husband her well,
but she will be a clever woman if she tethers to her side a man
of my bearing. He will be for the high road and the battle-front."</p>

<p>"A puissant and peaceable knight, I have heard tell," said the
Cluniac.</p>

<p>"Puissant beyond doubt, and peaceable when his will is served.
He will play boldly for great things and will win them. Ah, monk!
What knows a childless religious of a mother's certainty? 'Twas
not for nothing that I found Willebald and changed the cobbles
of King's Lynn for this fat country. It is gold that brings power,
and the stiffest royal neck must bend to him who has the deep
coffers. It is gold and his high hand that will set my Philip
by the side of kings. Lord Jesus, what a fortune I have made for
him! There is coined money at the goldsmiths' and in my cellars,
and the ships at the ports, and a hundred busy looms, and lands
in Hainault and Artois, and fair houses in Bruges and Ghent. Boats
on the Rhine and many pack trains between Antwerp and Venice are
his, and a wealth of preciousness lies in his name with the Italian
merchants. Likewise there is this dwelling of mine, with plenishing
which few kings could buy. My sands sink in the glass, but as
I lie a-bed I hear the bustle of wains and horses in the streets,
and the talk of shipfolk, and the clatter of my serving men beneath,
and I know that daily, hourly, more riches flow hither to furnish
my son's kingdom."</p>

<p>The monk's eyes sparkled at this vision of wealth, and he remembered
his errand.</p>

<p>"A most noble heritage. But if the Sire God in His inscrutable
providence should call your son to His holy side, what provision
have you made for so mighty a fortune? Does your daughter then
share?"</p>

<p>The face on the pillows became suddenly wicked and very old.
The eyes were lit with hate.</p>

<p>"Not a bezant of which I have the bequeathing. She has something
from Willebald, and her dull husband makes a livelihood. 'Twill
suffice for the female brats, of whom she has brought three into
the world to cumber it.... By the Gospels, she will lie on the
bed she has made. I did not scheme and toil to make gold for such
leaden souls."</p>

<p>"But if your most worthy son should die ere he has begot children,
have you made no disposition?" The monk's voice was pointed with
anxiety, for was not certainty on this point the object of his
journey? The woman perceived it and laughed maliciously.</p>

<p>"I have made dispositions. Such a chapel will be builded in the
New Kirk as Rome cannot equal. Likewise there will be benefactions
for the poor and a great endowment for the monks at St. Sauveur.
If my seed is not to continue on earth I will make favour in Paradise."</p>

<p>"And we of Cluny, madam?" The voice trembled in spite of its
training.</p>

<p>"Nay I have not forgotten Cluny. Its Abbot shall have the gold
flagons from Jerusalem and some wherewithal in money. But what
is this talk? Philip will not die, and like his mother he loves
Holy Church and will befriend her in all her works.... Listen,
father, it is long past the hour when men cease from labour, and
yet my provident folk are busy. Hark to the bustle below. That
will be the convoy from the Vermandois. Jesu, what a night!"</p>

<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>Flurries of snow beat on windows, and draughts stirred the hot
ashes in the braziers and sent the smoke from them in odd spirals
about the chamber. It had become perishing cold, and the monkey
among the bedclothes whimpered and snuggled closer into his nest.
There seemed to be a great stir about the house-door. Loud voices
were heard in gusts, and a sound like a woman's cry. The head
on the pillow was raised to listen.</p>

<p>"A murrain on those folk. There has been bungling among the pack-riders.
That new man Derek is an oaf of oafs."</p>

<p>She rang her silver bell sharply and waited on the ready footsteps.
But none came. There was silence now below, an ominous silence.</p>

<p>"God's curse upon this household," the woman cried. The monkey
whimpered again, and she took it by the scruff and tossed it to
the floor. "Peace, ape, or I will have you strangled. Bestir yourself,
father, and call Anton. There is a blight of deafness in this
place."</p>

<p>The room had suddenly lost its comfort and become cold and desolate.
The lamps were burning low and the coloured hangings were in deep
shadow. The storm was knocking fiercely at the lattice.</p>

<p>The monk rose with a shiver to do her bidding, but he was forestalled.
Steps sounded on the stairs and the steward entered. The woman
in the bed had opened her mouth to upbraid, when something in
his dim figure struck her silent.</p>

<p>The old man stumbled forward and fell on his knees beside her.</p>

<p>"Madam, dear madam," he stammered, "ill news has come to this
house.... There is a post in from Avesnes.... The young master..."</p>

<p>"Philip," and the woman's voice rose to a scream. "What of my
son?"</p>

<p>"The lord has taken away what He gave. He is dead, slain in a
scuffle with highway robbers.... Oh, the noble young lord! The
fair young knight! Woe upon this stricken house!"</p>

<p>The woman lay very still, white the old man on his knees drifted
into broken prayers. Then he observed her silence, scrambled to
his feet in a panic, and lit two candles from the nearest brazier.
She lay back on the pillows in a deathly faintness, her face drained
of blood. Only her tortured eyes showed that life was still in
her.</p>

<p>Her voice came at last, no louder than a whisper. It was soft
now, but more terrible than the old harshness.</p>

<p>"I follow Philip," it said. "<em>Sic transit gloria</em>....
Call me Arnulf the goldsmith and Robert the scrivener.... Quick,
man, quick. I have much to do ere I die."</p>

<p>As the steward hurried out, the Cluniac, remembering his office,
sought to offer comfort, but in his bland worldling's voice the
consolations sounded hollow. She lay motionless, while he quoted
the Scriptures. Encouraged by her docility, he spoke of the certain
reward promised by Heaven to the rich who remembered the Church
at their death. He touched upon the high duties of his Order and
the handicap of its poverty. He bade her remember her debt to
the Abbot of Cluny.</p>

<p>She seemed about to speak and he bent eagerly to catch her words.</p>

<p>"Peace, you babbler," she said. "I am done with your God. When
I meet Him I will outface Him. He has broken His compact and betrayed
me. My riches go to the Burgrave for the comfort of this city
where they were won. Let your broken rush of a Church wither and
rot!"</p>

<p>Scared out of all composure by this blasphemy, the Cluniac fell
to crossing himself and mumbling invocations. The diplomat had
vanished and only the frightened monk remained. He would fain
have left the room had he dared, but the spell of her masterful
spirit held him. After that she spoke nothing....</p>

<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>Again there was a noise on the stairs and she moved a little,
as if mustering her failing strength for the ultimate business.
But it was not Arnulf the gold smith. It was Anton, and he shook
like a man on his way to the gallows.</p>

<p>"Madam, dear madam," he stammered, again on his knees. "There
is another message. One has come from the Bredestreet with word
of your lady daughter. An hour ago she has borne a child...A lusty
son, madam."</p>

<p>The reply from the bed was laughter.</p>

<p>It began low and hoarse like a fit of coughing, and rose to the
high cackling mirth of extreme age. At the sound both Anton and
the monk took to praying. Presently it stopped, and her voice
came full and strong as it had been of old.</p>

<p>"<em>Mea culpa</em>," it said, "<em>mea maxima culpa</em>. I
judged the Sire God over hastily. He is merry and has wrought
a jest on me. He has kept His celestial promise in His own fashion.
He takes my brave Philip and gives me instead a suckling.... So
be it. The infant has my blood, and the race of Forester John
will not die. Arnulf will have an easy task. He need but set the
name of this new-born in Philip's place. What manner of child
is he, Anton? Lusty, you say, and well-formed? I would my arms
could have held him.... But I must be about my business of dying.
I will take the news to Philip."</p>
