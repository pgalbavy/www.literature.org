<P>The first moment of surprise over, D'Artagnan reperused
Athos's note. &quot;It is strange,&quot; said he, &quot;that the king
should send for me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why so?&quot; said Raoul; &quot;do you not think, monsieur, that the
king must regret such a servant as you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, oh!&quot; cried the officer, laughing with all his might;
&quot;you are poking fun at me, Master Raoul. If the king had
regretted me, he would not have let me leave him. No, no; I
see in it something better, or worse, if you like.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Worse! What can that be, monsieur le chevalier?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are young, you are a boy, you are admirable. Oh, how I
should like to be as you are! To be but twenty-four, with an
unfurrowed brow, under which the brain is void of everything
but women, love, and good intentions. Oh, Raoul, as long as
you have not received the smiles of kings, the confidence of
queens; as long as you have not had two cardinals killed
under you, the one a tiger, the other a fox, as long as you
have not  -  But what is the good of all this trifling? We
must part, Raoul.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How you say the word! What a serious face!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Eh! but the occasion is worthy of it. Listen to me. I have
a very good recommendation to tender you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am all attention, Monsieur d'Artagnan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will go and inform your father of my departure.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your departure?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pardieu! You will tell him that I am gone into England; and
that I am living in my little country-house.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In England, you!  -  And the king's orders?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You get more and more silly: do you imagine that I am going
to the Louvre, to place myself at the disposal of that
little crowned wolf-cub?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The king a wolf-cub? Why, monsieur le chevalier, you are
mad!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On the contrary, I never was so sane. You do not know what
he wants to do with me, this worthy son of Louis le Juste!
 -  But, Mordioux! that is policy. He wishes to ensconce me
snugly in the Bastile  -  purely and simply, look you!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What for?&quot; cried Raoul, terrified at what he heard.</P>
<P>&quot;On account of what I told him one day at Blois. I was warm;
he remembers it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You told him what?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That he was mean, cowardly, and silly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good God!&quot; cried Raoul, &quot;is it possible that such words
should have issued from your mouth?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps I don't give the letter of my speech, but I give
the sense of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But did not the king have you arrested immediately?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;By whom? It was I who commanded the musketeers; he must
have commanded me to convey myself to prison; I would never
have consented: I would have resisted myself. And then I
went into England  -  no more D'Artagnan. Now, the cardinal
is dead, or nearly so, they learn that I am in Paris, and
they lay their hands on me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The cardinal was your protector?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The cardinal knew me; he knew certain particularities of
me; I also knew some of his; we appreciated each other
mutually. And then, on rendering his soul to the devil, he
would recommend Anne of Austria to make me the inhabitant of
a safe place. Go then, and find your father, relate the fact
to him  -  and adieu!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My dear Monsieur d'Artagnan,&quot; said Raoul, very much
agitated, after having looked out at the window, &quot;you cannot
even fly!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because there is below an officer of the Swiss guards
waiting for you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, he will arrest you.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan broke into a Homeric laugh.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! I know very well that you will resist, that you will
fight, even; I know very well that you will prove the
conqueror; but that amounts to rebellion, and you are an
officer yourself, knowing what discipline is.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Devil of a boy, how logical that is!&quot; grumbled D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;You approve of it. do you not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, instead of passing into the street, where that idiot
is waiting for me, I will slip quietly out at the back. I
have a horse in the stable, and a good one. I will ride him
to death; my means permit me to do so, and by killing one
horse after another, I shall arrive at Boulogne in eleven
hours; I know the road. Only tell your father one thing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is  -  that the thing he knows about is placed at
Planchet's house, except a fifth, and that  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, my dear M. d'Artagnan, rest assured that if you fly,
two things will be said of you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What are they, my dear friend?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The first, that you have been afraid.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! and who will dare to say that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The king first.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well! but he will tell the truth,  -  I am afraid.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The second, that you knew yourself guilty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Guilty of what?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, of the crimes they wish to impute to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is true again. So, then, you advise me to go and get
myself made a prisoner in the Bastile?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;M. le Comte de la Fere would advise you just as I do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pardieu! I know he would,&quot; said D'Artagnan thoughtfully.
&quot;You are right, I shall not escape. But if they cast me into
the Bastile?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We will get you out again,&quot; said Raoul, with a quiet, calm
air.</P>
<P>&quot;Mordioux! You said that after a brave fashion, Raoul,&quot; said
D'Artagnan, seizing his hand, &quot;that savors of Athos,
distinctly. Well, I will go, then. Do not forget my last
word.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Except a fifth,&quot; said Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, you are a fine boy! and I wish you to add one thing to
that last word.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Speak, chevalier!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is that if you cannot get me out of the Bastile, and I
remain there  -  oh! that will be so, and I shall be a
detestable prisoner; I, who have been a passable man,  -  in
that case, I give three-fifths to you, and the fourth to
your father.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Chevalier!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mordioux! If you will have some masses said for me, you are
welcome.&quot;</P>
<P>That being said, D'Artagnan took his belt from the hook,
girded on his sword, took a hat the feather of which was
fresh, and held his hand out to Raoul, who threw himself
into his arms. When in the shop, he cast a quick glance at
the shop-lads, who looked upon the scene with a pride
mingled with some inquietude; then plunging his hands into a
chest of currants, he went straight to the officer who was
waiting for him at the door.</P>
<P>&quot;Those features! Can it be you, Monsieur de Friedisch?&quot;
cried D'Artagnan, gayly. &quot;Eh! eh! what, do we arrest our
friends?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Arrest!&quot; whispered the lads among themselves.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it is I, Monsieur d'Artagnan! Good-day to you!&quot; said
the Swiss, in his mountain patois.</P>
<P>&quot;Must I give you up my sword? I warn you, that it is long
and heavy; you had better let me wear it to the Louvre: I
feel quite lost in the streets without a sword, and you
would be more at a loss than I should, with two.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The king has given no orders about it,&quot; replied the Swiss,
&quot;so keep your sword.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, that is very polite on the part of the king. Let us
go, at once.&quot;</P>
<P>Monsieur Friedisch was not a talker, and D'Artagnan had too
many things to think about to say much. From Planchet's shop
to the Louvre was not far  -  they arrived in ten minutes. It
was a dark night. M. de Friedisch wanted to enter by the
wicket. &quot;No,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;you would lose time by that;
take the little staircase.&quot;</P>
<P>The Swiss did as D'Artagnan advised, and conducted him to
the vestibule of the king's cabinet. When arrived there, he
bowed to his prisoner, and, without saying anything,
returned to his post. D'Artagnan had not had time to ask why
his sword was not taken from him, when the door of the
cabinet opened, and a valet de chambre called &quot;M.
D'Artagnan!&quot; The musketeer assumed his parade carriage and
entered, with his large eyes wide open, his brow calm, his
mustache stiff. The king was seated at a table writing. He
did not disturb himself when the step of the musketeer
resounded on the floor; he did not even turn his head.
D'Artagnan advanced as far as the middle of the room, and
seeing that the king paid no attention to him, and
suspecting, besides, that this was nothing but affectation,
a sort of tormenting preamble to the explanation that was
preparing, he turned his back on the prince, and began to
examine the frescoes on the cornices, and the cracks in the
ceiling. This maneuver was accompanied by a little tacit
monologue. &quot;Ah! you want to humble me, do you?  -  you, whom
I have seen so young  -  you, whom I have served as I would
my own child,  -  you, whom I have served as I would a God  - 
that is to say, for nothing. Wait awhile! wait awhile! you
shall see what a man can do who has snuffed the air of the
fire of the Huguenots, under the beard of monsieur le
cardinal  -  the true cardinal.&quot; At this moment Louis turned
round.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! are you there, Monsieur d'Artagnan?&quot; said he.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan saw the movement and imitated it. &quot;Yes, sire,&quot;
said he.</P>
<P>&quot;Very well; have the goodness to wait till I have cast this
up.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan made no reply; he only bowed. &quot;That is polite
enough,&quot; thought he; &quot;I have nothing to say.&quot;</P>
<P>Louis made a violent dash with his pen, and threw it angrily
away.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! go on, work yourself up!&quot; thought the musketeer; &quot;you
will put me at my ease. You shall find I did not empty the
bag, the other day, at Blois.&quot;</P>
<P>Louis rose from his seat, passed his hand over his brow,
then, stopping opposite to D'Artagnan, he looked at him with
an air at once imperious and kind. &quot;What the devil does he
want with me? I wish he would begin!&quot; thought the musketeer.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said the king, &quot;you know, without doubt, that
monsieur le cardinal is dead?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I suspected so, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know that, consequently, I am master in my own
kingdom?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is not a thing that dates from the death of monsieur
le cardinal, sire; a man is always master in his own house,
when he wishes to be so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; but do you remember all you said to me at Blois?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now we come to it,&quot; thought D'Artagnan, &quot;I was not
deceived. Well, so much the better, it is a sign that my
scent is tolerably keen yet.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You do not answer me,&quot; said Louis.</P>
<P>&quot;Sire, I think I recollect.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You only think?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is so long ago.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you do not remember, I do. You said to me,  -  listen
with attention.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! I shall listen with all my ears, sire; for it is very
likely the conversation will turn in a fashion very
interesting to me.&quot;</P>
<P>Louis once more looked at the musketeer, The latter smoothed
the feather of his hat, then his mustache, and waited
bravely. Louis XIV. continued: &quot;You quitted my service,
monsieur, after having told me the whole truth?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is, after having declared to me all you thought to be
true, with regard to my mode of thinking and acting. That is
always a merit. You began by telling me that you had served
my family thirty years, and were fatigued.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I said so; yes, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you afterwards admitted that that fatigue was a
pretext, and that discontent was the real cause.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I was discontented, in fact, but that discontent has never
betrayed itself, that I know of, and if, like a man of
heart, I have spoken out before your majesty, I have not
even thought of the matter, before anybody else.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do not excuse yourself, D'Artagnan, but continue to listen
to me. When making me the reproach that you were
discontented, you received in reply a promise:  -  `Wait.'  - 
Is not that true?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire, as true as what I told you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You answered me, `Hereafter! No, now, immediately.' Do not
excuse yourself, I tell you. It was natural, but you had no
charity for your poor prince, Monsieur d'Artagnan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire! charity for a king, on the part of a poor soldier!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You understand me very well; you knew that I stood in need
of it; you knew very well that I was not master; you knew
very well that my hope was in the future. Now, you answered
me when I spoke of that future, `My discharge,  -  and that
directly.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is true,&quot; murmured D'Artagnan, biting his mustache.</P>
<P>&quot;You did not flatter me when I was in distress,&quot; added
Louis.</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; said D'Artagnan, raising his head nobly, &quot;if I did
not flatter your majesty when poor, neither did I betray
you. I have shed my blood for nothing; I have watched like a
dog at a door, knowing full well that neither bread nor bone
would be thrown to me. I, although poor likewise, asked
nothing of your majesty but the discharge you speak of.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know you are a brave man, but I was a young man, and you
ought to have had some indulgence for me. What had you to
reproach the king with?  -  that he left King Charles II.
without assistance?  -  let us say further  -  that he did not
marry Mademoiselle de Mancini?&quot; When saying these words, the
king fixed upon the musketeer a searching look.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! ah!&quot; thought the latter, &quot;he is doing far more than
remembering, he divines. The devil!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your sentence,&quot; continued Louis, &quot;fell upon the king and
fell upon the man. But, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that weakness,
for you considered it a weakness?&quot;  -  D'Artagnan made no
reply  -  &quot;you reproached me also with regard to monsieur,
the defunct cardinal. Now, monsieur le cardinal, did he not
bring me up, did he not support me?  -  elevating himself and
supporting himself at the same time, I admit; but the
benefit was discharged. As an ingrate or an egotist, would
you, then, have better loved or served me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We will say no more about it, monsieur; it would only
create in you too many regrets, and me too much pain.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan was not convinced. The young king, in adopting a
tone of hauteur with him, did not forward his purpose.</P>
<P>&quot;You have since reflected?&quot; resumed Louis.</P>
<P>&quot;Upon what, sire?&quot; asked D'Artagnan, politely.</P>
<P>&quot;Why, upon all that I have said to you, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire, no doubt  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you have only waited for an opportunity of retracting
your words?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You hesitate, it seems.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not understand what your majesty did me the honor to
say to me.&quot;</P>
<P>Louis's brow became cloudy.</P>
<P>&quot;Have the goodness to excuse me, sire; my understanding is
particularly thick; things do not penetrate it without
difficulty; but it is true, when once they get in, they
remain there.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes; you appear to have a memory.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Almost as good a one as your majesty's.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then give me quickly one solution. My time is valuable.
What have you been doing since your discharge?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Making my fortune, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The expression is crude, Monsieur d'Artagnan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your majesty takes it in bad part, certainly. I entertain
nothing but the profoundest respect for the king; and if I
have been impolite, which might be excused by my long
sojourn in camps and barracks, your majesty is too much
above me to be offended at a word that innocently escapes
from a soldier.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In fact, I know you performed a brilliant action in
England, monsieur. I only regret that you have broken your
promise.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I!&quot; cried D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Doubtless. You engaged your word not to serve any other
prince on quitting my service. Now it was for King Charles
II. that you undertook the marvelous carrying off of M.
Monk.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pardon me, sire, it was for myself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And did you succeed?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Like the captains of the fifteenth century, coups-de-main
and adventures.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you call succeeding?  -  a fortune?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A hundred thousand crowns, sire, which I now possess  - 
that is, in one week three times as much money as I ever had
in fifty years.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is a handsome sum. But you are ambitious, I perceive.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I, sire? The quarter of that would be a treasure; and I
swear to you I have no thought of augmenting it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What! you contemplate remaining idle?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You mean to drop the sword?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That I have already done.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Impossible, Monsieur d'Artagnan,&quot; said Louis, firmly.</P>
<P>&quot;But, sire  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And why, sire?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because it is my wish you should not!&quot; said the young
prince, in a voice so stern and imperious that D'Artagnan
evinced surprise and even uneasiness.</P>
<P>&quot;Will your majesty allow me one word of reply?&quot; said he.</P>
<P>&quot;Speak.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I formed that resolution when I was poor and destitute.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So be it. Go on.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now, when by my energy I have acquired a comfortable means
of subsistence, would your majesty despoil me of my liberty?
Your majesty would condemn me to the lowest, when I have
gained the highest?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who gave you permission, monsieur to fathom my designs, or
to reckon with me?&quot; replied Louis, in a voice almost angry;
&quot;who told you what I shall do or what you will yourself do?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire,&quot; said the musketeer, quietly, &quot;as far as I see,
freedom is not the order of the conversation, as it was on
the day we came to an explanation at Blois.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, monsieur; everything is changed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I tender your majesty my sincere compliments upon that, but
 -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But you don't believe it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am not a great statesman, and yet I have my eye upon
affairs; it seldom fails; now, I do not see exactly as your
majesty does, sire. The reign of Mazarin is over, but that
of the financiers is begun. They have the money; your
majesty will not often see much of it. To live under the paw
of these hungry wolves is hard for a man who reckoned upon
independence.&quot;</P>
<P>At this moment some one scratched at the door of the
cabinet; the king raised his head proudly. &quot;Your pardon,
Monsieur d'Artagnan,&quot; said he; &quot;it is M. Colbert, who comes
to make me a report. Come in M. Colbert.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan drew back. Colbert entered with papers in his
hand, and went up to the king. There can be little doubt
that the Gascon did not lose the opportunity of applying his
keen, quick glance to the new figure which presented itself.</P>
<P>&quot;Is the inquiry made?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And the opinion of the inquisitors?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is that the accused merit confiscation and death.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! ah!&quot; said the king, without changing countenance, and
casting an oblique look at D'Artagnan. &quot;And your own
opinion, M. Colbert?&quot; said he.</P>
<P>Colbert looked at D'Artagnan in his turn. That imposing
countenance checked the words upon his lips. Louis perceived
this. &quot;Do not disturb yourself,&quot; said he; &quot;it is M.
d'Artagnan,  -  do you not know M. d'Artagnan again?&quot;</P>
<P>These two men looked at each other  -  D'Artagnan, with eyes
open and bright as the day  -  Colbert, with his half closed,
and dim. The frank intrepidity of the one annoyed the other;
the circumspection of the financier disgusted the soldier.
&quot;Ah! ah! this is the gentleman who made that brilliant
stroke in England,&quot; said Colbert. And he bowed slightly to
D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! ah!&quot; said the Gascon, &quot;this is the gentleman who
clipped off the lace from the uniform of the Swiss! A
praiseworthy piece of economy.&quot;</P>
<P>The financier thought to pierce the musketeer; but the
musketeer ran the financier through.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan,&quot; resumed the king, who had not
remarked all the shades of which Mazarin would have missed
not one, &quot;this concerns the farmers of the revenue who have
robbed me, whom I am hanging, and whose death-warrants I am
about to sign.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! oh!&quot; said D'Artagnan, starting.</P>
<P>&quot;What did you say?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! nothing, sire. This is no business of mine.&quot;</P>
<P>The king had already taken up the pen, and was applying it
to the paper. &quot;Sire,&quot; said Colbert in a subdued voice, &quot;I
beg to warn your majesty, that if an example be necessary,
there will be difficulty in the execution of your orders.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you say?&quot; said Louis.</P>
<P>&quot;You must not conceal from yourself,&quot; continued Colbert
quietly, &quot;that attacking the farmers-general is attacking
the superintendence. The two unfortunate guilty men in
question are the particular friends of a powerful personage,
and the punishment, which otherwise might be comfortably
confined to the Chatelet will doubtless be a signal for
disturbances!&quot;</P>
<P>Louis colored and turned towards D'Artagnan, who took a
slight bite at his mustache, not without a smile of pity for
the financier, and for the king who had to listen to him so
long. But Louis seized the pen, and with a movement so
rapid, that his hand shook, he affixed his signature at the
bottom of the two papers presented by Colbert,  -  then
looking the latter in the face,  -  &quot;Monsieur Colbert'&quot; said
he, &quot;when you speak to me on business, exclude more
frequently the word difficulty from your reasonings and
opinions; as to the word impossibility, never pronounce it.&quot;</P>
<P>Colbert bowed, much humiliated at having to undergo such a
lesson before the musketeer; he was about to go out, but,
jealous to repair his check: &quot;I forgot to announce to your
majesty,&quot; said he, &quot;that the confiscations amount to the sum
of five millions of livres.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's pretty well!&quot; thought D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Which makes in my coffers?&quot; said the king.</P>
<P>&quot;Eighteen millions of livres, sire,&quot; replied Colbert,
bowing.</P>
<P>&quot;Mordioux!&quot; growled D'Artagnan, &quot;that's glorious!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur Colbert,&quot; added the king, &quot;you will, if you
please, go through the gallery where M. Lyonne is waiting,
and will tell him to bring hither what he has drawn up  -  by
my order.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Directly, sire; if your majesty wants me no more this
evening?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, monsieur: good-night!&quot; And Colbert went out.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, let us return to our affair, M. d'Artagnan,&quot; said the
king, as if nothing had happened. &quot;You see that, with
respect to money, there is already a notable change.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Something to the tune of from zero to eighteen millions,&quot;
replied the musketeer, gayly. &quot;Ah! that was what your
majesty wanted the day King Charles II. came to Blois. The
two states would not have been embroiled to-day; for I must
say, that there also I see another stumbling-block.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, in the first place,&quot; replied Louis, &quot;you are unjust,
monsieur; for, if Providence had made me able to give my
brother the million that day, you would not have quitted my
service, and, consequently, you would not have made your
fortune, as you told me just now you have done. But, in
addition to this, I have had another piece of good fortune;
and my difference with Great Britain need not alarm you.&quot;</P>
<P>A valet de chambre interrupted the king by announcing M.
Lyonne. &quot;Come in, monsieur,&quot; said the king; &quot;you are
punctual; that is like a good servant. Let us see your
letter to my brother Charles II.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan pricked up his ears. &quot;A moment, monsieur,&quot; said
Louis, carelessly to the Gascon, &quot;I must expedite to London
my consent to the marriage of my brother, M. le Duc d'Anjou,
with the Princess Henrietta Stuart.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He is knocking me about, it seems,&quot; murmured D'Artagnan,
whilst the king signed the letter, and dismissed M. de
Lyonne, &quot;but, ma foi! the more he knocks me about in this
manner, the better I like it.&quot;</P>
<P>The king followed M. de Lyonne with his eyes, till the door
was closed behind him; he even made three steps, as if he
would follow the minister, but, after these three steps,
stopping, pausing, and coming back to the musketeer,  - 
&quot;Now, monsieur,&quot; said he, &quot;let us hasten to terminate our
affair. You told me the other day, at Blois, that you were
not rich?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I am now, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but that does not concern me; you have your own money,
not mine; that does not enter into my account.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not well understand what your majesty means.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then, instead of leaving you to draw out words, speak,
spontaneously. Should you be satisfied with twenty thousand
livres a year as a fixed income?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, sire,&quot; said D'Artagnan, opening his eyes to the
utmost.</P>
<P>&quot;Would you be satisfied with four horses furnished and kept,
and with a supplement of funds such as you might require,
according to occasions and needs, or would you prefer a
fixed sum which would be, for example, forty thousand
livres? Answer.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire, your majesty  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, you are surprised; that is natural, and I expected it.
Answer me, come! or I shall think you have no longer that
rapidity of judgment I have so much admired in you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is certain, sire, that twenty thousand livres a year
make a handsome sum; but  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No buts! Yes or no, is it an honorable indemnity?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! very certainly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will be satisfied with it? That is well. It will be
better to reckon the extra expenses separately; you can
arrange that with Colbert. Now let us pass to something more
important.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, sire, I told your majesty  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That you wanted rest, I know you did: only I replied that I
would not allow it  -  I am master, I suppose?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is well. You were formerly in the way of becoming
captain of the musketeers?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, here is your commission signed. I place it in this
drawer. The day on which you shall return from a certain
expedition which I have to confide to you, on that day you
may yourself take the commission from the drawer.&quot;
D'Artagnan still hesitated, and hung down his head. &quot;Come,
monsieur,&quot; said the king, &quot;one would believe, to look at
you, that you did not know that at the court of the most
Christian king, the captain-general of the musketeers takes
precedence of the marechals of France.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire, I know he does.</P>
<P>&quot;Then, am I to think you do put no faith in my word?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! sire, never  -  never dream of such a thing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have wished to prove to you, that you, so good a servant,
had lost a good master; am I anything like the master that
will suit you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I begin to think you are, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then, monsieur, you will resume your functions. Your
company is quite disorganized since your departure and the
men go about drinking and rioting in the cabarets where they
fight, in spite of my edicts, and those of my father. You
will reorganize the service as soon as possible.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will not again quit my person.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, sire,&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will march with me to the army, you will encamp round
my tent.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then, sire,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;if it is only to impose upon
me a service like that, your majesty need not give me twenty
thousand livres a year. I shall not earn them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I desire that you shall keep open house; I desire that you
should keep a liberal table; I desire that my captain of
musketeers should be a personage.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And I,&quot; said D'Artagnan, bluntly; &quot;I do not like easily
found money; I like money won! Your majesty gives me an idle
trade, which the first comer would perform for four thousand
livres.&quot;</P>
<P>Louis XIV. began to laugh. &quot;You are a true Gascon, Monsieur
d'Artagnan; you will draw my heart's secret from me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bah! has your majesty a secret, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well! then I accept the twenty thousand livres, for I will
keep that secret, and discretion is above all price, in
these times. Will your majesty speak now?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Boot yourself, Monsieur d'Artagnan, and to horse!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Directly, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Within two days.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is well, sire: for I have my affairs to settle before
I set out; particularly if it is likely there should be any
blows stirring.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That may happen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We can receive them! But, sire, you have addressed yourself
to avarice, to ambition; you have addressed yourself to the
heart of M. d'Artagnan, but you have forgotten one thing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You have said nothing to his vanity, when shall I be a
knight of the king's orders?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Does that interest you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, yes, sire. My friend Athos is quite covered with
orders, and that dazzles me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You shall be a knight of my order a month after you have
taken your commission of captain.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! ah!&quot; said the officer, thoughtfully, &quot;after the
expedition.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Precisely.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where is your majesty going to send me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you&quot;acquainted with Bretagne?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you any friends there?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In Bretagne? No, ma foi!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So much the better. Do you know anything about
fortifications?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I believe I do, sire,&quot; said D'Artagnan, smiling.</P>
<P>&quot;That is to say you can readily distinguish a fortress from
a simple fortification, such as is allowed to chatelains or
vassals?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I distinguish a fort from a rampart as I distinguish a
cuirass from a raised pie-crust, sire. Is that sufficient?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur. You will set out then.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For Bretagne?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alone?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Absolutely alone. That is to say, you must not even take a
lackey with you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;May I ask your majesty for what reason?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because, monsieur, it will be necessary to disguise
yourself sometimes, as the servant of a good family. Your
face is very well known in France, M. d'Artagnan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And then, sire?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And then you will travel slowly through Bretagne, and will
examine carefully the fortifications of that country.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The coasts?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, and the isles, commencing by Belle-Isle-en-Mer.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! which belongs to M. Fouquet!&quot; said D'Artagnan, in a
serious tone, raising his intelligent eye to Louis XIV.</P>
<P>&quot;I fancy you are right, monsieur, and that Belle-Isle does
belong to M. Fouquet, in fact.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then your majesty wishes me to ascertain if Belle-Isle is a
strong place?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If the fortifications of it are new or old?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Precisely.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And if the vassals of M. Fouquet are sufficiently numerous
to form a garrison?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is what I want to know; you have placed your finger on
the question.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And if they are not fortifying, sire?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will travel about Bretagne, listening and judging.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then I am a king's spy?&quot; said D'Artagnan, bluntly, twisting
his mustache.</P>
<P>&quot;No, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your pardon, sire; I spy on your majesty's account.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You start on a voyage of discovery, monsieur. Would you
march at the head of your musketeers, with your sword in
your hand, to observe any spot whatever, or an enemy's
position?&quot;</P>
<P>At this word D'Artagnan started.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you,&quot; continued the king, &quot;imagine yourself to be a
spy?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no,&quot; said D'Artagnan, but pensively; &quot;the thing changes
its face when one observes an enemy; one is but a soldier.
And if they are fortifying Belle-Isle?&quot; added he, quickly.</P>
<P>&quot;You will take an exact plan of the fortifications.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Will they permit me to enter?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That does not concern me; that is your affair. Did you not
understand that I reserved for you a supplement of twenty
thousand livres per annum, if you wished it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire; but if they are not fortifying?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will return quietly, without fatiguing your horse.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire, I am ready.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will begin to-morrow by going to monsieur le
surintendant's to take the first quarter of the pension I
give you. Do you know M. Fouquet?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very little, sire; but I beg your majesty to observe that I
don't think it immediately necessary that I should know
him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your pardon, monsieur; for he will refuse you the money I
wish you to take; and it is that refusal I look for.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; said D'Artagnan. &quot;Then, sire?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The money being refused, you will go and seek it at M.
Colbert's. A propos, have you a good horse?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;An excellent one, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How much did it cost you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A hundred and fifty pistoles.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will buy it of you. Here is a note for two hundred
pistoles.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I want my horse for my journey, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, and you take mine from me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not at all. On the contrary, I give it you. Only as it is
now mine and not yours, I am sure you will not spare it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your majesty is in a hurry, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A great hurry.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then what compels me to wait two days?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Reasons known to myself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's a different affair. The horse may make up the two
days, in the eight he has to travel; and then there is the
post.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no, the post compromises, Monsieur d'Artagnan. Begone
and do not forget you are my servant.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire, it is not my duty to forget it! At what hour
to-morrow shall I take my leave of your majesty?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where do you lodge?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I must henceforward lodge at the Louvre.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That must not be now  -  keep your lodgings in the city: I
will pay for them. As to your departure, it must take place
at night; you must set out without being seen by any one,
or, if you are seen, it must not be known that you belong to
me. Keep your mouth shut, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your majesty spoils all you have said by that single word.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I asked you where you lodged, for I cannot always send to
M. le Comte de la Fere to seek you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I lodge with M. Planchet, a grocer, Rue des Lombards, at
the sign of the Pilon d'Or.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go out but little, show yourself less, and await my
orders.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And yet, sire, I must go for the money.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is true, but when going to the superintendence, where
so many people are constantly going, you must mingle with
the crowd.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I want the notes, sire, for the money.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Here they are.&quot; The king signed them, and D'Artagnan looked
on, to assure himself of their regularity.</P>
<P>&quot;Adieu! Monsieur d'Artagnan,&quot; added the king; &quot;I think you
have perfectly understood me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I? I understand that your majesty sends me to
Belle-Isle-en-Mer, that is all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To learn?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To learn how M. Fouquet's works are going on; that is all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well: I admit you may be taken.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And I do not admit it,&quot; replied the Gascon, boldly.</P>
<P>&quot;I admit you may be killed,&quot; continued the king.</P>
<P>&quot;That is not probable, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In the first case, you must not speak; in the second there
must be no papers found upon you.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan shrugged his shoulders without ceremony, and took
leave of the king, saying to himself:  -  &quot;The English shower
continues  -  let us remain under the spout!&quot;</P></article>
