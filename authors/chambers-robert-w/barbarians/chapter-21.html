<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A week later, toward noon, as usual, the two American, muleteers,
Smith and Glenn, sauntered over from their corral to the White
Doe Tavern where, it being a meatless day, they ate largely of
potato soup and of a tench, smoking hot.</p>

<p>The tench had been caught that morning off the back doorstep,
which was an ancient and mossy slab of limestone let into the
coping of the river wall.</p>

<p>Jean Courtray, the crippled inn-keeper, caught it. All that morning
he had sat there in the sun on the river wall, half dozing, opening
his dim eyes at intervals to gaze at his painted quill afloat
among the water weeds of the little river Lesse. At intervals,
too, he turned his head with that peculiar movement of the old,
and peered at his daughter, Maryette, and the Belgian gardener
who were working among the potatoes in the garden.</p>

<p>And at last he had hooked his fish and the emaciated young Belgian
dropped his hoe and came over and released it from the hook where
it lay flopping and quivering and glittering among the wild grasses
on the river bank. And that was how Kid Glenn and Sticky Smith,
American muleteers on duty at Saint Lesse, came to lunch on freshly
caught tench at the Inn of the White Doe.</p>

<p>After luncheon, agreeably satiated, they rose from the table
in the little dining room and strolled out to the garden in the
rear of the inn, their Mexican spurs clanking. Maryette heard
them; they tipped their caps to her; she acknowledged their salute
gravely and continued to cultivate her garden with a hoe, the
blond, consumptive Belgian trundling a rickety cultivator at her
heels.</p>

<p>"Look, Stick," drawled Glenn. "Maryette’s got her decoration
on."</p>

<p>From where they lounged by the river wall they could see the
cross of the Legion pinned to the girl’s blouse.</p>

<p>Both muleteers had been present at the investment the day before,
when a general officer arrived from Paris and the entire garrison
of Sainte Lesse had been paraded&mdash;an impressive total of three
dozen men&mdash;six gendarmes and a brigadier; one remount sub-lieutenant
and twenty troopers; a veterinary, two white American muleteers,
and five American negro hostlers from Baton Rouge.</p>

<p>The girl had nearly died of shyness during the ceremony, had
endured the accolade with crimson cheeks, had stammered a whispered
response to the congratulations of neighbors who had gathered
to see the little bell-mistress of Sainte Lesse honoured by the
country which she had served in the belfry of Nivelle.</p>

<p>As she came past Smith and Glenn, trailing her hoe, the latter
now sufficiently proficient in French, said gaily:</p>

<p>"Have you heard from Jack again, Mamzelle Maryette?"</p>

<p>The girl blushed:</p>

<p>"I hear from Djack by every mail," she said, with all the transparent
honesty that characterized her.</p>

<p>Smith grinned:</p>

<p>"Just like that! Well, tell him from me to quit fooling away
his time in a hospital and come and get you or somebody is going
to steal you."</p>

<p>The girl was very happy; she stood there in the September sunshine
leaning on her hoe and gazing half shyly, half humorously down
the river where a string of American mules was being watered.</p>

<p>Mellow Ethiopian laughter sounded from the distance as the Baton
Rouge negroes exchanged pleasantries in limited French with a
couple of gendarmes on the bank above them. And there, in the
sunshine of the little garden by the river, war and death seemed
very far away. Only at intervals the veering breeze brought to
Sainte Lesse the immense vibration of the cannonade; only at intervals
the high sky-clatter of an airplane reminded the village that
the front was only a little north of Nivelle, and that what had
been Nivelle was not so very far away.</p>

<p>"If you were <em>my</em> girl, Maryette," remarked Smith, "I’d
die of worry in that hospital."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> might have reason to, Monsieur," retorted the girl
demurely. "But you see it’s Djack who is convalescing, not you."</p>

<p>She had become accustomed to the ceaseless banter of Burley’s
two comrades&mdash;a banter entirely American, and which at first she
was unable to understand. But now all things American, including
accent and odd, perverted humour, had become very dear to her.
The clink-clank of the muleteer’s big spurs always set her heart
beating; the sight of an arriving convoy from the Channel port
thrilled her, and to her the trample of mules, the shouts of foreign
negroes, the drawling, broken French spoken by the white muleteers
made heavenly real to her the dream which love had so suddenly
invaded, and into which, as suddenly, strode Death, clutching
at Love.</p>

<p>She had beaten him off&mdash;she had&mdash;or God had&mdash;routed Death, driven
him from the dream. For it was a dream to her still, and she thought
she could never be able to comprehend the magic reality of it,
even when at last her man, "Djack," came back to prove the blessed
miracle which held her in the magic of its thrall.</p>

<p>"Who’s the guy with the wheelbarrow?" inquired Sticky Smith,
rolling a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Karl, his name is," she answered; "&mdash;a Belgian refugee."</p>

<p>"He looks like a Hun to me," remarked Glenn, bluntly.</p>

<p>"He has his papers," said the girl.</p>

<p>Glenn shrugged.</p>

<p>"With his little pink eyes of a pig and his whitish hair and
eyebrows&mdash;well, maybe they make ’em like that in Belgium."</p>

<p>"Papers," added Smith, "<em>can</em> be swiped."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head:</p>

<p>"He’s an invalid student from Ypres. He looks quite ill, I think."</p>

<p>"He looks the lunger, all right. But Huns have it, too. What
does he do&mdash;wander about town at will?"</p>

<p>"He works for us, monsieur. Your suspicions are harsh. Karl is
quite harmless, poor boy."</p>

<p>"What does he do after hours?" demanded Sticky Smith, watching
the manœuvres of the sickly blond youth and the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Smith, if you knew how innocent is his pastime!" she
exclaimed, laughing. "He collects and studies moths and butterflies.
Is there, if you please, a mania more harmless in the world?...
And now I must return to my work, messieurs."</p>

<p>As the two muleteers strode clanking away toward the canal in
the meadow, the blond youth turned his head and looked after them
out of eyes which were naturally pale and small, and which, as
he watched the two Americans, seemed to grow paler and smaller
yet.</p>

<p>That afternoon old Courtray, swathed in a shawl, sat on the mossy
doorstep and fished among the water weeds of the river. The sun
was low; work in the garden had ended.</p>

<p>Maryette had gone up into her belfry to play the sunset hymn
on the noble old carillon. Through the sunset sky the lovely bell-notes
floated far and wide, exquisitely chaste and aloof as the high-showering
ecstasy of a skylark.</p>

<p>As always the little village looked upward and listened, pausing
in its humble duties as long as their little bell-mistress remained
in her tower.</p>

<p>After the hymn she played "Myn hart is vol verlangen" and "Het
Lied der Vlamingen," and ended with the delicate, bewitching little
folk-song, "Myn Vryer," by Hasselt.</p>

<p>Then in the red glow of the setting sun the girl laid aside her
wooden gloves, rose from the ancient keyboard, wound up the drum,
and, her duty done for the evening, came down out of the tower
among the transparent evening shadows of the tree-lined village
street.</p>

<p>The sun hung over Nivelle hills, which had turned to amethyst.
Sunbeams laced the little river in a red net through which old
Courtray’s quill stemmed the ripples. He still clutched his fishing
pole, but his eyes were closed, his chin resting on his chest.</p>

<p>Maryette came silently into the garden and looked at her father&mdash;looked
at the blond Karl seated on the river wall beside the dozing angler.
The blond youth had a box on his knees into which he was intently
peering.</p>

<p>The girl came to the river wall and seated herself at her father’s
feet. The Belgian refugee student had already risen to attention,
his heels together, but Maryette signed him to be seated again.</p>

<p>"What have you found now, Karl?" she inquired in a cautiously
modulated voice.</p>

<p>"Ah, mademoiselle, fancy! I haff by chance with my cultivator
among your potatoes already twenty pupæ of the magnificent moth,
Sphinx Atropos, upturned! See! Regard them, mademoiselle! What
lucky chance! What fortune for me, an entomologist, this wonderful
sphinx moth to discover encased within its chrysalis!"</p>

<p>The girl smiled at his enthusiasm:</p>

<p>"But, Karl, those funny, smooth brown things which resemble little
polished evergreen-cones are not rare in my garden. Often, when
spading or hoeing among the potato vines, I uncover them."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, the caterpillar which makes this chrysalis feeds
by night on the leaves of the potato, and, when ready to transform,
burrows into the earth to become a chrysalis or pupa, as we call
it. That iss why mademoiselle has often disinterred the pupæ of
this largest and strangest of our native sphinx-moths."</p>

<p>Maryette leaned over and looked into the wooden box, where lay
the chrysalides.</p>

<p>"What kind of moth do they make?" she asked.</p>

<p>He blinked his small, pale eyes:</p>

<p>"The Death’s Head," he said, complacently.</p>

<p>The girl recoiled involuntarily:</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed under her breath, "&mdash;<em>that</em> creature!"</p>

<p>For everywhere in France the great moth, with its strange and
ominous markings, is perfectly well known. To the superstitious
it is a creature of evil omen in its fulvous, black and lead-coloured
livery of death. For the broad, furry thorax bears a skull, and
the big, mousy body the yellow ribs of a skeleton.</p>

<p>Measuring often more than five inches across the expanded wings,
its formidable size alone might be sufficient to inspire alarm,
but in addition it possesses a horrid attribute unknown among
other moths and butterflies; it can utter a cry&mdash;a tiny shrill,
shuddering complaint. Small wonder, perhaps, that the peasant
holds it in horror&mdash;this sleek, furry, powerfully winged creature
marked with skull and bones, which whirrs through the night and
comes thudding against the window, and shrieks horridly when touched
by a human hand.</p>

<p>"So <em>that</em> is what turns into the Death’s Head moth,"
said the girl in a low voice as though to herself. "I never knew
it. I thought those things were legless cock-chafers when I dug
them out of potato hills. Karl, why do you keep them?"</p>

<p>"Ah, mademoiselle! To study them. To breed from them the moth.
The Death’s Head is magnificent."</p>

<p>"God made it," admitted the girl with a faint shudder, "but I
am afraid I could not love it. When do they hatch out?"</p>

<p>"It is time now. It is not like others of the sphinx family.
Incubation requires but a few weeks. These are nearly ready to
emerge, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Oh. And then what do they do?"</p>

<p>"They mate."</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"The males seek the females," he said in his pedantic, monotonous
voice. "And so ardent are the lovers that although there be no
female moth within five, eight, perhaps ten miles, yet will her
lover surely search through the night for her and find her."</p>

<p>Maryette shuddered again in spite of herself. The thought of
this creature marked with the emblems of death and possessed of
ardour, too, was distasteful.</p>

<p>"Amour macabre&mdash;what an unpleasant thought, Karl. I do not care
for your Death’s Head and for the history of their amours."</p>

<p>She turned and gently laid her head on her father’s knees. The
young man regarded her with a pallid sneer.</p>

<p>Addressing her back, still holding his boxful of pupæ on his
bony knees, he said with the sneer quite audible in his voice:</p>

<p>"Your famous savant, Fabre, first inspired me to study the sex
habits of the Death’s Head."</p>

<p>She made no reply, her cheek resting on her father’s knees.</p>

<p>"It was because of his wonderful experiments with the Great Peacock
moth and with others of the genus that I have studied to acquaint
myself concerning the amours of the Death’s Head. <em>And I have
discovered that he will find the female even if she be miles and
miles away.</em>"</p>

<p>The man was grinning now in the dusk&mdash;grinning like a skull;
but the girl’s back was still turned and she merely found something
in his voice not quite agreeable.</p>

<p>"I think," she said in a low, quiet voice, "that I have now heard
sufficient about the Death’s Head moth."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;have I offended mademoiselle? I ask a thousand pardons&#11834;"</p>

<p>Old Courtray awoke in the dusk.</p>

<p>"My quill, Maryette," he muttered, "&mdash;see if it floats yet?"</p>

<p>The girl bent over the water and strained her eyes. Her father
tested the line with shaky hands. There was no fish on the hook.</p>

<p>"<em>Voyons!</em> The <em>asticot</em> also is gone. Some robber
fish has been nibbling!" exclaimed the girl cheerfully, reeling
in the line. "Father, one cannot fish and doze at the same time."</p>

<p>"Eternal vigilance is the price of success&mdash;in peace as well
as in war," said Karl, the student, as he aided Maryette to raise
her father from the chair.</p>

<p>"Vigilance," repeated the girl. "Yes, always now in France. Because
always the enemy is listening." ... Her strong young arm around
her father, she traversed the garden slowly toward the house.
A pleasant odour came from the kitchen of the White Doe, where
an old peasant woman was cooking.</p>
