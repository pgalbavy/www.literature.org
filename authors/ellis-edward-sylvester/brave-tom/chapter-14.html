<p>Such a bleak and piercing wind swept across the deck of the Simoon
that Jim Travers was glad to spend most of his time in the cabin,
where a warm fire was always going.</p>

<p>The first day out the boy succeeded in picking up a few scraps
of knowledge, which served rather to deepen than to clear up the
mystery of his abduction.</p>

<p>The schooner was a good sailer, and was well furnished with coal,
wood, water, and provisions, as if she were intended for a long
voyage. There was no real cargo, as he could see; and the two
men who managed the craft did not drop a word which could give
any clew as to their destination.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be said that they treated the boy well or ill.
Their conduct was more of the character of indifference, since
they paid not the least attention to him, further than to notify
him to keep out of their way.</p>

<p>This indifference might be considered kindness, inasmuch as it
relieved the boy from attempting work which would have proven
of a perilous nature. This also relieved him in a great measure
of the fear which made existence a burden during the first twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>On the third morning out from New York, Jim made the discovery
that the rising sun was on his right, from which it was certain
he was sailing toward the north. Other evidence led him to conclude,
from his knowledge of geography, that they had entered Delaware
Bay, and were approaching Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"It's a queer way of getting back home again," was the reflection
of the boy when convinced of the fact.</p>

<p>However, the Simoon did not propose to visit the Quaker City
just then, and she came to anchor in a broad part of the bay,
fully a half-mile from shore.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon that this stop was made; and just
as night was closing in, a small boat containing two persons was
discerned rowing out from land. When they were nigh enough to
board the schooner, Jim saw that one was Mr. Hornblower, and the
other was a herculean negro, who was swaying the oars with the
ease of a professional.</p>

<p>As both came on deck, the white man signified to the lad that
he was to follow him into the cabin, where the door was shut,
and they sat down facing each other.</p>

<p>"I might as well own that I deceived you when I pretended I wanted
to hire a clerk," began Hornblower, "but I had good reason for
doing so; that reason I can't give for the present. Now," and
here Mr. Hornblower took a pencil and note-book from his pocket,
"I want to know your full name and exact age."</p>

<p>These were truthfully given and carefully written down.</p>

<p>"Now I want to know all about your parents, their age, your father's
business, and various other matters which I shall ask you."</p>

<p>Jim had no reason to decline any information he was able to give,
and he furnished all his captor desired to know.</p>

<p>When the examination was finished, the note-book was closed,
and Mr. Hornblower asked, in the most friendly of tones,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have they used you well?"</p>

<p>"They have," was the truthful reply.</p>

<p>"Do you know why?"</p>

<p>"I suppose because you instructed them to do so."</p>

<p>"It's not that, but because you behaved yourself; you haven't
made any trouble."</p>

<p>"I don't intend to do that, for there's nothing to gain by it.
I haven't any work to do, and may as well stay here as anywhere
else."</p>

<p>"Remember what I told you; so long as you keep quiet you are
safe, but only on those conditions."</p>

<p>As the man rose to go, Jim plucked up enough courage to ask,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you be kind enough to let me know where we are going, and
why it is you make a prisoner of me?"</p>

<p>"Since you have behaved so well I suppose I might as well do
so."</p>

<p>Hornblower opened his mouth to impart the information, when he
changed his mind and shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is scarcely best at present; good-evening."</p>

<p>As there seemed to be no objection to following him on deck,
Jim did so, much disappointed that he did not secure the information
which was almost his.</p>

<p>Hornblower stepped down into a boat and rowed off toward shore,
leaving the huge negro behind. It had become so dark that the
boat, with its single occupant, speedily faded from view in the
night, though the sound of the regularly swaying oars came back
distinctly across the water until shore was reached.</p>

<p>Jim was glad that the African, whom he heard addressed as Sam,
was left behind. He saw he was a good-natured fellow, and he believed
he would be able to gain something from him.</p>

<p>After supper was eaten, the schooner hoisted anchor and moved
several miles up the river, when it again lay to for the night.</p>

<p>Jim Travers went to bed again as much mystified as ever over
the explanation of his imprisonment on board the boat. Aside from
this inscrutable ignorance there was nothing very unpleasant,
and he would have been willing to make quite a lengthy stay, whether
he received any wages or not.</p>

<p>During the bitter cold weather, any one situated as he was might
be thankful if he could secure lodging for the winter.</p>

<p>"They needn't be so afraid of my running away," he often said
to himself, "for I would not be so foolish as to do that when
I don't know where to go. All that I wish is that they would give
me the chance to send a letter to Tom and let him know where I
am. The poor fellow must be greatly worried over me."</p>

<p>He ventured to ask whether he would be permitted to send a letter
ashore, but the refusal was given in such an angry manner that
he regretted making it.</p>

<p>Several days now followed, during which the schooner beat up
and down Delaware Bay without making a landing.</p>

<p>One night the vessel was caught in such a terrific blow that
she came within a hair of being driven on the Jersey shore. The
two men, however, were fine sailors, and assisted by the negro
Sam, who was also an expert, they safely rode through the gale.</p>

<p>In the course of a week they approached the wharves at Philadelphia,
where they were boarded by the proper officers. The latter seemed
to find everything all right on board the schooner, and departed,
apparently without noticing the boy standing near, who watched
their motions with great interest.</p>

<p>The Simoon lay at the wharf all night, which was unusually mild
for that season of the year.</p>

<p>The cabin door was open and the negro was on duty, while one
of the men was asleep in the hammock over Jim's head.</p>

<p>The second sailor had gone up-town somewhere, and there was no
telling when he would return.</p>

<p>The lad was nearly asleep, when he heard footsteps on deck; and
in the dim light from the lamp he observed the missing sailor
coming down the steps, followed closely by Hornblower. When they
were fairly within they shut the door, and the seaman turned up
the wick of the lamp overhead.</p>

<p>A fancy struck Jim at this moment that he would pretend he was
unconscious, though he had little hope of gaining anything by
it.</p>

<p>As soon as the light filled the apartment, Hornblower looked
over at the two forms stretched out in the hammocks, and asked
in a whisper,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are they asleep?"</p>

<p>The sailor leaned over each in turn, and carefully surveyed the
features and listened to the breathing.</p>

<p>"Yes; they don't know any more than a couple of logs."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have the boy overhear us for the world."</p>

<p>"There ain't any danger of that."</p>

<p>Thus believing, the two men talked business straight along.</p>

<p>"It won't do to stay here any longer," said Hornblower.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it's dangerous; you was such a fool yesterday as to
allow the boy on deck when the officer was there, and he couldn't
help noticing him."</p>

<p>"But they didn't speak to each other, and if the officer had
suspected anything he would have showed it."</p>

<p>"Maybe he would and maybe he wouldn't; you must know that the
boy's photograph has been scattered over the country, and he is
likely to be recognized by any countryman."</p>

<p>"How are you making out with the negotiations?"</p>

<p>"It all looks well enough, if you don't spoil it by your tomfoolery.
I should not have been surprised to find you had allowed him to
go ashore to look around a little. You must leave here to-morrow
morning. You ought to start to-night."</p>

<p>"I can do so if you wish it," said the sailor, rather sulkily.</p>

<p>"It might draw suspicion to you. No, you can wait till daylight,
and then be off."</p>

<p>"It shall be done."</p>

<p>"We have managed to throw everybody off the scent pretty well.
They seem to have all sorts of theories except the right one.
It has got into the newspapers, of course. Some think the boy
has been taken to England, others that he is in the South, and
others have sworn that he has been seen in company with a man
and woman in Canada; but no one imagines as yet that he is on
board the schooner Simoon, in the Delaware."</p>

<p>"How have you made out in your correspondence with the guardians?"</p>

<p>"They have agreed to give me ten thousand dollars if I restore
the boy to them, and I have concluded to take it; but you understand,
Bob, that it's a mighty delicate matter to handle."</p>

<p>"I rather think it is," growled Bob in reply; "for if they manage
to handle us, we'll fetch up in State prison as sure as we live."</p>

<p>"We'd be glad to get there away from the mob," said Hornblower;
"for, the way people feel over this business, they would act like
a lot of famished lions toward us."</p>

<p>"If they agree to give what you ask, why don't you turn over
the chap to them and have done with the whole business? I'm getting
tired of dodging about in this fashion, never knowing when they're
going to drop down on us, and feeling as if the prison-door was
open just ahead. It's got to be wound up pretty soon, or I'll
step out and let you finish it yourself."</p>

<p>"Have patience," said Hornblower in a conciliatory voice; "it
will all come right, for we've the game in our own hands."</p>

<p>"Why the delay, then?"</p>

<p>"There's fear of the police; they mixed in, and they're bound
to scoop us if they can, and cheat us out of the money."</p>

<p>"There's been a big reward offered by the guardians themselves?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The officers have that as well as the glory of victory
to urge them on, and they won't let a chance slip."</p>

<p>"Have you put it to the guardians strong?"</p>

<p>"You'd better believe I have. I told them that at the first attempt
they made to play us false, the boy would be sent home to them
in a coffin. They understand that."</p>

<p>"Then, why don't they play square?"</p>

<p>"They would if it wasn't for the detectives. But with the help
of the parents I think we can pull through all straight."</p>

<p>"In how long a time?"</p>

<p>"Two or three weeks. In the meantime go on south, and I'll keep
track of you and let you know what to do."</p>

<p>With these parting directions the conversation ended. Mr. Hornblower
produced a flask of whisky, the two drank each other's health,
and the visitor departed.</p>

<p>Shortly after Bob, the sailor, turned in for the night.</p>
