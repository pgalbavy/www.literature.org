 <BR>
Descend from Heav'n URANIA, by that name <BR>
If rightly thou art call'd, whose Voice divine <BR>
Following, above th' OLYMPIAN Hill I soare, <BR>
Above the flight of PEGASEAN wing. <BR>
The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou <BR>
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top <BR>
Of old OLYMPUS dwell'st, but Heav'nlie borne, <BR>
Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow'd, <BR>
Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse, <BR>
Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play <BR>
In presence of th' Almightie Father, pleas'd <BR>
With thy Celestial Song.  Up led by thee <BR>
Into the Heav'n of Heav'ns I have presum'd, <BR>
An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire, <BR>
Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down <BR>
Return me to my Native Element: <BR>
Least from this flying Steed unrein'd, (as once <BR>
BELLEROPHON, though from a lower Clime) <BR>
Dismounted, on th' ALEIAN Field I fall <BR>
Erroneous, there to wander and forlorne. <BR>
Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound <BR>
Within the visible Diurnal Spheare; <BR>
Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole, <BR>
More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang'd <BR>
To hoarce or mute, though fall'n on evil dayes, <BR>
On evil dayes though fall'n, and evil tongues; <BR>
In darkness, and with dangers compast rouud, <BR>
And solitude; yet not alone, while thou <BR>
Visit'st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn <BR>
Purples the East: still govern thou my Song, <BR>
URANIA, and fit audience find, though few. <BR>
But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance <BR>
Of BACCHUS and his Revellers, the Race <BR>
Of that wilde Rout that tore the THRACIAN Bard <BR>
In RHODOPE, where Woods and Rocks had Eares <BR>
To rapture, till the savage clamor dround <BR>
Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend <BR>
Her Son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores: <BR>
For thou art Heav'nlie, shee an empty dreame. <BR>
<BR>
  Say Goddess, what ensu'd when RAPHAEL, <BR>
The affable Arch-angel, had forewarn'd <BR>
ADAM by dire example to beware <BR>
Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven <BR>
To those Apostates, least the like befall <BR>
In Paradise to ADAM or his Race, <BR>
Charg'd not to touch the interdicted Tree, <BR>
If they transgress, and slight that sole command, <BR>
So easily obeyd amid the choice <BR>
Of all tasts else to please thir appetite, <BR>
Though wandring.  He with his consorted EVE <BR>
The storie heard attentive, and was fill'd <BR>
With admiration, and deep Muse to heare <BR>
Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought <BR>
So unimaginable as hate in Heav'n, <BR>
And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss <BR>
With such confusion: but the evil soon <BR>
Driv'n back redounded as a flood on those <BR>
From whom it sprung, impossible to mix <BR>
With Blessedness.  Whence ADAM soon repeal'd <BR>
The doubts that in his heart arose: and now <BR>
Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know <BR>
What neerer might concern him, how this World <BR>
Of Heav'n and Earth conspicuous first began, <BR>
When, and whereof created, for what cause, <BR>
What within EDEN or without was done <BR>
Before his memorie, as one whose drouth <BR>
Yet scarce allay'd still eyes the current streame, <BR>
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, <BR>
Proceeded thus to ask his Heav'nly Guest. <BR>
<BR>
  Great things, and full of wonder in our eares, <BR>
Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal'd <BR>
Divine Interpreter, by favour sent <BR>
Down from the Empyrean to forewarne <BR>
Us timely of what might else have bin our loss, <BR>
Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach: <BR>
For which to the infinitly Good we owe <BR>
Immortal thanks, and his admonishment <BR>
Receave with solemne purpose to observe <BR>
Immutably his sovran will, the end <BR>
Of what we are.  But since thou hast voutsaf't <BR>
Gently for our instruction to impart <BR>
Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd <BR>
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd, <BR>
Deign to descend now lower, and relate <BR>
What may no less perhaps availe us known, <BR>
How first began this Heav'n which we behold <BR>
Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd <BR>
Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills <BR>
All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus'd <BR>
Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause <BR>
Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest <BR>
Through all Eternitie so late to build <BR>
In CHAOS, and the work begun, how soon <BR>
Absolv'd, if unforbid thou maist unfould <BR>
What wee, not to explore the secrets aske <BR>
Of his Eternal Empire, but the more <BR>
To magnifie his works, the more we know. <BR>
And the great Light of Day yet wants to run <BR>
Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav'n <BR>
Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares, <BR>
And longer will delay to heare thee tell <BR>
His Generation, and the rising Birth <BR>
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: <BR>
Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon <BR>
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring <BR>
Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch, <BR>
Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song <BR>
End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus ADAM his illustrous Guest besought: <BR>
<BR>
  And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde. <BR>
This also thy request with caution askt <BR>
Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works <BR>
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, <BR>
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? <BR>
Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve <BR>
To glorifie the Maker, and inferr <BR>
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld <BR>
Thy hearing, such Commission from above <BR>
I have receav'd, to answer thy desire <BR>
Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain <BR>
To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope <BR>
Things not reveal'd, which th' invisible King, <BR>
Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night, <BR>
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: <BR>
Anough is left besides to search and know. <BR>
But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less <BR>
Her Temperance over Appetite, to know <BR>
In measure what the mind may well contain, <BR>
Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns <BR>
Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde. <BR>
<BR>
  Know then, that after LUCIFER from Heav'n <BR>
(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host <BR>
Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among) <BR>
Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep <BR>
Into his place, and the great Son returnd <BR>
Victorious with his Saints, th' Omnipotent <BR>
Eternal Father from his Throne beheld <BR>
Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake. <BR>
<BR>
  At least our envious Foe hath fail'd, who thought <BR>
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid <BR>
This inaccessible high strength, the seat <BR>
Of Deitie supream, us dispossest, <BR>
He trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud <BR>
Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more; <BR>
Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see, <BR>
Thir station, Heav'n yet populous retaines <BR>
Number sufficient to possess her Realmes <BR>
Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent <BR>
With Ministeries due and solemn Rites: <BR>
But least his heart exalt him in the harme <BR>
Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heav'n, <BR>
My damage fondly deem'd, I can repaire <BR>
That detriment, if such it be to lose <BR>
Self-lost, and in a moment will create <BR>
Another World, out of one man a Race <BR>
Of men innumerable, there to dwell, <BR>
Not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd <BR>
They open to themselves at length the way <BR>
Up hither, under long obedience tri'd, <BR>
And Earth be chang'd to Heavn, &amp; Heav'n to Earth, <BR>
One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end. <BR>
Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav'n, <BR>
And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee <BR>
This I perform, speak thou, and be it don: <BR>
My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee <BR>
I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep <BR>
Within appointed bounds be Heav'n and Earth, <BR>
Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill <BR>
Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. <BR>
Though I uncircumscrib'd my self retire, <BR>
And put not forth my goodness, which is free <BR>
To act or not, Necessitie and Chance <BR>
Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake <BR>
His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect. <BR>
Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift <BR>
Then time or motion, but to human ears <BR>
Cannot without process of speech be told, <BR>
So told as earthly notion can receave. <BR>
Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n <BR>
When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will; <BR>
Glorie they sung to the most High, good will <BR>
To future men, and in thir dwellings peace: <BR>
Glorie to him whose just avenging ire <BR>
Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight <BR>
And th' habitations of the just; to him <BR>
Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd <BR>
Good out of evil to create, in stead <BR>
Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring <BR>
Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse <BR>
His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. <BR>
So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son <BR>
On his great Expedition now appeer'd, <BR>
Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd <BR>
Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love <BR>
Immense, and all his Father in him shon. <BR>
About his Chariot numberless were pour'd <BR>
Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, <BR>
And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd, <BR>
From the Armoury of God, where stand of old <BR>
Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd <BR>
Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, <BR>
Celestial Equipage; and now came forth <BR>
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, <BR>
Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide <BR>
Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound <BR>
On golden Hinges moving, to let forth <BR>
The King of Glorie in his powerful Word <BR>
And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. <BR>
On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore <BR>
They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss <BR>
Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, <BR>
Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes <BR>
And surging waves, as Mountains to assault <BR>
Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. <BR>
<BR>
  Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace, <BR>
Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end: <BR>
<BR>
  Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim <BR>
Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode <BR>
Farr into CHAOS, and the World unborn; <BR>
For CHAOS heard his voice: him all his Traine <BR>
Follow'd in bright procession to behold <BR>
Creation, and the wonders of his might. <BR>
Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand <BR>
He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd <BR>
In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe <BR>
This Universe, and all created things: <BR>
One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd <BR>
Round through the vast profunditie obscure, <BR>
And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, <BR>
This be thy just Circumference, O World. <BR>
Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth, <BR>
Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound <BR>
Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme <BR>
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, <BR>
And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth <BR>
Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd <BR>
The black tartareous cold infernal dregs <BR>
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd <BR>
Like things to like, the rest to several place <BR>
Disparted, and between spun out the Air, <BR>
And Earth self-ballanc't on her Center hung. <BR>
<BR>
  Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light <BR>
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure <BR>
Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East <BR>
To journie through the airie gloom began, <BR>
Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun <BR>
Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle <BR>
Sojourn'd the while.  God saw the Light was good; <BR>
And light from darkness by the Hemisphere <BR>
Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night <BR>
He nam'd.  Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn: <BR>
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung <BR>
By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light <BR>
Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; <BR>
Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout <BR>
The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd, <BR>
And touch't thir Golden Harps, &amp; hymning prais'd <BR>
God and his works, Creatour him they sung, <BR>
Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. <BR>
<BR>
  Again, God said, let ther be Firmament <BR>
Amid the Waters, and let it divide <BR>
The Waters from the Waters: and God made <BR>
The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, <BR>
Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd <BR>
In circuit to the uttermost convex <BR>
Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, <BR>
The Waters underneath from those above <BR>
Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World <BR>
Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide <BR>
Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule <BR>
Of CHAOS farr remov'd, least fierce extreames <BR>
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: <BR>
And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n <BR>
And Morning CHORUS sung the second Day. <BR>
<BR>
  The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet <BR>
Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, <BR>
Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth <BR>
Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme <BR>
Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe, <BR>
Fermented the great Mother to conceave, <BR>
Satiate with genial moisture, when God said <BR>
Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n <BR>
Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. <BR>
Immediately the Mountains huge appeer <BR>
Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave <BR>
Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: <BR>
So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low <BR>
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, <BR>
Capacious bed of Waters: thither they <BR>
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld <BR>
As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; <BR>
Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, <BR>
For haste; such flight the great command impress'd <BR>
On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call <BR>
Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) <BR>
Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, <BR>
Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, <BR>
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, <BR>
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, <BR>
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide <BR>
With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, <BR>
And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; <BR>
Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie, <BR>
All but within those banks, where Rivers now <BR>
Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. <BR>
The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle <BR>
Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas: <BR>
And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth <BR>
Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed, <BR>
And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind; <BR>
Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. <BR>
He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then <BR>
Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, <BR>
Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad <BR>
Her Universal Face with pleasant green, <BR>
Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd <BR>
Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay <BR>
Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, <BR>
Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept <BR>
The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed <BR>
Embattell'd in her field: add the humble Shrub, <BR>
And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last <BR>
Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred <BR>
Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd <BR>
Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd, <BR>
With tufts the vallies &amp; each fountain side, <BR>
With borders long the Rivers.  That Earth now <BR>
Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell, <BR>
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt <BR>
Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd <BR>
Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground <BR>
None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist <BR>
Went up and waterd all the ground, and each <BR>
Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth <BR>
God made, and every Herb, before it grew <BR>
On the green stemm; God saw that it was good: <BR>
So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day. <BR>
<BR>
  Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights <BR>
High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide <BR>
The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, <BR>
For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, <BR>
And let them be for Lights as I ordaine <BR>
Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n <BR>
To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. <BR>
And God made two great Lights, great for thir use <BR>
To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, <BR>
The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, <BR>
And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n <BR>
To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day <BR>
In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, <BR>
And Light from Darkness to divide.  God saw, <BR>
Surveying his great Work, that it was good: <BR>
For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun <BR>
A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, <BR>
Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon <BR>
Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs, <BR>
And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field: <BR>
Of Light by farr the greater part he took, <BR>
Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd <BR>
In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive <BR>
And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine <BR>
Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light. <BR>
Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs <BR>
Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light, <BR>
And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns; <BR>
By tincture or reflection they augment <BR>
Thir small peculiar, though from human sight <BR>
So farr remote, with diminution seen. <BR>
First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, <BR>
Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round <BR>
Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run <BR>
His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray <BR>
Dawn, and the PLEIADES before him danc'd <BR>
Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, <BR>
But opposite in leveld West was set <BR>
His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light <BR>
From him, for other light she needed none <BR>
In that aspect, and still that distance keepes <BR>
Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, <BR>
Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign <BR>
With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, <BR>
With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd <BR>
Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd <BR>
With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, <BR>
Glad Eevning &amp; glad Morn crownd the fourth day. <BR>
<BR>
  And God said, let the Waters generate <BR>
Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: <BR>
And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings <BR>
Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n. <BR>
And God created the great Whales, and each <BR>
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously <BR>
The waters generated by thir kindes, <BR>
And every Bird of wing after his kinde; <BR>
And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, <BR>
Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas <BR>
And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; <BR>
And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth. <BR>
Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek &amp; Bay <BR>
With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales <BR>
Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales <BR>
Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft <BR>
Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate <BR>
Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, &amp; through Groves <BR>
Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance <BR>
Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold, <BR>
Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend <BR>
Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food <BR>
In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, <BR>
And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk <BR>
Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate <BR>
Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan <BR>
Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep <BR>
Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, <BR>
And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles <BR>
Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea. <BR>
Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares <BR>
Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon <BR>
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd <BR>
Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge <BR>
They summ'd thir Penns, and soaring th' air sublime <BR>
With clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud <BR>
In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork <BR>
On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build: <BR>
Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise <BR>
In common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way, <BR>
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth <BR>
Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea's <BR>
Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing <BR>
Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane <BR>
Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire <BR>
Floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes: <BR>
From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song <BR>
Solac'd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings <BR>
Till Ev'n, nor then the solemn Nightingal <BR>
Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes: <BR>
Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd <BR>
Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck <BR>
Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes <BR>
Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit <BR>
The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre <BR>
The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground <BR>
Walk'd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds <BR>
The silent hours, and th' other whose gay Traine <BR>
Adorns him, colour'd with the Florid hue <BR>
Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes.  The Waters thus <BR>
With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle, <BR>
Ev'ning and Morn solemniz'd the Fift day. <BR>
<BR>
  The Sixt, and of Creation last arose <BR>
With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said, <BR>
Let th' Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde, <BR>
Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth, <BR>
Each in their kinde.  The Earth obey'd, and strait <BR>
Op'ning her fertil Woomb teem'd at a Birth <BR>
Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes, <BR>
Limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up-rose <BR>
As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns <BR>
In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den; <BR>
Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk'd: <BR>
The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green: <BR>
Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks <BR>
Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung: <BR>
The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd <BR>
The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free <BR>
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, <BR>
And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce, <BR>
The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale <BR>
Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw <BR>
In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground <BR>
Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould <BR>
BEHEMOTH biggest born of Earth upheav'd <BR>
His vastness: Fleec't the Flocks and bleating rose, <BR>
As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land <BR>
The River Horse and scalie Crocodile. <BR>
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, <BR>
Insect or Worme; those wav'd thir limber fans <BR>
For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact <BR>
In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride <BR>
With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green: <BR>
These as a line thir long dimension drew, <BR>
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all <BR>
Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde <BR>
Wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd <BR>
Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings.  First crept <BR>
The Parsimonious Emmet, provident <BR>
Of future, in small room large heart enclos'd, <BR>
Pattern of just equalitie perhaps <BR>
Hereafter, join'd in her popular Tribes <BR>
Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer'd <BR>
The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone <BR>
Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells <BR>
With Honey stor'd: the rest are numberless, <BR>
And thou thir Natures know'st, and gav'st them Names, <BR>
Needlest to thee repeaed; nor unknown <BR>
The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field, <BR>
Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes <BR>
And hairie Main terrific, though to thee <BR>
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. <BR>
Now Heav'n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld <BR>
Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand <BR>
First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire <BR>
Consummate lovly smil'd; Aire, Water, Earth, <BR>
By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt <BR>
Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain'd; <BR>
There wanted yet the Master work, the end <BR>
Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone <BR>
And Brute as other Creatures, but endu'd <BR>
With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect <BR>
His Stature, and upright with Front serene <BR>
Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence <BR>
Magnanimous to correspond with Heav'n, <BR>
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good <BR>
Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes <BR>
Directed in Devotion, to adore <BR>
And worship God Supream, who made him chief <BR>
Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent <BR>
Eternal Father (For where is not hee <BR>
Present) thus to his Son audibly spake. <BR>
<BR>
  Let us make now Man in our image, Man <BR>
In our similitude, and let them rule <BR>
Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire, <BR>
Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth, <BR>
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. <BR>
This said, he formd thee, ADAM, thee O Man <BR>
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd <BR>
The breath of Life; in his own Image hee <BR>
Created thee, in the Image of God <BR>
Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul. <BR>
Male he created thee, but thy consort <BR>
Femal for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said, <BR>
Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth, <BR>
Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold <BR>
Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire, <BR>
And every living thing that moves on the Earth. <BR>
Wherever thus created, for no place <BR>
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know'st <BR>
He brought thee into this delicious Grove, <BR>
This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, <BR>
Delectable both to behold and taste; <BR>
And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food <BR>
Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' Earth yeelds, <BR>
Varietie without end; but of the Tree <BR>
Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, <BR>
Thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st; <BR>
Death is the penaltie impos'd, beware, <BR>
And govern well thy appetite, least sin <BR>
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. <BR>
Here finish'd hee, and all that he had made <BR>
View'd, and behold all was entirely good; <BR>
So Ev'n and Morn accomplish'd the Sixt day: <BR>
Yet not till the Creator from his work <BR>
Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd <BR>
Up to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode, <BR>
Thence to behold this new created World <BR>
Th' addition of his Empire, how it shew'd <BR>
In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, <BR>
Answering his great Idea.  Up he rode <BR>
Followd with acclamation and the sound <BR>
Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun'd <BR>
Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire <BR>
Resounded, (thou remember'st, for thou heardst) <BR>
The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung, <BR>
The Planets in thir stations list'ning stood, <BR>
While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant. <BR>
Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung, <BR>
Open, ye Heav'ns, your living dores; let in <BR>
The great Creator from his work returnd <BR>
Magnificent, his Six days work, a World; <BR>
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne <BR>
To visit oft the dwellings of just Men <BR>
Delighted, and with frequent intercourse <BR>
Thither will send his winged Messengers <BR>
On errands of supernal Grace.  So sung <BR>
The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav'n, <BR>
That open'd wide her blazing Portals, led <BR>
To Gods Eternal house direct the way, <BR>
A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold <BR>
And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer, <BR>
Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way <BR>
Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest <BR>
Pouderd with Starrs.  And now on Earth the Seaventh <BR>
Eev'ning arose in EDEN, for the Sun <BR>
Was set, and twilight from the East came on, <BR>
Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount <BR>
Of Heav'ns high-seated top, th' Impereal Throne <BR>
Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure, <BR>
The Filial Power arriv'd, and sate him down <BR>
With his great Father (for he also went <BR>
Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge <BR>
Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd, <BR>
Author and end of all things, and from work <BR>
Now resting, bless'd and hallowd the Seav'nth day, <BR>
As resting on that day from all his work, <BR>
But not in silence holy kept; the Harp <BR>
Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe, <BR>
And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop, <BR>
All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire <BR>
Temper'd soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice <BR>
Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds <BR>
Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount. <BR>
Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung, <BR>
Great are thy works, JEHOVAH, infinite <BR>
Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue <BR>
Relate thee; greater now in thy return <BR>
Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day <BR>
Thy Thunders magnifi'd; but to create <BR>
Is greater then created to destroy. <BR>
Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound <BR>
Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt <BR>
Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine <BR>
Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought <BR>
Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw <BR>
The number of thy worshippers.  Who seekes <BR>
To lessen thee, against his purpose serves <BR>
To manifest the more thy might: his evil <BR>
Thou usest, and from thence creat'st more good. <BR>
Witness this new-made World, another Heav'n <BR>
From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view <BR>
On the cleer HYALINE, the Glassie Sea; <BR>
Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's <BR>
Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World <BR>
Of destind habitation; but thou know'st <BR>
Thir seasons: among these the seat of men, <BR>
Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd, <BR>
Thir pleasant dwelling place.  Thrice happie men, <BR>
And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc't, <BR>
Created in his Image, there to dwell <BR>
And worship him, and in reward to rule <BR>
Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air, <BR>
And multiply a Race of Worshippers <BR>
Holy and just: thrice happie if they know <BR>
Thir happiness, and persevere upright. <BR>
<BR>
  So sung they, and the Empyrean rung, <BR>
With HALLELUIAHS: Thus was Sabbath kept. <BR>
And thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd <BR>
How first this World and face of things began, <BR>
And what before thy memorie was don <BR>
From the beginning, that posteritie <BR>
Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst <BR>
Aught, not surpassing human measure, say. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus ADAM gratefully repli'd. <BR>
What thanks sufficient, or what recompence <BR>
Equal have I to render thee, Divine <BR>
Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd <BR>
The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf't <BR>
This friendly condescention to relate <BR>
Things else by me unsearchable, now heard <BR>
VVith wonder, but delight, and, as is due, <BR>
With glorie attributed to the high <BR>
Creator; some thing yet of doubt remaines, <BR>
VVhich onely thy solution can resolve. <BR>
VVhen I behold this goodly Frame, this VVorld <BR>
Of Heav'n and Earth consisting, and compute, <BR>
Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine, <BR>
An Atom, with the Firmament compar'd <BR>
And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle <BR>
Spaces incomprehensible (for such <BR>
Thir distance argues and thir swift return <BR>
Diurnal) meerly to officiate light <BR>
Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot, <BR>
One day and night; in all thir vast survey <BR>
Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire, <BR>
How Nature wise and frugal could commit <BR>
Such disproportions, with superfluous hand <BR>
So many nobler Bodies to create, <BR>
Greater so manifold to this one use, <BR>
For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose <BR>
Such restless revolution day by day <BR>
Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth, <BR>
That better might with farr less compass move, <BR>
Serv'd by more noble then her self, attaines <BR>
Her end without least motion, and receaves, <BR>
As Tribute such a sumless journey brought <BR>
Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; <BR>
Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake our Sire, and by his count'nance seemd <BR>
Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which EVE <BR>
Perceaving where she sat retir'd in sight, <BR>
With lowliness Majestic from her seat, <BR>
And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay, <BR>
Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours, <BR>
To visit how they prosper'd, bud and bloom, <BR>
Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung <BR>
And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew. <BR>
Yet went she not, as not with such discourse <BR>
Delighted, or not capable her eare <BR>
Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv'd, <BR>
ADAM relating, she sole Auditress; <BR>
Her Husband the Relater she preferr'd <BR>
Before the Angel, and of him to ask <BR>
Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix <BR>
Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute <BR>
With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip <BR>
Not Words alone pleas'd her.  O when meet now <BR>
Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn'd? <BR>
With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went; <BR>
Not unattended, for on her as Queen <BR>
A pomp of winning Graces waited still, <BR>
And from about her shot Darts of desire <BR>
Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight. <BR>
And RAPHAEL now to ADAM's doubt propos'd <BR>
Benevolent and facil thus repli'd. <BR>
<BR>
  To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav'n <BR>
Is as the Book of God before thee set, <BR>
Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne <BR>
His Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares: <BR>
This to attain, whether Heav'n move or Earth, <BR>
Imports not, if thou reck'n right, the rest <BR>
From Man or Angel the great Architect <BR>
Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge <BR>
His secrets to be scann'd by them who ought <BR>
Rather admire; or if they list to try <BR>
Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav'ns <BR>
Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move <BR>
His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide <BR>
Hereafter, when they come to model Heav'n <BR>
And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild <BR>
The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive <BR>
To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear <BR>
With Centric and Eccentric scribl'd o're, <BR>
Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb: <BR>
Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess, <BR>
Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest <BR>
That Bodies bright and greater should not serve <BR>
The less not bright, nor Heav'n such journies run, <BR>
Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves <BR>
The benefit: consider first, that Great <BR>
Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth <BR>
Though, in comparison of Heav'n, so small, <BR>
Nor glistering, may of solid good containe <BR>
More plenty then the Sun that barren shines, <BR>
Whose vertue on it self workes no effect, <BR>
But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd <BR>
His beams, unactive else, thir vigor find. <BR>
Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries <BR>
Officious, but to thee Earths habitant. <BR>
And for the Heav'ns wide Circuit, let it speak <BR>
The Makers high magnificence, who built <BR>
So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr; <BR>
That Man may know he dwells not in his own; <BR>
An Edifice too large for him to fill, <BR>
Lodg'd in a small partition, and the rest <BR>
Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known. <BR>
The swiftness of those Circles attribute, <BR>
Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, <BR>
That to corporeal substances could adde <BR>
Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow, <BR>
Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav'n <BR>
Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv'd <BR>
In EDEN, distance inexpressible <BR>
By Numbers that have name.  But this I urge, <BR>
Admitting Motion in the Heav'ns, to shew <BR>
Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov'd; <BR>
Not that I so affirm, though so it seem <BR>
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. <BR>
God to remove his wayes from human sense, <BR>
Plac'd Heav'n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight, <BR>
If it presume, might erre in things too high, <BR>
And no advantage gaine.  What if the Sun <BR>
Be Center to the World, and other Starrs <BR>
By his attractive vertue and thir own <BR>
Incited, dance about him various rounds? <BR>
Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid, <BR>
Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, <BR>
In six thou seest, and what if sev'nth to these <BR>
The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem, <BR>
Insensibly three different Motions move? <BR>
Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe, <BR>
Mov'd contrarie with thwart obliquities, <BR>
Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift <BR>
Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos'd, <BR>
Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele <BR>
Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe, <BR>
If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day <BR>
Travelling East, and with her part averse <BR>
From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part <BR>
Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light <BR>
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire, <BR>
To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr <BR>
Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night <BR>
This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there, <BR>
Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest <BR>
As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce <BR>
Fruits in her soft'nd Soile, for some to eate <BR>
Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps <BR>
With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie <BR>
Communicating Male and Femal Light, <BR>
Which two great Sexes animate the World, <BR>
Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that live. <BR>
For such vast room in Nature unpossest <BR>
By living Soule, desert and desolate, <BR>
Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute <BR>
Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr <BR>
Down to this habitable, which returnes <BR>
Light back to them, is obvious to dispute. <BR>
But whether thus these things, or whether not, <BR>
Whether the Sun predominant in Heav'n <BR>
Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun, <BR>
Hee from the East his flaming rode begin, <BR>
Or Shee from West her silent course advance <BR>
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps <BR>
On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n, <BR>
And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along, <BR>
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid, <BR>
Leave them to God above, him serve and feare; <BR>
Of other Creatures, as him pleases best, <BR>
Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy thou <BR>
In what he gives to thee, this Paradise <BR>
And thy faire EVE; Heav'n is for thee too high <BR>
To know what passes there; be lowlie wise: <BR>
Think onely what concernes thee and thy being; <BR>
Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there <BR>
Live, in what state, condition or degree, <BR>
Contented that thus farr hath been reveal'd <BR>
Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav'n. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus ADAM cleerd of doubt, repli'd. <BR>
How fully hast thou satisfi'd mee, pure <BR>
Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene, <BR>
And freed from intricacies, taught to live, <BR>
The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts <BR>
To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which <BR>
God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, <BR>
And not molest us, unless we our selves <BR>
Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine. <BR>
But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave <BR>
Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; <BR>
Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne, <BR>
That not to know at large of things remote <BR>
From use, obscure and suttle, but to know <BR>
That which before us lies in daily life, <BR>
Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, <BR>
Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, <BR>
And renders us in things that most concerne <BR>
Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek. <BR>
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend <BR>
A lower flight, and speak of things at hand <BR>
Useful, whence haply mention may arise <BR>
Of somthing not unseasonable to ask <BR>
By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd. <BR>
Thee I have heard relating what was don <BR>
Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate <BR>
My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard; <BR>
And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest <BR>
How suttly to detaine thee I devise, <BR>
Inviting thee to hear while I relate, <BR>
Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: <BR>
For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n, <BR>
And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare <BR>
Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst <BR>
And hunger both, from labour, at the houre <BR>
Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, <BR>
Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine <BR>
Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus RAPHAEL answer'd heav'nly meek. <BR>
Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, <BR>
Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee <BR>
Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd, <BR>
Inward and outward both, his image faire: <BR>
Speaking or mute all comliness and grace <BR>
Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes. <BR>
Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth <BR>
Then of our fellow servant, and inquire <BR>
Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: <BR>
For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set <BR>
On Man his equal Love: say therefore on; <BR>
For I that Day was absent, as befell, <BR>
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, <BR>
Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; <BR>
Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had) <BR>
To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie, <BR>
Or enemie, while God was in his work, <BR>
Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, <BR>
Destruction with Creation might have mixt. <BR>
Not that they durst without his leave attempt, <BR>
But us he sends upon his high behests <BR>
For state, as Sovran King, and to enure <BR>
Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut <BR>
The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong; <BR>
But long ere our approaching heard within <BR>
Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, <BR>
Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage. <BR>
Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light <BR>
Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge. <BR>
But thy relation now; for I attend, <BR>
Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. <BR>
For Man to tell how human Life began <BR>
Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? <BR>
Desire with thee still longer to converse <BR>
Induc'd me.  As new wak't from soundest sleep <BR>
Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid <BR>
In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun <BR>
Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed. <BR>
Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd, <BR>
And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd <BR>
By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, <BR>
As thitherward endevoring, and upright <BR>
Stood on my feet; about me round I saw <BR>
Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, <BR>
And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, <BR>
Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew, <BR>
Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd, <BR>
With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd. <BR>
My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb <BR>
Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran <BR>
With supple joints, as lively vigour led: <BR>
But who I was, or where, or from what cause, <BR>
Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake, <BR>
My Tongue obey'd and readily could name <BR>
What e're I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, <BR>
And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay, <BR>
Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, <BR>
And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, <BR>
Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? <BR>
Not of my self; by some great Maker then, <BR>
In goodness and in power praeeminent; <BR>
Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, <BR>
From whom I have that thus I move and live, <BR>
And feel that I am happier then I know. <BR>
While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither, <BR>
From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld <BR>
This happie Light, when answer none return'd, <BR>
On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours <BR>
Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep <BR>
First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd <BR>
My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought <BR>
I then was passing to my former state <BR>
Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: <BR>
When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, <BR>
Whose inward apparition gently mov'd <BR>
My Fancy to believe I yet had being, <BR>
And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, <BR>
And said, thy Mansion wants thee, ADAM, rise, <BR>
First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd <BR>
First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide <BR>
To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd. <BR>
So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd, <BR>
And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire <BR>
Smooth sliding without step, last led me up <BR>
A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, <BR>
A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees <BR>
Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw <BR>
Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd.  Each Tree <BR>
Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye <BR>
Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite <BR>
To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found <BR>
Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream <BR>
Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun <BR>
My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide <BR>
Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd, <BR>
Presence Divine.  Rejoycing, but with aw <BR>
In adoration at his feet I fell <BR>
Submiss: he rear'd me, &amp; Whom thou soughtst I am, <BR>
Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest <BR>
Above, or round about thee or beneath. <BR>
This Paradise I give thee, count it thine <BR>
To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: <BR>
Of every Tree that in the Garden growes <BR>
Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: <BR>
But of the Tree whose operation brings <BR>
Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set <BR>
The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith, <BR>
Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life, <BR>
Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, <BR>
And shun the bitter consequence: for know, <BR>
The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command <BR>
Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; <BR>
From that day mortal, and this happie State <BR>
Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World <BR>
Of woe and sorrow.  Sternly he pronounc'd <BR>
The rigid interdiction, which resounds <BR>
Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice <BR>
Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect <BR>
Return'd and gratious purpose thus renew'd. <BR>
Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth <BR>
To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords <BR>
Possess it, and all things that therein live, <BR>
Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. <BR>
In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold <BR>
After thir kindes; I bring them to receave <BR>
From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie <BR>
With low subjection; understand the same <BR>
Of Fish within thir watry residence, <BR>
Not hither summond, since they cannot change <BR>
Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire. <BR>
As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold <BR>
Approaching two and two, These cowring low <BR>
With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing. <BR>
I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood <BR>
Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd <BR>
My sudden apprehension: but in these <BR>
I found not what me thought I wanted still; <BR>
And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd. <BR>
<BR>
  O by what Name, for thou above all these, <BR>
Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, <BR>
Surpassest farr my naming, how may I <BR>
Adore thee, Author of this Universe, <BR>
And all this good to man, for whose well being <BR>
So amply, and with hands so liberal <BR>
Thou hast provided all things: but with mee <BR>
I see not who partakes.  In solitude <BR>
What happiness, who can enjoy alone, <BR>
Or all enjoying, what contentment find? <BR>
Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, <BR>
As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd. <BR>
<BR>
  What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth <BR>
With various living creatures, and the Aire <BR>
Replenisht, and all these at thy command <BR>
To come and play before thee, know'st thou not <BR>
Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, <BR>
And reason not contemptibly; with these <BR>
Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. <BR>
So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd <BR>
So ordering.  I with leave of speech implor'd, <BR>
And humble deprecation thus repli'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power, <BR>
My Maker, be propitious while I speak. <BR>
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, <BR>
And these inferiour farr beneath me set? <BR>
Among unequals what societie <BR>
Can sort, what harmonie or true delight? <BR>
Which must be mutual, in proportion due <BR>
Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie <BR>
The one intense, the other still remiss <BR>
Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove <BR>
Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak <BR>
Such as I seek, fit to participate <BR>
All rational delight, wherein the brute <BR>
Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce <BR>
Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; <BR>
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd; <BR>
Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle <BR>
So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape; <BR>
Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. <BR>
<BR>
  Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd. <BR>
A nice and suttle happiness I see <BR>
Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice <BR>
Of thy Associates, ADAM, and wilt taste <BR>
No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. <BR>
What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State, <BR>
Seem I to thee sufficiently possest <BR>
Of happiness, or not? who am alone <BR>
From all Eternitie, for none I know <BR>
Second to mee or like, equal much less. <BR>
How have I then with whom to hold converse <BR>
Save with the Creatures which I made, and those <BR>
To me inferiour, infinite descents <BR>
Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? <BR>
<BR>
  He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd.  To attaine <BR>
The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes <BR>
All human thoughts come short, Supream of things; <BR>
Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee <BR>
Is no deficience found; not so is Man, <BR>
But in degree, the cause of his desire <BR>
By conversation with his like to help, <BR>
Or solace his defects.  No need that thou <BR>
Shouldst propagat, already infinite; <BR>
And through all numbers absolute, though One; <BR>
But Man by number is to manifest <BR>
His single imperfection, and beget <BR>
Like of his like, his Image multipli'd, <BR>
In unitie defective, which requires <BR>
Collateral love, and deerest amitie. <BR>
Thou in thy secresie although alone, <BR>
Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not <BR>
Social communication, yet so pleas'd, <BR>
Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt <BR>
Of Union or Communion, deifi'd; <BR>
I by conversing cannot these erect <BR>
From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. <BR>
Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd <BR>
Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd <BR>
This answer from the gratious voice Divine. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus farr to try thee, ADAM, I was pleas'd, <BR>
And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone, <BR>
Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self, <BR>
Expressing well the spirit within thee free, <BR>
My Image, not imparted to the Brute, <BR>
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee <BR>
Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, <BR>
And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st, <BR>
Knew it not good for Man to be alone, <BR>
And no such companie as then thou saw'st <BR>
Intended thee, for trial onely brought, <BR>
To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet: <BR>
What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd, <BR>
Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, <BR>
Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire. <BR>
<BR>
  Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now <BR>
My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd, <BR>
Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth <BR>
In that celestial Colloquie sublime, <BR>
As with an object that excels the sense, <BR>
Dazl'd and spent, sunk down, and sought repair <BR>
Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd <BR>
By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes. <BR>
Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell <BR>
Of Fancie my internal sight, by which <BR>
Abstract as in a transe methought I saw, <BR>
Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape <BR>
Still glorious before whom awake I stood; <BR>
Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took <BR>
From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, <BR>
And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, <BR>
But suddenly with flesh fill'd up &amp; heal'd: <BR>
The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands; <BR>
Under his forming hands a Creature grew, <BR>
Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire, <BR>
That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now <BR>
Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd <BR>
And in her looks, which from that time infus'd <BR>
Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, <BR>
And into all things from her Aire inspir'd <BR>
The spirit of love and amorous delight. <BR>
She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd <BR>
To find her, or for ever to deplore <BR>
Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: <BR>
When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, <BR>
Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd <BR>
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow <BR>
To make her amiable: On she came, <BR>
Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen, <BR>
And guided by his voice, nor uninformd <BR>
Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: <BR>
Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye, <BR>
In every gesture dignitie and love. <BR>
I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. <BR>
<BR>
  This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd <BR>
Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, <BR>
Giver of all things faire, but fairest this <BR>
Of all thy gifts, nor enviest.  I now see <BR>
Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self <BR>
Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man <BR>
Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe <BR>
Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; <BR>
And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. <BR>
<BR>
  She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, <BR>
Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, <BR>
Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, <BR>
That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won, <BR>
Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd, <BR>
The more desirable, or to say all, <BR>
Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, <BR>
Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd; <BR>
I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew, <BR>
And with obsequious Majestie approv'd <BR>
My pleaded reason.  To the Nuptial Bowre <BR>
I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n, <BR>
And happie Constellations on that houre <BR>
Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth <BR>
Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; <BR>
Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires <BR>
Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings <BR>
Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, <BR>
Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night <BR>
Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr <BR>
On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. <BR>
Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought <BR>
My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss <BR>
Which I enjoy, and must confess to find <BR>
In all things else delight indeed, but such <BR>
As us'd or not, works in the mind no change, <BR>
Nor vehement desire, these delicacies <BR>
I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, &amp; Flours, <BR>
Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here <BR>
Farr otherwise, transported I behold, <BR>
Transported touch; here passion first I felt, <BR>
Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else <BR>
Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake <BR>
Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. <BR>
Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part <BR>
Not proof enough such Object to sustain, <BR>
Or from my side subducting, took perhaps <BR>
More then enough; at least on her bestow'd <BR>
Too much of Ornament, in outward shew <BR>
Elaborate, of inward less exact. <BR>
For well I understand in the prime end <BR>
Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind <BR>
And inward Faculties, which most excell, <BR>
In outward also her resembling less <BR>
His Image who made both, and less expressing <BR>
The character of that Dominion giv'n <BR>
O're other Creatures; yet when I approach <BR>
Her loveliness, so absolute she seems <BR>
And in her self compleat, so well to know <BR>
Her own, that what she wills to do or say, <BR>
Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; <BR>
All higher knowledge in her presence falls <BR>
Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her <BR>
Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes; <BR>
Authoritie and Reason on her waite, <BR>
As one intended first, not after made <BR>
Occasionally; and to consummate all, <BR>
Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat <BR>
Build in her loveliest, and create an awe <BR>
About her, as a guard Angelic plac't. <BR>
To whom the Angel with contracted brow. <BR>
<BR>
  Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part; <BR>
Do thou but thine, and be not diffident <BR>
Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou <BR>
Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh, <BR>
By attributing overmuch to things <BR>
Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st. <BR>
For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so, <BR>
An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well <BR>
Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, <BR>
Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self; <BR>
Then value: Oft times nothing profits more <BR>
Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right <BR>
Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st, <BR>
The more she will acknowledge thee her Head, <BR>
And to realities yeild all her shows; <BR>
Made so adorn for thy delight the more, <BR>
So awful, that with honour thou maist love <BR>
Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. <BR>
But if the sense of touch whereby mankind <BR>
Is propagated seem such dear delight <BR>
Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't <BR>
To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be <BR>
To them made common &amp; divulg'd, if aught <BR>
Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue <BR>
The Soule of Man, or passion in him move. <BR>
What higher in her societie thou findst <BR>
Attractive, human, rational, love still; <BR>
In loving thou dost well, in passion not, <BR>
Wherein true Love consists not; love refines <BR>
The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat <BR>
In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale <BR>
By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend, <BR>
Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause <BR>
Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus half abash't ADAM repli'd. <BR>
Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught <BR>
In procreation common to all kindes <BR>
(Though higher of the genial Bed by far, <BR>
And with mysterious reverence I deem) <BR>
So much delights me, as those graceful acts, <BR>
Those thousand decencies that daily flow <BR>
From all her words and actions, mixt with Love <BR>
And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd <BR>
Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; <BR>
Harmonie to behold in wedded pair <BR>
More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare. <BR>
Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose <BR>
What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, <BR>
Who meet with various objects, from the sense <BR>
Variously representing; yet still free <BR>
Approve the best, and follow what I approve. <BR>
To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist <BR>
Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide; <BR>
Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; <BR>
Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love <BR>
Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix <BR>
Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd <BR>
Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue, <BR>
Answer'd.  Let it suffice thee that thou know'st <BR>
Us happie, and without Love no happiness. <BR>
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st <BR>
(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy <BR>
In eminence, and obstacle find none <BR>
Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs: <BR>
Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace, <BR>
Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure <BR>
Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need <BR>
As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul. <BR>
But I can now no more; the parting Sun <BR>
Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles <BR>
HESPEREAN sets, my Signal to depart. <BR>
Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all <BR>
Him whom to love is to obey, and keep <BR>
His great command; take heed least Passion sway <BR>
Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will <BR>
Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons <BR>
The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware. <BR>
I in thy persevering shall rejoyce, <BR>
And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall <BR>
Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies. <BR>
Perfet within, no outward aid require; <BR>
And all temptation to transgress repel. <BR>
<BR>
  So saying, he arose; whom ADAM thus <BR>
Follow'd with benediction.  Since to part, <BR>
Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger, <BR>
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. <BR>
Gentle to me and affable hath been <BR>
Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever <BR>
With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind <BR>
Be good and friendly still, and oft return. <BR>
<BR>
  So parted they, the Angel up to Heav'n <BR>
From the thick shade, and ADAM to his Bowre. <BR>
