<p>THERE was once a fat little, nice little, round little boy and his
name was Tim. As soon as people looked at him they began to laugh
and he began to laugh too. He had dimples on his knees and dimples
on his hands and dimples all round his mouth. That was because
Fairies liked him and used to kiss him whenever they flew past him,
and they kissed him so much that they made dimples. He had a lot of
curly hair which made a lovely mop. In fact he was lovesome all
over and no one ever denied it. But when he played about and he
never stopped playing the wind blew his curly mop into tangles, and
when he stood on his head on his bed or the grass or the nursery
floor, that rubbed it into tangles; and when he was asleep and
cuddled down into his pillows and dreamed delightful things, that
ruffled it into tangles. So after he was dressed in the morning his
mamma was obliged to brush them all out and comb out all the knots
and make him look soft and fluffy and lovesome for the rest of the
day. Now of course this might have been very horrid for both of
them. He might have wriggled and cried and she might have pulled
hard and scolded. But nothing of the sort happened because they
were both nice people. He was a nice people and she was a nice
people. So she used to sit down on a chair by a window which looked
right into a big maple tree where birds lived, and Tim used to turn
his back and stand leaning his fat little warm body against her
knee and then she would comb and brush, and while she did she told
him the Hair Curling Stories. This was one of them and it was
called:
</p>
<p><strong>THE GOOD WOLF.</strong>
</p><p>Once there was another little boy and his name was Bartholomew
Herbert Hubert Ellecompane but of course he was not called all that
at once. When people wanted him they only said Barty and he was
quite satisfied, because you see that if every time anyone wanted
to make you a present of a beautiful train or a box of caramels, he
had to call out "Bartholomew Herbert Hubert Ellecompane" before he
could give them to you, a great deal of time would be wasted.
</p><p>Well, Barty was a nice people. If he had not been you would
probably have heard crying and seen wriggling in his nursery every
morning. He lived in the time when boys wore quite long, curly hair
and if your hair is short you don't know how much combing and
brushing that takes. But Barty was so cheerful that he did not mind
it one bit and even used to laugh and chuckle and sing songs his
hair was being brushed. (When the story of the Good Wolf was being
told to Tim his mother used to feel his fat little body shake
against her knee when he heard this part because he always laughed
and chuckled at it.)
</p><p>Indeed Barty was a great blessing and a privilege. He lived on the
edge of a deep forest, and he was very fond of that forest because
there were such wonderful things in it things that grew and things
that built nests and things that burrowed under the earth and made
long passages and little warm caves to live in delightful things.
Besides which Barty had heard that there were Fairies there, though
he had never seen one.
</p><p>He was not a rich little boy, in fact he was quite poor. He had no
toys at all because his father and mother had no money. When he
went to bed. He used to lie and think of all the things he would
like to have, and when he went to sleep he sometimes dreamed he had
them, which was very nice, but when he wakened they were not there.
</p><p>One morning in the winter he wished very much for a sled because
when he looked out of the window all the ground was covered with
sparkling snow and all the trees in the forest were loaded with it,
and the sun was shining on glittering icicles hanging from the
roof.
</p><p>"I want a sled," he whispered to himself as he pressed his little
nose against the glass. "I want one I wish I had one."
</p><p>If he had not been a blessing and a privilege he would have cried,
but he actually didn't. He scrambled down and asked his mother to
put on his thick scarlet cap and coat and his rubber boots, and he
went striding out into the snow like a stout little robin red
breast.
</p><p>He stamped across the road and stamped across the field to the edge
of his beloved deep forest, because he wanted to see what things
were doing, the things that build nests and the things that burrow
and make little warm caves to live in.
</p><p>And when he reached the very edge where the thick trees began--there
he saw sitting up on its haunches and looking straight at him
an Immense Wolf.
</p><p>He gave a little jump and turned pale and was going to run away as
fast as his rubber boots would carry him, when he suddenly stopped
because he could not help it. The Wolf was speaking to him.
</p><p>"Do not be frightened," he said in a slow deep voice. "And do not
run away. I am a Good Wolf."
</p><p>Usually wolves don't talk, but this one did, and there were such
peculiar things about him that Barty actually forgot to be
frightened.
</p><p>"How--how good are you?" he asked.
</p><p>"I am this good," the Wolf said quite solemnly. "When I see a
little boy who is a blessing and a privilege and never frets and
says he has nothing to play with, and never wriggles when his hair
is brushed, I am his Best and most Intimate Friend. But--" and his
nice voice became quite fierce and growly and he showed all his
white teeth, "when I meet a boy who is a little pig and a torment
and who makes life a burden when the tangles are taken out--I tear
him from limb to limb!"
</p><p>"I am glad I don't make life a burden," Barty said.
</p><p>"So am I," answered the Good Wolf. "I prefer to be your Intimate
Friend. Look at my ears."
</p><p>He need not have said that, because Barty had been looking at them
all the time. He had thought them very queer at first because they
were so very big and tall and pointed, and one was pink and one was
blue. But they had been growing queerer and queerer every minute
because they had been growing bigger and bigger and bigger right
before Barty's eyes.
</p><p>"Watch them," said the Good Wolf.
</p><p>He shook the pink ear. Once he shook it--twice he shook it--three
times he shook it. And out of it fell a beautiful red sled--exactly
the kind Barty had dreamed about.
</p><p>"That is for you," the Good Wolf said. "It is a present from your
Intimate Friend."
</p><p>"Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!" shouted Barty and he
danced and danced about.
</p><p>"Look again," the Good Wolf said.
</p><p>He shook the blue ear. Once he shook it--twice he shook it--three
times he shook it. And he shook out a splendid train with ever so
many cars, and a key to wind it up and make it go--exactly the kind
Barty had dreamed about.
</p><p>Barty jumped at it and knelt down in the snow.
</p><p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!" he kept saying because he could scarcely believe he
was awake.
</p><p>Then the Good Wolf shook the pink ear and pennies flew out--pennies
and pennies and pennies--just like a shower of rain; and while
Barty was scrambling about shouting for joy and picking them up,
the blue ear was shaken and a purse flew out, so that there was a
place to put the pennies in, and Barty picked up enough to stuff it
full to the brim.
</p><p>He just danced up and down.
</p><p>"What a Good Wolf you are!" he said. "I did not know any wolf could
be as good as this."
</p><p>"Ah!" said the Good Wolf. "You don't know me!"
</p><p>(When Tim's mother came to this part of the story he used to jump
up and down and laugh for joy until his face was full of dimples.)
</p><p>The Good Wolf was enjoying himself as much as Barty was. He was
smiling and smiling and wagging his tail.
</p><p>"Now," he said, "do you want to go into the forest and see the
things that build nests and the things that burrow under the ground
and make little warm caves to live in?"
</p><p>"Please yes!" Barty shouted. "Please yes!"
</p><p>Then the Good Wolf shook the pink ear. Once he shook it--twice he
shook it--three times he shook it and there flew out a beautiful
set of harness made of red leather studded with gold ornaments and
hung with tiny sleigh bells.
</p><p>That made Barty stare because he did not know what it was for.
</p><p>"It is for me," the Good Wolf said. "You must harness me to your
sled and I will draw you anywhere in the world--just anywhere."
</p><p>Barty clapped his hands and jumped up and down more than ever. He
had always wanted to be a coachman and once he dreamed that he had
a cart and horse.
</p><p>"But before you harness me," the Good Wolf said, "there is
something else to be done. If your mother were to see a wolf
galloping off into the forest with her boy she would not know he
was a Good Wolf and she would be frightened, and if we met a hunter
in the forest he would not know I was a good wolf and he would
shoot me. So I must change myself into something else."
</p><p>"Can you?" cried Barty, and his eyes grew as big as saucers, he was
so delighted.
</p><p>"Just you watch me!" said the Good Wolf.
</p><p>Once he shook himself--twice he shook himself--three times he shook
himself--and then something very funny happened. While he was
shaking himself he shook so fast that he looked as if he were
standing in a white mist. Then he stopped quite suddenly and stood
still. And actually instead of being a wolf he had changed into a
great big dog the kind of big dog that drags sleds over the snow
for the Esquimau people--but he was as white as the snow was.
</p><p>He was so furry and handsome that Barty ran to him and hung round
his neck hugging him. He had so wanted a dog and this was exactly
the kind he had dreamed about.
</p><p>"Put on my harness. Put it on!" said the Good Wolf. "I will show
you how."
</p><p>He showed him how to do it all, and when he was harnessed to the
sled and stood ready with the scarlet leather straps and gold
buckles and jingling gold bells shining out against his thick furry
white coat, he looked like a picture--so did the sled--so did Barty
in his red coat and cap, dancing up and down with his whip in his
hand.
</p><p>"Take the reins and jump on," said the Wolf.
</p><p>And Barty did take the reins and jump on, and the Good Wolf began
to trot, and the scarlet harness shone, and the bells jingled and
jingled, and off they went gliding over the sparkling snow into the
forest--the deep, deep forest where things built nests, and things
burrowed under the earth and made long passages and little warm
caves to live in.
