<P>
 IF I had been traveling homeward in my own carriage, the
remaining chapters of this narrative would never have been
written. Before we had been an hour on the road I should have
called to the driver, and should have told him to turn back.
<P>
Who can be always resolute?
<P>
In asking that question, I speak of the women, not of the men. I
had been resolute in turning a deaf ear to Mr. Playmore's doubts
and cautions; resolute in holding out against my mother-in-law;
resolute in taking my place by the French mail. Until ten minutes
after we had driven away from the inn my courage held out--and
then it failed me; then I said to myself, "You wretch, you have
deserted your husband!" For hours afterward, if I could have
stopped the mail, I would have done it. I hated the conductor,
the kindest of men. I hated the Spanish ponies that drew us, the
cheeriest animals that ever jingled a string of bells. I hated
the bright day that _would_ make things pleasant, and the bracing
air that forced me to feel the luxury of breathing whether I
liked it or not. Never was a journey more miserable than my safe
and easy journey to the frontier. But one little comfort helped
me to bear my heart-ache resignedly--a stolen morsel of Eustace's
hair. We had started at an hour of the morning when he was still
sound asleep. I could creep into his room, and kiss him, and cry
over him softly, and cut off a stray lock of his hair, without
danger of discovery. How I summoned resolution enough to leave
him is, to this hour, not clear to my mind. I think my
mother-in-law must have helped me, without meaning to do it. She
came into the room with an erect head and a cold eye; she said,
with an unmerciful emphasis on the word, "If you _mean_ to go,
Valeria, the carriage is here." Any woman with a spark of spirit
in her would have "meant" it under those circumstances. I meant
it--and did it.
<P>
And then I was sorry for it. Poor humanity! Time has got all the
credit of being the great consoler of afflicted mortals. In my
opinion, Time has been overrated in this matter. Distance does
the same beneficent work far more speedily, and (when assisted by
Change) far more effectually as well. On the railroad to Paris, I
became capable of taking a sensible view of my position. I could
now remind myself that my husband's reception of me--after the
first surprise and the first happiness had passed away--might not
have justified his mother's confidence in him. Admitting that I
ran a risk in going back to Miserrimus Dexter, should I not have
been equally rash, in another way, if I had returned, uninvited,
to a husband who had declared that our conjugal happiness was
impossible, and that our married life was at an end? Besides, who
could say that the events of the future might not y et justify
me--not only to myself, but to him? I might yet hear him say,
"She was inquisitive when she had no business to inquire; she was
obstinate when she ought; to have listened to reason; she left my
bedside when other women would have remained; but in the end she
atoned for it all--she turned out to be right!"
<P>
I rested a day at Paris and wrote three letters.
<P>
One to Benjamin, telling him to expect me the next evening. One
to Mr. Playmore, warning him, in good time, that I meant to make
a last effort to penetrate the mystery at Gleninch. One to
Eustace (of a few lines only), owning that I had helped to nurse
him through the dangerous part of his illness; confessing the one
reason which had prevailed with me to leave him; and entreating
him to suspend his opinion of me until time had proved that I
loved him more dearly than ever. This last letter I inclosed to
my mother-in-law, leaving it to her discretion to choose the
right time for giving it to her son. I positively forbade Mrs.
Macallan, however, to tell Eustace of the new tie between us.
Although he _had_ separated himself from me, I was determined
that he should not hear it from other lips than mine. Never mind
why. There are certain little matters which I must keep to
myself; and this is one of them.
<P>
My letters being written, my duty was done. I was free to play my
last card in the game--the darkly doubtful game which was neither
quite for me nor quite against me as the chances now stood.
