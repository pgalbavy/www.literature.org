<p>"Storms, do you notice that fellow?" asked Fred Sanders, as they
approached the plank.</p>

<p>"Yes; it looks odd to see him standing there so motionless, and
yet with his eyes fixed upon us."</p>

<p>"He's Weroo, the man who led that gang of pirates last night,
and he hates me with such a consuming hate that he sent out his
men to kill me, and in case they fail to do so, he has stationed
himself there with the determination to assassinate me, for he
is ready to run any risk rather than allow me to get away."</p>

<p>"Are you prepared?" asked Storms, with no little anxiety.</p>

<p>"I rather guess so! Walk ahead with Inez and leave him to me."</p>

<p>With some hesitation, Storms did as requested, though he placed
his hand on his revolver, so as to be ready for any emergency,
the crew of the <em>Albatross</em>, who were busying themselves
around, seeming to hold no suspicion of the situation.</p>

<p>Just as Captain Fred put his foot on the plank, the islander
took a short step forward, like a panther gathering himself for
the leap upon its victim. At that very instant, as if by intuition,
Captain Fred turned about and leveled his revolver at the muffled
figure, which paused. Every one who was looking on supposed, of
course, the boy was going to fire, but, though his finger pressed
the trigger, he did not discharge his weapon. With the pistol
pointed straight at the savage, Fred slowly backed up the plank,
keeping his foe covered until he himself was on the deck of the
schooner.</p>

<p>The barbarian seemed paralyzed. After taking the slight step
forward, he paused and stood motionless, staring and transfixed,
until his victim was beyond his reach. Then, without a word or
exclamation, he turned about, and strode away to where his infuriated
and discomfited comrades were watching him with not the slightest
doubt he would prevent the escape of the white boy. Within the
succeeding hour the <em>Albatross</em> was standing down the bay,
with all sail spread; and her long voyage to distant California
was begun.</p>

<p>Ah, that journey from the South Seas across the equator and northward
into the stern climate of the Temperate Zone!</p>

<p>Not one of those who participated in it can forget it to his
dying day. They had many hours of fierce, wild weather, in which
the <em>Albatross</em> was more than once in danger, but Captain
Hardy was a good sailor, he had a good crew, and he safely rode
through it all.</p>

<p>Then came those delightful nights which seem peculiar to the
Pacific, when the moonlight takes on a witchery of its own, and
the calm sea becomes like an enchanted lake as the vessel glides
over it.</p>

<p>Captain Hardy was a kind man as well as a skilful sailor, and,
since he received a most liberal price for the passage of the
three persons who joined him at Wauparmur, the best treatment
was given them.</p>

<p>It was on this homeward voyage that Captain Fred Sanders told
to Mate Storms and Inez Hawthorne the story of his life, the main
points of which have already been hinted to the reader. He ran
away from his home in San Francisco when but a mere boy, scarcely
ten years old. He was led into all sorts of evil, and was so deeply
implicated in a fierce mutiny that, as we have said, he would
have been strung up at the yard-arm, excepting for his extreme
youth.</p>

<p>He then joined a trading vessel in the South Seas, but the crew
were attacked and massacred by a band of pirates, and he was taken
off a prisoner. These pirates belonged to the Wauparmur settlement,
and they were so pleased with the bravery displayed by the boy
that they adopted him among them. There was something in the life
which was attractive to the wild American lad, and he embraced
it eagerly, and spent five years among them. His bravery, skill,
and natural "smartness," advanced him rapidly along the line of
promotion, until, while yet a boy, he became an acknowledged leader.</p>

<p>Captain Fred spent a portion of his time in the settlement, where
he showed his good sense, in one respect at least, by picking
up all the education he could from the instructors who were to
be found there. He succeeded well&mdash;which will explain the intelligence
he displayed in this respect while conversing with his friends.</p>

<p>He confessed all this, and said further that his mother died
before he ran away, and he had no idea where his father was; but,
if he were alive, the son determined to find him, no matter where
he might be on the broad earth. Now that his conscience had been
awakened, his affection came back with it, and his great fear
was that he would not see his parent alive.</p>

<p>It was a source of never-ending wonder to Fred Sanders how it
was he could have been so wicked a lad, and how it was that his
moral sense could have been so totally eclipsed for years. The
gentle, winning words of Inez Hawthorne had first aroused his
conscience, until finally it would not allow him to rest until
he had made his peace with it.</p>
