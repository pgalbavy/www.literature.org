<p>Mickey O'Rooney, fully believing the warning of the hunter, could
not but feel deeply anxious for the safety of himself and those
around him. He was particularly concerned for his young friend,
Fred Munson, who had been committed to his charge.</p>

<p>"It's myself that is the only one he has to look after him, and
if I does n't attend to my dooty, there's no telling what may
become of it, and be the same towken, I can't say what'll become
of him if I <em>does</em> attend to the same. Whisht! there."</p>

<p>The last exclamation was uttered to Caleb Barnwell, whom he approached
at that moment. The leader stepped aside a few minutes, and they
conferred together. The Irishman impressed upon the leader the
warning he had received from the hunter, and Barnwell admitted
that there might be grounds for the fear, but he added that he
was doing all he could to guard against it. At Mickey's suggestion,
he sent two of his most trustworthy men to the woods to keep watch,
while a third was stationed on some elevated ground beyond, where
he commanded an extensive view of the surrounding prairie. As
this was to be a permanent arrangement, it would seem that he
had taken all reasonable precautions. Not a suspicious sign was
seen through the day.</p>

<p>When night came, the two men were called in, and Mickey O'Rooney,
Fred Munson, and a man named Thompson went on duty. As two was
the regular number at night, it will be seen that the boy was
an extra.</p>

<p>"We're to come in at one o'clock," he said, in reply to the remonstrance
of his friend, "and I'm sure I can keep awake that long. I believe
the Indians will be around to-night, and I won't be able to sleep
if I go into the wagon."</p>

<p>Mickey had not yet learned how to refuse the boy, and so he took
him along.</p>

<p>Thompson was a powerful, stalwart man, who had joined the party
in Nebraska, and who was supposed to have considerable knowledge
of the frontier and its ways. He had proved himself a good shot,
and, on more than one occasion, had displayed such coolness and
self-possession in critical moments, that he was counted one of
the most valuable men in the entire company.</p>

<p>The sentinels were stationed on the other side of the wood, Mickey
at one corner, Thompson at another, with Fred about half way between,
something like a hundred yards separating them from each other.</p>

<p>It must be said that, so far as it was possible, Fred Munson
was furnished with every advantage that he could require. He had
a rifle suited to his size and strength, but it was one of the
best ever made, and long-continued and careful practice had made
him quite skillful in handling it. Besides this, both he and Mickey
were provided each with the fleetest and most intelligent mustang
that money could purchase, and when mounted and with a fair field
before them, they had little to fear from the pursuit of the Apaches
and Comanches.</p>

<p>But it is the Indian's treacherous, cat-like nature that makes
him so dangerous, and against his wonderful cunning all the precautions
of the white men are frequently in vain.</p>

<p>"Now, Fred," said Mickey, after they had left Thompson, as he
was on the point of leaving the boy, "I don't feel exactly aisy
'bout laving you here, as me mother used to observe when she wint
out from the house, while I remained behind with the vittles.
If one of the spalpeens should slip up and find you asleep, he'd
never let you wake up."</p>

<p>"You need n't be afraid of my going to sleep," replied Fred,
in a voice of self-confidence. "I know what the danger is too
well."</p>

<p>With a few more words they separated, and each took his station,
the Irishman somewhat consoled by the fact that from where he
stood he was able, he believed, to cover the position of the lad.</p>

<p>The moon overhead was gibbous, and there were no clouds in the
sky. Thompson's place was such that he was close to the river,
which flowed on his right, and he had that stream and the prairie
in his front at his command. Mickey O'Rooney, being upon the extreme
left, was enabled to range his eye up the valley to the crest
of the slope, so that he was confident he could detect any insidious
approach from that direction. Down the valley, on the other side
of the settlement, were placed a couple of other sentinels, so
that New Boston, on that memorable night, was well guarded.</p>

<p>The position of Fred Munson, it will be understood, was apparently
the least important, as it was commanded by the other two, but
the lad felt as if the lives of the entire company were placed
in his hands.</p>

<p>"Talk of my going to sleep," he repeated, as soon as he found
himself alone. "I can stand or sit here till daylight, and wink
less times than either Thompson or Mickey."</p>

<p>As every boy feels this way a short time before going to sleep,
no one who might have overheard Fred's boast would have been over-persuaded
thereby. Before him stretched the sloping valley of the Rio Pecos.
Glancing to the right, he could just catch the glimmer of the
river as it flowed by in the moonlight, the banks being low and
not wooded, while looking straight up the valley, his vision was
bounded only by darkness itself. Carefully running his eye over
the ground, he was confident that the slyest and most stealthy
Indian that ever lived could not approach within a hundred feet
of him without detection.</p>

<p>"And the minute I'm certain its a red-skin, that minute I'll
let him have it," he added, instinctively grasping his rifle.
"A boy need n't be as old as I am to learn that it won't do to
fool with such dogs as they are."</p>

<p>The grove which was guarded in this manner, it will be understood,
was nearly square in shape, reaching from the shore of the Rio
Pecos on toward the left until the termination of the valley in
that direction had been gained. It had been so plentifully drawn
upon for logs and lumber that here and there were spaces from
which, several trees having been cut, the moon's rays found unobstructed
entrance. One of these oasis, as they may be termed, was directly
in the rear of Fred, who noticed it while reconnoitering his position.
The open space was some twenty feet square, and was bisected by
the trunk of a large cottonwood, which had fallen directly across
it.</p>

<p>Being left entirely to himself, the boy now devoted himself to
the somewhat dismal task of keeping watch, an occupation that
cannot be classed as the most cheerful in which a man may engage.
The excitement and apprehension that marked the first two or three
hours prevented the time from hanging too heavily upon his hands,
but as the night stole along and nothing was heard or seen to
cause alarm, the fear grew less and less, until, like a boy, he
began to suspect that all these precautions were useless.</p>

<p>For the twentieth time he stood up and listened. The soft, musical
murmur of the Rio Pecos was heard, as it flowed by on his right,
and now and then the gentlest possible breath of night-wind disturbed
the branches overhead; but nothing else caught his notice. To
prevent the feeling of utter loneliness from gaining possession
of him, Fred occasionally emitted a low, soft, tremulous whistle,
which was instantly responded to from the direction of Mickey.
It was the old familiar signal which they had used many a time
when off on their little hunting expeditions, and either, hearing
it, could not mistake its source. But this grew wearisome at last,
and he leaned back against a tree, looking out upon the moonlit
valley beyond, where nothing as yet had caught his eye that looked
in the least suspicious, and where everything still appeared as
silent as a graveyard.</p>

<p>"I don't believe there are any Indians within fifty miles," he
muttered, impatiently; "and yet we must have three or four men
on the look-out till morning. Well, I s'pose it's the only safe
thing to do, and I'm bound to stick it out till one o'clock. It
must be near midnight now, and if Mickey should come around here,
an hour from now, and find me asleep, I never would hear the last
of it."</p>

<p>He felt very much like sitting down upon the ground, but he knew
if he did that he would be sure to fall asleep, while, as long
as he kept his feet, he was sure to retain his senses. When disposed
to become too drowsy, a sudden giving away at the knees recalled
him so vigorously, that it was a considerable time before the
drowsiness crept over him again.</p>

<p>Thus the night advanced, until all at once, Fred aroused himself
as if a sharp pin had been thrust in him.</p>

<p>"By George! I heard something then!" he exclaimed, in an excited
undertone, looking sharply about him; "but I don't know where
it came from."</p>

<p>His impression was that it came from some point directly before
him out on the open space; but the most rigid scrutiny failed
to reveal the cause. There was the level stretch of grass, unbroken
by stone or shrub, but nothing that could be tortured into the
remotest resemblance to a human figure.</p>

<p>"It can't be there," he muttered; "or if it was, it do n't amount&mdash;"</p>

<p>His senses were aroused to the highest pitch, and he was all
attention.</p>

<p>Just as the thoughts were running through his head, he caught
the slightest possible rustle from some point behind him. He turned
his head like lightning, and looked and listened. He could dimly
discern the open moonlit space to which reference has already
been made; but the intervening trees and undergrowth prevented
anything like a satisfactory view.</p>

<p>"There's where it seemed to come from," he said, to himself;
"and yet I do n't see how an Indian could have got there without
our finding it out. Maybe it was n't anything, after all."</p>

<p>He waited and listened awhile longer, but no more. Anxious to
learn what it all meant, he began a cautious movement toward the
open space, for the purpose of finding out.</p>
