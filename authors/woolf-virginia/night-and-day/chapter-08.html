<p>She took her letters up to her room with her, having persuaded
her mother to go to bed directly Mr. Hilbery left them, for so
long as she sat in the same room as her mother, Mrs. Hilbery might,
at any moment, ask for a sight of the post. A very hasty glance
through many sheets had shown Katharine that, by some coincidence,
her attention had to be directed to many different anxieties simultaneously.
In the first place, Rodney had written a very full account of
his state of mind, which was illustrated by a sonnet, and he demanded
a reconsideration of their position, which agitated Katharine
more than she liked. Then there were two letters which had to
be laid side by side and compared before she could make out the
truth of their story, and even when she knew the facts she could
not decide what to make of them; and finally she had to reflect
upon a great many pages from a cousin who found himself in financial
difficulties, which forced him to the uncongenial occupation of
teaching the young ladies of Bungay to play upon the violin.</p>

<p>But the two letters which each told the same story differently
were the chief source of her perplexity. She was really rather
shocked to find it definitely established that her own second
cousin, Cyril Alardyce, had lived for the last four years with
a woman who was not his wife, who had borne him two children,
and was now about to bear him another. This state of things had
been discovered by Mrs. Milvain, her aunt Celia, a zealous inquirer
into such matters, whose letter was also under consideration.
Cyril, she said, must be made to marry the woman at once; and
Cyril, rightly or wrongly, was indignant with such interference
with his affairs, and would not own that he had any cause to be
ashamed of himself. Had he any cause to be ashamed of himself,
Katharine wondered; and she turned to her aunt again.</p>

<p>"Remember," she wrote, in her profuse, emphatic statement, "that
he bears your grandfather’s name, and so will the child that is
to be born. The poor boy is not so much to blame as the woman
who deluded him, thinking him a gentleman, which he IS, and having
money, which he has <em>NOT</em>."</p>

<p>"What would Ralph Denham say to this?" thought Katharine, beginning
to pace up and down her bedroom. She twitched aside the curtains,
so that, on turning, she was faced by darkness, and looking out,
could just distinguish the branches of a plane-tree and the yellow
lights of some one else’s windows.</p>

<p>"What would Mary Datchet and Ralph Denham say?" she reflected,
pausing by the window, which, as the night was warm, she raised,
in order to feel the air upon her face, and to lose herself in
the nothingness of night. But with the air the distant humming
sound of far-off crowded thoroughfares was admitted to the room.
The incessant and tumultuous hum of the distant traffic seemed,
as she stood there, to represent the thick texture of her life,
for her life was so hemmed in with the progress of other lives
that the sound of its own advance was inaudible. People like Ralph
and Mary, she thought, had it all their own way, and an empty
space before them, and, as she envied them, she cast her mind
out to imagine an empty land where all this petty intercourse
of men and women, this life made up of the dense crossings and
entanglements of men and women, had no existence whatever. Even
now, alone, at night, looking out into the shapeless mass of London,
she was forced to remember that there was one point and here another
with which she had some connection. William Rodney, at this very
moment, was seated in a minute speck of light somewhere to the
east of her, and his mind was occupied, not with his book, but
with her. She wished that no one in the whole world would think
of her. However, there was no way of escaping from one’s fellow-beings,
she concluded, and shut the window with a sigh, and returned once
more to her letters.</p>

<p>She could not doubt but that William’s letter was the most genuine
she had yet received from him. He had come to the conclusion that
he could not live without her, he wrote. He believed that he knew
her, and could give her happiness, and that their marriage would
be unlike other marriages. Nor was the sonnet, in spite of its
accomplishment, lacking in passion, and Katharine, as she read
the pages through again, could see in what direction her feelings
ought to flow, supposing they revealed themselves. She would come
to feel a humorous sort of tenderness for him, a zealous care
for his susceptibilities, and, after all, she considered, thinking
of her father and mother, what is love?</p>

<p>Naturally, with her face, position, and background, she had experience
of young men who wished to marry her, and made protestations of
love, but, perhaps because she did not return the feeling, it
remained something of a pageant to her. Not having experience
of it herself, her mind had unconsciously occupied itself for
some years in dressing up an image of love, and the marriage that
was the outcome of love, and the man who inspired love, which
naturally dwarfed any examples that came her way. Easily, and
without correction by reason, her imagination made pictures, superb
backgrounds casting a rich though phantom light upon the facts
in the foreground. Splendid as the waters that drop with resounding
thunder from high ledges of rock, and plunge downwards into the
blue depths of night, was the presence of love she dreamt, drawing
into it every drop of the force of life, and dashing them all
asunder in the superb catastrophe in which everything was surrendered,
and nothing might be reclaimed. The man, too, was some magnanimous
hero, riding a great horse by the shore of the sea. They rode
through forests together, they galloped by the rim of the sea.
But waking, she was able to contemplate a perfectly loveless marriage,
as the thing one did actually in real life, for possibly the people
who dream thus are those who do the most prosaic things.</p>

<p>At this moment she was much inclined to sit on into the night,
spinning her light fabric of thoughts until she tired of their
futility, and went to her mathematics; but, as she knew very well,
it was necessary that she should see her father before he went
to bed. The case of Cyril Alardyce must be discussed, her mother’s
illusions and the rights of the family attended to. Being vague
herself as to what all this amounted to, she had to take counsel
with her father. She took her letters in her hand and went downstairs.
It was past eleven, and the clocks had come into their reign,
the grandfather’s clock in the hall ticking in competition with
the small clock on the landing. Mr. Hilbery’s study ran out behind
the rest of the house, on the ground floor, and was a very silent,
subterranean place, the sun in daytime casting a mere abstract
of light through a skylight upon his books and the large table,
with its spread of white papers, now illumined by a green reading-lamp.
Here Mr. Hilbery sat editing his review, or placing together documents
by means of which it could be proved that Shelley had written
"of" instead of "and," or that the inn in which Byron had slept
was called the "Nag’s Head" and not the "Turkish Knight," or that
the Christian name of Keats’s uncle had been John rather than
Richard, for he knew more minute details about these poets than
any man in England, probably, and was preparing an edition of
Shelley which scrupulously observed the poet’s system of punctuation.
He saw the humor of these researches, but that did not prevent
him from carrying them out with the utmost scrupulosity.</p>

<p>He was lying back comfortably in a deep arm-chair smoking a cigar,
and ruminating the fruitful question as to whether Coleridge had
wished to marry Dorothy Wordsworth, and what, if he had done so,
would have been the consequences to him in particular, and to
literature in general. When Katharine came in he reflected that
he knew what she had come for, and he made a pencil note before
he spoke to her. Having done this, he saw that she was reading,
and he watched her for a moment without saying anything. She was
reading "Isabella and the Pot of Basil," and her mind was full
of the Italian hills and the blue daylight, and the hedges set
with little rosettes of red and white roses. Feeling that her
father waited for her, she sighed and said, shutting her book:</p>

<p>"I’ve had a letter from Aunt Celia about Cyril, father.... It
seems to be true&mdash;about his marriage. What are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Cyril seems to have been behaving in a very foolish manner,"
said Mr. Hilbery, in his pleasant and deliberate tones.</p>

<p>Katharine found some difficulty in carrying on the conversation,
while her father balanced his finger-tips so judiciously, and
seemed to reserve so many of his thoughts for himself.</p>

<p>"He’s about done for himself, I should say," he continued. Without
saying anything, he took Katharine’s letters out of her hand,
adjusted his eyeglasses, and read them through.</p>

<p>At length he said "Humph!" and gave the letters back to her.</p>

<p>"Mother knows nothing about it," Katharine remarked. "Will you
tell her?"</p>

<p>"I shall tell your mother. But I shall tell her that there is
nothing whatever for us to do."</p>

<p>"But the marriage?" Katharine asked, with some diffidence.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery said nothing, and stared into the fire.</p>

<p>"What in the name of conscience did he do it for?" he speculated
at last, rather to himself than to her.</p>

<p>Katharine had begun to read her aunt’s letter over again, and
she now quoted a sentence. "Ibsen and Butler.... He has sent me
a letter full of quotations&mdash;nonsense, though clever nonsense."</p>

<p>"Well, if the younger generation want to carry on its life on
those lines, it’s none of our affair," he remarked.</p>

<p>"But isn’t it our affair, perhaps, to make them get married?"
Katharine asked rather wearily.</p>

<p>"Why the dickens should they apply to me?" her father demanded
with sudden irritation.</p>

<p>"Only as the head of the family&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I’m not the head of the family. Alfred’s the head of the
family. Let them apply to Alfred," said Mr. Hilbery, relapsing
again into his arm-chair. Katharine was aware that she had touched
a sensitive spot, however, in mentioning the family.</p>

<p>"I think, perhaps, the best thing would be for me to go and see
them,"  she observed.</p>

<p>"I won’t have you going anywhere near them," Mr. Hilbery replied
with unwonted decision and authority. "Indeed, I don’t understand
why they’ve dragged you into the business at all &mdash;I don’t
see that it’s got anything to do with you."</p>

<p>"I’ve always been friends with Cyril," Katharine observed.</p>

<p>"But did he ever tell you anything about this?" Mr. Hilbery asked
rather sharply.</p>

<p>Katharine shook her head. She was, indeed, a good deal hurt that
Cyril had not confided in her&mdash;did he think, as Ralph Denham or
Mary Datchet might think, that she was, for some reason, unsympathetic&mdash;hostile
even?</p>

<p>"As to your mother," said Mr. Hilbery, after a pause, in which
he seemed to be considering the color of the flames, "you had
better tell her the facts. She’d better know the facts before
every one begins to talk about it, though why Aunt Celia thinks
it necessary to come, I’m sure I don’t know. And the less talk
there is the better."</p>

<p>Granting the assumption that gentlemen of sixty who are highly
cultivated, and have had much experience of life, probably think
of many things which they do not say, Katharine could not help
feeling rather puzzled by her father’s attitude, as she went back
to her room. What a distance he was from it all! How superficially
he smoothed these events into a semblance of decency which harmonized
with his own view of life! He never wondered what Cyril had felt,
nor did the hidden aspects of the case tempt him to examine into
them. He merely seemed to realize, rather languidly, that Cyril
had behaved in a way which was foolish, because other people did
not behave in that way. He seemed to be looking through a telescope
at little figures hundreds of miles in the distance.</p>

<p>Her selfish anxiety not to have to tell Mrs. Hilbery what had
happened made her follow her father into the hall after breakfast
the next morning in order to question him.</p>

<p>"Have you told mother?" she asked. Her manner to her father was
almost stern, and she seemed to hold endless depths of reflection
in the dark of her eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery sighed.</p>

<p>"My dear child, it went out of my head." He smoothed his silk
hat energetically, and at once affected an air of hurry. "I’ll
send a note round from the office.... I’m late this morning, and
I’ve any amount of proofs to get through."</p>

<p>"That wouldn’t do at all," Katharine said decidedly. "She must
be told&mdash;you or I must tell her. We ought to have told her at
first."</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery had now placed his hat on his head, and his hand
was on the door-knob. An expression which Katharine knew well
from her childhood, when he asked her to shield him in some neglect
of duty, came into his eyes; malice, humor, and irresponsibility
were blended in it. He nodded his head to and fro significantly,
opened the door with an adroit movement, and stepped out with
a lightness unexpected at his age. He waved his hand once to his
daughter, and was gone. Left alone, Katharine could not help laughing
to find herself cheated as usual in domestic bargainings with
her father, and left to do the disagreeable work which belonged,
by rights, to him.</p>
