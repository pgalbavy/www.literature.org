<p>I spent the night on a shelf of the hillside, in the lee of a
boulder where the heather grew long and soft. It was a cold business,
for I had neither coat nor waistcoat. These were in Mr Turnbull’s
keeping, as was Scudder’s little book, my watch and—worst of all—my
pipe and tobacco pouch. Only my money accompanied me in my belt,
and about half a pound of ginger biscuits in my trousers pocket.</p>

<p>I supped off half those biscuits, and by worming myself deep
into the heather got some kind of warmth. My spirits had risen,
and I was beginning to enjoy this crazy game of hide-and-seek.
So far I had been miraculously lucky. The milkman, the literary
innkeeper, Sir Harry, the roadman, and the idiotic Marmie, were
all pieces of undeserved good fortune. Somehow the first success
gave me a feeling that I was going to pull the thing through.</p>

<p>My chief trouble was that I was desperately hungry. When a Jew
shoots himself in the City and there is an inquest, the newspapers
usually report that the deceased was "well-nourished". I remember
thinking that they would not call me well-nourished if I broke
my neck in a bog-hole. I lay and tortured myself—for the ginger
biscuits merely emphasized the aching void—with the memory of
all the good food I had thought so little of in London. There
were Paddock’s crisp sausages and fragrant shavings of bacon,
and shapely poached eggs—how often I had turned up my nose at
them! There were the cutlets they did at the club, and a particular
ham that stood on the cold table, for which my soul lusted. My
thoughts hovered over all varieties of mortal edible, and finally
settled on a porterhouse steak and a quart of bitter with a welsh
rabbit to follow. In longing hopelessly for these dainties I fell
asleep.</p>

<p>I woke very cold and stiff about an hour after dawn. It took
me a little while to remember where I was, for I had been very
weary and had slept heavily. I saw first the pale blue sky through
a net of heather, then a big shoulder of hill, and then my own
boots placed neatly in a blaeberry bush. I raised myself on my
arms and looked down into the valley, and that one look set me
lacing up my boots in mad haste.</p>

<p>For there were men below, not more than a quarter of a mile off,
spaced out on the hillside like a fan, and beating the heather.
Marmie had not been slow in looking for his revenge.</p>

<p>I crawled out of my shelf into the cover of a boulder, and from
it gained a shallow trench which slanted up the mountain face.
This led me presently into the narrow gully of a burn, by way
of which I scrambled to the top of the ridge. From there I looked
back, and saw that I was still undiscovered. My pursuers were
patiently quartering the hillside and moving upwards.</p>

<p>Keeping behind the skyline I ran for maybe half a mile, till
I judged I was above the uppermost end of the glen. Then I showed
myself, and was instantly noted by one of the flankers, who passed
the word to the others. I heard cries coming up from below, and
saw that the line of search had changed its direction. I pretended
to retreat over the skyline, but instead went back the way I had
come, and in twenty minutes was behind the ridge overlooking my
sleeping place. From that viewpoint I had the satisfaction of
seeing the pursuit streaming up the hill at the top of the glen
on a hopelessly false scent.</p>

<p>I had before me a choice of routes, and I chose a ridge which
made an angle with the one I was on, and so would soon put a deep
glen between me and my enemies. The exercise had warmed my blood,
and I was beginning to enjoy myself amazingly. As I went I breakfasted
on the dusty remnants of the ginger biscuits.</p>

<p>I knew very little about the country, and I hadn’t a notion what
I was going to do. I trusted to the strength of my legs, but I
was well aware that those behind me would be familiar with the
lie of the land, and that my ignorance would be a heavy handicap.
I saw in front of me a sea of hills, rising very high towards
the south, but northwards breaking down into broad ridges which
separated wide and shallow dales. The ridge I had chosen seemed
to sink after a mile or two to a moor which lay like a pocket
in the uplands. That seemed as good a direction to take as any
other.</p>

<p>My stratagem had given me a fair start—call it twenty minutes—and
I had the width of a glen behind me before I saw the first heads
of the pursuers. The police had evidently called in local talent
to their aid, and the men I could see had the appearance of herds
or gamekeepers. They hallooed at the sight of me, and I waved
my hand. Two dived into the glen and began to climb my ridge,
while the others kept their own side of the hill. I felt as if
I were taking part in a schoolboy game of hare and hounds.</p>

<p>But very soon it began to seem less of a game. Those fellows
behind were hefty men on their native heath. Looking back I saw
that only three were following direct, and I guessed that the
others had fetched a circuit to cut me off. My lack of local knowledge
might very well be my undoing, and I resolved to get out of this
tangle of glens to the pocket of moor I had seen from the tops.
I must so increase my distance as to get clear away from them,
and I believed I could do this if I could find the right ground
for it. If there had been cover I would have tried a bit of stalking,
but on these bare slopes you could see a fly a mile off. My hope
must be in the length of my legs and the soundness of my wind,
but I needed easier ground for that, for I was not bred a mountaineer.
How I longed for a good Afrikander pony!</p>

<p>I put on a great spurt and got off my ridge and down into the
moor before any figures appeared on the skyline behind me. I crossed
a burn, and came out on a highroad which made a pass between two
glens. All in front of me was a big field of heather sloping up
to a crest which was crowned with an odd feather of trees. In
the dyke by the roadside was a gate, from which a grass-grown
track led over the first wave of the moor.</p>

<p>I jumped the dyke and followed it, and after a few hundred yards—as
soon as it was out of sight of the highway—the grass stopped and
it became a very respectable road, which was evidently kept with
some care. Clearly it ran to a house, and I began to think of
doing the same. Hitherto my luck had held, and it might be that
my best chance would be found in this remote dwelling. Anyhow
there were trees there, and that meant cover.</p>

<p>I did not follow the road, but the burnside which flanked it
on the right, where the bracken grew deep and the high banks made
a tolerable screen. It was well I did so, for no sooner had I
gained the hollow than, looking back, I saw the pursuit topping
the ridge from which I had descended.</p>

<p>After that I did not look back; I had no time. I ran up the burnside,
crawling over the open places, and for a large part wading in
the shallow stream. I found a deserted cottage with a row of phantom
peat-stacks and an overgrown garden. Then I was among young hay,
and very soon had come to the edge of a plantation of wind-blown
firs. From there I saw the chimneys of the house smoking a few
hundred yards to my left. I forsook the burnside, crossed another
dyke, and almost before I knew was on a rough lawn. A glance back
told me that I was well out of sight of the pursuit, which had
not yet passed the first lift of the moor.</p>

<p>The lawn was a very rough place, cut with a scythe instead of
a mower, and planted with beds of scrubby rhododendrons. A brace
of black-game, which are not usually garden birds, rose at my
approach. The house before me was the ordinary moorland farm,
with a more pretentious whitewashed wing added. Attached to this
wing was a glass veranda, and through the glass I saw the face
of an elderly gentleman meekly watching me.</p>

<p>I stalked over the border of coarse hill gravel and entered the
open veranda door. Within was a pleasant room, glass on one side,
and on the other a mass of books. More books showed in an inner
room. On the floor, instead of tables, stood cases such as you
see in a museum, filled with coins and queer stone implements.</p>

<p>There was a knee-hole desk in the middle, and seated at it, with
some papers and open volumes before him, was the benevolent old
gentleman. His face was round and shiny, like Mr Pickwick’s, big
glasses were stuck on the end of his nose, and the top of his
head was as bright and bare as a glass bottle. He never moved
when I entered, but raised his placid eyebrows and waited on me
to speak.</p>

<p>It was not an easy job, with about five minutes to spare, to
tell a stranger who I was and what I wanted, and to win his aid.
I did not attempt it. There was something about the eye of the
man before me, something so keen and knowledgeable, that I could
not find a word. I simply stared at him and stuttered.</p>

<p>"You seem in a hurry, my friend," he said slowly.</p>

<p>I nodded towards the window. It gave a prospect across the moor
through a gap in the plantation, and revealed certain figures
half a mile off straggling through the heather.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," he said, and took up a pair of field-glasses through
which he patiently scrutinized the figures.</p>

<p>"A fugitive from justice, eh? Well, we’ll go into the matter
at our leisure. Meantime I object to my privacy being broken in
upon by the clumsy rural policeman. Go into my study, and you
will see two doors facing you. Take the one on the left and close
it behind you. You will be perfectly safe."</p>

<p>And this extraordinary man took up his pen again.</p>

<p>I did as I was bid, and found myself in a little dark chamber
which smelt of chemicals, and was lit only by a tiny window high
up in the wall. The door had swung behind me with a click like
the door of a safe. Once again I had found an unexpected sanctuary.</p>

<p>All the same I was not comfortable. There was something about
the old gentleman which puzzled and rather terrified me. He had
been too easy and ready, almost as if he had expected me. And
his eyes had been horribly intelligent.</p>

<p>No sound came to me in that dark place. For all I knew the police
might be searching the house, and if they did they would want
to know what was behind this door. I tried to possess my soul
in patience, and to forget how hungry I was.</p>

<p>Then I took a more cheerful view. The old gentleman could scarcely
refuse me a meal, and I fell to reconstructing my breakfast. Bacon
and eggs would content me, but I wanted the better part of a flitch
of bacon and half a hundred eggs. And then, while my mouth was
watering in anticipation, there was a click and the door stood
open.</p>

<p>I emerged into the sunlight to find the master of the house sitting
in a deep armchair in the room he called his study, and regarding
me with curious eyes.</p>

<p>"Have they gone?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They have gone. I convinced them that you had crossed the hill.
I do not choose that the police should come between me and one
whom I am delighted to honour. This is a lucky morning for you,
Mr Richard Hannay."</p>

<p>As he spoke his eyelids seemed to tremble and to fall a little
over his keen grey eyes. In a flash the phrase of Scudder’s came
back to me, when he had described the man he most dreaded in the
world. He had said that he "could hood his eyes like a hawk".
Then I saw that I had walked straight into the enemy’s headquarters.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to throttle the old ruffian and make for
the open air. He seemed to anticipate my intention, for he smiled
gently, and nodded to the door behind me. I turned, and saw two
men-servants who had me covered with pistols.</p>

<p>He knew my name, but he had never seen me before. And as the
reflection darted across my mind I saw a slender chance.</p>

<p>"I don’t know what you mean," I said roughly. "And who are you
calling Richard Hannay? My name’s Ainslie."</p>

<p>"So?" he said, still smiling. "But of course you have others.
We won’t quarrel about a name."</p>

<p>I was pulling myself together now, and I reflected that my garb,
lacking coat and waistcoat and collar, would at any rate not betray
me. I put on my surliest face and shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>"I suppose you’re going to give me up after all, and I call it
a damned dirty trick. My God, I wish I had never seen that cursed
motor-car! Here’s the money and be damned to you," and I flung
four sovereigns on the table.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes a little. "Oh no, I shall not give you up.
My friends and I will have a little private settlement with you,
that is all. You know a little too much, Mr Hannay. You are a
clever actor, but not quite clever enough."</p>

<p>He spoke with assurance, but I could see the dawning of a doubt
in his mind.</p>

<p>"Oh, for God’s sake stop jawing," I cried. "Everything’s against
me. I haven’t had a bit of luck since I came on shore at Leith.
What’s the harm in a poor devil with an empty stomach picking
up some money he finds in a bust-up motor-car? That’s all I done,
and for that I’ve been chivvied for two days by those blasted
bobbies over those blasted hills. I tell you I’m fair sick of
it. You can do what you like, old boy! Ned Ainslie’s got no fight
left in him."</p>

<p>I could see that the doubt was gaining.</p>

<p>"Will you oblige me with the story of your recent doings?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I can’t, guv’nor," I said in a real beggar’s whine. "I’ve not
had a bite to eat for two days. Give me a mouthful of food, and
then you’ll hear God’s truth."</p>

<p>I must have showed my hunger in my face, for he signalled to
one of the men in the doorway. A bit of cold pie was brought and
a glass of beer, and I wolfed them down like a pig—or rather,
like Ned Ainslie, for I was keeping up my character. In the middle
of my meal he spoke suddenly to me in German, but I turned on
him a face as blank as a stone wall.</p>

<p>Then I told him my story—how I had come off an Archangel ship
at Leith a week ago, and was making my way overland to my brother
at Wigtown. I had run short of cash—I hinted vaguely at a spree—and
I was pretty well on my uppers when I had come on a hole in a
hedge, and, looking through, had seen a big motor-car lying in
the burn. I had poked about to see what had happened, and had
found three sovereigns lying on the seat and one on the floor.
There was nobody there or any sign of an owner, so I had pocketed
the cash. But somehow the law had got after me. When I had tried
to change a sovereign in a baker’s shop, the woman had cried on
the police, and a little later, when I was washing my face in
a burn, I had been nearly gripped, and had only got away by leaving
my coat and waistcoat behind me.</p>

<p>"They can have the money back," I cried, "for a fat lot of good
it’s done me. Those perishers are all down on a poor man. Now,
if it had been you, guv’nor, that had found the quids, nobody
would have troubled you."</p>

<p>"You’re a good liar, Hannay," he said.</p>

<p>I flew into a rage. "Stop fooling, damn you! I tell you my name’s
Ainslie, and I never heard of anyone called Hannay in my born
days. I’d sooner have the police than you with your Hannays and
your monkey-faced pistol tricks.... No, guv’nor, I beg pardon,
I don’t mean that. I’m much obliged to you for the grub, and I’ll
thank you to let me go now the coast’s clear."</p>

<p>It was obvious that he was badly puzzled. You see he had never
seen me, and my appearance must have altered considerably from
my photographs, if he had got one of them. I was pretty smart
and well dressed in London, and now I was a regular tramp.</p>

<p>"I do not propose to let you go. If you are what you say you
are, you will soon have a chance of clearing yourself. If you
are what I believe you are, I do not think you will see the light
much longer."</p>

<p>He rang a bell, and a third servant appeared from the veranda.</p>

<p>"I want the Lanchester in five minutes," he said. "There will
be three to luncheon."</p>

<p>Then he looked steadily at me, and that was the hardest ordeal
of all.</p>

<p>There was something weird and devilish in those eyes, cold, malignant,
unearthly, and most hellishly clever. They fascinated me like
the bright eyes of a snake. I had a strong impulse to throw myself
on his mercy and offer to join his side, and if you consider the
way I felt about the whole thing you will see that that impulse
must have been purely physical, the weakness of a brain mesmerized
and mastered by a stronger spirit. But I managed to stick it out
and even to grin.</p>

<p>"You’ll know me next time, guv’nor," I said.</p>

<p>"Karl," he spoke in German to one of the men in the doorway,
"you will put this fellow in the storeroom till I return, and
you will be answerable to me for his keeping."</p>

<p>I was marched out of the room with a pistol at each ear.</p>

<p>The storeroom was a damp chamber in what had been the old farmhouse.
There was no carpet on the uneven floor, and nothing to sit down
on but a school form. It was black as pitch, for the windows were
heavily shuttered. I made out by groping that the walls were lined
with boxes and barrels and sacks of some heavy stuff. The whole
place smelt of mould and disuse. My gaolers turned the key in
the door, and I could hear them shifting their feet as they stood
on guard outside.</p>

<p>I sat down in that chilly darkness in a very miserable frame
of mind. The old boy had gone off in a motor to collect the two
ruffians who had interviewed me yesterday. Now, they had seen
me as the roadman, and they would remember me, for I was in the
same rig. What was a roadman doing twenty miles from his beat,
pursued by the police? A question or two would put them on the
track. Probably they had seen Mr Turnbull, probably Marmie too;
most likely they could link me up with Sir Harry, and then the
whole thing would be crystal clear. What chance had I in this
moorland house with three desperadoes and their armed servants?</p>

<p>I began to think wistfully of the police, now plodding over the
hills after my wraith. They at any rate were fellow-countrymen
and honest men, and their tender mercies would be kinder than
these ghoulish aliens. But they wouldn’t have listened to me.
That old devil with the eyelids had not taken long to get rid
of them. I thought he probably had some kind of graft with the
constabulary. Most likely he had letters from Cabinet Ministers
saying he was to be given every facility for plotting against
Britain. That’s the sort of owlish way we run our politics in
this jolly old country.</p>

<p>The three would be back for lunch, so I hadn’t more than a couple
of hours to wait. It was simply waiting on destruction, for I
could see no way out of this mess. I wished that I had Scudder’s
courage, for I am free to confess I didn’t feel any great fortitude.
The only thing that kept me going was that I was pretty furious.
It made me boil with rage to think of those three spies getting
the pull on me like this. I hoped that at any rate I might be
able to twist one of their necks before they downed me.</p>

<p>The more I thought of it the angrier I grew, and I had to get
up and move about the room. I tried the shutters, but they were
the kind that lock with a key, and I couldn’t move them. From
the outside came the faint clucking of hens in the warm sun. Then
I groped among the sacks and boxes. I couldn’t open the latter,
and the sacks seemed to be full of things like dog-biscuits that
smelt of cinnamon. But, as I circumnavigated the room, I found
a handle in the wall which seemed worth investigating.</p>

<p>It was the door of a wall cupboard—what they call a "press" in
Scotland—and it was locked. I shook it, and it seemed rather flimsy.
For want of something better to do I put out my strength on that
door, getting some purchase on the handle by looping my braces
round it. Presently the thing gave with a crash which I thought
would bring in my warders to inquire. I waited for a bit, and
then started to explore the cupboard shelves.</p>

<p>There was a multitude of queer things there. I found an odd vesta
or two in my trouser pockets and struck a light. It was out in
a second, but it showed me one thing. There was a little stock
of electric torches on one shelf. I picked up one, and found it
was in working order.</p>

<p>With the torch to help me I investigated further. There were
bottles and cases of queer-smelling stuffs, chemicals no doubt
for experiments, and there were coils of fine copper wire and
yanks and yanks of thin oiled silk. There was a box of detonators,
and a lot of cord for fuses. Then away at the back of the shelf
I found a stout brown cardboard box, and inside it a wooden case.
I managed to wrench it open, and within lay half a dozen little
grey bricks, each a couple of inches square.</p>

<p>I took up one, and found that it crumbled easily in my hand.
Then I smelt it and put my tongue to it. After that I sat down
to think. I hadn’t been a mining engineer for nothing, and I knew
lentonite when I saw it.</p>

<p>With one of these bricks I could blow the house to smithereens.
I had used the stuff in Rhodesia and knew its power. But the trouble
was that my knowledge wasn’t exact. I had forgotten the proper
charge and the right way of preparing it, and I wasn’t sure about
the timing. I had only a vague notion, too, as to its power, for
though I had used it I had not handled it with my own fingers.</p>

<p>But it was a chance, the only possible chance. It was a mighty
risk, but against it was an absolute black certainty. If I used
it the odds were, as I reckoned, about five to one in favour of
my blowing myself into the tree-tops; but if I didn’t I should
very likely be occupying a six-foot hole in the garden by the
evening. That was the way I had to look at it. The prospect was
pretty dark either way, but anyhow there was a chance, both for
myself and for my country.</p>

<p>The remembrance of little Scudder decided me. It was about the
beastliest moment of my life, for I’m no good at these cold-blooded
resolutions. Still I managed to rake up the pluck to set my teeth
and choke back the horrid doubts that flooded in on me. I simply
shut off my mind and pretended I was doing an experiment as simple
as Guy Fawkes fireworks.</p>

<p>I got a detonator, and fixed it to a couple of feet of fuse.
Then I took a quarter of a lentonite brick, and buried it near
the door below one of the sacks in a crack of the floor, fixing
the detonator in it. For all I knew half those boxes might be
dynamite. If the cupboard held such deadly explosives, why not
the boxes? In that case there would be a glorious skyward journey
for me and the German servants and about an acre of surrounding
country. There was also the risk that the detonation might set
off the other bricks in the cupboard, for I had forgotten most
that I knew about lentonite. But it didn’t do to begin thinking
about the possibilities. The odds were horrible, but I had to
take them.</p>

<p>I ensconced myself just below the sill of the window, and lit
the fuse. Then I waited for a moment or two. There was dead silence—only
a shuffle of heavy boots in the passage, and the peaceful cluck
of hens from the warm out-of-doors. I commended my soul to my
Maker, and wondered where I would be in five seconds....</p>

<p>A great wave of heat seemed to surge upwards from the floor,
and hang for a blistering instant in the air. Then the wall opposite
me flashed into a golden yellow and dissolved with a rending thunder
that hammered my brain into a pulp. Something dropped on me, catching
the point of my left shoulder.</p>

<p>And then I think I became unconscious.</p>

<p>My stupor can scarcely have lasted beyond a few seconds. I felt
myself being choked by thick yellow fumes, and struggled out of
the debris to my feet. Somewhere behind me I felt fresh air. The
jambs of the window had fallen, and through the ragged rent the
smoke was pouring out to the summer noon. I stepped over the broken
lintel, and found myself standing in a yard in a dense and acrid
fog. I felt very sick and ill, but I could move my limbs, and
I staggered blindly forward away from the house.</p>

<p>A small mill-lade ran in a wooden aqueduct at the other side
of the yard, and into this I fell. The cool water revived me,
and I had just enough wits left to think of escape. I squirmed
up the lade among the slippery green slime till I reached the
mill-wheel. Then I wriggled through the axle hole into the old
mill and tumbled on to a bed of chaff. A nail caught the seat
of my trousers, and I left a wisp of heather-mixture behind me.</p>

<p>The mill had been long out of use. The ladders were rotten with
age, and in the loft the rats had gnawed great holes in the floor.
Nausea shook me, and a wheel in my head kept turning, while my
left shoulder and arm seemed to be stricken with the palsy. I
looked out of the window and saw a fog still hanging over the
house and smoke escaping from an upper window. Please God I had
set the place on fire, for I could hear confused cries coming
from the other side.</p>

<p>But I had no time to linger, since this mill was obviously a
bad hiding-place. Anyone looking for me would naturally follow
the lade, and I made certain the search would begin as soon as
they found that my body was not in the storeroom. From another
window I saw that on the far side of the mill stood an old stone
dovecot. If I could get there without leaving tracks I might find
a hiding-place, for I argued that my enemies, if they thought
I could move, would conclude I had made for open country, and
would go seeking me on the moor.</p>

<p>I crawled down the broken ladder, scattering chaff behind me
to cover my footsteps. I did the same on the mill floor, and on
the threshold where the door hung on broken hinges. Peeping out,
I saw that between me and the dovecot was a piece of bare cobbled
ground, where no footmarks would show. Also it was mercifully
hid by the mill buildings from any view from the house. I slipped
across the space, got to the back of the dovecot and prospected
a way of ascent.</p>

<p>That was one of the hardest jobs I ever took on. My shoulder
and arm ached like hell, and I was so sick and giddy that I was
always on the verge of falling. But I managed it somehow. By the
use of out-jutting stones and gaps in the masonry and a tough
ivy root I got to the top in the end. There was a little parapet
behind which I found space to lie down. Then I proceeded to go
off into an old-fashioned swoon.</p>

<p>I woke with a burning head and the sun glaring in my face. For
a long time I lay motionless, for those horrible fumes seemed
to have loosened my joints and dulled my brain. Sounds came to
me from the house—men speaking throatily and the throbbing of
a stationary car. There was a little gap in the parapet to which
I wriggled, and from which I had some sort of prospect of the
yard. I saw figures come out—a servant with his head bound up,
and then a younger man in knickerbockers. They were looking for
something, and moved towards the mill. Then one of them caught
sight of the wisp of cloth on the nail, and cried out to the other.
They both went back to the house, and brought two more to look
at it. I saw the rotund figure of my late captor, and I thought
I made out the man with the lisp. I noticed that all had pistols.</p>

<p>For half an hour they ransacked the mill. I could hear them kicking
over the barrels and pulling up the rotten planking. Then they
came outside, and stood just below the dovecot arguing fiercely.
The servant with the bandage was being soundly rated. I heard
them fiddling with the door of the dovecote and for one horrid
moment I fancied they were coming up. Then they thought better
of it, and went back to the house.</p>

<p>All that long blistering afternoon I lay baking on the rooftop.
Thirst was my chief torment. My tongue was like a stick, and to
make it worse I could hear the cool drip of water from the mill-lade.
I watched the course of the little stream as it came in from the
moor, and my fancy followed it to the top of the glen, where it
must issue from an icy fountain fringed with cool ferns and mosses.
I would have given a thousand pounds to plunge my face into that.</p>

<p>I had a fine prospect of the whole ring of moorland. I saw the
car speed away with two occupants, and a man on a hill pony riding
east. I judged they were looking for me, and I wished them joy
of their quest.</p>

<p>But I saw something else more interesting. The house stood almost
on the summit of a swell of moorland which crowned a sort of plateau,
and there was no higher point nearer than the big hills six miles
off. The actual summit, as I have mentioned, was a biggish clump
of trees—firs mostly, with a few ashes and beeches. On the dovecot
I was almost on a level with the tree-tops, and could see what
lay beyond. The wood was not solid, but only a ring, and inside
was an oval of green turf, for all the world like a big cricket-field.</p>

<p>I didn’t take long to guess what it was. It was an aerodrome,
and a secret one. The place had been most cunningly chosen. For
suppose anyone were watching an aeroplane descending here, he
would think it had gone over the hill beyond the trees. As the
place was on the top of a rise in the midst of a big amphitheatre,
any observer from any direction would conclude it had passed out
of view behind the hill. Only a man very close at hand would realize
that the aeroplane had not gone over but had descended in the
midst of the wood. An observer with a telescope on one of the
higher hills might have discovered the truth, but only herds went
there, and herds do not carry spy-glasses. When I looked from
the dovecot I could see far away a blue line which I knew was
the sea, and I grew furious to think that our enemies had this
secret conning-tower to rake our waterways.</p>

<p>Then I reflected that if that aeroplane came back the chances
were ten to one that I would be discovered. So through the afternoon
I lay and prayed for the coming of darkness, and glad I was when
the sun went down over the big western hills and the twilight
haze crept over the moor. The aeroplane was late. The gloaming
was far advanced when I heard the beat of wings and saw it volplaning
downward to its home in the wood. Lights twinkled for a bit and
there was much coming and going from the house. Then the dark
fell, and silence.</p>

<p>Thank God it was a black night. The moon was well on its last
quarter and would not rise till late. My thirst was too great
to allow me to tarry, so about nine o’clock, so far as I could
judge, I started to descend. It wasn’t easy, and half-way down
I heard the back door of the house open, and saw the gleam of
a lantern against the mill wall. For some agonizing minutes I
hung by the ivy and prayed that whoever it was would not come
round by the dovecot. Then the light disappeared, and I dropped
as softly as I could on to the hard soil of the yard.</p>

<p>I crawled on my belly in the lee of a stone dyke till I reached
the fringe of trees which surrounded the house. If I had known
how to do it I would have tried to put that aeroplane out of action,
but I realized that any attempt would probably be futile. I was
pretty certain that there would be some kind of defence round
the house, so I went through the wood on hands and knees, feeling
carefully every inch before me. It was as well, for presently
I came on a wire about two feet from the ground. If I had tripped
over that, it would doubtless have rung some bell in the house
and I would have been captured.</p>

<p>A hundred yards farther on I found another wire cunningly placed
on the edge of a small stream. Beyond that lay the moor, and in
five minutes I was deep in bracken and heather. Soon I was round
the shoulder of the rise, in the little glen from which the mill-lade
flowed. Ten minutes later my face was in the spring, and I was
soaking down pints of the blessed water.</p>

<p>But I did not stop till I had put half a dozen miles between
me and that accursed dwelling.</p>
