<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A small boy crept into the darkened hut. The unglazed windows
were roughly curtained with skins, but there was sufficient light
from the open doorway to show him what he wanted. He tiptoed to
a corner where an old travelling trunk lay under a pile of dirty
clothes. He opened it very carefully, and after a little searching
found the thing he sought. Then he gently closed it, and, with
a look towards the bed in the other corner, he slipped out again
into the warm October afternoon.</p>

<p>The woman on the bed stirred uneasily and suddenly became fully
awake, after the way of those who are fluttering very near death.
She was still young, and the little face among the coarse homespun
blankets looked almost childish. Heavy masses of black hair lay
on the pillow, and the depth of its darkness increased the pallor
of her brow. But the cheeks were flushed, and the deep hazel eyes
were burning with a slow fire.... For a week the milk-sick fever
had raged furiously, and in the few hours free from delirium she
had been racked with omnipresent pain and deadly sickness. Now
those had gone, and she was drifting out to sea on a tide of utter
weakness. Her husband, Tom Linkhorn, thought she mending, and
was even now whistling&mdash;the first time for weeks&mdash;by the woodpile.
But the woman knew that she was close to the great change, and
so deep was her weariness that the knowledge remained an instinct
rather than a thought. She was as passive as a dying animal. The
cabin was built of logs, mortised into each other&mdash;triangular
in shape, with a fireplace in one corner. Beside the fire stood
a table made of a hewn log, on which lay some pewter dishes containing
the remains of the last family meal. One or two three-legged stools
made up the rest of the furniture, except for the trunk in the
corner and the bed. This bed was Tom Linkhorn's pride, which he
used to boast about to his friends, for he was a tolerable carpenter.
It was made of plank stuck between the logs of the wall, and supported
at the other end by crotched sticks. By way of a curtain top a
hickory post had been sunk in the floor and bent over the bed,
the end being fixed in the log wall. Tom meant to have a fine
skin curtain fastened to it when winter came. The floor was of
beaten earth, but there was a rough ceiling of smaller logs, with
a trap in it which could be reached by pegs stuck the centre post.
In that garret the children slept. Tom's building zeal had come
to an end with the bed. Some day he meant to fit in a door and
windows, but these luxuries could wait till he got his clearing
in better order.</p>

<p>On a stool by the bed stood a wooden bowl containing gruel. The
woman had not eaten for days, and the stuff had a thick scum on
it. The place was very stuffy, for it was a hot and sickly autumn
day and skins which darkened the window holes kept out the little
freshness that was in the air. Beside the gruel was a tin pannikin
of cold water which the boy Abe fetched every hour from the spring.
She saw the water, but was too weak to reach it.</p>

<p>The shining doorway was blocked by a man's entrance. Tom Linkhorn
was a little over middle height, with long muscular arms, and
the corded neck sinews which tell of great strength. He had a
shock of coarse black hair, grey eyes and a tired sallow face,
as of one habitually overworked and underfed. His jaw was heavy,
but loosely put together, so that he presented an air of weakness
and irresolution. His lips were thick and pursed in a kind of
weary good humour. He wore an old skin shirt and a pair of towlinen
pants, which flapped about his bare brown ankles. A fine sawdust
coated his hair and shoulders, for he had been working in the
shed where he eked out his farming by making spinning wheels for
his neighbours.</p>

<p>He came softly to the bedside and looked down at his wife. His
face was gentle and puzzled.</p>

<p>"Reckon you're better, dearie," he said in a curious harsh toneless
voice.</p>

<p>The sick woman moved her head feebly in the direction of the
stool and he lifted the pannikin of water to her lips.</p>

<p>"Cold enough?" he asked, and his wife nodded. "Abe fetches it
as reg'lar as a clock."</p>

<p>"Where's Abe?" she asked, and her voice for all its feebleness
had a youthful music in it.</p>

<p>"I heerd him sayin' he was goin' down to the crick to cotch a
fish. He reckoned you'd fancy a fish when you could eat a piece.
He's a mighty thoughtful boy, our Abe. Then he was comin' to read
to you. You'd like that, dearie?"</p>

<p>The sick woman made no sign. Her eyes were vacantly regarding
the doorway.</p>

<p>"I've got to leave you now. I reckon I'll borrow the Dawneys'
sorrel horse and ride into Gentryville. I've got the young hogs
to sell, and I'll fetch back the corn-meal from Hickson's. Sally
Hickson was just like you last fall, and I want to find out from
Jim how she got her strength up."</p>

<p>He put a hand on her brow, and felt it cool.</p>

<p>"Glory! You're mendin' fast, Nancy gal. You'll be well in time
to can the berries that the childern's picked." He fished from
below the bed a pair of skin brogues and slipped them on his feet.
"I'll be back before night."</p>

<p>"I want Abe," she moaned.</p>

<p>"I'll send him to you," he said as he went out</p>

<p>Left alone the woman lay still for a little in a stupor of weariness.
Waves of that terrible lassitude, which is a positive anguish
and not a mere absence of strength, flowed over her. The square
of the doorway, which was directly before her eyes, began to take
strange forms. It was filled with yellow sunlight, and a red glow
beyond told of the sugar-maples at the edge of the clearing. Now
it seemed to her unquiet sight to be a furnace. Outside the world
was burning; she could feel the heat of it in the close cabin.
For a second acute fear startled her weakness. It passed, her
eyes cleared, and she saw the homely doorway as it was, and heard
the gobble of a turkey in the forest.</p>

<p>The fright had awakened her mind and senses. For the first time
she fully realised her condition. Life no longer moved steadily
in her body; it flickered and wavered and would soon gutter out....
Her eyes marked every detail of the squalor around her&mdash;the unwashed
dishes, the foul earthen floor, the rotting apple pile, the heap
of rags which had been her only clothes. She was leaving the world,
and this was all she had won from it. Sheer misery forced a sigh
which seemed to rend her frail body, and her eyes filled with
tears. She had been a dreamer, an adept at make-believe, but the
poor coverings she had wrought for a dingy reality were now too
threadbare to hide it.</p>

<p>And once she had been so rich in hope. She would make her husband
a great man, and&mdash;when that was manifestly impossible without
a rebirth of Tom Linkhorn&mdash;she would have a son who would wear
a black coat like Lawyer Macneil and Colonel Hardin way back in
Kentucky, and make fine speeches beginning "Fellow countrymen
and gentlemen of this famous State." She had a passion for words,
and sonorous phrases haunted her memory. She herself would have
a silk gown and a bonnet with roses in it; once long ago she had
been to Elizabethtown and seen just such a gown and bonnet....
Or Tom would be successful in this wild Indiana country and be,
like Daniel Boone, the father of a new State, and have places
and towns called for him&mdash;a Nancyville perhaps or a Linkhorn County.
She knew about Daniel Boone, for her grandfather Hanks had been
with him.... And there had been other dreams, older dreams, dating
far back to the days when she was a little girl with eyes like
a brown owl. Someone had told her fairy-tales about princesses
and knights, strange beings which she never quite understood,
but of which she made marvellous pictures in her head She had
learned to read in order to follow up the doings of those queer
bright folk, but she had never tracked them down again. But one
book she had got called The Pilgrim's Progress, printed by missionaries
in a far-away city called Philadelphia, which told of things as
marvellous, and had pictures, too&mdash;one especially of a young man
covered with tin, which she supposed was what they called armour.
And there was another called The Arabian Nights, a close-printed
thing difficult to read by the winter fire, full of wilder doings
than any she could imagine for herself; but beautiful, too, and
delicious to muse over, though Tom, when she read a chapter to
him, had condemned it as a pack of lies.... Clearly there was
a world somewhere, perhaps outside America altogether, far more
wonderful than even the magnificence of Colonel Hardin. Once she
had hoped to find it herself; then that her children should find
it. And the end was this shack in the wilderness, a few acres
of rotting crops, bitter starving winters, summers of fever, the
deeps of poverty, a penniless futureless family, and for herself
a coffin of green lumber and a yard or two of stony soil.</p>

<p>She saw everything now with the clear unrelenting eyes of childhood.
The films she had woven for selfprotection were blown aside. She
was dying&mdash;she had often wondered how she should feel when dying&mdash;humble
and trustful, she had hoped, for she was religious after a fashion,
and had dreamed herself into an affection for a kind fatherly
God. But now all that had gone. She was bitter, like one defrauded.
She had been promised something, and had struggled on in the assurance
of it. And the result was nothing&mdash;nothing. Tragic tears filled
her eyes. She had been so hungry, and there was to be no satisfying
that hunger this side the grave or beyond it. She was going the
same way as Betsy Sparrow, a death like a cow's, with nothing
to show for life, nothing to leave. Betsy had been a poor crushed
creature, and had looked for no more. But she was different. She
had been promised something, something fine&mdash;she couldn't remember
what, or who had promised it, but it had never been out of her
mind.</p>

<p>There was the ring, too. No woman in Indiana had the like of
that. An ugly thing, but very ancient and of pure gold. Once Tom
had wanted to sell it when he was hard-pressed back at Nolin Creek,
but she had fought for it like a tigress and scared the life out
of Tom. Her grandfather had left it her because she was his favourite
and it had been her grandmothers, and long ago had come from Europe.
It was lucky, and could cure rheumatism if worn next the heart
in a skin bag.... All her thoughts were suddenly set on the ring,
her one poor shred of fortune. She wanted to feel it on her finger,
and press its cool gold with the queer markings on her eyelids.</p>

<p>But Tom had gone away and she couldn't reach the trunk in the
corner. Tears trickled down her cheeks and through the mist of
them she saw that the boy Abe stood at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>"Feelin' comfortabler?" he asked. He had a harsh untunable voice,
his father's, but harsher, and he spoke the drawling dialect of
the backwoods.</p>

<p>His figure stood in the light, so that the dying mother saw only
its outline. He was a boy about nine years old, but growing too
fast, so that he had lost the grace of childhood and was already
lanky and ungainly. As he turned his face crosswise to the light
he revealed a curiously rugged profile&mdash;a big nose springing sharply
from the brow, a thick underhung lower lip, and the beginning
of a promising Adam's apple. His stiff black hair fell round his
great ears, which stood out like the handles of a pitcher. He
was barefoot, and wore a pair of leather breeches and a ragged
homespun shirt. Beyond doubt he was ugly.</p>

<p>He moved round to the right side of the bed where he was wholly
in shadow.</p>

<p>"My lines is settin' nicely," he said. "I'll have a fish for
your supper. And then I'm goin' to take dad's gun and fetch you
a turkey. You could eat a slice of a fat turkey, I reckon."</p>

<p>The woman did not answer, for she was thinking. This uncouth
boy was the son she had put her faith in. She loved him best of
all things on earth, but for the moment she saw him in the hard
light of disillusionment. A loutish backwoods child, like Dennis
Hanks or Tom Sparrow or anybody else. He had been a comfort to
her, for he had been quick to learn and had a strange womanish
tenderness in his ways. But she was leaving him, and he would
grow up like his father before him to a life of ceaseless toil
with no daylight or honour in it.... She almost hated the sight
of him, for he was the memorial of her failure.</p>

<p>The boy did not guess these thoughts. He pulled up a stool and
sat very close to the bed, holding his mother's frail wrist in
a sunburnt hand so big that it might have been that of a lad half-way
through his teens. He had learned in the woods to be neat and
precise in his ways, and his movements, for all his gawky look,
were as soft as a panther's.</p>

<p>"Like me to tell you a story?" he asked. "What about Uncle Mord's
tale of Dan'l Boone at the Blue Licks Battle?"</p>

<p>There was no response, so he tried again.</p>

<p>"Or read a piece? It was the Bible last time, but the words is
mighty difficult. Besides you don't need it that much now. You're
gettin' better.... Let's hear about the ol' Pilgrim."</p>

<p>He found a squat duodecimo in the trunk, and shifted the skin
curtain from one of the window holes to get light to read by.
His mother lay very still with her eyes shut, but he knew by her
breathing that she was not asleep. He ranged through the book,
stopping to study the crude pictures, and then started laboriously
to read the adventures of Christian and Hopeful after leaving
Vanity Fair&mdash;the mine of Demas, the plain called Ease, Castle
Doubting, and the Delectable Mountains. He boggled over some of
the words, but on the whole he read well, and his harsh voice
dropped into a pleasant sing-song.</p>

<p>By and by he noticed that his mother was asleep. He took the
tin pannikin and filled it with fresh water from the spring. Then
he kissed the hand which lay on the blanket, looked about guiltily
to see if anyone had seen him, for kisses were rare in that household
and tiptoed out again.</p>

<p>The woman slept, but not wholly. The doorway, which was now filled
with the deeper gold of the westering sun, was still in her vision.
It had grown to a great square of light, and instead of being
blocked in the foreground by the forest it seemed to give on an
infinite distance. She had a sense not of looking out of a hut,
but of looking from without into a great chamber. Peace descended
on her which she had never known before in her feverish dreams,
peace and a happy expectation.</p>

<p>She had not listened to Abe's reading, but some words of it had
caught her ear. The phrase "delectable mountains" for one. She
did not know what "delectable" meant, but it sounded good; and
mountains, though she had never seen more of them than a far blue
line, had always pleased her fancy. Now she seemed to be looking
at them through that magical doorway.... The country was not like
anything she remembered in the Kentucky bluegrass, still less
like the shaggy woods of Indiana. The turf was short and very
green, and the hills fell into gracious folds that promised homesteads
in every nook of them. It was a "delectable"  country&mdash;yes, that
was the meaning of the word that had puzzled her.... She had seen
the picture before in her head. She remembered one hot Sunday
afternoon when she was a child hearing a Baptist preacher discoursing
on a Psalm, something about the "little hills rejoicing."  She
had liked the words and made a picture in her mind. These were
the little hills and they were joyful.</p>

<p>There was a white road running straight through them till it
disappeared over a crest. That was right, of course. The road
which the Pilgrims travelled.... And there, too, was a Pilgrim.</p>

<p>He was a long way off, but she could see him quite clearly. He
was a boy, older than Abe, but about the same size&mdash;a somewhat
forlorn figure, who seemed as if he had a great way to go and
was oppressed by the knowledge of it. He had funny things on his
legs and feet, which were not proper moccasins. Once he looked
back, and she had a glimpse of fair hair. He could not be any
of the Hanks or Linkhorn kin, for they were all dark.... But he
had something on his left arm which she recognised&mdash;a thick ring
of gold. It was her own ring, the ring she kept in the trunk and
she smiled comfortably. She had wanted it a little while ago,
and now there it was before her eyes. She had no anxiety about
its safety, for somehow it belonged to that little boy as well
as to her.</p>

<p>His figure moved fast and was soon out of sight round a turn
of the hill. And with that the landscape framed in the doorway
began to waver and dislimn. The road was still there, white and
purposeful, but the environs were changing.... She was puzzled,
but with a pleasant confusion. Her mind was not on the landscape,
but on the people, for she was assured that others would soon
appear on the enchanted stage.</p>

<p>He ran across the road, shouting with joy, a dog at his heels
and a bow in his hand. Before he disappeared she marked the ring,
this time on his finger.... He had scarcely gone ere another appeared
on the road, a slim pale child, dressed in some stuff that gleamed
like satin, and mounted on a pony.... The spectacle delighted
her, for it brought her in mind of the princes she had been told
of in fairytales. And there was the ring, worn over a saffron
riding glove....</p>

<p>A sudden weakness made her swoon; and out of it she woke to a
consciousness of the hut where she lay. She had thought she was
dead and in heaven among fair children, and the waking made her
long for her own child. Surely that was Abe in the doorway....
No, it was a taller and older lad, oddly dressed, but he had a
look of Abe&mdash;something in his eyes. He was on the road too, and
marching purposefully&mdash;and he had the ring. Even in her mortal
frailty she had a quickening of the heart. These strange people
had something to do with her, something to tell her, and that
something was about her son....</p>

<p>There was a new boy in the picture. A dejected child who rubbed
the ring on his small breeches and played with it, looking up
now and then with a frightened start. The woman's heart ached
for him, for she knew her own life-long malady. He was hungry
for something which he had small hope of finding.... And then
a wind seemed to blow out-of-doors and the world darkened down
to evening. But her eyes pierced the gloaming easily, and she
saw very plain the figure of a man.</p>

<p>He was sitting hunched up, with his chin in his hands, gazing
into vacancy. Without surprise she recognised something in his
face that was her own. He wore the kind of hunter's clothes that
old folk had worn in her childhood, and a long gun lay across
his knees. His air was sombre and wistful, and yet with a kind
of noble content in it. He had Abe's puckered-up lips and Abe's
steady sad eyes.... Into her memory came a verse of the Scriptures
which had always fascinated her. "These all died in faith, not
having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and
were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that
they were strangers and pilgrims upon the earth."</p>

<p>She saw it all in a flash of enlightenment. These seekers throughout
the ages had been looking for something and had not found it.
But Abe, her son, was to find it. That was why she had been shown
those pictures.</p>

<p>Once again she looked through the door into bright sunshine.
It was a place that she knew beside the Ohio she remembered the
tall poplar clump. She did not see the Jacksons' farm which stood
south of the trees, but there was the Indian graveyard, which
as a little girl she had been afraid to pass. Now it seemed to
be fresh made, for painted vermilion wands stood about the mounds.
On one of them was a gold trinket, tied by a loop of hide, rattled
in the wind. It was her ring. The seeker lay buried there with
the talisman above him.</p>

<p>She was awake now, oblivious of the swift sinking of her vital
energy. She must have the ring, for it was the pledge of a great
glory....</p>

<p>A breathless little girl flung herself into the cabin. It was
Sophy Hanks, one of the many nieces who squattered like ducks
about the settlement.</p>

<p>"Mammy!" she cried shrilly. "Mammy Linkorn!" She stammered with
the excitement of the bearer of ill news. "Abe's lost your ring
in the crick. He took it for a sinker to his lines, for Indian
Jake telled him a piece of gold would cotch the grit fish. And
a grit fish has cotched it. Abe's bin divn' and divn' and can't
find it nohow. He reckons it's plumb lost.  Ain't he a bad 'un,
Mammy Linkhorn?"</p>

<p>It was some time before the dying woman understood. Then she
began feebly to cry. For the moment her ring loomed large in her
eyes: it was the earnest of the promise, and without it the promise
might fail. She had not strength to speak or even to sob, and
the tears trickled over her cheeks in dumb impotent misery.</p>

<p>She was roused by the culprit Abe. He stood beside her with his
wet hair streaked into a fringe along his brow. The skin of his
neck glistened wet in the opening of his shirt. His cheeks too
glistened, but not with the water of the creek. He was crying
bitterly.</p>

<p>He had no words of explanation or defence. His thick underlip
stuck out and gave him the appeal of a penitent dog; the tears
had furrowed paler channels down grimy cheeks; he was the very
incarnation of uncouth misery.</p>

<p>But his mother saw none of these things.... On the instant he
seemed to her transfigured. Something she saw in him of all the
generations of pleading boys that had passed before her, something
of the stern confidence of the man over whose grave the ring had
fluttered. But more&mdash;far more. She was assured that the day of
the seekers had passed and that the finder had come.... The young
features were transformed into the lines of a man's strength.
The eyes dreamed but also commanded, the loose mouth had the gold
of wisdom and the steel of resolution. The promise had not failed
her.... She had won everything from life, for she had given the
world a master. Words seemed to speak themselves in her ear...
"Bethink you of the blessedness. Every wife is like the Mother
of God and has the hope of bearing a saviour of mankind."</p>

<p>She lay very still in her great joy. The boy in a fright sprang
to her side, knocking over the stool with the pannikin of water.
He knelt on the floor and hid his face in the bed-clothes. Her
hand found his shaggy head.</p>

<p>Her voice was very faint now, but he heard it.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, little Abe," she said. "Don't you worry about the
ring, dearie. It ain't needed no more."</p>

<p>Half an hour later, when the cabin door was dim with twilight,
the hand which the boy held grew cold.</p>
