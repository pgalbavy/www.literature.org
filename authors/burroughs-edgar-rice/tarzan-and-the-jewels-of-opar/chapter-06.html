After their first terror had subsided subsequent to the
shock of the earthquake, Basuli and his warriors
hastened back into the passageway in search of Tarzan
and two of their own number who were also missing.
<P>
They found the way blocked by jammed and distorted
rock.  For two days they labored to tear a way through
to their imprisoned friends; but when, after Herculean
efforts, they had unearthed but a few yards of the
choked passage, and discovered the mangled remains of
one of their fellows they were forced to the conclusion
that Tarzan and the second Waziri also lay dead beneath
the rock mass farther in, beyond human aid, and no
longer susceptible of it.
<P>
Again and again as they labored they called aloud the
names of their master and their comrade; but no
answering call rewarded their listening ears.  At last
they gave up the search.  Tearfully they cast a last
look at the shattered tomb of their master, shouldered
the heavy burden of gold that would at least furnish
comfort, if not happiness, to their bereaved and
beloved mistress, and made their mournful way back
across the desolate valley of Opar, and downward
through the forests beyond toward the distant bungalow.
<P>
And as they marched what sorry fate was already drawing
down upon that peaceful, happy home!
<P>
From the north came Achmet Zek, riding to the summons
of his lieutenant's letter.  With him came his horde of
renegade Arabs, outlawed marauders, these, and equally
degraded blacks, garnered from the more debased and
ignorant tribes of savage cannibals through whose
countries the raider passed to and fro with perfect
impunity.
<P>
Mugambi, the ebon Hercules, who had shared the dangers
and vicissitudes of his beloved Bwana, from Jungle
Island, almost to the headwaters of the Ugambi,
was the first to note the bold approach of the
sinister caravan.
<P>
He it was whom Tarzan had left in charge of the
warriors who remained to guard Lady Greystoke, nor
could a braver or more loyal guardian have been found
in any clime or upon any soil.  A giant in stature,
a savage, fearless warrior, the huge black possessed also
soul and judgment in proportion to his bulk and his ferocity.
<P>
Not once since his master had departed had he been
beyond sight or sound of the bungalow, except when Lady
Greystoke chose to canter across the broad plain, or
relieve the monotony of her loneliness by a brief
hunting excursion.  On such occasions Mugambi, mounted
upon a wiry Arab, had ridden close at her horse's
heels.
<P>
The raiders were still a long way off when the
warrior's keen eyes discovered them.  For a time he
stood scrutinizing the advancing party in silence,
then he turned and ran rapidly in the direction of the
native huts which lay a few hundred yards below the bungalow.
<P>
Here he called out to the lolling warriors.  He issued
orders rapidly.  In compliance with them the men seized
upon their weapons and their shields.  Some ran to call
in the workers from the fields and to warn the tenders
of the flocks and herds.  The majority followed Mugambi
back toward the bungalow.
<P>
The dust of the raiders was still a long distance away.
Mugambi could not know positively that it hid an enemy;
but he had spent a lifetime of savage life in savage
Africa, and he had seen parties before come thus
unheralded.  Sometimes they had come in peace and
sometimes they had come in war--one could never tell.
It was well to be prepared.  Mugambi did not like the
haste with which the strangers advanced.
<P>
The Greystoke bungalow was not well adapted for
defense.  No palisade surrounded it, for, situated as
it was, in the heart of loyal Waziri, its master had
anticipated no possibility of an attack in force by any
enemy.  Heavy, wooden shutters there were to close the
window apertures against hostile arrows, and these
Mugambi was engaged in lowering when Lady Greystoke
appeared upon the veranda.
<P>
"Why, Mugambi!" she exclaimed.  "What has happened?
Why are you lowering the shutters?"
<P>
Mugambi pointed out across the plain to where a white-robed
force of mounted men was now distinctly visible.
<P>
"Arabs," he explained.  "They come for no good purpose
in the absence of the Great Bwana."
<P>
Beyond the neat lawn and the flowering shrubs, Jane
Clayton saw the glistening bodies of her Waziri.
The sun glanced from the tips of their metal-shod spears,
picked out the gorgeous colors in the feathers of their
war bonnets, and reflected the high-lights from the
glossy skins of their broad shoulders and high cheek bones.
<P>
Jane Clayton surveyed them with unmixed feelings of
pride and affection.  What harm could befall her with
such as these to protect her?
<P>
The raiders had halted now, a hundred yards out upon
the plain.  Mugambi had hastened down to join his
warriors.  He advanced a few yards before them and
raising his voice hailed the strangers.  Achmet Zek sat
straight in his saddle before his henchmen.
<P>
"Arab!" cried Mugambi.  "What do you here?"
<P>
"We come in peace," Achmet Zek called back.
<P>
"Then turn and go in peace," replied Mugambi.
"We do not want you here.  There can be no peace between
Arab and Waziri."
<P>
Mugambi, although not born in Waziri, had been adopted
into the tribe, which now contained no member more
jealous of its traditions and its prowess than he.
<P>
Achmet Zek drew to one side of his horde, speaking to
his men in a low voice.  A moment later, without
warning, a ragged volley was poured into the ranks of
the Waziri.  A couple of warriors fell, the others were
for charging the attackers; but Mugambi was a cautious
as well as a brave leader.  He knew the futility of
charging mounted men armed with muskets.  He withdrew
his force behind the shrubbery of the garden.  Some he
dispatched to various other parts of the grounds
surrounding the bungalow.  Half a dozen he sent to the
bungalow itself with instructions to keep their
mistress within doors, and to protect her with their lives.
<P>
Adopting the tactics of the desert fighters from which
he had sprung, Achmet Zek led his followers at a gallop
in a long, thin line, describing a great circle which
drew closer and closer in toward the defenders.
<P>
At that part of the circle closest to the Waziri,
a constant fusillade of shots was poured into the bushes
behind which the black warriors had concealed
themselves.  The latter, on their part, loosed their
slim shafts at the nearest of the enemy.
<P>
The Waziri, justly famed for their archery, found no
cause to blush for their performance that day.
Time and again some swarthy horseman threw hands above
his head and toppled from his saddle, pierced by a
deadly arrow; but the contest was uneven.  The Arabs
outnumbered the Waziri; their bullets penetrated the
shrubbery and found marks that the Arab riflemen had
not even seen; and then Achmet Zek circled inward a
half mile above the bungalow, tore down a section of
the fence, and led his marauders within the grounds.
<P>
Across the fields they charged at a mad run.  Not again
did they pause to lower fences, instead, they drove
their wild mounts straight for them, clearing the
obstacles as lightly as winged gulls.
<P>
Mugambi saw them coming, and, calling those of his
warriors who remained, ran for the bungalow and the
last stand.  Upon the veranda Lady Greystoke stood,
rifle in hand.  More than a single raider had accounted
to her steady nerves and cool aim for his outlawry;
more than a single pony raced, riderless, in the wake
of the charging horde.
<P>
Mugambi pushed his mistress back into the greater
security of the interior, and with his depleted force
prepared to make a last stand against the foe.
<P>
On came the Arabs, shouting and waving their long guns
above their heads.  Past the veranda they raced,
pouring a deadly fire into the kneeling Waziri who
discharged their volley of arrows from behind their
long, oval shields--shields well adapted, perhaps,
to stop a hostile arrow, or deflect a spear; but futile,
quite, before the leaden missiles of the riflemen.
<P>
From beneath the half-raised shutters of the bungalow
other bowmen did effective service in greater security,
and after the first assault, Mugambi withdrew his
entire force within the building.
<P>
Again and again the Arabs charged, at last forming a
stationary circle about the little fortress, and
outside the effective range of the defenders' arrows.
From their new position they fired at will at the
windows.  One by one the Waziri fell.  Fewer and fewer
were the arrows that replied to the guns of the
raiders, and at last Achmet Zek felt safe in ordering
an assault.
<P>
Firing as they ran, the bloodthirsty horde raced for
the veranda.  A dozen of them fell to the arrows of the
defenders; but the majority reached the door.
Heavy gun butts fell upon it.  The crash of splintered
wood mingled with the report of a rifle as Jane Clayton
fired through the panels upon the relentless foe.
<P>
Upon both sides of the door men fell; but at last the
frail barrier gave to the vicious assaults of the
maddened attackers; it crumpled inward and a dozen
swarthy murderers leaped into the living-room.
At the far end stood Jane Clayton surrounded by the remnant
of her devoted guardians.  The floor was covered by the
bodies of those who already had given up their lives in
her defense.  In the forefront of her protectors stood
the giant Mugambi.  The Arabs raised their rifles to
pour in the last volley that would effectually end all
resistance; but Achmet Zek roared out a warning order
that stayed their trigger fingers.
<P>
"Fire not upon the woman!" he cried.  "Who harms her,
dies.  Take the woman alive!"
<P>
The Arabs rushed across the room; the Waziri met them
with their heavy spears.  Swords flashed, long-barreled
pistols roared out their sullen death dooms.  Mugambi
launched his spear at the nearest of the enemy with a
force that drove the heavy shaft completely through the
Arab's body, then he seized a pistol from another, and
grasping it by the barrel brained all who forced their
way too near his mistress.
<P>
Emulating his example the few warriors who remained to
him fought like demons; but one by one they fell, until
only Mugambi remained to defend the life and honor of
the ape-man's mate.
<P>
From across the room Achmet Zek watched the unequal
struggle and urged on his minions.  In his hands was a
jeweled musket.  Slowly he raised it to his shoulder,
waiting until another move should place Mugambi at his
mercy without endangering the lives of the woman or any
of his own followers.
<P>
At last the moment came, and Achmet Zek pulled the
trigger.  Without a sound the brave Mugambi sank to the
floor at the feet of Jane Clayton.
<P>
An instant later she was surrounded and disarmed.
Without a word they dragged her from the bungalow.
A giant Negro lifted her to the pommel of his saddle,
and while the raiders searched the bungalow and outhouses
for plunder he rode with her beyond the gates and
waited the coming of his master.
<P>
Jane Clayton saw the raiders lead the horses from the
corral, and drive the herds in from the fields.
She saw her home plundered of all that represented
intrinsic worth in the eyes of the Arabs, and then she saw
the torch applied, and the flames lick up what remained.
<P>
And at last, when the raiders assembled after glutting
their fury and their avarice, and rode away with her
toward the north, she saw the smoke and the flames
rising far into the heavens until the winding of the trail
into the thick forests hid the sad view from her eyes.
<P>
As the flames ate their way into the living-room,
reaching out forked tongues to lick up the bodies of
the dead, one of that gruesome company whose bloody
welterings had long since been stilled, moved again.
It was a huge black who rolled over upon his side and
opened blood-shot, suffering eyes.  Mugambi, whom the
Arabs had left for dead, still lived.  The hot flames
were almost upon him as he raised himself painfully
upon his hands and knees and crawled slowly toward the
doorway.
<P>
Again and again he sank weakly to the floor; but each
time he rose again and continued his pitiful way toward
safety.  After what seemed to him an interminable time,
during which the flames had become a veritable fiery
furnace at the far side of the room, the great black
managed to reach the veranda, roll down the steps,
and crawl off into the cool safety of some nearby
shrubbery.
<P>
All night he lay there, alternately unconscious and
painfully sentient; and in the latter state watching
with savage hatred the lurid flames which still rose
from burning crib and hay cock.  A prowling lion roared
close at hand; but the giant black was unafraid.  There
was place for but a single thought in his savage mind--
revenge!  revenge!  revenge!
