<p>Perhaps, the same futile vanity that led Mr. Bellton to import the
latest sartorial novelties from the <u>Rue de la Paix</u> for the adornment
of his person made him fond of providing foreign notables to give
color to his entertainments.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bellton was at heart the <u>poseur</u>, but he was also the fighter.
Even when he carried the war of political reform into sections of the
town where the lawless elements had marked him for violence, he went
stubbornly in the conspicuousness of ultra-tailoring. Though he loved
to address the proletariat in the name of brotherhood, he loved with a
deeper passion the exclusiveness of presiding as host at a board where
his guests included the "best people."
</p><p>Señor Ribero, who at home used the more ear-filling entitlement of
Señor Don Ricardo de Ribero y Pierola, was hardly a notable, yet he
was a new type, and, even before the ladies had emerged from their
cloak-room and while the men were apart in the grill, the host felt
that he had secured a successful ingredient for his mixture of
personal elements.
</p><p>After the fashion of Latin-American diplomacy, educated in Paris and
polished by great latitude of travel, the attaché had the art of small
talk and the charm of story-telling. To these recommendations, he
added a slender, almost military carriage, and the distinction of
Castilian features.
</p><p>A punctured tire had interrupted the homeward journey of Steele and
Saxon, who had telephoned to beg that the dinner go on, without
permitting their tardiness to delay the more punctual.
</p><p>The table was spread in a front room with a balcony that gave an
outlook across the broad lawn and the ancient trees which bordered the
sidewalk. At the open windows, the May air that stirred the curtains
was warm enough to suggest summer, and new enough after the lately
banished winter to seem wonderful--as though the rebirth of nature had
wrought its miracle for the first time.
</p><p>Ribero was the only guest who needed presentation, and, as he bowed
over the hand of each woman, it was with an almost ornate
ceremoniousness of manner.
</p><p>Duska Filson, after the spontaneous system of her opinions and
prejudices, disliked the South American. To her imaginative mind,
there was something in his jetlike darkness and his quick, almost
tigerish movements that suggested the satanic. But, if the impression
she received was not flattering to the guest, the impression she made
was evidently profound. Ribero glanced at her with an expression of
extreme admiration, and dropped his dark lashes as though he would
veil eyes from which he could not hope to banish flattery too fulsome
for new acquaintanceship.
</p><p>The girl found herself seated with the diplomat at her right, and a
vacant chair at her left. The second vacant seat was across the round
table, and she found herself sensible of a feeling of quarantine with
an uncongenial companion, and wondering who would fill the empty space
at her left. The name on the place card was hidden. She rather hoped
it would be Saxon. She meant to ask him why he did not break away
from the Marston influence that handicapped his career, and she
believed he would entertain her. Of course, George Steele was an old
friend and a very dear one, but this was just the point: he was not
satisfied with that, and in the guise of lovers only did she ever find
men uninteresting. It would, however, be better to have George make
love than to be forced to talk to this somewhat pompous foreigner.
</p><p>"I just met and made obeisance to the new Mrs. Billie Bedford,"
declared Mr. Bellton, starting the conversational ball rolling along
the well-worn groove of gossip. "And, if she needs a witness, she may
call on me to testify that she's as radiant in the part of Mrs. Billie
as she was in her former rôle of Mrs. Jack."
</p><p>Miss Buford raised her large eyes. With a winter's popularity behind
her, she felt aggrieved to hear mentioned names that she did not know.
Surely, she had met everybody.
</p><p>"Who is Mrs. Bedford?" she demanded. "I don't think I have ever met
her. Is she a widow?"
</p><p>Bellton laughed across his consommé cup. "Of the modern school," he
enlightened. "There were 'no funeral baked meats to furnish forth the
marriage feast.' Matrimonially speaking, this charming lady plays in
repertoire."
</p><p>"What has become of Jack Spotswood?" The older Miss Preston glanced up
inquiringly. "He used to be everywhere, and I haven't heard of him for
ages."
</p><p>"He's still everywhere," responded Mr. Bellton, with energy;
"everywhere but here. You see, the papers were so busy with Jack's
affairs that they crowded Jack out of his own life." Mr. Bellton
smiled as he added: "And so he went away."
</p><p>"I wonder where he is now. He wasn't such a bad sort," testified Mr.
Cleaver, solemnly. "Jack's worse portion was his better half."
</p><p>"Last heard," informed Mr. Bellton, "he was seen in some town in South
America--the name of which I forget."
</p><p>Señor Ribero had no passport of familiarity into local personalities,
and he occupied the moment of his own conversational disengagement in
a covert study of the face and figure beside him. Just now, the girl
was looking away at the indolently stirring curtains with an
expression of detachment. Flippant gossip was distasteful to her, and,
when the current set that way, she drew aside, and became the
non-participant.
</p><p>Ribero read rightly the bored expression, and resolved that the topic
must be diverted, if Miss Filson so wished.
</p><p>"One meets so many of your countrymen in South America," he suggested,
"that one might reasonably expect them to lose interest as types, yet
each of them seems to be the center of some gripping interest. I
remember in particular one episode--"
</p><p>The recital was cut short by the entrance of Steele and Saxon. Ribero,
the only person present requiring introduction, rose to shake hands.
</p><p>[Illustration: {Saxon and Ribero meet}]
</p><p>The attaché was trained in diplomacy, and the rudiments of diplomacy
should teach the face to become a mask when need be, yet, as his eyes
met those of Saxon, he suddenly and involuntarily stiffened. For just
a moment, his outstretched hand hesitated with the impulse to draw
back. The lips that had parted in a casual smile hardened rigidly, and
the eyes that rested on the face of Steele's celebrity were so
intently focused that they almost stared. The byplay occupied only a
moment, and, as Ribero had half-turned from the table to greet those
entering at his back, it escaped the notice of everyone except Saxon
himself. The newcomer felt the momentary bar of hostility that had
been thrown between them and as quickly withdrawn. The next moment, he
was shaking the extended hand, and hearing the commonplace:
</p><p>"Much pleased, señor."
</p><p>Ribero felt a momentary flash of shame for the betrayal of such
undiplomatic surprise, and made amends with added courtesy when he
spoke.
</p><p>The artist, dropping into his seat at the side of Miss Filson, felt a
flush of pleasure at his position. For the instant, the other man's
conduct became a matter of negligible importance, and, when she turned
to him with a friendly nod and smile, he forgot Ribero's existence.
</p><p>"Mr. Ribero," announced Mr. Bellton, "was just about to tell us an
interesting story when you two delinquents came in. I'm sure he still
has the floor."
</p><p>The diplomat had forgotten what he had been saying. He was covertly
studying the features of the man just beyond Miss Filson. The face was
turned toward the girl, giving him a full view, and it was a steady,
imperturbable face. Now, introduced as raconteur, he realized that he
must say something, and at the moment, with a flash of inspiration, he
determined to relate a bit of history that would be of interest at
least to the narrator. It was not at all the story he might have told
had he been uninterrupted, but it was a story that appealed to his
diplomatic taste, because he could watch the other face as he told it
and see what the other face might betray. This newcomer had jarred him
from his usual poise. Now, he fancied it was the other's turn to be
startled.
</p><p>"It was," he said casually, "the narrowest escape from death that I
have seen--and the man who escaped was an American."
</p><p>As Saxon raised his eyes, with polite interest, to those of the
speaker, he became aware that they held for him a message of almost
sardonic challenge. He felt that the story-teller was only ostensibly
addressing the table; that the man was talking at him, as a prosecutor
talks at the defendant though he may direct himself to the jury. The
sense that brought this realization was perhaps telepathic. To the
other eyes and ears, there were only the manner of the raconteur and
the impersonal tone of generality.
</p><p>"It occurred in Puerto Frio," said the South American, reminiscently.
He paused for a moment, and smiled at Saxon, as though expecting a
sign of confusion upon the mention of the name, but he read only
courteous interest and impenetrability.
</p><p>"This countryman of yours," he went on smoothly, his English touched
and softened by the accent of the foreigner, "had indulged in the
dangerous, though it would seem alluring, pastime of promoting a
revolution. Despite his unscrupulous character, he was possessed of an
engaging personality, and, on brief acquaintance, I, for one, liked
him. His skill and luck held good so long that it was only when the
insurgents were at the gates of the capital that a summary
court-martial gave him the verdict of death. I have no doubt that by
the laws of war it was a just award, yet so many men are guilty of
peddling revolutions, and the demand for such wares is so great in
some quarters, that he had my sympathy." The speaker bowed slightly,
as though conceding a point to a gallant adversary. It chanced that he
was looking directly at Saxon as he bowed.
</p><p>The painter became suddenly conscious that he was according an
engrossed attention, and that the story-teller was narrowly watching
his fingers as they twisted the stem of his sauterne glass. The
fingers became at once motionless.
</p><p>"He bore himself so undeniably well when he went out to his place
against a blank wall in the plaza, escorted by the firing squad,"
proceeded Señor Ribero evenly, "that one could not withhold
admiration. The picture remains with me. The sun on the yellow
cathedral wall ... a vine heavy with scarlet blossoms like splashes of
blood ... and twenty paces away the firing squad with their Mausers."
</p><p>Once more, the speaker broke off, as though lost in retrospection of
something well-remembered. Beyond the girl's absorbed gaze, he saw
that of the painter, and his dark eyes for an instant glittered with
something like direct accusation.
</p><p>"As they arranged the final details, he must have reflected somewhat
grimly on the irony of things, for at that very moment he could hear
the staccato popping of the guns he had smuggled past the vigilance of
the customs. The sound was coming nearer--telling him that in a
half-hour his friends would be victorious--too late to save him."
</p><p>As Ribero paused, little Miss Buford, leaning forward across the
table, gave a sort of gasp.
</p><p>"He was tall, athletic, gray-eyed," announced the attaché
irrelevantly; "in his eyes dwelt something of the spirit of the
dreamer. He never faltered."
</p><p>The speaker lifted his sauterne glass to his lips, and sipped the wine
deliberately.
</p><p>"The <u>teniente</u> in command inquired if he wished to pray," Ribero
added then, "but he shook his head almost savagely. 'No, damn you!' he
snapped out, as though he were in a hurry about it all, 'Go on with
your rat-killing. Let's have it over with.'"
</p><p>The raconteur halted in his narrative.
</p><p>"Please go on," begged Duska, in a low voice. "What happened?"
</p><p>The foreigner smiled.
</p><p>"They fired." Then, as he saw the slight shudder of Duska's white
shoulder, he supplemented: "But each soldier had left the task for the
others.... Possibly, they sympathized with him; possibly, they
sympathized with the revolution; possibly, each of the six secretly
calculated that the other five would be sufficient. <u>Quien sabe?</u> At
all events, he fell only slightly wounded. One bullet--" he spoke
thoughtfully, letting his eyes drop from Saxon's face to the
table-cloth where Saxon's right hand lay--"one bullet pierced his
right hand from back to front."
</p><p>Then, a half-whimsical smile crossed Ribero's somewhat saturnine
features, for Miss Filson had dropped her napkin on Saxon's side, and,
when the painter had stooped to recover it, he did not again replace
the hand on the table.
</p><p>"Before he could be fired on a second time," concluded the diplomat
with a shrug, "a new <u>presidente</u> was on his way to the palace. Your
countryman was saved."
</p><p>If the hero of Ribero's narrative was a malefactor, at least he was a
malefactor with the sympathy of Mr. Bellton's dinner-party, as was
attested by a distinctly audible sigh of relief at the end of the
story. But Señor Ribero was not quite through.
</p><p>"It is not, after all, the story that discredits your countryman," he
explained, "but the sequel. Of course, he became powerful in the new
régime. It was when he was lauded as a national hero that his high
fortunes intoxicated him, and success rotted his moral fiber.
Eventually, he embezzled a fortune from the government which he had
assisted to establish. There was also a matter of--how shall I
say?--of a lady. Then, a duel which was really an assassination. He
escaped with blood on his conscience, presumably to enjoy his stolen
wealth in his own land."
</p><p>"I have often wondered," pursued Ribero, "whether, if that man and I
should ever be thrown together again, he would know me ... and I have
often wished I could remember him only as the brave adventurer--not
also as the criminal."
</p><p>As he finished, the speaker was holding Saxon with his eyes, and had a
question in his glance that seemed to call for some expression from
the other. Saxon bowed with a smile.
</p><p>"It is an engrossing story."
</p><p>"I think," said Duska suddenly, almost critically, "the first part was
so good that it was a pity to spoil it with the rest."
</p><p>Señor Ribero smiled enigmatically into his wine-glass.
</p><p>"I fear, señorita, that is the sad difference between fiction and
history. My tale is a true one."
</p><p>"At all events," continued the girl with vigor, "he was a brave man.
That is enough to remember. I think it is better to forget the rest."
</p><p>It seemed to Ribero that the glance Saxon flashed on her was almost
the glance of gratitude.
</p><p>"What was his name?" she suddenly demanded.
</p><p>"He called himself--at that time--George Carter," Ribero said slowly,
"but gentlemen in the unrecognized pursuits quite frequently have
occasion to change their names. Now, it is probably something else."
</p><p>After the dinner had ended, while the guests fell into groups or
waited for belated carriages, Saxon found himself standing apart, near
the window. It was open on the balcony, and the man felt a sudden wish
for the quiet freshness of the outer air on his forehead. He drew back
the curtain, and stepped across the low sill, then halted as he
realized that he was not alone.
</p><p>The sputtering arc-light swinging over the street made the intervening
branches and leaves of the sidewalk sycamores stand out starkly black,
like a ragged drop hung over a stage.
</p><p>The May moon was only a thin sickle, and the other figure on the
darkly shadowed balcony was vaguely defined, but Saxon at once
recognized, in its lithe slenderness and grace of pose, Miss Filson.
</p><p>"I didn't mean to intrude," he hastily apologized. "I didn't know you
were here."
</p><p>She laughed. "Would that have frightened you?" she asked.
</p><p>She was leaning on the iron rail, and the man took his place at her
side.
</p><p>"I came with the Longmores," she explained, "and their machine hasn't
come yet. It's cool here--and I was thinking--"
</p><p>"You weren't by any chance thinking of Babylon?" he laughed, "or
Macedonia?"
</p><p>She shook her head. "Mr. Ribero's story sticks in my mind. It was so
personal, and--I guess I'm a moody creature. Anyway, I find myself
thinking of it."
</p><p>There was silence for a space, except for the laughter that floated up
from the verandah below them, where a few of the members sat smoking,
and the softened clicking of ivory from the open windows of the
billiard-room. The painter's fingers, resting on the iron rail, closed
over a tendril of clambering moon-flower vine, and nervously twisted
the stem.
</p><p>With an impulsive movement, he leaned forward. His voice was eager.
</p><p>"Suppose," he questioned, "suppose you knew such a man--can you
imagine any circumstances under which you could make excuses for
him?"
</p><p>She stood a moment weighing the problem. "It's a hard question," she
replied finally, then added impulsively: "Do you know, I'm afraid I'm
a terrible heathen? I can excuse so much where there is courage--the
cold sort of chilled-steel courage that he had. What do you think?"
</p><p>The painter drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped his moist
forehead, but, before he could frame his answer, the girl heard a
movement in the room, and turned lightly to join her chaperon.
</p><p>Following her, Saxon found himself saying good-night to a group that
included Ribero. As the attaché shook hands, he held Saxon's somewhat
longer than necessary, seeming to glance at a ring, but really
studying a scar.
</p><p>"You are a good story-teller, Mr. Ribero," said Saxon, quietly.
</p><p>"Ah," countered the other quickly, "but that is easy, señor, where one
has so good a listener. By the way, señor, did you ever chance to
visit Puerto Frio?"
</p><p>The painter shook his head.
</p><p>"Not unless in some other life--some life as dead as that of the
pharaohs."
</p><p>"Ah, well--" the diplomat turned away, still smiling--"some of the
pharaohs are remarkably well preserved."
