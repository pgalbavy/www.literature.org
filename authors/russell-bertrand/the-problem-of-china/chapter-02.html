<p>Where the Chinese came from is a matter of conjecture. Their
early history is known only from their own annals, which throw
no light upon the question. The Shu-King, one of the Confucian
classics (edited, not composed, by Confucius), begins, like Livy,
with legendary accounts of princes whose virtues and vices are
intended to supply edification or warning to subsequent rulers.
Yao and Shun were two model Emperors, whose date (if any) was
somewhere in the third millennium <em>B.C. "</em>The age of Yao
and Shun," in Chinese literature, means what "the Golden Age"
mean with us. It seems certain that, when Chinese history begins,
the Chinese occupied only a small part of what is now China, along
the banks of the Yellow River. They were agricultural, and had
already reached a fairly high level of civilization&mdash;much higher
than that of any other part of Eastern Asia. The Yellow River
is a fierce and terrible stream, too swift for navigation, turgid,
and full of mud, depositing silt upon its bed until it rises above
the surrounding country, when it suddenly alters its course, sweeping
away villages and towns in a destructive torrent. Among most early
agricultural nations, such a river would have inspired superstitious
awe, and floods would have been averted by human sacrifice; in
the Shu-King, however, there is little trace of superstition.
Yao and Shun, and YÃ¼ (the latter's successor), were all occupied
in combating the inundations, but their methods were those of
the engineer, not of the miracle-worker. This shows, at least,
the state of belief in the time of Confucius. The character ascribed
to Yao shows what was expected of an Emperor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
He was reverential, intelligent, accomplished, and<br/>
thoughtful&mdash;naturally and without effort. He was sincerely<br/>
courteous, and capable of all complaisance. The display of these<br/>
qualities reached to the four extremities of the empire, and<br/>
extended from earth to heaven. He was able to make the able and<br/>
virtuous distinguished, and thence proceeded to the love of the<br/>
nine classes of his kindred, who all became harmonious. He also<br/>
regulated and polished the people of his domain, who all became<br/>
brightly intelligent. Finally, he united and harmonized the<br/>
myriad States of the empire; and lo! the black-haired people were<br/>
transformed. The result was universal concord.[1]

</p>
</div>
<p>The first date which can be assigned with precision in Chinese
history is that of an eclipse of the sun in 776 <em>B.C.[2] </em>There
is no reason to doubt the general correctness of the records for
considerably earlier times, but their exact chronology cannot
be fixed. At this period, the Chou dynasty, which fell in 249
<em>B.C. </em>and is supposed to have begun in 1122 <em>B.C.,
</em>was already declining in power as compared with a number
of nominally subordinate feudal States. The position of the Emperor
at this time, and for the next 500 years, was similar to that
of the King of France during those parts of the Middle Ages when
his authority was at its lowest ebb. Chinese history consists
of a series of dynasties, each strong at first and weak afterwards,
each gradually losing control over subordinates, each followed
by a period of anarchy (sometimes lasting for centuries), and
ultimately succeeded by a new dynasty which temporarily re-establishes
a strong Central Government. Historians always attribute the fall
of a dynasty to the excessive power of eunuchs, but perhaps this
is, in part, a literary convention.</p>

<p>What distinguishes the Emperor is not so much his political power,
which fluctuates with the strength of his personality, as certain
religious prerogatives. The Emperor is the Son of Heaven; he sacrifices
to Heaven at the winter solstice. The early Chinese used "Heaven"
as synonymous with "The Supreme Ruler," a monotheistic God;[3]
indeed Professor Giles maintains, by arguments which seem conclusive,
that the correct translation of the Emperor's title would be "Son
of God." The word "Tien," in Chinese, is used both for the sky
and for God, though the latter sense has become rare. The expression
"Shang Ti," which means "Supreme Ruler," belongs in the main to
pre-Confucian times, but both terms originally represented a God
as definitely anthropomorphic as the God of the Old Testament.[4]</p>

<p>As time went by the Supreme Ruler became more shadowy, while
"Heaven" remained, on account of the Imperial rites connected
with it. The Emperor alone had the privilege of worshipping "Heaven,"
and the rites continued practically unchanged until the fall of
the Manchu dynasty in 1911. In modern times they were performed
in the Temple of Heaven in Peking, one of the most beautiful places
in the world. The annual sacrifice in the Temple of Heaven represented
almost the sole official survival of pre-Confucian religion, or
indeed of anything that could be called religion in the strict
sense; for Buddhism and Taoism have never had any connection with
the State.</p>

<p>The history of China is known in some detail from the year 722
<em>B.C., </em>because with this year begins Confucius' <em>Springs
and Autumns</em>, which is a chronicle of the State of Lu, in
which Confucius was an official.</p>

<p>One of the odd things about the history of China is that after
the Emperors have been succeeding each other for more than 2,000
years, one comes to a ruler who is known as the "First Emperor,"
Shih Huang Ti. He acquired control over the whole Empire, after
a series of wars, in 221 <em>B.C., </em>and died in 210 <em>B.C.
</em>Apart from his conquests, he is remarkable for three achievements:
the building of the Great Wall against the Huns, the destruction
of feudalism, and the burning of the books. The destruction of
feudalism, it must be confessed, had to be repeated by many subsequent
rulers; for a long time, feudalism tended to grow up again whenever
the Central Government was in weak hands. But Shih Huang Ti was
the first ruler who made his authority really effective over all
China in historical times. Although his dynasty came to an end
with his son, the impression he made is shown by the fact that
our word "China" is probably derived from his family name, Tsin
or Chin[5]. (The Chinese put the family name first.) His Empire
was roughly co-extensive with what is now China proper.</p>

<p>The destruction of the books was a curious incident. Shih Huang
Ti, as appears from his calling himself "First Emperor," disliked
being reminded of the fact that China had existed before his time;
therefore history was anathema to him. Moreover the literati were
already a strong force in the country, and were always (following
Confucius) in favour of the preservation of ancient customs, whereas
Shih Huang Ti was a vigorous innovator. Moreover, he appears to
have been uneducated and not of pure Chinese race. Moved by the
combined motives of vanity and radicalism, he issued an edict
decreeing that&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
All official histories, except the memoirs of Tsin (his own<br/>
family), shall be burned; except the persons who have the office<br/>
of literati of the great learning, those who in the Empire permit<br/>
themselves to hide the Shi-King, the Shu-King (Confucian<br/>
classics), or the discourses of the hundred schools, must all go<br/>
before the local civil and military authorities so that they may<br/>
be burned. Those who shall dare to discuss among themselves the<br/>
Shi-King and the Shu-King shall be put to death and their corpses<br/>
exposed in a public place; those who shall make use of antiquity<br/>
to belittle modern times shall be put to death with their<br/>
relations.... Thirty days after the publication of this edict,<br/>
those who have not burned their books shall be branded and sent<br/>
to forced labour. The books which shall not be proscribed are<br/>
those of medicine and pharmacy, of divination ..., of agriculture<br/>
and of arboriculture. As for those who desire to study the laws<br/>
and ordinances, let them take the officials as masters. (Cordier,<br/>
op. cit. i. p. 203.)

</p>
</div>
<p>It will be seen that the First Emperor was something of a Bolshevik.
The Chinese literati, naturally, have blackened his memory. On
the other hand, modern Chinese reformers, who have experienced
the opposition of old-fashioned scholars, have a certain sympathy
with his attempt to destroy the innate conservatism of his subjects.
Thus Li Ung Bing[6] says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
No radical change can take place in China without encountering<br/>
the opposition of the literati. This was no less the case then<br/>
than it is now. To abolish feudalism by one stroke was a radical<br/>
change indeed. Whether the change was for the better or the<br/>
worse, the men of letters took no time to inquire; whatever was<br/>
good enough for their fathers was good enough for them and their<br/>
children. They found numerous authorities in the classics to<br/>
support their contention and these they freely quoted to show<br/>
that Shih Huang Ti was wrong. They continued to criticize the<br/>
government to such an extent that something had to be done to<br/>
silence the voice of antiquity ... As to how far this decree (on<br/>
the burning of the books) was enforced, it is hard to say. At any<br/>
rate, it exempted all libraries of the government, or such as<br/>
were in possession of a class of officials called Po Szu or<br/>
Learned Men. If any real damage was done to Chinese literature<br/>
under the decree in question, it is safe to say that it was not<br/>
of such a nature as later writers would have us believe. Still,<br/>
this extreme measure failed to secure the desired end, and a<br/>
number of the men of letters in Han Yang, the capital, was<br/>
subsequently buried alive.

</p>
</div>
<p>This passage is written from the point of view of Young China,
which is anxious to assimilate Western learning in place of the
dead scholarship of the Chinese classics. China, like every other
civilized country, has a tradition which stands in the way of
progress. The Chinese have excelled in stability rather than in
progress; therefore Young China, which perceives that the advent
of industrial civilization has made progress essential to continued
national existence, naturally looks with a favourable eye upon
Shih Huang Ti's struggle with the reactionary pedants of his age.
The very considerable literature which has come down to us from
before his time shows, in any case, that his edict was somewhat
ineffective; and in fact it was repealed after twenty-two years,
in 191. <em>B.C</em>.</p>

<p>After a brief reign by the son of the First Emperor, who did
not inherit his capacity, we come to the great Han dynasty, which
reigned from 206 <em>B.C. </em>to <em>A.D. 220. </em>This was
the great age of Chinese imperialism&mdash;exactly coeval with the
great age of Rome. In the course of their campaigns in Northern
India and Central Asia, the Chinese were brought into contact
with India, with Persia, and even with the Roman Empire.[7] Their
relations with India had a profound effect upon their religion,
as well as upon that of Japan, since they led to the introduction
of Buddhism. Relations with Rome were chiefly promoted by the
Roman desire for silk, and continued until the rise of Mohammedanism.
They had little importance for China, though we learn, for example,
that about <em>A.D. 164 </em>a treatise on astronomy was brought
to China from the Roman Empire.[8] Marcus Aurelius appears in
Chinese history under the name An Tun, which stands for Antoninus.</p>

<p>It was during this period that the Chinese acquired that immense
prestige in the Far East which lasted until the arrival of European
armies and navies in the nineteenth century. One is sometimes
tempted to think that the irruption of the white man into China
may prove almost as ephemeral as the raids of Huns and Tartars
into Europe. The military superiority of Europe to Asia is not
an eternal law of nature, as we are tempted to think; and our
superiority in civilization is a mere delusion. Our histories,
which treat the Mediterranean as the centre of the universe, give
quite a wrong perspective. Cordier,[9] dealing with the campaigns
and voyages of discovery which took place under the Han dynasty,
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
The Occidentals have singularly contracted the field of the<br/>
history of the world when they have grouped around the people of<br/>
Israel, Greece, and Rome the little that they knew of the<br/>
expansion of the human race, being completely ignorant of these<br/>
voyagers who ploughed the China Sea and the Indian Ocean, of<br/>
these cavalcades across the immensities of Central Asia up to the<br/>
Persian Gulf. The greatest part of the universe, and at the same<br/>
time a civilization different but certainly as developed as that<br/>
of the ancient Greeks and Romans, remained unknown to those who<br/>
wrote the history of their little world while they believed that<br/>
they, were setting forth the history of the world as a whole.

</p>
</div>
<p>In our day, this provincialism, which impregnates all our culture,
is liable to have disastrous consequences politically, as well
as for the civilization of mankind. We must make room for Asia
in our thoughts, if we are not to rouse Asia to a fury of self-assertion.</p>

<p>After the Han dynasty there are various short dynasties and periods
of disorder, until we come to the Tang dynasty (<em>A.D. 618-907).
</em>Under this dynasty, in its prosperous days, the Empire acquired
its greatest extent, and art and poetry reached their highest
point.[10] The Empire of Jenghis Khan (died 1227) was considerably
greater, and contained a great part of China; but Jenghis Khan
was a foreign conqueror. Jenghis and his generals, starting from
Mongolia, appeared as conquerors in China, India, Persia, and
Russia. Throughout Central Asia, Jenghis destroyed every man,
woman, and child in the cities he captured. When Merv was captured,
it was transformed into a desert and 700,000 people were killed.
But it was said that many had escaped by lying among the corpses
and pretending to be dead; therefore at the capture of Nishapur,
shortly afterwards, it was ordered that all the inhabitants should
have their heads cut off. Three pyramids of heads were made, one
of men, one of women, and one of children. As it was feared that
some might have escaped by hiding underground, a detachment of
soldiers was left to kill any that might emerge.[11] Similar horrors
were enacted at Moscow and Kieff, in Hungary and Poland. Yet the
man responsible for these massacres was sought in alliance by
St. Louis and the Pope. The times of Jenghis Khan remind one of
the present day, except that his methods of causing death were
more merciful than those that have been employed since the Armistice.</p>

<p>Kublai Khan (died 1294), who is familiar, at least by name, through
Marco Polo and Coleridge; was the grandson of Jenghis Khan, and
the first Mongol who was acknowledged Emperor of China, where
he ousted the Sung dynasty (960-1277). By this time, contact with
China had somewhat abated the savagery of the first conquerors.
Kublai removed his capital from Kara Korom in Mongolia to Peking.
He built walls like those which still surround the city, and established
on the walls an observatory which is preserved to this day. Until
1900, two of the astronomical instruments constructed by Kublai
were still to be seen in this observatory, but the Germans removed
them to Potsdam after the suppression of the Boxers.[12] I understand
they have been restored in accordance with one of the provisions
of the Treaty of Versailles. If so, this was probably the most
important benefit which that treaty secured to the world.</p>

<p>Kublai plays the same part in Japanese history that Philip II
plays in the history of England. He prepared an Invincible Armada,
or rather two successive armadas, to conquer Japan, but they were
defeated, partly by storms, and partly by Japanese valour.</p>

<p>After Kublai, the Mongol Emperors more and more adopted Chinese
ways, and lost their tyrannical vigour. Their dynasty came to
an end in 1370, and was succeeded by the pure Chinese Ming dynasty,
which lasted until the Manchu conquest of 1644. The Manchus in
turn adopted Chinese ways, and were overthrown by a patriotic
revolution in 1911, having contributed nothing notable to the
native culture of China except the pigtail, officially abandoned
at the Revolution.</p>

<p>The persistence of the Chinese Empire down to our own day is
not to be attributed to any military skill; on the contrary, considering
its extent and resources, it has at most times shown itself weak
and incompetent in war. Its southern neighbours were even less
warlike, and were less in extent. Its northern and western neighbours
inhabited a barren country, largely desert, which was only capable
of supporting a very sparse population. The Huns were defeated
by the Chinese after centuries of warfare; the Tartars and Manchus,
on the contrary, conquered China. But they were too few and too
uncivilized to impose their ideas or their way of life upon China,
which absorbed them and went on its way as if they had never existed.
Rome could have survived the Goths, if they had come alone, but
the successive waves of barbarians came too quickly to be all
civilized in turn. China was saved from this fate by the Gobi
Desert and the Tibetan uplands. Since the white men have taken
to coming by sea, the old geographical immunity is lost, and greater
energy will be required to preserve the national independence.</p>

<p>In spite of geographical advantages, however, the persistence
of Chinese civilization, fundamentally unchanged since the introduction
of Buddhism, is a remarkable phenomenon. Egypt and Babylonia persisted
as long, but since they fell there has been nothing comparable
in the world. Perhaps the main cause is the immense population
of China, with an almost complete identity of culture throughout.
In the middle of the eighth century, the population of China is
estimated at over 50 millions, though ten years later, as a result
of devastating wars, it is said to have sunk to about 17 millions.[13]
A census has been taken at various times in Chinese history, but
usually a census of houses, not of individuals. From the number
of houses the population is computed by a more or less doubtful
calculation. It is probable, also, that different methods were
adopted on different occasions, and that comparisons between different
enumerations are therefore rather unsafe. Putnam Weale[14] says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
The first census taken by the Manchus in 1651, after the<br/>
restoration of order, returned China's population at 55 million<br/>
persons, which is less than the number given in the first census<br/>
of the Han dynasty, <em>A.D. 1, </em>and about the same as when Kublai<br/>
Khan established the Mongal dynasty in 1295. (This is presumably<br/>
a misprint, as Kublai died in 1294.) Thus we are faced by the<br/>
amazing fact that, from the beginning of the Christian era, the<br/>
toll of life taken by internecine and frontier wars in China was<br/>
so great that in spite of all territorial expansion the<br/>
population for upwards of sixteen centuries remained more or less<br/>
stationary. There is in all history no similar record. Now,<br/>
however, came a vast change. Thus three years after the death of<br/>
the celebrated Manchu Emperor Kang Hsi, in 1720, the population<br/>
had risen to 125 millions. At the beginning of the reign of the<br/>
no less illustrious Ch'ien Lung (1743) it was returned at 145<br/>
millions; towards the end of his reign, in 1783, it had doubled,<br/>
and was given as 283 millions. In the reign of Chia Ch'ing (1812)<br/>
it had risen to 360 millions; before the Taiping rebellion (1842)<br/>
it had grown to 413 millions; after that terrible rising it sunk<br/>
to 261 millions.

</p>
</div>
<p>I do not think such definite statements are warranted. The China
Year Book for 1919 (the latest I have seen) says (p. 1):&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
The taking of a census by the methods adopted in Western nations<br/>
has never yet been attempted in China, and consequently estimates<br/>
of the total population have varied to an extraordinary degree.<br/>
The nearest approach to a reliable estimate is, probably, the<br/>
census taken by the Minchengpu (Ministry of Interior) in 1910,<br/>
the results of which are embodied in a report submitted to the<br/>
Department of State at Washington by Mr. Raymond P. Tenney, a<br/>
Student Interpreter at the <em>U.S. </em>Legation, Peking.... It is<br/>
pointed out that even this census can only be regarded as<br/>
approximate, as, with few exceptions, households and not<br/>
individuals were counted.

</p>
</div>
<p>The estimated population of the Chinese Empire (exclusive of
Tibet) is given, on the basis of this census, as 329,542,000,
while the population of Tibet is estimated at 1,500,000. Estimates
which have been made at various other dates are given as follows

<p>These figures suffice to show how little is known about the population
of China. Not only are widely divergent estimates made in the
same year (<em>e.g.</em> 1760), but in other respects the figures
are incredible. Mr. Putnam Weale might contend that the drop from
60 millions in 1580 to 21 millions in 1662 was due to the wars
leading to the Manchu conquest. But no one can believe that between
1711 and 1736 the population increased from 28 millions to 125
millions, or that it doubled between 1790 and 1792. No one knows
whether the population of China is increasing or diminishing,
whether people in general have large or small families, or any
of the other facts that vital statistics are designed to elucidate.
What is said on these subjects, however dogmatic, is no more than
guess-work. Even the population of Peking is unknown. It is said
to be about 900,000, but it may be anywhere between 800,000 and
a million. As for the population of the Chinese Empire, it is
probably safe to assume that it is between three and four hundred
millions, and somewhat likely that it is below three hundred and
fifty millions. Very little indeed can be said with confidence
as to the population of China in former times; so little that,
on the whole, authors who give statistics are to be distrusted.</p>

<p>There are certain broad features of the traditional Chinese civilization
which give it its distinctive character. I should be inclined
to select as the most important: (1) The use of ideograms instead
of an alphabet in writing; (2) The substitution of the Confucian
ethic for religion among the educated classes; (3) government
by literati chosen by examination instead of by a hereditary aristocracy.
The family system distinguishes traditional China from modern
Europe, but represents a stage which most other civilizations
have passed through, and which is therefore not distinctively
Chinese; the three characteristics which I have enumerated, on
the other hand, distinguish China from all other countries of
past times. Something must be said at this stage about each of
the three.</p>

<p>1. As everyone knows, the Chinese do not have letters, as we
do, but symbols for whole words. This has, of course, many inconveniences:
it means that, in learning to write, there are an immense number
of different signs to be learnt, not only 26 as with us; that
there is no such thing as alphabetical order, so that dictionaries,
files, catalogues, etc., are difficult to arrange and linotype
is impossible; that foreign words, such as proper names and scientific
terms, cannot be written down by sound, as in European languages,
but have to be represented by some elaborate device.[15] For these
reasons, there is a movement for phonetic writing among the more
advanced Chinese reformers; and I think the success of this movement
is essential if China is to take her place among the bustling
hustling nations which consider that they have a monopoly of all
excellence. Even if there were no other argument for the change,
the difficulty of elementary education, where reading and writing
take so long to learn, would be alone sufficient to decide any
believer in democracy. For practical purposes, therefore, the
movement for phonetic writing deserves support.</p>

<p>There are, however, many considerations, less obvious to a European,
which can be adduced in favour of the ideographic system, to which
something of the solid stability of the Chinese civilization is
probably traceable. To us, it seems obvious that a written word
must represent a sound, whereas to the Chinese it represents an
idea. We have adopted the Chinese system ourselves as regards
numerals; "1922," for example, can be read in English, French,
or any other language, with quite different sounds, but with the
same meaning. Similarly what is written in Chinese characters
can be read throughout China, in spite of the difference of dialects
which are mutually unintelligible when spoken. Even a Japanese,
without knowing a word of spoken Chinese, can read out Chinese
script in Japanese, just as he could read a row of numerals written
by an Englishman. And the Chinese can still read their classics,
although the spoken language must have changed as much as French
has changed from Latin.</p>

<p>The advantage of writing over speech is its greater permanence,
which enables it to be a means of communication between different
places and different times. But since the spoken language changes
from place to place and from time to time, the characteristic
advantage of writing is more fully attained by a script which
does not aim at representing spoken sounds than by one which does.</p>

<p>Speaking historically, there is nothing peculiar in the Chinese
method of writing, which represents a stage through which all
writing probably passed. Writing everywhere seems to have begun
as pictures, not as a symbolic representation of sounds. I understand
that in Egyptian hieroglyphics the course of development from
ideograms to phonetic writing can be studied. What is peculiar
in China is the preservation of the ideographic system throughout
thousands of years of advanced civilization&mdash;a preservation probably
due, at least in part, to the fact that the spoken language is
monosyllabic, uninflected and full of homonyms.</p>

<p>As to the way in which the Chinese system of writing has affected
the mentality of those who employ it, I find some suggestive reflections
in an article published in the <em>Chinese Students' Monthly</em>
(Baltimore), for February 1922, by Mr. Chi Li, in an article on
"Some Anthropological Problems of China." He says (p. 327):&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Language has been traditionally treated by European scientists as<br/>
a collection of sounds instead of an expression of something<br/>
inner and deeper than the vocal apparatus as it should be. The<br/>
accumulative effect of language-symbols upon one's mental<br/>
formulation is still an unexploited field. Dividing the world<br/>
culture of the living races on this basis, one perceives a<br/>
fundamental difference of its types between the alphabetical<br/>
users and the hieroglyphic users, each of which has its own<br/>
virtues and vices. Now, with all respects to alphabetical<br/>
civilization, it must be frankly stated that it has a grave and<br/>
inherent defect in its lack of solidity. The most civilized<br/>
portion under the alphabetical culture is also inhabited by the<br/>
most fickled people. The history of the Western land repeats the<br/>
same story over and over again. Thus up and down with the Greeks;<br/>
up and down with Rome; up and down with the Arabs. The ancient<br/>
Semitic and Hametic peoples are essentially alphabetic users, and<br/>
their civilizations show the same lack of solidity as the Greeks<br/>
and the Romans. Certainly this phenomenon can be partially<br/>
explained by the extra-fluidity of the alphabetical language<br/>
which cannot be depended upon as a suitable organ to conserve any<br/>
solid idea. Intellectual contents of these people may be likened<br/>
to waterfalls and cataracts, rather than seas and oceans. No<br/>
other people is richer in ideas than they; but no people would<br/>
give up their valuable ideas as quickly as they do....

</p>
<p>
The Chinese language is by all means the counterpart of the<br/>
alphabetic stock. It lacks most of the virtues that are found in<br/>
the alphabetic language; but as an embodiment of simple and final<br/>
truth, it is invulnerable to storm and stress. It has already<br/>
protected the Chinese civilization for more than forty centuries.<br/>
It is solid, square, and beautiful, exactly as the spirit of it<br/>
represents. Whether it is the spirit that has produced this<br/>
language or whether this language has in turn accentuated the<br/>
spirit remains to be determined.

</p>
</div>
<p>Without committing ourselves wholly to the theory here set forth,
which is impregnated with Chinese patriotism, we must nevertheless
admit that the Westerner is unaccustomed to the idea of "alphabetical
civilization" as merely one kind, to which he happens to belong.
I am not competent to judge as to the importance of the ideographic
script in producing the distinctive characteristics of Chinese
civilization, but I have no doubt that this importance is very
great, and is more or less of the kind indicated in the above
quotation.</p>

<p>2. Confucius (<em>B.C. 551-479) </em>must be reckoned, as regards
his social influence, with the founders of religions. His effect
on institutions and on men's thoughts has been of the same kind
of magnitude as that of Buddha, Christ, or Mahomet, but curiously
different in its nature. Unlike Buddha and Christ, he is a completely
historical character, about whose life a great deal is known,
and with whom legend and myth have been less busy than with most
men of his kind. What most distinguishes him from other founders
is that he inculcated a strict code of ethics, which has been
respected ever since, but associated it with very little religious
dogma, which gave place to complete theological scepticism in
the countless generations of Chinese literati who revered his
memory and administered the Empire.</p>

<p>Confucius himself belongs rather to the type of Lycurgus and
Solon than to that of the great founders of religions. He was
a practical statesman, concerned with the administration of the
State; the virtues he sought to inculcate were not those of personal
holiness, or designed to secure salvation in a future life, but
rather those which lead to a peaceful and prosperous community
here on earth. His outlook was essentially conservative, and aimed
at preserving the virtues of former ages. He accepted the existing
religion&mdash;a rather unemphatic monotheism, combined with belief
that the spirits of the dead preserved a shadowy existence, which
it was the duty of their descendants to render as comfortable
as possible. He did not, however, lay any stress upon supernatural
matters. In answer to a question, he gave the following definition
of wisdom: "To cultivate earnestly our duty towards our neighbour,
and to reverence spiritual beings while maintaining always a due
reserve."[16] But reverence for spiritual beings was not an <em>active</em>
part of Confucianism, except in the form of ancestor-worship,
which was part of filial piety, and thus merged in duty towards
one's neighbour. Filial piety included obedience to the Emperor,
except when he was so wicked as to forfeit his divine right&mdash;for
the Chinese, unlike the Japanese, have always held that resistance
to the Emperor was justified if he governed very badly. The following
passage from Professor Giles[17] illustrates this point:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
The Emperor has been uniformly regarded as the son of God by<br/>
adoption only, and liable to be displaced from that position as a<br/>
punishment for the offence of misrule.... If the ruler failed in<br/>
his duties, the obligation of the people was at an end, and his<br/>
divine right disappeared simultaneously. Of this we have an<br/>
example in a portion of the Canon to be examined by and by. Under<br/>
the year 558 <em>B.C. </em>we find the following narrative. One of the<br/>
feudal princes asked an official, saying, "Have not the people of<br/>
the Wei State done very wrong in expelling their ruler?" "Perhaps<br/>
the ruler himself," was the reply, "may have done very wrong....<br/>
If the life of the people is impoverished, and if the spirits<br/>
are deprived of their sacrifices, of what use is the ruler, and<br/>
what can the people do but get rid of him?"

</p>
</div>
<p>This very sensible doctrine has been accepted at all times throughout
Chinese history, and has made rebellions only too frequent.</p>

<p>Filial piety, and the strength of the family generally, are perhaps
the weakest point in Confucian ethics, the only point where the
system departs seriously from common sense. Family feeling has
militated against public spirit, and the authority of the old
has increased the tyranny of ancient custom. In the present day,
when China is confronted with problems requiring a radically new
outlook, these features of the Confucian system have made it a
barrier to necessary reconstruction, and accordingly we find all
those foreigners who wish to exploit China praising the old tradition
and deriding the efforts of Young China to construct something
more suited to modern needs. The way in which Confucian emphasis
on filial piety prevented the growth of public spirit is illustrated
by the following story:[18]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
One of the feudal princes was boasting to Confucius of the high<br/>
level of morality which prevailed in his own State. "Among us<br/>
here," he said, "you will find upright men. If a father has<br/>
stolen a sheep, his son will give evidence against him." "In my<br/>
part of the country," replied Confucius, "there is a different<br/>
standard from this. A father will shield his son, a son will<br/>
shield his father. It is thus that uprightness will be found."

</p>
</div>
<p>It is interesting to contrast this story with that of the elder
Brutus and his sons, upon which we in the West were all brought
up.</p>

<p>Chao Ki, expounding the Confucian doctrine, says it is contrary
to filial piety to refuse a lucrative post by which to relieve
the indigence of one's aged parents.[19] This form of sin, however,
is rare in China as in other countries.</p>

<p>The worst failure of filial piety, however, is to remain without
children, since ancestors are supposed to suffer if they have
no descendants to keep up their cult. It is probable that this
doctrine has made the Chinese more prolific, in which case it
has had great biological importance. Filial piety is, of course,
in no way peculiar to China, but has been universal at a certain
stage of culture. In this respect, as in certain others, what
is peculiar to China is the preservation of the old custom after
a very high level of civilization had been attained. The early
Greeks and Romans did not differ from the Chinese in this respect,
but as their civilization advanced the family became less and
less important. In China, this did not begin to happen until our
own day.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said against filial piety carried to excess,
it is certainly less harmful than its Western counterpart, patriotism.
Both, of course, err in inculcating duties to a certain portion
of mankind to the practical exclusion of the rest. But patriotism
directs one's loyalty to a fighting unit, which filial piety does
not (except in a very primitive society). Therefore patriotism
leads much more easily to militarism and imperialism. The principal
method of advancing the interests of one's nation is homicide;
the principal method of advancing the interest of one's family
is corruption and intrigue. Therefore family feeling is less harmful
than patriotism. This view is borne out by the history and present
condition of China as compared to Europe.</p>

<p>Apart from filial piety, Confucianism was, in practice, mainly
a code of civilized behaviour, degenerating at times into an etiquette
book. It taught self-restraint, moderation, and above all courtesy.
Its moral code was not, like those of Buddhism and Christianity,
so severe that only a few saints could hope to live up to it,
or so much concerned with personal salvation as to be incompatible
with political institutions. It was not difficult for a man of
the world to live up to the more imperative parts of the Confucian
teaching. But in order to do this he must exercise at all times
a certain kind of self-control&mdash;an extension of the kind which
children learn when they are taught to "behave." He must not break
into violent passions; he must not be arrogant; he must "save
face," and never inflict humiliations upon defeated adversaries;
he must be moderate in all things, never carried away by excessive
love or hate; in a word, he must keep calm reason always in control
of all his actions. This attitude existed in Europe in the eighteenth
century, but perished in the French Revolution: romanticism, Rousseau,
and the guillotine put an end to it. In China, though wars and
revolutions have occurred constantly, Confucian calm has survived
them all, making them less terrible for the participants, and
making all who were not immediately involved hold aloof. It is
bad manners in China to attack your adversary in wet weather.
Wu-Pei-Fu, I am told, once did it, and won a victory; the beaten
general complained of the breach of etiquette; so Wu-Pei-Fu went
back to the position he held before the battle, and fought all
over again on a fine day. (It should be said that battles in China
are seldom bloody.) In such a country, militarism is not the scourge
it is with us; and the difference is due to the Confucian ethics.[20]</p>

<p>Confucianism did not assume its present form until the twelfth
century <em>A.D., </em>when the personal God in whom Confucius
had believed was thrust aside by the philosopher Chu Fu Tze,[21]
whose interpretation of Confucianism has ever since been recognized
as orthodox. Since the fall of the Mongols (1370), the Government
has uniformly favoured Confucianism as the teaching of the State;
before that, there were struggles with Buddhism and Taoism, which
were connected with magic, and appealed to superstitious Emperors,
quite a number of whom died of drinking the Taoist elixir of life.
The Mongol Emperors were Buddhists of the Lama religion, which
still prevails in Tibet and Mongolia; but the Manchu Emperors,
though also northern conquerors, were ultra-orthodox Confucians.
It has been customary in China, for many centuries, for the literati
to be pure Confucians, sceptical in religion but not in morals,
while the rest of the population believed and practised all three
religions simultaneously. The Chinese have not the belief, which
we owe to the Jews, that if one religion is true, all others must
be false. At the present day, however, there appears to be very
little in the way of religion in China, though the belief in magic
lingers on among the uneducated. At all times, even when there
was religion, its intensity was far less than in Europe. It is
remarkable that religious scepticism has not led, in China, to
any corresponding ethical scepticism, as it has done repeatedly
in Europe.</p>

<p>3. I come now to the system of selecting officials by competitive
examination, without which it is hardly likely that so literary
and unsuperstitious a system as that of Confucius could have maintained
its hold. The view of the modern Chinese on this subject is set
forth by the present President of the Republic of China, Hsu Shi-chang,
in his book on <em>China after the War</em>, pp. 59-60.[22] After
considering the educational system under the Chou dynasty, he
continues:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
In later periods, in spite of minor changes, the importance of<br/>
moral virtues continued to be stressed upon. For instance, during<br/>
the most flourishing period of Tang Dynasty (627-650 <em>A.D.), </em>the<br/>
Imperial Academy of Learning, known as Kuo-tzu-chien, was<br/>
composed of four collegiate departments, in which ethics was<br/>
considered as the most important of all studies. It was said that<br/>
in the Academy there were more than three thousand students who<br/>
were able and virtuous in nearly all respects, while the total<br/>
enrolment, including aspirants from Korea and Japan, was as high<br/>
as eight thousand. At the same time, there was a system of<br/>
"elections" through which able and virtuous men were recommended<br/>
by different districts to the Emperor for appointment to public<br/>
offices. College training and local elections supplemented each<br/>
other, but in both moral virtues were given the greatest<br/>
emphasis.

</p>
<p>
Although the Imperial Academy exists till this day, it has never<br/>
been as nourishing as during that period. For this change the<br/>
introduction of the competitive examination or Ko-chÃ¼ system,<br/>
must be held responsible. The "election" system furnished no<br/>
fixed standard for the recommendation of public service<br/>
candidates, and, as a result, tended to create an aristocratic<br/>
class from which alone were to be found eligible men.<br/>
Consequently, the Sung Emperors (960-1277 <em>A.D.) </em>abolished the<br/>
elections, set aside the Imperial Academy, and inaugurated the<br/>
competitive examination system in their place. The examinations<br/>
were to supply both scholars and practical statesmen, and they<br/>
were periodically held throughout the later dynasties until the<br/>
introduction of the modern educational regime. Useless and<br/>
stereotyped as they were in later days, they once served some<br/>
useful purpose. Besides, the ethical background of Chinese<br/>
education had already been so firmly established, that, in spite<br/>
of the emphasis laid by these examinations on pure literary<br/>
attainments, moral teachings have survived till this day in<br/>
family education and in private schools.

</p>
</div>
<p>Although the system of awarding Government posts for proficiency
in examinations is much better than most other systems that have
prevailed, such as nepotism, bribery, threats of insurrection,
etc., yet the Chinese system, at any rate after it assumed its
final form, was harmful through the fact that it was based solely
on the classics, that it was purely literary, and that it allowed
no scope whatever for originality. The system was established
in its final form by the Emperor Hung Wu (1368-1398), and remained
unchanged until 1905. One of the first objects of modern Chinese
reformers was to get it swept away. Li Ung Bing[23] says:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
In spite of the many good things that may be said to the credit<br/>
of Hung Wu, he will ever be remembered in connection with a form<br/>
of evil which has eaten into the very heart of the nation. This<br/>
was the system of triennial examinations, or rather the form of<br/>
Chinese composition, called the "Essay," or the "Eight Legs,"<br/>
which, for the first time in the history of Chinese literature,<br/>
was made the basis of all literary contests. It was so-named,<br/>
because after the introduction of the theme the writer was<br/>
required to treat it in four paragraphs, each consisting of two<br/>
members, made up of an equal number of sentences and words. The<br/>
theme was always chosen from either the Four Books, or the Five<br/>
Classics. The writer could not express any opinion of his own, or<br/>
any views at variance with those expressed by Chu Hsi and his<br/>
school. All he was required to do was to put the few words of<br/>
Confucius, or whomsoever it might be, into an essay in conformity<br/>
with the prescribed rules. Degrees, which were to serve as<br/>
passports to Government positions, were awarded the best writers.<br/>
To say that the training afforded by the time required to make a<br/>
man efficient in the art of such writing, would at the same time<br/>
qualify him to hold the various offices under the Government, was<br/>
absurd. But absurd as the whole system was, it was handed down to<br/>
recent times from the third year of the reign of Hung Wu, and was<br/>
not abolished until a few years ago. No system was more perfect<br/>
or effective in retarding the intellectual and literary<br/>
development of a nation. With her "Eight Legs," China long ago<br/>
reached the lowest point on her downhill journey. It is largely<br/>
on account of the long lease of life that was granted to this<br/>
rotten system that the teachings of the Sung philosophers have<br/>
been so long venerated.

</p>
</div>
<p>These are the words of a Chinese patriot of the present day,
and no doubt, as a modern system, the "Eight Legs" deserve all
the hard things that he says about them. But in the fourteenth
century, when one considers the practicable alternatives, one
can see that there was probably much to be said for such a plan.
At any rate, for good or evil, the examination system profoundly
affected the civilization of China. Among its good effects were:
A widely-diffused respect for learning; the possibility of doing
without a hereditary aristocracy; the selection of administrators
who must at least have been capable of industry; and the preservation
of Chinese civilization in spite of barbarian conquest. But, like
so much else in traditional China, it has had to be swept away
to meet modern needs. I hope nothing of greater value will have
to perish in the struggle to repel the foreign exploiters and
the fierce and cruel system which they miscall civilization.</p>

stood in the very forefront of civilization. She was then the
most powerful, the most enlightened, the most progressive, and
the best governed empire, not only in Asia, but on the face of

Persia, the Caspian Sea, and the Altai of the Kirghis steppe,
