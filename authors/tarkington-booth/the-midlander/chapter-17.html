<p><em>THE </em>day after her funeral Mr. Oliphant brought home
a copy of her will and read it to his wife and their sons and
daughter-in-law in the library. He read slowly, while his four
auditors sat in a silence broken only once, though the document
was a long one. The single interruption was a vocal sound from
Dan when the bequest to himself was mentioned, an exclamation
the import of which was not determinable by the others.</p>

<p>But before the reading Mr. Oliphant made some introductory remarks
as he wiped his glasses: The estate appeared to be "somewhat larger
than anticipated," he said, as Mrs. Savage’s boxes in the bank’s
deposit vaults contained securities she had never mentioned;—she
had always been "very reticent in such matters." The value of
her possessions might be "estimated roughly at probably upward
of eight hundred thousand dollars, in addition to her house and
a small amount of other real estate." Then he took up the typewritten
sheets of the will.</p>

<p>Mrs. Savage had always been known in the town as "pretty close";
for her early youth was of the "old-settler" days when people
who failed to be thrifty might also fail to keep themselves alive;
and something of this quality had the air of striving to survive
her in the posthumous expression of her wishes. She had left one
hundred and thirty-five dollars to each of her three elderly servants;
and seven hundred and fifty dollars to every "established charitable
institution of worth and merit" in the city, the "worth and merit"
to be determined by her executors, those two discreet men of substance,
Mr. George Rowe and Mr. John P. Johns.</p>

<p>Mr. Oliphant’s throat seemed to trouble him when he came to the
next clause, for he read it huskily, the papers trembling slightly
in his hand. The paragraph concerned Mrs. Savage’s "dearly and
well-beloved grandson, Daniel Oliphant" and carefully explained
her reasons for making what might seem an unfair division of her
property.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Inasmuch as my said grandson, Daniel, has not seen fit to avail<br/>
himself of the sound advice of those more experienced, and in<br/>
particular has acted directly contrary to my own counsel for his<br/>
well-being, both in the conduct of his business and in other<br/>
affairs, wherein I have endeavoured to assist him and offer him<br/>
guidance, and although I intend this clause in no manner to<br/>
reflect upon or in any way impugn his probity and honour, which<br/>
have always been above reproach, I am compelled to draw the<br/>
conclusion that he has not shown that discretion in the<br/>
management of his affairs which would convince me that in his<br/>
hands any large sum or parcel of my estate might not soon be<br/>
dispersed and disappear without profit to himself. Therefore,<br/>
out of regard to his welfare, as well as to my own peace of<br/>
mind, and as a token only of the sincere affection I bear him, I<br/>
devise and bequeath to my said grandson, Daniel Oliphant, to be<br/>
paid to him in cash by my executors out of the sum remaining on<br/>
deposit to my credit at the First National Bank of this city<br/>
after my funeral expenses and other just debts and the above<br/>
mentioned bequests shall have been paid, the sum of thirty-five<br/>
hundred dollars.

<p>It was then that the indeterminable vocal sound came from the
corner where Dan sat—a sound not unlike a slight, irrepressible
gasp, though not distinctly that; nor was the nature of the emotion
producing it indicated by the sound itself. No one looked at Dan,
and his father hastily went on with the reading.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Oliphant her mother had left the income to be derived
from "securities to the value of two hundred and twenty-five thousand
dollars, these securities to be held in trust for her." Mrs. Oliphant
was to have the income from them during her life, but she could
not sell them or give them away, though she was left at liberty
to bequeath them to whom she pleased. And the rest of the estate,
much the greater part of it, was left without condition—and also
without defining him as "dearly and well-beloved"—to her grandson,
Harlan, the residuary legatee.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" Harlan said loudly, and, without further explanation
of his feelings, sat staring blankly at the wall opposite him.</p>

<p>Wiping her eyes, Mrs. Oliphant looked at Dan; and her husband
also turned in that direction.</p>

<p>"Dan, old fellow," he began, in a distressed voice, "you mustn’t
think——"</p>

<p>But Lena interrupted him. She jumped up from her chair, and her
cheeks and temples were alive with a colour that outdid all the
extraneous tinting her grandmother-in-law had so hated. "This
is aimed at <em>me</em>!" she cried. "I understand perfectly the
real meaning of that precious document! Heaven knows why, but
she must have disliked me before Dan ever brought me here! She
showed spite at her first sight of me, and tried to hurt me, and
did hurt me. And now she cuts us off with nothing and gives it
all to Harlan just to show she thought that all I care about is
money—yes, and to prove she can still injure me and insult me
even after she’s dead!"</p>

<p>But here the hot little voice was choked with anger and tears;—she
ran to the door. "What <em>are</em> such people?" she sobbed,
stopping there for a moment, and addressing to the upper air of
the room this inquiry of passionate wonderment. "Oh, my heavens!
What <em>are</em> these people I’ve got to spend my life among?"</p>

<p>Then she ran through the hall and up the stairs, sobbing more
and more uncontrollably, and audible below until the vigorous
action of her splendidly constructed bedroom door produced a sonorous
climax, followed by instantaneous silence. Dan had risen, apparently
intending to follow her, but he paused as his father spoke to
him.</p>

<p>"I believe I wouldn’t, if I were you, Dan."</p>

<p>"Wouldn’t what, sir?"</p>

<p>"I think I’d just let her alone to have it out with herself.
I’ve noticed it seems to work better, she gets herself in hand
sooner that way."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Dan said, and moved to depart.</p>

<p>"Wait just a minute. I think your mother has something she wants
to say to you." Mrs. Oliphant, who was holding her handkerchief
to her eyes, had made a slight gesture, which her husband thus
interpreted, and Dan turned back quickly and stood before her.</p>

<p>"What is it, mother?"</p>

<p>She caught his hand and held it, speaking brokenly:</p>

<p>"You—you mustn’t think——Mother loved you—she <em>did</em>! She—she
left it so that <em>I</em> could always—always take care of you,
if you—if you needed it. She didn’t mean anything unkind to you."</p>

<p>Mr. Oliphant supplemented this. "I believe your mother’s entirely
right, Dan. The division may seem unfair, but I’m strongly of
the opinion there was no intention to be unkind or to—or to hurt
you!"</p>

<p>"‘<em>Hurt</em> me!’" Dan exclaimed loudly. His face was aglow
and his eyes were shining. "Hurt me? Why, she didn’t leave <em>you</em>
anything, sir, and you’re not hurt. And just look what she’s done
for me! Why, even you and mother had begun to think I couldn’t
hold on to Ornaby this time, but grandma’s left me not only enough
to tide me over, but to go <em>ahead</em> with! I’m goin’ to set
out the stakes for that automobile factory to-morrow!"</p>

<p>He turned again toward the door as he spoke; and his father again
mistook his intention. "Dan, I—I really wouldn’t go up to talk
to Lena just now. If we all just let her alone when she’s in one
of these—ah—that is, I’ve noticed if we keep away——"</p>

<p>"Yes, so have I," Dan agreed heartily. "That’s not where I’m
headed for, sir."</p>

<p>His mother had retained his hand in spite of his movement to
go, and now she tried to draw him nearer her. "Stay with us, dear,"
she pleaded. "You’re so plucky, you poor boy, but I know it <em>has</em>
hurt you. I know you want to get outdoors and walk and walk and
grieve to yourself, but if you’d stay with your father and me——"</p>

<p>"I can’t," he said, and detached his hand from hers though she
still sought to keep it. "I <em>got</em> to go, mother."</p>

<p>"But where?" she begged. "Where do you want to go at such a time
as this, dear?"</p>

<p>"Where?" he cried triumphantly. "Why, to see those executors
and get that money! I’m goin’ to make George Rowe and old John
P. Johns agree to advance it to me the first thing to-morrow morning.
Grandma’s saved Ornaby for me, God bless her!"</p>

<p>He waved an exultant hand over his head and departed at a long
and rapid stride, leaving his father and mother to stare at one
another with pathetic inquiry; but after a moment or two of this
Mr. Oliphant laughed vaguely, sighed, shook his head, and said:
"Why, he <em>means</em> it!"</p>

<p>"You don’t think he’s just covering up what he feels? Pretending——"</p>

<p>"Pretending? No!" her husband returned. "All your mother’s will
means to him is that he can go on with his Addition!"</p>

<p>"But he can’t. Thirty-five hundred dollars won’t——"</p>

<p>"No, not long," Mr. Oliphant admitted. "But it looks like a million
to him to-day, because it pulls him around this particular corner.
Of course in a little while there’ll be another corner that he
<em>can’t</em> get pulled around, but he doesn’t see that one
now. All he’s thinking about——"</p>

<p>"But he expects to begin a <em>factory</em>!" she exclaimed.
"I haven’t a doubt he’ll try to."</p>

<p>"Neither have I; and that’ll bring the corner he can’t turn just
so much nearer."</p>

<p>"It seems so pitiful," the mother lamented. "I’ll help him all
I can. There’s the income of what she’s given me——"</p>

<p>"It won’t go very far," Oliphant informed her, ruefully amused.
"Not with the kind of plans Dan’ll be making now that he’s got
hold of thirty-five hundred dollars!"</p>

<p>"Well, but then," she said brightly, yet with a little timidity,
"you see, there’s Harlan. Harlan could——" She hesitated; and both
of them turned, though not confidently, toward their younger son
who still continued to sit motionless in his chair, in the bay
window, staring at the opposite wall. He seemed unaware that they
were looking at him, until his mother addressed him directly.
"Harlan, you <em>would</em>, wouldn’t you?"</p>

<p>He merged from his deep interior of thought like a man blinking
in the sun after exploring a cavern. "What?"</p>

<p>"I said, wouldn’t you——"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he interrupted. "Yes, I heard what you said, though
I was thinking of something else. I wonder if either of you understand
just what grandma was up to."</p>

<p>"It seems to be plain enough," his father said. "She’d always
been a pretty sharp business woman; she was convinced that your
grandfather’s success was mainly due to her advice, and I expect
it was, myself—anyhow a good deal of it—so she thought Dan ought
to’ve listened to her when she opposed his putting what your grandfather
left him and all he could borrow besides into this real-estate
venture. I’m afraid she felt rather bitter when he went ahead
with it in spite of all she said against it. So it seems pretty
clear that she thought if she left him anything substantial it
would all be thrown away on a scheme she thinks is bound to fail—she
couldn’t imagine the city’s ever growing out that far—and she
didn’t want her money wasted. So she left it to you. I don’t see
anything particularly enigmatic about it, Harlan."</p>

<p>"No," Harlan agreed, though his dry smile was evidence that he
withheld his true thought on the matter; "I suppose not. At least,
there’s nothing enigmatic about it to me." He was obviously not
elated over his good fortune; and his mother saw fit to commend
him for this.</p>

<p>"I think—I think it’s so sweet of you, dear," she said timidly;—"I
mean especially while Dan was here—your not showing any pleasure
in having so much come to you. I think it’s noble, Harlan."</p>

<p>"You do?" he asked, and he laughed briefly without any merriment.
"Perhaps I’d better explain what I believe grandma really meant.
She never liked me, and she always adored Dan. It’s curious, too,
because Dan’s disposition is like grandfather’s, and she certainly
never seemed to think much of grandfather! Well, she did hate
Dan’s throwing his money away on a wild scheme that can’t possibly
do anything in the end but leave him bankrupt; and she certainly
understood him—she knew no matter how much he could lay his hands
on, he’d pour it all in after the rest—and it’s true she didn’t
want her money wasted that way, and knew I wouldn’t let it be
wasted at all, if she left it to me; but that wasn’t what she
really had in mind. Lord, no!"</p>

<p>"Wasn’t it?" his father inquired gravely. "I don’t see anything
else."</p>

<p>Harlan laughed again with the same dry brevity. "She always hoped
Dan would marry Martha Shelby—and she kept on hoping it, even
after he married Lena."</p>

<p>"Harlan!" his mother protested. "You oughtn’t to speak like that!
Why, mother couldn’t any more have thought of such a thing, when
Dan was already married——"</p>

<p>"She died hoping it," Harlan insisted. "I tell you——"</p>

<p>Mr. Oliphant interrupted. "That seems to me about as far-fetched
an idea as I’ve often heard, Harlan."</p>

<p>"Does it, sir? Didn’t you ever hear grandmother express her opinion
of Lena?"</p>

<p>"Somewhat frequently."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear her mention her conviction that Lena was entirely
mercenary and married Dan because she thought he was rich?"</p>

<p>"She talked that way sometimes—yes."</p>

<p>"And didn’t Lena just show us she thinks that’s what the will
means, herself?"</p>

<p>"Possibly," Mr. Oliphant admitted. "But that doesn’t prove——"</p>

<p>"You might just read over that document of grandma’s again,"
Harlan suggested. "She appears to leave me everything and Dan
nothing, but gives mother a very comfortable living income, and
she knew mother will take care of him when he needs it. What’s
most significant, she provides that mother can leave the principal
to any one she pleases. Don’t you suppose grandma knew it will
naturally come to Dan eventually? She’s really taken care of him,
and at the same time made it appear that he’s cut off with this
thirty-five hundred dollars that’ll last him about a minute. She
did it because she hoped Lena would leave him and get a divorce."</p>

<p>"No, no!" Mrs. Oliphant cried out. "Mother wouldn’t have had
such a wicked thought. She had the strictest ideas about morality
I ever——"</p>

<p>"Yes, she did," Harlan agreed. "Yet that’s just what she planned.
You may not see it, but it’s as plain to me as if she had written
it in her will. And there’s something more than that in it, too."</p>

<p>"What is it?" Mr. Oliphant inquired skeptically. "What is the
something more that’s hidden from every eye but yours?"</p>

<p>Harlan reddened and failed to reply at once;—then he said with
a reluctant humour: "I’m afraid she’s played it rather low down
on me, sir."</p>

<p>"What!" Mr. Oliphant stared at him. "You call leaving you five
or six hundred thousand dollars playing it rather low down?"</p>

<p>"You’d say it’s a fantastic view, would you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe I should—considerably!"</p>

<p>"Maybe so," Harlan said. "Yet there seems some ground for it.
Grandma knew—that is, I mean she thought—she thought that I had
certain hopes about Martha myself, and she told me pretty plainly
I’d better keep out of the way. Well, she’s put me in a fine light
before Martha, hasn’t she? Here’s Dan, all his life supposed to
be the favourite, with great expectations, and now he’s cut off
with a shilling, and I get it all! In the eyes of a sympathetic
woman who’s always liked him best anyhow, isn’t he the suffering
hero, and don’t I play the rôle of the brother that undermined
him and supplanted him?"</p>

<p>"That’s nonsense," his father said a little irritably. "You don’t
suppose your grandmother deliberately——"</p>

<p>"I don’t suppose she meant unkindly by me," Harlan interrupted.
"Naturally I don’t suppose my grandmother made me her residuary
legatee for the purpose of injuring me. Probably she thought I’d
be consoled by what she was leaving me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Harlan!" his mother cried reproachfully.</p>

<p>But Harlan only smiled at her faintly and did not defend himself.</p>

<p>"So Lena will leave Dan now, will she?" Mr. Oliphant inquired,
with satire. "And then Dan will proceed in freedom to carry out
the rest of this programme?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; not at all."</p>

<p>"But haven’t you just been saying——"</p>

<p>"I’ve been saying what I see in the will," Harlan explained.
"I’ve been saying what grandma hoped, and I think she was pretty
shrewd, but I believe that her dislike of Lena led her into an
error. I haven’t the remotest idea that Lena will leave her husband."</p>

<p>"I see!" Mr. Oliphant returned sharply. "You mean you haven’t
any fantastic ideas yourself, Harlan; it’s only your grandmother
who had them, though she’s just left you a fortune!"</p>

<p>His tone was hard; and Harlan, looking at him gravely, pointed
out a significance in the hardness. "There it is, sir. Already
I’m a little more unpopular with you than usual, because you can’t
help sympathizing with Dan and feeling that I’ve got his share
as well as my own. Don’t you think other people may feel the same
way?"</p>

<p>For a moment Mr. Oliphant looked slightly disconcerted by this
bit of analysis, but, recovering himself, "Not necessarily," he
replied. "I’m not criticizing you because of your inheritance,
but because it doesn’t seem fair in you to impute all this surreptitious
planning to a person who’s shown such generosity to you. You don’t
seem to realize——"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I do," Harlan interrupted. "Mother spoke of my not seeming
elated and praised me for it. I don’t deserve her praise. You
see, if I don’t feel much elated just at first it’s because to
my mind the whole thing is another example of how much better
grandma liked Dan and how much better other people are going to
go on liking him. Naturally, I’m glad to have the money; I know
she meant well by me, and I appreciate it. I appreciate another
thing, too. One of the reasons she left it to me was that she
knew I put what I had from grandfather into the safest type of
municipal bonds. She knew that I’d understand the value of whatever
she left me. She knew I’d take care of it."</p>

<p>He put a slight but sharp and dry emphasis upon the final words,
"She knew I’d take care of it," so that there was a hint of warning
in them; and he added, making this note more definite: "She was
right about that, because I <em>will</em> take care of it."</p>

<p>Upon that, he struck both arms of his chair decisively with the
palms of his hands, and, as a continuation of this action, rose
and turned to the window, his back to his parents. They glanced
nervously at each other, each knowing that the other had the same
hope and the same doubt; the glance they exchanged meaning, "<em>You</em>
speak to him about it!" Mr. Oliphant yielded and coughed uncomfortably
as a prelude, but his wife impulsively decided to begin the task
for him.</p>

<p>"Harlan, dear," she said, "your father and I both know you’ve
always acted conscientiously in everything you’ve ever done; and
of course what mother’s given you ought to be regarded as a sacred
trust. You’re right to say you’ll take care if it, but we feel—I
mean your father and I feel——" She faltered, and appealed to her
husband: "You <em>do</em> feel that perhaps—perhaps under the
circumstances—perhaps——"</p>

<p>"Yes," Mr. Oliphant said as she came to a helpless stop;—"I think
under the circumstances Harlan might—might properly see fit to——"
But here he, too, hesitated and seemed unable to continue.</p>

<p>Their son, however, understood them perfectly, and turned sharply
to face them. "Of course I knew you’d ask it," he said, and an
old bitterness, long held down within him, came to the surface.
"I knew you wanted me to let Dan have even that twenty-five thousand
dollars grandfather left me. You really wanted me to let him throw
it away along with his own, though you never spoke out and asked
me to do it. Martha Shelby did, though. <em>She</em> spoke out
plainly enough! The fact that grandfather gave it to me never
entered her head. She only thought I was miserly for not putting
it into Dan’s hands to be squandered. That’s what she thought,
and I’ve understood all along that my mother and my father had
a great deal the same feeling."</p>

<p>"No, no," his mother protested, for the bitterness in his voice
had increased as he spoke. "We never reproached you, dear."</p>

<p>"No, not in words maybe."</p>

<p>"No, not in any way," she said. "It was right of you to take
care of it, and you’d be right now to take care of what you’ll
have. Your father and I only mean that now you have so <em>much</em>——"</p>

<p>"Now that I have so <em>much</em>," Harlan echoed, "I ought to
throw away part of it, even though grandma’s trusted me to save
it from just this very wastage and to take care of every bit of
it?"</p>

<p>"No, no; it isn’t that," Mrs. Oliphant said; and with pathetically
naïve artfulness she changed the basis of her appeal. "But you
know, dear, you were just telling us how much Martha had wanted
you to help Dan—she’s always been such a devoted friend of his—and
you said that after she hears about mother’s bequest to you, she
may take it as a kind of supplanting your brother, and it would
be harder than ever for you to make her fond of you; so don’t
you see—don’t you see what a splendid effect it would have on
her now, when you’ve got so much, dear, and could spare it—don’t
you see, if you’d—if you’d——"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," Harlan said grimly. "You think Martha might even
admire me enough to marry me, if I’d say to Dan: ‘Here! I won’t
accept all this that should have been yours. Here’s half of it.’"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she cried, "I didn’t mean half of it; I only meant
you might——"</p>

<p>"No," Harlan said; "not <em>any</em>, mother—not a dime! I won’t
impress Martha with a pose. I don’t want her or anybody else to
like me because of a pose."</p>

<p>"Would it be a pose," Mr. Oliphant asked gravely, "to help your
brother?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn’t it?" Harlan returned as gravely. "Isn’t it a pose to
do something that isn’t natural to you, simply to make a woman
admire you? I’d call that a pose, myself, though you may have
another definition of the word. I’m not caring to get admiration
that way, sir."</p>

<p>"All right," his father said, nodding, as the fragile edifice
of Mrs. Oliphant’s gentle cunning was thus dispersed upon the
air. "I should say you had the right spirit there. But why need
it be an attitude? Wouldn’t you really <em>like</em> to help Dan
out a little, Harlan?"</p>

<p>Harlan sighed. "Not in a failure, sir. First and last he’s had
a pretty long chance to prove what he could do with his Addition,
and he’s no nearer succeeding to-day than he was when he began.
Instead, he’s lost all his money and all his time. All he’s done
was to spoil a farm."</p>

<p>"But if he had some really substantial assistance, it’s not absolutely
impossible he might——"</p>

<p>"No, sir," Harlan said definitely; "I don’t believe in it, and
I’ll never do it. I didn’t want to supplant him. I didn’t ask
for what grandma’s done for me; I never did one thing to get it,
or for the purpose of making her like me; and, as a matter of
fact, she didn’t do it because she liked me. But she did know
I’d take care of it, and I’m going to prove she was right about
that, anyhow. I won’t throw any of it away on an attitude to make
Martha Shelby think well of me. Of course she’ll be all the surer
she’s right about me, now that I don’t do anything for him, though
I have so <em>much</em>!" He picked up the copy of Mrs. Savage’s
will from the table where his father had left it, and, sitting
down again, prepared to look over it; but, as he placed in position
the eye-glasses already necessary to him when he read, he sent
a sidelong glance toward his parents, a glance in which there
was the bitterness of an ancient pain. "I wouldn’t even throw
any of it away to make my father and mother like me a little better,
either," he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oliphant cried out reproachfully: "Oh, Harlan!" and she
would have said more; but her husband shook his head at her, and
she was silent. Harlan finished his reading, set the manuscript
down upon the table, and went away without speaking again, so
that his parents were left to themselves and a thoughtful, somewhat
melancholy silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oliphant broke it diffidently. "You don’t think mother ever
dreamed that——"</p>

<p>"That he might help Dan? No; not with the Addition. Harlan’s
right when he says that’s just what she trusted him not to do."</p>

<p>"I didn’t mean that," Mrs. Oliphant explained. "I mean—you know
what he said about mother’s hoping—I mean his saying he thought
mother had those wild ideas about Lena’s going away and—and Martha
Shelby——"</p>

<p>"No," her husband said. "No; I don’t think so. It seems unlikely.
I don’t think your mother would have——"</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. Oliphant assented thoughtfully. "I can’t believe she
would. Of course there isn’t any way of being sure—now."</p>

<p>"No; but it’s probably just Harlan’s imagination. He’s sensitive,
and that always means imaginative, too. I don’t think we need
to dwell on it."</p>

<p>"I suppose not. Especially as she <em>couldn’t</em> have meant
anything like that. You don’t think she <em>could</em>, do you,
dear?"</p>

<p>"No, no; I don’t think so," he answered. "We’d better be worrying
over other matters, I suspect."</p>

<p>"You mean about getting Harlan to help Dan out?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Of course I can do something," she said. "I’ll help all I can
with the income mother’s given me; we’ve always managed to live
very comfortably without it. But Harlan—why, I almost believe
Dan could make a success of the Addition, if Harlan would do something
substantial about it. Yes; we ought to be able to think of <em>some</em>
way to get him to do it." </p>
