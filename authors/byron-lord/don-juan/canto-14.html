If from great nature's or our own abyss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thought we could but snatch a certainty,<br/>
Perhaps mankind might find the path they miss&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then 't would spoil much good philosophy.<br/>
One system eats another up, and this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Much as old Saturn ate his progeny;<br/>
For when his pious consort gave him stones<br/>
In lieu of sons, of these he made no bones.

</p>
<p>
But System doth reverse the Titan's breakfast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And eats her parents, albeit the digestion<br/>
Is difficult. Pray tell me, can you make fast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After due search, your faith to any question?<br/>
Look back o'er ages, ere unto the stake fast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You bind yourself, and call some mode the best one.<br/>
Nothing more true than not to trust your senses;<br/>
And yet what are your other evidences?

</p>
<p>
For me, I know nought; nothing I deny,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Admit, reject, contemn; and what know you,<br/>
Except perhaps that you were born to die?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And both may after all turn out untrue.<br/>
An age may come, Font of Eternity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When nothing shall be either old or new.<br/>
Death, so call'd, is a thing which makes men weep,<br/>
And yet a third of life is pass'd in sleep.

</p>
<p>
A sleep without dreams, after a rough day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of toil, is what we covet most; and yet<br/>
How clay shrinks back from more quiescent clay!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The very Suicide that pays his debt<br/>
At once without instalments (an old way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of paying debts, which creditors regret)<br/>
Lets out impatiently his rushing breath,<br/>
Less from disgust of life than dread of death.

</p>
<p>
'T is round him, near him, here, there, every where;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there 's a courage which grows out of fear,<br/>
Perhaps of all most desperate, which will dare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst to know it:&mdash;when the mountains rear<br/>
Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You look down o'er the precipice, and drear<br/>
The gulf of rock yawns,&mdash;you can't gaze a minute<br/>
Without an awful wish to plunge within it.

</p>
<p>
'T is true, you don't&mdash;but, pale and struck with terror,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Retire: but look into your past impression!<br/>
And you will find, though shuddering at the mirror<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your own thoughts, in all their self-confession,<br/>
The lurking bias, be it truth or error,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the unknown; a secret prepossession,<br/>
To plunge with all your fears&mdash;but where? You know not,<br/>
And that's the reason why you do&mdash;or do not.

</p>
<p>
But what 's this to the purpose? you will say.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gent. reader, nothing; a mere speculation,<br/>
For which my sole excuse is&mdash;'t is my way;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes with and sometimes without occasion<br/>
I write what 's uppermost, without delay:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This narrative is not meant for narration,<br/>
But a mere airy and fantastic basis,<br/>
To build up common things with common places.

</p>
<p>
You know, or don't know, that great Bacon saith,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fling up a straw, 't will show the way the wind blows;'<br/>
And such a straw, borne on by human breath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is poesy, according as the mind glows;<br/>
A paper kite which flies 'twixt life and death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow which the onward soul behind throws:<br/>
And mine 's a bubble, not blown up for praise,<br/>
But just to play with, as an infant plays.

</p>
<p>
The world is all before me&mdash;or behind;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have seen a portion of that same,<br/>
And quite enough for me to keep in mind;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,<br/>
To the great pleasure of our friends, mankind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who like to mix some slight alloy with fame;<br/>
For I was rather famous in my time,<br/>
Until I fairly knock'd it up with rhyme.

</p>
<p>
I have brought this world about my ears, and eke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The other; that 's to say, the clergy, who<br/>
Upon my head have bid their thunders break<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In pious libels by no means a few.<br/>
And yet I can't help scribbling once a week,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiring old readers, nor discovering new.<br/>
In youth I wrote because my mind was full,<br/>
And now because I feel it growing dull.

</p>
<p>
But 'why then publish?'<br/>
&mdash;There are no rewards<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fame or profit when the world grows weary.<br/>
I ask in turn,<br/>
&mdash;Why do you play at cards?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why drink? Why read?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;To make some hour less dreary.<br/>
It occupies me to turn back regards<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On what I 've seen or ponder'd, sad or cheery;<br/>
And what I write I cast upon the stream,<br/>
To swim or sink<br/>
&mdash;I have had at least my dream.

</p>
<p>
I think that were I certain of success,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I hardly could compose another line:<br/>
So long I 've battled either more or less,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That no defeat can drive me from the Nine.<br/>
This feeling 't is not easy to express,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet 't is not affected, I opine.<br/>
In play, there are two pleasures for your choosing&mdash;<br/>
The one is winning, and the other losing.

</p>
<p>
Besides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She gathers a repertory of facts,<br/>
Of course with some reserve and slight restriction,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But mostly sings of human things and acts&mdash;<br/>
And that 's one cause she meets with contradiction;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For too much truth, at first sight, ne'er attracts;<br/>
And were her object only what 's call'd glory,<br/>
With more ease too she 'd tell a different story.

</p>
<p>
Love, war, a tempest&mdash;surely there 's variety;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;<br/>
A bird's-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A slight glance thrown on men of every station.<br/>
If you have nought else, here 's at least satiety<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Both in performance and in preparation;<br/>
And though these lines should only line portmanteaus,<br/>
Trade will be all the better for these Cantos.

</p>
<p>
The portion of this world which I at present<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have taken up to fill the following sermon,<br/>
Is one of which there 's no description recent.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why is easy to determine:<br/>
Although it seems both prominent and pleasant,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,<br/>
A dull and family likeness through all ages,<br/>
Of no great promise for poetic pages.

</p>
<p>
With much to excite, there 's little to exalt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing that speaks to all men and all times;<br/>
A sort of varnish over every fault;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;<br/>
Factitious passions, wit without much salt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A want of that true nature which sublimes<br/>
Whate'er it shows with truth; a smooth monotony<br/>
Of character, in those at least who have got any.

</p>
<p>
Sometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;<br/>
But then the roll-call draws them back afraid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they must be or seem what they were: still<br/>
Doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But when of the first sight you have had your fill,<br/>
It palls&mdash;at least it did so upon me,<br/>
This paradise of pleasure and ennui.

</p>
<p>
When we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drest, voted, shone, and, may be, something more;<br/>
With dandies dined; heard senators declaiming;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen beauties brought to market by the score,<br/>
Sad rakes to sadder husbands chastely taming;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There 's little left but to be bored or bore.<br/>
Witness those 'ci-devant jeunes hommes' who stem<br/>
The stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.

</p>
<p>
'T is said&mdash;indeed a general complaint&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That no one has succeeded in describing<br/>
The monde, exactly as they ought to paint:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say, that authors only snatch, by bribing<br/>
The porter, some slight scandals strange and quaint,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To furnish matter for their moral gibing;<br/>
And that their books have but one style in common&mdash;<br/>
My lady's prattle, filter'd through her woman.

</p>
<p>
But this can't well be true, just now; for writers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are grown of the beau monde a part potential:<br/>
I 've seen them balance even the scale with fighters,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially when young, for that 's essential.<br/>
Why do their sketches fail them as inditers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what they deem themselves most consequential,<br/>
The real portrait of the highest tribe?<br/>
'T is that, in fact, there 's little to describe.

</p>
<p>
'Haud ignara loquor;' these are Nugae, 'quarum<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pars parva fui,' but still art and part.<br/>
Now I could much more easily sketch a harem,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,<br/>
Than these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For reasons which I choose to keep apart.<br/>
'Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit&mdash;'<br/>
Which means that vulgar people must not share it.

</p>
<p>
And therefore what I throw off is ideal&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower'd, leaven'd, like a history of freemasons;<br/>
Which bears the same relation to the real,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As Captain Parry's voyage may do to Jason's.<br/>
The grand arcanum 's not for men to see all;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My music has some mystic diapasons;<br/>
And there is much which could not be appreciated<br/>
In any manner by the uninitiated.

</p>
<p>
Alas! worlds fall&mdash;and woman, since she fell'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world (as, since that history less polite<br/>
Than true, hath been a creed so strictly held)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has not yet given up the practice quite.<br/>
Poor thing of usages! coerced, compell'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Victim when wrong, and martyr oft when right,<br/>
Condemn'd to child-bed, as men for their sins<br/>
Have shaving too entail'd upon their chins,&mdash;

</p>
<p>
A daily plague, which in the aggregate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May average on the whole with parturition.<br/>
But as to women, who can penetrate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The real sufferings of their she condition?<br/>
Man's very sympathy with their estate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.<br/>
Their love, their virtue, beauty, education,<br/>
But form good housekeepers, to breed a nation.

</p>
<p>
All this were very well, and can't be better;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But even this is difficult, Heaven knows,<br/>
So many troubles from her birth beset her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such small distinction between friends and foes,<br/>
The gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That&mdash;but ask any woman if she'd choose<br/>
(Take her at thirty, that is) to have been<br/>
Female or male? a schoolboy or a queen?

</p>
<p>
'Petticoat influence' is a great reproach,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which even those who obey would fain be thought<br/>
To fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But since beneath it upon earth we are brought,<br/>
By various joltings of life's hackney coach,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one venerate a petticoat&mdash;<br/>
A garment of a mystical sublimity,<br/>
No matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.

</p>
<p>
Much I respect, and much I have adored,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In my young days, that chaste and goodly veil,<br/>
Which holds a treasure, like a miser's hoard,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And more attracts by all it doth conceal&mdash;<br/>
A golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A loving letter with a mystic seal,<br/>
A cure for grief&mdash;for what can ever rankle<br/>
Before a petticoat and peeping ankle?

</p>
<p>
And when upon a silent, sullen day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sirocco, for example, blowing,<br/>
When even the sea looks dim with all its spray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sulkily the river's ripple 's flowing,<br/>
And the sky shows that very ancient gray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,&mdash;<br/>
'T is pleasant, if then any thing is pleasant,<br/>
To catch a glimpse even of a pretty peasant.

</p>
<p>
We left our heroes and our heroines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In that fair clime which don't depend on climate,<br/>
Quite independent of the Zodiac's signs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though certainly more difficult to rhyme at,<br/>
Because the sun, and stars, and aught that shines,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountains, and all we can be most sublime at,<br/>
Are there oft dull and dreary as a dun&mdash;<br/>
Whether a sky's or tradesman's is all one.

</p>
<p>
An in-door life is less poetical;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of door hath showers, and mists, and sleet,<br/>
With which I could not brew a pastoral.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But be it as it may, a bard must meet<br/>
All difficulties, whether great or small,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To spoil his undertaking or complete,<br/>
And work away like spirit upon matter,<br/>
Embarrass'd somewhat both with fire and water.

</p>
<p>
Juan&mdash;in this respect, at least, like saints&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was all things unto people of all sorts,<br/>
And lived contentedly, without complaints,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In camps, in ships, in cottages, or courts&mdash;<br/>
Born with that happy soul which seldom faints,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mingling modestly in toils or sports.<br/>
He likewise could be most things to all women,<br/>
Without the coxcombry of certain she men.

</p>
<p>
A fox-hunt to a foreigner is strange;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is also subject to the double danger<br/>
Of tumbling first, and having in exchange<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:<br/>
But Juan had been early taught to range<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilds, as doth an Arab turn'd avenger,<br/>
So that his horse, or charger, hunter, hack,<br/>
Knew that he had a rider on his back.

</p>
<p>
And now in this new field, with some applause,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He clear'd hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,<br/>
And never craned, and made but few 'faux pas,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.<br/>
He broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hunting&mdash;for the sagest youth is frail;<br/>
Rode o'er the hounds, it may be, now and then,<br/>
And once o'er several country gentlemen.

</p>
<p>
But on the whole, to general admiration<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He acquitted both himself and horse: the squires<br/>
Marvell'd at merit of another nation;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The boors cried 'Dang it? who 'd have thought it?'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Sires,<br/>
The Nestors of the sporting generation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Swore praises, and recall'd their former fires;<br/>
The huntsman's self relented to a grin,<br/>
And rated him almost a whipper-in.

</p>
<p>
Such were his trophies&mdash;not of spear and shield,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But leaps, and bursts, and sometimes foxes' brushes;<br/>
Yet I must own,&mdash;although in this I yield<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To patriot sympathy a Briton's blushes,&mdash;<br/>
He thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, after a long chase o'er hills, dales, bushes,<br/>
And what not, though he rode beyond all price,<br/>
Ask'd next day, 'If men ever hunted twice?'

</p>
<p>
He also had a quality uncommon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To early risers after a long chase,<br/>
Who wake in winter ere the cock can summon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;December's drowsy day to his dull race,&mdash;<br/>
A quality agreeable to woman,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When her soft, liquid words run on apace,<br/>
Who likes a listener, whether saint or sinner,&mdash;<br/>
He did not fall asleep just after dinner;

</p>
<p>
But, light and airy, stood on the alert,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shone in the best part of dialogue,<br/>
By humouring always what they might assert,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And listening to the topics most in vogue;<br/>
Now grave, now gay, but never dull or pert;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiling but in secret&mdash;cunning rogue!<br/>
He ne'er presumed to make an error clearer;&mdash;<br/>
In short, there never was a better hearer.

</p>
<p>
And then he danced;&mdash;all foreigners excel<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious Angles in the eloquence<br/>
Of pantomime;&mdash;he danced, I say, right well,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With emphasis, and also with good sense&mdash;<br/>
A thing in footing indispensable;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He danced without theatrical pretence,<br/>
Not like a ballet-master in the van<br/>
Of his drill'd nymphs, but like a gentleman.

</p>
<p>
Chaste were his steps, each kept within due bound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And elegance was sprinkled o'er his figure;<br/>
Like swift Camilla, he scarce skimm'd the ground,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And rather held in than put forth his vigour;<br/>
And then he had an ear for music's sound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which might defy a crotchet critic's rigour.<br/>
Such classic pas&mdash;sans flaws&mdash;set off our hero,<br/>
He glanced like a personified Bolero;

</p>
<p>
Or, like a flying Hour before Aurora,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Guido's famous fresco which alone<br/>
Is worth a tour to Rome, although no more a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remnant were there of the old world's sole throne.<br/>
The 'tout ensemble' of his movements wore a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace of the soft ideal, seldom shown,<br/>
And ne'er to be described; for to the dolour<br/>
Of bards and prosers, words are void of colour.

</p>
<p>
No marvel then he was a favourite;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A full-grown Cupid, very much admired;<br/>
A little spoilt, but by no means so quite;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least he kept his vanity retired.<br/>
Such was his tact, he could alike delight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaste, and those who are not so much inspired.<br/>
The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who loved 'tracasserie,'<br/>
Began to treat him with some small 'agacerie.'

</p>
<p>
She was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Desirable, distinguish'd, celebrated<br/>
For several winters in the grand, grand monde.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I 'd rather not say what might be related<br/>
Of her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides there might be falsehood in what 's stated:<br/>
Her late performance had been a dead set<br/>
At Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.

</p>
<p>
This noble personage began to look<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A little black upon this new flirtation;<br/>
But such small licences must lovers brook,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere freedoms of the female corporation.<br/>
Woe to the man who ventures a rebuke!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T will but precipitate a situation<br/>
Extremely disagreeable, but common<br/>
To calculators when they count on woman.

</p>
<p>
The circle smiled, then whisper'd, and then sneer'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Misses bridled, and the matrons frown'd;<br/>
Some hoped things might not turn out as they fear'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some would not deem such women could be found;<br/>
Some ne'er believed one half of what they heard;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some look'd perplex'd, and others look'd profound;<br/>
And several pitied with sincere regret<br/>
Poor Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.

</p>
<p>
But what is odd, none ever named the duke,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, one might think, was something in the affair;<br/>
True, he was absent, and, 't was rumour'd, took<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But small concern about the when, or where,<br/>
Or what his consort did: if he could brook<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her gaieties, none had a right to stare:<br/>
Theirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,<br/>
Which never meets, and therefore can't fall out.

</p>
<p>
But, oh! that I should ever pen so sad a line!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fired with an abstract love of virtue, she,<br/>
My Dian of the Ephesians, Lady Adeline,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Began to think the duchess' conduct free;<br/>
Regretting much that she had chosen so bad a line,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And waxing chiller in her courtesy,<br/>
Look'd grave and pale to see her friend's fragility,<br/>
For which most friends reserve their sensibility.

</p>
<p>
There 's nought in this bad world like sympathy:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is so becoming to the soul and face,<br/>
Sets to soft music the harmonious sigh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And robes sweet friendship in a Brussels lace.<br/>
Without a friend, what were humanity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To hunt our errors up with a good grace?<br/>
Consoling us with&mdash;'Would you had thought twice!<br/>
Ah, if you had but follow'd my advice!'

</p>
<p>
O job! you had two friends: one 's quite enough,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially when we are ill at ease;<br/>
They are but bad pilots when the weather 's rough,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors less famous for their cures than fees.<br/>
Let no man grumble when his friends fall off,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As they will do like leaves at the first breeze:<br/>
When your affairs come round, one way or t' other,<br/>
Go to the coffee-house, and take another.

</p>
<p>
But this is not my maxim: had it been,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some heart-aches had been spared me: yet I care not&mdash;<br/>
I would not be a tortoise in his screen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of stubborn shell, which waves and weather wear not.<br/>
'T is better on the whole to have felt and seen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That which humanity may bear, or bear not:<br/>
'T will teach discernment to the sensitive,<br/>
And not to pour their ocean in a sieve.

</p>
<p>
Of all the horrid, hideous notes of woe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadder than owl-songs or the midnight blast,<br/>
Is that portentous phrase, 'I told you so,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Utter'd by friends, those prophets of the past,<br/>
Who, 'stead of saying what you now should do,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Own they foresaw that you would fall at last,<br/>
And solace your slight lapse 'gainst 'bonos mores,'<br/>
With a long memorandum of old stories.

</p>
<p>
The Lady Adeline's serene severity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not confined to feeling for her friend,<br/>
Whose fame she rather doubted with posterity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless her habits should begin to mend:<br/>
But Juan also shared in her austerity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But mix'd with pity, pure as e'er was penn'd:<br/>
His inexperience moved her gentle ruth,<br/>
And (as her junior by six weeks) his youth.

</p>
<p>
These forty days' advantage of her years&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hers were those which can face calculation,<br/>
Boldly referring to the list of peers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And noble births, nor dread the enumeration&mdash;<br/>
Gave her a right to have maternal fears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For a young gentleman's fit education,<br/>
Though she was far from that leap year, whose leap,<br/>
In female dates, strikes Time all of a heap.

</p>
<p>
This may be fix'd at somewhere before thirty&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Say seven-and-twenty; for I never knew<br/>
The strictest in chronology and virtue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance beyond, while they could pass for new.<br/>
O Time! why dost not pause? Thy scythe, so dirty<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With rust, should surely cease to hack and hew.<br/>
Reset it; shave more smoothly, also slower,<br/>
If but to keep thy credit as a mower.

</p>
<p>
But Adeline was far from that ripe age,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose ripeness is but bitter at the best:<br/>
'T was rather her experience made her sage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For she had seen the world and stood its test,<br/>
As I have said in<br/>
&mdash;I forget what page;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My Muse despises reference, as you have guess'd<br/>
By this time;&mdash;but strike six from seven-and-twenty,<br/>
And you will find her sum of years in plenty.

</p>
<p>
At sixteen she came out; presented, vaunted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She put all coronets into commotion:<br/>
At seventeen, too, the world was still enchanted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new Venus of their brilliant ocean:<br/>
At eighteen, though below her feet still panted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A hecatomb of suitors with devotion,<br/>
She had consented to create again<br/>
That Adam, call'd 'The happiest of men.'

</p>
<p>
Since then she had sparkled through three glowing winters,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Admired, adored; but also so correct,<br/>
That she had puzzled all the acutest hinters,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the apparel of being circumspect:<br/>
They could not even glean the slightest splinters<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From off the marble, which had no defect.<br/>
She had also snatch'd a moment since her marriage<br/>
To bear a son and heir&mdash;and one miscarriage.

</p>
<p>
Fondly the wheeling fire-flies flew around her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those little glitterers of the London night;<br/>
But none of these possess'd a sting to wound her&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a pitch beyond a coxcomb's flight.<br/>
Perhaps she wish'd an aspirant profounder;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But whatsoe'er she wish'd, she acted right;<br/>
And whether coldness, pride, or virtue dignify<br/>
A woman, so she 's good, what does it signify?

</p>
<p>
I hate a motive, like a lingering bottle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which with the landlord makes too long a stand,<br/>
Leaving all-claretless the unmoisten'd throttle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially with politics on hand;<br/>
I hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand;<br/>
I hate it, as I hate an argument,<br/>
A laureate's ode, or servile peer's 'content.'

</p>
<p>
'T is sad to hack into the roots of things,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They are so much intertwisted with the earth;<br/>
So that the branch a goodly verdure flings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I reck not if an acorn gave it birth.<br/>
To trace all actions to their secret springs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would make indeed some melancholy mirth;<br/>
But this is not at present my concern,<br/>
And I refer you to wise Oxenstiern.

</p>
<p>
With the kind view of saving an eclat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Both to the duchess and diplomatist,<br/>
The Lady Adeline, as soon 's she saw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Juan was unlikely to resist<br/>
(For foreigners don't know that a faux pas<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In England ranks quite on a different list<br/>
From those of other lands unblest with juries,<br/>
Whose verdict for such sin a certain cure is);&mdash;

</p>
<p>
The Lady Adeline resolved to take<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such measures as she thought might best impede<br/>
The farther progress of this sad mistake.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought with some simplicity indeed;<br/>
But innocence is bold even at the stake,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And simple in the world, and doth not need<br/>
Nor use those palisades by dames erected,<br/>
Whose virtue lies in never being detected.

</p>
<p>
It was not that she fear'd the very worst:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His Grace was an enduring, married man,<br/>
And was not likely all at once to burst<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a scene, and swell the clients' clan<br/>
Of Doctors' Commons: but she dreaded first<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of her Grace's talisman,<br/>
And next a quarrel (as he seem'd to fret)<br/>
With Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.

</p>
<p>
Her Grace, too, pass'd for being an intrigante,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And somewhat mechante in her amorous sphere;<br/>
One of those pretty, precious plagues, which haunt<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A lover with caprices soft and dear,<br/>
That like to make a quarrel, when they can't<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Find one, each day of the delightful year;<br/>
Bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,<br/>
And&mdash;what is worst of all&mdash;won't let you go:

</p>
<p>
The sort of thing to turn a young man's head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or make a Werter of him in the end.<br/>
No wonder then a purer soul should dread<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This sort of chaste liaison for a friend;<br/>
It were much better to be wed or dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than wear a heart a woman loves to rend.<br/>
'T is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,<br/>
If that a 'bonne fortune' be really 'bonne.'

</p>
<p>
And first, in the o'erflowing of her heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which really knew or thought it knew no guile,<br/>
She call'd her husband now and then apart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade him counsel Juan. With a smile<br/>
Lord Henry heard her plans of artless art<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wean Don Juan from the siren's wile;<br/>
And answer'd, like a statesman or a prophet,<br/>
In such guise that she could make nothing of it.

</p>
<p>
Firstly, he said, 'he never interfered<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In any body's business but the king's:'<br/>
Next, that 'he never judged from what appear'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without strong reason, of those sort of things:'<br/>
Thirdly, that 'Juan had more brain than beard,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And was not to be held in leading strings;'<br/>
And fourthly, what need hardly be said twice,<br/>
'That good but rarely came from good advice.'

</p>
<p>
And, therefore, doubtless to approve the truth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the last axiom, he advised his spouse<br/>
To leave the parties to themselves, forsooth&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least as far as bienseance allows:<br/>
That time would temper Juan's faults of youth;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That young men rarely made monastic vows;<br/>
That opposition only more attaches&mdash;<br/>
But here a messenger brought in despatches:

</p>
<p>
And being of the council call'd 'the Privy,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Henry walk'd into his cabinet,<br/>
To furnish matter for some future Livy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell how he reduced the nation's debt;<br/>
And if their full contents I do not give ye,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because I do not know them yet;<br/>
But I shall add them in a brief appendix,<br/>
To come between mine epic and its index.

</p>
<p>
But ere he went, he added a slight hint,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Another gentle common-place or two,<br/>
Such as are coin'd in conversation's mint,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pass, for want of better, though not new:<br/>
Then broke his packet, to see what was in 't,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And having casually glanced it through,<br/>
Retired; and, as went out, calmly kiss'd her,<br/>
Less like a young wife than an aged sister.

</p>
<p>
He was a cold, good, honourable man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Proud of his birth, and proud of every thing;<br/>
A goodly spirit for a state divan,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure fit to walk before a king;<br/>
Tall, stately, form'd to lead the courtly van<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On birthdays, glorious with a star and string;<br/>
The very model of a chamberlain&mdash;<br/>
And such I mean to make him when I reign.

</p>
<p>
But there was something wanting on the whole&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what, and therefore cannot tell&mdash;<br/>
Which pretty women&mdash;the sweet souls!&mdash;call soul.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Certes it was not body; he was well<br/>
Proportion'd, as a poplar or a pole,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A handsome man, that human miracle;<br/>
And in each circumstance of love or war<br/>
Had still preserved his perpendicular.

</p>
<p>
Still there was something wanting, as I 've said&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That undefinable 'Je ne scais quoi,'<br/>
Which, for what I know, may of yore have led<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Homer's Iliad, since it drew to Troy<br/>
The Greek Eve, Helen, from the Spartan's bed;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though on the whole, no doubt, the Dardan boy<br/>
Was much inferior to King Menelaus:&mdash;<br/>
But thus it is some women will betray us.

</p>
<p>
There is an awkward thing which much perplexes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless like wise Tiresias we had proved<br/>
By turns the difference of the several sexes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither can show quite how they would be loved.<br/>
The sensual for a short time but connects us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentimental boasts to be unmoved;<br/>
But both together form a kind of centaur,<br/>
Upon whose back 't is better not to venture.

</p>
<p>
A something all-sufficient for the heart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that for which the sex are always seeking:<br/>
But how to fill up that same vacant part?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There lies the rub&mdash;and this they are but weak in.<br/>
Frail mariners afloat without a chart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They run before the wind through high seas breaking;<br/>
And when they have made the shore through every shock,<br/>
'T is odd, or odds, it may turn out a rock.

</p>
<p>
There is a flower call'd 'Love in Idleness,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For which see Shakspeare's everblooming garden;&mdash;<br/>
I will not make his great description less,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And beg his British godship's humble pardon,<br/>
If in my extremity of rhyme's distress,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I touch a single leaf where he is warden;&mdash;<br/>
But though the flower is different, with the French<br/>
Or Swiss Rousseau, cry 'Voila la Pervenche!'

</p>
<p>
Eureka! I have found it! What I mean<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To say is, not that love is idleness,<br/>
But that in love such idleness has been<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An accessory, as I have cause to guess.<br/>
Hard labour's an indifferent go-between;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your men of business are not apt to express<br/>
Much passion, since the merchant-ship, the Argo,<br/>
Convey'd Medea as her supercargo.

</p>
<p>
'Beatus ille procul!' from 'negotiis,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saith Horace; the great little poet 's wrong;<br/>
His other maxim, 'Noscitur a sociis,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is much more to the purpose of his song;<br/>
Though even that were sometimes too ferocious,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless good company be kept too long;<br/>
But, in his teeth, whate'er their state or station,<br/>
Thrice happy they who have an occupation!

</p>
<p>
Adam exchanged his Paradise for ploughing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eve made up millinery with fig leaves&mdash;<br/>
The earliest knowledge from the tree so knowing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, that the church receives:<br/>
And since that time it need not cost much showing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That many of the ills o'er which man grieves,<br/>
And still more women, spring from not employing<br/>
Some hours to make the remnant worth enjoying.

</p>
<p>
And hence high life is oft a dreary void,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A rack of pleasures, where we must invent<br/>
A something wherewithal to be annoy'd.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bards may sing what they please about Content;<br/>
Contented, when translated, means but cloy'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hence arise the woes of sentiment,<br/>
Blue devils, and blue-stockings, and romances<br/>
Reduced to practice, and perform'd like dances.

</p>
<p>
I do declare, upon an affidavit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Romances I ne'er read like those I have seen;<br/>
Nor, if unto the world I ever gave it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would some believe that such a tale had been:<br/>
But such intent I never had, nor have it;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some truths are better kept behind a screen,<br/>
Especially when they would look like lies;<br/>
I therefore deal in generalities.

</p>
<p>
'An oyster may be cross'd in love,'&mdash;and why?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he mopeth idly in his shell,<br/>
And heaves a lonely subterraqueous sigh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Much as a monk may do within his cell:<br/>
And a-propos of monks, their piety<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With sloth hath found it difficult to dwell;<br/>
Those vegetables of the Catholic creed<br/>
Are apt exceedingly to run to seed.

</p>
<p>
O Wilberforce! thou man of black renown,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose merit none enough can sing or say,<br/>
Thou hast struck one immense Colossus down,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou moral Washington of Africa!<br/>
But there 's another little thing, I own,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which you should perpetrate some summer's day,<br/>
And set the other halt of earth to rights;<br/>
You have freed the blacks&mdash;now pray shut up the whites.

</p>
<p>
Shut up the bald-coot bully Alexander!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;<br/>
Teach them that 'sauce for goose is sauce for gander,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ask them how they like to be in thrall?<br/>
Shut up each high heroic salamander,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who eats fire gratis (since the pay 's but small);<br/>
Shut up&mdash;no, not the King, but the Pavilion,<br/>
Or else 't will cost us all another million.

</p>
<p>
Shut up the world at large, let Bedlam out;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you will be perhaps surprised to find<br/>
All things pursue exactly the same route,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As now with those of soi-disant sound mind.<br/>
This I could prove beyond a single doubt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were there a jot of sense among mankind;<br/>
But till that point d'appui is found, alas!<br/>
Like Archimedes, I leave earth as 't was.

</p>
<p>
Our gentle Adeline had one defect&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;<br/>
Her conduct had been perfectly correct,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As she had seen nought claiming its expansion.<br/>
A wavering spirit may be easier wreck'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because 't is frailer, doubtless, than a stanch one;<br/>
But when the latter works its own undoing,<br/>
Its inner crash is like an earthquake's ruin.

</p>
<p>
She loved her lord, or thought so; but that love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost her an effort, which is a sad toil,<br/>
The stone of Sisyphus, if once we move<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our feelings 'gainst the nature of the soil.<br/>
She had nothing to complain of, or reprove,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No bickerings, no connubial turmoil:<br/>
Their union was a model to behold,<br/>
Serene and noble,&mdash;conjugal, but cold.

</p>
<p>
There was no great disparity of years,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though much in temper; but they never clash'd:<br/>
They moved like stars united in their spheres,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or like the Rhone by Leman's waters wash'd,<br/>
Where mingled and yet separate appears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The river from the lake, all bluely dash'd<br/>
Through the serene and placid glassy deep,<br/>
Which fain would lull its river-child to sleep.

</p>
<p>
Now when she once had ta'en an interest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In any thing, however she might flatter<br/>
Herself that her intentions were the best,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Intense intentions are a dangerous matter:<br/>
Impressions were much stronger than she guess'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And gather'd as they run like growing water<br/>
Upon her mind; the more so, as her breast<br/>
Was not at first too readily impress'd.

</p>
<p>
But when it was, she had that lurking demon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of double nature, and thus doubly named&mdash;<br/>
Firmness yclept in heroes, kings, and seamen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, when they succeed; but greatly blamed<br/>
As obstinacy, both in men and women,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whene'er their triumph pales, or star is tamed:&mdash;<br/>
And 't will perplex the casuist in morality<br/>
To fix the due bounds of this dangerous quality.

</p>
<p>
Had Buonaparte won at Waterloo,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been firmness; now 't is pertinacity:<br/>
Must the event decide between the two?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave it to your people of sagacity<br/>
To draw the line between the false and true,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If such can e'er be drawn by man's capacity:<br/>
My business is with Lady Adeline,<br/>
Who in her way too was a heroine.

</p>
<p>
She knew not her own heart; then how should I?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think not she was then in love with Juan:<br/>
If so, she would have had the strength to fly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild sensation, unto her a new one:<br/>
She merely felt a common sympathy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I will not say it was a false or true one)<br/>
In him, because she thought he was in danger,&mdash;<br/>
Her husband's friend, her own, young, and a stranger,

</p>
<p>
She was, or thought she was, his friend&mdash;and this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the farce of friendship, or romance<br/>
Of Platonism, which leads so oft amiss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ladies who have studied friendship but in France,<br/>
Or Germany, where people purely kiss.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To thus much Adeline would not advance;<br/>
But of such friendship as man's may to man be<br/>
She was as capable as woman can be.

</p>
<p>
No doubt the secret influence of the sex<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there, as also in the ties of blood,<br/>
An innocent predominance annex,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tune the concord to a finer mood.<br/>
If free from passion, which all friendship checks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And your true feelings fully understood,<br/>
No friend like to a woman earth discovers,<br/>
So that you have not been nor will be lovers.

</p>
<p>
Love bears within its breast the very germ<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of change; and how should this be otherwise?<br/>
That violent things more quickly find a term<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is shown through nature's whole analogies;<br/>
And how should the most fierce of all be firm?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you have endless lightning in the skies?<br/>
Methinks Love's very title says enough:<br/>
How should 'the tender passion' e'er be tough?

</p>
<p>
Alas! by all experience, seldom yet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I merely quote what I have heard from many)<br/>
Had lovers not some reason to regret<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The passion which made Solomon a zany.<br/>
I 've also seen some wives (not to forget<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The marriage state, the best or worst of any)<br/>
Who were the very paragons of wives,<br/>
Yet made the misery of at least two lives.

</p>
<p>
I 've also seen some female friends ( 't is odd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But true&mdash;as, if expedient, I could prove)<br/>
That faithful were through thick and thin, abroad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At home, far more than ever yet was Love&mdash;<br/>
Who did not quit me when Oppression trod<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon me; whom no scandal could remove;<br/>
Who fought, and fight, in absence, too, my battles,<br/>
Despite the snake Society's loud rattles.

</p>
<p>
Whether Don Juan and chaste Adeline<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew friends in this or any other sense,<br/>
Will be discuss'd hereafter, I opine:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At present I am glad of a pretence<br/>
To leave them hovering, as the effect is fine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And keeps the atrocious reader in suspense;<br/>
The surest way for ladies and for books<br/>
To bait their tender, or their tenter, hooks.

</p>
<p>
Whether they rode, or walk'd, or studied Spanish<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To read Don Quixote in the original,<br/>
A pleasure before which all others vanish;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether their talk was of the kind call'd 'small,'<br/>
Or serious, are the topics I must banish<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the next Canto; where perhaps I shall<br/>
Say something to the purpose, and display<br/>
Considerable talent in my way.

</p>
<p>
Above all, I beg all men to forbear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anticipating aught about the matter:<br/>
They 'll only make mistakes about the fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Juan too, especially the latter.<br/>
And I shall take a much more serious air<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than I have yet done, in this epic satire.<br/>
It is not clear that Adeline and Juan<br/>
Will fall; but if they do, 't will be their ruin.

</p>
<p>
But great things spring from little:<br/>
&mdash;Would you think,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That in our youth, as dangerous a passion<br/>
As e'er brought man and woman to the brink<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ruin, rose from such a slight occasion,<br/>
As few would ever dream could form the link<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such a sentimental situation?<br/>
You 'll never guess, I 'll bet you millions, milliards&mdash;<br/>
It all sprung from a harmless game at billiards.

</p>
<p>
'T is strange,&mdash;but true; for truth is always strange;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stranger than fiction; if it could be told,<br/>
How much would novels gain by the exchange!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How differently the world would men behold!<br/>
How oft would vice and virtue places change!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The new world would be nothing to the old,<br/>
If some Columbus of the moral seas<br/>
Would show mankind their souls' antipodes.

</p>
<p>
What 'antres vast and deserts idle' then<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would be discover'd in the human soul!<br/>
What icebergs in the hearts of mighty men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With self-love in the centre as their pole!<br/>
What Anthropophagi are nine of ten<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who hold the kingdoms in control<br/>
Were things but only call'd by their right name,<br/>
Caesar himself would be ashamed of fame.
