<P>
ARNOLD was a little surprised by the curt manner in which
Geoffrey answered him.
<P>
"Has Sir Patrick said any thing unpleasant?" he asked.
<P>
"Sir Patrick has said just what I wanted him to say."
<P>
"No difficulty about the marriage?"
<P>
"None."
<P>
"No fear of Blanche--"
<P>
"She won't ask you to go to Craig Fernie--I'll answer for that!"
He said the words with a strong emphasis on them, took his
brother's letter from the table, snatched up his hat, and went
out.
<P>
His friends, idling on the lawn, hailed him. He passed by them
quickly without answering, without so much as a glance at them
over his shoulder. Arriving at the rose-garden, he stopped and
took out his pipe; then suddenly changed his mind, and turned
back again by another path. There was no certainty, at that hour
of the day, of his being left alone in the rose-garden. He had a
fierce and hungry longing to be by himself; he felt as if he
could have been the death of any body who came and spoke to him
at that moment. With his head down and his brows knit heavily, he
followed the path to see what it ended in. It ended in a
wicket-gate which led into a kitchen-garden. Here he was well out
of the way of interruption: there was nothing to attract visitors
in the kitchen-garden. He went on to a walnut-tree planted in the
middle of the inclosure, with a wooden bench and a broad strip of
turf running round it. After first looking about him, he seated
himself and lit his pipe.
<P>
"I wish it was done!" he said.
<P>
He sat, with his elbows on his knees, smoking and thinking.
Before long the restlessness that had got possession of him
forced him to his feet again. He rose, and paced round and round
the strip of greensward under the walnut-tree, like a wild beast
in a cage.
<P>
What was the meaning of this disturbance in the inner man? Now
that he had committed himself to the betrayal of the friend who
had trusted and served him, was he torn by remorse?
<P>
He was no more torn by remorse than you are while your eye is
passing over this sentence. He was simply in a raging fever of
impatience to see himself safely la nded at the end which he had
in view.
<P>
Why should he feel remorse? All remorse springs, more or less
directly, from the action of two sentiments, which are neither of
them inbred in the natural man. The first of these sentiments is
the product of the respect which we learn to feel for ourselves.
The second is the product of the respect which we learn to feel
for others. In their highest manifestations, these two feelings
exalt themselves, until the first he comes the love of God, and
the second the love of Man. I have injured you, and I repent of
it when it is done. Why should I repent of it if I have gained
something by it for my own self and if you can't make me feel it
by injuring Me? I repent of it because there has been a sense put
into me which tells me that I have sinned against Myself, and
sinned against You. No such sense as that exists among the
instincts of the natural man. And no such feelings as these
troubled Geoffrey Delamayn; for Geoffrey Delamayn was the natural
man.
<P>
When the idea of his scheme had sprung to life in his mind, the
novelty of it had startled him--the enormous daring of it,
suddenly self-revealed, had daunted him. The signs of emotion
which he had betrayed at the writing-table in the library were
the signs of mere mental perturbation, and of nothing more.
<P>
That first vivid impression past, the idea had made itself
familiar to him. He had become composed enough to see such
difficulties as it involved, and such consequences as it implied.
These had fretted him with a passing trouble; for these he
plainly discerned. As for the cruelty and the treachery of the
thing he meditated doing--that consideration never crossed the
limits of his mental view. His position toward the man whose life
he had preserved was the position of a dog. The "noble animal"
who has saved you or me from drowning will fly at your throat or
mine, under certain conditions, ten minutes afterward. Add to the
dog's unreasoning instinct the calculating cunning of a man;
suppose yourself to be in a position to say of some trifling
thing, "Curious! at such and such a time I happened to pick up
such and such an object; and now it turns out to be of some use
to me!"--and there you have an index to the state of Geoffrey's
feeling toward his friend when he recalled the past or when he
contemplated the future. When Arnold had spoken to him at the
critical moment, Arnold had violently irritated him; and that was
all.
<P>
The same impenetrable insensibility, the same primitively natural
condition of the moral being, prevented him from being troubled
by the slightest sense of pity for Anne. "She's out of my way!"
was his first thought. "She's provided for, without any trouble
to Me! was his second. He was not in the least uneasy about her.
Not the slightest doubt crossed his mind that, when once she had
realized her own situation, when once she saw herself placed
between the two alternatives of facing her own ruin or of
claiming Arnold as a last resource, she would claim Arnold. She
would do it as a matter of course; because _he_ would have done
it in her place.
<P>
But he wanted it over. He was wild, as he paced round and round
the walnut-tree, to hurry on the crisis and be done with it. Give
me my freedom to go to the other woman, and to train for the
foot-race--that's what I want. _They_ injured? Confusion to them
both! It's I who am injured by them. They are the worst enemies I
have! They stand in my way.
<P>
How to be rid of them? There was the difficulty. He had made up
his mind to be rid of them that day. How was he to begin?
<P>
There was no picking a quarrel with Arnold, and so beginning with
_him._ This course of proceeding, in Arnold's position toward
Blanche, would lead to a scandal at the outset--a scandal which
would stand in the way of his making the right impression on Mrs.
Glenarm. The woman--lonely and friendless, with her sex and her
position both against her if _she_ tried to make a scandal of
it--the woman was the one to begin with. Settle it at once and
forever with Anne; and leave Arnold to hear of it and deal with
it, sooner or later, no matter which.
<P>
How was he to break it to her before the day was out?
<P>
By going to the inn and openly addressing her to her face as Mrs.
Arnold Brinkworth? No! He had had enough, at Windygates, of
meeting her face to face. The easy way was to write to her, and
send the letter, by the first messenger he could find, to the
inn. She might appear afterward at Windygates; she might follow
him to his brother's; she might appeal to his father. It didn't
matter; he had got the whip-hand of her now. "You are a married
woman." There was the one sufficient answer, which was strong
enough to back him in denying any thing!
<P>
He made out the letter in his own mind. "Something like this
would do," he thought, as he went round and round the
walnut-tree: "You may be surprised not to have seen me. You have
only yourself to thank for it. I know what took place between you
and him at the inn. I have had a lawyer's advice. You are Arnold
Brinkworth's wife. I wish you joy, and good-by forever." Address
those lines: "To Mrs. Arnold Brinkworth;" instruct the messenger
to leave the letter late that night, without waiting for an
answer; start the first thing the next morning for his brother's
house; and behold, it was done!
<P>
But even here there was an obstacle--one last exasperating
obstacle--still in the way.
<P>
If she was known at the inn by any name at all, it was by the
name of Mrs. Silvester. A letter addressed to "Mrs. Arnold
Brinkworth" would probably not be taken in at the door; or if it
was admitted. and if it was actually offered to her, she might
decline to receive it, as a letter not addressed to herself. A
man of readier mental resources would have seen that the name on
the outside of the letter mattered little or nothing, so long as
the contents were read by the person to whom they were addressed.
But Geoffrey's was the order of mind which expresses disturbance
by attaching importance to trifles. He attached an absurd
importance to preserving absolute consistency in his letter,
outside and in. If he declared her to be Arnold Brinkworth's
wife, he must direct to her as Arnold Brinkworth's wife; or who
could tell what the law might say, or what scrape he might not
get himself into by a mere scratch of the pen! The more he
thought of it, the more persuaded he felt of his own cleverness
here, and the hotter and the angrier he grew.
<P>
There is a way out of every thing. And there was surely a way out
of this, if he could only see it.
<P>
He failed to see it. After dealing with all the great
difficulties, the small difficulty proved too much for him. It
struck him that he might have been thinking too long about
it--considering that he was not accustomed to thinking long about
any thing. Besides, his head was getting giddy, with going
mechanically round and round the tree. He irritably turned his
back on the tree and struck into another path: resolved to think
of something else, and then to return to his difficulty, and see
it with a new eye.
<P>
Leaving his thoughts free to wander where they liked, his
thoughts naturally busied themselves with the next subject that
was uppermost in his mind, the subject of the Foot-Race. In a
week's time his arrangements ought to be made. Now, as to the
training, first.
<P>
He decided on employing two trainers this time. One to travel to
Scotland, and begin with him at his brother's house. The other to
take him up, with a fresh eye to him, on his return to London. He
turned over in his mind the performances of the formidable rival
against whom he was to be matched. That other man was the
swiftest runner of the two. The betting in Geoffrey's favor was
betting which calculated on the unparalleled length of the race,
and on Geoffrey's prodigious powers of endurance. How long he
should "wait on" the man? Whereabouts it would be safe to "pick
the man up?" How near the end to calculate the man's exhaustion
to a nicety, and "put on the spurt," and pass him? These were
nice points to decide. The deliberations of a
pedestrian-privy-council would be required to help him under this
heavy responsibility. What men coul d he trust? He could trust A.
and B.--both of them authorities: both of them stanch. Query
about C.? As an authority, unexceptionable; as a man, doubtful.
The problem relating to C. brought him to a standstill--and
declined to be solved, even then. Never mind! he could always
take the advice of A. and B. In the mean time devote C. to the
infernal regions; and, thus dismissing him, try and think of
something else. What else? Mrs. Glenarm? Oh, bother the women!
one of them is the same as another. They all waddle when they
run; and they all fill their stomachs before dinner with sloppy
tea. That's the only difference between women and men--the rest
is nothing but a weak imitation of Us. Devote the women to the
infernal regions; and, so dismissing _them,_ try and think of
something else. Of what? Of something worth thinking of, this
time--of filling another pipe.
<P>
He took out his tobacco-pouch; and suddenly suspended operations
at the moment of opening it.
<P>
What was the object he saw, on the other side of a row of dwarf
pear-trees, away to the right? A woman--evidently a servant by
her dress--stooping down with her back to him, gathering
something: herbs they looked like, as well as he could make them
out at the distance.
<P>
What was that thing hanging by a string at the woman's side? A
slate? Yes. What the deuce did she want with a slate at her side?
He was in search of something to divert his mind--and here it was
found. "Any thing will do for me," he thought. "Suppose I 'chaff'
her a little about her slate?"
<P>
He called to the woman across the pear-trees. "Hullo!"
<P>
The woman raised herself, and advanced toward him slowly--looking
at him, as she came on, with the sunken eyes, the sorrow-stricken
face, the stony tranquillity of Hester Dethridge.
<P>
Geoffrey was staggered. He had not bargained for exchanging the
dullest producible vulgarities of human speech (called in the
language of slang, "Chaff") with such a woman as this.
<P>
"What's that slate for?" he asked, not knowing what else to say,
to begin with.
<P>
The woman lifted her hand to her lips--touched them--and shook
her head.
<P>
"Dumb?"
<P>
The woman bowed her head.
<P>
"Who are you?"
<P>
The woman wrote on her slate, and handed it to him over the
pear-trees. He read:--"I am the cook."
<P>
"Well, cook, were you born dumb?"
<P>
The woman shook her head.
<P>
"What struck you dumb?"
<P>
The woman wrote on her slate:--"A blow."
<P>
"Who gave you the blow?"
<P>
She shook her head.
<P>
"Won't you tell me?"
<P>
She shook her head again.
<P>
Her eyes had rested on his face while he was questioning her;
staring at him, cold, dull, and changeless as the eyes of a
corpse. Firm as his nerves were--dense as he was, on all ordinary
occasions, to any thing in the shape of an imaginative
impression--the eyes of the dumb cook slowly penetrated him with
a stealthy inner chill. Something crept at the marrow of his
back, and shuddered under the roots of his hair. He felt a sudden
impulse to get away from her. It was simple enough; he had only
to say good-morning, and go on. He did say good-morning--but he
never moved. He put his hand into his pocket, and offered her
some money, as a way of making _her_ go. She stretched out her
hand across the pear-trees to take it--and stopped abruptly, with
her arm suspended in the air. A sinister change passed over the
deathlike tranquillity of her face. Her closed lips slowly
dropped apart. Her dull eyes slowly dilated; looked away,
sideways, from _his_ eyes; stopped again; and stared, rigid and
glittering, over his shoulder--stared as if they saw a sight of
horror behind him. "What the devil are you looking at?" he
asked--and turned round quickly, with a start. There was neither
person nor thing to be seen behind him. He turned back again to
the woman. The woman had left him, under the influence of some
sudden panic. She was hurrying away from him--running, old as she
was--flying the sight of him, as if the sight of him was the
pestilence.
<P>
"Mad!" he thought--and turned his back on the sight of her.
<P>
He found himself (hardly knowing how he had got there) under the
walnut-tree once more. In a few minutes his hardy nerves had
recovered themselves--he could laugh over the remembrance of the
strange impression that had been produced on him. "Frightened for
the first time in my life," he thought--"and that by an old
woman! It's time I went into training again, when things have
come to this!"
<P>
He looked at his watch. It was close on the luncheon hour up at
the house; and he had not decided yet what to do about his letter
to Anne. He resolved to decide, then and there.
<P>
The woman--the dumb woman, with the stony face and the horrid
eyes--reappeared in his thoughts, and got in the way of his
decision. Pooh! some crazed old servant, who might once have been
cook; who was kept out of charity now. Nothing more important
than that. No more of her! no more of her!
<P>
He laid himself down on the grass, and gave his mind to the
serious question. How to address Anne as "Mrs. Arnold
Brinkworth?" and how to make sure of her receiving the letter?
<P>
The dumb old woman got in his way again.
<P>
He closed his eyes impatiently, and tried to shut her out in a
darkness of his own making.
<P>
The woman showed herself through the darkness. He saw her, as if
he had just asked her a question, writing on her slate. What she
wrote he failed to make out. It was all over in an instant. He
started up, with a feeling of astonishment at himself--and, at
the same moment his brain cleared with the suddenness of a flash
of light. He saw his way, without a conscious effort on his own
part, through the difficulty that had troubled him. Two
envelopes, of course: an inner one, unsealed, and addressed to
"Mrs. Arnold Brinkworth;" an outer one, sealed, and addressed to
"Mrs. Silvester:" and there was the problem solved! Surely the
simplest problem that had ever puzzled a stupid head.
<P>
Why had he not seen it before? Impossible to say.
<P>
How came he to have seen it now?
<P>
The dumb old woman reappeared in his thoughts--as if the answer
to the question lay in something connected with _her._
<P>
He became alarmed about himself, for the first time in his life.
Had this persistent impression, produced by nothing but a crazy
old woman, any thing to do with the broken health which the
surgeon had talked about? Was his head on the turn? Or had he
smoked too much on an empty stomach, and gone too long (after
traveling all night) without his customary drink of ale?
<P>
He left the garden to put that latter theory to the test
forthwith. The betting would have gone dead against him if the
public had seen him at that moment. He looked haggard and
anxious--and with good reason too. His nervous system had
suddenly forced itself on his notice, without the slightest
previous introduction, and was saying (in an unknown tongue),
Here I am!
<P>
Returning to the purely ornamental part of the grounds, Geoffrey
encountered one of the footmen giving a message to one of the
gardeners. He at once asked for the butler--as the only safe
authority to consult in the present emergency.
<P>
Conducted to the butler's pantry, Geoffrey requested that
functionary to produce a jug of his oldest ale, with appropriate
solid nourishment in the shape of "a hunk of bread and cheese."
<P>
The butler stared. As a form of condescension among the upper
classes this was quite new to him.
<P>
"Luncheon will be ready directly, Sir."
<P>
"What is there for lunch?"
<P>
The butler ran over an appetizing list of good dishes and rare
wines.
<P>
"The devil take your kickshaws!" said Geoffrey. "Give me my old
ale, and my hunk of bread and cheese."
<P>
"Where will you take them, Sir?"
<P>
"Here, to be sure! And the sooner the better."
<P>
The butler issued the necessary orders with all needful alacrity.
He spread the simple refreshment demanded, before his
distinguished guest, in a state of blank bewilderment. Here was a
nobleman's son, and a public celebrity into the bargain, filling
himself with bread and cheese and ale, in at once the most
voracious and the most unpretending manner, at _his_ table! The
butler ventured on a little complimentary familiarity. He smiled,
and touched the betting-book in his breast-pocket. "I've put six
pound on you,  Sir, for the
 Race." "All right, old boy! you shall win your money!" With
those noble words the honorable gentleman clapped him on the
back, and held out his tumbler for some more ale. The butler felt
trebly an Englishman as he filled the foaming glass. Ah! foreign
nations may have their revolutions! foreign aristocracies may
tumble down! The British aristocracy lives in the hearts of the
people, and lives forever!
<P>
"Another!" said Geoffrey, presenting his empty glass. "Here's
luck!" He tossed off his liquor at a draught, and nodded to the
butler, and went out.
<P>
Had the experiment succeeded? Had he proved his own theory about
himself to be right? Not a doubt of it! An empty stomach, and a
determination of tobacco to the head--these were the true causes
of that strange state of mind into which he had fallen in the
kitchen-garden. The dumb woman with the stony face vanished as if
in a mist. He felt nothing now but a comfortable buzzing in his
head, a genial warmth all over him, and an unlimited capacity for
carrying any responsibility that could rest on mortal shoulders.
Geoffrey was himself again.
<P>
He went round toward the library, to write his letter to
Anne--and so have done with that, to begin with. The company had
collected in the library waiting for the luncheon-bell. All were
idly talking; and some would be certain, if he showed himself, to
fasten on _him._ He turned back again, without showing himself.
The only way of writing in peace and quietness would be to wait
until they were all at luncheon, and then return to the library.
The same opportunity would serve also for finding a messenger to
take the letter, without exciting attention, and for going away
afterward, unseen, on a long walk by himself. An absence of two
or three hours would cast the necessary dust in Arnold's eyes;
for it would be certainly interpreted by him as meaning absence
at an interview with Anne.
<P>
He strolled idly through the grounds, farther and farther away
from the house.
<P>
<P>
<P>
The talk in the library--aimless and empty enough, for the most
part--was talk to the purpose, in one corner of the room, in
which Sir Patrick and Blanche were sitting together.
<P>
"Uncle! I have been watching you for the last minute or two."
<P>
"At my age, Blanche? that is paying me a very pretty compliment."
<P>
"Do you know what I have seen?"
<P>
"You have seen an old gentleman in want of his lunch."
<P>
"I have seen an old gentleman with something on his mind. What is
it?"
<P>
"Suppressed gout, my dear."
<P>
"That won't do! I am not to be put off in that way. Uncle! I want
to know--"
<P>
"Stop there, Blanche! A young lady who says she 'wants to know,'
expresses very dangerous sentiments. Eve 'wanted to know'--and
see what it led to. Faust 'wanted to know'--and got into bad
company, as the necessary result."
<P>
"You are feeling anxious about something," persisted Blanche.
"And, what is more, Sir Patrick, you behaved in a most
unaccountable manner a little while since."
<P>
"When?"
<P>
"When you went and hid yourself with Mr. Delamayn in that snug
corner there. I saw you lead the way in, while I was at work on
Lady Lundie's odious dinner-invitations."
<P>
"Oh! you call that being at work, do you? I wonder whether there
was ever a woman yet who could give the whole of her mind to any
earthly thing that she had to do?"
<P>
"Never mind the women! What subject in common could you and Mr.
Delamayn possibly have to talk about? And why do I see a wrinkle
between your eyebrows, now you have done with him?--a wrinkle
which certainly wasn't there before you had that private
conference together?"
<P>
Before answering, Sir Patrick considered whether he should take
Blanche into his confidence or not. The attempt to identify
Geoffrey's unnamed "lady," which he was determined to make, would
lead him to Craig Fernie, and would no doubt end in obliging him
to address himself to Anne. Blanche's intimate knowledge of her
friend might unquestionably be made useful to him under these
circumstances; and Blanche's discretion was to be trusted in any
matter in which Miss Silvester's interests were concerned. On the
other hand, caution was imperatively necessary, in the present
imperfect state of his information--and caution, in Sir Patrick's
mind, carried the day. He decided to wait and see what came first
of his investigation at the inn.
<P>
"Mr. Delamayn consulted me on a dry point of law, in which a
friend of his was interested," said Sir Patrick. "You have wasted
your curiosity, my dear, on a subject totally unworthy of a
lady's notice."
<P>
Blanche's penetration was not to be deceived on such easy terms
as these. "Why not say at once that you won't tell me?" she
rejoined. "_You_ shutting yourself up with Mr. Delamayn to talk
law! _You_ looking absent and anxious about it afterward! I am a
very unhappy girl!" said Blanche, with a little, bitter sigh.
"There is something in me that seems to repel the people I love.
Not a word in confidence can I get from Anne. And not a word in
confidence can I get from you. And I do so long to sympathize!
It's very hard. I think I shall go to Arnold."
<P>
Sir Patrick took his niece's hand.
<P>
"Stop a minute, Blanche. About Miss Silvester? Have you heard
from her to-day?"
<P>
"No. I am more unhappy about her than words can say."
<P>
"Suppose somebody went to Craig Fernie and tried to find out the
cause of Miss Silvester's silence? Would you believe that
somebody sympathized with you then?"
<P>
Blanche's face flushed brightly with pleasure and surprise. She
raised Sir Patrick's hand gratefully to her lips.
<P>
"Oh!" she exclaimed. "You don't mean that _you_ would do that?"
<P>
"I am certainly the last person who ought to do it--seeing that
you went to the inn in flat rebellion against my orders, and that
I only forgave you, on your own promise of amendment, the other
day. It is a miserably weak proceeding on the part of 'the head
of the family' to be turning his back on his own principles,
because his niece happens to be anxious and unhappy. Still (if
you could lend me your little carriage), I _might_ take a surly
drive toward Craig Fernie, all by myself, and I _might_ stumble
against Miss Silvester--in case you have any thing to say."
<P>
"Any thing to say?" repeated Blanche. She put her arm round her
uncle's neck, and whispered in his ear one of the most
interminable messages that ever was sent from one human being to
another. Sir Patrick listened, with a growing interest in the
inquiry on which he was secretly bent. "The woman must have some
noble qualities," he thought, "who can inspire such devotion as
this."
<P>
While Blanche was whispering to her uncle, a second private
conference--of the purely domestic sort--was taking place between
Lady Lundie and the butler, in the hall outside the library door.
<P>
"I am sorry to say, my lady, Hester Dethridge has broken out
again."
<P>
"What do you mean?"
<P>
"She was all right, my lady, when she went into the
kitchen-garden, some time since. She's taken strange again, now
she has come back. Wants the rest of the day to herself, your
ladyship. Says she's overworked, with all the company in the
house--and, I must say, does look like a person troubled and worn
out in body and mind."
<P>
"Don't talk nonsense, Roberts! The woman is obstinate and idle
and insolent. She is now in the house, as you know, under a
month's notice to leave. If she doesn't choose to do her duty for
that month I shall refuse to give her a character. Who is to cook
the dinner to-day if I give Hester Dethridge leave to go out?"
<P>
"Any way, my lady, I am afraid the kitchen-maid will have to do
her best to-day. Hester is very obstinate, when the fit takes
her--as your ladyship says."
<P>
"If Hester Dethridge leaves the kitchen-maid to cook the dinner,
Roberts, Hester Dethridge leaves my service to-day. I want no
more words about it. If she persists in setting my orders at
defiance, let her bring her account-book into the library, while
we are at lunch, and lay it out my desk. I shall be back in the
library after luncheon--and if I see the account-book I shall
know what it means. In that case, you will receive my directions
to settle with her and send her away. Ring the luncheon-bell."
<P>
The luncheon-bell rang. The guests all took the direction  of the
dining -room; Sir Patrick following, from the far end of the
library, with Blanche on his arm. Arrived at the dining-room
door, Blanche stopped, and asked her uncle to excuse her if she
left him to go in by himself.
<P>
"I will be back directly," she said. "I have forgotten something
up stairs."
<P>
Sir Patrick went in. The dining-room door closed; and Blanche
returned alone to the library. Now on one pretense, and now on
another, she had, for three days past, faithfully fulfilled the
engagement she had made at Craig Fernie to wait ten minutes after
luncheon-time in the library, on the chance of seeing Anne. On
this, the fourth occasion, the faithful girl sat down alone in
the great room, and waited with her eyes fixed on the lawn
outside.
<P>
Five minutes passed, and nothing living appeared but the birds
hopping about the grass.
<P>
In less than a minute more Blanche's quick ear caught the faint
sound of a woman's dress brushing over the lawn. She ran to the
nearest window, looked out, and clapped her hands with a cry of
delight. There was the well-known figure, rapidly approaching
her! Anne was true to their friendship--Anne had kept her
engagement at last!
<P>
Blanche hurried out, and drew her into the library in triumph.
"This makes amends, love for every thing! You answer my letter in
the best of all ways--you bring me your own dear self."
<P>
She placed Anne in a chair, and, lifting her veil, saw her
plainly in the brilliant mid-day light.
<P>
The change in the whole woman was nothing less than dreadful to
the loving eyes that rested on her. She looked years older than
her real age. There was a dull calm in her face, a stagnant,
stupefied submission to any thing, pitiable to see. Three days
and nights of solitude and grief, three days and nights of
unresting and unpartaken suspense, had crushed that sensitive
nature, had frozen that warm heart. The animating spirit was
gone--the mere shell of the woman lived and moved, a mockery of
her former self.
<P>
"Oh, Anne! Anne! What _can_ have happened to you? Are you
frightened? There's not the least fear of any body disturbing us.
They are all at luncheon, and the servants are at dinner. We have
the room entirely to ourselves. My darling! you look so faint and
strange! Let me get you something."
<P>
Anne drew Blanche's head down and kissed her. It was done in a
dull, slow way--without a word, without a tear, without a sigh.
<P>
"You're tired--I'm sure you're tired. Have you walked here? You
sha'n't go back on foot; I'll take care of that!"
<P>
Anne roused herself at those words. She spoke for the first time.
The tone was lower than was natural to her; sadder than was
natural to her--but the charm of her voice, the native gentleness
and beauty of it, seemed to have survived the wreck of all
besides.
<P>
"I don't go back, Blanche. I have left the inn."
<P>
"Left the inn? With your husband?"
<P>
She answered the first question--not the second.
<P>
"I can't go back," she said. "The inn is no place for me. A curse
seems to follow me, Blanche, wherever I go. I am the cause of
quarreling and wretchedness, without meaning it, God knows. The
old man who is head-waiter at the inn has been kind to me, my
dear, in his way, and he and the landlady had hard words together
about it. A quarrel, a shocking, violent quarrel. He has lost his
place in consequence. The woman, his mistress, lays all the blame
of it to my door. She is a hard woman; and she has been harder
than ever since Bishopriggs went away. I have missed a letter at
the inn--I must have thrown it aside, I suppose, and forgotten
it. I only know that I remembered about it, and couldn't find it
last night. I told the landlady, and she fastened a quarrel on me
almost before the words were out of my mouth. Asked me if I
charged her with stealing my letter. Said things to me--I can't
repeat them. I am not very well, and not able to deal with people
of that sort. I thought it best to leave Craig Fernie this
morning. I hope and pray I shall never see Craig Fernie again."
<P>
She told her little story with a total absence of emotion of any
sort, and laid her head back wearily on the chair when it was
done.
<P>
Blanche's eyes filled with tears at the sight of her.
<P>
"I won't tease you with questions, Anne," she said, gently. "Come
up stairs and rest in my room. You're not fit to travel, love.
I'll take care that nobody comes near us."
<P>
The stable-clock at Windygates struck the quarter to two. Anne
raised herself in the chair with a start.
<P>
"What time was that?" she asked.
<P>
Blanche told her.
<P>
"I can't stay," she said. "I have come here to find something out
if I can. You won't ask me questions? Don't, Blanche, don't! for
the sake of old times."
<P>
Blanche turned aside, heart-sick. "I will do nothing, dear, to
annoy you," she said, and took Anne's hand, and hid the tears
that were beginning to fall over her cheeks.
<P>
"I want to know something, Blanche. Will you tell me?"
<P>
"Yes. What is it?"
<P>
"Who are the gentlemen staying in the house?"
<P>
Blanche looked round at her again, in sudden astonishment and
alarm. A vague fear seized her that Anne's mind had given way
under the heavy weight of trouble laid on it. Anne persisted in
pressing her strange request.
<P>
"Run over their names, Blanche. I have a reason for wishing to
know who the gentlemen are who are staying in the house."
<P>
Blanche repeated the names of Lady Lundie's guests, leaving to
the last the guests who had arrived last.
<P>
"Two more came back this morning," she went on. "Arnold
Brinkworth and that hateful friend of his, Mr. Delamayn."
<P>
Anne's head sank back once more on the chair. She had found her
way without exciting suspicion of the truth, to the one discovery
which she had come to Windygates to make. He was in Scotland
again, and he had only arrived from London that morning. There
was barely time for him to have communicated with Craig Fernie
before she left the inn--he, too, who hated letter-writing! The
circumstances were all in his favor: there was no reason, there
was really and truly no reason, so far, to believe that he had
deserted her. The heart of the unhappy woman bounded in her
bosom, under the first ray of hope that had warmed it for four
days past. Under that sudden revulsion of feeling, her weakened
frame shook from head to foot. Her face flushed deep for a
moment--then turned deadly pale again. Blanche, anxiously
watching her, saw the serious necessity for giving some
restorative to her instantly.
<P>
"I am going to get you some wine--you will faint, Anne, if you
don't take something. I shall be back in a moment; and I can
manage it without any body being the wiser."
<P>
She pushed Anne's chair close to the nearest open window--a
window at the upper end of the library--and ran out.
<P>
Blanche had barely left the room, by the door that led into the,
hall, when Geoffrey entered it by one of the lower windows
opening from the lawn.
<P>
With his mind absorbed in the letter that he was about to write,
he slowly advanced up the room toward the nearest table. Anne,
hearing the sound of footsteps, started, and looked round. Her
failing strength rallied in an instant, under the sudden relief
of seeing him again. She rose and advanced eagerly, with a faint
tinge of color in her cheeks. He looked up. The two stood face to
face together--alone.
<P>
"Geoffrey!"
<P>
He looked at her without answering--without advancing a step, on
his side. There was an evil light in his eyes; his silence was
the brute silence that threatens dumbly. He had made up his mind
never to see her again, and she had entrapped him into an
interview. He had made up his mind to write, and there she stood
forcing him to speak. The sum of her offenses against him was now
complete. If there had ever been the faintest hope of her raising
even a passing pity in his heart, that hope would have been
annihilated now.
<P>
She failed to understand the full meaning of his silence. She
made her excuses, poor soul, for venturing back to
Windygates--her excuses to the man whose purpose at that moment
was to throw her helpless on the world.
<P>
"Pray forgive me for coming here," she said. "I have done nothing
to compromise you, Geoffrey. Nobody but Blanche knows I am at
Windygates. And I have contrived to make my inquiri es about you
without allowing her to suspect our secret." She stopped, and
began to tremble. She saw something more in his face than she had
read in it at first. "I got your letter," she went on, rallying
her sinking courage. "I don't complain of its being so short: you
don't like letter-writing, I know. But you promised I should hear
from you again. And I have never heard. And oh, Geoffrey, it was
so lonely at the inn!"
<P>
She stopped again, and supported herself by resting her hand on
the table. The faintness was stealing back on her. She tried to
go on again. It was useless--she could only look at him now.
<P>
"What do you want?" he asked, in the tone of a man who was
putting an unimportant question to a total stranger.
<P>
A last gleam of her old energy flickered up in her face, like a
dying flame.
<P>
"I am broken by what I have gone through," she said. "Don't
insult me by making me remind you of your promise."
<P>
"What promise?"'
<P>
"For shame, Geoffrey! for shame! Your promise to marry me."
<P>
"You claim my promise after what you have done at the inn?"
<P>
She steadied herself against the table with one hand, and put the
other hand to her head. Her brain was giddy. The effort to think
was too much for her. She said to herself, vacantly, "The inn?
What did I do at the inn?"
<P>
"I have had a lawyer's advice, mind! I know what I am talking
about."
<P>
She appeared not to have heard him. She repeated the words, "What
did I do at the inn?" and gave it up in despair. Holding by the
table, she came close to him and laid her hand on his arm.
<P>
"Do you refuse to marry me?" she asked.
<P>
He saw the vile opportunity, and said the vile words.
<P>
"You're married already to Arnold Brinkworth."
<P>
Without a cry to warn him, without an effort to save herself, she
dropped senseless at his feet; as her mother had dropped at his
father's feet in the by-gone time.
<P>
He disentangled himself from the folds of her dress. "Done!" he
said, looking down at her as she lay on the floor.
<P>
As the word fell from his lips he was startled by a sound in the
inner part of the house. One of the library doors had not been
completely closed. Light footsteps were audible, advancing
rapidly across the hall.
<P>
He turned and fled, leaving the library, as he had entered it, by
the open window at the lower end of the room.
