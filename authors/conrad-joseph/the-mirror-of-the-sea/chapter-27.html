<p> Heralded by the increasing fierceness of the squalls, sometimes
by a faint flash of lightning like the signal of a lighted torch
waved far away behind the clouds, the shift of wind comes at last,
the crucial moment of the change from the brooding and veiled
violence of the south-west gale to the sparkling, flashing, cutting,
clear-eyed anger of the King’s north-westerly mood.  You behold
another phase of his passion, a fury bejewelled with stars, mayhap
bearing the crescent of the moon on its brow, shaking the last
vestiges of its torn cloud-mantle in inky-black squalls, with
hail and sleet descending like showers of crystals and pearls,
bounding off the spars, drumming on the sails, pattering on the
oilskin coats, whitening the decks of homeward-bound ships.  Faint,
ruddy flashes of lightning flicker in the starlight upon her mastheads. 
A chilly blast hums in the taut rigging, causing the ship to tremble
to her very keel, and the soaked men on her decks to shiver in
their wet clothes to the very marrow of their bones.  Before one
squall has flown over to sink in the eastern board, the edge of
another peeps up already above the western horizon, racing up
swift, shapeless, like a black bag full of frozen water ready
to burst over your devoted head. The temper of the ruler of the
ocean has changed.  Each gust of the clouded mood that seemed
warmed by the heat of a heart flaming with anger has its counterpart
in the chilly blasts that seem blown from a breast turned to ice
with a sudden revulsion of feeling.  Instead of blinding your
eyes and crushing your soul with a terrible apparatus of cloud
and mists and seas and rain, the King of the West turns his power
to contemptuous pelting of your back with icicles, to making your
weary eyes water as if in grief, and your worn-out carcass quake
pitifully.  But each mood of the great autocrat has its own greatness,
and each is hard to bear.  Only the north-west phase of that mighty
display is not demoralizing to the same extent, because between
the hail and sleet squalls of a north-westerly gale one can see
a long way ahead.</p>

<p>To see! to see!—this is the craving of the sailor, as of the
rest of blind humanity.  To have his path made clear for him is
the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and tempestuous
existence.  I have heard a reserved, silent man, with no nerves
to speak of, after three days of hard running in thick south-westerly
weather, burst out passionately: "I wish to God we could get sight
of something!"</p>

<p>We had just gone down below for a moment to commune in a battened-down
cabin, with a large white chart lying limp and damp upon a cold
and clammy table under the light of a smoky lamp.  Sprawling over
that seaman’s silent and trusted adviser, with one elbow upon
the coast of Africa and the other planted in the neighbourhood
of Cape Hatteras (it was a general track-chart of the North Atlantic),
my skipper lifted his rugged, hairy face, and glared at me in
a half-exasperated, half-appealing way.  We have seen no sun,
moon, or stars for something like seven days.  By the effect of
the West Wind’s wrath the celestial bodies had gone into hiding
for a week or more, and the last three days had seen the force
of a south-west gale grow from fresh, through strong, to heavy,
as the entries in my log-book could testify.  Then we separated,
he to go on deck again, in obedience to that mysterious call that
seems to sound for ever in a shipmaster’s ears, I to stagger into
my cabin with some vague notion of putting down the words "Very
heavy weather" in a log-book not quite written up-to-date.  But
I gave it up, and crawled into my bunk instead, boots and hat
on, all standing (it did not matter; everything was soaking wet,
a heavy sea having burst the poop skylights the night before),
to remain in a nightmarish state between waking and sleeping for
a couple of hours of so-called rest.</p>

<p>The south-westerly mood of the West Wind is an enemy of sleep,
and even of a recumbent position, in the responsible officers
of a ship.  After two hours of futile, light-headed, inconsequent
thinking upon all things under heaven in that dark, dank, wet
and devastated cabin, I arose suddenly and staggered up on deck. 
The autocrat of the North Atlantic was still oppressing his kingdom
and its outlying dependencies, even as far as the Bay of Biscay,
in the dismal secrecy of thick, very thick, weather.  The force
of the wind, though we were running before it at the rate of some
ten knots an hour, was so great that it drove me with a steady
push to the front of the poop, where my commander was holding
on.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" he addressed me in an interrogative
yell.</p>

<p>What I really thought was that we both had had just about enough
of it. The manner in which the great West Wind chooses at times
to administer his possessions does not commend itself to a person
of peaceful and law-abiding disposition, inclined to draw distinctions
between right and wrong in the face of natural forces, whose standard,
naturally, is that of might alone.  But, of course, I said nothing. 
For a man caught, as it were, between his skipper and the great
West Wind silence is the safest sort of diplomacy.  Moreover,
I knew my skipper.  He did not want to know what I thought.  Shipmasters
hanging on a breath before the thrones of the winds ruling the
seas have their psychology, whose workings are as important to
the ship and those on board of her as the changing moods of the
weather.  The man, as a matter of fact, under no circumstances,
ever cared a brass farthing for what I or anybody else in his
ship thought. He had had just about enough of it, I guessed, and
what he was at really was a process of fishing for a suggestion. 
It was the pride of his life that he had never wasted a chance,
no matter how boisterous, threatening, and dangerous, of a fair
wind.  Like men racing blindfold for a gap in a hedge, we were
finishing a splendidly quick passage from the Antipodes, with
a tremendous rush for the Channel in as thick a weather as any
I can remember, but his psychology did not permit him to bring
the ship to with a fair wind blowing—at least not on his own initiative. 
And yet he felt that very soon indeed something would have to
be done.  He wanted the suggestion to come from me, so that later
on, when the trouble was over, he could argue this point with
his own uncompromising spirit, laying the blame upon my shoulders. 
I must render him the justice that this sort of pride was his
only weakness.</p>

<p>But he got no suggestion from me.  I understood his psychology. 
Besides, I had my own stock of weaknesses at the time (it is a
different one now), and amongst them was the conceit of being
remarkably well up in the psychology of the Westerly weather. 
I believed—not to mince matters—that I had a genius for reading
the mind of the great ruler of high latitudes. I fancied I could
discern already the coming of a change in his royal mood.  And
all I said was:</p>

<p>"The weather’s bound to clear up with the shift of wind."</p>

<p>"Anybody knows that much!" he snapped at me, at the highest pitch
of his voice.</p>

<p>"I mean before dark!" I cried.</p>

<p>This was all the opening he ever got from me.  The eagerness
with which he seized upon it gave me the measure of the anxiety
he had been labouring under.</p>

<p>"Very well," he shouted, with an affectation of impatience, as
if giving way to long entreaties.  "All right.  If we don’t get
a shift by then we’ll take that foresail off her and put her head
under her wing for the night."</p>

<p>I was struck by the picturesque character of the phrase as applied
to a ship brought-to in order to ride out a gale with wave after
wave passing under her breast.  I could see her resting in the
tumult of the elements like a sea-bird sleeping in wild weather
upon the raging waters with its head tucked under its wing.  In
imaginative precision, in true feeling, this is one of the most
expressive sentences I have ever heard on human lips.  But as
to taking the foresail off that ship before we put her head under
her wing, I had my grave doubts.  They were justified.  That long
enduring piece of canvas was confiscated by the arbitrary decree
of the West Wind, to whom belong the lives of men and the contrivances
of their hands within the limits of his kingdom.  With the sound
of a faint explosion it vanished into the thick weather bodily,
leaving behind of its stout substance not so much as one solitary
strip big enough to be picked into a handful of lint for, say,
a wounded elephant.  Torn out of its bolt-ropes, it faded like
a whiff of smoke in the smoky drift of clouds shattered and torn
by the shift of wind.  For the shift of wind had come.  The unveiled,
low sun glared angrily from a chaotic sky upon a confused and
tremendous sea dashing itself upon a coast.  We recognised the
headland, and looked at each other in the silence of dumb wonder.
Without knowing it in the least, we had run up alongside the Isle
of Wight, and that tower, tinged a faint evening red in the salt
wind-haze, was the lighthouse on St. Catherine’s Point.</p>

<p>My skipper recovered first from his astonishment.  His bulging
eyes sank back gradually into their orbits.  His psychology, taking
it all round, was really very creditable for an average sailor. 
He had been spared the humiliation of laying his ship to with
a fair wind; and at once that man, of an open and truthful nature,
spoke up in perfect good faith, rubbing together his brown, hairy
hands—the hands of a master-craftsman upon the sea:</p>

<p>"Humph! that’s just about where I reckoned we had got to."</p>

<p>The transparency and ingenuousness, in a way, of that delusion,
the airy tone, the hint of already growing pride, were perfectly
delicious.  But, in truth, this was one of the greatest surprises
ever sprung by the clearing up mood of the West Wind upon one
of the most accomplished of his courtiers.</p>
