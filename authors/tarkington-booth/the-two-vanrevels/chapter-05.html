<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Miss Carewe was at her desk, writing to Sister Cecilia, whom
she most loved of all the world, when the bells startled her with
their sudden clangor. The quill dropped from her hand; she started
to her feet, wide-eyed, not understanding; while the whole town,
drowsing peacefully a moment ago, resounded immediately with a
loud confusion. She ran to the front door and looked out, her
heart beating wildly.</p>

<p>The western sky was touched with a soft rose-color, which quickly
became a warm glow, fluctuated, and, in the instant, shot up like
the coming of a full Aurora. Then through the broken foliage of
the treetops could be seen the orange curls of flames, three-quarters
of a mile away though they were.</p>

<p>People, calling loudly that "it was Carewe's warehouses," were
running down the street. From the stable, old Nelson, on her father's
best horse, came galloping, and seeing the white figure in the
doorway, cried out in a quavering voice, without checking his
steed.</p>

<p>"I goin' tell yo' pa, Miss Betty, he in de kentry on lan' bus'ness.
Go back in de house, Missy!"</p>

<p>The other servants, like ragged sketches in the night, flitted
by, with excited ejaculations, to join the runners, and Miss Betty
followed them across the dew-strewn turf in her night slippers,
but at the gate she stopped.</p>

<p>From up the street came the sound of a bell smaller than those
of the churches and courthouse, yet one that outdid all others
in the madness of its appeal to clear the way. It was borne along
by what seemed at first an indefinite black mass, but which&mdash;as
the Aurora grew keener, producing even here a faint, yellow twilight&mdash;resolved
itself into a mob of hoarsely-shouting men and boys, who were
running and tugging at ropes, which drew along three extraordinary
vehicles. They came rapidly down the street and passed Miss Betty
with a hubbub and din beyond all understanding; one line of men,
most of them in red shirts and oil-cloth helmets, at a dead run
with the hose-cart; a second line with the hand-engine; the third
dragging the ladder-wagon. One man was riding, a tall, straight
gentleman in evening clothes and without a hat, who stood precariously
in the hose-cart, calling in an annoyed tone through a brazen
trumpet. Miss Betty recognized him at once; it was he who caught
her kitten; and she thought that if she had been Fanchon Bareaud
she must have screamed a warning, for his balance appeared a thing
of mere luck, and, if he fell, he would be trampled under foot
and probably run over by the engine. But, happily (she remembered),
she was not Fanchon Bareaud!</p>

<p>Before, behind, and beside the Department, raced a throng of
boys, wild with the joy experienced by their species when property
is being handsomely destroyed; after them came panting women,
holding their sides and gasping with the effort to keep up with
the flying procession.</p>

<p>Miss Betty trembled, for she had never seen the like in her life;
she stood close to the hedge and let them go by; then she turned
in after them and ran like a fleet young deer. She was going to
the fire.</p>

<p>Over all the uproar could be heard the angry voice through the
trumpet, calling the turns of the streets to the men in the van,
upbraiding them and those of the other two companies impartially;
and few of his hearers denied the chief his right to express some
chagrin; since the Department (organized a half-year, hard-drilled,
and this its first fire worth the name) was late on account of
the refusal of the members to move until they had donned their
new uniforms; for the uniforms had arrived from Philadelphia two
months ago, and tonight offered the first opportunity to display
them in public.</p>

<p>"Hail Vanrevel!" panted Tappingham Marsh to Eugene Madrillon,
as the two, running in the van of the "Hose Company," splattered
through a mud-puddle. "You'd think he was Carewe's only son and
heir instead of his worst enemy. Hark to the man!"</p>

<p>"I'd let it burn, if I were he," returned the other.</p>

<p>"It was all Crailey's fault," said Tappingham, swinging an arm
free to wipe the spattered mud from his face. "He swore he wouldn't
budge without his uniform, and the rest only backed him up; that
was all. Crailey said Carewe could better afford to lose his shanties
than the overworked Department its first chance to look beautiful
and earnest. Tom asked him why he didn't send for a fiddle," Marsh
finished with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Carewe might afford to lose a little, even a warehouse or two,
if only out of what he's taken from Crailey and the rest of us,
these three years!"</p>

<p>"Taken from Vanrevel, you mean. Who doesn't know where Crailey's
&mdash;Here's Main Street; look out for the turn!"</p>

<p>They swung out of the thick shadows of Carewe Street into full
view of the fire, and their faces were illuminated as by sunrise.</p>

<p>The warehouses stood on the river-bank, at the foot of the street,
just south of the new "covered bridge." There were four of them,
huge, bare-sided buildings; the two nearer the bridge of brick,
the others of wood, and all of them rich with stores of every
kind of river-merchandise and costly freight: furniture that had
voyaged from New England down the long coast, across the Mexican
Gulf, through the flat Delta, and had made the winding journey
up the great river a thousand miles, and almost a thousand more,
following the greater and lesser tributaries; cloth from Connecticut
that had been sold in Philadelphia, then carried over mountains
and through forests by steam, by canal, by stage, and six-mule
freight-wagons, to Pittsburg, down the Ohio, and thence up to
Rouen on the packet; Tennessee cotton, on its way to Massachusetts
and Rhode Island spindles, lay there beside huge mounds of raw
wool from Illinois, ready to be fed to the Rouen mill; dates and
nuts from the Caribbean Sea; lemons from groves of the faraway
tropics; cigars from the Antilles; tobacco from Virginia and Kentucky;
most precious of all, the great granary of the farmers' wheat
from the level fields at home; and all the rich stores and the
houses that held them, as well as the wharves upon which they
had been landed, and the steamers that brought them up the Rouen
River, belonged to Robert Carewe.</p>

<p>That it was her father's property which was imperilled attested
to the justification of Miss Betty in running to a fire; and,
as she followed the crowd into Main Street, she felt a not unpleasant
proprietary interest in the spectacle. Very opposite sensations
animated the breast of the man with the trumpet, who was more
acutely conscious than any other that these were Robert Carewe's
possessions which were burning so handsomely. Nor was he the only
one among the firemen who ground his teeth over the folly of the
uniforms; for now they could plainly see the ruin being wrought,
the devastation threatened. The two upper stories of the southernmost
warehouse had swathed themselves in one great flame; the building
next on the north, also of frame, was smoking heavily; and there
was a wind from the southwest, which, continuing with the fire
unchecked, threatened the town itself. There was work for the
Volunteer Brigade that night.</p>

<p>They came down Main Street with a rush, the figure of their chief
swaying over them on his high perch, while their shouting was
drowned in the louder roar of greeting from the crowd, into which
they plunged as a diver into the water, swirls and eddies of people
marking the wake. A moment later a section of the roof of the
burning warehouse fell in, with a sonorous and reverberating crash.</p>

<p>The "Engine Company" ran the force-pump out to the end of one
of the lower wharves; two lines of pipe were attached; two rows
of men mounted the planks for the pumpers, and, at the word of
command, began the up-and-down of the hand-machine with admirable
vim. Nothing happened; the water did not come; something appeared
to be wrong with the mechanism. As everyone felt the crucial need
of haste, nothing could have been more natural than that all the
members of the "Engine Company"  should simultaneously endeavor
to repair the defect; therefore ensued upon the spot a species
of riot which put the engine out of its sphere of usefulness.</p>

<p>In the meantime, fifty or sixty men and boys who ran with the
machines, but who had no place in their operation, being the Bucket
Brigade, had formed a line and were throwing large pails of water
in the general direction of the southernmost warehouse, which
it was now impossible to save; while the gentlemen of the "Hook-and-Ladder
Company," abandoning their wagons, and armed with axes, heroically
assaulted the big door of the granary, the second building, whence
they were driven by the exasperated chief, who informed them that
the only way to save the wheat was to save the building. Crailey
Gray, one of the berated axemen, remained by the shattered door
after the others had gone, and, struck by a sudden thought, set
his hand upon the iron latch and opened the door by this simple
process. It was not locked. Crailey leaned against the casement
and laughed with his whole soul and body.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, by dint of shouting in men's ears when near them,
through the trumpet when distant, tearing axes from their hands,
imperiously gesticulating to subordinate commanders, and lingering
in no one spot for more than a second, Mr. Vanrevel reduced his
forces to a semblance of order in a remarkably short time, considering
the confusion into which they had fallen.</p>

<p>The space between the burning warehouse and that next it was
not more than fifty feet in width, but fifty feet so hot no one
took thought of entering there; an area as discomfiting in appearance
as it was beautiful with the thick rain of sparks and firebrands
that fell upon it. But the chief had decided that this space must
be occupied, and more: must be held, since it was the only point
of defence for the second warehouse. The roof of this building
would burn, which would mean the destruction of the warehouse,
unless it could be mounted, because the streams of water could
not play upon it from the ground, nor, from the ladders, do much
more than wet the projecting eaves. It was a gable roof, the eaves
twenty feet lower on the south side than on the north, where the
ladders could not hope to reach them. Vanrevel swung his line
of bucketeers round to throw water, not upon the flames, but upon
the ladder-men.</p>

<p>Miss Carewe stood in the crowd upon the opposite side of the
broad street. Even there her cheeks were uncomfortably hot, and
sometimes she had to brush a spark from her shoulder, though she
was too much excited to mind this. She was watching the beautiful
fiery furnace between the north wall of the burning warehouse
and the south wall of its neighbor, the fifty feet brilliant and
misty with vaporous rose-color, dotted with the myriad red stars,
her eyes shining with the reflection of their fierce beauty. She
saw how the vapors moved there, like men walking in fire, and
she was vaguely recalling Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, when,
over the silhouetted heads of the crowd before her, a long black
ladder rose, wobbled, tilted crazily, then lamely advanced and
ranged itself against the south wall of the second warehouse,
its top rung striking ten feet short of the eaves. She hoped that
no one had any notion of mounting that ladder.</p>

<p>A figure appeared upon it immediately, that of a gentleman, bareheaded
and in evening dress, with a brass trumpet swinging from a cord
about his shoulders; the noise grew less; the shouting died away,
and the crowd became almost silent, as the figure, climbing slowly
drew up above their heads. Two or three rungs beneath, came a
second&mdash;a man in helmet and uniform. The clothes of both men,
drenched by the bucketeers, clung to them, steaming. As the second
figure mounted, a third appeared; but this was the last, for the
ladder was frail, and sagged toward the smoking wall with the
weight of the three.</p>

<p>The chief, three-fourths of the way to the top, shouted down
a stifled command, and a short grappling-ladder, fitted at one
end with a pair of spiked iron hooks, was passed to him. Then
he toiled upward until his feet rested on the third rung from
the top; here he turned, setting his back to the wall, lifted
the grappling-ladder high over his head so that it rested against
the eaves above him, and brought it down sharply, fastening the
spiked hooks in the roof. As the eaves projected fully three feet,
this left the grappling-ladder hanging that distance out from
the wall, its lowest rung a little above the level of the chief's
shoulders.</p>

<p>Miss Betty drew in her breath with a little choked cry. There
was a small terraced hill of piled-up packing-boxes near her,
possession of which had been taken by a company of raggamuffinish
boys, and she found herself standing on the highest box and sharing
the summit with these questionable youths, almost without noting
her action in mounting thither, so strained was the concentration
of her attention upon the figure high up in the rose-glow against
the warehouse wall. The man, surely, surely, was not going to
trust himself to that bit of wooden web hanging from the roof!
Where was Miss Bareaud that she permitted it? Ah, if Betty had
been Fanchon and madwoman enough to have accepted this madman,
she would have compelled him to come down at once, and thereafter
would lock him up in the house whenever the bells rang!</p>

<p>But the roof was to be mounted or Robert Carewe's property lost.
Already little flames were dancing up from the shingles, where
firebrands had fallen, their number increasing with each second.
So Vanrevel raised his arms, took a hard grip upon the lowest
rung of the grappling-ladder and tried it with his weight; the
iron hooks bit deeper into the roof; they held. He swung himself
out into the air with nothing beneath him, caught the rung under
his knee, and for a moment hung there while the crowd withheld
from breathing; then a cloud of smoke, swirling that way, made
him the mere ghostly nucleus of himself, blotted him out altogether,
and, as it rose slowly upward, showed the ladder free and empty,
so that at first there was an instant when they thought that he
had fallen. But, as the smoke cleared, there was the tall figure
on the roof.</p>

<p>It was an agile and daring thing to do, and the man who did it
was mightily applauded. The cheering bothered him, however, for
he was trying to make them understand, below, what would happen
to the "Engine Company" in case the water was not sent through
the lines directly; and what he said should be done to the engineers
included things that would have blanched the cheek of the most
inventive Spanish Inquisitor that ever lived.</p>

<p>Miss Betty made a gesture as if to a person within whispering
distance. "Your coat is on fire," she said in an ordinary conversational
tone, without knowing she had spoken aloud, and Mr. Vanrevel,
more than one hundred feet away, seemed particularly conscious
of the pertinence of her remark. He removed the garment with alacrity,
and, for the lack of the tardy water, began to use it as a flail
upon the firebrands and little flames about him; the sheer desperate
best of a man in a rage, doing what he could when others failed
him. Showers of sparks fell upon him; the smoke was rising everywhere
from the roof and the walls below; and, growing denser and denser,
shrouded him in heavy veils, so that, as he ran hither and thither,
now visible, now unseen, stamping and beating and sweeping away
the brands that fell, he seemed but the red and ghostly caricature
of a Xerxes, ineffectually lashing the sea. They were calling
to him imploringly to come down, in heaven's name to come down!</p>

<p>The second man had followed to the top of the ladder against
the wall, and there he paused, waiting to pass up the line of
hose when the word should come that the force-pump had been repaired;
but the people thought that he waited because he was afraid to
trust himself to the grappling-ladder. He was afraid, exceedingly
afraid; though that was not why he waited; and he was still chuckling
over the assault of the axes.</p>

<p>His situation had not much the advantage of that of the chief:
his red shirt might have been set with orange jewels, so studded
it was with the flying sparks; and, a large brand dropping upon
his helmet, he threw up his hand to dislodge it and lost the helmet.
The great light fell upon his fair hair and smiling face, and
it was then that Miss Betty recognized the Incroyable of her garden.</p>
