<p>Habakkuk McEwen entered upon his strange mission with ardor.
A few seconds carried him beyond sight of the fire, and he pushed
forward until fully two hundred yards distant, when he paused,
and listened.</p>

<p>He heard nothing of the Iroquois, who could not be far away.</p>

<p>"Over yonder lies the trail that leads to Stroudsburg," he said
to himself, "and this is the first fair start that I've had since
getting into this neighborhood. Such a promise as I made ain't
binding; the way Fred Godfrey has been going on, I think he's
able to take care of himself, and it's about time I did the same.
I'm off for Stroudsburg, and nothing short of an earthquake shall
stop me <em>this</em> time."</p>

<p>And thereupon he started like a frightened deer through the dark
woods, with the resolve that when the morrow's sun should rise
he would be many a mile to the eastward, and far beyond the reach
of Jake Golcher and his Senecas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Fred Godfrey, having done such good service for his
friend, was equally alert in making the most of it. He did not
forget that the sound of his rifle would direct the Senecas to
the spot whence it came, and should he remain five minutes in
the tree he would be at their mercy.</p>

<p>Consequently, the smoke had scarcely risen from the muzzle of
his weapon, and the death-shriek of bloody Black Turtle was yet
echoing on the air, when he came down as nimbly as a monkey and
hurried from the spot.</p>

<p>The shot that he had fired was one of those unexpected things
that startled the Senecas into temporary inaction, just enough
to serve a quick-witted person like Fred Godfrey.</p>

<p>He was loath to leave the vicinity of the camp, but self-preservation
commanded it, and he did not pause until a safe distance away.</p>

<p>His dread was that the Senecas would take revenge upon the whites
for the death of their comrade, and the youth meant to return
to a position that would enable him to interfere again, even though
the risk were tenfold greater than before.</p>

<p>But Fred had not listened more than a couple of minutes when
he was detected by an Indian, who must have followed him some
distance through the woods.</p>

<p>"Ugh! S'render&mdash;me kill!" growled the savage, bearing down upon
him with upraised tomahawk.</p>

<p>"Surrender, eh? That's the way I surrender!"</p>

<p>And, to the terror of the red man, he found the muzzle of a pistol
placed against his nose.</p>

<p>"Ugh! no shoot&mdash;me good Injun&mdash;ugh! Good Yengese!"</p>

<p>And the valiant fellow, ducking his head, and dodging from side
to side, like the Digger Indians of California, in the vain effort
to distract the aim of his enemy, went threshing through the wood
without any regard to noise or dignity.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Godfrey could have stopped his career without trouble,
merely by pressing the trigger; but he did not do so. He was a
civilized soldier.</p>

<p>"Go in peace," laughed Fred, putting his weapon away. "Heaven
knows I do not wish to take human life!"</p>

<p>As the youth had now reached a point where he could feel safe
from his pursuers, he proceeded to reload his rifle.</p>

<p>In the darkness it required care, and was a task compared to
which that of breech-loading of to-day is nothing. The few beams
of moonlight that had disclosed him and the Seneca to each other
helped him to pour out the powder from the horn around his waist,
and to adjust the quantity in the pan of his flintlock.</p>

<p>"If I continue this picking off of warriors, one at a time,"
muttered Fred, "I will be able to thin them out before morning."</p>

<p>He was reminded of the delicacy of his position, by hearing low
whistling on his right.</p>

<p>"Doubtless that is the one I drove away," was his reflection.
"He wants to call some of his brothers before I leave, so he can
reward me as an Indian likes to reward one who shows him mercy.
But, hello!"</p>

<p>Like a flash came the thought that the peculiar signals that
had been going on for some minutes were not those of an Indian,
but of his friend, Gravity Gimp.</p>

<p>"I do believe it is he, calling to me," said the lieutenant,
as he stationed himself in the shadow of a tree, and, holding
his weapon ready for use, cautiously answered the hail, which
sounded clear and distinct on the still summer night.</p>

<p>Instantly came the reply, and then he replied in turn, so that
communication was established, and whether the other was a friend
or foe, it became evident that he was approaching.</p>

<p>The lieutenant did not feel free from fear, for he was aware
of the subtlety of the foes against whom he was contending, and
nothing was more natural than that they should resort to such
a simple artifice to mislead him.</p>

<p>He therefore ceased answering the call when it came close, but
held himself ready to fire and withdraw the instant he should
detect the deception.</p>

<p>A figure was dimly seen in a small, moonlit space in front, advancing
upon him in a crouching posture. Fred fastened his eyes on the
shadowy outlines, and he grasped his gun with both hands.</p>

<p>Just then the half-bent man straightened up, and, with a relief
that was delightful, Fred recognized the form of Gravity Gimp,
who had been hunting and signaling so industriously for the last
fifteen minutes.</p>
