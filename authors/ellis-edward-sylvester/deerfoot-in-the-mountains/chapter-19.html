<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Mul-tal-la the Blackfoot obeyed the command of Taggarak, his
chief. But though he kept away from the meeting place of the duelists,
he hovered not far off, in order to learn at the earliest possible
moment the result of the most important personal encounter that
had ever taken place in the history of the Blackfoot nation. Because
of the circuitous course taken by George and Victor Shelton, Mul-tal-la
saw nothing of them and never learned of the humorous appendix
to the tragedy.</p>

<p>The sight of the Shawanoe returning told who was victor, and
a few brief words between the two, as they met, made known that
he had spared the life of the chief, who slunk silently off in
the solitude, no one but himself knew whither. It was this flight
that was on the mind of Deerfoot and Mul-tal-la, for each felt
that momentous consequences were to flow therefrom.</p>

<p>The four friends were once more gathered in the home of the guests
of the Blackfoot tribe. Each knew a crisis was at hand that might
compel them, on the edge of the severe northern winter, to depart
for other quarters, and the flight, perhaps, would become impossible
because of the ferocious rage of the humiliated chieftain.</p>

<p>The Shelton brothers acted the part of listeners, sensibly feeling
that they could contribute nothing to the discussion between Mul-tal-la
and Deerfoot; but no speakers could have asked for more deeply
interested auditors than they.</p>

<p>"Taggarak has not come back," said the Blackfoot. "Mul-tal-la
stopped at his lodge, and his squaw said she had seen naught of
him since this morning."</p>

<p>"She does not know what took place?" was the inquiring remark
of Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"She could not, for he kept his word and told no one before,
and," grimly added the Blackfoot, "he would not tell anyone afterward."</p>

<p>"What does she think?"</p>

<p>"That he has gone to one of the other villages. Taggarak is a
silent man, and he sometimes departs in the middle of the night,
without saying a word to anyone. He may be gone for weeks, and
no one here will know anything of it until he returns."</p>

<p>"What does Mul-tal-la think?"</p>

<p>"He knows not what to think. If Taggarak is not here to-morrow,
then he will believe the chief is visiting his other warriors."</p>

<p>"Does he not summon his other chiefs to come to him?"</p>

<p>"Often; they meet at the Big Lodge. They talk together, when
they are making ready to go on raids among other tribes, and Taggarak
gives them his commands; but he likes to appear in their villages
when they do not look for his coming. What does my brother believe
the chief will do when he comes back?"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe waited for a minute or two before replying:</p>

<p>"There is a mist in the eyes of Deerfoot and he cannot see clearly.
Taggarak is brave but cruel. He will not rest under his overthrow.
Deerfoot thinks they will have to fight again."</p>

<p>"And will Deerfoot spare him once more?"</p>

<p>"He cannot answer. He will do as God tells him to do."</p>

<p>Victor Shelton felt that this was a good time for him to add
to the discussion.</p>

<p>"Mul-tal-la, do you think it is possible Taggarak wants to fight
Deerfoot, after he has been beaten by him? Why should he want
to try it again?"</p>

<p>"Because he has hope of winning the fight."</p>

<p>"He can't have any such hope. Why, Deerfoot whipped him without
a weapon in his hand, while Taggarak had his big, ugly knife most
of the time."</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la had not heard anything of this, and he looked inquiringly
at Deerfoot and then at the boy who had made the amazing statement.
Victor flushed and stammeringly added:</p>

<p>"That is&mdash;it would have been easy for Deerfoot to whip him without
any weapon and with one hand tied behind his back&mdash;that is, it
looks so to me and George&mdash;and I'm sure he could do it if he wished&mdash;confound
it, Deerfoot, <em>didn't</em> you whip him as I said?"</p>

<p>The visitor turned to the Shawanoe, who gravely nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot has told me things from the good book which he carries
with him, and he said there was One who used to do some things
so strange that they were called miracles."</p>

<p>"Yes, He did many of them."</p>

<p>"Then Deerfoot did a miracle if he overthrew Taggarak without
the help of any weapon."</p>

<p>"No," modestly replied the Shawanoe, "there was no miracle. It
was easier to defeat him without a weapon than with one. Deerfoot
wrenched the knife from his hand and then threw him to the ground;
that was all."</p>

<p>"That was all!" repeated the Blackfoot, as if to himself. Then
he looked at the boys and the three laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was all. George or I could have done the same, but
we thought it better to turn the job over to Deerfoot. He's fond
of doing such trifles," said Victor, airily.</p>

<p>The result of the conference was the decision that naught could
be done except to await the issue of events. All feared the worst,
and strove to prepare for it. The belief was that the rage in
the breast of Chief Taggarak would lead him to merciless measures,
not only against his visitors, but against all of his own people
who had showed an inclination to embrace the new religion.</p>

<p>Three days passed and nothing was heard of the chief. He was
still absent, and the general belief of his people that he was
among the other villages averted misgiving. Only those in the
secret were in dread. But the seed planted by Deerfoot began to
bear fruit. Inquiries came to him, and the excitement over the
religion he brought, even though subdued, spread among the warriors
and women of the tribe. Finally Mul-tal-la came to him with the
surprising request that he would address the Indians in the Big
Lodge on the all-important subject. In making the request, Mul-tal-la
the Blackfoot spoke for others. Without hesitation the Shawanoe
replied that he would do as desired. He felt it was his duty,
and he was the last one to shrink.</p>

<p>Near the middle of the primitive settlement was a structure known
as the "Big Lodge." It was of the simplest build, being some forty
feet in length by about half that width. It consisted of upright
poles at the corners, with other supports along the sides, and
a roof of boughs similar to that of the royal lodge. All the sides
were open; there were no seats and no provisions for fire. Consequently
the temperature was always the same as that outdoors.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the Blackfeet to hold their councils in
this place, Taggarak being fond of summoning his chiefs and leading
warriors thither, while they smoked their pipes and settled questions
of state. Most of the time the barren structure was deserted.</p>

<p>On a bleak afternoon late in autumn, when a few inches of snow
lay on the ground and the wind moaned among the leafless branches,
Deerfoot the Shawanoe and the Shelton brothers wended their way
to the Big Lodge. The boys paused at the edge of the assemblage
and silently took their place among the listeners. They, as well
as their friend, were astonished to see the crowd that had gathered.
Warriors and women, with here and there a child, were seated everywhere
on the bare ground, till it was hard to find room for another
person. No one could fail to be impressed by the air of solemnity
that shadowed each dusky face. Nearly every male and female sat
with a shawl wrapped around the shoulders, for the air was biting,
and no one had any protection from it except clothing. Victor
whispered to his brother:</p>

<p>"I never expected to see anything like this. Who would have thought
that the few words Deerfoot has spoken about our religion could
have stirred up such deep feeling?"</p>

<p>An Indian scorns to betray curiosity or excitement, and only
a few of the warriors and squaws looked up as the young Shawanoe
picked his way through and among the multitude, who numbered several
hundred, to the farther end of the space, where he turned to face
the expectant listeners. He had left his rifle at the tepee, but
his knife was in his girdle. To those who had slight knowledge
of him he looked his simple, natural self; but George and Victor,
when they scanned their friend observed a deeper flush in his
face and a brighter gleam in the eyes, which revealed to them
the profound emotion that stirred his soul.</p>

<p>Deerfoot stood for a minute, looking over the swarthy faces turned
expectantly toward him. He had prayed many times for strength
to meet this ordeal, and he knew he would do so.</p>

<p>Then he began speaking in his low, musical voice, which was clearly
heard by those farthest removed. He used the Blackfoot tongue,
so that only a part of his words were understood by George and
Victor, and never halted or hesitated until the interruption came.</p>

<p>"My friends," said he, "the heart of Deerfoot is glad to tell
you about the Great Spirit who is the Father of the red men as
well as of the palefaces. Many, many moons ago that Father made
this world; the sun that shines by day and the moon and stars
that rule at night; the mountains, the woods, the rivers, the
prairies, the rocks, the clouds and all that you see about you.
He gave His children game to hunt, and He caused the fish to grow
in the streams and the corn and fruit to spring from the ground.
There was nothing that His children needed that He did not give
to them.</p>

<p>"Was not that Father kind? Could any father be as good to his
children as God was to those He put on the earth to live together?
Should not those children love Him and try to live as He wished
them to live? But they were wicked and did not care for Him. They
fought and killed one another and did all they could to offend
their Heavenly Father. They were so bad that bye and bye He turned
away His face in anger. He would have slain them as they deserved,
but He had a Son, good and pure like Himself. This Son took the
load of all the sins of the world on his heart. He came to the
earth and told the people how sad God was because they did evil.
Some heeded His words, but bad men took the Son, whom we call
our Saviour, because He saved us all&mdash;you and me and everybody&mdash;and
they drove nails through his hands and feet, and let Him hang
on two crosspieces of wood till He died the most painful of deaths.
He could have killed those who treated Him so cruelly, but He
chose to die so that the way would be opened for all men and women
and children to come to God, who was angry no longer, because
the Son had taken their place and suffered in their stead.</p>

<p>"The Great Spirit, whom we call God or our Heavenly Father, has
made the path so straight and so free from briars that the smallest
child can walk therein without harm. He wants you to become Christians
and to believe in Him. A Christian is one who does all he can
to make others happy. You must not go to war, and only fight when
others attack you or those whom you love. You must be merciful
and forgiving. Never cause anyone to suffer. Give food to the
hungry, help those who have fallen to climb to their feet, take
them by the hand and lead them if they are weak. Think all the
time of new ways of making other persons smile. You must pray
to God every morning and night and, when you have the chance,
through the day. If you do this, a sweet peace, such as you have
never known before, will come into your heart. You will not care
for pain or hunger or thirst or suffering, for the happiness of
pleasing your Heavenly Father will make you forget all these.
When you die He will carry you to those blessed hunting grounds,
where you shall meet all the friends who have gone on before and
where you and they shall be happy forevermore."</p>

<p>During the utterance of this simple plea the Big Lodge was as
still as the tomb. It is safe to believe that not a man or woman
present failed to be impressed, for every person, savage or civilized,
pagan or Christian, is profoundly interested in the most transcendant
theme that can engage the human mind&mdash;the saving of man's soul
and the preparation for the life to come. None other can compare
with it. It is the one supreme question of the ages.</p>

<p>Those who looked at Deerfoot thought he had finished his address,
but it was not so. George and Victor Shelton were the first to
understand from his manner that something outside of the lodge
had checked him. He was looking beyond the boys at some object
that had made him cease speaking. The boys turned their heads
to learn the meaning of the interruption. As they did so they
heard some one approaching with a rapid step.</p>

<p>It was Taggarak, the chief, his face aflame, his stride long
and rapid and his intense gaze centered on the young Shawanoe.
Paying no heed to those in his way, he brushed past, overturning
several and plowed straight through the crowd toward Deerfoot,
who calmly awaited his coming.</p>

<p>Every eye was fixed upon the terrible chieftain, and hardly one
of his people doubted that he meant to assail the Shawanoe. The
hearts of George and Victor Shelton stood still, for they felt
that a tragedy was about to open.</p>

<p>Instead of drawing his knife, Deerfoot placed both hands behind
his back, after the idle manner of one who feels little interest
in what is going on before him.</p>

<p>Within a couple of paces of Deerfoot, Taggarak wheeled around,
and, in a voice of thunder addressed his people:</p>

<p>"The Shawanoe speaks with a single tongue! His words are true!
The Great Spirit he tells you about is the true and only Great
Spirit! Taggarak did not think so; he scorned him, but his eyes
have been opened and he now sees. He has been wandering in the
woods for days and nights, trying to flee from the anger of that
Great Spirit. His eyes were filled with tears; he lay on his face
and cried to Him; he did not eat nor drink nor sleep; but the
Great Spirit, the true Great Spirit, spoke loving words to Taggarak.
He raised him to his feet; He showed him that all the briars had
been taken from his path. Taggarak looked around and all the darkness
was gone and the sun was shining in the sky. The Great Spirit
was pleased. He told Taggarak he was now His son and all shall
be well with him.</p>

<p>"Heed the words of the Shawanoe, for they are true. Taggarak
is a Christian and wishes all the Blackfeet to become Christians."</p>
