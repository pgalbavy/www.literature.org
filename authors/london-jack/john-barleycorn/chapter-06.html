But the time was rapidly drawing near when I was to begin my
second series of bouts with John Barleycorn.  When I was fourteen,
my head filled with the tales of the old voyagers, my vision with
tropic isles and far sea-rims, I was sailing a small centreboard
skiff around San Francisco Bay and on the Oakland Estuary.  I
wanted to go to sea.  I wanted to get away from monotony and the
commonplace.  I was in the flower of my adolescence, a-thrill with
romance and adventure, dreaming of wild life in the wild man-
world.  Little I guessed how all the warp and woof of that man-
world was entangled with alcohol.
<P>
So, one day, as I hoisted sail on my skiff, I met Scotty.  He was
a husky youngster of seventeen, a runaway apprentice, he told me,
from an English ship in Australia.  He had just worked his way on
another ship to San Francisco; and now he wanted to see about
getting a berth on a whaler.  Across the estuary, near where the
whalers lay, was lying the sloop-yacht Idler.  The caretaker was a
harpooner who intended sailing next voyage on the whale ship
Bonanza.  Would I take him, Scotty, over in my skiff to call upon
the harpooner?
<P>
Would I! Hadn't I heard the stories and rumours about the Idler?--
the big sloop that had come up from the Sandwich Islands where it
had been engaged in smuggling opium.  And the harpooner who was
caretaker! How often had I seen him and envied him his freedom. 
He never had to leave the water.  He slept aboard the Idler each
night, while I had to go home upon the land to go to bed.  The
harpooner was only nineteen years old (and I have never had
anything but his own word that he was a harpooner); but he had
been too shining and glorious a personality for me ever to address
as I paddled around the yacht at a wistful distance.  Would I take
Scotty, the runaway sailor, to visit the harpooner, on the opium-
smuggler Idler?  WOULD I!
<P>
The harpooner came on deck to answer our hail, and invited us
aboard.  I played the sailor and the man, fending off the skiff so
that it would not mar the yacht's white paint, dropping the skiff
astern on a long painter, and making the painter fast with two
nonchalant half-hitches.
<P>
We went below.  It was the first sea-interior I had ever seen. 
The clothing on the wall smelled musty.  But what of that? Was it
not the sea-gear of men?--leather jackets lined with corduroy,
blue coats of pilot cloth, sou'westers, sea-boots, oilskins.  And
everywhere was in evidence the economy of space--the narrow bunks,
the swinging tables, the incredible lockers.  There were the tell-
tale compass, the sea-lamps in their gimbals, the blue-backed
charts carelessly rolled and tucked away, the signal-flags in
alphabetical order, and a mariner's dividers jammed into the
woodwork to hold a calendar.  At last I was living.  Here I sat,
inside my first ship, a smuggler, accepted as a comrade by a
harpooner and a runaway English sailor who said his name was
Scotty.
<P>
The first thing that the harpooner, aged nineteen, and the sailor,
aged seventeen, did to show that they were men was to behave like
men.  The harpooner suggested the eminent desirableness of a
drink, and Scotty searched his pockets for dimes and nickels. 
Then the harpooner carried away a pink flask to be filled in some
blind pig, for there were no licensed saloons in that locality. 
We drank the cheap rotgut out of tumblers.  Was I any the less
strong, any the less valiant, than the harpooner and the sailor? 
They were men.  They proved it by the way they drank.  Drink was
the badge of manhood.  So I drank with them, drink by drink, raw
and straight, though the damned stuff couldn't compare with a
stick of chewing taffy or a delectable "cannon-ball." I shuddered
and swallowed my gorge with every drink, though I manfully hid all
such symptoms.
<P>
Divers times we filled the flask that afternoon.  All I had was
twenty cents, but I put it up like a man, though with secret
regret at the enormous store of candy it could have bought.  The
liquor mounted in the heads of all of us, and the talk of Scotty
and the harpooner was upon running the Easting down, gales off the
Horn and pamperos off the Plate, lower topsail breezes, southerly
busters, North Pacific gales, and of smashed whaleboats in the
Arctic ice.
<P>
"You can't swim in that ice water," said the harpooner
confidentially to me.  "You double up in a minute and go down. 
When a whale smashes your boat, the thing to do is to get your
belly across an oar, so that when the cold doubles you you'll
float."
<P>
"Sure," I said, with a grateful nod and an air of certitude that
I, too, would hunt whales and be in smashed boats in the Arctic
Ocean.  And, truly, I registered his advice as singularly valuable
information, and filed it away in my brain, where it persists to
this day.
<P>
But I couldn't talk--at first.  Heavens! I was only fourteen, and
had never been on the ocean in my life.  I could only listen to
the two sea-dogs, and show my manhood by drinking with them,
fairly and squarely, drink and drink.
<P>
The liquor worked its will with me; the talk of Scotty and the
harpooner poured through the pent space of the Idler's cabin and
through my brain like great gusts of wide, free wind; and in
imagination I lived my years to come and rocked over the wild,
mad, glorious world on multitudinous adventures.
<P>
We unbent.  Our inhibitions and taciturnities vanished.  We were
as if we had known each other for years and years, and we pledged
ourselves to years of future voyagings together.  The harpooner
told of misadventures and secret shames.  Scotty wept over his
poor old mother in Edinburgh--a lady, he insisted, gently born--
who was in reduced circumstances, who had pinched herself to pay
the lump sum to the ship-owners for his apprenticeship, whose
sacrificing dream had been to see him a merchantman officer and a
gentleman, and who was heartbroken because he had deserted his
ship in Australia and joined another as a common sailor before the
mast.  And Scotty proved it.  He drew her last sad letter from his
pocket and wept over it as he read it aloud.  The harpooner and I
wept with him, and swore that all three of us would ship on the
whaleship Bonanza, win a big pay-day, and, still together, make a
pilgrimage to Edinburgh and lay our store of money in the dear
lady's lap.
<P>
And, as John Barleycorn heated his way into my brain, thawing my
reticence, melting my modesty, talking through me and with me and
as me, my adopted twin brother and alter ego, I, too, raised my
voice to show myself a man and an adventurer, and bragged in
detail and at length of how I had crossed San Francisco Bay in my
open skiff in a roaring southwester when even the schooner sailors
doubted my exploit.  Further, I--or John Barleycorn, for it was
the same thing--told Scotty that he might be a deep-sea sailor and
know the last rope on the great deep-sea ships, but that when it
came to small-boat sailing I could beat him hands down and sail
circles around him.
<P>
The best of it was that my assertion and brag were true.  With
reticence and modesty present, I could never have dared tell
Scotty my small-boat estimate of him.  But it is ever the way of
John Barleycorn to loosen the tongue and babble the secret
thought.
<P>
Scotty, or John Barleycorn, or the pair, was very naturally
offended by my remarks.  Nor was I loath.  I could whip any
runaway sailor seventeen years old.  Scotty and I flared and raged
like young cockerels, until the harpooner poured another round of
drinks to enable us to forgive and make up.  Which we did, arms
around each other's necks, protesting vows of eternal friendship--
just like Black Matt and Tom Morrisey, I remembered, in the ranch
kitchen in San Mateo.  And, remembering, I knew that I was at last
a man--despite my meagre fourteen years--a man as big and manly as
those two strapping giants who had quarrelled and made up on that
memorable Sunday morning of long ago.
<P>
By this time the singing stage was reached, and I joined Scotty
and the harpooner in snatches of sea songs and chanties.  It was
here, in the cabin of the Idler, that I first heard "Blow the Man
Down," "Flying Cloud," and "Whisky, Johnny, Whisky." Oh, it was
brave.  I was beginning to grasp the meaning of life.  Here was no
commonplace, no Oakland Estuary, no weary round of throwing
newspapers at front doors, delivering ice, and setting up
ninepins.  All the world was mine, all its paths were under my
feet, and John Barleycorn, tricking my fancy, enabled me to
anticipate the life of adventure for which I yearned.
<P>
We were not ordinary.  We were three tipsy young gods, incredibly
wise, gloriously genial, and without limit to our powers.  Ah!--
and I say it now, after the years--could John Barleycorn keep one
at such a height, I should never draw a sober breath again.  But
this is not a world of free freights.  One pays according to an
iron schedule--for every strength the balanced weakness; for every
high a corresponding low; for every fictitious god-like moment an
equivalent time in reptilian slime.  For every feat of telescoping
long days and weeks of life into mad magnificent instants, one
must pay with shortened life, and, oft-times, with savage usury
added.
<P>
Intenseness and duration are as ancient enemies as fire and water. 
They are mutually destructive.  They cannot co-exist.  And John
Barleycorn, mighty necromancer though he be, is as much a slave to
organic chemistry as we mortals are.  We pay for every nerve
marathon we run, nor can John Barleycorn intercede and fend off
the just payment.  He can lead us to the heights, but he cannot
keep us there, else would we all be devotees.  And there is no
devotee but pays for the mad dances John Barleycorn pipes.
<P>
Yet the foregoing is all in after wisdom spoken.  It was no part
of the knowledge of the lad, fourteen years old, who sat in the
Idler's cabin between the harpooner and the sailor, the air rich
in his nostrils with the musty smell of men's sea-gear, roaring in
chorus: "Yankee ship come down de ribber--pull, my bully boys,
pull!"
<P>
We grew maudlin, and all talked and shouted at once.  I had a
splendid constitution, a stomach that would digest scrap-iron, and
I was still running my marathon in full vigour when Scotty began
to fail and fade.  His talk grew incoherent.  He groped for words
and could not find them, while the ones he found his lips were
unable to form.  His poisoned consciousness was leaving him.  The
brightness went out of his eyes, and he looked as stupid as were
his efforts to talk.  His face and body sagged as his
consciousness sagged.  (A man cannot sit upright save by an act of
will.) Scotty's reeling brain could not control his muscles.  All
his correlations were breaking down.  He strove to take another
drink, and feebly dropped the tumbler on the floor.  Then, to my
amazement, weeping bitterly, he rolled into a bunk on his back and
immediately snored off to sleep.
<P>
The harpooner and I drank on, grinning in a superior way to each
other over Scotty's plight.  The last flask was opened, and we
drank it between us, to the accompaniment of Scotty's stertorous
breathing.  Then the harpooner faded away into his bunk, and I was
left alone, unthrown, on the field of battle.
<P>
I was very proud, and John Barleycorn was proud with me.  I could
carry my drink.  I was a man.  I had drunk two men, drink for
drink, into unconsciousness.  And I was still on my two feet,
upright, making my way on deck to get air into my scorching lungs. 
It was in this bout on the Idler that I discovered what a good
stomach and a strong head I had for drink--a bit of knowledge that
was to be a source of pride in succeeding years, and that
ultimately I was to come to consider a great affliction.  The
fortunate man is the one who cannot take more than a couple of
drinks without becoming intoxicated.  The unfortunate wight is the
one who can take many glasses without betraying a sign, who must
take numerous glasses in order to get the "kick."
<P>
The sun was setting when I came on the Idler's deck.  There were
plenty of bunks below.  I did not need to go home.  But I wanted
to demonstrate to myself how much I was a man.  There lay my skiff
astern.  The last of a strong ebb was running out in channel in
the teeth of an ocean breeze of forty miles an hour.  I could see
the stiff whitecaps, and the suck and run of the current was
plainly visible in the face and trough of each one.
<P>
I set sail, cast off, took my place at the tiller, the sheet in my
hand, and headed across channel.  The skiff heeled over and
plunged into it madly.  The spray began to fly.  I was at the
pinnacle of exaltation.  I sang "Blow the Man Down" as I sailed. 
I was no boy of fourteen, living the mediocre ways of the sleepy
town called Oakland.  I was a man, a god, and the very elements
rendered me allegiance as I bitted them to my will.
<P>
The tide was out.  A full hundred yards of soft mud intervened
between the boat-wharf and the water.  I pulled up my centreboard,
ran full tilt into the mud, took in sail, and, standing in the
stern, as I had often done at low tide, I began to shove the skiff
with an oar.  It was then that my correlations began to break
down.  I lost my balance and pitched head-foremost into the ooze. 
Then, and for the first time, as I floundered to my feet covered
with slime, the blood running down my arms from a scrape against a
barnacled stake, I knew that I was drunk.  But what of it? Across
the channel two strong sailormen lay unconscious in their bunks
where I had drunk them.  I WAS a man.  I was still on my legs, if
they were knee-deep in mud.  I disdained to get back into the
skiff.  I waded through the mud, shoving the skiff before me and
yammering the chant of my manhood to the world.
<P>
I paid for it.  I was sick for a couple of days, meanly sick, and
my arms were painfully poisoned from the barnacle scratches.  For
a week I could not use them, and it was a torture to put on and
take off my clothes.
<P>
I swore, "Never again!" The game wasn't worth it.  The price was
too stiff.  I had no moral qualms.  My revulsion was purely
physical.  No exalted moments were worth such hours of misery and
wretchedness.  When I got back to my skiff, I shunned the Idler. 
I would cross the opposite side of the channel to go around her. 
Scotty had disappeared.  The harpooner was still about, but him I
avoided.  Once, when he landed on the boat-wharf, I hid in a shed
so as to escape seeing him.  I was afraid he would propose some
more drinking, maybe have a flask full of whisky in his pocket.
<P>
And yet--and here enters the necromancy of John Barleycorn--that
afternoon's drunk on the Idler had been a purple passage flung
into the monotony of my days.  It was memorable.  My mind dwelt on
it continually.  I went over the details, over and over again. 
Among other things, I had got into the cogs and springs of men's
actions.  I had seen Scotty weep about his own worthlessness and
the sad case of his Edinburgh mother who was a lady.  The
harpooner had told me terribly wonderful things of himself.  I had
caught a myriad enticing and inflammatory hints of a world beyond
my world, and for which I was certainly as fitted as the two lads
who had drunk with me.  I had got behind men's souls.  I had got
behind my own soul and found unguessed potencies and greatnesses.
<P>
Yes, that day stood out above all my other days.  To this day it
so stands out.  The memory of it is branded in my brain.  But the
price exacted was too high.  I refused to play and pay, and
returned to my cannon-balls and taffy-slabs.  The point is that
all the chemistry of my healthy, normal body drove me away from
alcohol.  The stuff didn't agree with me.  It was abominable. 
But, despite this, circumstance was to continue to drive me toward
John Barleycorn, to drive me again and again, until, after long
years, the time should come when I would look up John Barleycorn
in every haunt of men--look him up and hail him gladly as
benefactor and friend.  And detest and hate him all the time. 
Yes, he is a strange friend, John Barleycorn.
