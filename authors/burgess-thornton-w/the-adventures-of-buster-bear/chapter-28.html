<p>Buster Bear is a great hand to talk to himself when he thinks
no one is around to overhear. It's a habit. However, it isn't
a bad habit unless it is carried too far. Any habit becomes bad,
if it is carried too far. Suppose you had a secret, a real secret,
something that nobody else knew and that you didn't want anybody
else to know. And suppose you had the habit of talking to yourself.
You might, without thinking, you know, tell that secret out loud
to yourself, and some one might, just might happen to overhear!
Then there wouldn't be any secret. That is the way that a habit
which isn't bad in itself can become bad when it is carried too
far.</p>

<p>Now Buster Bear had lived by himself in the Great Woods so long
that this habit of talking to himself had grown and grown. He
did it just to keep from being lonesome. Of course, when he came
down to the Green Forest to live, he brought all his habits with
him. That is one thing about habits,&mdash;you always take them with
you wherever you go. So Buster brought this habit of talking to
himself down to the Green Forest, where he had many more neighbors
than he had in the Great Woods.</p>

<p>"Let me see, let me see, what is there to tempt my appetite?"
said Buster in his deep, grumbly-rumbly voice. "I find my appetite
isn't what it ought to be. I need a change. Yes, Sir, I need a
change. There is something I ought to have at this time of year,
and I haven't got it. There is something that I used to have and
don't have now. Ha! I know! I need some fresh fruit. That's it&mdash;fresh
fruit! It must be about berry time now, and I'd forgotten all
about it. My, my, my, how good some berries would taste! Now if
I were back up there in the Great Woods I could have all I could
eat. Um-m-m-m! Makes my mouth water just to think of it. There
ought to be some up in the Old Pasture. There ought to be a lot
of 'em up there. If I wasn't afraid that some one would see me,
I'd go up there."</p>

<p>Buster sighed. Then he sighed again. The more he thought about
those berries he felt sure were growing in the Old Pasture, the
more he wanted some. It seemed to him that never in all his life
had he wanted berries as he did now. He wandered about uneasily.
He was hungry&mdash;hungry for berries and nothing else. By and by
he began talking to himself again.</p>

<p>"If I wasn't afraid of being seen, I'd go up to the Old Pasture
this very minute. Seems as if I could taste those berries." He
licked his lips hungrily as he spoke. Then his face brightened.
"I know what I'll do! I'll go up there at the very first peep
of day to-morrow. I can eat all I want and get back to the Green
Forest before there is any danger that Farmer Brown's boy or any
one else I'm afraid of will see me. That's just what I'll do.
My, I wish to-morrow morning would hurry up and come."</p>

<p>Now though Buster didn't know it, some one had been listening,
and that some one was none other than Sammy Jay. When at last
Buster lay down for a nap, Sammy flew away, chuckling to himself.
"I believe I'll visit the Old Pasture to-morrow morning myself,"
thought he. "I have an idea that something interesting may happen
if Buster doesn't change his mind."</p>

<p>Sammy was on the lookout very early the next morning. The first
Jolly Little Sunbeams had only reached the Green Meadows and had
not started to creep into the Green Forest, when he saw a big,
dark form steal out of the Green Forest where it joins the Old
Pasture. It moved very swiftly and silently, as if in a great
hurry. Sammy knew who it was: it was Buster Bear, and he was going
berrying. Sammy waited a little until he could see better. Then
he too started for the Old Pasture.</p>
