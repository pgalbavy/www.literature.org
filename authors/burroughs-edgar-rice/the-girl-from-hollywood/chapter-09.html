<p>Two weeks later Grace Evans left for Hollywood and fame. She would
permit no one to accompany her, saying that she wanted to feel that
from the moment she left home she had made her own way, unassisted,
toward her goal.
</p>
<p>Hers was the selfish egotism that is often to be found in otherwise
generous natures. She had never learned the sweetness and beauty of
sharing--of sharing her ambitions, her successes, and her failures,
too, with those who loved her. If she won to fame, the glory would be
hers; nor did it once occur to her that she might have shared that
pride and pleasure with others by accepting their help and advice. If
she failed, they would not have even the sad sweetness of sharing her
disappointment.
</p><p>Over two homes there hovered that evening a pall of gloom that no
effort seemed able to dispel. In the ranch house on Ganado they made
a brave effort at cheerfulness on Custer Pennington’s account. They
did not dance that evening, as was their custom, nor could they find
pleasure in the printed page when they tried to read. Bridge proved
equally impossible.
</p><p>Finally Custer rose, announcing that he was going to bed. Kissing them
all good night, as had been the custom since childhood, he went to his
room, and tears came to the mother’s eyes as she noted the droop in the
broad shoulders as he walked from the room.
</p><p>The girl came then and knelt beside her, taking the older woman’s hand
in hers and caressing it.
</p><p>“I feel so sorry for Cus,” she said. “I believe that none of us realize
how hard he is taking this. He told me yesterday that it was going to
be just the same as if Grace was dead, for he knew she would never be
satisfied here again, whether she succeeded or failed. I think he has
definitely given up all hope of their being married.”
</p><p>“Oh, no, dear, I am sure he is wrong,” said her mother. “The engagement
has not been broken. In fact Grace told me only a few days ago that
she hoped her success would come quickly, so that she and Custer might
be married the sooner. The dear girl wants us to be proud of our new
daughter.”
</p><p>“My God!” ejaculated the colonel, throwing his book down and rising to
pace the floor. “Proud of her! Weren’t we already proud of her? Will
being an actress make her any dearer to us? Of all the damn fool ideas!”
</p><p>“Custer! Custer! You mustn’t swear so before Eva,” reproved Mrs.
Pennington.
</p><p>“Swear?” he demanded. “Who in hell is swearing?”
</p><p>A merry peal of laughter broke from the girl, nor could her mother
refrain from smiling.
</p><p>“It isn’t swearing when popsy says it,” cried the girl. “My gracious,
I’ve heard it all my life, and you always say the same thing to him,
as if I’d never heard a single little cuss word. Anyway, I’m going to
bed now, popsy, so that you won’t contaminate me. According to momsy’s
theory she should curse like a pirate by this time, after twenty-five
years of it!”
</p><p>She kissed them, leaving them alone in the little family sitting room.
</p><p>“I hope the boy won’t take it too hard,” said the colonel after a
silence.
</p><p>“I am afraid he has been drinking a little too much lately,” said the
mother. “I only hope his loneliness for Grace won’t encourage it.”
</p><p>“I hadn’t noticed it,” said the colonel.
</p><p>“He never shows it much,” she replied. “An outsider would not know that
he had been drinking at all when I can see that he has had more than he
should.”
</p><p>“Don’t worry about that, dear,” said the colonel. “A Pennington never
drinks more than a gentleman should. His father and his grandsires, on
both sides, always drank, but there has never been a drunkard in either
family. I wouldn’t give two cents for him if he couldn’t take a man’s
drink like a man; but he’ll never go too far. My boy couldn’t!”
</p><p>The pride and affection in the words brought the tears to the mother’s
eyes. She wondered if there had ever been father and son like these
before--each with such implicit confidence in the honor, the integrity,
and the manly strength of the other. <u>His boy</u> couldn’t go wrong!
</p><p>Custer Pennington entered his room, lighted a reading lamp beside
a deep, wide-armed chair, selected a book from a rack, and settled
himself comfortably for an hour of pleasure and inspiration. But he did
not open the book. Instead, he sat staring blindly at the opposite wall.
</p><p>Directly in front of him hung a water color of the Apache, done by
Eva, and given to him the previous Christmas; a framed enlargement of
a photograph of a prize Hereford bull; a pair of rusty Spanish spurs;
and a frame of ribbons won by the Apache at various horse shows.
Custer saw none of these, but only a gloomy vista of dreary years
stretching through the dead monotony of endless ranch days that were
all alike--years that he must travel alone.
</p><p>She would never come back, and why should she? In the city, in that new
life, she would meet men of the world--men of broader culture than his,
men of wealth--and she would be sought after. They would have more to
offer her than he, and sooner or later she would realize it. He could
not expect to hold her.
</p><p>Custer laid aside his book.
</p><p>“What’s the use?” he asked himself.
</p><p>Rising, he went to the closet and brought out a bottle. He had not
intended drinking. On the contrary, he had determined very definitely
not to drink that night; but again he asked himself the old question
which, under certain circumstances of life and certain conditions of
seeming hopelessness, appears unanswerable:
</p><p>“What is the use?”
</p><p>It is a foolish question, a meaningless question, a dangerous question.
What is the use of what? Of combating fate--of declining to do the
thing we ought not to do--of doing the thing we should do? It is not
even a satisfactory means of self-justification; but amid the ruins of
his dreams it was sufficient excuse for Custer Pennington’s surrender
to the craving of an appetite which was daily becoming stronger.
</p><p>The next morning he did not ride before breakfast with the other
members of the family, nor, in fact, did he breakfast until long after
they.
</p><hr/>
<p>On the evening of the day of Grace’s departure Mrs. Evans retired
early, complaining of a headache. Guy Evans sought to interest himself
in various magazines, but he was restless and too ill at ease to remain
long absorbed. At frequent intervals he consulted his watch, and as
the evening wore on he made numerous trips to his room, where he had
recourse to a bottle like the one with which Custer Pennington was
similarly engaged.
</p><p>It was Friday--the second Friday since Guy had entered into an
agreement with Allen; and as midnight approached his nervousness
increased.
</p><p>Young Evans, while scarcely to be classed as a strong character, was
more impulsive than weak, nor was he in any sense of the word vicious.
While he knew that he was breaking the law, he would have been terribly
shocked at the merest suggestion that his acts placed upon him the
brand of criminality. Like many another, he considered the Volstead
Act the work of an organized and meddlesome minority, rather than the
real will of the people. There was, in his opinion, no immorality in
circumventing the Eighteenth Amendment whenever and wherever possible.
</p><p>The only fly in the ointment was the fact that the liquor in which he
was at present trafficking had been stolen; but he attempted to square
this with his conscience by the oft reiterated thought that he did
not know it to be stolen goods--they couldn’t prove that he knew it.
However, the fly remained. It must have been one of those extremely
obnoxious, buzzy flies, if one might judge by the boy’s increasing
nervousness.
</p><p>Time and again, during that long evening, he mentally reiterated his
determination that once this venture was concluded, he would never
embark upon another of a similar nature. The several thousand dollars
which it would net him would make it possible for him to marry Eva and
settle down to a serious and uninterrupted effort at writing--the one
vocation for which he believed himself best fitted by inclination and
preparation; but never again, he assured himself repeatedly, would he
allow himself to be cajoled or threatened into such an agreement.
</p><p>He disliked and feared Allen, whom he now knew to be a totally
unscrupulous man, and his introduction, the preceding Friday, to the
confederates who had brought down the first consignment of whisky
from the mountains had left him fairly frozen with apprehension as he
considered the type of ruffians with whom he was associated. During the
intervening week he had been unable to concentrate his mind upon his
story writing even to the extent of a single word of new material. He
had worried and brooded, and he had drunk more than usual.
</p><p>As he sat waiting for the arrival of the second consignment, he
pictured the little cavalcade winding downward along hidden trails
through the chaparral of dark, mountain ravines. His nervousness
increased as he realized the risk of discovery some time during the
six months that it would take to move the contraband to the edge of
the valley in this way--thirty-six cases at a time, packed out on six
burros.
</p><p>He had little fear of the failure of his plan for hiding the liquor in
the old hay barn and moving it out again the following day. For three
years there had been stored in one end of the barn some fifty tons of
baled melilotus. It had been sown as a cover crop by a former foreman,
and allowed to grow to such proportions as to render the plowing of it
under a practical impossibility. As hay it was in little or no demand,
but there was a possibility of a hay shortage that year. It was against
this possibility that Evans had had it baled and stored away in the
barn, where it had lain ever since, awaiting an offer that would at
least cover the cost of growing, harvesting, and baling. A hard day’s
work had so rearranged the bales as to form a hidden chamber in the
center of the pile, ingress to which could readily be had by removing a
couple of bales near the floor.
</p><p>A little after eleven o’clock Guy left the house and made his way to
the barn, where he paced nervously to and fro in the dark interior. He
hoped that the men would come early and get the thing over, for it was
this part of the operation that seemed most fraught with danger.
</p><p>The disposal of the liquor was effected by daylight, and the very
boldness and simplicity of the scheme seemed to assure its safety. A
large motor truck--such trucks are constantly seen upon the roads of
southern California, loaded with farm and orchard products and bound
cityward--drove up to the hay barn on the morning after the receipt of
the contraband. It backed into the interior, and half an hour later
it emerged with a small load of baled melilotus. That there were
thirty-six cases of bonded whisky concealed by the innocent-looking
bales of melilotus Mr. Volstead himself could not have guessed; but
such was the case.
</p><p>Where it went to after it left his hands Guy Evans did not know or want
to know. The man who bought it from him owned and drove the truck. He
paid Evans six dollars a quart in currency, and drove away, taking,
besides the load on the floor of the truck, a much heavier burden from
the mind of the young man.
</p><p>The whisky was in Guy’s possession for less than twelve hours a week;
but during those twelve hours he earned the commission of a dollar
a bottle that Allen allowed him, for his great fear was that sooner
or later some one would discover and follow the six burros as they
came down to the barn. There were often campers in the hills. During
the deer season, if they did not have it all removed by that time,
they would be almost certain of discovery, since every courageous
ribbon-counter clerk in Los Angeles hied valiantly to the mountains
with a high-powered rifle, to track the ferocious deer to its lair.
</p><p>At a quarter past twelve Evans heard the sounds for which he had been
so expectantly waiting. He opened a small door in the end of the hay
barn, through which there filed in silence six burdened burros, led by
one swarthy Mexican and followed by another. Quietly the men unpacked
the burros and stored the thirty-six cases in the chamber beneath the
hay. Inside this same chamber, by the light of a flash lamp, Evans
counted out to one of them the proceeds from the sale of the previous
week. The whole transaction consumed less than half an hour, and was
carried on with the exchange of less than a dozen words. As silently as
they had come the men departed, with their burros, into the darkness
toward the hills, and young Evans made his way to his room and to bed.
