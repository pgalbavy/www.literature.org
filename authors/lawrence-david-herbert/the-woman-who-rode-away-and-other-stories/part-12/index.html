<p>There was a woman who was beautiful, who started with all the
advantages, yet she had no luck.  She married for love, and the
love turned to dust.  She had bonny children, yet she felt they had
been thrust upon her, and she could not love them.  They looked at
her coldly, as if they were finding fault with her.  And hurriedly
she felt she must cover up some fault in herself.  Yet what it was
that she must cover up she never knew.  Nevertheless, when her
children were present, she always felt the centre of her heart go
hard.  This troubled her, and in her manner she was all the more
gentle and anxious for her children, as if she loved them very
much.  Only she herself knew that at the centre of her heart was a
hard little place that could not feel love, no, not for anybody.
Everybody else said of her:  &quot;She is such a good mother.  She
adores her children.&quot;  Only she herself, and her children
themselves, knew it was not so.  They read it in each other's eyes.</p>

<p>There were a boy and two little girls.  They lived in a pleasant
house, with a garden, and they had discreet servants, and felt
themselves superior to anyone in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Although they lived in style, they felt always an anxiety in the
house.  There was never enough money.  The mother had a small
income, and the father had a small income, but not nearly enough
for the social position which they had to keep up.  The father went
in to town to some office.  But though he had good prospects, these
prospects never materialised.  There was always the grinding sense
of the shortage of money, though the style was always kept up.</p>

<p>At last the mother said, &quot;I will see if <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> can't make something.&quot;
But she did not know where to begin.  She racked her brains, and
tried this thing and the other, but could not find anything
successful.  The failure made deep lines come into her face.  Her
children were growing up, they would have to go to school.  There
must be more money, there must be more money.  The father, who was
always very handsome and expensive in his tastes, seemed as if he
never WOULD be able to do anything worth doing.  And the mother,
who had a great belief in herself, did not succeed any better, and
her tastes were just as expensive.</p>

<p>And so the house came to be haunted by the unspoken phrase:  There
must be more money!  There must be more money!  The children could
hear it all the time, though nobody said it aloud.  They heard it
at Christmas, when the expensive and splendid toys filled the
nursery.  Behind the shining modern rocking-horse, behind the smart
doll's-house, a voice would start whispering:  &quot;There MUST be more
money!  There MUST be more money!&quot;  And the children would stop
playing, to listen for a moment.  They would look into each other's
eyes, to see if they had all heard.  And each one saw in the eyes
of the other two that they too had heard.  &quot;There MUST be more
money!  There MUST be more money!&quot;</p>

<p>It came whispering from the springs of the still-swaying rocking-
horse, and even the horse, bending his wooden, champing head, heard
it.  The big doll, sitting so pink and smirking in her new pram,
could hear it quite plainly, and seemed to be smirking all the more
self-consciously because of it.  The foolish puppy, too, that took
the place of the teddy-bear, he was looking so extraordinarily
foolish for no other reason but that he heard the secret whisper
all over the house:  &quot;There MUST be more money.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet nobody ever said it aloud.  The whisper was everywhere, and
therefore no one spoke it.  Just as no one ever says:  &quot;We are
breathing!&quot; in spite of the fact that breath is coming and going
all the time.</p>

<p>&quot;Mother!&quot; said the boy Paul one day.  &quot;Why don't we keep a car of
our own?  Why do we always use uncle's, or else a taxi?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because we're the poor members of the family,&quot; said the mother.</p>

<p>&quot;But why ARE we, mother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well - I suppose,&quot; she said slowly and bitterly, &quot;it's because your
father has no luck.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy was silent for some time.</p>

<p>&quot;Is luck money, mother?&quot; he asked, rather timidly.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Paul!  Not quite.  It's what causes you to have money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Paul vaguely.  &quot;I thought when Uncle Oscar said filthy
lucker, it meant money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Filthy lucre does mean money,&quot; said the mother.  &quot;But it's lucre,
not luck.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said the boy.  &quot;Then what IS luck, mother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's what causes you to have money.  If you're lucky you have
money.  That's why it's better to be born lucky than rich.  If
you're rich, you may lose your money.  But if you're lucky, you
will always get more money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!  Will you!  And is father not lucky?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very unlucky, I should say,&quot; she said bitterly.</p>

<p>The boy watched her with unsure eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know.  Nobody ever knows why one person is lucky and
another unlucky.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't they?  Nobody at all?  Does NOBODY know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps God!  But He never tells.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He ought to, then.  And aren't you lucky either, mother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't be, if I married an unlucky husband.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But by yourself, aren't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I used to think I was, before I married.  Now I think I am very
unlucky indeed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well - never mind!  Perhaps I'm not really,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>The child looked at her, to see if she meant it.  But he saw, by
the lines of her mouth, that she was only trying to hide something
from him.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, anyhow,&quot; he said stoutly, &quot;I'm a lucky person.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; said his mother, with a sudden laugh.</p>

<p>He stared at her.  He didn't even know why he had said it.</p>

<p>&quot;God told me,&quot; he asserted, brazening it out.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope He did, dear!&quot; she said, again with a laugh, but rather
bitter.</p>

<p>&quot;He did, mother!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Excellent!&quot; said the mother, using one of her husband's
exclamations.</p>

<p>The boy saw she did not believe him; or rather, that she paid no
attention to his assertion.  This angered him somewhere, and made
him want to compel her attention.</p>

<p>He went off by himself, vaguely, in a childish way, seeking for the
clue to &quot;luck&quot;.  Absorbed, taking no heed of other people, he went
about with a sort of stealth, seeking inwardly for luck.  He wanted
luck, he wanted it, he wanted it.  When the two girls were playing
dolls, in the nursery, he would sit on his big rocking-horse,
charging madly into space, with a frenzy that made the little girls
peer at him uneasily.  Wildly the horse careered, the waving dark
hair of the boy tossed, his eyes had a strange glare in them.  The
little girls dared not speak to him.</p>

<p>When he had ridden to the end of his mad little journey, he climbed
down and stood in front of his rocking-horse, staring fixedly into
its lowered face.  Its red mouth was slightly open, its big eye was
wide and glassy bright.</p>

<p>&quot;Now!&quot; he would silently command the snorting steed.  &quot;Now take me
to where there is luck!  Now take me!&quot;</p>

<p>And he would slash the horse on the neck with the little whip he
had asked Uncle Oscar for.  He KNEW the horse could take him to
where there was luck, if only he forced it.  So he would mount
again, and start on his furious ride, hoping at last to get there.
He knew he could get there.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll break your horse, Paul!&quot; said the nurse.</p>

<p>&quot;He's always riding like that!  I wish he'd leave off!&quot; said his
elder sister Joan.</p>

<p>But he only glared down on them in silence.  Nurse gave him up.
She could make nothing of him.  Anyhow he was growing beyond her.</p>

<p>One day his mother and his Uncle Oscar came in when he was on one
of his furious rides.  He did not speak to them.</p>

<p>&quot;Hallo! you young jockey!  Riding a winner?&quot; said his uncle.</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't you growing too big for a rocking-horse?  You're not a very
little boy any longer, you know,&quot; said his mother.</p>

<p>But Paul only gave a blue glare from his big, rather close-set
eyes.  He would speak to nobody when he was in full tilt.  His
mother watched him with an anxious expression on her face.</p>

<p>At last he suddenly stopped forcing his horse into the mechanical
gallop, and slid down.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I got there!&quot; he announced fiercely, his blue eyes still
flaring, and his sturdy long legs straddling apart.</p>

<p>&quot;Where did you get to?&quot; asked his mother.</p>

<p>&quot;Where I wanted to go to,&quot; he flared back at her.</p>

<p>&quot;That's right, son!&quot; said Uncle Oscar.  &quot;Don't you stop till you
get there.  What's the horse's name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He doesn't have a name,&quot; said the boy.</p>

<p>&quot;Gets on without all right?&quot; asked the uncle.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, he has different names.  He was called Sansovino last week.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sansovino, eh?  Won the Ascot.  How did you know his name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He always talks about horse-races with Bassett,&quot; said Joan.</p>

<p>The uncle was delighted to find that his small nephew was posted
with all the racing news.  Bassett, the young gardener who had been
wounded in the left foot in the war, and had got his present job
through Oscar Cresswell, whose batman he had been, was a perfect
blade of the &quot;turf&quot;.  He lived in the racing events, and the small
boy lived with him.</p>

<p>Oscar Cresswell got it all from Bassett.</p>

<p>&quot;Master Paul comes and asks me, so I can't do more than tell him,
sir,&quot; said Bassett, his face terribly serious, as if he were
speaking of religious matters.</p>

<p>&quot;And does he ever put anything on a horse he fancies?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well - I don't want to give him away - he's a young sport, a fine
sport, sir.  Would you mind asking him himself?  He sort of takes a
pleasure in it, and perhaps he'd feel I was giving him away, sir,
if you don't mind.&quot;</p>

<p>Bassett was serious as a church.</p>

<p>The uncle went back to his nephew, and took him off for a ride in
the car.</p>

<p>&quot;Say, Paul, old man, do you ever put anything on a horse?&quot; the
uncle asked.</p>

<p>The boy watched the handsome man closely.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, do you think I oughtn't to?&quot; he parried.</p>

<p>&quot;Not a bit of it!  I thought perhaps you might give me a tip for
the Lincoln.&quot;</p>

<p>The car sped on into the country, going down to Uncle Oscar's place
in Hampshire.</p>

<p>&quot;Honour bright?&quot; said the nephew.</p>

<p>&quot;Honour bright, son!&quot; said the uncle.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, Daffodil.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Daffodil!  I doubt it, sonny.  What about Mirza?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I only know the winner,&quot; said the boy.  &quot;That's Daffodil!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Daffodil, eh?&quot;  There was a pause.  Daffodil was an obscure horse
comparatively.</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, son?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You won't let it go any further, will you?  I promised Bassett.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bassett be damned, old man!  What's he got to do with it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're partners!  We've been partners from the first!  Uncle, he
lent me my first five shillings, which I lost.  I promised him,
honour bright, it was only between me and him: only you gave me
that ten-shilling note I started winning with, so I thought you
were lucky.  You won't let it go any further, will you?&quot;</p>

<p>The boy gazed at his uncle from those big, hot, blue eyes, set
rather close together.  The uncle stirred and laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>&quot;Right you are, son!  I'll keep your tip private.  Daffodil, eh!
How much are you putting on him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All except twenty pounds,&quot; said the boy.  &quot;I keep that in
reserve.&quot;</p>

<p>The uncle thought it a good joke.</p>

<p>&quot;You keep twenty pounds in reserve, do you, you young romancer?
What are you betting, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm betting three hundred,&quot; said the boy gravely.  &quot;But it's
between you and me, Uncle Oscar!  Honour bright?&quot;</p>

<p>The uncle burst into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;It's between you and me all right, you young Nat Gould,&quot; he said,
laughing.  &quot;But where's your three hundred?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bassett keeps it for me.  We're partners.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are, are you!  And what is Bassett putting on Daffodil?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He won't go quite as high as I do, I expect.  Perhaps he'll go a
hundred and fifty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, pennies?&quot; laughed the uncle.</p>

<p>&quot;Pounds,&quot; said the child, with a surprised look at his uncle.
&quot;Bassett keeps a bigger reserve than I do.&quot;</p>

<p>Between wonder and amusement, Uncle Oscar was silent.  He pursued
the matter no further, but he determined to take his nephew with
him to the Lincoln races.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, son,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm putting twenty on Mirza, and I'll put
five for you on any horse you fancy.  What's your pick?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Daffodil, uncle!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not the fiver on Daffodil!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should if it was my own fiver,&quot; said the child.</p>

<p>&quot;Good!  Good!  Right you are!  A fiver for me and a fiver for you
on Daffodil.&quot;</p>

<p>The child had never been to a race-meeting before, and his eyes
were blue fire.  He pursed his mouth tight, and watched.  A
Frenchman just in front had put his money on Lancelot.  Wild with
excitement, he flayed his arms up and down, yelling 'Lancelot!
Lancelot/' in his French accent.</p>

<p>Daffodil came in first, Lancelot second, Mirza third.  The child,
flushed and with eyes blazing, was curiously serene.  His uncle
brought him five five-pound notes: four to one.</p>

<p>&quot;What am I to do with these?&quot; he cried, waving them before the
boy's eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose we'll talk to Bassett,&quot; said the boy.  &quot;I expect I have
fifteen hundred now: and twenty in reserve: and this twenty.&quot;</p>

<p>His uncle studied him for some moments.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here, son!&quot; he said.  &quot;You're not serious about Bassett and
that fifteen hundred, are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I am.  But it's between you and me, uncle!  Honour bright!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Honour bright all right, son!  But I must talk to Bassett.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you'd like to be a partner, uncle, with Bassett and me, we
could all be partners.  Only you'd have to promise, honour bright,
uncle, not to let it go beyond us three.  Bassett and I are lucky,
and you must be lucky, because it was your ten shillings I started
winning with . . .&quot;</p>

<p>Uncle Oscar took both Bassett and Paul into Richmond Park for an
afternoon, and there they talked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's like this, you see, sir,&quot; Bassett said.  &quot;Master Paul would
get me talking about racing events, spinning yarns, you know, sir.
And he was always keen on knowing if I'd made or if I'd lost.  It's
about a year since, now, that I put five shillings on Blush of Dawn
for him: and we lost.  Then the luck turned, with that ten
shillings he had from you: that we put on Singhalese.  And since
that time, it's been pretty steady, all things considering.  What
do you say, Master Paul?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're all right when we're SURE,&quot; said Paul.  &quot;It's when we're not
quite sure that we go down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but we're careful then,&quot; said Bassett.</p>

<p>&quot;But when are you SURE?&quot; smiled Uncle Oscar.</p>

<p>&quot;It's Master Paul, sir,&quot; said Bassett, in a secret, religious
voice.  &quot;It's as if he had it from heaven.  Like Daffodil now, for
the Lincoln.  That was as sure as eggs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you put anything on Daffodil?&quot; asked Oscar Cresswell.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.  I made my bit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And my nephew?&quot;</p>

<p>Bassett was obstinately silent, looking at Paul.</p>

<p>&quot;I made twelve hundred, didn't I, Bassett?  I told uncle I was
putting three hundred on Daffodil.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right,&quot; said Bassett, nodding.</p>

<p>&quot;But where's the money?&quot; asked the uncle.</p>

<p>&quot;I keep it safe locked up, sir.  Master Paul, he can have it any
minute he likes to ask for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, fifteen hundred pounds?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And twenty!  And FORTY, that is, with the twenty he made on the
course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's amazing!&quot; said the uncle.</p>

<p>&quot;If Master Paul offers you to be partners, sir, I would, if I were
you: if you'll excuse me,&quot; said Bassett.</p>

<p>Oscar Cresswell thought about it.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll see the money,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>They drove home again, and sure enough, Bassett came round to the
garden-house with fifteen hundred pounds in notes.  The twenty
pounds reserve was left with Joe Glee, in the Turf Commission
deposit.</p>

<p>&quot;You see, it's all right, uncle, when I'm sure!  Then we go strong,
for all we're worth.  Don't we, Bassett?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We do that, Master Paul.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And when are you sure?&quot; said the uncle, laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, well, sometimes I'm ABSOLUTELY sure, like about Daffodil,&quot;
said the boy; &quot;and sometimes I have an idea; and sometimes I
haven't even an idea, have I, Bassett?  Then we're careful, because
we mostly go down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do, do you!  And when you're sure, like about Daffodil, what
makes you sure, sonny?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, well, I don't know,&quot; said the boy uneasily.  &quot;I'm sure, you
know, uncle; that's all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's as if he had it from heaven, sir,&quot; Bassett reiterated.</p>

<p>&quot;I should say so!&quot; said the uncle.</p>

<p>But he became a partner.  And when the Leger was coming on, Paul
was &quot;sure&quot; about Lively Spark, which was a quite inconsiderable
horse.  The boy insisted on putting a thousand on the horse,
Bassett went for five hundred, and Oscar Cresswell two hundred.
Lively Spark came in first, and the betting had been ten to one
against him.  Paul had made ten thousand.</p>

<p>&quot;You see,&quot; he said, &quot;I was absolutely sure of him.&quot;</p>

<p>Even Oscar Cresswell had cleared two thousand.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here, son,&quot; he said, &quot;this sort of thing makes me nervous.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It needn't, uncle!  Perhaps I shan't be sure again for a long
time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what are you going to do with your money?&quot; asked the uncle.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said the boy, &quot;I started it for mother.  She said she
had no luck, because father is unlucky, so I thought if <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> was
lucky, it might stop whispering.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What might stop whispering?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our house!  I HATE our house for whispering.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What does it whisper?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why - why&quot; - the boy fidgeted - &quot;why, I don't know!  But it's always
short of money, you know, uncle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know it, son, I know it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know people send mother writs, don't you, uncle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid I do,&quot; said the uncle.</p>

<p>&quot;And then the house whispers like people laughing at you behind
your back.  It's awful, that is!  I thought if I was lucky - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You might stop it,&quot; added the uncle.</p>

<p>The boy watched him with big blue eyes, that had an uncanny cold
fire in them, and he said never a word.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then!&quot; said the uncle.  &quot;What are we doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shouldn't like mother to know I was lucky,&quot; said the boy.</p>

<p>&quot;Why not, son?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She'd stop me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think she would.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; - and the boy writhed in an odd way - &quot;I DON'T want her to
know, uncle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right, son!  We'll manage it without her knowing.&quot;</p>

<p>They managed it very easily.  Paul, at the other's suggestion,
handed over five thousand pounds to his uncle, who deposited it
with the family lawyer, who was then to inform Paul's mother that a
relative had put five thousand pounds into his hands, which sum was
to be paid out a thousand pounds at a time, on the mother's
birthday, for the next five years.</p>

<p>&quot;So she'll have a birthday present of a thousand pounds for five
successive years,&quot; said Uncle Oscar.  &quot;I hope it won't make it all
the harder for her later.&quot;</p>

<p>Paul's mother had her birthday in November.  The house had been
&quot;whispering&quot; worse than ever lately, and even in spite of his luck,
Paul could not bear up against it.  He was very anxious to see the
effect of the birthday letter, telling his mother about the
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>When there were no visitors, Paul now took his meals with his
parents, as he was beyond the nursery control.  His mother went
into town nearly every day.  She had discovered that she had an odd
knack of sketching furs and dress materials, so she worked secretly
in the studio of a friend who was the chief &quot;artist&quot; for the
leading drapers.  She drew the figures of ladies in furs and ladies
in silk and sequins for the newspaper advertisements.  This young
woman artist earned several thousand pounds a year, but Paul's
mother only made several hundreds, and she was again dissatisfied.
She so wanted to be first in something, and she did not succeed,
even in making sketches for drapery advertisements.</p>

<p>She was down to breakfast on the morning of her birthday.  Paul
watched her face as she read her letters.  He knew the lawyer's
letter.  As his mother read it, her face hardened and became more
expressionless.  Then a cold, determined look came on her mouth.
She hid the letter under the pile of others, and said not a word
about it.</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't you have anything nice in the post for your birthday,
mother?&quot; said Paul.</p>

<p>&quot;Quite moderately nice,&quot; she said, her voice cold and absent.</p>

<p>She went away to town without saying more.</p>

<p>But in the afternoon Uncle Oscar appeared.  He said Paul's mother
had had a long interview with the lawyer, asking if the whole five
thousand could not be advanced at once, as she was in debt.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you think, uncle?&quot; said the boy.</p>

<p>&quot;I leave it to you, son.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, let her have it, then!  We can get some more with the other,&quot;
said the boy.</p>

<p>&quot;A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, laddie!&quot; said Uncle
Oscar.</p>

<p>&quot;But I'm sure to KNOW for the Grand National; or the Lincolnshire;
or else the Derby.  I'm sure to know for ONE of them,&quot; said Paul.</p>

<p>So Uncle Oscar signed the agreement, and Paul's mother touched the
whole five thousand.  Then something very curious happened.  The
voices in the house suddenly went mad, like a chorus of frogs on a
spring evening.  There were certain new furnishings, and Paul had a
tutor.  He was REALLY going to Eton, his father's school, in the
following autumn.  There were flowers in the winter, and a
blossoming of the luxury Paul's mother had been used to.  And yet
the voices in the house, behind the sprays of mimosa and almond-
blossom, and from under the piles of iridescent cushions, simply
trilled and screamed in a sort of ecstasy:  &quot;There MUST be more
money!  Oh-h-h!  There MUST be more money!  Oh, now, now-w!
now-w-w - there MUST be more money! - more than ever!  More than
ever!&quot;</p>

<p>It frightened Paul terribly.  He studied away at his Latin and
Greek with his tutors.  But his intense hours were spent with
Bassett.  The Grand National had gone by: he had not &quot;known&quot;, and
had lost a hundred pounds.  Summer was at hand.  He was in agony
for the Lincoln.  But even for the Lincoln he didn't &quot;know&quot;, and he
lost fifty pounds.  He became wild-eyed and strange, as if
something were going to explode in him.</p>

<p>&quot;Let it alone, son!  Don't you bother about it!&quot; urged Uncle Oscar.
But it was as if the boy couldn't really hear what his uncle was
saying.</p>

<p>&quot;I've got to know for the Derby!  I've GOT to know for the Derby!&quot;
the child reiterated, his big blue eyes blazing with a sort of
madness.</p>

<p>His mother noticed how overwrought he was.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd better go to the seaside.  Wouldn't you like to go now to
the seaside, instead of waiting?  I think you'd better,&quot; she said,
looking down at him anxiously, her heart curiously heavy because of
him.</p>

<p>But the child lifted his uncanny blue eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I couldn't possibly go before the Derby, mother!&quot; he said.  &quot;I
couldn't possibly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; she said, her voice becoming heavy when she was opposed.
&quot;Why not?  You can still go from the seaside to see the Derby with
your Uncle Oscar, if that's what you wish.  No need for you to wait
here.  Besides, I think you care too much about these races.  It's
a bad sign.  My family has been a gambling family, and you won't
know till you grow up how much damage it has done.  But it has done
damage.  I shall have to send Bassett away, and ask Uncle Oscar not
to talk racing to you, unless you promise to be reasonable about
it: go away to the seaside and forget it.  You're all nerves!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll do what you like, mother, so long as you don't send me away
till after the Derby,&quot; the boy said.</p>

<p>&quot;Send you away from where?  Just from this house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, gazing at her.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, you curious child, what makes you care about this house so
much, suddenly?  I never knew you loved it!&quot;</p>

<p>He gazed at her without speaking.  He had a secret within a secret,
something he had not divulged, even to Bassett or to his Uncle
Oscar.</p>

<p>But his mother, after standing undecided and a little bit sullen
for some moments, said:</p>

<p>&quot;Very well, then!  Don't go to the seaside till after the Derby, if
you don't wish it.  But promise me you won't let your nerves go to
pieces!  Promise you won't think so much about horse-racing and
EVENTS, as you call them!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no!&quot; said the boy, casually.  &quot;I won't think much about them,
mother.  You needn't worry.  I wouldn't worry, mother, if I were
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you were me and I were you,&quot; said his mother, &quot;I wonder what we
SHOULD do!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you know you needn't worry, mother, don't you?&quot; the boy
repeated.</p>

<p>&quot;I should be awfully glad to know it,&quot; she said wearily.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, well, you CAN, you know.  I mean you OUGHT to know you needn't
worry!&quot; he insisted.</p>

<p>&quot;Ought I?  Then I'll see about it,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Paul's secret of secrets was his wooden horse, that which had no
name.  Since he was emancipated from a nurse and a nursery
governess, he had had his rocking-horse removed to his own bedroom
at the top of the house.</p>

<p>&quot;Surely you're too big for a rocking-horse!&quot; his mother had
remonstrated.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you see, mother, till I can have a REAL horse, I like to
have SOME sort of animal about,&quot; had been his quaint answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you feel he keeps you company?&quot; she laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes!  He's very good, he always keeps me company, when I'm
there,&quot; said Paul.</p>

<p>So the horse, rather shabby, stood in an arrested prance in the
boy's bedroom.</p>

<p>The Derby was drawing near, and the boy grew more and more tense.
He hardly heard what was spoken to him, he was very frail, and his
eyes were really uncanny.  His mother had sudden strange seizures
of uneasiness about him.  Sometimes, for half an hour, she would
feel a sudden anxiety about him that was almost anguish.  She
wanted to rush to him at once, and know he was safe.</p>

<p>Two nights before the Derby, she was at a big party in town, when
one of her rushes of anxiety about her boy, her first-born, gripped
her heart till she could hardly speak.  She fought with the
feeling, might and main, for she believed in common-sense.  But it
was too strong.  She had to leave the dance and go downstairs to
telephone to the country.  The children's nursery governess was
terribly surprised and startled at being rung up in the night.</p>

<p>&quot;Are the children all right, Miss Wilmot?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, they are quite all right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Master Paul?  Is he all right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He went to bed as right as a trivet.  Shall I run up and look at
him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; said Paul's mother reluctantly.  &quot;No!  Don't trouble.  It's
all right.  Don't sit up.  We shall be home fairly soon.&quot;  She did
not want her son's privacy intruded upon.</p>

<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; said the governess.</p>

<p>It was about one o'clock when Paul's mother and father drove up to
their house.  All was still.  Paul's mother went to her room and
slipped off her white fur cloak.  She had told her maid not to wait
up for her.  She heard her husband downstairs, mixing a whisky-and-
soda.</p>

<p>And then, because of the strange anxiety at her heart, she stole
upstairs to her son's room.  Noiselessly she went along the upper
corridor.  Was there a faint noise?  What was it?</p>

<p>She stood, with arrested muscles, outside his door, listening.
There was a strange, heavy, and yet not loud noise.  Her heart
stood still.  It was a soundless noise, yet rushing and powerful.
Something huge, in violent, hushed motion.  What was it?  What in
God's Name was it?  She ought to know.  She felt that she KNEW the
noise.  She knew what it was.</p>

<p>Yet she could not place it.  She couldn't say what it was.  And on
and on it went, like a madness.</p>

<p>Softly, frozen with anxiety and fear, she turned the door-handle.</p>

<p>The room was dark.  Yet in the space near the window, she heard and
saw something plunging to and fro.  She gazed in fear and
amazement.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she switched on the light, and saw her son, in his
green pyjamas, madly surging on his rocking-horse.  The blaze of
light suddenly lit him up, as he urged the wooden horse, and lit
her up, as she stood, blonde, in her dress of pale green and
crystal, in the doorway.</p>

<p>&quot;Paul!&quot; she cried.  &quot;Whatever are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's Malabar!&quot; he screamed, in a powerful, strange voice.  &quot;It's
Malabar!&quot;</p>

<p>His eyes blazed at her for one strange and senseless second, as he
ceased urging his wooden horse.  Then he fell with a crash to the
ground, and she, all her tormented motherhood flooding upon her,
rushed to gather him up.</p>

<p>But he was unconscious, and unconscious he remained, with some
brain-fever.  He talked and tossed, and his mother sat stonily by
his side.</p>

<p>&quot;Malabar!  It's Malabar!  Bassett, Bassett, I KNOW: it's Malabar!&quot;</p>

<p>So the child cried, trying to get up and urge the rocking-horse
that gave him his inspiration.</p>

<p>&quot;What does he mean by Malabar?&quot; asked the heart-frozen mother.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said the father, stonily.</p>

<p>&quot;What does he mean by Malabar?&quot; she asked her brother Oscar.</p>

<p>&quot;It's one of the horses running for the Derby,&quot; was the answer.</p>

<p>And, in spite of himself, Oscar Cresswell spoke to Bassett, and
himself put a thousand on Malabar: at fourteen to one.</p>

<p>The third day of the illness was critical: they were watching for a
change.  The boy, with his rather long, curly hair, was tossing
ceaselessly on the pillow.  He neither slept nor regained
consciousness, and his eyes were like blue stones.  His mother sat,
feeling her heart had gone, turned actually into a stone.</p>

<p>In the evening, Oscar Cresswell did not come, but Bassett sent a
message, saying could he come up for one moment, just one moment?
Paul's mother was very angry at the intrusion, but on second
thoughts she agreed.  The boy was the same.  Perhaps Bassett might
bring him to consciousness.</p>

<p>The gardener, a shortish fellow with a little brown moustache and
sharp little brown eyes, tiptoed into the room, touched his
imaginary cap to Paul's mother, and stole to the bedside, staring
with glittering, smallish eyes at the tossing, dying child.</p>

<p>&quot;Master Paul!&quot; he whispered.  &quot;Master Paul!  Malabar came in first
all right, a clean win.  I did as you told me.  You've made over
seventy thousand pounds, you have; you've got over eighty thousand.
Malabar came in all right, Master Paul.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Malabar!  Malabar!  Did I say Malabar, mother?  Did I say Malabar?
Do you think I'm lucky, mother?  I knew Malabar, didn't I?  Over
eighty thousand pounds!  I call that lucky, don't you, mother?
Over eighty thousand pounds!  I knew, didn't I know I knew?
Malabar came in all right.  If I ride my horse till I'm sure, then
I tell you, Basset, you can go as high as you like.  Did you go for
all you were worth, Bassett?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I went a thousand on it, Master Paul.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never told you, mother, that if I can ride my horse, and GET
THERE, then I'm absolutely sure - oh, absolutely!  Mother, did I
ever tell you?  I AM lucky!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, you never did,&quot; said the mother.</p>

<p>But the boy died in the night.</p>

<p>And even as he lay dead, his mother heard her brother's voice
saying to her:  &quot;My God, Hester, you're eighty-odd thousand to the
good, and a poor devil of a son to the bad.  But, poor devil, poor
devil, he's best gone out of a life where he rides his rocking-
horse to find a winner.&quot;</p>
