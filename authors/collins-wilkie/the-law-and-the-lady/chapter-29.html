<P>
 A LITTLE interval of solitude was a relief to me, as well as to
Miserrimus Dexter.
<P>
Startling doubts beset me as I walked restlessly backward and
forward, now in the anteroom, and now in the corridor outside. It
was plain that I had (quite innocently) disturbed the repose of
some formidable secrets in Miserrimus Dexter's mind. I confused
and wearied my poor brains in trying to guess what the secrets
might be. All my ingenuity--as after-events showed me--was wasted
on speculations not one of which even approached the truth. I was
on surer ground when I arrived at the conclusion that Dexter had
really kept every mortal creature out of his confidence. He could
never have betrayed such serious signs of disturbance as I had
noticed in him, if he had publicly acknowledged at the Trial, or
if he had privately communicated to any chosen friend, all that
he knew of the tragic and terrible drama acted in the bedchamber
at Gleninch. What powerful influence had induced him to close his
lips? Had he been silent in mercy to others? or in dread of
consequences to himself? Impossible to tell! Could I hope that he
would confide to Me what he had kept secret from Justice and
Friendship alike? When he knew what I really wanted of him, would
he arm me, out of his own stores of knowledge, with the weapon
that would win me victory in the struggle to come? The chances
were against it--there was no denying that. Still the end was
worth trying for. The caprice of the moment might yet stand my
friend, with such a wayward being as Miserrimus Dexter. My plans
and projects were sufficiently strange, sufficiently wide of the
ordinary limits of a woman's thoughts and actions, to attract his
sympathies. "Who knows," I thought to myself, "if I may not take
his confidence by surprise, by simply telling him the truth?"
<P>
The interval expired; the door was thrown open; the voice of my
host summoned me again to the inner room.
<P>
"Welcome back!" said Miserrimus Dexter.
<P>
"Dear Mrs. Valeria, I am quite myself again. How are you?"
<P>
He looked and spoke with the easy cordiality of an old friend.
During the period of my absence, short as it was, another change
had passed over this most multiform of living beings. His eyes
sparkled with good-humor; his cheeks were flushing under a new
excitement of some sort. Even his dress had undergone alteration
since I had seen it last. He now wore an extemporized cap of
white paper; his ruffles were tucked up; a clean apron was thrown
over the sea-green coverlet. He hacked his chair before me,
bowing and smiling, and waved me to a seat with the grace of a
dancing master, chastened by the dignity of a lord in waiting.
<P>
"I am going to cook," he announced, with the most engaging
simplicity. "We both stand in need of refreshment before we
return to the serious business of our interview. You see me in my
cook's dress; forgive it. There is a form in these things. I am a
great stickler for forms. I have been taking some wine. Please
sanction that proceeding by taking some wine too."
<P>
He filled a goblet of ancient Venetian glass with a purple-red
liquor, beautiful to see.
<P>
"Burgundy!" he said--"the king of wine: And this is the king of
Burgundies--Clos Vougeot. I drink to your health and happiness!"
<P>
He filled a second goblet for himself, and honored the toast by
draining it to the bottom. I now understood the sparkle in his
eyes and the flush in his cheeks. It was my interest not to
offend him. I drank a little of his wine, and I quite agreed with
him. I thought it delicious.
<P>
"What shall we eat?" he asked. "It must be something worthy of
our Clos Vougeot. Ariel is good at roasting and boiling joints,
poor wretch! but I don't insult your taste by offering you
Ariel's cookery. Plain joints!" he exclaimed, with an expression
of refined disgust. "Bah! A man who eats a plain joint is only
one remove from a cannibal or a butcher. Will you leave it to me
to discover something more worthy of us? Let us go to the
kitchen."
<P>
He wheeled his chair around, and invited me to accompany him with
a courteous wave of his hand.
<P>
I followed the chair to some closed curtains at one end of the
room, which I had not hitherto noticed. Drawing aside the
curtains, he revealed to view an alcove, in which stood a neat
little gas-stove for cooking. Drawers and cupboards, plates,
dishes, and saucepans, were ranged around the alcove--all on a
miniature scale, all scrupulously bright and clean. "Welcome to
the kitchen!" said Miserrimus Dexter. He drew out of a recess in
the wall a marble slab, which served as a table, and reflected
profoundly, with his hand to his head. "I have it!" he cried, and
opening one of the cupboards next, took from it a black bottle of
a form that was new to me. Sounding this bottle with a spike, he
pierced and produced to view some little irregularly formed black
objects, which might have been familiar enough to a woman
accustomed to the luxurious tables of the rich, but which were a
new revelation to a person like myself, who
 had led a simple country life in the house of a clergyman with
small means. When I saw my host carefully lay out these occult
substances of uninviting appearance on a clean napkin, and then
plunge once more into profound reflection at the sight of them,
my curiosity could be no longer restrained. I ventured to say,
"What are those things, Mr. Dexter, and are we really going to
eat them?"
<P>
He started at the rash question, and looked at me with hands
outspread in irrepressible astonishment.
<P>
"Where is our boasted progress?" he cried. What is education but
a name? Here is a cultivated person who doesn't know Truffles
when she sees them!"
<P>
"I have heard of truffles," I answered, humbly, "but I never saw
them before. We had no such foreign luxuries as those, Mr.
Dexter, at home in the North."
<P>
Miserrimus Dexter lifted one of the truffles tenderly on his
spike, and held it up to me in a favorable light.
<P>
"Make the most of one of the few first sensations in this life
which has no ingredient of disappointment lurking under the
surface," he said. "Look at it; meditate over it. You shall eat
it, Mrs. Valeria, stewed in Burgundy!"
<P>
He lighted the gas for cooking with the air of a man who was
about to offer me an inestimable proof of his good-will.
<P>
"Forgive me if I observe the most absolute silence," he said,
"dating from the moment when I take this in my hand." He produced
a bright little stew-pan from his collection of culinary utensils
as he spoke. "Properly pursued, the Art of Cookery allows of no
divided attention," he continued, gravely. "In that observation
you will find the reason why no woman ever has reached, or ever
will reach, the highest distinction as a cook. As a rule, women
are incapable of absolutely concentrating their attention on any
one occupation for any given time. Their minds will run on
something else--say; typically, for the sake of illustration,
their sweetheart or their new bonnet. The one obstacle, Mrs.
Valeria, to your rising equal to the men in the various
industrial processes of life is not raised, as the women vainly
suppose, by the defective institutions of the age they live in.
No! the obstacle is in themselves. No institutions that can be
devised to encourage them will ever be strong enough to contend
successfully with the sweetheart and the new bonnet. A little
while ago, for instance, I was instrumental in getting women
employed in our local post-office here. The other day I took the
trouble--a serious business to me--of getting downstairs, and
wheeling myself away to the office to see how they were getting
on. I took a letter with me to register. It had an unusually long
address. The registering woman began copying the address on the
receipt form, in a business-like manner cheering and delightful
to see. Half way through, a little child-sister of one of the
other women employed trotted into the office, and popped under
the counter to go and speak to her relative. The registering
woman's mind instantly gave way. Her pencil stopped; her eyes
wandered off to the child with a charming expression of interest.
'Well, Lucy,' she said, 'how d'ye do?' Then she remembered
business again, and returned to her receipt. When I took it
across the counter, an important line in the address of my letter
was left out in the copy. Thanks to Lucy. Now a man in the same
position would not have seen Lucy--he would have been too closely
occupied with what he was about at the moment. There is the whole
difference between the mental constitution of the sexes, which no
legislation will ever alter as long as the world lasts! What does
it matter? Women are infinitely superior to men in the moral
qualities which are the true adornments of humanity. Be
content--oh, my mistaken sisters, be content with that!"
<P>
He twisted his chair around toward the stove. It was useless to
dispute the question with him, even if I had felt inclined to do
so. He absorbed himself in his stew-pan.
<P>
I looked about me in the room.
<P>
The same insatiable relish for horrors exhibited downstairs by
the pictures in the hall was displayed again here. The
photographs hanging on the wall represented the various forms of
madness taken from the life. The plaster casts ranged on the
shelf opposite were casts (after death) of the heads of famous
murderers. A frightful little skeleton of a woman hung in a
cupboard, behind a glazed door, with this cynical inscription
placed above the skull: "Behold the scaffolding on which beauty
is built!" In a corresponding cupboard, with the door wide open,
there hung in loose folds a shirt (as I took it to be) of chamois
leather. Touching it (and finding it to be far softer than any
chamois leather that my fingers had ever felt before), I
disarranged the folds, and disclosed a ticket pinned among them,
describing the thing in these horrid lines: "Skin of a French
Marquis, tanned in the Revolution of Ninety-three. Who says the
nobility are not good for something? They make good leather."
<P>
After this last specimen of my host's taste in curiosities, I
pursued my investigation no further. I returned to my chair, and
waited for the truffles.
<P>
After a brief interval, the voice of the
poet-painter-composer-and-cook summoned me back to the alcove.
<P>
The gas was out. The stew-pan and its accompaniments had
vanished. On the marble slab were two plates, two napkins, two
rolls of bread, and a dish, with another napkin in it, on which
reposed two quaint little black balls. Miserrimus Dexter,
regarding me with a smile of benevolent interest, put one of the
balls on my plate, and took the other himself. "Compose yourself,
Mrs. Valeria," he said. "This is an epoch in your life. Your
first Truffle! Don't touch it with the knife. Use the fork alone.
And--pardon me; this is most important--eat slowly."
<P>
I followed my instructions, and assumed an enthusiasm which I
honestly confess I did not feel. I privately thought the new
vegetable a great deal too rich, and in other respects quite
unworthy of the fuss that had been made about it. Miserrimus
Dexter lingered and languished over his truffles, and sipped his
wonderful Burgundy, and sang his own praises as a cook until I
was really almost mad with impatience to return to the real
object of my visit. In the reckless state of mind which this
feeling produced, I abruptly reminded my host that he was wasting
our time, by the most dangerous question that I could possibly
put to him.
<P>
"Mr. Dexter," I said, "have you seen anything lately of Mrs.
Beauly?"
<P>
The easy sense of enjoyment expressed in his face left it at
those rash words, and went out like a suddenly extinguished
light. That furtive distrust of me which I had already noticed
instantly made itself felt again in his manner and in his voice.
<P>
"Do you know Mrs. Beauly?" he asked.
<P>
"I only know her," I answered, "by what I have read of her in the
Trial."
<P>
He was not satisfied with that reply.
<P>
"You must have an interest of some sort in Mrs. Beauly," he said,
"or you would not have asked me about her. Is it the interest of
a friend, or the interest of an enemy?"
<P>
Rash as I might be, I was not quite reckless enough yet to meet
that plain question by an equally plain reply. I saw enough in
his face to warn me to be careful with him before it was too
late.
<P>
"I can only answer you in one way," I rejoined. "I must return to
a subject which is very painful to you--the subject of the
Trial."
<P>
"Go on," he said, with one of his grim outbursts of humor. "Here
I am at your mercy--a martyr at the stake. Poke the fire! poke
the fire!"
<P>
"I am only an ignorant woman," I resumed, "and I dare say I am
quite wrong; but there is one part of my husband's trial which
doesn't at all satisfy me. The defense set up for him seems to me
to have been a complete mistake."
<P>
"A complete mistake?" he repeated. "Strange language, Mrs.
Valeria, to say the least of it!" He tried to speak lightly; he
took up his goblet of wine; but I could see that I had produced
an effect on him. His hand trembled as it carried the wine to his
lips.
<P>
"I don't doubt that Eustace's first wife really asked him to buy
the arsenic," I continued. "I don't doubt that she used it
secretly to improve her complexion. But w hat I do _not_ believe
is that she died of an overdose of the poison, taken by mistake."
<P>
He put back the goblet of wine on the table near him so
unsteadily that he spilled the greater part of it. For a moment
his eyes met mine, then looked down again.
<P>
"How do you believe she died?" he inquired, in tones so low that
I could barely hear them.
<P>
"By the hand of a poisoner," I answered.
<P>
He made a movement as if he were about to start up in the chair,
and sank back again, seized, apparently, with a sudden faintness.
<P>
"Not my husband!" I hastened to add. "You know that I am
satisfied of _his_ innocence."
<P>
I saw him shudder. I saw his hands fasten their hold convulsively
on the arms of his chair.
<P>
"Who poisoned her?" he asked, still lying helplessly back in the
chair.
<P>
At the critical moment my courage failed me. I was afraid to tell
him in what direction my suspicions pointed.
<P>
"Can't you guess?" I said.
<P>
There was a pause. I supposed him to be seceretly following his
own train of thought. It was not for long. On a sudden he started
up in his chair. The prostration which had possessed him appeared
to vanish in an instant. His eyes recovered their wild light; his
hands were steady again; his color was brighter than ever. Had he
been pondering over the secret of my interest in Mrs. Beauly? and
had he guessed? He had!
<P>
"Answer on your word of honor!" he cried. "Don't attempt to
deceive me! Is it a woman?"
<P>
"It is."
<P>
"What is the first letter of her name? Is it one of the first
three letters of the alphabet?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"B?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Beauly?"
<P>
"Beauly."
<P>
He threw his hands up above his head, and burst into a frantic
fit of laughter.
<P>
"I have lived long enough!" he broke out, wildly. "At last I have
discovered one other person in the world who sees it as plainly
as I do. Cruel Mrs. Valeria! why did you torture me? Why didn't
you own it before?"
<P>
"What!" I exclaimed, catching the infection of his excitement.
"Are _your_ ideas _my_ ideas? Is it possible that _you_ suspect
Mrs. Beauly too?"
<P>
He made this remarkable reply:
<P>
"Suspect?" he repeated, contemptuously. "There isn't the shadow
of a doubt about it. Mrs. Beauly poisoned her."
