<P>
Francine was awakened the next morning by one of the housemaids,
bringing up her breakfast on a tray. Astonished at this
concession to laziness, i n an institution devoted to the
practice of all virtues, she looked round. The bedroom was
deserted.
<P>
"The other young ladies are as busy as bees, miss," the housemaid
explained. "They were up and dressed two hours ago: and the
breakfast has been cleared away long since. It's Miss Emily's
fault. She wouldn't allow them to wake you; she said you could be
of no possible use downstairs, and you had better be treated like
a visitor. Miss Cecilia was so distressed at your missing your
breakfast that she spoke to the housekeeper, and I was sent up to
you. Please to excuse it if the tea's cold. This is Grand Day,
and we are all topsy-turvy in consequence."
<P>
Inquiring what "Grand Day" meant, and why it produced this
extraordinary result in a ladies' school, Francine discovered
that the first day of the vacation was devoted to the
distribution of prizes, in the presence of parents, guardians and
friends. An Entertainment was added, comprising those merciless
tests of human endurance called Recitations; light refreshments
and musical performances being distributed at intervals, to
encourage the exhausted audience. The local newspaper sent a
reporter to describe the proceedings, and some of Miss Ladd's
young ladies enjoyed the intoxicating luxury of seeing their
names in print.
<P>
"It begins at three o'clock," the housemaid went on, "and, what
with practicing and rehearsing, and ornamenting the schoolroom,
there's a hubbub fit to make a person's head spin. Besides
which," said the girl, lowering her voice, and approaching a
little nearer to Francine, "we have all been taken by surprise.
The first thing in the morning Miss Jethro left us, without
saying good-by to anybody."
<P>
"Who is Miss Jethro?"
<P>
"The new teacher, miss. We none of us liked her, and we all
suspect there's something wrong. Miss Ladd and the clergyman had
a long talk together yesterday (in private, you know), and they
sent for Miss Jethro--which looks bad, doesn't it? Is there
anything more I can do for you, miss? It's a beautiful day after
the rain. If I was you, I should go and enjoy myself in the
garden."
<P>
Having finished her breakfast, Francine decided on profiting by
this sensible suggestion.
<P>
The servant who showed her the way to the garden was not
favorably impressed by the new pupil: Francine's temper asserted
itself a little too plainly in her face. To a girl possessing a
high opinion of her own importance it was not very agreeable to
feel herself excluded, as an illiterate stranger, from the one
absorbing interest of her schoolfellows. "Will the time ever
come," she wondered bitterly, "when I shall win a prize, and sing
and play before all the company? How I should enjoy making the
girls envy me!"
<P>
A broad lawn, overshadowed at one end by fine old trees--flower
beds and shrubberies, and winding paths prettily and invitingly
laid out--made the garden a welcome refuge on that fine summer
morning. The novelty of the scene, after her experience in the
West Indies, the delicious breezes cooled by the rain of the
night, exerted their cheering influence even on the sullen
disposition of Francine. She smiled, in spite of herself, as she
followed the pleasant paths, and heard the birds singing their
summer songs over her head.
<P>
Wandering among the trees, which occupied a considerable extent
of ground, she passed into an open space beyond, and discovered
an old fish-pond, overgrown by aquatic plants. Driblets of water
trickled from a dilapidated fountain in the middle. On the
further side of the pond the ground sloped downward toward the
south, and revealed, over a low paling, a pretty view of a
village and its church, backed by fir woods mounting the heathy
sides of a range of hills beyond. A fanciful little wooden
building, imitating the form of a Swiss cottage, was placed so as
to command the prospect. Near it, in the shadow of the building,
stood a rustic chair and table--with a color-box on one, and a
portfolio on the other. Fluttering over the grass, at the mercy
of the capricious breeze, was a neglected sheet of drawing-paper.
Francine ran round the pond, and picked up the paper just as it
was on the point of being tilted into the water. It contained a
sketch in water colors of the village and the woods, and Francine
had looked at the view itself with indifference--the picture of
the view interested her. Ordinary visitors to Galleries of Art,
which admit students, show the same strange perversity. The work
of the copyist commands their whole attention; they take no
interest in the original picture.
<P>
Looking up from the sketch, Francine was startled. She discovered
a man, at the window of the Swiss summer-house, watching her.
<P>
"When you have done with that drawing," he said quietly, "please
let me have it back again."
<P>
He was tall and thin and dark. His finely-shaped intelligent
face--hidden, as to the lower part of it, by a curly black
beard--would have been absolutely handsome, even in the eyes of a
schoolgirl, but for the deep furrows that marked it prematurely
between the eyebrows, and at the sides of the mouth. In the same
way, an underlying mockery impaired the attraction of his
otherwise refined and gentle manner. Among his fellow-creatures,
children and dogs were the only critics who appreciated his
merits without discovering the defects which lessened the
favorable appreciation of him by men and women. He dressed
neatly, but his morning coat was badly made, and his picturesque
felt hat was too old. In short, there seemed to be no good
quality about him which was not perversely associated with a
drawback of some kind. He was one of those harmless and luckless
men, possessed of excellent qualities, who fail nevertheless to
achieve popularity in their social sphere.
<P>
Francine handed his sketch to him, through the window; doubtful
whether the words that he had addressed to her were spoken in
jest or in earnest.
<P>
"I only presumed to touch your drawing," she said, "because it
was in danger."
<P>
"What danger?" he inquired.
<P>
Francine pointed to the pond. "If I had not been in time to pick
it up, it would have been blown into the water."
<P>
"Do you think it was worth picking up?"
<P>
Putting that question, he looked first at the sketch--then at the
view which it represented--then back again at the sketch. The
corners of his mouth turned upward with a humorous expression of
scorn. "Madam Nature," he said, "I beg your pardon." With those
words, he composedly tore his work of art into small pieces, and
scattered them out of the window.
<P>
"What a pity!" said Francine.
<P>
He joined her on the ground outside the cottage. "Why is it a
pity?" he asked.
<P>
"Such a nice drawing."
<P>
"It isn't a nice drawing."
<P>
"You're not very polite, sir."
<P>
He looked at her--and sighed as if he pitied so young a woman for
having a temper so ready to take offense. In his flattest
contradictions he always preserved the character of a
politely-positive man.
<P>
"Put it in plain words, miss," he replied. "I have offended the
predominant sense in your nature--your sense of self-esteem. You
don't like to be told, even indirectly, that you know nothing of
Art. In these days, everybody knows everything--and thinks
nothing worth knowing after all. But beware how you presume on an
appearance of indifference, which is nothing but conceit in
disguise. The ruling passion of civilized humanity is, Conceit.
You may try the regard of your dearest friend in any other way,
and be forgiven. Ruffle the smooth surface of your friend's
self-esteem--and there will be an acknowledged coolness between
you which will last for life. Excuse me for giving you the
benefit of my trumpery experience. This sort of smart talk is
_my_ form of conceit. Can I be of use to you in some better way?
Are you looking for one of our young ladies?"
<P>
Francine began to feel a certain reluctant interest in him when
he spoke of "our young ladies." She asked if he belonged to the
school.
<P>
The corners of his mouth turned up again. "I'm one of the
masters," he said. "Are _you_ going to belong to the school,
too?"
<P>
Francine bent her head, with a gravity and condescension intended
to keep him at his proper distance. Far from being discouraged,
he permitted his curiosity to t ake additional liberties. "Are
you to have the misfortune of being one of my pupils?" he asked.
<P>
"I don't know who you are."
<P>
"You won't be much wiser when you do know. My name is Alban
Morris."
<P>
Francine corrected herself. "I mean, I don't know what you
teach."
<P>
Alban Morris pointed to the fragments of his sketch from Nature.
"I am a bad artist," he said. "Some bad artists become Royal
Academicians. Some take to drink. Some get a pension. And some--I
am one of them--find refuge in schools. Drawing is an 'Extra' at
this school. Will you take my advice? Spare your good father's
pocket; say you don't want to learn to draw."
<P>
He was so gravely in earnest that Francine burst out laughing.
"You are a strange man," she said.
<P>
"Wrong again, miss. I am only an unhappy man."
<P>
The furrows in his face deepened, the latent humor died out of
his eyes. He turned to the summer-house window, and took up a
pipe and tobacco pouch, left on the ledge.
<P>
"I lost my only friend last year," he said. "Since the death of
my dog, my pipe is the one companion I have left. Naturally I am
not allowed to enjoy the honest fellow's society in the presence
of ladies. They have their own taste in perfumes. Their clothes
and their letters reek with the foetid secretion of the musk
deer. The clean vegetable smell of tobacco is unendurable to
them. Allow me to retire--and let me thank you for the trouble
you took to save my drawing."
<P>
The tone of indifference in which he expressed his gratitude
piqued Francine. She resented it by drawing her own conclusion
from what he had said of the ladies and the musk deer. "I was
wrong in admiring your drawing," she remarked; "and wrong again
in thinking you a strange man. Am I wrong, for the third time, in
believing that you dislike women?"
<P>
"I am sorry to say you are right," Alban Morris answered gravely.
<P>
"Is there not even one exception?"
<P>
The instant the words passed her lips, she saw that there was
some secretly sensitive feeling in him which she had hurt. His
black brows gathered into a frown, his piercing eyes looked at
her with angry surprise. It was over in a moment. He raised his
shabby hat, and made her a bow.
<P>
"There is a sore place still left in me," he said; "and you have
innocently hit it. Good-morning."
<P>
Before she could speak again, he had turned the corner of the
summer-house, and was lost to view in a shrubbery on the westward
side of the grounds.
