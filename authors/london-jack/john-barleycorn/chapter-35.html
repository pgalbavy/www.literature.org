But the freight has to be paid.  John Barleycorn began to collect,
and he collected not so much from the body as from the mind.  The
old long sickness, which had been purely an intellectual sickness,
recrudesced.  The old ghosts, long laid, lifted their heads again. 
But they were different and more deadly ghosts.  The old ghosts,
intellectual in their inception, had been laid by a sane and
normal logic.  But now they were raised by the White Logic of John
Barleycorn, and John Barleycorn never lays the ghosts of his
raising.  For this sickness of pessimism, caused by drink, one
must drink further in quest of the anodyne that John Barleycorn
promises but never delivers.
<P>
How to describe this White Logic to those who have never
experienced it! It is perhaps better first to state how impossible
such a description is.  Take Hasheesh Land, for instance, the land 
of enormous extensions of time and space.  In past years I have
made two memorable journeys into that far land.  My adventures
there are seared in sharpest detail on my brain.  Yet I have tried
vainly, with endless words, to describe any tiny particular phase
to persons who have not travelled there.
<P>
I use all the hyperbole of metaphor, and tell what centuries of
time and profounds of unthinkable agony and horror can obtain in
each interval of all the intervals between the notes of a quick
jig played quickly on the piano.  I talk for an hour, elaborating
that one phase of Hasheesh Land, and at the end I have told them
nothing.  And when I cannot tell them this one thing of all the
vastness of terrible and wonderful things, I know I have failed to
give them the slightest concept of Hasheesh Land.
<P>
But let me talk with some other traveller in that weird region,
and at once am I understood.  A phrase, a word, conveys instantly
to his mind what hours of words and phrases could not convey to
the mind of the non-traveller.  So it is with John Barleycorn's
realm where the White Logic reigns.  To those untravelled there,
the traveller's account must always seem unintelligible and
fantastic.  At the best, I may only beg of the untravelled ones to
strive to take on faith the narrative I shall relate.
<P>
For there are fatal intuitions of truth that reside in alcohol. 
Philip sober vouches for Philip drunk in this matter.  There seem
to be various orders of truth in this world.  Some sorts of truth
are truer than others.  Some sorts of truth are lies, and these
sorts are the very ones that have the greatest use-value to life
that desires to realise and live.  At once, O untravelled reader,
you see how lunatic and blasphemous is the realm I am trying to
describe to you in the language of John Barleycorn's tribe.  It is
not the language of your tribe, all of whose members resolutely
shun the roads that lead to death and tread only the roads that
lead to life.  For there are roads and roads, and of truth there
are orders and orders.  But have patience.  At least, through what
seems no more than verbal yammerings, you may, perchance, glimpse
faint far vistas of other lands and tribes.
<P>
Alcohol tells truth, but its truth is not normal.  What is normal
is healthful.  What is healthful tends toward life.  Normal truth
is a different order, and a lesser order, of truth.  Take a dray
horse.  Through all the vicissitudes of its life, from first to
last, somehow, in unguessably dim ways, it must believe that life
is good; that the drudgery in harness is good; that death, no
matter how blind-instinctively apprehended, is a dread giant; that
life is beneficent and worth while; that, in the end, with fading
life, it will not be knocked about and beaten and urged beyond its
sprained and spavined best; that old age, even, is decent,
dignified, and valuable, though old age means a ribby scare-crow
in a hawker's cart, stumbling a step to every blow, stumbling
dizzily on through merciless servitude and slow disintegration to
the end--the end, the apportionment of its parts (of its subtle
flesh, its pink and springy bone, its juices and ferments, and all
the sensateness that informed it) to the chicken farm, the hide-
house, the glue-rendering works, and the bone-meal fertiliser
factory.  To the last stumble of its stumbling end this dray horse
must abide by the mandates of the lesser truth that is the truth
of life and that makes life possible to persist.
<P>
This dray horse, like all other horses, like all other animals,
including man, is life-blinded and sense-struck.  It will live, no
matter what the price.  The game of life is good, though all of
life may be hurt, and though all lives lose the game in the end. 
This is the order of truth that obtains, not for the universe, but
for the live things in it if they for a little space will endure
ere they pass.  This order of truth, no matter how erroneous it
may be, is the sane and normal order of truth, the rational order
&f truth that life must believe in order to live.
<P>
To man, alone among the animals, has been given the awful
privilege of reason.  Man, with his brain, can penetrate the
intoxicating show of things and look upon the universe brazen with
indifference toward him and his dreams.  He can do this, but it is
not well for him to do it.  To live, and live abundantly, to sting
with life, to be alive (which is to be what he is), it is good
that man be life-blinded and sense-struck.  What is good is true. 
And this is the order of truth, lesser though it be, that man must
know and guide his actions by with unswerving certitude that it is
absolute truth and that in the universe no other order of truth
can obtain.  It is good that man should accept at face value the
cheats of sense and snares of flesh and through the fogs of
sentiency pursue the lures and lies of passion.  It is good that
he shall see neither shadows nor futilities, nor be appalled by
his lusts and rapacities.
<P>
And man does this.  Countless men have glimpsed that other and
truer order of truth and recoiled from it.  Countless men have
passed through the long sickness and lived to tell of it and
deliberately to forget it to the end of their days.  They lived. 
They realised life, for life is what they were.  They did right.
<P>
And now comes John Barleycorn with the curse he lays upon the
imaginative man who is lusty with life and desire to live.  John
Barleycorn sends his White Logic, the argent messenger of truth
beyond truth, the antithesis of life, cruel and bleak as
interstellar space, pulseless and frozen as absolute zero,
dazzling with the frost of irrefragable logic and unforgettable
fact.  John Barleycorn will not let the dreamer dream, the liver
live.  He destroys birth and death, and dissipates to mist the
paradox of being, until his victim cries out, as in "The City of
Dreadful Night": "Our life's a cheat, our death a black abyss."
And the feet of the victim of such dreadful intimacy take hold of
the way of death.
