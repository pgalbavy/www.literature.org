<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

<P>Rosa, beyond herself and nearly mad with joy and fear at the 
idea of the black tulip being found again, started for the 
White Swan, followed by the boatman, a stout lad from 
Frisia, who was strong enough to knock down a dozen Boxtels 
single-handed.</P>
<P>He had been made acquainted in the course of the journey 
with the state of affairs, and was not afraid of any 
encounter; only he had orders, in such a case, to spare the 
tulip.</P>
<P>But on arriving in the great market-place Rosa at once 
stopped, a sudden thought had struck her, just as Homer's 
Minerva seizes Achilles by the hair at the moment when he is 
about to be carried away by his anger.</P>
<P>&quot;Good Heaven!&quot; she muttered to herself, &quot;I have made a 
grievous blunder; it may be I have ruined Cornelius, the 
tulip, and myself. I have given the alarm, and perhaps 
awakened suspicion. I am but a woman; these men may league 
themselves against me, and then I shall be lost. If I am 
lost that matters nothing,  -  but Cornelius and the tulip!&quot;</P>
<P>She reflected for a moment.</P>
<P>&quot;If I go to that Boxtel, and do not know him; if that Boxtel 
is not my Jacob, but another fancier, who has also 
discovered the black tulip; or if my tulip has been stolen 
by some one else, or has already passed into the hands of a 
third person;  -  if I do not recognize the man, only the 
tulip, how shall I prove that it belongs to me? On the other 
hand, if I recognise this Boxtel as Jacob, who knows what 
will come out of it? whilst we are contesting with each 
other, the tulip will die.&quot;</P>
<P>In the meanwhile, a great noise was heard, like the distant 
roar of the sea, at the other extremity of the market-place. 
People were running about, doors opening and shutting, Rosa 
alone was unconscious of all this hubbub among the 
multitude.</P>
<P>&quot;We must return to the President,&quot; she muttered.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, let us return,&quot; said the boatman.</P>
<P>They took a small street, which led them straight to the 
mansion of Mynheer van Systens, who with his best pen in his 
finest hand continued to draw up his report.</P>
<P>Everywhere on her way Rosa heard people speaking only of the 
black tulip, and the prize of a hundred thousand guilders. 
The news had spread like wildfire through the town.</P>
<P>Rosa had not a little difficulty is penetrating a second 
time into the office of Mynheer van Systens, who, however, 
was again moved by the magic name of the black tulip.</P>
<P>But when he recognised Rosa, whom in his own mind he had set 
down as mad, or even worse, he grew angry, and wanted to 
send her away.</P>
<P>Rosa, however, clasped her hands, and said with that tone of 
honest truth which generally finds its way to the hearts of 
men,  - </P>
<P>&quot;For Heaven's sake, sir, do not turn me away; listen to what 
I have to tell you, and if it be not possible for you to do 
me justice, at least you will not one day have to reproach 
yourself before God for having made yourself the accomplice 
of a bad action.&quot;</P>
<P>Van Systens stamped his foot with impatience; it was the 
second time that Rosa interrupted him in the midst of a 
composition which stimulated his vanity, both as a 
burgomaster and as President of the Horticultural Society.</P>
<P>&quot;But my report!&quot; he cried,  -  &quot;my report on the black 
tulip!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mynheer van Systens,&quot; Rosa continued, with the firmness of 
innocence and truth, &quot;your report on the black tulip will, 
if you don't hear me, be based on crime or on falsehood. I 
implore you, sir, let this Master Boxtel, whom I assert to 
be Master Jacob, be brought here before you and me, and I 
swear that I will leave him in undisturbed possession of the 
tulip if I do not recognise the flower and its holder.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I declare, here is a proposal,&quot; said Van Systens.</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I ask you what can be proved by your recognising them?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;After all,&quot; said Rosa, in her despair, &quot;you are an honest 
man, sir; how would you feel if one day you found out that 
you had given the prize to a man for something which he not 
only had not produced, but which he had even stolen?&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa's speech seemed to have brought a certain conviction 
into the heart of Van Systens, and he was going to answer 
her in a gentler tone, when at once a great noise was heard 
in the street, and loud cheers shook the house.</P>
<P>&quot;What is this?&quot; cried the burgomaster; &quot;what is this? Is it 
possible? have I heard aright?&quot;</P>
<P>And he rushed towards his anteroom, without any longer 
heeding Rosa, whom he left in his cabinet.</P>
<P>Scarcely had he reached his anteroom when he cried out aloud 
on seeing his staircase invaded, up to the very 
landing-place, by the multitude, which was accompanying, or 
rather following, a young man, simply clad in a 
violet-coloured velvet, embroidered with silver; who, with a 
certain aristocratic slowness, ascended the white stone 
steps of the house.</P>
<P>In his wake followed two officers, one of the navy, and the 
other of the cavalry.</P>
<P>Van Systens, having found his way through the frightened 
domestics, began to bow, almost to prostrate himself before 
his visitor, who had been the cause of all this stir.</P>
<P>&quot;Monseigneur,&quot; he called out, &quot;Monseigneur! What 
distinguished honour is your Highness bestowing for ever on 
my humble house by your visit?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Dear Mynheer van Systens,&quot; said William of Orange, with a 
serenity which, with him, took the place of a smile, &quot;I am a 
true Hollander, I am fond of the water, of beer, and of 
flowers, sometimes even of that cheese the flavour of which 
seems so grateful to the French; the flower which I prefer 
to all others is, of course, the tulip. I heard at Leyden 
that the city of Haarlem at last possessed the black tulip; 
and, after having satisfied myself of the truth of news 
which seemed so incredible, I have come to know all about it 
from the President of the Horticultural Society.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Monseigneur, Monseigneur!&quot; said Van Systens, &quot;what 
glory to the society if its endeavours are pleasing to your 
Highness!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you got the flower here?&quot; said the Prince, who, very 
likely, already regretted having made such a long speech.</P>
<P>&quot;I am sorry to say we have not.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And where is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;With its owner.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who is he?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;An honest tulip-grower of Dort.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;His name?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Boxtel.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;His quarters?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At the White Swan; I shall send for him, and if in the 
meanwhile your Highness will do me the honour of stepping 
into my drawing-room, he will be sure  -  knowing that your 
Highness is here  -  to lose no time in bringing his tulip.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, send for him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, your Highness, but  -  - </P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, nothing of any consequence, Monseigneur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Everything is of consequence, Mynheer van Systens.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, Monseigneur, if it must be said, a little 
difficulty has presented itself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What difficulty?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This tulip has already been claimed by usurpers. It's true 
that it is worth a hundred thousand guilders.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Monseigneur, by usurpers, by forgers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This is a crime, Mynheer van Systens.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So it is, your Highness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And have you any proofs of their guilt? '</P>
<P>&quot;No, Monseigneur, the guilty woman  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The guilty woman, Sir?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I ought to say, the woman who claims the tulip, 
Monseigneur, is here in the room close by.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what do you think of her?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think, Monseigneur, that the bait of a hundred thousand 
guilders may have tempted her.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And so she claims the tulip?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes Monseigneur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what proof does she offer?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I was just going to question her when your Highness came 
in.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Question her, Mynheer van Systens, question her. I am the 
first magistrate of the country; I will hear the case and 
administer justice.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have found my King Solomon,&quot; said Van Systens, bowing, 
and showing the way to the Prince.</P>
<P>His Highness was just going to walk ahead, but, suddenly 
recollecting himself he said  - </P>
<P>&quot;Go before me, and call me plain Mynheer.&quot;</P>
<P>The two then entered the cabinet.</P>
<P>Rosa was still standing at the same place, leaning on the 
window, and looking through the panes into the garden.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! a Frisian girl,&quot; said the Prince, as he observed Rosa's 
gold brocade headdress and red petticoat.</P>
<P>At the noise of their footsteps she turned round, but 
scarcely saw the Prince, who seated himself in the darkest 
corner of the apartment.</P>
<P>All her attention, as may be easily imagined, was fixed on 
that important person who was called Van Systens, so that 
she had no time to notice the humble stranger who was 
following the master of the house, and who, for aught she 
knew, might be somebody or nobody.</P>
<P>The humble stranger took a book down from the shelf, and 
made Van Systens a sign to commence the examination 
forthwith.</P>
<P>Van Systens, likewise at the invitation of the young man in 
the violet coat, sat down in his turn, and, quite happy and 
proud of the importance thus cast upon him, began,  - </P>
<P>&quot;My child, you promise to tell me the truth and the entire 
truth concerning this tulip?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I promise.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, speak before this gentleman; this gentleman is 
one of the members of the Horticultural Society.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What am I to tell you, sir,&quot; said Rosa, &quot;beside that which 
I have told you already.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, what is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I repeat the question I have addressed to you before.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Which?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That you will order Mynheer Boxtel to come here with his 
tulip. If I do not recognise it as mine I will frankly tell 
it; but if I do recognise it I will reclaim it, even if I go 
before his Highness the Stadtholder himself, with my proofs 
in my hands.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You have, then, some proofs, my child?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;God, who knows my good right, will assist me to some.&quot;</P>
<P>Van Systens exchanged a look with the Prince, who, since the 
first words of Rosa, seemed to try to remember her, as if it 
were not for the first time that this sweet voice rang in 
his ears.</P>
<P>An officer went off to fetch Boxtel, and Van Systens in the 
meanwhile continued his examination.</P>
<P>&quot;And with what do you support your assertion that you are 
the real owner of the black tulip?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;With the very simple fact of my having planted and grown it 
in my own chamber.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In your chamber? Where was your chamber?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At Loewestein.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are from Loewestein?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am the daughter of the jailer of the fortress.&quot;</P>
<P>The Prince made a little movement, as much as to say, &quot;Well, 
that's it, I remember now.&quot;</P>
<P>And, all the while feigning to be engaged with his book, he 
watched Rosa with even more attention than he had before.</P>
<P>&quot;And you are fond of flowers?&quot; continued Mynheer van 
Systens.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then you are an experienced florist, I dare say?&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa hesitated a moment; then with a tone which came from 
the depth of her heart, she said,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen, I am speaking to men of honor.&quot;</P>
<P>There was such an expression of truth in the tone of her 
voice, that Van Systens and the Prince answered 
simultaneously by an affirmative movement of their heads.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, I am not an experienced florist; I am only a 
poor girl, one of the people, who, three months ago, knew 
neither how to read nor how to write. No, the black tulip 
has not been found by myself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But by whom else?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;By a poor prisoner of Loewestein.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;By a prisoner of Loewestein?&quot; repeated the Prince.</P>
<P>The tone of his voice startled Rosa, who was sure she had 
heard it before.</P>
<P>&quot;By a prisoner of state, then,&quot; continued the Prince, &quot;as 
there are none else there.&quot;</P>
<P>Having said this he began to read again, at least in 
appearance.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Rosa, with a faltering voice, &quot;yes, by a 
prisoner of state.&quot;</P>
<P>Van Systens trembled as he heard such a confession made in 
the presence of such a witness.</P>
<P>&quot;Continue,&quot; said William dryly, to the President of the 
Horticultural Society.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, sir,&quot; said Rosa, addressing the person whom she thought 
to be her real judge, &quot;I am going to incriminate myself very 
seriously.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Van Systens, &quot;the prisoner of state ought 
to be kept in close confinement at Loewestein.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alas! sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And from what you tell me you took advantage of your 
position, as daughter of the jailer, to communicate with a 
prisoner of state about the cultivation of flowers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So it is, sir,&quot; Rosa murmured in dismay; &quot;yes, I am bound 
to confess, I saw him every day.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Unfortunate girl!&quot; exclaimed Van Systens.</P>
<P>The Prince, observing the fright of Rosa and the pallor of 
the President, raised his head, and said, in his clear and 
decided tone,  - </P>
<P>&quot;This cannot signify anything to the members of the 
Horticultural Society; they have to judge on the black 
tulip, and have no cognizance to take of political offences. 
Go on, young woman, go on.&quot;</P>
<P>Van Systens, by means of an eloquent glance, offered, in the 
name of the tulip, his thanks to the new member of the 
Horticultural Society.</P>
<P>Rosa, reassured by this sort of encouragement which the 
stranger was giving her, related all that had happened for 
the last three months, all that she had done, and all that 
she had suffered. She described the cruelty of Gryphus; the 
destruction of the first bulb; the grief of the prisoner; 
the precautions taken to insure the success of the second 
bulb; the patience of the prisoner and his anxiety during 
their separation; how he was about to starve himself because 
he had no longer any news of his tulip; his joy when she 
went to see him again; and, lastly, their despair when they 
found that the tulip which had come into flower was stolen 
just one hour after it had opened.</P>
<P>All this was detailed with an accent of truth which, 
although producing no change in the impassible mien of the 
Prince, did not fail to take effect on Van Systens.</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; said the Prince, &quot;it cannot be long since you knew 
the prisoner.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa opened her large eyes and looked at the stranger, who 
drew back into the dark corner, as if he wished to escape 
her observation.</P>
<P>&quot;Why, sir?&quot; she asked him.</P>
<P>&quot;Because it is not yet four months since the jailer Gryphus 
and his daughter were removed to Loewestein.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is true, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Otherwise, you must have solicited the transfer of your 
father, in order to be able to follow some prisoner who may 
have been transported from the Hague to Loewestein.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sir,&quot; said Rosa, blushing.</P>
<P>&quot;Finish what you have to say,&quot; said William.</P>
<P>&quot;I confess I knew the prisoner at the Hague.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Happy prisoner!&quot; said William, smiling.</P>
<P>At this moment the officer who had been sent for Boxtel 
returned, and announced to the Prince that the person whom 
he had been to fetch was following on his heels with his tulip. </P></div>
