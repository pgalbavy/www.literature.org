<p>The next day, at the same hour, Uncle Jerry Chuck went to the big
rock. This time he was looking forward to even a longer nap in the
sun than he had had the day before. If Billy Woodchuck was willing
to listen, without pay, Uncle Jerry was more than willing to let
him.
</p>
<p>Billy Woodchuck was somewhat late. But he arrived at last.
</p><p>"You must be more prompt," Uncle Jerry told him, severely. "I have
no time to waste waiting for a young chap like you. When I'm good
enough to let you do my listening, it seems to me you ought to be
on time," he grumbled. That is often the way with people who get
things for nothing. They are very likely to find fault.
</p><p>Now, Billy Woodchuck had been doing some thinking since the day
before. And while Uncle Jerry was hunting for a soft spot on the
big rock, where he could lie, Billy suddenly surprised him by
saying:
</p><p>"Don't you think you ought to pay me for listening for you, Uncle
Jerry?"
</p><p>Uncle Jerry grunted. He was not at all pleased.
</p><p>"This is not a good time to speak of <u>pay</u>," he said. "I am so
sleepy that I can hardly keep my eyes open. However, I'll see what
I can do for you--after I've had my nap."
</p><p>And then he fell asleep, and snored ever so much louder than he had
the previous day. He slept longer, too. And by the time he
awakened, Billy Woodchuck was quite worn out, and ready to fall
asleep himself.
</p><p>This time Uncle Jerry did not wait to stretch himself. As soon as
he opened his eyes he leapt to his feet and started off.
</p><p>"Meet me here to-morrow at the same hour," he ordered.
</p><p>"But you haven't paid me for to-day!" Billy Woodchuck cried.
</p><p>Uncle Jerry stopped.
</p><p>"I declare, I'd forgotten all about that," he said. "I'll tell you
what I'll do.... You know, turn about is fair play. So if you want
to take a nap, you can lie right down here and take it. And I'll do
more for you than you did for me. I'll keep track of the time. And
when the sun gets over the big elm by the brook, I'll wake you up."
</p><p>Billy Woodchuck agreed. And as soon as he was fast asleep Uncle
Jerry left him. You see, old Uncle Jerry Chuck was a sly old
gentleman. He had said nothing at all about listening for danger.
</p><p>So Billy Woodchuck slept on.
</p><p>If the Great Horned Owl had happened along then, he could have
caught Billy without any trouble.
</p><p>But it was not Mr. Owl who passed that way, before the sun climbed
above the big elm. Though some one did spy Billy, as he lay there
sleeping.
</p><p>Who do you suppose it was?
