<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>IT had been snowing hard for twenty-four hours at Dead Man's
Gulch. Beginning with a few feathery particles, they had steadily
increased in number until the biting air was filled with billions
of snowflakes, which whirled and eddied in the gale that howled
through the gorges and cañons of the Sierras. It was still snowing
with no sign of cessation, and the blizzard blanketed the earth
to the depth of several feet, filling up the treacherous hollows,
caverns and abysses and making travel almost impossible for man
or animal.</p>

<p>The shanties of the miners in Dead Man's Gulch were just eleven
in number. They were strung along the eastern side of the gorge
and at an altitude of two or three hundred feet from the bed of
the pass or cañon. The site protruded in the form of a table-land,
offering a secure foundation for the structures, which were thus
elevated sufficiently to be beyond reach of the terrific torrents
that sometimes rushed through the ravine during the melting of
the snow in the spring, or after one of those fierce cloud-bursts
that give scarcely a minute's warning of their coming.</p>

<p>The diggings were in the mountain side at varying distances.
The success in mining had been only moderate, although several
promising finds raised hopes. The population numbered precisely
thirty men, representing all quarters of the Union, while five
came from Europe. The majority were shaggy, bronzed adventurers,
the variety being almost as great as the numbers. Some had been
clerks, several were college graduates, a number were the sons
of wealthy parents, and one was a full-fledged parson, while there
was a certain percentage who had left their homes to escape the
grip of the offended law.</p>

<p>With that yearning for picturesqueness which is a peculiar trait
of Americans, the miners felt that when their settlement had attained
the dignity of nearly a dozen dwellings, it was entitled to an
appropriate name. The gorge, which seemed to have been gouged
out of the solid mass of boulders and rocks, when the mountains
were split apart in the remote past, was known from the first
by the title already given, which also clung to the diggings themselves.</p>

<p>The single saloon presided over by Max Ortigies, was the Heavenly
Bower,&mdash;so <em>that</em> point was settled, but when it came to
naming the settlement itself, the difficulties were so numerous
that days and weeks passed without an agreement being reached.
No matter how striking and expressive the title offered by one
man, the majority promptly protested. It was too sulphurous, or
too insipid or it lacked in that nebulous characteristic which
may be defined as true Americanism. It looked as if the problem
would never be solved, when Landlord Ortigies, taking the bull
by the horns, appointed a committee of three to select a name,
the others pledging themselves to accept whatever the committee
submitted.</p>

<p>But the mischief was to pay when on the night of the blizzard
the committee met at the Heavenly Bower to make their report.
The chairman insisted upon "E Pluribus Unum," the second member's
favorite was "Murderer's Holler," while the third would not listen
to anything except "Wolf Eye," and each was immovably set in his
convictions.</p>

<p>Budge Isham was not a member of the committee, but he was known
as a college graduate. From his seat on an overturned box at the
rear of the room, where he was smoking a pipe, he asked troublesome
questions and succeeded in arraying the committeemen so fiercely
against one another that each was eager to vote, in the event
of failing to carry his own point, in favor of any name objectionable
to the rest.</p>

<p>The chairman as stated favored the patriotic name "E Pluribus
Unum," and boldly announced the fact.</p>

<p>"It has a lofty sound," blandly remarked Isham; "will the chairman
be good enough to translate it for us? In other words, what does
'E Pluribus Unum' mean?"</p>

<p>"Why," replied the chairman with scorn in his manner; "everybody
oughter know it means, 'Hurrah for the red, white and blue.'"</p>

<p>"Thank you," returned Isham, puffing at his pipe.</p>

<p>Vose Adams, the second committeeman, felt it his duty to explain
his position.</p>

<p>"The trouble with that outlandish name is in the fust place that
it has three words and consequently it's too much to manage. Whoever
heard of a town with three handles to its name? Then it's foreign.
When I was in college (several disrespectful sniffs which caused
the speaker to stop and glare around in quest of the offenders);
I say when I was in college and studying Greek and Chinese and
Russian, I larned that that name was made up of all three of them
languages. I b'leve in America for the Americans, and if we can't
find a name that's in the American language, why let's wait till
we can."</p>

<p>This sentiment was delivered with such dramatic force that several
of the miners nodded their heads in approval. It was an appeal
to the patriotic side of their nature&mdash;which was quick to respond.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman," said Budge Isham, addressing the landlord, who,
by general consent, was the presiding officer at these disputations,
and who like the others failed to see the quiet amusement the
educated man was extracting, "if it is agreeable to Mr. Adams,
to whose eloquent speech we have listened with much edification,
I would like him to give us his reasons for calling our handsome
town 'Murderers' Hollow.'"</p>

<p>The gentleman appealed to rose to his feet. Turning toward the
man who had called upon him, he gave him a look which ought to
have made him sink to the floor with mortification, preliminary
to saying with polished irony:</p>

<p>"If the gentleman had paid attention as he oughter, he would
have obsarved that I said 'Murderer's Holler,' not 'Murderers'
<em>Hollow</em>.' I would advise him not to forget that he ain't
the only man in this place that has received a college eddycation.
Now as to the name: it proclaims our stern virtue and love for
law."</p>

<p>The orator paused, but the wondering expression of the bronzed
faces turned toward him showed that he would have to descend to
particulars.</p>

<p>"When violators of the law hear that name, what does it say to
them? It says that if any murderer shows his face in this place,
he will receive such rough handling that he will have to holler
'enough,' and will be glad to get out &mdash;I don't see what
there is to laugh at!" exclaimed Vose angrily, looking threateningly
around again with his fists clenched and his gaze fixed specially
upon the grinning Budge Isham.</p>

<p>"There's some sense in what Vose says, which ain't often the
case," remarked Ike Hoe, the other member of the committee, "but
the trouble will be that when folks hear of the name, they won't
think to give it the meanin' that he gives it. They'll conclude
that this place is the home of murderers, and, if it keeps on,
bime by of hoss thieves. If it warn't for that danger, I might
go in for backing up Vose with his name, but as it stands it won't
do."</p>

<p>The argument of Ike had produced its effect. There was little
sympathy in the first place for the title, and that little was
destroyed by the words of Ike, who proceeded to plead for his
own choice.</p>

<p>"Now as to 'Wolf Eye.' In the first place, it is short and easy
to say. There ain't any slur in the name, that might offend a
new comer, who would think the 'Murderer's Holler' contained ungentlemanly
allusions to his past. It is warning, too, that the place has
got an eye on everybody and has teeth as sharp as a wolf. Then
there is poetry in the name. Gentlemen," added Ike in a burst
of enthusiasm, "we oughter go in for poetry. How can any one live
in such a glorious country as this with the towering kenyons around
him, with the mountains thousands of feet deep, with the grand
sun kissin' the western tips in the morning and sinking to rest
at night in the east,&mdash;with the snow storms in summer and the
blazing heat in winter&mdash;with the glo&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Hold on! hold on!" called Budge Isham, rising solemnly to his
feet, with hands uplifted in protest; "if Ike doesn't stop, he'll
have us all standing on our heads. There's a brand of liquor down
in Sacramento called 'Wolf Eye;' I don't make any charges, gentlemen,
against my friend Ike, but you can draw your inferences. Wolf
Eye won't do."</p>

<p>A general laugh greeted this sally, seeing which the indignant
Ike turned the tables upon Budge with an admirable piece of sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Seeing as how all of us together don't know 'nough to git up
a name that will suit, I move that the college eddycated gentleman
supplies the brains and does it himself."</p>

<p>The crushing irony of this remark was spoiled by Budge accepting
it in all seriousness. He bowed his head and gracefully thanked
the satirical Vose.</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to do so. The committee meant well enough,
but the trouble was that there were too many fools on it&#11834;"</p>

<p>At this point Wade Ruggles sprang to his feet, with the fierce
question:</p>

<p>"Does the gentleman refer to <em>me</em>?"</p>

<p>His hand was at his hip on the butt of his revolver and matters
looked squally, but the tactful Budge quelled the rising storm
with Chesterfieldian grace. Waving his hand and bowing, he said:</p>

<p>"I did not intend the remotest reference to you."</p>

<p>Vose Adams came up promptly.</p>

<p>"Then it's <em>me</em> and I'm ready to make any man eat his
words."</p>

<p>"My good friend is mistaken; nothing could induce me to apply
such a term to him; I hold him in too high esteem."</p>

<p>Since this left Ike Hoe as the only remaining member, he began
to show signs of explosion, perceiving which the incomprehensible
Budge proceeded to mollify him.</p>

<p>"And Ike knows that I would be the last person in the world to
slur a gentleman from whom I as well as the others have received
so much instruction."</p>

<p>Ike was mystified. He looked at the other members of the committee
and then into the faces of the group. He couldn't make it out.</p>

<p>"If it's all the same, Mr. Chairman, since the gentleman has
said there was too many fools on the committee, and has just explained
that he didn't mean any one of us three, I'll be obliged if he'll
explain who in thunder he did mean."</p>

<p>This sounded unanswerable, but the cunning Budge was equal to
the occasion.</p>

<p>"It gives me pleasure to answer the question of the gentleman:
my remark was made in a Pickwickian sense."</p>

<p>He leaned forward with a beaming smile, as if his explanation
left nothing to be added. No one understood to what he referred,
but all were too proud to admit the fact. There was a general
nodding of heads, and Ike, with the manner of a man who magnanimously
accepts the humble apology of him whom he has worsted, leaned
back on his stool and audibly remarked:</p>

<p>"That makes it all right."</p>

<p>Budge Isham resumed his seat, when he was reminded that he was
expected to submit a name for the new settlement.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," he said, rising again, "it is a fact known to
this highly intelligent assemblage, that every city of prominence
in Europe has from one to forty namesakes in this country. There
is one exception, however; doubtless all know to what city I refer."</p>

<p>In response to his inquiring looks, the group tried to appear
as if the name was familiar to them, but no one spoke.</p>

<p>"It is hardly necessary for me to mention the city, but I may
say it is Constantinople."</p>

<p>A contemptuous sniff greeted this proposal.</p>

<p>"That's the worst yet," said Wade Ruggles, drawing a match along
the thigh of his trousers to relight his pipe, which had gone
out during the excitement; "the man that insults this party with
such a proposition, ought to be run out of the place."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it?" demanded Budge.</p>

<p>"It's too long in the fust place," commented Ike Hoe; "it bothers
a man to git his mouth around it and it hain't any music, like
the other names such as Starvation Kenyon, Hangman's Noose, Blizzard
Gorge and the rest. I stick to mine as the purtiest of all."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"'Blazes,' short and sweet and innercent like."</p>

<p>Landlord Ortigies was leaning with both elbows on the bar. The
new name struck him favorably.</p>

<p>"I'm inclined to agree with Budge," he said, "cause there hain't
any other place that's hit onto it. All of them names that you
chaps have tried to spring onto us, have been used in other places,
or at least some part of the names, but, as Budge has observed,
no galoot has scooped 'Constantinople.'"</p>

<p>"'Cause no one ain't fool enough," observed Ike Hoe, who noted
the drift of the sentiment.</p>

<p>"But they'll pounce onto it powerful quick if we don't grab it
while it's passin'; it's a good long name, and what if it does
make a chap sling the muscles of his jaw to warble it? All the
better; it'll make him think well of his town, which I prophesy
is going to be the emporium of the West."</p>

<p>"Let's see," growled Wade Ruggles, "Constantinople is in Ireland
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Where's your eddycation?" sneered Ike Vose; "it's the oldest
town in Wales."</p>

<p>Landlord Ortigies raised his head and filled the room with his
genial laughter.</p>

<p>"If there was anything I was strong on when I led my class at
the Squankum High School it was astronermy; I was never catched
in locating places."</p>

<p>"If you know so much," remarked Ruggles, "you'll let us know
something 'bout that town which I scorn to name."</p>

<p>"I'm allers ready to enlighten ign'rance, though I've never visited
Constantinople, which stands on the top of the Himalaya Mountains,
in the southern part of Iceland."</p>

<p>"That's very good," said Budge Isham, who with his usual tact
maneuvered to keep the ally he had gained, "but the Constantinople
I have in mind is in Turkey, which is such a goodly sized country
that it straddles from Europe to Asia."</p>

<p>"Which the same I suppose means to imply that this ere Constantinople
will do likewise similar."</p>

<p>"No doubt that's what it'll do in time," assented the landlord.</p>

<p>"I beg to offer an amendment to my own motion," continued the
oily Budge; "when the boom strikes this town, as it is bound soon
to do, and it rivals in size the famous city on the other side
of the Atlantic, there should be something to distinguish the
two. We have no wish to rob any other place of the honors it has
taken centuries to gain; so, while we reserve the principal name,
I propose that we distinguish it from the old city by prefixing
the word 'New.'"</p>

<p>"You mean that this town shall be 'New Constantinople?'" was
the inquiring remark of the landlord.</p>

<p>"Precisely; and I now make the motion that that be our name."</p>

<p>There were seventeen persons present and it looked as if a decision
was inevitable. The landlord was shrewd. His first act was to
invite all to drink at his expense, after which he made each pledge
himself to abide by the decision, whatever it might be. These
preliminaries being arranged, a show of hands was called for.
The vote was eight for and eight against the new name.</p>

<p>"That's a tie," commented the landlord from behind his immense
beard; "and therefore the question ain't settled."</p>

<p>"It's easy 'nough to settle it," said Ike Hoe.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Take another vote."</p>

<p>"I don't see how that'll do it, onless some one changes his mind;
but again, gentlemen: all who favor the new name, raise their
right hands."</p>

<p>Eight horny palms were elevated in air, while the same number
were displayed in the negative. The landlord looked troubled.</p>

<p>"We must keep it up till some one weakens," observed Wade Ruggles.</p>

<p>The host scanned the earnest faces in front of him.</p>

<p>"Which of you gentlemen will promise to weaken if we keep this
thing up for half the night?"</p>

<p>"I'll stay here a week," was the reply of Vose Adams, while the
general nodding of heads showed that he echoed the sentiments
of the others. The landlord met the crisis with becoming dignity.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, when I was a member of Congress, all questions that
was tied was settled by the presiding officer casting the deciding
vote, and which as aforesaid we don't lay any claim to being higher
than Congress, I therefore, by virtue of the aforesaid right vested
in me, cast my vote in favor of this city being called New Constantinople,
which the same is on me again; gentlemen, what will you have?"</p>

<p>It was a coup d'etat, the victory being clinched before the opposition
realized it. Ere the company had fairly recovered from their bewilderment,
Budge Isham declared that the victory was really his, due to the
good sense and high toned chivalry of his friends, and he insisted
upon doing the honors. He would accept no denial and the engaging
style in which he acquitted himself of this duty restored good
humor. Thus it was that the little mining town of the Sierras
in the days that are gone received its title.</p>

<p>The Heavenly Bower consisted of two large apartments, both on
the ground floor. The one at the rear was used by Landlord Ortigies
for sleeping, eating and partial storage purposes. When Vose Adams
made his quarterly visits to Sacramento, he was accompanied by
two mules. They were not necessary to take and bring the mail,
since the pocket of Adams' great coat was sufficient for that,
but they carried down to Sacramento several empty casks which
came back filled, or rather they were thus when the return journey
was begun, but to the dismay of the proprietor of the Heavenly
Bower, he found that they were barely two-thirds full, when unloaded
at his place. Vose explained that the leakage was due to the roughness
of the trail. Since there seemed no other way of overcoming this,
the landlord sent an extra cask with the request to Vose that
he would confine his leakage to that and Vose kindly obliged him.</p>

<p>The stuff thus provided for the Heavenly Bower was generally
in concentrated form, thereby permitting a dilution which insured
a full supply for the customers who were afflicted with an eternal
thirst.</p>

<p>The bar room was of extensive proportions. Nearly all of one
side was occupied by the bar. Opposite was the huge fireplace,
and scattered around were a number of stools, rickety chairs and
strong boxes which served equally well for seats.</p>

<p>The crackling fire, the genial warmth and good cheer within the
room were the more striking because of their contrast with the
howling storm without. The gale roared around the corners of the
rude but strong structure, rattling against the massive door and
the log walls, spitting vicious gusts down the chimney and flinging
great drifts hither and yon with a fury that threatened to send
the building skurrying through the snowy space.</p>

<p>"It's the worst blizzard we ever had," remarked Wade Ruggles,
after one of these violent outbursts; "God pity any one that's
abroad to-night."</p>

<p>"It reminds me of that zephyr last winter," observed Vose Adams,
"when I was bringing your freight, Max, from Sacramento."</p>

<p>"I remember," nodded the landlord; "you started with two kegs
and got here with about half a one; the leakage was tremenjus
on that trip."</p>

<p>"True; the blizzards is always rough on Mountain Dew, and sorter
makes it shrink," replied the unblushing Vose.</p>

<p>"Can't you stop the casks leaking so much," inquired Felix Brush,
who had been a parson in Missouri, and claimed that he had never
been "unfrocked."</p>

<p>The landlord solemnly swayed his head.</p>

<p>"Not as long as Vose has charge of the freight&#11834;"</p>

<p>At that instant a dull but resounding thump was heard on the
roof overhead. It shook every log in the structure, checked speech
and caused each man to look wonderingly at his neighbor.</p>

<p>"The mountain has fell on us!" exclaimed Ike Hoe in a husky whisper.</p>

<p>"If it was the mountain," said Budge Isham, slightly raising
his voice, as the courage of the party came back; "none of us
would be able to tell of it."</p>

<p>"Then it's a rock&mdash;well, I'm blessed! the thing is moving!"</p>

<p>Something was certainly astir in the mass of snow overhead.</p>

<p>"I guess it's a angel that has lost its way," submitted Hoe.</p>

<p>"More likely it's a grizzly b'ar that's stumbled off the rocks&mdash;"</p>

<p>But all these speculations were scattered to the winds by the
sound of a voice muffled and seemingly far away, which came to
them through the storm:</p>

<p>"<em>Helloa, the house</em>!"</p>
