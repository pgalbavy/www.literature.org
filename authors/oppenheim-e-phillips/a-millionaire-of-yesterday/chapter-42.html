With the darkness had come a wind from the sea, and the boy crept
outside in his flannels and planter's hat and threw himself down in
a cane chair with a little murmur of relief.  Below him burned the
white lights of the town, a little noisier than usual to-night, for
out in the bay a steamer was lying-to, and there had been a few
passengers and cargo to land.  The boy had had a hard day's work,
or he would have been in the town himself to watch for arrivals and
wait for the mail.  He closed his eyes, half asleep, for the sun
had been hot and the murmurs of the sea below was almost like a
lullaby.  As he lay there a man's voice from the path reached him.
He sprang up, listening intently.  It must have been fancy - and
yet!  He leaned over the wooden balcony.  The figure of a man
loomed out through the darkness, came nearer, became distinct.  Fred
recognised him with a glad shout.
<P>
"Trent!" he cried.  "Scarlett Trent, by all that's amazing!"
<P>
Trent held out his hand quickly.  Somehow the glad young voice,
quivering with excitement, touched his heart in an unexpected and
unusual manner.  It was pleasant to be welcomed like this - to feel
that one person in the world at least was glad of his coming.  For
Trent was a sorely stricken man and the flavour of life had gone
from him.  Many a time he had looked over the steamer's side during
that long, lonely voyage and gazed almost wishfully into the sea,
in whose embrace was rest.  It seemed to him that he had been a
gambler playing for great stakes, and the turn of the wheel had
gone against him.
<P>
"Fred!"
<P>
They stood with hands locked together, the boy breathless with
surprise.  Then he saw that something was wrong.
<P>
"What is it, Trent?" he asked quickly.  "Have we gone smash after
all, or have you been ill?"
<P>
Trent shook his head and smiled gravely.
<P>
"Neither," he said.  "The Company is booming, I believe.  Civilised
ways didn't agree with me, I'm afraid.  That's all!  I've come back
to have a month or two's hard work - the best physic in the world."
<P>
"I am delighted to see you," Fred said heartily.  "Everything's going
A1 here, and they've built me this little bungalow, only got in it
last week - stunning, isn't it?  But - just fancy your being here
again so soon!  Are your traps coming up?"
<P>
"I haven't many," Trent answered.  "They're on the way.  Have you
got room for me?"
<P>
"Room for you!" the boy repeated scornfully.  "Why, I'm all alone
here.  It's the only thing against the place, being a bit lonely.
Room for you!  I should think there is!  Here, Dick!  Dinner at
once, and some wine!"
<P>
Trent was taken to see his room, the boy talking all the time, and
later on dinner was served and the boy did the honours, chaffing
and talking lightly.  But later on when they sat outside, smoking
furiously to keep off the mosquitoes and watching the fireflies dart
in and out amongst the trees, the boy was silent.  Then he leaned
over and laid his hand on Trent's arm.
<P>
"Tell me all about it - do," he begged.
<P>
Trent was startled, touched, and suddenly filled with a desire for
sympathy such as he had never before in his life experienced.  He
hesitated, but it was only for a moment.
<P>
"I never thought to tell any one," he said slowly, "I think I'd
like to!"
<P>
And he did.  He told his whole story.  He did not spare himself.
He spoke of the days of his earlier partnership with Monty, and he
admitted the apparent brutality of his treatment of him on more
than one occasion.  He spoke of Ernestine too - of his strange fancy
for the photograph of Monty's little girl, a fancy which later on
when he met her became almost immediately the dominant passion of
his life.  Then he spoke of the coming of Francis, of the awakening
of Ernestine's suspicions, and of that desperate moment when he
risked everything on her faith in him - and lost.  There was little
else to tell and afterwards there was a silence.  But presently the
boy's hand fell upon his arm almost caressingly and he leaned over
through the darkness.
<P>
"Women are such idiots," the boy declared, with all the vigour and
certainty of long experience.  "If only Aunt Ernestine had known
you half as well as I do, she would have been quite content to have
trusted you and to have believed that what you did was for the best.
But I say, Trent, you ought to have waited for it.  After she had
seen her father and talked with him she must have understood you
better.  I shall write to her."
<P>
But Trent shook his head.
<P>
"No," he said sternly, "it is too late now.  That moment taught me
all I wanted to know.  It was her love I wanted, Fred, and - that
 - no use hoping for that, or she would have trusted me.  After all
I was half a madman ever to have expected it - a rough, coarse chap
like me, with only a smattering of polite ways!  It was madness!
Some day I shall get over it!  We'll chuck work for a bit, soon,
Fred, and go for some lions.  That'll give us something to think
about at any rate."
<P>
<P>
<P>
But the lions which Trent might have shot lived in peace, for on
the morrow he was restless and ill, and within a week the deadly
fever of the place had him in its clutches.  The boy nursed him
and the German doctor came up from Attra and, when he learnt who
his patient was, took up his quarters in the place.  But for all
his care and the boy's nursing things went badly with Scarlett
Trent.
<P>
To him ended for a while all measure of days - time became one long
night, full of strange, tormenting flashes of thought, passing like
red fire before his burning eyes.  Sometimes it was Monty crying to
him from the bush, sometimes the yelling of those savages at Bekwando
seemed to fill the air, sometimes Ernestine was there, listening to
his passionate pleading with cold, set face, In the dead of night he
saw her and the still silence was broken by his hoarse, passionate
cries, which they strove in vain to check.  And when at last he lay
white and still with exhaustion, the doctor looked at the boy and
softly shook his head.  He had very little hope.
<P>
Trent grew worse.  In those rare flashes of semi-consciousness which
sometimes come to the fever-stricken, he reckoned himself a dying
man and contemplated the end of all things without enthusiasm and
without regret.  The one and only failure of his life had eaten like
canker into his heart.  It was death he craved for in the hot,
burning nights, and death came and sat, a grisly shadow, at his
pillow.  The doctor and the boy did their best, but it was not they
who saved him.
<P>
There came a night when he raved, and the sound of a woman's name
rang out from the open windows of the little bungalow, rang out
through the drawn mosquito netting amongst the palm-trees, across
the surf-topped sea to the great steamer which lay in the bay.
Perhaps she heard it - perhaps after all it was a fancy.  Only, in
the midst of his fever, a hand as soft as velvet and as cool as the
night sea-wind touched his forehead, and a voice sounded in his ears
so sweetly that the blood burned no longer in his veins, so sweetly
that he lay back upon his pillow like a man under the influence of
a strong narcotic and slept.  Then the doctor smiled and the boy
sobbed.
<P>
"I came," she said softly, "because it was the only atonement I
could make.  I ought to have trusted you.  Do you know, even my
father told me that."
<P>
"I have made mistakes," he said, "and of course behaved badly to
him."
<P>
"Now that everything has been explained," she said, "I scarcely see
what else you could have done.  At least you saved him from Da Souza
when his death would have made you a freer man.  He is looking
forward to seeing you, you must make haste and get strong."
<P>
"For his sake," he murmured.
<P>
She leaned over and caressed him lightly.  "For mine, dear."
