<p><em>TO THE MALE TEACHER</em></p>

<p>It is your bounden duty to instruct your pupils in the laws of
health. If you fail to do so, you are not fit to be their teacher.</p>

<p>The vices of cigarette smoking, of tobacco chewing, of beer and
alcoholic drinking, threaten the very existence of the rising
generation. You cannot be too earnest and persistent in impressing
this truth upon the boys who look up to you for counsel.</p>

<p>You need not be reminded that the most powerful teacher is your
own example. Boys respect and admire manly vigor. You ought to
be able to outrun, outjump, outthrow, outswim, outwrestle, outspar,
and outplay, at all points, the largest and most active boy in
school. Many a teacher, when he attempts to take part in an athletic
game, becomes the laughing-stock of the youngest urchin, by reason
of his flabby awkwardness.</p>

<p>While our youth often need to be restrained rather than encouraged
to cultivate their muscles, yet they should be told to play when
the opportunity is theirs. You ought to take the lead in their
games. Your eye should be as bright, your sight as true, your
cheeks as rosy, your step as elastic and your physical prowess
the equal at least of any lad in school.</p>

<p>All the text-books in the land are less effective than a few
timely words from you. Occasions are continually presenting themselves
which should be utilized. When a boy has been playing too violently,
or when he neglects play, when he is careless as to his clothing
or shows evidence of falling into any bad habit, a kind but pointed
warning will accomplish more than weeks of study.</p>

<p>There are other dangers to which boys are peculiarly exposed,
and which obviously cannot be referred to in these pages, concerning
which it would be criminal for you to remain silent, but in all
such cases, your warning must be uttered to the offender in private,
or by the father to whom you may make the suggestion.</p>

<p>Of course you will see that the school-room is properly warmed
and ventilated; that the pupils are kept out of all drafts; and
that the air is as pure as possible. The faithful teacher will
find almost hourly opportunities for impressing these vital truths
upon the children, and, only by doing so to the fullest extent,
can he approach a proper fulfillment of his own mission as the
friend, counselor, and guide of the coming generations.</p>

<p><em>TO THE FEMALE TEACHER</em></p>

<p>What has been said to your co-laborer about assuming the lead
in observing the laws of health, applies with equal force to you.
Your experience and knowledge give you invaluable opportunities
for instructing the girls in what is truly the great question
of life and death.</p>

<p>Cleanliness, clothing, food, and all the subjects treated of
in the following pages, should be supplemented by the practical
illustrations which the girls themselves continually present.
No observant teacher can have failed to become acquainted with
the rudimentary laws of her being, and to none is given so golden
an opportunity to make that knowledge a living truth as to her
whose calling it is to instruct the future mothers of our country. </p>
