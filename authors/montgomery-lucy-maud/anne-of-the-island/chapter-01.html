"Harvest is ended and summer is gone," quoted Anne Shirley,
gazing across the shorn fields dreamily.  She and Diana Barry had
been picking apples in the Green Gables orchard, but were now
resting from their labors in a sunny corner, where airy fleets of
thistledown drifted by on the wings of a wind that was still
summer-sweet with the incense of ferns in the Haunted Wood.
<P>
But everything in the landscape around them spoke of autumn.
The sea was roaring hollowly in the distance, the fields were bare
and sere, scarfed with golden rod, the brook valley below Green
Gables overflowed with asters of ethereal purple, and the Lake of
Shining Waters was blue -- blue -- blue; not the changeful blue
of spring, nor the pale azure of summer, but a clear, steadfast,
serene blue, as if the water were past all moods and tenses of emotion
and had settled down to a tranquility unbroken by fickle dreams.
<P>
"It has been a nice summer," said Diana, twisting the new ring on
her left hand with a smile.  "And Miss Lavendar's wedding seemed
to come as a sort of crown to it.  I suppose Mr. and Mrs. Irving
are on the Pacific coast now."
<P>
"It seems to me they have been gone long enough to go around the world,"
sighed Anne.
<P>
"I can't believe it is only a week since they were married.
Everything has changed.  Miss Lavendar and Mr. and Mrs. Allan gone
-- how lonely the manse looks with the shutters all closed!
I went past it last night, and it made me feel as if everybody
in it had died."
<P>
"We'll never get another minister as nice as Mr. Allan," said Diana,
with gloomy conviction.  "I suppose we'll have all kinds of supplies
this winter, and half the Sundays no preaching at all.  And you and
Gilbert gone -- it will be awfully dull."
<P>
"Fred will be here," insinuated Anne slyly.
<P>
"When is Mrs. Lynde going to move up?" asked Diana, as if she
had not heard Anne's remark.
<P>
"Tomorrow.  I'm glad she's coming -- but it will be another change.
Marilla and I cleared everything out of the spare room yesterday.
Do you know, I hated to do it?  Of course, it was silly -- but
it did seem as if we were committing sacrilege.  That old spare
room has always seemed like a shrine to me.  When I was a child
I thought it the most wonderful apartment in the world.  You
remember what a consuming desire I had to sleep in a spare room bed
-- but not the Green Gables spare room.  Oh, no, never there!
It would have been too terrible -- I couldn't have slept a wink
from awe.  I never WALKED through that room when Marilla sent me in
on an errand -- no, indeed, I tiptoed through it and held my breath,
as if I were in church, and felt relieved when I got out of it.
The pictures of George Whitefield and the Duke of Wellington
hung there, one on each side of the mirror, and frowned so sternly
at me all the time I was in, especially if I dared peep in the mirror,
which was the only one in the house that didn't twist my face a little.
I always wondered how Marilla dared houseclean that room.  And now it's
not only cleaned but stripped bare.  George Whitefield and the Duke
have been relegated to the upstairs hall.  `So passes the glory of
this world,' " concluded Anne, with a laugh in which there was a
little note of regret.  It is never pleasant to have our old
shrines desecrated, even when we have outgrown them.
<P>
"I'll be so lonesome when you go," moaned Diana for the hundredth time.
"And to think you go next week!"
<P>
"But we're together still," said Anne cheerily.  "We mustn't let next
week rob us of this week's joy.  I hate the thought of going myself
-- home and I are such good friends.  Talk of being lonesome!
It's I who should groan.  YOU'LL be here with any number of your
old friends -- AND Fred!  While I shall be alone among strangers,
not knowing a soul!"
<P>
"EXCEPT Gilbert -- AND Charlie Sloane," said Diana, imitating
Anne's italics and slyness.
<P>
"Charlie Sloane will be a great comfort, of course," agreed Anne
sarcastically; whereupon both those irresponsible damsels laughed.
Diana knew exactly what Anne thought of Charlie Sloane; but,
despite sundry confidential talks, she did not know just what
Anne thought of Gilbert Blythe.  To be sure, Anne herself
did not know that.
<P>
"The boys may be boarding at the other end of Kingsport, for all
I know," Anne went on.  "I am glad I'm going to Redmond, and I am
sure I shall like it after a while.  But for the first few weeks
I know I won't.  I shan't even have the comfort of looking forward
to the weekend visit home, as I had when I went to Queen's.
Christmas will seem like a thousand years away."
<P>
"Everything is changing -- or going to change," said Diana sadly.
"I have a feeling that things will never be the same again, Anne."
<P>
"We have come to a parting of the ways, I suppose," said Anne
thoughtfully.  "We had to come to it.  Do you think, Diana, that
being grown-up is really as nice as we used to imagine it would
be when we were children?"
<P>
"I don't know -- there are SOME nice things about it," answered
Diana, again caressing her ring with that little smile which
always had the effect of making Anne feel suddenly left out and
inexperienced.  "But there are so many puzzling things, too.
Sometimes I feel as if being grown-up just frightened me -- and
then I would give anything to be a little girl again."
<P>
"I suppose we'll get used to being grownup in time," said Anne
cheerfully.  "There won't be so many unexpected things about it
by and by -- though, after all, I fancy it's the unexpected
things that give spice to life.  We're eighteen, Diana.  In two
more years we'll be twenty.  When I was ten I thought twenty was
a green old age.  In no time you'll be a staid, middle-aged
matron, and I shall be nice, old maid Aunt Anne, coming to visit
you on vacations.  You'll always keep a corner for me, won't you,
Di darling?  Not the spare room, of course -- old maids can't
aspire to spare rooms, and I shall be as 'umble as Uriah Heep,
and quite content with a little over-the-porch or off-the-parlor
cubby hole."
<P>
"What nonsense you do talk, Anne," laughed Diana.  "You'll marry
somebody splendid and handsome and rich -- and no spare room in
Avonlea will be half gorgeous enough for you -- and you'll turn
up your nose at all the friends of your youth."
<P>
"That would be a pity; my nose is quite nice, but I fear turning
it up would spoil it," said Anne, patting that shapely organ.
"I haven't so many good features that I could afford to spoil
those I have; so, even if I should marry the King of the Cannibal
Islands, I promise you I won't turn up my nose at you, Diana."
<P>
With another gay laugh the girls separated, Diana to return to
Orchard Slope, Anne to walk to the Post Office.  She found a
letter awaiting her there, and when Gilbert Blythe overtook her
on the bridge over the Lake of Shining Waters she was sparkling
with the excitement of it.
<P>
"Priscilla Grant is going to Redmond, too," she exclaimed.
"Isn't that splendid?  I hoped she would, but she didn't think
her father would consent.  He has, however, and we're to board
together.  I feel that I can face an army with banners -- or all
the professors of Redmond in one fell phalanx -- with a chum like
Priscilla by my side."
<P>
"I think we'll like Kingsport," said Gilbert.  "It's a nice old
burg, they tell me, and has the finest natural park in the world.
I've heard that the scenery in it is magnificent."
<P>
"I wonder if it will be -- can be -- any more beautiful than this,"
murmured Anne, looking around her with the loving, enraptured eyes
of those to whom "home" must always be the loveliest spot in the world,
no matter what fairer lands may lie under alien stars.
<P>
They were leaning on the bridge of the old pond, drinking deep of
the enchantment of the dusk, just at the spot where Anne had climbed
from her sinking Dory on the day Elaine floated down to Camelot.
The fine, empurpling dye of sunset still stained the western skies,
but the moon was rising and the water lay like a great, silver dream
in her light.  Remembrance wove a sweet and subtle spell over the
two young creatures.
<P>
"You are very quiet, Anne," said Gilbert at last.
<P>
"I'm afraid to speak or move for fear all this wonderful beauty
will vanish just like a broken silence," breathed Anne.
<P>
Gilbert suddenly laid his hand over the slender white one lying
on the rail of the bridge.  His hazel eyes deepened into darkness,
his still boyish lips opened to say something of the dream and hope
that thrilled his soul.  But Anne snatched her hand away and
turned quickly.  The spell of the dusk was broken for her.
<P>
"I must go home," she exclaimed, with a rather overdone carelessness.
"Marilla had a headache this afternoon, and I'm sure the twins will
be in some dreadful mischief by this time.  I really shouldn't have
stayed away so long."
<P>
She chattered ceaselessly and inconsequently until they reached
the Green Gables lane.  Poor Gilbert hardly had a chance to get
a  word in edgewise.  Anne felt rather relieved when they parted.
There had been a new, secret self-consciousness in her heart with
regard to Gilbert, ever since that fleeting moment of revelation
in the garden of Echo Lodge.  Something alien had intruded into
the old, perfect, school-day comradeship -- something that
threatened to mar it.
<P>
"I never felt glad to see Gilbert go before," she thought, half-
resentfully, half-sorrowfully, as she walked alone up the lane.
"Our friendship will be spoiled if he goes on with this nonsense.
It mustn't be spoiled -- I won't let it.  Oh, WHY can't boys be
just sensible!"
<P>
Anne had an uneasy doubt that it was not strictly "sensible" that
she should still feel on her hand the warm pressure of Gilbert's,
as distinctly as she had felt it for the swift second his had
rested there; and still less sensible that the sensation was far
from being an unpleasant one -- very different from that which
had attended a similar demonstration on Charlie Sloane's part,
when she had been sitting out a dance with him at a White Sands
party three nights before.  Anne shivered over the disagreeable
recollection.  But all problems connected with infatuated swains
vanished from her mind when she entered the homely, unsentimental
atmosphere of the Green Gables kitchen where an eight-year-old
boy was crying grievously on the sofa.
<P>
"What is the matter, Davy?" asked Anne, taking him up in her arms.
"Where are Marilla and Dora?"
<P>
"Marilla's putting Dora to bed," sobbed Davy, "and I'm crying
'cause Dora fell down the outside cellar steps, heels over head,
and scraped all the skin off her nose, and -- "
<P>
"Oh, well, don't cry about it, dear.  Of course, you are sorry
for her, but crying won't help her any.  She'll be all right
tomorrow.  Crying never helps any one, Davy-boy, and -- "
<P>
"I ain't crying 'cause Dora fell down cellar," said Davy, cutting
short Anne's wellmeant preachment with increasing bitterness.
"I'm crying, cause I wasn't there to see her fall.  I'm always
missing some fun or other, seems to me."
<P>
"Oh, Davy!" Anne choked back an unholy shriek of laughter.
"Would you call it fun to see poor little Dora fall down the
steps and get hurt?"
<P>
"She wasn't MUCH hurt," said Davy, defiantly.  "'Course, if
she'd been killed I'd have been real sorry, Anne.  But the Keiths
ain't so easy killed.  They're like the Blewetts, I guess.  Herb
Blewett fell off the hayloft last Wednesday, and rolled right
down through the turnip chute into the box stall, where they had
a fearful wild, cross horse, and rolled right under his heels.
And still he got out alive, with only three bones broke.  Mrs.
Lynde says there are some folks you can't kill with a meat-axe.
Is Mrs. Lynde coming here tomorrow, Anne?"
<P>
"Yes, Davy, and I hope you'll be always very nice and good to her."
<P>
"I'll be nice and good.  But will she ever put me to bed at nights, Anne?"
<P>
"Perhaps.  Why?"
<P>
"'Cause," said Davy very decidedly, "if she does I won't say my
prayers before her like I do before you, Anne."
<P>
"Why not?"
<P>
"'Cause I don't think it would be nice to talk to God before
strangers, Anne.  Dora can say hers to Mrs. Lynde if she likes,
but _I_ won't.  I'll wait till she's gone and then say 'em.  Won't
that be all right, Anne?"
<P>
"Yes, if you are sure you won't forget to say them, Davy-boy."
<P>
"Oh, I won't forget, you bet.  I think saying my prayers is great fun.
But it won't be as good fun saying them alone as saying them to you.
I wish you'd stay home, Anne.  I don't see what you want to go away
and leave us for."
<P>
"I don't exactly WANT to, Davy, but I feel I ought to go."
<P>
"If you don't want to go you needn't.  You're grown up.  When _I_'m
grown up I'm not going to do one single thing I don't want to do, Anne."
<P>
"All your life, Davy, you'll find yourself doing things you don't
want to do."
<P>
"I won't," said Davy flatly.  "Catch me!  I have to do things I
don't want to now 'cause you and Marilla'll send me to bed if I don't.
But when I grow up you can't do that, and there'll be nobody to tell me
not to do things.  Won't I have the time!  Say, Anne, Milty Boulter says
his mother says you're going to college to see if you can catch a man.
Are you, Anne?  I want to know."
<P>
For a second Anne burned with resentment.  Then she laughed,
reminding herself that Mrs. Boulter's crude vulgarity of thought
and speech could not harm her.
<P>
"No, Davy, I'm not.  I'm going to study and grow and learn about many things."
<P>
"What things?"
<P>
      "`Shoes and ships and sealing wax
      And cabbages and kings,'"
<P>
quoted Anne.
<P>
"But if you DID want to catch a man how would you go about it?
I want to know," persisted Davy, for whom the subject evidently
possessed a certain fascination.
<P>
"You'd better ask Mrs. Boulter," said Anne thoughtlessly.  "I
think it's likely she knows more about the process than I do."
<P>
"I will, the next time I see her," said Davy gravely.
<P>
"Davy!  If you do!" cried Anne, realizing her mistake.
<P>
"But you just told me to," protested Davy aggrieved.
<P>
"It's time you went to bed," decreed Anne, by way of getting out
of the scrape.
<P>
After Davy had gone to bed Anne wandered down to Victoria Island
and sat there alone, curtained with fine-spun, moonlit gloom,
while the water laughed around her in a duet of brook and wind.
Anne had always loved that brook.  Many a dream had she spun over
its sparkling water in days gone by.  She forgot lovelorn youths,
and the cayenne speeches of malicious neighbors, and all the
problems of her girlish existence.  In imagination she sailed
over storied seas that wash the distant shining shores of "faery
lands forlorn," where lost Atlantis and Elysium lie, with the
evening star for pilot, to the land of Heart's Desire.  And she
was richer in those dreams than in realities; for things seen
pass away, but the things that are unseen are eternal.
