<p>I was awakened shortly after daylight by a hubbub and stirring
in the street outside, and I lay in bed, listening, half asleep.
About six o'clock the Weasel opened my chamber door, saying that
Pittsburg was filling with refugees from the frontier, and that
a battalion of militia under Cresap had just left to scout on
the Monongahela.</p>

<p>I asked him whether messengers had brought me answers to my letters
from Lord Dunmore and Miss Warren, and he replied in the negative
and shut the door.</p>

<p>About seven I arose and dressed, standing by the window and looking
out over the square. The streets of Fort Pitt were lively enough
at this early hour; apparently since daybreak hundreds of refugees,
men, women, and toddling infants, fleeing from the red scourge
on the outer frontiers, had been coming into Pittsburg town. Many
were almost naked, proving their dire peril and hasty night retreat,
some drove a few sheep or calves, some carried geese or chickens
in their arms, others, more fortunate, guided oxen yoked to wagons,
on which were piled bedding, kettles, dishes, and what poor household
furniture they dared linger to gather before leaving their homes
to the Cayugas and their fields to the timber wolf.</p>

<p>At dawn, when the vanguard of this wretched procession had first
appeared, straggling through Pittsburg streets, the town-watch
took charge of the dazed fugitives and found shelter for them
in the fortress; but, as the town awoke and rubbed its eyes to
find the streets swarming with exhausted strangers dragging their
numbed limbs or sitting on steps and porches, the people threw
open their doors and took the outcasts to their firesides. But
the houses of the Samaritans were filled to overflow ere the cloaked
watchman had called his last hour:</p>

<p>"Four o'clock! A sweet June morning and sad tidings from the
frontier!"</p>

<p>And, as the fugitive creatures still came creeping in past the
fortress, the double guard was called out and squads told off
to conduct the unfortunates to the barracks, court-house, "Governor's
Hall," market-sheds, and finally into the churches. And it was
pitiful to see them making their way painfully into the square,
where many sat down on the turf, and some fell down in the street,
and others slept, leaning upright against fences and trees, clasping
some poor household relic to their breasts.</p>

<p>Bareheaded children lay slumbering on stone steps; young women,
with infants at suck, sat dumb and vacant-eyed on the ground,
too weak to reply to those who offered aid. Haggard men, dragging
their rifles, turned sunken, perplexed eyes, slowly answering
in monosyllables, as though stunned by the swift ruin which had
overwhelmed them.</p>

<p>And the story repeated was always the same: burning and butchery
everywhere; the frontier a charred, blood-soaked desert; homes,
crops, cattle, the very soil itself had gone roaring up in smoke,
and all behind was blackness&mdash;hopeless, unutterable devastation.</p>

<p>The living fled, the dead lay where they had fallen&mdash;and the
dead were many. Scarcely a family but had lost a child or a father;
few of the aged escaped; neighbours had fallen under hatchet and
knife; friends had disappeared.</p>

<p>To and fro the good people of Pitt hastened on their errands
of pity; others, having done their part, gathered in groups discussing
openly the riot of the previous evening and the scenes in "Governor's
Hall."</p>

<p>It was, truly enough, not the first time that Pittsburg streets
had been filled with fugitives from the far frontiers; but last
night's riot was the first which had ever disturbed the little
town, although there had been a disturbance when, early in the
week, a runner from Cresap came in to announce the fate of Logan's
children and the rising of the Cayugas.</p>

<p>But this new outbreak was very different: people and soldiers
had come to blows; blood had flowed, although nobody exactly understood
for what reason it had been shed. Patched pates and plastered
cheeks were plentiful about the streets; there were rumours, too,
of tragedies, but these rumours proved baseless when the morning
wore away. As for the death of Greathouse, nobody suspected it,
because nobody, except Dunmore and his followers, was aware that
Greathouse had fled to Fort Pitt. It is probable that even Wraxall
and Murdy and Tice supposed that Greathouse had escaped from us,
and that he was somewhere in close cover, waiting an opportunity
to rejoin them.</p>

<p>There appeared to be no effort on the part of the town-watch
or of the soldiers to arrest any citizen whose body or apparel
bore marks of the conflict. Citizens and soldiers eyed each other
askance, but apparently without rancour or malice, like generous
adversaries who appreciate a fight for its own sake, and respect
each other for stout blows given and returned.</p>

<p>Certainly neither could complain of the scarcity of knocks. Scores
of noddles had been laid open by citizens' cudgels or by the brass
buckles on the soldiers' belts; scores of pates bore brave bumps
and pretty protuberances, coyly hiding under patches that exhaled
the aroma of vinegar. Many a respectable wig knew its rightful
owner no longer; many a pair of spectacles had been gathered into
Shemuel's basket; many, many hats had vanished into memory, probably,
however, to reappear, peddled by this same Shemuel, when safe
opportunity offered and peace once more smiled her commercial
smile.</p>

<p>That morning I had reckoned with my host of the "Virginia Arms."
As he appeared somewhat uneasy about the reckoning of Jack Mount
and the Weasel, I settled that, too, my means permitting me.</p>

<p>However, I observed to Rolfe that the friends of liberty ought
to trust each other implicitly, and he answered that they did,
especially when cash payments were made.</p>

<p>"Is that the Boston creed?" I asked, scornfully.</p>

<p>"I guess it is," said he, with a shrewd wink.</p>

<p>I began to detest the fellow, and was curt with him as he left
my room; but, when Cade Renard strolled in a few moments later,
I was astonished to learn that this same James Rolfe had aided
Mount to throw the tea-chests into the sea, and had beggared himself
in contributing to every secret patriotic society in Boston.</p>

<p>That was my first lesson in ethics. I began to understand why
it was that generous people turned niggards when it came to paying
tuppence tax on tea; how a man might exact what was his due and
yet be no miser; and how he might beggar himself nor stain his
name as a spendthrift.</p>

<p>"He'll lend me what he has," said the Weasel, sitting down to
lace his hunting-shirt; "but he would be unpleasant if I attempted
to escape from here without a reckoning. I am glad you paid; we
have no money. We were speaking of tapping our fat Tory magistrate
again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Taking the road?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No, taking the judge's purse. He is so fat, positively he disgusts
us."</p>

<p>I looked at the little man in horror. He returned my gaze mildly,
and tied the leather laces under his chin.</p>

<p>"If," said I, stiffly, "you or Mount require money, I beg you
will borrow it from me, as long as we travel together. Also,"
I continued, angrily, "you may as well know that I do not care
to figure with you and Jack Mount in any book or ballad or pamphlet
decorated with a picture of a gallows!"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose we like that picture either?" asked the Weasel,
in astonishment. "Why, Mr. Cardigan, that picture is perfectly
repulsive to us."</p>

<p>"Then why do you take the King's highway?" I asked, blankly.</p>

<p>"You are hurting my feelings," said the Weasel. "Why do you use
such terms? Besides, we discriminate; we only offer ourselves
some slight recompense for the disgust which overpowers us when
we meet with fat Tory magistrates on a moonlit highway."</p>

<p>I stared at him, indignant at the levity with which he used me;
but after a moment I was obliged to believe that he intended no
levity, for never had I seen such guileless innocence in any features.
Clearly the man's past sorrows had been too much for his mind.
He was simple.</p>

<p>There was little profit in continuing the subject; if Renard
and Mount chose to justify their reputations I could not prevent
them. As far as I was concerned they had proved kindly and loyal,
and, now that I was so soon to part with them, I desired to do
so in gratitude and friendship.</p>

<p>It was already past eight o'clock by the Weasel's large silver
watch, and still no reply came to me from either Dunmore or Silver
Heels. Renard and I looked out of the window, watching the soldiers
conducting the homeless frontier families to the barracks. We
spoke of last night's riot, computing the casualties suffered
by the soldiers and wondering what proclamation Dunmore would
issue, or if he would have the courage to issue any, considering
how the people had shown their detestation of him.</p>

<p>"If you were not a deputy of Sir William Johnson, Dunmore would
have jailed you for what you said," observed the Weasel. "You
have cast the last grain into the scales and they have tipped
him out, repudiated and dishonoured. <em>Hic jacet Dunmoreus,
in articulo mortis.</em> But Walter Butler lives, friend Michael.
Beware, sir! <em>Latet anguis in herba!</em>&mdash;there lies the snake
perdu!"</p>

<p>"Who are you, Weasel?" I asked, curiously. "Truly, you are smoother
in Latin than am I; but I confess myself disguised in this hunting-shirt,
whereas you wear it to the manner born. Yet, I swear you are no
forest-runner withal."</p>

<p>"I was born a gentleman," said the Weasel, simply. "I read the
classics for my pleasure&mdash;but I am forgetting, Mr. Cardigan, I
am forgetting so many, many things. It is sixteen years now since
I met with my trouble&mdash;sixteen years to forget in&mdash;and that with
a mind which is not quite clear, sir, not quite clear. However,
I have remembered enough Latin to entertain you, and that is something,
after all, if it is not an answer to your question."</p>

<p>He spoke gently, but there was a sting in the tail of his speech
which I certainly deserved for my impertinent prying into his
past, and I very promptly asked his pardon for my thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>"I am certain it was nothing more than that," he said, cheerfully;
"pray you, my dear sir, believe me that I took no offence. Sometimes
my tongue is sharp; my infirmity is my poor apology. I do not
wonder at your amusement to hear a shabby forest-runner stammer
Latin. But I shall forget my Latin, too; I shall forget all save
what I pray to forget."</p>

<p>With his forefinger he quietly obliterated a tear in each eye.</p>

<p>"You know I had a wife?" he asked.</p>

<p>"And baby," I added, mechanically.</p>

<p>"Exactly, sir; a wife and baby girl&mdash;the sweetest little maid&mdash;"</p>

<p>And, following his mania, to which I lent myself out of pity,
he repeated the fragments of the tale I had come to know so well,
adding nothing new, nor casting any light on anything he said.</p>

<p>Mount came in noisily while the Weasel was speaking, but, though
the big fellow was impatient and burning to exhibit the new clothes
which he wore, he sat down quietly until Renard had finished the
familiar tale. Heaven alone knows how many times Mount had heard
it, but his sympathy never failed, and now he looked so tenderly
and lovingly at the Weasel that I almost loved him for it, swaggering,
tippling, graceless purse-taker that he was.</p>

<p>However, after maintaining for a full minute that sober silence
which decency as well as his loyal affection for the Weasel required,
he ventured to call our attention to his new buckskins, fitted,
cut, and stitched in twenty-four hours by four tailor-women, whom
he described as modest and yet no bigots, as they had appreciated
the kiss apiece which he had joyously bestowed upon them.</p>

<p>"No saucy maid durst call me pottle-pot now!" he said, triumphantly,
smoothing his soft, new garments with his fingers, and regarding
his deeply fringed legs with naïve delight. "Which brings to mind
that I have drunk no morning draught this day," he added, clacking
his tongue and winking at the Weasel.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cardigan is in some trouble," observed the Weasel, hesitating.</p>

<p>"Oh, then we won't drink while a friend is in trouble," said
Mount, sitting down on the bed.</p>

<p>"It is only that I have no letter from Dunmore or from Miss Warren,"
I muttered, looking out into the street to spy if a messenger
were coming our way.</p>

<p>We sat there in silence, gnawing our knuckles, and it did not
please me to wait Lord Dunmore's pleasure like a servant.</p>

<p>That Silver Heels had not yet written also displeased me, for
I was not then habituated to the ways of a maid.</p>

<p>"Do you think the runner I hired to carry my letter to Sir William
will be scalped?" I asked, turning to look at Mount.</p>

<p>"He <em>has</em> been scalped," said Mount, quietly.</p>

<p>Thunderstruck, I sprang to my feet, and finally found tongue
to ask how he had heard such news.</p>

<p>"Why, lad," he said, modestly, "I followed your runner last night
when he left you abed here, and he had not gone ten paces from
this inn ere a man left the shadow of the trees yonder to dog
us both. It was what I feared; but, Lord! &mdash;I caught the
fellow by the market yonder, and trounced him till he could neither
stand nor sit. I was a fool; I should have followed your runner
and brought him back. I did follow, but he had struck a fast pace,
and besides they delayed me at the fortress gate with questions
about my business. When I cleared the sentries I started to run;
but my journey was short enough, God knows!"</p>

<p>He paused, looking down at the fur cap he was slowly twirling
on his thumb.</p>

<p>"Your messenger lay dead by the wood's edge," he added, abruptly.</p>

<p>"I had not dreamed the savages were so near," said I, horrified.</p>

<p>"<em>Some</em> savages are," he observed.</p>

<p>"Was he scalped?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In Mohawk style, lad."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Not at all. I say he was scalped in Mohawk fashion, leaving
the raw strip over the forehead, but I did not say that Mohawks
scalped him."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked, huskily.</p>

<p>"I mean that Walter Butler's men did this, and that your letter
is now in Dunmore's hands."</p>

<p>Rage blinded me. Doubtless I made some noise and talked wildly
of seeking Dunmore, and I know I found myself struggling with
Mount to leave the room. But I was an infant in his grasp, and
presently I sat down again, perforce, while Mount and Renard reasoned
with me somewhat sternly.</p>

<p>"The sooner you leave Pitt the safer for you," said Mount. "The
town talks of little but your accusation of Dunmore last night.
You may think yourself safe because you are Sir William Johnson's
deputy, but I know that Dunmore and Butler will treat you as they
did your messenger if you give them half a chance. What's to prove
that the Cayugas be not your murderers? Tush, lad! This is no
time for boyish fury. Get your kinswoman, Miss Warren, out of
this town. Get her out to-night. Are you waiting for Dunmore's
escort and horses? You will see neither, save perhaps in pursuit
of you. Why, lad, the Governor is crazed with the disgrace you
have brought upon him! Trust me, he will stop at nothing where
he can strike unseen."</p>

<p>"You mean he will not answer my letter or accord me escort?"
I asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"If he furnished you escort, it would be an escort of murderers
who would take care you never saw Johnstown," said the Weasel.</p>

<p>"Can't you feel that you are in a trap?" asked Mount. "Gad! it
should pinch you ere this!"</p>

<p>"And you leave it to us to open it for you," added the Weasel,
sagely. "We are none too safe here ourselves. Mayhap some of those
same pamphlets and ballads and books may be sold hereabouts to
our discredit."</p>

<p>"I also think that Cade and I have outstayed our welcome," said
Mount, with a grin. "If we meet your friend Butler, run we must."</p>

<p>At that moment Rolfe came up from below, bearing in his hand
a letter for me, and saying that it had been brought hither by
a servant in Lady Shelton's livery.</p>

<p>I took the letter; the seal had already been broken, and I glared
at Rolfe and pointed to it.</p>

<p>"Ay," he observed, shaking his head; "the slavering servant fetched
it so. It may be accident; it may be design, Mr. Cardigan. You
best know, sir, who may be your foes in Pittsburg town, and what
they might gain by a knowledge of your letters."</p>

<p>"The inn, here, is closely spied," observed Mount, coolly. "Doubtless
my lady Shelton's lackeys can be bribed as well as the King's
ministers."</p>

<p>"The sooner we leave the happier we shall be," said the Weasel,
cheerfully. "Jimmy Rolfe, that stout post-chaise, well provisioned,
and four strong horses might help us to-night&mdash;eh, friend?"</p>

<p>"I cannot pay for that," I said, blankly, looking up from my
letter.</p>

<p>"The chaise is yours," said Rolfe, resentfully. "Pay when you
can, sir; I trade not with friends in need." And he went out,
disrespectfully slamming the door.</p>

<p>"A rare man," said Mount, "but touchy, lad, touchy. Give the
devil his due and Jim Rolfe would wear shillings on his coat-tails."</p>

<p>"He is a loyal friend," I said, reddening. "I have much to learn
of men."</p>

<p>"And men have much to learn of you, lad!" said Mount, heartily.
"Come, sir, read your nosegay, and may it bring you happiness!
Weasel, turn thy back and make pretence to catch flies."</p>

<p>I went over to the window, and, leaning against the bars, opened
the violated letter and read it carefully:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>DEAR COZZEN MICHAEL,<br/>
&</em>mdash;I am not permitted to accompany you<br/>
today to Johnstown it being a racing day and I pledged to<br/>
attend with Lady Shelton and divers respectable ladies and<br/>
gentlemen.

</p>
<p>
"And oh Micky why did you say such things to Lord Dunmore<br/>
last night? I have been ill of it all night and in a fever<br/>
for fear they may harm you, though Lady Shelton assures me<br/>
your person is safe, being a deputy of Sir William, and<br/>
further says that you are an unmannerly and bold rebel and<br/>
desires not your presence in her house, and desires me to<br/>
inform you. Oh Micky what have you done? I do not desire any<br/>
longer to wed Lord Dunmore and be a Countess, but I had not<br/>
thought to have you speak so to Lord Dunmore. He came here<br/>
last evening in a white fury and showed me the letter you had<br/>
written to him. He says that you are not the messenger he<br/>
expected, though you may be a deputy, and he vows he will not<br/>
be so vilely used, and he will not give me up but will<br/>
publish the banns to-day in Pitt, come what may. Which has<br/>
frightened me so I write to you that I do not wish to be a<br/>
countess any more and would be glad to go to Aunt Molly and<br/>
Sir William.

</p>
<p>
"I will rise from bed at eleven o'clock to-night and go out<br/>
into the orchard with Black Betty. Pray you cozzen, greet me<br/>
with a post-chaise and take me away from these dreadful,<br/>
dreadful people.

</p>
<p>
"Your cozzen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>FELICITY</em>.

</p>
<p>
"Postscriptum

</p>
<p>
"To witt, I will not wed you though we be affianced, and I<br/>
will wed no man upon your recommendation. With your own<br/>
affairs I pray you be dilligently active and concern yourself<br/>
not with mine hereafter."

</p>
</div>
<p>When I had again read the letter I examined the wax. The paper
had been carelessly folded and more carelessly sealed; and I called
to Mount and the Weasel, pointing out that, though the letter
was unsealed, the wax itself had not been broken.</p>

<p>"I do not think," said I, "that this letter has deliberately
been tampered with. This is only carelessness."</p>

<p>"It was certainly sealed and folded in haste," remarked the Weasel,
poking at the wax with his forefinger.</p>

<p>Mount also pretended to believe that negligence or haste accounted
for the open letter, and, satisfied, we sat down to discuss the
measures to be taken for a fortnight flight.</p>

<p>I had a mind to follow Silver Heels to the races, trusting that
I might find a moment to warn her most solemnly not to fail us.
Mount thought the idea most wise, offering to bear me company,
and the Weasel agreed to remain and assist Rolfe to equip and
furnish our post-chaise with the necessaries for a long journey.</p>

<p>It was understood between us that Silver Heels and Black Betty
were to ride in the chaise, and I with them; that Mount and the
Weasel would sit the horses as postilions, and that Shemuel should
ride atop. It was further decided that, as the northern and western
frontier were impassable in view of the border war, we should
take the post-road to the Virginia border, make for Williamsburg,
and from there turn north across Maryland and the Jerseys, reaching
Johnstown through New York and Albany.</p>

<p>I gave the Weasel money to purchase powder and ball, which we
all lacked, and to buy for me a silver watch and a rifle or firelock
to replace the loss of my own. Also, I charged him to purchase
pistols for me and for Shemuel, with flint and ball for the same,
and to sharpen our knives and hatchets against need.</p>

<p>"You waste breath," observed Mount, yawning. "The Weasel never
neglects to file his claws for battle."</p>

<p>"Very well," said I, wincing; "it seems that of us all I alone
know nothing of my own affairs."</p>

<p>"You will learn," said the Weasel, kindly, and I was obliged
to swallow their well-meant patronage and follow Mount to the
street.</p>

<p>"If I had my way," said I, resentfully, "I would take Miss Warren
from the races and set out by noon."</p>

<p>"If I had my way," observed Mount, "I should not try to escape
to-night at all."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Because of that unsealed letter."</p>

<p>"But we agreed it was accident!"</p>

<p>"Ay, <em>we</em> agree, but mayhap there are others yet to disagree."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" I said.</p>

<p>"Doubtless," said Mount, with the faintest trace of irony, enough
to flavour his mild smile with that mockery which hurts the pride
of very young men.</p>

<p>Offended, I strode on beside him, and neither he nor I offered
to speak again until Mount suddenly stopped in the middle of the
King's Road and looked back.</p>

<p>"What's amiss?" I asked, forgetting my sulks.</p>

<p>"Oh, we are followed again," said Mount, wearily.</p>

<p>I stared about but could see nobody who appeared to be observing
us. There were numbers of people on the King's Road, trudging
through the dust as were we, and doubtless also bound for the
races on Roanoke Plain. I saw no vehicles or horsemen: the quality
in their chairs and coaches would go by the fashionable Boundary;
the fox-hunting horsemen met at the "Buckeye Tavern," a resort
for British officers and gentlemen; unpretentious folk must foot
it by the shortest route, which was to pass the fortress by the
King's Road.</p>

<p>"Are you sure we are followed?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not quite," said Mount, simply. "I shall know anon. Trust me
in this, lad, and take pains to do instantly what I do. Perhaps
my life may pay for this day's pleasure."</p>

<p>"I will take care to imitate you," said I, anxiously. "You know
how deeply in your debt I stand confessed."</p>

<p>"Good lad," he said, gravely; "I do not doubt you, friend Michael.
As for any debt, your courtesy has long cancelled it."</p>

<p>The quaint compliment had a pretty savour, coming from one whose
world was not my own.</p>

<p>We were now passing that angle of the fortified works through
which the King's Road passes between two block-housen. The sentries,
standing in the shadow of the stockade, watched us without visible
interest, turning their idle heads to scan the next comer, and
stare impudently if it were some petticoat.</p>

<p>So, unquestioned, we passed out into the country, where a few
heavily stockaded farms flanked the road, always built on heights,
and always free from trees or any cover that might shelter an
attacking enemy. Beyond these farms the road became a turnpike,
and we stopped at the toll-gate to pay tuppence to the keeper's
wife, who sat nursing a baby, one hand on a rifle, which she never
let go until the evening brought her husband to keep his perilous
vigil there all night.</p>

<p>"No," she said, listlessly, "no Indians have troubled us. Yet,
God knows I sleep not while my man is out here in the night, though
they send a patrol from the fortress every hour."</p>

<p>Mount earnestly advised her to give up the toll-gate until the
border had quieted; but she only stared, saying, "How, then, are
we to live?" And we passed on in silence, side by side.</p>

<p>Beyond the toll-gate a broad road curved out from the turnpike,
running south, and Mount pointed it out as the road we were to
travel that night.</p>

<p>"It crosses the Virginia border by that blue hill yonder," he
said, then suddenly jerked his head over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I think I am right; I think I know the jade," he said, calmly.</p>

<p>"Is it a woman who follows us?" I asked, amazed.</p>

<p>"Ay, a bit of a lass, maybe eighteen or thereabouts."</p>

<p>"You know her?"</p>

<p>"And she me," said Mount, grimly. "Harkee, friend Michael, if
you must needs know the truth, her father is &mdash;Gad! I can
scarce say it to you, but&mdash;well&mdash;her father is what they call
a thief-taker."</p>

<p>"What has that to do with us?" I asked.</p>

<p>Mount spoke with an effort: "Because I have stopped some few
purse-proud magistrates upon the highway, they say evil things
o' me. That lass behind us means to follow me and tell her lout
of a father where I may be found."</p>

<p>I was horrified, and he saw it and stopped short in his tracks.</p>

<p>"You are right," he said, simply; "a gentleman cannot be found
in such company. Go on alone, lad; it is right, and I shall bear
no malice."</p>

<p>"Jack!" I said, hotly; "do you believe I would cry quits now?
Damnation! Come on, sir! I would as soon take the King's highway
myself!"</p>

<p>His firm mouth relaxed and quivered a little; he hesitated, then
walked forward beside me with a touch of that old swagger, muttering
something about gentle blood and what's bred in the bone.</p>

<p>"It's all very well," he said; "it's all very well for some of
our people to say that we men are created equal. There's no truth
in it. A broodhound never cast whippets, let them say what they
will!"</p>

<p>We were now in sight of the flag-covered pavilion on Roanoke
Plain, and on either side of us the road was lined with those
drinking-booths and peddler-stands and cheap-jack tents which
had pitched camps here for the day rather than pay the tax required
to sell their wares within the racing-grounds.</p>

<p>Around them the townspeople clustered, some munching gingerbread
and pies, some watching the gilded wheel of fortune spin their
pennies into another man's pockets, some paying for a peep into
a dark shed where doubtless wonders were to be seen for a penny.
Ragged children sold colours and cards for the races; peddlers
assailed our ears at every step; fortune-tellers followed us,
predicting unexpected blessings, which turned to curses when we
passed along unheeding; acrobats, tumblers, jugglers, strong men,
and merry-andrews hailed us as their proper prey. And, in sooth,
had it not been for the sickening knowledge of Mount's peril,
I should have found keen pleasure in spending all I had, to see
everybody and everything at this show; for I do dearly love strange
sights, and in Johnstown I have always viewed them all, with Silver
Heels and Esk and Peter, when the season of racing brought these
gay folk to our town.</p>

<p>But now I had no stomach for pleasure, nor had Mount, for he
scarcely glanced at the booths as we passed, though there was
ale there, and sweet Virginia wines, which drew the very honey-bees
themselves.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mount said, "This will not do; I have been hunted long
enough!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Hunt in my turn," he said, grimly.</p>

<p>"Hunt&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"The lass who hunts me. Follow, lad. On your life, do as I do.
Now, then! Gay! Gay! Ruffle it, lad! Cut a swagger, cock your
cap, and woe to the maid who is beguiled by us!"</p>

<p>The change in him was amazing; his airs, his patronage, his chaff,
his lightening wit!&mdash;it was the old Mount again, quaffing a great
cup of ale, pledging every pretty face that passed, hammering
his pewter to emphasize his words, talking with all who would
answer him; glorious in his self-esteem, amusing in his folly,
a dandy, a ruffler, a careless, wine-bibbing, wench-bussing coureur-de-bois,
and king of them all without an effort.</p>

<p>Peddler and gypsy were no match for him; his banter silenced
the most garrulous, his teasing pleased the wenches, his gay gallantries
made many a girl look back at him, and many a smile was returned
to him with delicate surplus of interest.</p>

<p>"Which is the maid?" I asked, under my breath.</p>

<p>"Yonder, stopping to stare at gingerbread as though she had never
beheld such a sweet before. Now she turns; mark! It is she with
the pink print and chip hat on her hair, tied with rose ribbons
under the chin."</p>

<p>"I see her," said I.</p>

<p>She was a healthy, red-cheeked, blue-eyed girl, with lips a trifle
over-full and bosom to match withal. She appeared uneasy and uncertain,
watching Mount when he raised a laugh, and laughing herself as
excuse, though her mirth appeared to me uneasy, now that I understood
her purpose.</p>

<p>She had been edging nearer, and now stood close to us, at the
entrance to an arbour wherein were set benches in little corners,
hidden from prying eyes by strips of painted cloth.</p>

<p>"Will no maid pity me!" exclaimed Mount. "I am far, far too young
to drink my wine alone in yonder arbour!"</p>

<p>"I have not been invited," cried a saucy wench, laughing at us
over the shoulder of her companion, who backed away, half laughing,
half frightened.</p>

<p>"God helps those who help themselves," said Mount, turning to
find her who had followed him close to his elbow.</p>

<p>He smiled in her face and made her a very slow and very low bow,
drawing a furrow through the dust with the fluffy tail on his
coon-skin cap.</p>

<p>"If I knew your name," he said, "I might die contented. Otherwise
I shall content myself with a life of ignorance."</p>

<p>She seemed startled and abashed, fingering her gown and looking
at her shoe-buckles, while Mount bent beside her to whisper and
smile and swagger until he entreated her to taste a glass of currant
wine with us in the arbour.</p>

<p>I do not know to this day why she consented. Perhaps she thought
to confirm her suspicions and entrap some admission from Mount;
perhaps, in the light of later events, her purpose was very different.
However, we three sat in the arbour behind our screens of painted
cloth, and Mount did set such a pace for us that ere I was aware
there remained not a drop of currant in the decanter, no more
cakes on the plate, and he had his arm around the silly maid.</p>

<p>Intensely embarrassed and ill at ease with this pot-house gallantry,
which was ever offensive to my tastes, I regarded them sideways
in silence, impatient for Mount to end it all.</p>

<p>The end had already begun; Mount rose lightly to his feet and
drew the girl with him, turning her quietly by the shoulders and
looking straight into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why do you follow me?" he asked, coolly.</p>

<p>The colour left her face; her eyes flew wide open with fright.</p>

<p>"I shall not hurt you, little fool," he said; "I had rather your
father, the thief-taker, took me, than harm you. Yes, I am that
same Jack Mount. You are poor; they will pay you for compassing
my arrest. Come, shall we seek your father, Billy Bishop, the
taker of thieves?"</p>

<p>He drew her towards the gate, but she fell a-whimpering and caught
his arm, hiding her face in his buckskin sleeve.</p>

<p>Disgusted, I waited a moment, then turned my back and walked
out into the sunshine, where I paced to and fro, until at last
Mount joined me, wearing a scowl.</p>

<p>As we turned away together I glanced into the arbour and saw
our lass of the ribbons still sitting at the table with her head
buried in her arms and her pink shell-hat on the grass.</p>

<p>As for Mount, he said nothing except that, though he no longer
feared the girl, he meant, hereafter, to trust to his heels in
similar situations.</p>

<p>"It might be less irksome," said I, curling my lip.</p>

<p>"Ay; yet she has a pretty face, and a plump neck, too."</p>

<p>"The daughter of a thief-taker!" I added, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said he. "She has thirty sound teeth and ten fingers;
the Queen of Spain has no more."</p>
