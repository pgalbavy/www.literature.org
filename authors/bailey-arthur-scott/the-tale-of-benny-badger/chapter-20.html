<p>Benny Badger lay motionless, with his long hair parted along the middle
of his back and flowing off his sides in such a fashion that a careless
passer-by would not have noticed that it was anything more than dry
grass.
</p>
<p>For several days Benny had been watching for the rancher. And now, at
last, he saw him coming, riding on a horse over the rolling plain.
</p><p>There was another man with the rancher. And as soon as Benny caught the
murmur of their voices he made ready to hear many pleasant remarks about
himself. He was only waiting until the riders should discover the holes
he had dug near the prairie dog village.
</p><p>Nearer and nearer came the men. And Benny Badger crouched lower and
lower.
</p><p>They had passed him, and ridden a bit nearer the village, when the
rancher suddenly pulled his horse to a stand.
</p><p>"Ah!" Benny Badger exclaimed under his breath. "He sees the new
post-holes that I've dug for him. And how pleased he'll be!"
</p><p>It was true that the rancher had just noticed the holes for the first
time. The moment he saw them he gave a great roar.
</p><p>"A badger!" he shouted. "We'll have to trap him. I can't have him
tearing my ranch up like this. These holes are the finest things in the
world to break a critter's leg in."
</p><p>Benny Badger could scarcely believe what his own ears told him. He
thought there must be a mistake somewhere. And when the rancher declared
that the badger that dug those holes was worse than a whole village of
prairie dogs, Benny was tempted, for one wild moment, to dash up to the
men and tell them exactly what he thought.
</p><p>But he remembered, in time, what the rancher had just said about
trapping him. And he never stirred until the two riders had moved along.
</p><p>When they had ridden beyond the next rise Benny Badger made a rush for
his hole. And there he stayed all the rest of that day.
</p><p>He didn't quite know what to do. And a little later he felt more
uncomfortable than ever when the rancher began to build his new fence
around the prairie dog village, without using a single one of the
post-holes that Benny had dug for him.
</p><p>All Benny's neighbors noticed what was happening. And they no longer
told Benny what a clever fellow he was. On the contrary, they laughed
slyly, and said things to one another whenever Benny Badger came near
them.
</p><p>When he growled at them they always pretended to be surprised to see
him, and asked him if he had "dug any post-holes lately."
</p><p>But Benny Badger never answered that question. Every time he heard it he
felt like moving away from the neighborhood. And when he came home early
one morning and found a <u>trap</u> right in his doorway he made up his mind
then and there that matters had gone far enough.
</p><p>He turned away. And without stopping to tell anybody what he intended to
do, or where he was going--without even saying good-by--he stole away
across the plains to hunt for a new home.
