<p>The three women met in the drawing-room. Mme. Morestal walked up and
down in dismay, hardly knowing what she was saying:
</p><p>"Not in!... Philippe neither!... Victor, you must run ... but where
to?... Where is he to look?... Oh, it's really too terrible!..."
</p><p>She suddenly stepped in front of Marthe and stammered:
</p><p>"The ... the shots ... last night...."
</p><p>Marthe, pale with anxiety, did not reply. She had had the same awful
thought from the first moment.
</p><p>But Suzanne exclaimed:
</p><p>"In any case, Marthe, you need not be alarmed. Philippe did not take the
road by the frontier."
</p><p>"Are you sure?"
</p><p>"We separated at the Carrefour du Grand-Chêne. M. Morestal and papa went
on by themselves. Philippe came straight back."
</p><p>"No, he can't have come straight back, or he would be here now," said
Marthe. "What can he have been doing all night? He has not even set
foot in his room!"
</p><p>But Mme. Morestal was terrified by what Suzanne had said. She could now
no longer doubt that her husband had taken the frontier-road; and the
shots had come from the frontier!
</p><p>"Yes, that's true," said Suzanne, "but it was only ten o'clock when we
started from Saint-Élophe and the shots which you heard were fired at
one or two o'clock in the morning.... You said so yourself."
</p><p>"How can I tell?" cried the old lady, who was beginning to lose her head
entirely. "It may have been much earlier."
</p><p>"But your father must know," said Marthe to Suzanne. "Did he tell you
nothing?"
</p><p>"I have not seen my father this morning," said Suzanne. "He was not
awake...."
</p><p>She had not time to finish her sentence before an idea burst in upon
her, an idea so natural that the two other women were struck by it also
and none of them dared put it into words.
</p><p>Suzanne flew to the door, but Marthe held her back. Why not telephone to
Saint-Élophe, to the special commissary's house?
</p><p>A minute later, M. Jorancé's servant replied that she had just noticed
that her master was not in. His bed had not been touched either.
</p><p>"Oh!" said Suzanne, trembling all over. "My poor father!... Can
anything have happened to him?... My poor father! I ought to have...."
</p><p>They stood for a moment as though paralyzed, all three, and incapable of
taking a resolution. The man-servant went out saying that he would
saddle the horse and gallop to the Col du Diable.
</p><p>Marthe, who was nearest to the telephone, rang up the mayor's office at
Saint-Élophe, on the off-chance, and asked for news. They knew nothing
there. But two gendarmes, it seemed, had just crossed the square at a
great pace. Thereupon, at the suggestion of Mme. Morestal, who had taken
up the second receiver, she asked to be put on to the gendarmery. As
soon as she was connected, she explained her reason for telephoning and
was informed that the sergeant was on his way to the frontier with a
peasant who declared that he had found the body of a man in the woods
between the Butte-aux-Loups and the Col du Diable. That was all they
were able to tell her....
</p><p>Mme. Morestal let go the receiver and fell in a dead faint. Marthe and
Suzanne tried to attend to her. But their hands trembled and, when
Catherine, the maid-servant, appeared upon the scene, they both ran out
of the room, roused by a sudden energy and an immense need of doing
something, of walking, of laying eyes upon that dead body whose
blood-stained image obsessed their minds.
</p><p>They went down the stairs of the terrace and scurried in the direction
of the Étang-des-Moines. They had not gone fifty yards, when they were
passed by Victor, who galloped by on horseback and shouted:
</p><p>"Go in, go in! What's the use? I shall be back again!"
</p><p>They went on nevertheless. But two roads offered: Suzanne wanted to take
the one leading to the pass, on the left; Marthe, the one on the right,
through the woods. They exchanged sharp words, blocking each other's
way.
</p><p>Suddenly, Suzanne, without knowing what she was saying, flung herself
into her friend's arms, blurting out:
</p><p>"I must tell you.... It is my duty.... Besides, it is all my fault...."
</p><p>Marthe, enraged and not understanding the words, which she was to
remember so clearly later, spoke to her roughly:
</p><p>"You're quite mad to-day," she said. "Leave me alone, do."
</p><p>She darted into the woods and, in a few minutes, came to an abandoned
quarry. The path went no further. She had a fit of fury, was on the
verge of throwing herself on the ground and bursting into tears and
then retraced her steps, for she thought she heard some one call. It was
Suzanne, who had seen a man coming from the frontier on horseback and
who had vainly tried to make herself heard. He was no doubt bringing
news....
</p><p>Panting and exhausted, they went back again. But there was no one at the
Old Mill, no one but Mme. Morestal and Catherine, who were praying on
the terrace. All the servants had gone off, without plan or purpose, in
search of information; and the man on the horse, a peasant, had passed
without looking up.
</p><p>Then they dropped on a bench near the balustrade and sat stupefied, worn
out by the effort which they had just made; and horrible minutes
followed. Each of the three women thought of her own special sorrow and
each, besides, suffered the anguish of the unknown disaster that
threatened all three of them. They dared not look at one another. They
dared not speak, although the silence tortured them. The least sound
represented a source of foolish hope or horrid dread; and, with their
eyes fixed on the line of dark woods, they waited.
</p><p>Suddenly, they rose with a start. Catherine, who was keeping a look-out
on the steps of the staircase, had sprung to her feet:
</p><p>"There's Henriot!" she cried.
</p><p>"Henriot?" echoed Mme. Morestal.
</p><p>"Yes, the gardener's boy: I can make him out from here."
</p><p>"Where? We haven't seen him come."
</p><p>"He must have taken a short cut.... He is coming up the stairs....
Quick, Henriot!... Hurry!... Do you know anything?"
</p><p>She pulled open the gate and a lad of fifteen or so, his face bathed in
perspiration, appeared.
</p><p>He at once said:
</p><p>"There's a deserter been killed ... a German deserter."
</p><p>And the three women were forthwith overcome with a great sense of peace.
After the rush of events that had come upon them like a tempest, it
seemed to them as though nothing could touch them now. The phantom of
death vanished from their minds. A man had been shot, no doubt, but that
didn't matter, because the man was not one of theirs. And the gladness
that revived them was such that they could almost have laughed.
</p><p>And, once again, Catherine appeared. She announced that Victor was
returning. And the three women saw a man spurring his horse at the mouth
of the pass, at the imminent risk of breaking his neck on the steep
slope of the road. It was soon apparent, when the man reached the
Étang-des-Moines, that some one was following him with swift strides;
and Marthe uttered cries of joy at recognizing the tall figure of her
husband.
</p><p>She waved her handkerchief. Philippe answered the signal.
</p><p>"It's he!" she said, almost swooning. "It's he, mamma.... I am sure that
he'll be able to tell us everything ... and that M. Morestal is not far
off...."
</p><p>"Let us go and meet them," Suzanne suggested.
</p><p>"Yes, I'll go," said Marthe, quickly. "You stay here, Suzanne ... stay
with mamma."
</p><p>She darted away, eager to be the first to welcome Philippe and
recovering enough strength to run to the bottom of the slope:
</p><p>"Philippe! Philippe!" she cried. "You are back at last...."
</p><p>He lifted her off the ground and pressed her to him:
</p><p>"My darling, I hear that you have been uneasy.... You need not have
been.... I will tell you all about it...."
</p><p>"Yes, you will tell us.... But come ... come quick and kiss your mother
and reassure her...."
</p><p>She dragged him along. They climbed the staircase and, on reaching the
terrace, he suddenly found himself in the presence of Suzanne, who was
waiting, convulsed with jealousy and hatred. Philippe's emotion was so
great that he did not even offer her his hand. Besides, at that moment,
Mme. Morestal ran up to him:
</p><p>"Your father?"
</p><p>"Alive."
</p><p>And Suzanne, in her turn:
</p><p>"Papa?"
</p><p>"Alive also.... They have both been carried off by the German police,
near the frontier."
</p><p>"What? Prisoners?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"They haven't hurt them?"
</p><p>The three women all stood round him and pressed him with questions. He
replied, laughing:
</p><p>"A little calmness, first.... I confess I feel rather dazed.... This
makes two exciting nights.... Also, I am simply starving."
</p><p>His shoes and clothes were grey with dust. There was blood on one of his
shirt-cuffs.
</p><p>"You are wounded!" cried Marthe.
</p><p>"No ... not I.... I'll explain to you...."
</p><p>Catherine brought him a cup of coffee, which he swallowed greedily, and
he began:
</p><p>"It was about five o'clock in the morning when I got up; and I certainly
had no idea, when I left my room ..."
</p><p>Marthe was stupefied. Why did Philippe say that he had slept there? Did
he not know that his absence had been discovered? But then why tell
that lie?
</p><p>She instinctively placed herself in front of Suzanne and in front of her
mother; and, as Philippe had broken off, himself embarrassed by the
obvious commotion which he had caused, she asked him:
</p><p>"So, last evening, you left your father and M. Jorancé?..."
</p><p>"At the Carrefour du Grand-Chêne."
</p><p>"Yes, so Suzanne told us. And you came back straight?"
</p><p>"Straight."
</p><p>"But you heard the shots fired?..."
</p><p>"Shots?"
</p><p>"Yes, on the frontier."
</p><p>"No. I must have gone to sleep at once.... I was tired.... Otherwise, if
I had heard them ..."
</p><p>He had an intuition of the danger which he was running, especially as
Suzanne was trying to make signs to him. But he had prepared the opening
of his story so carefully that, being unaccustomed to lying, he would
have been unable to alter a single word of it without losing the little
coolness that remained to him. Moreover, himself worn out and incapable
of resisting the atmosphere of anxiety and nervousness that surrounded
him, how could he have perceived the trap which Marthe unconsciously
had laid for him? He, therefore, repeated:
</p><p>"Once more, when I left my room, I had no idea of what had happened. It
was an accident that put me in the way of it. I had reached the Col du
Diable and was walking along the frontier-road when, half-way from the
Butte-aux-Loups, I heard moans and groans on my left. I went to the spot
where they came from and discovered, among the bracken, a wounded man,
covered in blood...."
</p><p>"The deserter," said Mme. Morestal.
</p><p>"Yes, a German private, Johann Baufeld," replied Philippe.
</p><p>He was now coming to the true portion of his story, for his interview
with the deserter had really taken place when he was returning from
Saint-Élophe, at break of day; and he continued, with an easier mind:
</p><p>"Johann Baufeld had only a few minutes to live. He had the death-rattle
in his throat. Nevertheless, he had strength enough left to tell me his
name and to speak a few words; and he died in my arms, not, however,
before I learnt from him that M. Jorancé and my father had tried to
protect him on French territory and that the police had turned upon
them. I therefore went in search of them. The track was easy to follow.
It took me through the Col du Diable to the hamlet of Torins. There, the
inn-keeper made no difficulty about telling me that a squad of police,
several of whom were mounted, had passed his house on their way to
Börsweilen, where they were conveying two French prisoners. One of these
was wounded. I could not find out if it was your father, Suzanne, or
mine. In any case, the wounds must have been slight, for both prisoners
were sitting their horses without assistance. I felt reassured and
turned back. At the Col du Diable, I met Victor.... You know the rest."
</p><p>He seemed quite happy at finishing his story and poured himself out a
second cup of coffee, with the satisfied air of a man who has got off
cheaply.
</p><p>The three women were silent. Suzanne lowered her head, lest she should
betray her emotion. At last, Marthe, who had no suspicions, but who was
worrying her head about Philippe's falsehood, resumed:
</p><p>"At what time did you come in last night?"
</p><p>"At a quarter to eleven."
</p><p>"And you went to bed at once?"
</p><p>"At once."
</p><p>"Then how is it that your bed has not been touched?"
</p><p>Philippe gave a start. The question took his breath away. Instead of
inventing some pretext or other, he stammered, guilelessly:
</p><p>"Oh, so you went in ... you saw ..."
</p><p>He had not thought of this detail, nor, for that matter, of any of those
which might make his story appear to clash with the facts; and he no
longer knew what to say.
</p><p>Suzanne suggested:
</p><p>"Perhaps Philippe spent the night in a chair...."
</p><p>Marthe shrugged her shoulders; and Philippe, utterly at a loss, trying
to make up another version, did not even answer. He remained dumb, like
a child caught at fault.
</p><p>"Come, Philippe," asked Marthe, "what's underneath this? Didn't you come
straight back?"
</p><p>"No," he admitted.
</p><p>"You came back by the frontier?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Then why conceal it? I couldn't very well be anxious now, seeing that
you are here."
</p><p>"That's just it!" cried Philippe, plunging at a venture along this path.
"That's just it! I did not want to tell you that I had spent the night
looking for my father."
</p><p>"The night! Then you knew before this morning that he had been carried
off?"
</p><p>"Yes, last evening."
</p><p>"Last evening? But how? Who told you? You can only have known it by
witnessing the arrest."
</p><p>He hesitated for a second. He could have dated his interview with the
deserter Baufeld to that particular moment. But he did not think of
this; and he declared, in a firm tone:
</p><p>"Well, yes, I was there ... or, at least, not far off...."
</p><p>"And you heard the shots?"
</p><p>"Yes, I heard the shots and also some cries of pain.... When I arrived
on the scene of the fighting, there was no one there. Then I hunted
about.... You understand, I was afraid that my father or M. Jorancé had
been hit by the bullets.... I hunted all night, following their track in
the dark: a wrong track, first of all, which led me towards the Albern
Woods. And then, this morning, I found Private Baufeld, who told me
which way the attacking party had gone, and I pushed on to the factory
and to the inn at Torins. But if I had told you all that, oh, by Jove,
how you would have fretted about my fatigue! Why, I can picture you
doing so, my poor Marthe!"
</p><p>He pretended to be gay and careless. Marthe watched him in astonishment.
She nodded her head with a thoughtful air:
</p><p>"Yes ... you are right...."
</p><p>"Don't you think so? It was much simpler to tell you that I had just
left my room, feeling fit and well, after a good night's rest.... Don't
you agree with me, mother?... Besides, you yourself ..."
</p><p>But, at that moment, a sound of voices rose under the windows on the
garden-side and Catherine burst into the room, yelling:
</p><p>"The master! The master!"
</p><p>And Victor also bounded in:
</p><p>"Here's the master coming! There he is!"
</p><p>"Who? Who?" asked Mme. Morestal, hastening forward.
</p><p>"M. Morestal! There he is! We saw him at the end of the garden.... Look,
over there, near the water-fall...."
</p><p>The old lady ran to one of the windows:
</p><p>"Yes! He has seen us! O God, is it possible?"
</p><p>Staggering with excitement, she leant heavily on Marthe's arm and
dragged her to the staircase that led to the front hall and the steps.
</p><p>They had hardly disappeared when Suzanne flung herself upon Philippe:
</p><p>"Oh, please, Philippe ... please!" she implored.
</p><p>He did not understand at first:
</p><p>"What is it, Suzanne?"
</p><p>"Please, please be careful. Don't let Marthe suspect...."
</p><p>"Do you think ...?"
</p><p>"I thought so, for a second.... She gave me such a queer look.... Oh, it
would be terrible!... Please, please ..."
</p><p>She left him quickly, but her words and the scared look in her eyes gave
Philippe a real fright. Hitherto, he had felt towards Marthe only the
embarrassment provoked by the annoyance of having to tell a lie. He now
suddenly perceived the full gravity of the situation, the peril which
threatened Suzanne and which might shatter the happiness of his own
household. One blunder ... and everything was discovered. And this
thought, instead of clearing his brain forthwith, merely increased his
confusion.
</p><p>"I must save Suzanne," he repeated. "Above all, I must save Suzanne."
</p><p>But he felt that he had no more power over the events at hand than a man
has over the approaching storm. And a dull fear arose within his breast.
