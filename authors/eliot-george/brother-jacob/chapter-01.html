<p>Among the many fatalities attending the bloom of young desire, that
of blindly taking to the confectionery line has not, perhaps, been
sufficiently considered.  How is the son of a British yeoman, who
has been fed principally on salt pork and yeast dumplings, to know
that there is satiety for the human stomach even in a paradise of
glass jars full of sugared almonds and pink lozenges, and that the
tedium of life can reach a pitch where plum-buns at discretion cease
to offer the slightest excitement?  Or how, at the tender age when a
confectioner seems to him a very prince whom all the world must
envy - who breakfasts on macaroons, dines on meringues, sups on
twelfth-cake, and fills up the intermediate hours with sugar-candy
or peppermint - how is he to foresee the day of sad wisdom, when he
will discern that the confectioner's calling is not socially
influential, or favourable to a soaring ambition?  I have known a
man who turned out to have a metaphysical genius, incautiously, in
the period of youthful buoyancy, commence his career as a dancing-
master; and you may imagine the use that was made of this initial
mistake by opponents who felt themselves bound to warn the public
against his doctrine of the Inconceivable.  He could not give up his
dancing-lessons, because he made his bread by them, and metaphysics
would not have found him in so much as salt to his bread.  It was
really the same with Mr. David Faux and the confectionery business.
His uncle, the butler at the great house close by Brigford, had made
a pet of him in his early boyhood, and it was on a visit to this
uncle that the confectioners' shops in that brilliant town had, on a
single day, fired his tender imagination.  He carried home the
pleasing illusion that a confectioner must be at once the happiest
and the foremost of men, since the things he made were not only the
most beautiful to behold, but the very best eating, and such as the
Lord Mayor must always order largely for his private recreation; so
that when his father declared he must be put to a trade, David chose
his line without a moment's hesitation; and, with a rashness
inspired by a sweet tooth, wedded himself irrevocably to
confectionery.  Soon, however, the tooth lost its relish and fell
into blank indifference; and all the while, his mind expanded, his
ambition took new shapes, which could hardly be satisfied within the
sphere his youthful ardour had chosen.  But what was he to do?  He
was a young man of much mental activity, and, above all, gifted with
a spirit of contrivance; but then, his faculties would not tell with
great effect in any other medium than that of candied sugars,
conserves, and pastry.  Say what you will about the identity of the
reasoning process in all branches of thought, or about the advantage
of coming to subjects with a fresh mind, the adjustment of butter to
flour, and of heat to pastry, is NOT the best preparation for the
office of prime minister; besides, in the present imperfectly-
organized state of society, there are social barriers.  David could
invent delightful things in the way of drop-cakes, and he had the
widest views of the sugar department; but in other directions he
certainly felt hampered by the want of knowledge and practical
skill; and the world is so inconveniently constituted, that the
vague consciousness of being a fine fellow is no guarantee of
success in any line of business.</p>

<p>This difficulty pressed with some severity on Mr. David Faux, even
before his apprenticeship was ended.  His soul swelled with an
impatient sense that he ought to become something very remarkable - 
that it was quite out of the question for him to put up with a
narrow lot as other men did:  he scorned the idea that he could
accept an average.  He was sure there was nothing average about him:
even such a person as Mrs. Tibbits, the washer-woman, perceived it,
and probably had a preference for his linen.  At that particular
period he was weighing out gingerbread nuts; but such an anomaly
could not continue.  No position could be suited to Mr. David Faux
that was not in the highest degree easy to the flesh and flattering
to the spirit.  If he had fallen on the present times, and enjoyed
the advantages of a Mechanic's Institute, he would certainly have
taken to literature and have written reviews; but his education had
not been liberal.  He had read some novels from the adjoining
circulating library, and had even bought the story of Inkle and
Yarico, which had made him feel very sorry for poor Mr. Inkle; so
that his ideas might not have been below a certain mark of the
literary calling; but his spelling and diction were too
unconventional.</p>

<p>When a man is not adequately appreciated or comfortably placed in
his own country, his thoughts naturally turn towards foreign climes;
and David's imagination circled round and round the utmost limits of
his geographical knowledge, in search of a country where a young
gentleman of pasty visage, lipless mouth, and stumpy hair, would be
likely to be received with the hospitable enthusiasm which he had a
right to expect.  Having a general idea of America as a country
where the population was chiefly black, it appeared to him the most
propitious destination for an emigrant who, to begin with, had the
broad and easily recognizable merit of whiteness; and this idea
gradually took such strong possession of him that Satan seized the
opportunity of suggesting to him that he might emigrate under easier
circumstances, if he supplied himself with a little money from his
master's till.  But that evil spirit, whose understanding, I am
convinced, has been much overrated, quite wasted his time on this
occasion.  David would certainly have liked well to have some of his
master's money in his pocket, if he had been sure his master would
have been the only man to suffer for it; but he was a cautious
youth, and quite determined to run no risks on his own account.  So
he stayed out his apprenticeship, and committed no act of dishonesty
that was at all likely to be discovered, reserving his plan of
emigration for a future opportunity.  And the circumstances under
which he carried it out were in this wise.  Having been at home a
week or two partaking of the family beans, he had used his leisure
in ascertaining a fact which was of considerable importance to him,
namely, that his mother had a small sum in guineas painfully saved
from her maiden perquisites, and kept in the corner of a drawer
where her baby-linen had reposed for the last twenty years - ever
since her son David had taken to his feet, with a slight promise of
bow-legs which had not been altogether unfulfilled.  Mr. Faux,
senior, had told his son very frankly, that he must not look to
being set up in business by HIM:  with seven sons, and one of them a
very healthy and well-developed idiot, who consumed a dumpling about
eight inches in diameter every day, it was pretty well if they got a
hundred apiece at his death.  Under these circumstances, what was
David to do?  It was certainly hard that he should take his mother's
money; but he saw no other ready means of getting any, and it was
not to be expected that a young man of his merit should put up with
inconveniences that could be avoided.  Besides, it is not robbery to
take property belonging to your mother:  she doesn't prosecute you.
And David was very well behaved to his mother; he comforted her by
speaking highly of himself to her, and assuring her that he never
fell into the vices he saw practised by other youths of his own age,
and that he was particularly fond of honesty.  If his mother would
have given him her twenty guineas as a reward of this noble
disposition, he really would not have stolen them from her, and it
would have been more agreeable to his feelings.  Nevertheless, to an
active mind like David's, ingenuity is not without its pleasures:
it was rather an interesting occupation to become stealthily
acquainted with the wards of his mother's simple key (not in the
least like Chubb's patent), and to get one that would do its work
equally well; and also to arrange a little drama by which he would
escape suspicion, and run no risk of forfeiting the prospective
hundred at his father's death, which would be convenient in the
improbable case of his NOT making a large fortune in the &quot;Indies.&quot;</p>

<p>First, he spoke freely of his intention to start shortly for
Liverpool and take ship for America; a resolution which cost his
good mother some pain, for, after Jacob the idiot, there was not one
of her sons to whom her heart clung more than to her youngest-born,
David.  Next, it appeared to him that Sunday afternoon, when
everybody was gone to church except Jacob and the cowboy, was so
singularly favourable an opportunity for sons who wanted to
appropriate their mothers' guineas, that he half thought it must
have been kindly intended by Providence for such purposes.
Especially the third Sunday in Lent; because Jacob had been out on
one of his occasional wanderings for the last two days; and David,
being a timid young man, had a considerable dread and hatred of
Jacob, as of a large personage who went about habitually with a
pitchfork in his hand.</p>

<p>Nothing could be easier, then, than for David on this Sunday
afternoon to decline going to church, on the ground that he was
going to tea at Mr. Lunn's, whose pretty daughter Sally had been an
early flame of his, and, when the church-goers were at a safe
distance, to abstract the guineas from their wooden box and slip
them into a small canvas bag - nothing easier than to call to the
cowboy that he was going, and tell him to keep an eye on the house
for fear of Sunday tramps.  David thought it would be easy, too, to
get to a small thicket and bury his bag in a hole he had already
made and covered up under the roots of an old hollow ash, and he
had, in fact, found the hole without a moment's difficulty, had
uncovered it, and was about gently to drop the bag into it, when the
sound of a large body rustling towards him with something like a
bellow was such a surprise to David, who, as a gentleman gifted with
much contrivance, was naturally only prepared for what he expected,
that instead of dropping the bag gently he let it fall so as to make
it untwist and vomit forth the shining guineas.  In the same moment
he looked up and saw his dear brother Jacob close upon him, holding
the pitchfork so that the bright smooth prongs were a yard in
advance of his own body, and about a foot off David's.  (A learned
friend, to whom I once narrated this history, observed that it was
David's guilt which made these prongs formidable, and that the &quot;mens
nil conscia sibi&quot; strips a pitchfork of all terrors.  I thought this
idea so valuable, that I obtained his leave to use it on condition
of suppressing his name.)  Nevertheless, David did not entirely lose
his presence of mind; for in that case he would have sunk on the
earth or started backward; whereas he kept his ground and smiled at
Jacob, who nodded his head up and down, and said, &quot;Hoich, Zavy!&quot; in
a painfully equivocal manner.  David's heart was beating audibly,
and if he had had any lips they would have been pale; but his mental
activity, instead of being paralysed, was stimulated.  While he was
inwardly praying (he always prayed when he was much frightened) - 
&quot;Oh, save me this once, and I'll never get into danger again!&quot; - he
was thrusting his hand into his pocket in search of a box of yellow
lozenges, which he had brought with him from Brigford among other
delicacies of the same portable kind, as a means of conciliating
proud beauty, and more particularly the beauty of Miss Sarah Lunn.
Not one of these delicacies had he ever offered to poor Jacob, for
David was not a young man to waste his jujubes and barley-sugar in
giving pleasure to people from whom he expected nothing.  But an
idiot with equivocal intentions and a pitchfork is as well worth
flattering and cajoling as if he were Louis Napoleon.  So David,
with a promptitude equal to the occasion, drew out his box of yellow
lozenges, lifted the lid, and performed a pantomime with his mouth
and fingers, which was meant to imply that he was delighted to see
his dear brother Jacob, and seized the opportunity of making him a
small present, which he would find particularly agreeable to the
taste.  Jacob, you understand, was not an intense idiot, but within
a certain limited range knew how to choose the good and reject the
evil:  he took one lozenge, by way of test, and sucked it as if he
had been a philosopher; then, in as great an ecstacy at its new and
complex savour as Caliban at the taste of Trinculo's wine, chuckled
and stroked this suddenly beneficent brother, and held out his hand
for more; for, except in fits of anger, Jacob was not ferocious or
needlessly predatory.  David's courage half returned, and he left
off praying; pouring a dozen lozenges into Jacob's palm, and trying
to look very fond of him.  He congratulated himself that he had
formed the plan of going to see Miss Sally Lunn this afternoon, and
that, as a consequence, he had brought with him these propitiatory
delicacies:  he was certainly a lucky fellow; indeed, it was always
likely Providence should be fonder of him than of other apprentices,
and since he WAS to be interrupted, why, an idiot was preferable to
any other sort of witness.  For the first time in his life, David
thought he saw the advantage of idiots.</p>

<p>As for Jacob, he had thrust his pitchfork into the ground, and had
thrown himself down beside it, in thorough abandonment to the
unprecedented pleasure of having five lozenges in his mouth at once,
blinking meanwhile, and making inarticulate sounds of gustative
content.  He had not yet given any sign of noticing the guineas, but
in seating himself he had laid his broad right hand on them, and
unconsciously kept it in that position, absorbed in the sensations
of his palate.  If he could only be kept so occupied with the
lozenges as not to see the guineas before David could manage to
cover them!  That was David's best hope of safety; for Jacob knew
his mother's guineas; it had been part of their common experience as
boys to be allowed to look at these handsome coins, and rattle them
in their box on high days and holidays, and among all Jacob's narrow
experiences as to money, this was likely to be the most memorable.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, Jacob,&quot; said David, in an insinuating tone, handing the box
to him, &quot;I'll give 'em all to you.  Run! - make haste! - else
somebody'll come and take 'em.&quot;</p>

<p>David, not having studied the psychology of idiots, was not aware
that they are not to be wrought upon by imaginative fears.  Jacob
took the box with his left hand, but saw no necessity for running
away.  Was ever a promising young man wishing to lay the foundation
of his fortune by appropriating his mother's guineas obstructed by
such a day-mare as this?  But the moment must come when Jacob would
move his right hand to draw off the lid of the tin box, and then
David would sweep the guineas into the hole with the utmost address
and swiftness, and immediately seat himself upon them.  Ah, no!
It's of no use to have foresight when you are dealing with an idiot:
he is not to be calculated upon.  Jacob's right hand was given to
vague clutching and throwing; it suddenly clutched the guineas as if
they had been so many pebbles, and was raised in an attitude which
promised to scatter them like seed over a distant bramble, when,
from some prompting or other - probably of an unwonted sensation - it
paused, descended to Jacob's knee, and opened slowly under the
inspection of Jacob's dull eyes.  David began to pray again, but
immediately desisted - another resource having occurred to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Mother! zinnies!&quot; exclaimed the innocent Jacob.  Then, looking at
David, he said, interrogatively, &quot;Box?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hush! hush!&quot; said David, summoning all his ingenuity in this severe
strait.  &quot;See, Jacob!&quot;  He took the tin box from his brother's hand,
and emptied it of the lozenges, returning half of them to Jacob, but
secretly keeping the rest in his own hand.  Then he held out the
empty box, and said, &quot;Here's the box, Jacob!  The box for the
guineas!&quot; gently sweeping them from Jacob's palm into the box.</p>

<p>This procedure was not objectionable to Jacob; on the contrary, the
guineas clinked so pleasantly as they fell, that he wished for a
repetition of the sound, and seizing the box, began to rattle it
very gleefully.  David, seizing the opportunity, deposited his
reserve of lozenges in the ground and hastily swept some earth over
them.  &quot;Look, Jacob!&quot; he said, at last.  Jacob paused from his
clinking, and looked into the hole, while David began to scratch
away the earth, as if in doubtful expectation.  When the lozenges
were laid bare, he took them out one by one, and gave them to Jacob.
&quot;Hush!&quot; he said, in a loud whisper, &quot;Tell nobody - all for Jacob - 
hush - sh - sh!  Put guineas in the hole - they'll come out like this!&quot;
To make the lesson more complete, he took a guinea, and lowering it
into the hole, said, &quot;Put in SO.&quot;  Then, as he took the last lozenge
out, he said, &quot;Come out SO,&quot; and put the lozenge into Jacob's
hospitable mouth.</p>

<p>Jacob turned his head on one side, looked first at his brother and
then at the hole, like a reflective monkey, and, finally, laid the
box of guineas in the hole with much decision.  David made haste to
add every one of the stray coins, put on the lid, and covered it
well with earth, saying in his meet coaxing tone -</p>

<p>&quot;Take 'm out to-morrow, Jacob; all for Jacob!  Hush - sh - sh!&quot;</p>

<p>Jacob, to whom this once indifferent brother had all at once become
a sort of sweet-tasted fetish, stroked David's best coat with his
adhesive fingers, and then hugged him with an accompaniment of that
mingled chuckling and gurgling by which he was accustomed to express
the milder passions.  But if he had chosen to bite a small morsel
out of his beneficent brother's cheek, David would have been obliged
to bear it.</p>

<p>And here I must pause, to point out to you the short-sightedness of
human contrivance.  This ingenious young man, Mr. David Faux,
thought he had achieved a triumph of cunning when he had associated
himself in his brother's rudimentary mind with the flavour of yellow
lozenges.  But he had yet to learn that it is a dreadful thing to
make an idiot fond of you, when you yourself are not of an
affectionate disposition:  especially an idiot with a pitchfork - 
obviously a difficult friend to shake off by rough usage.</p>

<p>It may seem to you rather a blundering contrivance for a clever
young man to bury the guineas.  But, if everything had turned out as
David had calculated, you would have seen that his plan was worthy
of his talents.  The guineas would have lain safely in the earth
while the theft was discovered, and David, with the calm of
conscious innocence, would have lingered at home, reluctant to say
good-bye to his dear mother while she was in grief about her
guineas; till at length, on the eve of his departure, he would have
disinterred them in the strictest privacy, and carried them on his
own person without inconvenience.  But David, you perceive, had
reckoned without his host, or, to speak more precisely, without his
idiot brother - an item of so uncertain and fluctuating a character,
that I doubt whether he would not have puzzled the astute heroes of
M. de Balzac, whose foresight is so remarkably at home in the
future.</p>

<p>It was clear to David now that he had only one alternative before
him:  he must either renounce the guineas, by quietly putting them
back in his mother's drawer (a course not unattended with
difficulty); or he must leave more than a suspicion behind him, by
departing early the next morning without giving notice, and with the
guineas in his pocket.  For if he gave notice that he was going, his
mother, he knew, would insist on fetching from her box of guineas
the three she had always promised him as his share; indeed, in his
original plan, he had counted on this as a means by which the theft
would be discovered under circumstances that would themselves speak
for his innocence; but now, as I need hardly explain, that well-
combined plan was completely frustrated.  Even if David could have
bribed Jacob with perpetual lozenges, an idiot's secrecy is itself
betrayal.  He dared not even go to tea at Mr. Lunn's, for in that
case he would have lost sight of Jacob, who, in his impatience for
the crop of lozenges, might scratch up the box again while he was
absent, and carry it home - depriving him at once of reputation and
guineas.  No! he must think of nothing all the rest of this day, but
of coaxing Jacob and keeping him out of mischief.  It was a
fatiguing and anxious evening to David; nevertheless, he dared not
go to sleep without tying a piece of string to his thumb and great
toe, to secure his frequent waking; for he meant to be up with the
first peep of dawn, and be far out of reach before breakfast-time.
His father, he thought, would certainly cut him off with a shilling;
but what then?  Such a striking young man as he would be sure to be
well received in the West Indies:  in foreign countries there are
always openings - even for cats.  It was probable that some Princess
Yarico would want him to marry her, and make him presents of very
large jewels beforehand; after which, he needn't marry her unless he
liked.  David had made up his mind not to steal any more, even from
people who were fond of him:  it was an unpleasant way of making
your fortune in a world where you were likely to surprised in the
act by brothers.  Such alarms did not agree with David's
constitution, and he had felt so much nausea this evening that no
doubt his liver was affected.  Besides, he would have been greatly
hurt not to be thought well of in the world:  he always meant to
make a figure, and be thought worthy of the best seats and the best
morsels.</p>

<p>Ruminating to this effect on the brilliant future in reserve for
him, David by the help of his check-string kept himself on the alert
to seize the time of earliest dawn for his rising and departure.
His brothers, of course, were early risers, but he should anticipate
them by at least an hour and a half, and the little room which he
had to himself as only an occasional visitor, had its window over
the horse-block, so that he could slip out through the window
without the least difficulty.  Jacob, the horrible Jacob, had an
awkward trick of getting up before everybody else, to stem his
hunger by emptying the milk-bowl that was &quot;duly set&quot; for him; but of
late he had taken to sleeping in the hay-loft, and if he came into
the house, it would be on the opposite side to that from which David
was making his exit.  There was no need to think of Jacob; yet David
was liberal enough to bestow a curse on him - it was the only thing
he ever did bestow gratuitously.  His small bundle of clothes was
ready packed, and he was soon treading lightly on the steps of the
horse-block, soon walking at a smart pace across the fields towards
the thicket.  It would take him no more than two minutes to get out
the box; he could make out the tree it was under by the pale strip
where the bark was off, although the dawning light was rather dimmer
in the thicket.  But what, in the name of - burnt pastry - was that
large body with a staff planted beside it, close at the foot of the
ash-tree?  David paused, not to make up his mind as to the nature of
the apparition - he had not the happiness of doubting for a moment
that the staff was Jacob's pitchfork - but to gather the self-command
necessary for addressing his brother with a sufficiently honeyed
accent.  Jacob was absorbed in scratching up the earth, and had not
heard David's approach.</p>

<p>&quot;I say, Jacob,&quot; said David in a loud whisper, just as the tin box
was lifted out of the hole.</p>

<p>Jacob looked up, and discerning his sweet-flavoured brother, nodded
and grinned in the dim light in a way that made him seem to David
like a triumphant demon.  If he had been of an impetuous
disposition, he would have snatched the pitchfork from the ground
and impaled this fraternal demon.  But David was by no means
impetuous; he was a young man greatly given to calculate
consequences, a habit which has been held to be the foundation of
virtue.  But somehow it had not precisely that effect in David:  he
calculated whether an action would harm himself, or whether it would
only harm other people.  In the former case he was very timid about
satisfying his immediate desires, but in the latter he would risk
the result with much courage.</p>

<p>&quot;Give it me, Jacob,&quot; he said, stooping down and patting his brother.
&quot;Let us see.&quot;</p>

<p>Jacob, finding the lid rather tight, gave the box to his brother in
perfect faith.  David raised the lids and shook his head, while
Jacob put his finger in and took out a guinea to taste whether the
metamorphosis into lozenges was complete and satisfactory.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Jacob; too soon, too soon,&quot; said David, when the guinea had
been tasted.  &quot;Give it me; we'll go and bury it somewhere else;
we'll put it in yonder,&quot; he added, pointing vaguely toward the
distance.</p>

<p>David screwed on the lid, while Jacob, looking grave, rose and
grasped his pitchfork.  Then, seeing David's bundle, he snatched it,
like a too officious Newfoundland, stuck his pitchfork into it and
carried it over his shoulder in triumph as he accompanied David and
the box out of the thicket.</p>

<p>What on earth was David to do?  It would have been easy to frown at
Jacob, and kick him, and order him to get away; but David dared as
soon have kicked the bull.  Jacob was quiet as long as he was
treated indulgently; but on the slightest show of anger, he became
unmanageable, and was liable to fits of fury which would have made
him formidable even without his pitchfork.  There was no mastery to
be obtained over him except by kindness or guile.  David tried
guile.</p>

<p>&quot;Go, Jacob,&quot; he said, when they were out of the thicket - pointing
towards the house as he spoke; &quot;go and fetch me a spade - a spade.
But give ME the bundle,&quot; he added, trying to reach it from the fork,
where it hung high above Jacob's tall shoulder.</p>

<p>But Jacob showed as much alacrity in obeying as a wasp shows in
leaving a sugar-basin.  Near David, he felt himself in the vicinity
of lozenges:  he chuckled and rubbed his brother's back, brandishing
the bundle higher out of reach.  David, with an inward groan,
changed his tactics, and walked on as fast as he could.  It was not
safe to linger.  Jacob would get tired of following him, or, at all
events, could be eluded.  If they could once get to the distant
highroad, a coach would overtake them, David would mount it, having
previously by some ingenious means secured his bundle, and then
Jacob might howl and flourish his pitchfork as much as he liked.
Meanwhile he was under the fatal necessity of being very kind to
this ogre, and of providing a large breakfast for him when they
stopped at a roadside inn.  It was already three hours since they
had started, and David was tired.  Would no coach be coming up soon?
he inquired.  No coach for the next two hours.  But there was a
carrier's cart to come immediately, on its way to the next town.  If
he could slip out, even leaving his bundle behind, and get into the
cart without Jacob!  But there was a new obstacle.  Jacob had
recently discovered a remnant of sugar-candy in one of his brother's
tail-pockets; and, since then, had cautiously kept his hold on that
limb of the garment, perhaps with an expectation that there would be
a further development of sugar-candy after a longer or shorter
interval.  Now every one who has worn a coat will understand the
sensibilities that must keep a man from starting away in a hurry
when there is a grasp on his coat-tail.  David looked forward to
being well received among strangers, but it might make a difference
if he had only one tail to his coat.</p>

<p>He felt himself in a cold perspiration.  He could walk no more:  he
must get into the cart and let Jacob get in with him.  Presently a
cheering idea occurred to him:  after so large a breakfast, Jacob
would be sure to go to sleep in the cart; you see at once that David
meant to seize his bundle, jump out, and be free.  His expectation
was partly fulfilled:  Jacob did go to sleep in the cart, but it was
in a peculiar attitude - it was with his arms tightly fastened round
his dear brother's body; and if ever David attempted to move, the
grasp tightened with the force of an affectionate boa-constrictor.</p>

<p>&quot;Th' innicent's fond on you,&quot; observed the carrier, thinking that
David was probably an amiable brother, and wishing to pay him a
compliment.</p>

<p>David groaned.  The ways of thieving were not ways of pleasantness.
Oh, why had he an idiot brother?  Oh, why, in general, was the world
so constituted that a man could not take his mother's guineas
comfortably?  David became grimly speculative.</p>

<p>Copious dinner at noon for Jacob; but little dinner, because little
appetite, for David.  Instead of eating, he plied Jacob with beer;
for through this liberality he descried a hope.  Jacob fell into a
dead sleep, at last, without having his arms round David, who paid
the reckoning, took his bundle, and walked off.  In another half-
hour he was on the coach on his way to Liverpool, smiling the smile
of the triumphant wicked.  He was rid of Jacob - he was bound for the
Indies, where a gullible princess awaited him.  He would never steal
any more, but there would be no need; he would show himself so
deserving, that people would make him presents freely.  He must give
up the notion of his father's legacy; but it was not likely he would
ever want that trifle; and even if he did - why, it was a
compensation to think that in being for ever divided from his family
he was divided from Jacob, more terrible than Gorgon or Demogorgon
to David's timid green eyes.  Thank heaven, he should never see
Jacob any more!</p>
