<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p><em>THE </em>storm which threatened during the afternoon broke
forth toward night and raged until morning. Little rain fell,
but the wind was terrific, as it howled around the settlement
and screamed through the forest. What rain fell came almost horizontally,
and rattled like hailstones against the cabins.</p>

<p>All night long the dim, yellow light burned in the block-house,
and the shadowy form of a shivering sentinel was never absent
from the platform. It was such a night as to make one relish the
comforts of a shelter. Chilly, windy, and dismal without, it was
all light and sunshine within. A huge fire of hickory logs was
roaring in the fireplace, lighting up the bronzed faces of the
hunters and rangers without the aid of the torch that smoked further
back in the room. Now and then the men were furnished with drinks
of whisky, and their spirits were light and jovial. Dingle and
Peterson were there, relating and listening to stories as usual,
and "all went merry as a marriage-bell."</p>

<p>Little apprehension of an attack was felt, as the late repulse
had taught the Indians a lesson which they could not but heed.
The shivering sentinel paced his walk, slowly and gloomily, while
the keen wind whistled round his ears. As he heard the merry laugh
of those within, he breathed more than one earnest prayer that
the time would hurry by and bring a relief to take his place.
He could not be said to keep a very vigilant watch, as the darkness
was so intense as to prevent; and when the windy rain was hurtled
in his face, he felt more like covering it up with his great cloak
than in peering toward the hoarse, soughing wilderness. He had
first whistled a tune, then hummed it, and was now counting his
steps, to pass away the time. He had calculated the number of
turns he should be compelled to make before his watch would be
up, and was now noting by this means the minutes as they slipped
away.</p>

<p>His watch extended from nine o'clock until midnight. About half
of it had transpired, and he was completely absorbed in enumerating
his steps, when he was brought to a sudden stand-still, and felt
a thrilling chill creep over him, as a voice, faint and suppressed,
but yet distinct and clear, called out from the direction of the
clearing:</p>

<p>"Hello there?"</p>

<p>The sentinel stopped abruptly and looked in the direction from
which the voice came. Once, it seemed, the outlines of a man was
discernible, but it was only an illusion. He reflected that it
might be an artifice, and hesitated before replying. "It's like
enough he wants to find out where I stand, and then blaze away.
However, I'll fix it so that I can answer him."</p>

<p>Leaning himself as much as possible behind the protection of
the platform, he called out:</p>

<p>"What's wanting out there?"</p>

<p>"Admittance; I am half frozen to death. Will you let me in?"</p>

<p>"You must wait till morning, my dear sir."</p>

<p>"But I will perish. Have you a man in the fort named Jim Peterson?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what of it?"</p>

<p>"Call him; he will admit me if you will not."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Tell him Madison Drake wishes to see him."</p>

<p>The sentinel was too wary to leave his post. He suspected that
this was a stratagem of the man to attack the gates; and yet,
he reflected, that if he was innocent of any evil design, it was
not right that he should be denied shelter. The commander had
given imperative orders that no one should unfasten the gates
after nightfall. So the sentinel adopted an artifice. He answered
that he would call Peterson, and, at the same moment opened and
closed the door. But he shut himself upon the outside, and remained
a few moments listening. Hearing nothing, he concluded it was
no risk to call the ranger. Accordingly he partly opened the door,
put his head in quickly, and said in a loud tone:</p>

<p>"Peterson, there is a man named Madison Drake out here who wants
to see you."</p>

<p>Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Peterson it could not
have startled him more. He was in the midst of a story, all life
and animation, when the gruff words of the sentinel broke in so
abruptly upon him. And yet it was not the words alone, but the
<em>name</em> pronounced that so affected him, for Jim Peterson
would have taken his solemn oath that that man was killed months
before. He was sure of it, and what could the sentinel mean by
breaking in upon them with such intelligence? He looked around
upon the faces all turned expectantly toward him, waiting for
the remainder of his story. He believed he must have been mistaken.</p>

<p>"What did that feller say?" he asked, looking half ashamed at
asking the question.</p>

<p>"He said there was a man named Drake who wanted to see you. What
makes you look so scared, Jim; I hope you don't owe him anything."</p>

<p>"Wal, by the eternal, that gits my time. Ef that man's alive,
then I'll swear that men don't die now-a-days unless they want
to."</p>

<p>"Why, what's up now?" asked Dingle.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember that name?" asked Peterson, turning towards
our hero.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking I had heard it somewhere."</p>

<p>"Wal, sir, he was on the flat-boat with me when all was killed
'cepting me. Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Peterson shook his head meaningly and slapped his hand upon his
knee as he uttered these words:</p>

<p>"Like enough it's him," said Dingle, "Freeze me to death, if
you can tell what's goin' to happen now-a-days."</p>

<p>"It may be a decoy of McGable," added the commander. "It is unnecessary
to caution you, Peterson. Nevertheless, I will accompany you."</p>

<p>The two went out on the platform. The wind was so strong as to
nearly lift them off their feet, and the darkness so great that
they barely discerned the form of the sentinel beside them.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked the commander.</p>

<p>"He will speak in a minute."</p>

<p>They listened, and finally the suffering man called out:</p>

<p>"Hello there, sentinel; hain't Peterson come out yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, here I am; what do you want?" replied and asked the ranger.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, Peterson? Don't you remember Madison Drake
who was on the flat-boat with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but the one I knowed war <em>killed</em> that night. Be
you him?"</p>

<p>"I am he. I was not killed, although well-nigh so. But, if you
will not admit me, I will not live long, as I am nearly perished
now."</p>

<p>"Have patience, Drake, a few minutes and I will see about it."</p>

<p>"Do you believe he is not trying to deceive us?" asked the commander,
in a low tone.</p>

<p>"That's his voice &mdash;I'd swear to it 'mong ten thousand.
But I'll swear, too, that he has been <em>killed</em> once!"</p>

<p>"Fudge! Jim, you ain't such a fool as that? Go down and let him
in, if you ain't afraid. Remember what I said and be careful."</p>

<p>The ranger, without a word, turned and made his way downward.
As he passed out toward the gate, it was not without considerable
misgivings and a hearty wish that matters and things in general
would not take it into their head to assume such mysterious and
inexplicable a form to him. He had no fear of anything mortal,
but he would have rather faced a dozen yelling Shawnees than the
ghostly apparition which he believed was waiting for him upon
the outside.</p>

<p>"Where'n thunder ar' you?" he demanded spitefully as he approached
the gate.</p>

<p>"Here, just on the outside, half chilled to death," was the reply
from the rattling teeth of the sufferer.</p>

<p>"Sure there ain't no reds about as ar' goin' to try to dodge
in atween your legs?"</p>

<p>"No, no; and in Heaven's name, how much longer are you going
to keep me here?"</p>

<p>"Wal, you needn't be so cross 'bout it."</p>

<p>With these words, Peterson cautiously unbarred the gate, and
opened a small space. Instantly, a cold, wet skeleton-apparition
glided through and stood trembling beside him.</p>

<p>"How are you, Jim? You don't appear glad to see me," it said,
pushing a cold, bony hand toward him.</p>

<p>"Just wait&mdash;wait till I fasten this gate and then I'll go up
to the block-house with you," replied the ranger, working at the
massive bolts, and at the same time, glancing furtively over his
shoulder, at what he believed to be a veritable ghost beside him.</p>

<p>"Now, give us your hand, Jim, for, if ever a white man was glad
to see another, I am glad to see you: Jeh-u-u-u! <em>ain't</em>
it cold?" exclaimed the apparition desperately, as a regular spasmodic
shock shook him, and apparently ejected the words in a most unceremonious
hurry from his rattling teeth. Peterson could not refuse the proffered
hand; but, as he took it, he felt a cold chill crawl, from the
finger ends of the ghost, up through his arms, clean to the crown
of his head where it seemed to halt, gather in a big mass, and
then separating into a number of arrowy needles, shoot through
every part of his system, even contracting his very toes.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;<em>how'r</em> yer&mdash;'tis cold&mdash;let's go in," he said, turning
toward the block-house, and walking hurriedly away.</p>

<p>We should like to know whether any of our readers have been in
a situation, where their greatest desire has been to get ahead
as fast as possible, and yet they felt ashamed to either look
behind them, or to increase their gait. If they have, they can
appreciate the peculiar sensations of the really brave-hearted
Peterson. Imagine yourself, on a dark night, when within a few
rods of your own door, where you know your friends are peering
into the darkness in expectation of your momentary arrival&mdash;we
say imagine that, just at that moment, you hear a footfall behind
you! You start and your heart commences to throb, and you hastily
debate whether it is best to walk unconcernedly along, as though
such a thing as fear never entered your head, or to glance behind
you, and break into a regular run for the door. But ridicule,
more potent than fear, prevents you, and you walk, it is true,
a little faster, but as you push open the door, you cannot help
shoving yourself in rather hurriedly, as your friends judge.</p>

<p>It was with feelings somewhat similar to these, that Peterson
walked toward the block-house, his unwelcome visitor stalking
after him.</p>

<p>"H'yer we is," he exclaimed, as he ushered him into the warm
glowing room of the block-house, where the hardy backwoodsmen
sat conversing.</p>

<p>"A dismal night, gentlemen," said Drake, bowing to the men, and
approaching the fire, against which he turned his back and gazed
composedly at the men. "A reg'lar snorter this night is; thought
I'd freeze to death. Jeh-u-u-u! that fire feels good. But I can't
blame you for your tardiness and suspicion in such times as these.
Though Mad Anthony has taught the Indians manners, it seems that
they forget them once in a while."</p>

<p>The hunters were not men to sit silent and unsocial when a stranger
claimed their hospitality. They saw it was no ghost, but a veritable
flesh and blood human being who stood before them. He was a tall,
cadaverous-looking man, his face all hair and eyes, and yet his
voice showed him to be a good-natured gentleman. His garments
were soaked with water, which slowly dropped from his ragged shirt,
and every turn of his clothes, and steamed constantly from them
on account of his proximity to the fire. He was without weapons
of any kind. Without waiting as long as it has taken us to introduce
this description, the commander replied:</p>

<p>"A cold and dismal night indeed. Let me give you something to
warm you within, for it is plain you need it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Drake, taking the proffered cup of raw whiskey
and swallowing it. "No more, thank you. I feel considerably better
now."</p>

<p>"Why, Drake, that <em>is</em> you," suddenly exclaimed Peterson;
"give us your hand and tell us how you are getting along."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! has it taken you all this time to discover my identity?
I thought you acted strangely when you admitted me into the gate."</p>

<p>"I own up, Mat, I took you for a <em>spook</em>, and it goes
hard yet to think as how it is <em>you</em> standin' thar lookin'
so jolly, when the last I seed of you, you had knocked under.
Come, you've got warmed up a little, let's hear how it was."</p>

<p>"Well. I will."</p>

<p>And thereupon, the new-comer related his experience, which may
be summed up briefly, as follows:</p>

<p>This Madison Drake, as the reader has probably suspected, was
one of the number on the flat-boat, whose sad fate was related
at the commencement of this work. When the Shawnees made their
rush upon it, he, with all the rest, was too bewildered to offer
the slightest resistance. He remembered seeing Peterson spring
overboard, and attempted to follow him; but he was not soon enough
to escape a terrible blow from an Indian's tomahawk. As he descended
into the water, his wound rendered him perfectly crazy, and, without
knowing it, he swam in to the Ohio shore. Here he was immediately
seized by several savages, who made no attempt to offer him further
injury. After the massacre was completed, the Indians assembled
upon the bank, and the others then noticed his presence. But,
instead of killing him, a strange whim possessed them to spare
his life. He was too frightened to utter a complaint about the
horrible wound in his back, as he knew it would be relieved only
by death. They traveled all night and most of the next day without
halting. After a time, they reached the Shawnee towns in the Sciota
Valley, where he had remained a prisoner until the day before.
An opportunity had then offered of escaping, which he instantly
seized. He knew the location of the settlement and made all haste
toward it, where, as shown, he effected his arrival.</p>

<p>All listened breathlessly to this recital. Before he had fairly
finished, Peterson asked:</p>

<p>"Are you the only one, Mat, 'ceptin' me that got off?"</p>

<p>"I am the only one."</p>

<p>"Are you sure? Did you ever hear anything of Marian?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I am the only person the Indians took from that boat."</p>

<p>"But, I follered them that night and part of the next day, and
I didn't see nothin' of you, and you might seen nothin' of her."</p>

<p>"Our party just after starting, separated and did not reunite
until just before we reached the Shawnee towns. You followed the
wrong one. You might easily have done this, as both parties were
large. No; do not hope that Marian or <em>any one</em> besides
us had escaped, I could not have helped knowing it."</p>

<p>"That settles the matter, then," said the commander, "we will
tell Abbot, in the morning. Poor man! I pity him and his wife."</p>

<p>"Is he here?" asked Drake, "I do pity him then; it was a hard
blow for him."</p>

<p>"But, I have heard," continued the commander, who saw that Mansfield
was painfully affected, "that there was a female captive among
them."</p>

<p>"Yes; there was one; but she was captured from a settler on the
Virginia frontier. Poor creature! she died long ago from her sufferings.
But, friends, you will excuse me I trust. I have had a hard run
for freedom; and, if you have no objections, I will now turn in
for the night."</p>

<p>"Certainly; let me help you to another snifter, to make you sleep
soundly."</p>

<p>Drake did not refuse the offered drink. At it was now late, the
sentinel was called in, another sent to take his place, and those
within stretched themselves out upon the floor, where, wrapped
in their blankets, they were soon oblivious to external things.</p>

<p>All excepting Mansfield, who sat listening to the howling wind
without, and gazing into the glowing embers with feelings which
we shall not attempt to describe.</p>

<p>When the morning broke, the slumberers were astir. The storm
cleared off toward daybreak, and the sun came out bright and cold.
Mansfield, who had not slept one moment, arose and took himself
toward Abbot's house with a heavy, painful heart. Deeming that
it would be a relief to his wife to hear his intelligence, he
introduced it before them both, stating what Drake had said and
that there could now be no room for further hope. It would be
presumption, they all felt, to entertain the slightest hope that
Marian could still be living.</p>

<p>"I have cherished no hope of again seeing her on earth," said
the mother. "I thank my heavenly Father that I am satisfied now
that she was killed outright. I have nothing now to do but to
wait until He calls me to rejoin her."</p>

<p>"Let us go patiently at work, dear wife," said Abbot. "It is
a relief to know that she was killed at once. It was a bitter
cup for us to drink, but we have swallowed the bitterest portion.
I thank God for this intelligence. And, you, Russel, is this a
relief to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he faintly answered, turning his head away.</p>

<p>And so the hope which had been exhumed and fanned into a feeble
life died again and was now reburied.</p>

<p>The expedition of search by the rangers for Marian, of course
was now given up. It was still their determination to capture
McGable, but the attempt was reluctantly deferred until a few
months later, when it was rightly judged the caution of the renegade
would be worn off, and an opportunity would present itself.</p>

<p>It was decided by a number of settlers to spend most of the time
in the wood, felling trees. It was necessary to collect a large
quantity of fuel,&mdash;besides it was in contemplation to erect one
or two cabins. This was one of the duties, devolving upon the
settlement, which was always dangerous, and yet one that must
be done sooner or later.</p>

<p>So, a company of men numbering over a dozen, including Abbot,
Mansfield, and Peterson, passed through the gate, across the clearing,
each bearing a rifle and an ax. It was quite early in the forenoon;
therefore they calculated upon doing a good day's work.</p>

<p>The spot selected for their operations, was three or four hundred
yards from the clearing. Here they stacked their rifles and scattered
themselves in such a manner, that the weapons would be safe from
the reach of any foe, and commenced their labors right merrily.
The clear ring of their axes, the fall of the trees like a rumble
of thunder, and the shout and song, could be heard at the block-house
and settlement.</p>

<p>They wrought vigorously until noon when they ceased, and seating
themselves upon the fallen trees, partook of the lunch they had
brought with them. They sat close together, joking and laughing,
their faces all aglow with good-humor and exercise. The meal was
finished, and several of the men had risen to recommence their
labors, when a crashing in the undergrowth was heard, and the
next moment the Frontier Angel burst in upon them, her arms outstretched,
her hair flying, her eyes all agleam, and her whole appearance
that of a raving lunatic.</p>

<p>"Quick! quick!" she exclaimed; "fly! he is coming! <em>he</em>
is coming with a lot of Indians! No&mdash;you can't reach the fort&mdash;they
are on that side of you! Take your guns quick! they are going
to kill you all!"</p>

<p>Hardly were her words finished, before each man had seized his
rifle, and stood waiting the orders of some one of their number.</p>

<p>"Get down between these two trees &mdash;I hear their tread!"
commanded Mansfield, whose ears, quickened to supernatural strength,
distinctly caught their tramp through the forest. "Hurry, boys,
they're here!"</p>

<p>At the same instant he bounded over the fallen tree beside him,
followed by all of the men, when, in a twinkling, they were so
disposed that nothing but their heads and rifle-barrels were visible.
Then, as they looked for the foe, they saw with horror that the
Frontier Angel was still standing as if transfixed upon the same
spot where she had uttered her warning.</p>

<p>"Fly, for God's sake!" exclaimed Mansfield, springing to his
feet, and excitedly waving his hand toward her. "Fly, for your
life, Frontier Angel! There they come!"</p>

<p>As he spoke she turned to flee, and, at the same moment, the
sharp crack of a rifle was heard. She gave a scream, swung her
arms wildly over her head and staggered further into the wood,
where she was concealed from view. The woodman had no time to
follow her, for immediately there was heard a rushing, and, as
the bushes parted, near a score of Indians, led by McGable, bounded
into the opening. As they caught sight of the settlers, they poured
a deadly volley in upon them, whose fearful effect was told by
more than one yell of agony.</p>

<p>"Now charge, boys!" exclaimed Mansfield, springing over the log
and dashing straight at the yelling savages. There was an electric
power in his words that thrilled every heart, and they charged
with such enthusiasm after their gallant leader, that it was irresistible.
The Indians were unprepared for any such movement. When nigh enough
to touch them with their gun-muzzles, every rifle of the whites
was discharged, and then swung over their heads.</p>

<p>"At them!" shouted Mansfield; "don't spare one!"</p>

<p>The rifles came down with murderous force, and, for a few moments,
one of the fiercest hand-to-hand contests raged. But the number
of the whites, after their discharge, was fully equal to the savages,
and their fury could not be withstood. The Indians, in a short
time, broke and scattered in the wood, and the panting whites
suddenly gazed into each other's faces as they saw there was no
foe left to encounter.</p>

<p>"Have they fled?" asked Mansfield, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Not one is left&mdash;all are killed or fled! Any of us slain?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I heard some one groan when we started."</p>

<p>The whites turned back to the logs where they had first sheltered
themselves; here they found two of their number dead, both having
received a bullet through the brain, while several others had
been given severe cuts.</p>

<p>A moment after, a dozen more men arrived from the block-house.
They had heard the firing in the wood, and had been instantly
dispatched by the commander; but their help was not needed, as
not a foe was left, so signal had been the repulse. But, for the
timely warning of the Frontier Angel, a most fearful massacre
must have taken place. Several of the settlers picked up the two
dead men and carried them to the settlement, as the commander
had instructed them to return the minute they could. Mansfield,
Peterson, Dingle, and Jenkins (the latter having come with the
reinforcement) remained behind. Four Shawnees lay doubled up in
death, while a fifth was rolling, and clutching, and flinging
the leaves in his agony. Shortly, to the relief of all, death
put him out of his misery.</p>

<p>"Who was killed?" asked Peterson.</p>

<p>"Smith and Thompson," replied Mansfield.</p>

<p>"Both single men; it is good for them that they have no women
or children to mourn 'em. We've straightened out five of <em>them</em>,
besides hacking a few more. By gracious, isn't that McGable h'yer?
Ef I didn't hit him, then I'll never shoot agin," asked Peterson.</p>

<p>"He appears to have escaped. What is to be done with these dead
Indians?"</p>

<p>"Why, leave 'em h'yer for the varmint, after we raises thar ha'r."</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name, Peterson, you are not going to do that?"</p>

<p>"I reckon I is. Eh, Dick?"</p>

<p>"In course, we must have their top-knots," replied Dingle, producing
his hunting-knife.</p>

<p>"You are as much a savage as they are," said Mansfield, turning
his back upon the sickening scene.</p>

<p>The two rangers were not to be deterred from scalping the Indians,
although they had enough respect for the feelings of Mansfield,
to go through the disgusting operation without their usual remark
and braggadocio.</p>

<p>"They'd 've been glad to 've done that same thing for us," said
Peterson.</p>

<p>"Freeze me," said Dingle, "if I don't believe thar is more of
'em round h'yer. S'posen we take a look? Jenkins, look through
the bushes thar by you."</p>

<p>All, including Mansfield, now commenced searching the wood to
see whether any of their number had crawled away to die in secret.
Jenkins had beat about but a few minutes, when he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Come here, quick! there's somebody under this bush! Just hear
him groan!"</p>

<p>All hastened thither; and, as Dingle pulled aside the bush, the
white, ghastly face of the renegade McGable was seen turned toward
them.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd give you your last sickness," said Peterson, with
a shocking want of feeling.</p>

<p>"Oh! let me alone, I am dying!" wailed the miserable wretch.</p>

<p>All feelings except pity left the heart of Mansfield, as he saw
the poor man in his last moments. He hastily ran back, and, seizing
an ax, cut away the bushes around him, so that the air could reach
him. It was then seen that he had received the bullet of Peterson
in his side. He was leaning upon his elbow, spitting blood, while
his hands closed rigidly over the wound, and the blood oozed through
them and pattered upon the leaves beneath.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you?" asked Mansfield, kneeling down beside
him and opening his hunting-shirt.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I can't live long. I deserve to die, but I don't want
to. I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused as the blood in his throat choked him. Peterson and
Dingle were both touched by his misery, and silently withdrew,
followed shortly by Jenkins. Mansfield saw that he was alone,
and determined to do his duty to the dying man.</p>

<p>"McGable, you are dying, it is true. Put away now all thoughts
of this world, and turn your heart toward the hereafter. Your
sins are great, but there is a God whose mercy is sufficient for
everything."</p>

<p>"Do not talk of God and mercy to me," said the man with a look
so full of horrible torment, that Mansfield shuddered to his very
soul. "The day of mercy has passed with me. A thousand years could
not atone for the crimes I have committed. If you can forgive
me, Mansfield&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I forgive you all, and so does Abbot&mdash;fear nothing of that."</p>

<p>"I have harmed you and him more than you have dreamed. Oh! this
wound! Can you not stay the flow?"</p>

<p>McGable removed his hand as he spoke, and before Mansfield could
stanch it, such a quantity of blood spouted forth, that the miserable
man fainted. The forgiving man bandaged it as well as he was able,
and presently the sufferer revived.</p>

<p>"I have harmed you more than you suspect," he said, faintly,
turning his dark eyes, all woe and misery, to him.</p>

<p>"You have not. What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"<em>Marian!</em>"</p>

<p>"How?&mdash;what? &mdash;McGable, you will not refuse me now."</p>

<p>"Mansfield, in a few minutes, you will have seen a monster die.
Let me adjure you to remember it to your last breath. The pain
of my wound is nothing to what I suffer in spirit. The awful torment
is unutterable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what of Marian?" gently reminded Mansfield.</p>

<p>"Marian is&mdash;" muttered the man dropping his head back on Mansfield's
arm and gasping for breath, "<em>Marian was not killed on the
flat-boat that night!</em>"</p>

<p>"What do you say?" fairly shrieked our hero, believing that his
mind was wandering.</p>

<p>"<em>Marian was not killed that night!&mdash;but I killed her! &mdash;I
see her angel face now! &mdash;Oh! is this death?</em>"</p>

<p>The renegade McGable was dead!</p>
