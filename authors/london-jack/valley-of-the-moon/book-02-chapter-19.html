<P>
Between feeding and caring for Billy, doing the housework, making
plans, and selling her store of pretty needlework, the days flew
happily for Saxon. Billy's consent to sell her pretties had been
hard to get, but at last she succeeded in coaxing it out of him.
<P>
"It's only the ones I haven't used," she urged; "and I can always
make more when we get settled somewhere."
<P>
What she did not sell, along with the household linen and hers
and Billy's spare clothing, she arranged to store with Tom.
<P>
"Go ahead," Billy said. "This is your picnic. What you say goes.
You're Robinson Crusoe an' I'm your man Friday. Make up your mind
yet which way you're goin' to travel?"
<P>
Saxon shook her head.
<P>
"Or how?"
<P>
She held up one foot and then the other, encased in stout walking
shoes which she had begun that morning to break in about the
house. Shank's mare, eh?"
<P>
"It's the way our people came into the West," she said proudly.
<P>
"It'll be regular trampin', though," he argued. "An' I never
heard of a woman tramp."
<P>
"Then here's one. Why, Billy, there's no shame in tramping. My
mother tramped most of the way across the Plains. And 'most
everybody else's mother tramped across in those days. I don't
care what people will think. I guess our race has been on the
tramp since the beginning of creation, just like we'll be,
looking for a piece of land that looked good to settle down on."
<P>
After a few days, when his scalp was sufficiently healed and the
bone-knitting was nicely in process, Billy was able to be up and
about. He was still quite helpless, however, with both his arms
in splints.
<P>
Doctor Hentley not only agreed, but himself suggested, that his
bill should wait against better times for settlement. Of
government land, in response to Saxon's eager questioning, he
knew nothing, except that he had a hazy idea that the days of
government land were over.
<P>
Tom, on the contrary, was confident that there was plenty of
government hand. He talked of Honey Lake, of Shasta County, and
of Humboldt.
<P>
"But you can't tackle it at this time of year, with winter comin'
on," he advised Saxon. "The thing for you to do is head south for
warmer weather--say along the coast. It don't snow down there. I
tell you what you do. Go down by San Jose and Salinas an' come
out on the coast at Monterey. South of that you'll find
government land mixed up with forest reserves and Mexican
rancheros. It's pretty wild, without any roads to speak of. All
they do is handle cattle. But there's some fine redwood canyons,
with good patches of farming ground that run right down to the
ocean. I was talkin' last year with a fellow that's been all
through there. An' I'd a-gone, like you an' Billy, only Sarah
wouldn't hear of it. There's gold down there, too. Quite a bunch
is in there prospectin', an' two or three good mines have opened.
But that's farther along and in a ways from the coast. You might
take a look."
<P>
Saxon shook her head. "We're not looking for gold but for
chickens and a place to grow vegetables. Our folks had all the
chance for gold in the early days, and what have they got to show
for it?"
<P>
"I guess you're right," Tom conceded. "They always played too big
a game, an' missed the thousand little chances right under their
nose. Look at your pa. I've heard him tell of selling three
Market street lots in San Francisco for fifty dollars each.
They're worth five  hundred thousand right now. An' look at Uncle
Will. He had ranches till the cows come home. Satisfied? No. He
wanted to be a cattle king, a regular Miller and Lux. An' when he
died he was a night watchman in Los Angeles at forty dollars a
month. There's a spirit of the times, an' the spirit of the times
has changed. It's all big business now, an' we're the small
potatoes. Why, I've heard our folks talk of livin' in the Western
Reserve. That was all around what's Ohio now. Anybody could get a
farm them days. All they had to do was yoke their oxen an' go
after it, an' the Pacific Ocean thousands of miles to the west,
an' all them thousands of miles an' millions of farms just
waitin' to be took up. A hundred an' sixty acres? Shucks. In the
early days in Oregon they talked six hundred an' forty acres.
That was the spirit of them times--free land, an' plenty of it.
But when we reached the Pacific Ocean them times was ended. Big
business begun; an' big business means big business men; an'
every big business man means thousands of little men without any
business at all except to work for the big ones. They're the
losers, don't you see? An' if they don't like it they can lump
it, but it won't do them no good. They can't yoke up their oxen
an' pull on. There's no place to pull on. China's over there, an'
in between's a mighty lot of salt water that's no good for
farmin' purposes."
<P>
"That's all clear enough," Saxon commented.
<P>
"Yes," her brother went on. "We can all see it after it's
happened, when it's too late."
<P>
"But the big men were smarter," Saxon remarked.
<P>
"They were luckier," Tom contended. "Some won, but most lost, an'
just as good men lost. It was almost like a lot of boys
scramblin' on the sidewalk for a handful of small change. Not
that some didn't have far-seein'. But just take your pa, for
example. He come of good Down East stock that's got business
instinct an' can add to what it's got. Now suppose your pa had
developed a weak heart, or got kidney disease, or caught
rheumatism, so he couldn't go gallivantin' an' rainbow chasin',
an' fightin' an' explorin' all over the West. Why, most likely
he'd a settled down in San Francisco--he'd a-had to--an' held
onto them three Market street lots, an' bought more lots, of
course, an' gone into steamboat companies, an' stock gamblin',
an' railroad buildin', an' Comstock-tunnelin'.
<P>
"Why, he'd a-become big business himself. I know 'm. He was the
most energetic man I ever saw, think quick as a wink, as cool as
an icicle an' as wild as a Comanche. Why, he'd a-cut a swath
through the free an' easy big business gamblers an' pirates of
them days; just as he cut a swath through the hearts of the
ladies when he went gallopin' past on that big horse of his,
sword clatterin', spurs jinglin', his long hair fiyin', straight
as an Indian, clean-built an' graceful as a blue-eyed prince out
of a fairy book an' a Mexican caballero all rolled into one; just
as he cut a swath through the Johnny Rebs in Civil War days,
chargin' with his men all the way through an' back again, an'
yellin' like a wild Indian for more. Cady, that helped raise you,
told me about that. Cady rode with your pa.
<P>
"Why, if your pa'd only got laid up in San Francisco, he would
a-ben one of the big men of the West. An' in that case, right
now, you'd be a rich young woman, travelin' in Europe, with a
mansion on Nob Hill along with the Floods and Crockers, an'
holdin' majority stock most likely in the Fairmount Hotel an' a
few little concerns like it. An' why ain't you? Because your pa
wasn't smart? No. His mind was like a steel trap. It's because he
was filled to burstin' an' spillin' over with the spirit of the
times; because he was full of fire an' vinegar an' couldn't set
down in one place. That's all the difference between you an' the
young women right now in the Flood and Crocker families. Your
father didn't catch rheumatism at the right time, that's all."
<P>
Saxon sighed, then smiled.
<P>
"Just the same, I've got them beaten," she said. "The Miss Floods
and Miss Crockers can't marry prize-fighters, and I did."
<P>
Tom looked at her, taken aback for the moment, with admiration,
slowly at first, growing in his face.
<P>
"Well, all I got to say," he enunciated solemnly, "is that
Billy's so lucky he don't know how lucky he is."
<P>
<P>
Not until Doctor Hentley gave the word did the splints come off
Billy's arms, and Saxon insisted upon an additional two weeks'
delay so that no risk would be run. These two weeks would
complete another month's rent, and the landlord had agreed to
wait payment for the last two months until Billy was on his feet
again.
<P>
Salinger's awaited the day set by Saxon for taking back their
furniture. Also, they had returned to Billy seventy-five dollars.
<P>
"The rest you've paid will be rent," the collector told Saxon.
"And the furniture's second hand now, too. The deal will be a
loss to Salinger's' and they didn't have to do it, either; you
know that. So just remember they've been pretty square with you,
and if you start over again don't forget them."
<P>
Out of this sum, and out of what was realized from Saxon's
pretties, they were able to pay all their small bills and yet
have a few dollars remaining in pocket.
<P>
"I hate owin' things worse 'n poison," Billy said to Saxon. "An'
now we don't owe a soul in this world except the landlord an' Doc
Hentley."
<P>
"And neither of them can afford to wait longer than they have
to," she said.
<P>
"And they won't," Billy answered quietly.
<P>
She smiled her approval, for she shared with Billy his horror of
debt, just as both shared it with that early tide of pioneers
with a Puritan ethic, which had settled the West.
<P>
Saxon timed her opportunity when Billy was out of the house to
pack the chest of drawers which had crossed the Atlantic by
sailing ship and the Plains by ox team. She kissed the bullet
hole in it, made in the fight at Little Meadow, as she kissed her
father's sword, the while she visioned him, as she always did,
astride his roan warhorse. With the old religious awe, she pored
over her mother's poems in the scrap-book, and clasped her
mother's red satin Spanish girdle about her in a farewell
embrace. She unpacked the scrap-book in order to gaze a last time
at the wood engraving of the Vikings, sword in hand, leaping upon
the English sands. Again she identified Billy as one of the
Vikings, and pondered for a space on the strange wanderings of
the seed from which she sprang. Always had her race been
land-hungry, and she took delight in believing she had bred true;
for had not she, despite her life passed in a city, found this
same land-hunger in her? And was she not going forth to satisfy
that hunger, just as her people of old time had done, as her
father and mother before her? She remembered her mother's tale of
how the promised land looked to them as their battered wagons and
weary oxen dropped down through the early winter snows of the
Sierras to the vast and flowering sun-land of California: In
fancy, herself a child of nine, she looked down from the snowy
heights as her mother must have looked down. She recalled and
repeated aloud one of her mother's stanzas:
<P>
"'Sweet as a wind-lute's airy strains
Your gentle muse has learned to sing
And California's boundless plains
Prolong the soft notes echoing.'"
<P>
She sighed happily and dried her eyes. Perhaps the hard times
were past. Perhaps they had constituted HER Plains, and she and
Billy had won safely across and were even then climbing the
Sierras ere they dropped down into the pleasant valley land.
<P>
Salinger's wagon was at the house, taking out the furniture, the
morning they left. The landlord, standing at the gate, received
the keys, shook hands with them, and wished them luck. "You're
goin' at it right," he congratulated them. "Sure an' wasn't it
under me roll of blankets I tramped into Oakland meself forty
year ago! Buy land, like me, when it's cheap. It'll keep you from
the poorhouse in your old age. There's plenty of new towns
springin' up. Get in on the ground floor. The work of your
hands'll keep you in food an' under a roof, an' the lend 'll make
you well to do. An' you know me address. When you can spare send
me along that small bit of rent. An' good luck. An' don't mind
what people think. 'Tis them that looks that finds."
<P>
Curious neighbors peeped from behind the blinds as Billy and
Saxon strode up the street, while the children gazed at them in
gaping astonishment. On Billy's back, inside a painted canvas
tarpaulin, was slung the roll of bedding. Inside the roll were
changes of underclothing and odds and ends of necessaries.
Outside, from the lashings, depended a frying pan and cooking
pail. In his hand he carried the coffee pot. Saxon carried a
small telescope basket protected by black oilcloth, and across
her back was the tiny ukulele case.
<P>
"We must look like holy frights," Billy grumbled, shrinking from
every gaze that was bent upon him.
<P>
"It'd be all right, if we were going camping," Saxon consoled.
"Only we're not."
<P>
"But they don't know that," she continued. "It's only you know
that, and what you think they're thinking isn't what they're
thinking at all. Most probably they think we're going camping.
And the best of it is we are going camping. We are! We are!"
<P>
At this Billy cheered up, though he muttered his firm intention
to knock the block off of any guy that got fresh. He stole a
glance at Saxon. Her cheeks were red, her eyes glowing.
<P>
"Say," he said suddenly. "I seen an opera once, where fellows
wandered over the country with guitars slung on their backs just
like you with that strummy-strum. You made me think of them. They
was always singin' songs."
<P>
"That's what I brought it along for," Saxon answered.
<P>
"And when we go down country roads we'll sing as we go along, and
we'll sing by the campfires, too. We're going camping, that's
all. Taking a vacation and seeing the country. So why shouldn't
we have a good time? Why, we don't even know where we're going to
sleep to-night, or any night. Think of the fun!"
<P>
"It's a sporting proposition all right, all right," Billy
considered. "But, just the same, let's turn off an' go around the
block. There's some fellows I know, standin' up there on the next
corner, an' I don't want to knock THEIR blocks off."
