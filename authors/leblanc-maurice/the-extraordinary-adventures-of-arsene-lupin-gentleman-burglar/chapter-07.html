<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>At three o’clock in the morning, there were still half a dozen
carriages in front of one of those small houses which form only
the side of the boulevard Berthier. The door of that house opened,
and a number of guests, male and female, emerged. The majority
of them entered their carriages and were quickly driven away,
leaving behind only two men who walked down Courcelles, where
they parted, as one of them lived in that street. The other decided
to return on foot as far as the Porte-Maillot. It was a beautiful
winter’s night, clear and cold; a night on which a brisk walk
is agreeable and refreshing.</p>

<p>But, at the end of a few minutes, he had the disagreeable impression
that he was being followed. Turning around, he saw a man skulking
amongst the trees. He was not a coward; yet he felt it advisable
to increase his speed. Then his pursuer commenced to run; and
he deemed it prudent to draw his revolver and face him. But he
had no time. The man rushed at him and attacked him violently.
Immediately, they were engaged in a desperate struggle, wherein
he felt that his unknown assailant had the advantage. He called
for help, struggled, and was thrown down on a pile of gravel,
seized by the throat, and gagged with a handkerchief that his
assailant forced into his mouth. His eyes closed, and the man
who was smothering him with his weight arose to defend himself
against an unexpected attack. A blow from a cane and a kick from
a boot; the man uttered two cries of pain, and fled, limping and
cursing. Without deigning to pursue the fugitive, the new arrival
stooped over the prostrate man and inquired:</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, monsieur?"</p>

<p>He was not injured, but he was dazed and unable to stand. His
rescuer procured a carriage, placed him in it, and accompanied
him to his house on the avenue de la Grande-Armée. On his arrival
there, quite recovered, he overwhelmed his saviour with thanks.</p>

<p>"I owe you my life, monsieur, and I shall not forget it. I do
not wish to alarm my wife at this time of night, but, to-morrow,
she will be pleased to thank you personally. Come and breakfast
with us. My name is Ludovic Imbert. May I ask yours?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, monsieur."</p>

<p>And he handed Mon. Imbert a card bearing the name: "Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>At that time, Arsène Lupin did not enjoy the celebrity which
the Cahorn affair, his escape from the Prison de la Santé, and
other brilliant exploits, afterwards gained for him. He had not
even used the name of Arsène Lupin. The name was specially invented
to designate the rescuer of Mon. Imbert; that is to say, it was
in that affair that Arsène Lupin was baptized. Fully armed and
ready for the fray, it is true, but lacking the resources and
authority which command success, Arsène Lupin was then merely
an apprentice in a profession wherein he soon became a master.</p>

<p>With what a thrill of joy he recalled the invitation he received
that night! At last, he had reached his goal! At last, he had
undertaken a task worthy of his strength and skill! The Imbert
millions! What a magnificent feast for an appetite like his!</p>

<p>He prepared a special toilet for the occasion; a shabby frock-coat,
baggy trousers, a frayed silk hat, well-worn collar and cuffs,
all quite correct in form, but bearing the unmistakable stamp
of poverty. His cravat was a black ribbon pinned with a false
diamond. Thus accoutred, he descended the stairs of the house
in which he lived at Montmartre. At the third floor, without stopping,
he rapped on a closed door with the head of his cane. He walked
to the exterior boulevards. A tram-car was passing. He boarded
it, and some one who had been following him took a seat beside
him. It was the lodger who occupied the room on the third floor.
A moment later, this man said to Lupin:</p>

<p>"Well, governor?"</p>

<p>"Well, it is all fixed."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I am going there to breakfast."</p>

<p>"You breakfast&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Why not? I rescued Mon. Ludovic Imbert from certain
death at your hands. Mon. Imbert is not devoid of gratitude. He
invited me to breakfast."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. Then the other said:</p>

<p>"But you are not going to throw up the scheme?"</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said Lupin, "When I arranged that little case
of assault and battery, when I took the trouble at three o’clock
in the morning, to rap you with my cane and tap you with my boot
at the risk of injuring my only friend, it was not my intention
to forego the advantages to be gained from a rescue so well arranged
and executed. Oh! no, not at all."</p>

<p>"But the strange rumors we hear about their fortune?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that. For six months, I have worked on this
affair, investigated it, studied it, questioned the servants,
the money-lenders and men of straw; for six months, I have shadowed
the husband and wife. Consequently, I know what I am talking about.
Whether the fortune came to them from old Brawford, as they pretend,
or from some other source, I do not care. I know that it is a
reality; that it exists. And some day it will be mine."</p>

<p>"Bigre! One hundred millions!"</p>

<p>"Let us say ten, or even five&mdash;that is enough! They have a safe
full of bonds, and there will be the devil to pay if I can’t get
my hands on them."</p>

<p>The tram-car stopped at the Place de l’Etoile. The man whispered
to Lupin:</p>

<p>"What am I to do now?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, at present. You will hear from me. There is no hurry."</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Arsène Lupin was ascending the magnificent
flight of stairs in the Imbert mansion, and Mon. Imbert introduced
him to his wife. Madame Gervaise Imbert was a short plump woman,
and very talkative. She gave Lupin a cordial welcome.</p>

<p>"I desired that we should be alone to entertain our saviour,"
she said.</p>

<p>From the outset, they treated "our saviour" as an old and valued
friend. By the time dessert was served, their friendship was well
cemented, and private confidences were being exchanged. Arsène
related the story of his life, the life of his father as a magistrate,
the sorrows of his childhood, and his present difficulties. Gervaise,
in turn, spoke of her youth, her marriage, the kindness of the
aged Brawford, the hundred millions that she had inherited, the
obstacles that prevented her from obtaining the enjoyment of her
inheritance, the moneys she had been obliged to borrow at an exorbitant
rate of interest, her endless contentions with Brawford’s nephews,
and the litigation! the injunctions! in fact, everything!</p>

<p>"Just think of it, Monsieur Lupin, the bonds are there, in my
husband’s office, and if we detach a single coupon, we lose everything!
They are there, in our safe, and we dare not touch them."</p>

<p>Monsieur Lupin shivered at the bare idea of his proximity to
so much wealth. Yet he felt quite certain that Monsieur Lupin
would never suffer from the same difficulty as his fair hostess
who declared she dare not touch the money.</p>

<p>"Ah! they are there!" he repeated, to himself; "they are there!"</p>

<p>A friendship formed under such circumstances soon led to closer
relations. When discreetly questioned, Arsène Lupin confessed
his poverty and distress. Immediately, the unfortunate young man
was appointed private secretary to the Imberts, husband and wife,
at a salary of one hundred francs a month. He was to come to the
house every day and receive orders for his work, and a room on
the second floor was set apart as his office. This room was directly
over Mon. Imbert’s office.</p>

<p>Arsène soon realized that his position as secretary was essentially
a sinecure. During the first two months, he had only four important
letters to recopy, and was called only once to Mon. Imbert’s office;
consequently, he had only one opportunity to contemplate, officially,
the Imbert safe. Moreover, he noticed that the secretary was not
invited to the social functions of the employer. But he did not
complain, as he preferred to remain, modestly, in the shade and
maintain his peace and freedom.</p>

<p>However, he was not wasting any time. From the beginning, he
made clandestine visits to Mon. Imbert’s office, and paid his
respects to the safe, which was hermetically closed. It was an
immense block of iron and steel, cold and stern in appearance,
which could not be forced open by the ordinary tools of the burglar’s
trade. But Arsène Lupin was not discouraged.</p>

<p>"Where force fails, cunning prevails," he said to himself. "The
essential thing is to be on the spot when the opportunity occurs.
In the meantime, I must watch and wait."</p>

<p>He made immediately some preliminary preparations. After careful
soundings made upon the floor of his room, he introduced a lead
pipe which penetrated the ceiling of Mon. Imbert’s office at a
point between the two screeds of the cornice. By means of this
pipe, he hoped to see and hear what transpired in the room below.</p>

<p>Henceforth, he passed his days stretched at full length upon
the floor. He frequently saw the Imberts holding a consultation
in front of the safe, investigating books and papers. When they
turned the combination lock, he tried to learn the figures and
the number of turns they made to the right and left. He watched
their movements; he sought to catch their words. There was also
a key necessary to complete the opening of the safe. What did
they do with it? Did they hide it?</p>

<p>One day, he saw them leave the room without locking the safe.
He descended the stairs quickly, and boldly entered the room.
But they had returned.</p>

<p>"Oh! excuse me," he said, "I made a mistake in the door."</p>

<p>"Come in, Monsieur Lupin, come in," cried Madame Imbert, "are
you not at home here? We want your advice. What bonds should we
sell? The foreign securities or the government annuities?"</p>

<p>"But the injunction?" said Lupin, with surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh! it doesn’t cover all the bonds."</p>

<p>She opened the door of the safe and withdrew a package of bonds.
But her husband protested.</p>

<p>"No, no, Gervaise, it would be foolish to sell the foreign bonds.
They are going up, whilst the annuities are as high as they ever
will be. What do you think, my dear friend?"</p>

<p>The dear friend had no opinion; yet he advised the sacrifice
of the annuities. Then she withdrew another package and, from
it, she took a paper at random. It proved to be a three-per-cent
annuity worth two thousand francs. Ludovic placed the package
of bonds in his pocket. That afternoon, accompanied by his secretary,
he sold the annuities to a stock-broker and realized forty-six
thousand francs.</p>

<p>Whatever Madame Imbert might have said about it, Arsène Lupin
did not feel at home in the Imbert house. On the contrary, his
position there was a peculiar one. He learned that the servants
did not even know his name. They called him "monsieur." Ludovic
always spoke of him in the same way: "You will tell monsieur.
Has monsieur arrived?" Why that mysterious appellation?</p>

<p>Moreover, after their first outburst of enthusiasm, the Imberts
seldom spoke to him, and, although treating him with the consideration
due to a benefactor, they gave him little or no attention. They
appeared to regard him as an eccentric character who did not like
to be disturbed, and they respected his isolation as if it were
a stringent rule on his part. On one occasion, while passing through
the vestibule, he heard Madame Imbert say to the two gentlemen:</p>

<p>"He is such a barbarian!"</p>

<p>"Very well," he said to himself, "I am a barbarian."</p>

<p>And, without seeking to solve the question of their strange conduct,
he proceeded with the execution of his own plans. He had decided
that he could not depend on chance, nor on the negligence of Madame
Imbert, who carried the key of the safe, and who, on locking the
safe, invariably scattered the letters forming the combination
of the lock. Consequently, he must act for himself.</p>

<p>Finally, an incident precipitated matters; it was the vehement
campaign instituted against the Imberts by certain newspapers
that accused the Imberts of swindling. Arsène Lupin was present
at certain family conferences when this new vicissitude was discussed.
He decided that if he waited much longer, he would lose everything.
During the next five days, instead of leaving the house about
six o’clock, according to his usual habit, he locked himself in
his room. It was supposed that he had gone out. But he was lying
on the floor surveying the office of Mon. Imbert. During those
five evenings, the favorable opportunity that he awaited did not
take place. He left the house about midnight by a side door to
which he held the key.</p>

<p>But on the sixth day, he learned that the Imberts, actuated by
the malevolent insinuations of their enemies, proposed to make
an inventory of the contents of the safe.</p>

<p>"They will do it to-night," thought Lupin.</p>

<p>And truly, after dinner, Imbert and his wife retired to the office
and commenced to examine the books of account and the securities
contained in the safe. Thus, one hour after another passed away.
He heard the servants go upstairs to their rooms. No one now remained
on the first floor. Midnight! The Imberts were still at work.</p>

<p>"I must get to work," murmured Lupin.</p>

<p>He opened his window. It opened on a court. Outside, everything
was dark and quiet. He took from his desk a knotted rope, fastened
it to the balcony in front of his window, and quietly descended
as far as the window below, which was that of the of Imbert’s
office. He stood upon the balcony for a moment, motionless, with
attentive ear and watchful eye, but the heavy curtains effectually
concealed the interior of the room. He cautiously pushed on the
double window. If no one had examined it, it ought to yield to
the slightest pressure, for, during the afternoon, he had so fixed
the bolt that it would not enter the staple.</p>

<p>The window yielded to his touch. Then, with infinite care, he
pushed it open sufficiently to admit his head. He parted the curtains
a few inches, looked in, and saw Mon. Imbert and his wife sitting
in front of the safe, deeply absorbed in their work and speaking
softly to each other at rare intervals.</p>

<p>He calculated the distance between him and them, considered the
exact movements he would require to make in order to overcome
them, one after the other, before they could call for help, and
he was about to rush upon them, when Madame Imbert said:</p>

<p>"Ah! the room is getting quite cold. I am going to bed. And you,
my dear?"</p>

<p>"I shall stay and finish."</p>

<p>"Finish! Why, that will take you all night."</p>

<p>"Not at all. An hour, at the most."</p>

<p>She retired. Twenty minutes, thirty minutes passed. Arsène pushed
the window a little farther open. The curtains shook. He pushed
once more. Mon. Imbert turned, and, seeing the curtains blown
by the wind, he rose to close the window.</p>

<p>There was not a cry, not the trace of struggle. With a few precise
moments, and without causing him the least injury, Arsène stunned
him, wrapped the curtain about his head, bound him hand and foot,
and did it all in such a manner that Mon. Imbert had no opportunity
to recognize his assailant.</p>

<p>Quickly, he approached the safe, seized two packages that he
placed under his arm, left the office, and opened the servants’
gate. A carriage was stationed in the street.</p>

<p>"Take that, first&mdash;and follow me," he said to the coachman. He
returned to the office, and, in two trips, they emptied the safe.
Then Arsène went to his own room, removed the rope, and all other
traces of his clandestine work.</p>

<p>A few hours later, Arsène Lupin and his assistant examined the
stolen goods. Lupin was not disappointed, as he had foreseen that
the wealth of the Imberts had been greatly exaggerated. It did
not consist of hundreds of millions, nor even tens of millions.
Yet it amounted to a very respectable sum, and Lupin expressed
his satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, "there will be a considerable loss when
we come to sell the bonds, as we will have to dispose of them
surreptitiously at reduced prices. In the meantime, they will
rest quietly in my desk awaiting a propitious moment."</p>

<p>Arsène saw no reason why he should not go to the Imbert house
the next day. But a perusal of the morning papers revealed this
startling fact: Ludovic and Gervaise Imbert had disappeared.</p>

<p>When the officers of the law seized the safe and opened it, they
found there what Arsène Lupin had left&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>Such are the facts; and I learned the sequel to them, one day,
when Arsène Lupin was in a confidential mood. He was pacing to
and fro in my room, with a nervous step and a feverish eye that
were unusual to him.</p>

<p>"After all," I said to him, "it was your most successful venture."</p>

<p>Without making a direct reply, he said:</p>

<p>"There are some impenetrable secrets connected with that affair;
some obscure points that escape my comprehension. For instance:
What caused their flight? Why did they not take advantage of the
help I unconsciously gave them? It would have been so simple to
say: ‘The hundred millions were in the safe. They are no longer
there, because they have been stolen.’"</p>

<p>"They lost their nerve."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is it&mdash;they lost their nerve...On the other hand,
it is true&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What is true?"</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing."</p>

<p>What was the meaning of Lupin’s reticence? It was quite obvious
that he had not told me everything; there was something he was
loath to tell. His conduct puzzled me. It must indeed be a very
serious matter to cause such a man as Arsène Lupin even a momentary
hesitation. I threw out a few questions at random.</p>

<p>"Have you seen them since?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And have you never experienced the slightest degree of pity
for those unfortunate people?"</p>

<p>"I!" he exclaimed, with a start.</p>

<p>His sudden excitement astonished me. Had I touched him on a sore
spot? I continued:</p>

<p>"Of course. If you had not left them alone, they might have been
able to face the danger, or, at least, made their escape with
full pockets."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he said, indignantly. "I suppose you have
an idea that my soul should be filled with remorse?"</p>

<p>"Call it remorse or regrets&mdash;anything you like&#11834;"</p>

<p>"They are not worth it."</p>

<p>"Have you no regrets or remorse for having stolen their fortune?"</p>

<p>"What fortune?"</p>

<p>"The packages of bonds you took from their safe."</p>

<p>"Oh! I stole their bonds, did I? I deprived them of a portion
of their wealth? Is that my crime? Ah! my dear boy, you do not
know the truth. You never imagined that those bonds were not worth
the paper they were written on. Those bonds were false&mdash;they were
counterfeit&mdash;every one of them&mdash;do you understand? <em>THEY WERE
COUNTERFEIT</em>!"</p>

<p>I looked at him, astounded.</p>

<p>"Counterfeit! The four or five millions?"</p>

<p>"Yes, counterfeit!" he exclaimed, in a fit of rage. "Only so
many scraps of paper! I couldn’t raise a sou on the whole of them!
And you ask me if I have any remorse. <em>They</em> are the ones
who should have remorse and pity. They played me for a simpleton;
and I fell into their trap. I was their latest victim, their most
stupid gull!"</p>

<p>He was affected by genuine anger&mdash;the result of malice and wounded
pride. He continued:</p>

<p>"From start to finish, I got the worst of it. Do you know the
part I played in that affair, or rather the part they made me
play? That of André Brawford! Yes, my boy, that is the truth,
and I never suspected it. It was not until afterwards, on reading
the newspapers, that the light finally dawned in my stupid brain.
Whilst I was posing as his "saviour," as the gentleman who had
risked his life to rescue Mon. Imbert from the clutches of an
assassin, they were passing me off as Brawford. Wasn’t that splendid?
That eccentric individual who had a room on the second floor,
that barbarian that was exhibited only at a distance, was Brawford,
and Brawford was I! Thanks to me, and to the confidence that I
inspired under the name of Brawford, they were enabled to borrow
money from the bankers and other money-lenders. Ha! what an experience
for a novice! And I swear to you that I shall profit by the lesson!"</p>

<p>He stopped, seized my arm, and said to me, in a tone of exasperation:</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, at this very moment, Gervaise Imbert owes me
fifteen hundred francs."</p>

<p>I could not refrain from laughter, his rage was so grotesque.
He was making a mountain out of a molehill. In a moment, he laughed
himself, and said:</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy, fifteen hundred francs. You must know that I had
not received one sou of my promised salary, and, more than that,
she had borrowed from me the sum of fifteen hundred francs. All
my youthful savings! And do you know why? To devote the money
to charity! I am giving you a straight story. She wanted it for
some poor people she was assisting&mdash;unknown to her husband. And
my hard-earned money was wormed out of me by that silly pretense!
Isn’t it amusing, hein? Arsène Lupin done out of fifteen hundred
francs by the fair lady from whom he stole four millions in counterfeit
bonds! And what a vast amount of time and patience and cunning
I expended to achieve that result! It was the first time in my
life that I was played for a fool, and I frankly confess that
I was fooled that time to the queen’s taste!"</p>
