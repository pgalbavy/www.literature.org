<p>Smith sauntered out to the terrace, looked at the sky, sniffed
the roses, and sat down in the shadow of a cherry tree, cocking
his feet up and resting his novel on his knees. Several hours
later, aroused by the mellow clash of harness and noise of wheels,
he looked out over the terrace wall just in time to catch a glimpse
of the victoria of his neighbour, gold and green livery, strawberry
roans, flashing wheels and all; and quite alone under her brilliant
sunshade, the dark-haired girl whom Kingsbury had decided to marry
as soon as he could arrange to fall in love with her.</p>

<p>"I fancy she's the Countess, all right," mused Smith; "but, to
me, the girl with red hair is vastly&mdash;more&mdash;more alluring&#11834;"</p>

<p>The sound of wheels again broke the thread of his sleepy meditation;
their dog-cart was at the gate; and presently he perceived Kingsbury,
hatted and gloved to perfection, get in, take the reins from the
coachman, loop his whip, assume the posture popularly attributed
to pupils of Howlett, and go whirling away through the lazy sunshine
of a perfect Belgian afternoon.</p>

<p>"The beast has lunched without me," muttered Smith, yawning and
looking at his watch. Then he got up, stretched, tinkled the bell,
and when the doll-faced maid arrived, requested an omelet Ã  la
Semois and a bottle of claret.</p>

<p>He got it in due time, absorbed it lazily, casting a weatherwise
eye on the sky at intervals with a view to afternoon fishing;
but the sun was too bright; besides, his book had become interesting
in a somewhat maudlin fashion, inasmuch as the lovers must come
to a clinch in the next chapter or not at all.</p>

<p>"You can't tell in modern novels," he muttered; "a girl has a
way of side-stepping just as the bell rings: but the main guy
ought to make good within the next page or two. If he doesn't
he's a dub!"</p>

<p>With which comment he sought his hammock for an hour's needed
repose; but he had slumbered longer than that when he found himself
sitting bolt upright, the telephone bell ringing in his ears.</p>

<p>Comfortably awake now, he slid from the hammock, and, entering
the house, stepped into the smoking-room.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he said, unhooking the receiver.</p>

<p>Kingsbury's voice replied: "I'm here in Semois-les-Bains, at
the charity bazar. Can you distinguish what I say?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, my Romeo! Proceed."</p>

<p>"I'm in a fix. Our Ambassador didn't come, and I don't know anybody
to take me over and present me."</p>

<p>"Buy a doll, idiot!"</p>

<p>"Confound it, I've already bought ten! That doesn't give me the
privilege of doing anything but buying ten more. She's busy; about
five million people are crowding around her."</p>

<p>"Buy every doll she has! Put her out of business, man! Then if
you can't fix it somehow you're a cuckoo. Is the Countess the
dark-haired girl?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Isn't she here selling dolls? Didn't the paper say she was going
to?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but hadn't you better find out for certain before you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I am certain; anyway, I don't care. Smith, she is the most radiantly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"All right; ring off&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Wait! I wanted to tell you that she has the prettiest way of
smiling every time I buy a doll. And then, while she wraps up
the infernal thing in ribbons and tissue we chat a little. I'd
like to murder our Ambassador! Do you think that if I bought her
entire stock&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!"</p>

<p>"What do you think?"</p>

<p>"What you do."</p>

<p>"But I don't think anything at all. I am asking you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Try it, anyhow."</p>

<p>"All right. Hold the wire, Smith. I'll report progress&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What! Stand here and wait&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't be selfish. I'll return in a moment."</p>

<p>The "moment" stretched into a buzzing, crackling half hour, punctuated
by impatient inquiries from Central. Suddenly an excited: "Hello,
Smith!"</p>

<p>"Hello, you infernal&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I've done it! I've bought every doll! She's the sweetest thing;
I told her I had a plan for endowing a ward in any old hospital
she might name, and she thinks we ought to talk it over, so I'm
going to sit out on the terrace with her &mdash;Smith!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you'd gone! I only wanted to say that she is far,
far lovelier than I had supposed. I can't wait here talking with
you any longer. Good-by!"</p>

<p>"Is she the Countess?" shouted Smith incredulously. But Kingsbury
had rung off.</p>
