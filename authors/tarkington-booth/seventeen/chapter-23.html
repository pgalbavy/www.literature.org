<p>To the competent twenties, hundreds of miles suggesting no impossibilities,
such departures may be rending, but not tragic. Implacable, the
difference to Seventeen! Miss Pratt was going home, and Seventeen
could not follow; it could only mourn upon the lonely shore, tracing
little angelic footprints left in the sand.</p>

<p>To Seventeen such a departure is final; it is a vanishing.</p>

<p>And now it seemed possible that William might be deprived even
of the last romantic consolations: of the "last waltz together,"
of the last, last "listening to music in the moonlight together";
of all those sacred lasts of the "last evening together."</p>

<p>He had pleaded strongly for a "dress-suit" as a fitting recognition
of his seventeenth birthday anniversary, but he had been denied
by his father with a jocularity more crushing than rigor. Since
then&mdash;in particular since the arrival of Miss Pratt &mdash;Mr.
Baxter's temper had been growing steadily more and more even.
That is, as affected by William's social activities, it was uniformly
bad. Nevertheless, after heavy brooding, William decided to make
one final appeal before he resorted to measures which the necessities
of despair had caused him to contemplate.</p>

<p>He wished to give himself every chance for a good effect; therefore,
he did not act hastily, but went over what he intended to say,
rehearsing it with a few appropriate gestures, and even taking
some pleasure in the pathetic dignity of this performance, as
revealed by occasional glances at the mirror of his dressing-table.
In spite of these little alleviations, his trouble was great and
all too real, for, unhappily, the previous rehearsal of an emotional
scene does not prove the emotion insincere.</p>

<p>Descending, he found his father and mother still sitting upon
the front porch. Then, standing before them, solemn-eyed, he uttered
a preluding cough, and began:</p>

<p>"Father," he said in a loud voice, "I have come to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" Mrs. Baxter exclaimed, not perceiving that she was
interrupting an intended oration. "Willie, you DO look pale! Sit
down, poor child; you oughtn't to walk so much in this heat."</p>

<p>"Father," William repeated. "Fath&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose you got her safely home from church," Mr. Baxter said.
"She might have been carried off by footpads if you three boys
hadn't been along to take care of her!"</p>

<p>But William persisted heroically. "Father&mdash;" he said. "Father,
I have come to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What on earth's the matter with you?" Mr. Baxter ceased to fan
himself; Mrs. Baxter stopped rocking, and both stared, for it
had dawned upon them that something unusual was beginning to take
place.</p>

<p>William backed to the start and tried it again. "Father, I have
come to&mdash;" He paused and gulped, evidently expecting to be interrupted,
but both of his parents remained silent, regarding him with puzzled
surprise. "Father," he began once more, "I have come &mdash;I
have come to&mdash;to place before you something I think it's your
duty as my father to undertake, and I have thought over this step
before laying it before you."</p>

<p>"My soul!" said Mr. Baxter, under his breath. "My soul!"</p>

<p>"At my age," William continued, swallowing, and fixing his earnest
eyes upon the roof of the porch, to avoid the disconcerting stare
of his father&mdash;"at my age there's some things that ought to be
done and some things that ought not to be done. If you asked me
what I thought <em>OUGHT </em>to be done, there is only one answer:
When anybody as old as I am has to go out among other young men
his own age that already got one, like anyway half of them <em>HAVE,
</em>who I go with, and their fathers have already taken such
a step, because they felt it was the only right thing to do, because
at my age and the young men I go with's age, it IS the only right
thing to do, because that is something nobody could deny, at my
age&mdash;" Here William drew a long breath, and, deciding to abandon
that sentence as irrevocably tangled, began another: "I have thought
over this step, because there comes a time to every young man
when they must lay a step before their father before something
happens that they would be sorry for. I have thought this undertaking
over, and I am certain it would be your honest duty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My soul!" gasped Mr. Baxter. "I thought I knew you pretty well,
but you talk like a stranger to ME! What is all this? What you
<em>WANT</em>?"</p>

<p>"A dress-suit!" said William.</p>

<p>He had intended to say a great deal more before coming to the
point, but, although through nervousness he had lost some threads
of his rehearsed plea, it seemed to him that he was getting along
well and putting his case with some distinction and power. He
was surprised and hurt, therefore, to hear his father utter a
wordless shout in a tone of wondering derision.</p>

<p>"I have more to say&mdash;" William began.</p>

<p>But Mr. Baxter cut him off. "A dress-suit!" he cried. "Well,
I'm glad you were talking about <em>SOMETHING, </em>because I
honestly thought it must be too much sun!"</p>

<p>At this, the troubled William brought his eyes down from the
porch roof and forgot his rehearsal. He lifted his hand appealingly.
"Father," he said, "I <em>GOT </em>to have one!"</p>

<p>"'Got to'!" Mr. Baxter laughed a laugh that chilled the supplicant
through and through. "At your age I thought I was lucky if I had
<em>ANY </em>suit that was fit to be seen in. You're too young,
Willie. I don't want you to get your mind on such stuff, and if
I have my way, you won't have a dress-suit for four years more,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Father, I <em>GOT </em>to have one. I got to have one right
away!" The urgency in William's voice was almost tearful. "I don't
ask you to have it made, or to go to expensive tailors, but there's
plenty of good ready-made ones that only cost about forty dollars;
they're advertised in the paper. Father, wouldn't you spend just
forty dollars? I'll pay it back when I'm in business; I'll work&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter waved all this aside. "It's not the money. It's the
principle that I'm standing for, and I don't intend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Father, <em>WON'T </em>you do it?"</p>

<p>"No, I will not!"</p>

<p>William saw that sentence had been passed and all appeals for
a new trial denied. He choked, and rushed into the house without
more ado.</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" his mother said.</p>

<p>"Poor boy nothing!" fumed Mr. Baxter. "He's about lost his mind
over that Miss Pratt. Think of his coming out here and starting
a regular debating society declamation before his mother and father!
Why, I never heard anything like it in my life! I don't like to
hurt his feelings, and I'd give him anything I could afford that
would do him any good, but all he wants it for now is to splurge
around in at this party before that little yellow-haired girl!
I guess he can wear the kind of clothes most of the other boys
wear&mdash;the kind <em>I</em> wore at parties&mdash;and never thought of
wearing anything else. What's the world getting to be like? Seventeen
years old and throws a fit because he can't have a dress-suit!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter looked thoughtful. "But&mdash;but suppose he felt he couldn't
go to the dance unless he wore one, poor boy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All the better," said Mr. Baxter, firmly. "Do him good to keep
away and get his mind on something else."</p>

<p>"Of course," she suggested, with some timidity, "forty dollars
isn't a great deal of money, and a ready-made suit, just to begin
with&mdash;"</p>

<p>Naturally, Mr. Baxter perceived whither she was drifting. "Forty
dollars isn't a thousand," he interrupted, "but what you want
to throw it away for? One reason a boy of seventeen oughtn't to
have evening clothes is the way he behaves with <em>ANY </em>clothes.
Forty dollars! Why, only this summer he sat down on Jane's open
paint-box, twice in one week!"</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;Miss Pratt IS going away, and the dance will be
her last night. I'm afraid it would really hurt him to miss it.
I remember once, before we were engaged&mdash;that evening before papa
took me abroad, and you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's no use, mamma," he said. "We were both in the twenties&mdash;why,
<em>I</em> was six years older than Willie, even then. There's
no comparison at all. I'll let him order a dress-suit on his twenty-first
birthday and not a minute before. I don't believe in it, and I
intend to see that he gets all this stuff out of his system. He's
got to learn some hard sense!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter shook her head doubtfully, but she said no more.
Perhaps she regretted a little that she had caused Mr. Baxter's
evening clothes to be so expansively enlarged&mdash;for she looked
rather regretful. She also looked rather incomprehensible, not
to say cryptic, during the long silence which followed, and Mr.
Baxter resumed his rocking, unaware of the fixity of gaze which
his wife maintained upon him&mdash;a thing the most loyal will do sometimes.</p>

<p>The incomprehensible look disappeared before long; but the regretful
one was renewed in the mother's eyes whenever she caught glimpses
of her son, that day, and at the table, where William's manner
was gentle&mdash;even toward his heartless father.</p>

<p>Underneath that gentleness, the harried self of William was no
longer debating a desperate resolve, but had fixed upon it, and
on the following afternoon Jane chanced to be a witness of some
resultant actions. She came to her mother with an account of them.</p>

<p>"Mamma, what you s'pose Willie wants of those two ole market-baskets
that were down cellar?"</p>

<p>"Why, Jane?"</p>

<p>"Well, he carried 'em in his room, an' then he saw me lookin';
an' he said, 'G'way from here!' an' shut the door. He looks so
funny! What's he want of those ole baskets, mamma?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Perhaps he doesn't even know, himself, Jane."</p>

<p>But William did know, definitely. He had set the baskets upon
chairs, and now, with pale determination, he was proceeding to
fill them. When his task was completed the two baskets contained:</p>

<p>One "heavy-weight winter suit of clothes."</p>

<p>One "light-weight summer suit of clothes."</p>

<p>One cap.</p>

<p>One straw hat.</p>

<p>Two pairs of white flannel trousers.</p>

<p>Two Madras shirts.</p>

<p>Two flannel shirts.</p>

<p>Two silk shirts.</p>

<p>Seven soft collars.</p>

<p>Three silk neckties.</p>

<p>One crocheted tie.</p>

<p>Eight pairs of socks.</p>

<p>One pair of patent-leather shoes.</p>

<p>One pair of tennis-shoes.</p>

<p>One overcoat.</p>

<p>Some underwear.</p>

<p>One two-foot shelf of books, consisting of several sterling works
upon mathematics, in a damaged condition; five of Shakespeare's
plays, expurgated for schools and colleges, and also damaged;
a work upon political economy, and another upon the science of
physics; Webster's Collegiate Dictionary; How to Enter a Drawing-Room
and Five Hundred Other Hints; Witty Sayings from Here and There;
Lorna Doone; Quentin Durward; The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,
a very old copy of Moths, and a small Bible.</p>

<p>William spread handkerchiefs upon the two over-bulging cargoes,
that their nature might not be disclosed to the curious, and,
after listening a moment at his door, took the baskets, one upon
each arm, then went quickly down the stairs and out of the house,
out of the yard, and into the alley&mdash;by which route he had modestly
chosen to travel.</p>

<p>... After an absence of about two hours he returned empty-handed
and anxious. "Mother, I want to speak to you," he said, addressing
Mrs Baxter in a voice which clearly proved the strain of these
racking days. "I want to speak to you about something important."</p>

<p>"Yes, Willie?"</p>

<p>"Please send Jane away. I can't talk about important things with
a child in the room."</p>

<p>Jane naturally wished to stay, since he was going to say something
important. "Mamma, do I <em>HAF </em>to go?"</p>

<p>"Just a few minutes, dear."</p>

<p>Jane walked submissively out of the door, leaving it open behind
her. Then, having gone about six feet farther, she halted and,
preserving a breathless silence, consoled herself for her banishment
by listening to what was said, hearing it all as satisfactorily
as if she had remained in the room. Quiet, thoughtful children,
like Jane, avail themselves of these little pleasures oftener
than is suspected.</p>

<p>"Mother," said William, with great intensity, "I want to ask
you please to lend me three dollars and sixty cents."</p>

<p>"What for, Willie?"</p>

<p>"Mother, I just ask you to lend me three dollars and sixty cents."</p>

<p>"But what <em>FOR</em>?"</p>

<p>"Mother, I don't feel I can discuss it any; I simply ask you:
Will you lend me three dollars and sixty cents?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter laughed gently. "I don't think I could, Willie, but
certainly I should want to know what for."</p>

<p>"Mother, I am going on eighteen years of age, and when I ask
for a small sum of money like three dollars and sixty cents I
think I might be trusted to know how to use it for my own good
without having to answer questions like a ch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, Willie," she exclaimed, "you ought to have plenty of money
of your own!"</p>

<p>"Of course I ought," he agreed, warmly. "If you'd ask father
to give me a regular allow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no; I mean you ought to have plenty left out of that old
junk and furniture I let you sell last month. You had over nine
dollars!'</p>

<p>"That was five weeks ago," William explained, wearily.</p>

<p>"But you certainly must have some of it left. Why, it was <em>MORE
</em>than nine dollars, I believe! I think it was nearer ten.
Surely you haven't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ye gods!" cried the goaded William. "A person going on eighteen
years old ought to be able to spend nine dollars in five weeks
without everybody's acting like it was a crime! Mother, I ask
you the simple question: Will you <em>PLEASE </em>lend me three
dollars and sixty cents?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I ought to, dear. I'm sure your father wouldn't
wish me to, unless you'll tell me what you want it for. In fact,
I won't consider it at all unless you do tell me."</p>

<p>"You won't do it?" he quavered.</p>

<p>She shook her head gently. "You see, dear, I'm afraid the reason
you don't tell me is because you know that I wouldn't give it
to you if I knew what you wanted it for."</p>

<p>This perfect diagnosis of the case so disheartened him that after
a few monosyllabic efforts to continue the conversation with dignity
he gave it up, and left in such a preoccupation with despondency
that he passed the surprised Jane in the hall without suspecting
what she had been doing.</p>

<p>That evening, after dinner, he addressed to his father an impassioned
appeal for three dollars and sixty cents, laying such stress of
pathos on his principal argument that if he couldn't have a dress-suit,
at least he ought to be given three dollars and sixty <em>CENTS
(</em>the emphasis is William's) that Mr. Baxter was moved in
the direction of consent&mdash;but not far enough. "I'd like to let
you have it, Willie," he said, excusing himself for refusal, "but
your mother felt <em>SHE </em>oughtn't to do it unless you'd say
what you wanted it for, and I'm sure she wouldn't like me to do
it. I can't let you have it unless you get her to say she wants
me to."</p>

<p>Thus advised, the unfortunate made another appeal to his mother
the next day, and, having brought about no relaxation of the situation,
again petitioned his father, on the following evening. So it went;
the torn and driven William turning from parent to parent; and
surely, since the world began, the special sum of three dollars
and sixty cents has never been so often mentioned in any one house
and in the same space of time as it was in the house of the Baxters
during Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of that oppressive
week.</p>

<p>But on Friday William disappeared after breakfast and did not
return to lunch.</p>
