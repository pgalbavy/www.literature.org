<p>"To horse!" said the Emperor.
</p><p>He corrected himself, on seeing the magnificent ass which they brought
him:
</p><p>"To donkey, rather! Waldemar, are you sure this animal is quiet to ride
and drive?"
</p><p>"I will answer for him as I would for myself, Sire," declared the count.
</p><p>"In that case, I feel safe," said the Emperor, laughing. And, turning to
the officers with him, "Gentlemen, to horse!"
</p><p>The market-place of the village of Capri was crowded with sight-seers,
kept back by a line of Italian carabiniers, and, in the middle, all the
donkeys of the place, which had been requisitioned to enable the Emperor
to go over that island of wonders.
</p><p>"Waldemar," said the Emperor, taking the head of the cavalcade, "what do
we begin with?"
</p><p>"With Tiberius's Villa, Sire."
</p><p>They rode under a gateway and then followed a roughly-paved path, rising
gradually to the eastern promontory of the island.
</p><p>The Emperor laughed and enjoyed himself and good-humoredly chaffed the
colossal Count von Waldemar, whose feet touched the ground on either
side of the unfortunate donkey borne down under his weight.
</p><p>In three-quarters of an hour, they arrived first at Tiberius's Leap, an
enormous rock, a thousand feet high, from which the tyrant caused his
victims to be hurled into the sea. . . .
</p><p>The Emperor dismounted, walked up to the hand-rail and took a glance at
the abyss. Then he went on foot to the ruins of Tiberius's Villa, where
he strolled about among the crumbling halls and passages.
</p><p>He stopped for a moment.
</p><p>There was a glorious view of the point of Sorrento and over the whole
island of Capri. The glowing blue of the sea outlined the beautiful
curve of the bay; and cool perfumes mingled with the scent of the
citron-trees.
</p><p>"The view is finer still, Sire," said Waldemar, "from the hermit's
little chapel, at the summit."
</p><p>"Let us go to it."
</p><p>But the hermit himself descended by a steep path. He was an old man,
with a hesitating gait and a bent back. He carried the book in which
travellers usually write down their impressions.
</p><p>He placed the book on a stone seat.
</p><p>"What am I write?" asked the Emperor.
</p><p>"Your name, Sire, and the date of your visit . . . and anything you
please."
</p><p>The Emperor took the pen which the hermit handed him and bent down to
write.
</p><p>"Take care, Sire, take care!"
</p><p>Shouts of alarm . . . a great crash from the direction of the chapel.
. . . The Emperor turned round. He saw a huge rock come rolling down
upon him like a whirlwind.
</p><p>At the same moment, he was seized round the body by the hermit and flung
to a distance of ten yards away.
</p><p>The rock struck against the stone seat where the Emperor had been
standing a quarter of a second before and smashed the seat into
fragments. But for the hermit, the Emperor would have been killed.
</p><p>He gave him his hand and said, simply:
</p><p>"Thank you."
</p><p>The officers flocked round him.
</p><p>"It's nothing, gentlemen. . . . We have escaped with a fright . . .
though it was a fine fright, I confess. . . . All the same, but for the
intervention of this worthy man . . ."
</p><p>And, going up to the hermit:
</p><p>"What is your name, my friend?"
</p><p>The hermit had kept his head concealed in his hood. He pushed it back an
inch or so and, in a very low voice, so as to be heard by none but the
Emperor, he said:
</p><p>"The name of a man, Sire, who is very pleased that you have shaken him
by the hand."
</p><p>The Emperor gave a start and stepped back. Then, at once controlling
himself:
</p><p>"Gentlemen," he said to the officers, "I will ask you to go up to the
chapel. More rocks can break loose; and it would perhaps be wise to warn
the authorities of the island. You will join me later. I want to thank
this good man."
</p><p>He walked away, accompanied by the hermit. When they were alone, he
said:
</p><p>"You! Why?"
</p><p>"I had to speak to you, Sire. If I had asked for an audience . . . would
you have granted my request? I preferred to act directly and I intended
to make myself known while Your Imperial Majesty was signing the book,
when that stupid accident . . ."
</p><p>"Well?" said the Emperor.
</p><p>"The letters which I gave Waldemar to hand to you, Sire, are forgeries."
</p><p>The Emperor made a gesture of keen annoyance:
</p><p>"Forgeries? Are you sure?"
</p><p>"Absolutely sure, Sire."
</p><p>"Yet that Malreich . . ."
</p><p>"Malreich was not the culprit."
</p><p>"Then who was?"
</p><p>"I must beg Your Imperial Majesty to treat my answer as secret and
confidential. The real culprit was Mrs. Kesselbach."
</p><p>"Kesselbach's own wife?"
</p><p>"Yes, Sire. She is dead now. It was she who made or caused to be made
the copies which are in your possession. She kept the real letters."
</p><p>"But where are they?" exclaimed the Emperor. "That is the important
thing! They must be recovered at all costs! I attach the greatest value
to those letters. . . ."
</p><p>"Here they are, Sire."
</p><p>The Emperor had a moment of stupefaction. He looked at Lupin, looked at
the letters, then at Lupin again and pocketed the bundle without
examining it.
</p><p>Clearly, this man was puzzling him once more. Where did this scoundrel
spring from who, possessing so terrible a weapon, handed it over like
that, generously, unconditionally? It would have been so easy for him to
keep the letters and to make such use of them as he pleased! No, he had
given his promise and he was keeping his word.
</p><p>And the Emperor thought of all the astounding things which that man had
done.
</p><p>"The papers said that you were dead," he said.
</p><p>"Yes, Sire. In reality, I am dead. And the police of my country, glad to
be rid of me, have buried the charred and unrecognizable remains of my
body."
</p><p>"Then you are free?"
</p><p>"As I always have been."
</p><p>"And nothing attaches you to anything?"
</p><p>"Nothing, Sire."
</p><p>"In that case . . ."
</p><p>The Emperor hesitated and then, explicitly:
</p><p>"In that case, enter my service. I offer you the command of my private
police. You shall be the absolute master. You shall have full power,
even over the other police."
</p><p>"No, Sire."
</p><p>"Why not?"
</p><p>"I am a Frenchman."
</p><p>There was a pause. The Emperor was evidently pleased with the answer. He
said:
</p><p>"Still, as you say that no link attaches you . . ."
</p><p>"That is, one, Sire, which nothing can sever." And he added, laughing,
"I am dead as a man, but alive as a Frenchman. I am sure that Your
Imperial Majesty will understand."
</p><p>The Emperor took a few steps up and down. Then he said:
</p><p>"I should like to pay my debt, however. I heard that the negotiations
for the grand-duchy of Veldenz were broken off. . . ."
</p><p>"Yes, Sire, Pierre Leduc was an imposter. He is dead."
</p><p>"What can I do for you? You have given me back those letters. . . . You
have saved my life. . . . What can I do?"
</p><p>"Nothing, Sire."
</p><p>"You insist upon my remaining your debtor?"
</p><p>"Yes, Sire."
</p><p>The Emperor gave a last glance at that strange man who set himself up in
his presence as his equal. Then he bowed his head slightly and walked
away without another word.
</p><p>"Aha, Majesty, I've caught you this time!" said Lupin, following him
with his eyes. And, philosophically, "No doubt it's a poor revenge . . .
and would rather have recovered Alsace-Lorraine. . . . But still . . ."
</p><p>He interrupted himself and stamped his foot on the ground:
</p><p>"You confounded Lupin! Will you never change, will you always remain
hateful and cynical to the last moment of your existence? Be serious,
hang it all! The time has come, now or never, to be serious!"
</p><p>He climbed the path that leads to the chapel and stopped at the place
where the rock had broken loose. He burst out laughing:
</p><p>"It was a good piece of work and His Imperial Majesty's officers did not
know what to make of it. But how could they guess that I myself loosened
that rock, that, at the last moment, I gave the decisive blow of the
pick-axe and that the aforesaid rock rolled down the path which I had
made between it and . . . an emperor whose life I was bent on saving?"
</p><p>He sighed:
</p><p>"Ah, Lupin, what a complex mind you have! All that trouble because you
had sworn that this particular Majesty should shake you by the hand! A
lot of good it has done you! 'An Emperor's hand five fingers has, no
more,' as Victor Hugo might have said."
</p><p>He entered the chapel and, with a special key, opened the low door of a
little sacristy. On a heap of straw, lay a man, with his hands and legs
bound and a gag in his mouth.
</p><p>"Well, my friend, the hermit," said Lupin, "it wasn't so very long, was
it? Twenty-four hours at the most. . . . But I have worked jolly hard on
your behalf! Just think, you have saved the Emperor's life! Yes, old
chap. You are the man who saved the Emperor's life. I have made your
fortune, that's what I've done. They'll build a cathedral for you and
put up a statue to you when you're dead and gone. Here, take your
things."
</p><p>The hermit, nearly dead with hunger, staggered to his feet. Lupin
quickly put on his own clothes and said:
</p><p>"Farewell, O worthy and venerable man. Forgive me for this little upset.
And pray for me. I shall need it. Eternity is opening its gate wide to
me. Farewell."
</p><p>He stood for a few moments on the threshold of the chapel. It was the
solemn moment at which one hesitates, in spite of everything, before the
terrible end of all things. But his resolution was irrevocable and,
without further reflection, he darted out, ran down the slope, crossed
the level ground of Tiberius's Leap and put one leg over the hand-rail:
</p><p>"Lupin, I give you three minutes for play-acting. 'What's the good?' you
will say. 'There is nobody here.' Well . . . and what about you? Can't
you act your last farce for yourself? By Jove, the performance is worth
it. . . . <u>Arsène Lupin</u>, heroic comedy in eighty scenes. . . . The
curtain rises on the death-scene . . . and the principal part is played
by Lupin in person. . . . 'Bravo, Lupin!' . . . Feel my heart, ladies
and gentlemen . . . seventy beats to the minute. . . . And a smile on my
lips. . . . 'Bravo, Lupin! Oh, the rogue, what cheek he has!' . . .
Well, jump, my lord. . . . Are you ready? It's the last adventure, old
fellow. No regrets? Regrets? What for, heavens above? My life was
splendid. Ah, Dolores, Dolores, if you had not come into it, abominable
monster that you were! . . . . . . And you, Malreich, why did you not
speak? . . . And you, Pierre Leduc. . . . Here I am! . . . My three dead
friends, I am about to join you. . . . Oh, Geneviève, my dear Geneviève!
. . . Here, have you done, you old play-actor? . . . Right you are!
Right you are! I'm coming. . . ."
</p><p>He pulled his other leg over, looked down the abyss at the dark and
motionless sea and, raising his head:
</p><p>"Farewell, immortal and thrice-blessed nature! _Moriturus te salutat!_
Farewell, all that is beautiful on earth! Farewell, splendor of things.
Farewell, life!"
</p><p>He flung kisses to space, to the sky, to the sun. . . . Then, folding
his arms, he took the leap.
</p><hr/>
<p>Sidi-bel-Abbes. The barracks of the Foreign Legion. An adjutant sat
smoking and reading his newspaper in a small, low-ceilinged room.
</p><p>Near him, close to the window opening on the yard, two great devils of
non-commissioned officers were jabbering in guttural French, mixed with
Teutonic phrases.
</p><p>The door opened. Some one entered. It was a slightly-built man, of
medium height, smartly-dressed.
</p><p>The adjutant rose, glared angrily at the intruder and growled:
</p><p>"I say, what on earth is the orderly up to? . . . And you, sir, what do
you want?"
</p><p>"Service."
</p><p>This was said frankly, imperiously.
</p><p>The two non-coms burst into a silly laugh. The man looked at them
askance.
</p><p>"In other words, you wish to enlist in the Legion?" asked the adjutant.
</p><p>"Yes, but on one condition."
</p><p>"Conditions, by Jove! What conditions?"
</p><p>"That I am not left mouldering here. There is a company leaving for
Morocco. I'll join that."
</p><p>One of the non-coms gave a fresh chuckle and was heard to say:
</p><p>"The Moors are in for a bad time. The gentleman's enlisting."
</p><p>"Silence!" cried the man, "I don't stand being laughed at."
</p><p>His voice sounded harsh and masterful.
</p><p>The non-com, a brutal-looking giant, retorted:
</p><p>"Here, recruity, you'd better be careful how you talk to me, or . . ."
</p><p>"Or what?"
</p><p>"You'll get something you won't like, that's all!"
</p><p>The man went up to him, took him round the waist, swung him over the
ledge of the window and pitched him into the yard.
</p><p>Then he said to the other:
</p><p>"Go away."
</p><p>The other went away.
</p><p>The man at once returned to the adjutant and said:
</p><p>"Lieutenant, pray be so good as to tell the major that Don Luis
Perenna, a Spanish grandee and a Frenchman at heart, wishes to take
service in the Foreign Legion. Go, my friend."
</p><p>The flabbergasted adjutant did not move.
</p><p>"Go, my friend, and go at once. I have no time to waste."
</p><p>The adjutant rose, looked at his astounding visitor with a bewildered
eye and went out in the tamest fashion.
</p><p>Then Lupin lit a cigarette and, sitting down in the adjutant's chair,
said, aloud:
</p><p>"As the sea refused to have anything to say to me, or rather as I, at
the last moment, refused to have anything to say to the sea, we'll go
and see if the bullets of the Moors are more compassionate. And, in any
case, it will be a smarter finish. . . . Face the enemy, Lupin, and all
for France! . . ."
