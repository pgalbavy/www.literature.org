<P>
THE moments passed; the silence between us continued. Miss
Dunross made an attempt to rouse me.
<P>
"Have you decided to go back to Scotland with your friends at
Lerwick?" she asked.
<P>
"It is no easy matter," I replied, "to decide on leaving my
friends in this house."
<P>
Her head drooped lower on her bosom; her voice sunk as she
answered me.
<P>
"Think of your mother," she said. "The first duty you owe is your
duty to her. Your long absence is a heavy trial to her--your
mother is suffering."
<P>
"Suffering?" I repeated. "Her letters say nothing--"
<P>
"You forget that you have allowed me to read her letters," Miss
Dunross interposed. "I see the unwritten and unconscious
confession of anxiety in every line that she writes to you. You
know, as well as I do, that there is cause for her anxiety. Make
her happy by telling her that you sail for home with your
friends. Make her happier still by telling her that you grieve no
more over the loss of Mrs. Van Brandt. May I write it, in your
name and in those words?"
<P>
I felt the strangest reluctance to permit her to write in those
terms, or in any terms, of Mrs. Van Brandt. The unhappy
love-story of my manhood had never been a forbidden subject
between us on former occasions. Why did I feel as if it had
become a forbidden subject now? Why did I evade giving her a
direct reply?
<P>
"We have plenty of time before us," I said. "I want to speak to
you about yourself."
<P>
She lifted her hand in the obscurity that surrounded her, as if
to protest against the topic to which I had returned. I
persisted, nevertheless, in returning to it.
<P>
"If I must go back," I went on, "I may venture to say to you at
parting what I have not said yet. I cannot, and will not, believe
that you are an incurable invalid. My education, as I have told
you, has been the education of a medical man. I am well
acquainted with some of the greatest living physicians, in
Edinburgh as well as in London. Will you allow me to describe
your malady (as I understand it) to men who are accustomed to
treat cases of intricate nervous disorder? And will you let me
write and tell you the result?"
<P>
I waited for her reply. Neither by word nor sign did she
encourage the idea of any future communication with her. I
ventured to suggest another motive which might induce her to
receive a letter from me.
<P>
"In any case, I may find it necessary to write to you," I went
on. "You firmly believe that I and my little Mary are destined to
meet again. If your anticipations are realized, you will expect
me to tell you of it, surely?"
<P>
Once more I waited. She spoke--but it was not to reply: it was
only to change the subject.
<P>
"The time is passing," was all she said. "We have not begun your
letter to your mother yet."
<P>
It would have been cruel to contend with her any longer. Her
voice warned me that she was suffering. The faint gleam of light
through the parted curtains was fading fast. It was time, indeed,
to write the letter. I could find other opportunities of speaking
to her before I left the house.
<P>
"I am ready," I answered. "Let us begin."
<P>
The first sentence was easily dictated to my patient secretary. I
informed my mother that my sprained wrist was nearly restored to
use, and that nothing prevented my leaving Shetland when the
lighthouse commissioner was ready to return. This was all that it
was necessary to say on the subject of my health; the disaster of
my re-opened wound having been, for obvious reasons, concealed
from my mother's knowledge. Miss Dunross silently wrote the
opening lines of the letter, and waited for the words that were
to follow.
<P>
In my next sentence, I announced the date at which the vessel was
to sail on the return voyage; and I mentioned the period at which
my mother might expect to see me, weather permitting. Those
words, also, Miss Dunross wrote--and waited again. I set myself
to consider what I should say next. To my surprise and alarm, I
found it impossible to fix my mind on the subject. My thoughts
wandered away, in the strangest manner, from my letter to Mrs.
Van Brandt. I was ashamed of myself; I was angry with myself--I
resolved, no matter what I said, that I would positively finish
the letter. No! try as I might, the utmost effort of my will
availed me nothing. Mrs. Van Brandt's words at our last interview
were murmuring in my ears--not a word of my own would come to me!
<P>
Miss Dunross laid down her pen, and slowly turned her head to
look at me.
<P>
"Surely you have something more to add to your letter?" she said.
<P>
"Certainly," I answered. "I don't know what is the matter with
me. The effort of dictating seems to be beyond my power this
evening."
<P>
"Can I help you?" she asked.
<P>
I gladly accepted the suggestion. "There are many things," I
said, "which my mother would be glad to hear, if I were not too
stupid to think of them. I am sure I may trust your sympathy to
think of them for me."
<P>
That rash answer offered Miss Dunross the opportunity of
returning to the subject of Mrs. Van Brandt. She seized the
opportunity with a woman's persistent resolution when she has her
end in view, and is determined to reach it at all hazards.
<P>
"You have not told your mother yet," she said, "that your
infatuation for Mrs. Van Brandt is at an end. Will you put it in
your own words? Or shall I write it for you, imitating your
language as well as I can?"
<P>
In the state of my mind at that moment, her perseverance
conquered me. I thought to myself indolently, "If I say No, she
will only return to the subject again, and she will end (after
all I owe to her kindness) in making me say Yes." Before I could
answer her she had realized my anticipations. She returned to the
subject; and she made me say Yes.
<P>
"What does your silence mean?" she said. "Do you ask me to help
you, and do you refuse to accept the first suggestion I offer?"
<P>
"Take up your pen," I rejoined. "It shall be as you wish."
<P>
"Will you dictate the words?"
<P>
"I will try."
<P>
I tried; and this time I succeeded. With the image of Mrs. Van
Brandt vividly present to my mind, I arranged the first words of
the sentence which was to tell my mother that my "infatuation"
was at an end!
<P>
"You will be glad to hear," I began, "that time and change are
doing their good work."
<P>
Miss Dunross wrote the words, and paused in anticipation of the
next sentence. The light faded and faded; the room grew darker
and darker. I went on.
<P>
"I hope I shall cause you no more anxiety, my dear mother, on the
subject of Mrs. Van Brandt."
<P>
In the deep silence I could hear the pen of my secretary
traveling steadily over the paper while it wrote those words.
<P>
"Have you written?" I asked, as the sound of the pen ceased.
<P>
"I have written," she answered, in her customary quiet tones.
<P>
I went on again with my letter.
<P>
"The days pass now, and I seldom or never think of her; I hope I
am resigned at last to the loss of Mrs. Van Brandt."
<P>
As I reached the end of the sentence, I heard a faint cry from
Miss Dunross. Looking instantly toward her, I could just see, in
the deepening darkness, t hat her head had fallen on the back of
the chair. My first impulse was, of course, to rise and go to
her. I had barely got to my feet, when some indescribable dread
paralyzed me on the instant. Supporting myself against the
chimney-piece, I stood perfectly incapable of advancing a step.
The effort to speak was the one effort that I could make.
<P>
"Are you ill?" I asked.
<P>
She was hardly able to answer me; speaking in a whisper, without
raising her head.
<P>
"I am frightened," she said.
<P>
"What has frightened you?"
<P>
I heard her shudder in the darkness. Instead of answering me, she
whispered to herself: "What am I to say to him?"
<P>
"Tell me what has frightened you?" I repeated. "You know you may
trust me with the truth."
<P>
She rallied her sinking strength. She answered in these strange
words:
<P>
"Something has come between me and the letter that I am writing
for you."
<P>
"What is it?"
<P>
"I can't tell you."
<P>
"Can you see it?"
<P>
"No."
<P>
"Can you feel it?"
<P>
"Yes!"
<P>
"What is it like?"
<P>
"Like a breath of cold air between me and the letter."
<P>
"Has the window come open?"
<P>
"The window is close shut."
<P>
"And the door?"
<P>
"The door is shut also--as well as I can see. Make sure of it for
yourself. Where are you? What are you doing?"
<P>
I was looking toward the window. As she spoke her last words, I
was conscious of a change in that part of the room.
<P>
In the gap between the parted curtains there was a new light
shining; not the dim gray twilight of Nature, but a pure and
starry radiance, a pale, unearthly light. While I watched it, the
starry radiance quivered as if some breath of air had stirred it.
When it was still again, there dawned on me through the unearthly
luster the figure of a woman. By fine and slow gradations, it
became more and more distinct. I knew the noble figure; I knew
the sad and tender smile. For the second time I stood in the
presence of the apparition of Mrs. Van Brandt.
<P>
She was robed, not as I had last seen her, but in the dress which
she had worn on the memorable evening when we met on the
bridge--in the dress in which she had first appeared to me, by
the waterfall in Scotland. The starry light shone round her like
a halo. She looked at me with sorrowful and pleading eyes, as she
had looked when I saw the apparition of her in the summer-house.
She lifted her hand--not beckoning me to approach her, as before,
but gently signing to me to remain where I stood.
<P>
I waited--feeling awe, but no fear. My heart was all hers as I
looked at her.
<P>
She moved; gliding from the window to the chair in which Miss
Dunross sat; winding her way slowly round it, until she stood at
the back. By the light of the pale halo that encircled the
ghostly Presence, and moved with it, I could see the dark figure
of the living woman seated immovable in the chair. The
writing-case was on her lap, with the letter and the pen lying on
it. Her arms hung helpless at her sides; her veiled head was now
bent forward. She looked as if she had been struck to stone in
the act of trying to rise from her seat.
<P>
A moment passed--and I saw the ghostly Presence stoop over the
living woman. It lifted the writing-case from her lap. It rested
the writing-case on her shoulder. Its white fingers took the pen
and wrote on the unfinished letter. It put the writing-case back
on the lap of the living woman. Still standing behind the chair,
it turned toward me. It looked at me once more. And now it
beckoned--beckoned to me to approach.
<P>
Moving without conscious will of my own, as I had moved when I
first saw her in the summer-house--drawn nearer and nearer by an
irresistible power--I approached and stopped within a few paces
of her. She advanced and laid her hand on my bosom. Again I felt
those strangely mingled sensations of rapture and awe, which had
once before filled me when I was conscious, spiritually, of her
touch. Again she spoke, in the low, melodious tones which I
recalled so well. Again she said the words: "Remember me. Come to
me." Her hand dropped from my bosom. The pale light in which she
stood quivered, sunk, vanished. I saw the twilight glimmering
between the curtains--and I saw no more. She had spoken. She had
gone.
<P>
I was near Miss Dunross--near enough, when I put out my hand, to
touch her.
<P>
She started and shuddered, like a woman suddenly awakened from a
dreadful dream.
<P>
"Speak to me!" she whispered. "Let me know that it is _you_ who
touched me."
<P>
I spoke a few composing words before I questioned her.
<P>
"Have you seen anything in the room?"
<P>
She answered. "I have been filled with a deadly fear. I have seen
nothing but the writing-case lifted from my lap."
<P>
"Did you see the hand that lifted it?"
<P>
"No."
<P>
"Did you see a starry light, and a figure standing in it?"
<P>
"No."
<P>
"Did you see the writing-case after it was lifted from your lap?"
<P>
"I saw it resting on my shoulder."
<P>
"Did you see writing on the letter, which was not _your_
writing?"
<P>
"I saw a darker shadow on the paper than the shadow in which I am
sitting."
<P>
"Did it move?"
<P>
"It moved across the paper."
<P>
"As a pen moves in writing?"
<P>
"Yes. As a pen moves in writing."
<P>
"May I take the letter?"
<P>
She handed it to me.
<P>
"May I light a candle?"
<P>
She drew her veil more closely over her face, and bowed in
silence.
<P>
I lighted the candle on the mantel-piece, and looked for the
writing.
<P>
There, on the blank space in the letter, as I had seen it before
on the blank space in the sketch-book--there were the written
words which the ghostly Presence had left behind it; arranged
once more in two lines, as I copy them here:
<P>
At the month's end, In the shadow of Saint Paul's.
