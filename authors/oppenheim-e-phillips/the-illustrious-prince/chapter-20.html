<P>
Mr. Coulson moved his cigar into a corner of his mouth, as though
to obtain a clear view of his questioner's face. His expression
was one of bland interest.
<P>
"Well, I guess you've got me puzzled, Sir Edward," he said. "You
aren't thinking of doing anything in woollen machinery, are you?"
<P>
Sir Edward smiled.
<P>
"I think not, Mr. Coulson," he answered. "At any rate, my
question had nothing to do with your other very interesting
avocation. What I wanted to ask you was whether you could tell me
anything about a compatriot of yours--a Mr. Hamilton Fynes?"
<P>
"Hamilton Fynes!" Mr. Coulson repeated thoughtfully. "Why, that's
the man who got murdered on the cars, going from Liverpool to
London."
<P>
"That is so," Sir Edward admitted.
<P>
Mr. Coulson shook his head.
<P>
"I told that reporter fellow all I knew about him," he said. "He
was an unsociable sort of chap, you know, Sir Edward, and he
wasn't in any line of business."
<P>
"H'm! I thought he might have been," the Minister answered,
glancing keenly for a moment at his visitor. "To tell you the
truth, Mr. Coulson, we have been a great deal bothered about that
unfortunate incident, and by the subsequent murder of the young
man who was attached to your Embassy here. Scotland Yard has
strained every nerve to bring the guilty people to justice, but
so far unsuccessfully. It seems to me that your friends on the
other side scarcely seem to give us credit for our exertions.
They do not help us in the least. They assure us that they had no
knowledge of Mr. Fynes other than has appeared in the papers.
They recognize him only as an American citizen going about his
legitimate business. A little more confidence on their part
would, I think, render our task easier."
<P>
Mr. Coulson scratched his chin for a moment thoughtfully.
<P>
"Well," he said, "I can understand their feeling a bit sore about
it. I'm not exactly given to brag when I'm away from my own
country--one hears too much of that all the time--but between you
and me, I shouldn't say that it was possible for two crimes like
that to be committed in New York City and for the murderer to get
off scot free in either case."
<P>
"The matter," Sir Edward declared, "has given us a great deal of
anxiety, and I can assure you that the Home Secretary himself has
taken a strong personal interest in it, but at the same time, as
I have just pointed out to you, our investigations are rendered
the more difficult from the fact that we cannot learn anything
definite concerning this Mr. Hamilton Fynes or his visit to this
country. Now, if we knew, for instance," Sir Edward continued,
"that he was carrying documents, or even a letter, similar to the
one you have just handed to me, we might at once discover a
motive to the crime, and work backwards until we reached the
perpetrator."
<P>
Mr. Coulson knocked the ash from his cigar.
<P>
"I see what you are driving at," he said. "I am sorry I can be of
no assistance to you, Sir Edward."
<P>
"Neither in the case of Mr. Hamilton Fynes or in the case of Mr.
Richard Vanderpole?" Sir Edward asked.
<P>
Mr. Coulson shook his head.
<P>
"Quite out of my line," he declared.
<P>
"Notwithstanding the fact," Sir Edward reminded him quietly,
"that you were probably the last person to see Vanderpole alive?
He came to the Savoy to call upon you before he got into the
taxicab where he was murdered. That is so, isn't it?"
<P>
"Sure!" Mr. Coulson answered. "A nice young fellow he was, too.
Well set up, and real American manners,--Hail, fellow, well met!'
with you right away."
<P>
"I suppose, Mr. Coulson," the Minister suggested smoothly, "it
wouldn't answer your purpose to put aside that bluff about
patents for the development of the woollen trade for a few
moments, and tell me exactly what passed between you and Mr.
Vanderpole at the Savoy Hotel, and the object of his calling upon
you? Whether, for instance, he took away with him documents or
papers intended for the Embassy and which you yourself had
brought from America?"
<P>
"You do think of things!" Mr. Coulson remarked admiringly.
"You're on the wrong track this time, though, sure. Still,
supposing I were able to tell you that Mr. Vanderpole was
carrying papers of importance to my country, and that Mr.
Hamilton Fynes was also in possession of the same class of
document, how would it help you? In what fresh direction should
you look then for the murderers of these two men?"
<P>
"Mr. Coulson," Sir Edward said, "we should consider the nature of
those documents, and we should see to whose advantage it was that
they were suppressed."
<P>
Mr. Coulson's face seemed suddenly old and lined. He spoke with a
new vigor, and his eyes were very keen and bright under his bushy
eyebrows.
<P>
"And supposing it was your country's?" he asked. "Supposing they
contained instructions to our Ambassador which you might consider
inimical to your interests? Do you mean that you would look at
home for the murderer? You mean that you have men so devoted to
their native land that they were willing to run the risk of death
by the hangman to aid her? You mean that your Secret Service is
perfected to that extent, and that the scales of justice are held
blindfolded? Or do you mean that Scotland Yard would have its
orders, and that these men would go free?"
<P>
"I was not thinking of my own country," Sir Edward admitted. "I
must confess that my thoughts had turned elsewhere."
<P>
"Let me tell you this, sir," Mr. Coulson continued. "I should
imagine that the trouble with Washington, if there is any, is
simply that they will not believe that your police have a free
hand. They will not believe that you are honestly and genuinely
anxious for the discovery of the perpetrator of these crimes. I
speak without authority, you understand? I am no more in a
position to discuss this affair than any other tourist from my
country who might happen to come along."
<P>
Sir Edward shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"Can you suggest any method," he asked a little dryly, "by means
of which we might remove this unfortunate impression?"
<P>
Mr. Coulson flicked the ash once more from the end of his cigar
and looked at it thoughtfully.
<P>
"This isn't my show," he said, "and, you understand, I am giving
the views of Mr. James B. Coulson, and nobody but Mr. James B.
Coulson, but if I were in your position, and knew that a friendly
country was feeling a little bit sore at having two of her
citizens disposed of so unceremoniously, I'd do my best to prove,
by the only possible means, that I was taking the matter
seriously."
<P>
"The only possible means being?" Sir Edward asked.
<P>
"I guess I'd offer a reward," Mr. Coulson admitted.
<P>
Sir Edward did not hesitate for a moment.
<P>
"Your idea is an excellent one, Mr. Coulson," he said. "It has
already been mooted, but we will give it a little emphasis.
Tomorrow we will offer a reward of one thousand pounds for any
information leading to the apprehension of either murderer."
<P>
"That sounds bully," Mr. Coulson declared.
<P>
"You think that it will have a good effect upon your friends in
Washington?"
<P>
"Me?" Mr. Coulson asked. "I know nothing about it. I've given you
my personal opinion only. Seems to me, though, it's the best way
of showing that you're in earnest."
<P>
"Before we quit this subject finally, Mr. Coulson," Sir Edward
said, "I am going to ask you a question which you have been asked
before."
<P>
"Referring to Hamilton Fynes?" Mr. Coulson asked.
<P>
"Yes!"
<P>
"Get your young man to lay his hand on that copy of the Comet,"
Mr. Coulson begged earnestly. "I told that pushing young
journalist all I knew and a bit more. I assure you, my
information isn't worth anything."
<P>
"Was it meant to be worth anything?" Sir Edward asked.
<P>
Mr. Coulson remained imperturbable.
<P>
"If you don't mind, Sir Edward," he said, "I guess we'll drop the
subject of Mr. Hamilton Fynes. We can't get any forwarder. Let it
go at that."
<P>
There was a knock at the door. Sir Edward's secretary ushered in
a tall, plainly dressed gentleman, who had the slightly aggrieved
air of a man who has been kept out of his bed beyond the usual
time.
<P>
"My dear Bransome," he said, shaking hands, "isn't this a little
unreasonable of you? Business at this hour of the night! I was in
the midst of a most amusing conversation with a delightful
acquaintance of your wife's, a young lady who turned up her nose
at Hegel and had developed a philosophy of her own. I was just
beginning to grasp its first principles. Nothing else, I am quite
sure, would have kept me awake."
<P>
Sir Edward leaned across the table towards Mr. Coulson. Mr.
Coulson had risen to his feet.
<P>
"This gentleman," he said, "is Mr. Smith."
<P>
The newcomer opened his lips to protest, but Sir Edward held out
his hand.
<P>
"One moment," he begged. "Our friend here--Mr. J. B. Coulson from
New York--has brought a letter from America. He is sailing
tomorrow,--leaving London somewhere about eight o'clock in the
morning, I imagine. He wishes to take back a verbal reply. The
letter, you will understand, comes from a Mr. Jones, and the
reply is delivered in the presence of--Mr. Smith. Our friend here
is not personally concerned in these affairs. As a matter of
fact, I believe he has been on the Continent exploiting some
patents of his own invention."
<P>
The newcomer accepted the burden of his altered nomenclature and
took up the letter. He glanced at the signature, and his manner
became at once more interested. He accepted the chair which Sir
Edward had placed by his side, and, drawing the electric light a
little nearer, read the document through, word by word. Then he
folded it up, and glanced first at his colleague and afterwards
at Mr. Coulson.
<P>
"I understand," he said, "that this is a private inquiry from a
private gentleman, who is entitled, however, to as much courtesy
as it is possible for us to show him."
<P>
"That is exactly the position, sir," Mr. Coulson replied.
"Negotiations of a more formal character are naturally conducted
between your Foreign Office and the Foreign Office of my country.
These few lines come from man to man. I think that it occurred to
my friend that it might save a great deal of trouble, a great
deal of specious diplomacy, and a great many hundred pages of
labored despatches, if, at the bottom of it all, he knew your
true feelings concerning this question. It is, after all, a
simple matter," Mr. Coulson continued, "and yet it is a matter
with so many ramifications that after much discussion it might
become a veritable chaos."
<P>
Mr. Smith inclined his head gently.
<P>
"I appreciate the situation," he said. "My friend here--Sir
Edward Bransome--and I have already discussed the matter at great
length. We have also had the benefit of the advice and help of a
greater Foreign Minister than either of us could ever hope to
become. I see no objection to giving you the verbal reply you ask
for. Do you, Bransome?"
<P>
"None whatever, sir."
<P>
"I leave it to you to put it in your own words," Mr. Smith
continued. "The affair is within your province, and the policy of
His Majesty's Ministers is absolutely fixed."
<P>
Sir Edward turned toward their visitor.
<P>
"Mr. Coulson," he said, "we are asked by your friend, in a few
plain words, what the attitude of Great Britain would be in the
event of a war between Japan and America. My answer--our
answer--to you is this,--no war between Japan and America is
likely to take place unless your Cabinet should go to
unreasonable and uncalled-for extremes. We have ascertained,
beyond any measure of doubt, the sincere feeling of our ally in
this matter. Japan does not desire war, is not preparing for it,
is unwilling even to entertain the possibility of it. At the same
time she feels that her sons should receive the same
consideration from every nation in the world as the sons of other
people. Personally it is our profound conviction that the good
sense, the fairness, and the generous instincts of your great
country will recognize this and act accordingly. War between your
country and Japan is an impossible thing. The thought of it
exists only in the frothy vaporings of cheap newspapers, and the
sensational utterances of the catch politician who must find an
audience and a hearing by any methods. The sober possibility of
such a conflict does not exist."
<P>
Mr. Coulson listened attentively to every word. When Sir Edward
had finished, he withdrew his cigar from his mouth and knocked
the ash on to a corner of the writing table.
<P>
"That's all very interesting indeed, Sir Edward," he declared. 
"I am very pleased to have heard what you have said, and I shall
repeat it to my friend on the other side, who, I am sure, will be
exceedingly obliged to you for such a frank exposition of your
views. And now," he continued, "I don't want to keep you
gentlemen up too late, so perhaps you will be coming to the
answer of my question."
<P>
"The answer!" Sir Edward exclaimed. "Surely I made myself clear?"
<P>
"All that you have said, " Mr. Coulson admitted, "has been
remarkably clear, but the question I asked you was this,--what is
to be the position of your country in the event of war between
Japan and America?"
<P>
"And I have told you," Sir Edward declared, "that war between
Japan and America is not a subject within the scope of practical
politics."
<P>
"We may consider ourselves--my friend Mr. Jones would certainly
consider himself," Mr. Coulson affirmed,--"as good a judge as
you, Sir Edward, so far as regards that matter. I am not asking
you whether it is probable or improbable. You may know the
feelings of your ally. You do not know ours. We may look into the
future, and we may see that, sooner or later, war between our
country and Japan is a necessity. We may decide that it is better
for us to fight now than later. These things are in the clouds.
They only enter into the present discussion to this extent, but
it is not for you to sit here and say whether war between the
United States and Japan is possible or impossible. What Mr. Jones
asks you is--what would be your position if it should take place?
The little diatribe with which you have just favored me is
exactly the reply we should have expected to receive formally
from Downing Street. It isn't that sort of reply I want to take
back to Mr. Jones."
<P>
Mr. Smith and his colleague exchanged glances, and the latter
drew his chief on one side.
<P>
"You will excuse me for a moment, I know, Mr. Coulson," he said.
<P>
"Why, by all means," Mr. Coulson declared. "My time is my own,
and it is entirely at your service. If you say the word, I'll go
outside and wait."
<P>
"It is not necessary," Sir Edward answered.
<P>
The room was a large one, and the two men walked slowly up and
down, Mr. Smith leaning all the time upon his colleague's
shoulder. They spoke in an undertone, and what they said was
inaudible to Mr. Coulson. During his period of waiting he drew
another cigar from his pocket, and lit it from the stump of the
old one. Then he made himself a little more comfortable in his
chair, and looked around at the walls of the handsomely furnished
but rather sombre apartment with an air of pleased curiosity. It
was scarcely, perhaps, what he should have expected from a man in
a similar position in his own country, but it was, at any rate,
impressive. Presently they came back to him. This time it was Mr.
Smith who spoke.
<P>
"Mr. Coulson," he said, "we need not beat about the bush. You ask
us a plain question and you want a plain answer. Then I must tell
you this. The matter is not one concerning which I can give you
any definite information. I appreciate the position of your
friend Mr. Jones, and I should like to have met him in the same
spirit as he has shown in his inquiry, but I may tell you that,
being utterly convinced that Japan does not seek war with you,
and that therefore no war is likely, my Government is not
prepared to answer a question which they consider based upon an
impossibility. If this war should come, the position of our
country would depend entirely upon the rights of the dispute. As
a corollary to that, I would mention two things. You read your
newspapers, Mr. Coulson?"
<P>
"Sure!" that gentleman answered.
<P>
"You are aware, then," Mr. Smith continued, "of the present
position of your fleet. You know how many months must pass before
it can reach Eastern waters. It is not within the traditions of
this country to evade fulfillment of its obligations, however
severe and unnatural they may seem, but in three months' time,
Mr. Coulson, our treaty with Japan will have expired."
<P>
"You are seeking to renew it!" Mr. Coulson declared quickly.
<P>
Mr. Smith raised his eyebrows.
<P>
"The renewal of that treaty," he said, "is on the knees of the
gods. One cannot tell. I go so far only as to tell you that in
three months the present treaty will have expired."
<P>
Mr. Coulson rose slowly to his feet and took up his hat.
<P>
"Gentlemen both," he said, "that's what I call plain speaking. I
suppose it's up to us to read between the lines. I can assure you
that my friend Mr. Jones will appreciate it. It isn't my place to
say a word outside the letter which I have handed to you. I am a
plain business man, and these things don't come in my way. That
is why I feel I can criticize,--I am unprejudiced. You are
Britishers, and you've got one eternal fault. You seem to think
the whole world must see a matter as you see it. If Japan has
convinced you that she doesn't seek a war with us, it doesn't
follow that she's convinced us. As to the rights of our dispute,
don't rely so much upon hearing one side only. Don't be dogmatic
about it, and say this thing is and that thing isn't. You may bet
your last dollar that America isn't going to war about trifles.
We are the same flesh and blood, you know. We have the same
traditions to uphold. What we do is what we should expect you to
do if you were in our place. That's all, gentlemen. Now I wish
you both good night! Mr. Smith, I am proud to shake hands with
you. Sir Edward, I say the same to you."
<P>
Bransome touched the bell and summoned his secretary.
<P>
"Sidney, will you see this gentleman out?" he said. "You are
quite sure there is nothing further we can do for you, Mr.
Coulson?"
<P>
"Nothing at all, I thank you, sir," that gentleman answered. "I
have only got to thank you once more for the pleasure of this
brief interview. Good night!"
<P>
"Good night, and bon voyage!" Sir Edward answered.
<P>
The door was closed. The two men looked at one another for a
moment. Mr. Smith shrugged his shoulders and helped himself to a
cigarette.
<P>
"I wonder," he remarked thoughtfully, "how our friends in Japan
convinced themselves so thoroughly that Mr. Jones was only
playing ships!"
<P>
Sir Edward shook his head.
<P>
"It makes one wonder," he said.
