It was very manifest in the disorder of papers amidst which White
spent so many evenings of interested perplexity before this novel
began to be written that Benham had never made any systematic
attempt at editing or revising his accumulation at all.  There were
not only overlapping documents, in which he had returned again to
old ideas and restated them in the light of fresh facts and an
apparent unconsciousness of his earlier effort, but there were
mutually destructive papers, new views quite ousting the old had
been tossed in upon the old, and the very definition of the second
limitation, as it had first presented itself to the writer, had been
abandoned.  To begin with, this second division had been labelled
"Sex," in places the heading remained, no effective substitute had
been chosen for some time, but there was d many
appetites that are not sexual yet turn to bodily pleasure, and on
the other there are elements of pride arising out of sex and passing
into other regions, all the elements of rivalry for example, that
have strained my first definition to the utmost.  And I conceive it, marches
to its end.  It
saves itself for the truth rather than sacrifices itself
romantically for a friend.  It justifies vivisection if thereby
knowledge is won for ever.  It upholds that Brutus who killed his
sons.  It forbids devotion to women, courts of love and all such
decay of the chivala closely-written
memorandum, very much erased and written over and amended, which
showed Benham's early dissatisfaction with that crude rendering of
what he had in mind.  This memorandum was tacked to an interrupted
fragment of autobiography, a manuscript soliloquy in which Benham
had been discussing his married life.
<P>
"It was not until I had been married for the better part of a year,
and had spent more than six months in London, that I faced the plain
issue between the aims I had set before myself and the claims and
immediate necessities of my personal life.  For all that time I
struggled not so much to reconcile them as to serve them
simultaneously. . . ."
<P>
At that the autobiography stopped short, and the intercalary note
began.
<P>
This intercalary note ran as follows:
<P>
"I suppose a mind of my sort cannot help but tend towards
simplification, towards making all life turn upon some one dominant
idea, complex perhaps in its reality but reducible at last to one
consistent simple statement, a dominant idea which is essential as
nothing else is essential, which makes and sustains and justifies.
This is perhaps the innate disposition of the human mind, at least
of the European mind--for I have some doubts about the Chinese.
Theology drives obstinately towards an ultimate unity in God,
science towards an ultimate unity in law, towards a fundamental
element and a universal material truth from which all material
truths evolve, and in matters of conduct there is the same tendency
to refer to a universal moral law.  Now this may be a simplification
due to the need of the human mind to comprehend, and its inability
to do so until the load is lightened by neglecting factors.  William
James has suggested that on account of this, theology may be
obstinately working away from the truth, that the truth may be that
there are several or many in compatible and incommensurable gods;
science, in the same search for unity, may follow divergent methods
of inquiry into ultimately uninterchangeable generalizations; and
there may be not only not one universal moral law, but no effective
reconciliation of the various rights and duties of a single
individual.  At any rate I find myself doubtful to this day about my
own personal systems of right and wrong.  I can never get all my
life into one focus.  It is exactly like examining a rather thick
section with a microscope of small penetratrion; sometimes one level
is clear and the rest foggy and monstrous, and sometimes another.
<P>
"Now the ruling ME, I do not doubt, is the man who has set his face
to this research after aristocracy, and from the standpoint of this
research it is my duty to subordinate all other considerations to
this work of clearing up the conception of rule and nobility in
human affairs.  This is my aristocratic self.  What I did not grasp
for a long time, and which now grows clearer and clearer to me, is
firstly that this aristocratic self is not the whole of me, it has
absolutely nothing to do with a pain in my ear or in my heart, with
a scar on my hand or my memory, and secondly that it is not
altogether mine.  Whatever knowledge I have of the quality of
science, whatever will I have towards right, is of it; but if from
without, from the reasoning or demonstration or reproof of some one
else, there comes to me clear knowledge, clarified will, that also
is as it were a part of my aristocratic self coming home to me from
the outside.  How often have I not found my own mind in Prothero
after I have failed to find it in myself?  It is, to be paradoxical,
my impersonal personality, this Being that I have in common with all
scientific-spirited and aristocratic-spirited men.  This it is that
I am trying to get clear from the great limitations of humanity.
When I assert a truth for the sake of truth to my own discomfort or
injury, there again is this incompatibility of the aristocratic self
and the accepted, confused, conglomerate self of the unanalyzed man.
The two have a separate system of obligations.  One's affections,
compounded as they are in the strangest way of physical reactions
and emotional associations, one's implicit pledges to particular
people, one's involuntary reactions, one's pride and jealousy, all
that one might call the dramatic side of one's life, may be in
conflict with the definitely seen rightnesses of one's higher
use. . . ."
<P>
The writing changed at this point.
<P>
"All this seems to me at once as old as the hills and too new to be
true.  This is like the conflict of the Superior Man of Confucius to
control himself, it is like the Christian battle of the spirit with
the flesh, it savours of that eternal wrangle between the general
and the particular which is metaphysics, it was for this
aristocratic self, for righteousness' sake, that men have hungered
and thirsted, and on this point men have left father and mother and
child and wife and followed after salvation.  This world-wide, ever-
returning antagonism has filled the world in every age with hermits
and lamas, recluses and teachers, devoted and segregated lives.  It
is a perpetual effort to get above the simplicity of barbarism.
Whenever men have emerged from the primitive barbarism of the farm
and the tribe, then straightway there has emerged this conception of
a specialized life a little lifted off the earth; often, for the
sake of freedom, celibate, usually disciplined, sometimes directed,
having a generalized aim, beyond personal successes and bodily
desires.  So it is that the philosopher, the scientifically
concentrated man, has appeared, often, I admit, quite ridiculously
at first, setting out upon the long journey that will end only when
the philosopher is king. . . .
<P>
"At first I called my Second Limitation, Sex.  But from the outset I
meant more than mere sexual desire, lust and lustful imaginings,
more than personal reactions to beauty and spirited living, more
even than what is called love.  On the one hand I had in minsee now that
this Second Limitation as I first imagined it spreads out without
any definite boundary, to include one's rivalries with old
schoolfellows, for example, one's generosities to beggars and
dependents, one's desire to avenge an injured friend, one's point of
honour, one's regard for the good opinion of an aunt and one's
concern for the health of a pet cat.  All these things may enrich,
but they may also impede and limit the aristocratic scheme.  I
thought for a time I would call this ill-defined and miscellaneous
wilderness of limitation the Personal Life.  But at last I have
decided to divide this vast territory of difficulties into two
subdivisions and make one of these Indulgence, meaning thereby
pleasurable indulgence of sense or feeling, and the other a great
mass of self-regarding motives that will go with a little stretching
under the heading of Jealousy.  I admit motives are continually
playing across the boundary of these two divisions, I should find it
difficult to argue a case for my classification, but in practice
these two groupings have a quite definite meaning for me.  There is
pride in the latter group of impulses and not in the former; the
former are always a little apologetic.  Fear, Indulgence, Jealousy,
these are the First Three Limitations of the soul of man.  And the
greatest of these is Jealousy, because it can use pride.  Over them
the Life Aristocratic, as I ous idea.  And it resigns--so many things that
no common Man of Spirit will resign.  Its intention transcends these
things.  Over all the world it would maintain justice, order, a
noble peace, and it would do this without indignation, without
resentment, without mawkish tenderness or individualized enthusiasm
or any queen of beauty.  It is of a cold austere quality, commanding
sometimes admiration but having small hold upon the affections of
men.  So that it is among its foremost distinctions that its heart
is steeled. . . ."
<P>
There this odd fragment ended and White was left to resume the
interrupted autobiography.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
What moods, what passions, what nights of despair and gathering
storms of anger, what sudden cruelties and amazing tendernesses are
buried and hidden and implied in every love story!  What a waste is
there of exquisite things!  So each spring sees a million glorious
beginnings, a sunlit heaven in every opening leaf, warm perfection
in every stirring egg, hope and fear and beauty beyond computation
in every forest tree; and in the autumn before the snows come they
have all gone, of all that incalculable abundance of life, of all
that hope and adventure, excitement and deliciousness, there is
scarcely more to be found than a soiled twig, a dirty seed, a dead
leaf, black mould or a rotting feather. . . .
<P>
White held the ten or twelve pencilled pages that told how Benham
and Amanda drifted into antagonism and estrangement and as he held
it he thought of the laughter and delight they must have had
together, the exquisite excitements of her eye, the racing colour of
her cheek, the gleams of light upon her skin, the flashes of wit
between them, the sense of discovery, the high rare paths they had
followed, the pools in which they had swum together.  And now it was
all gone into nothingness, there was nothing left of it, nothing at
all, but just those sheets of statement, and it may be, stored away
in one single mind, like things forgotten in an attic, a few
neglected faded memories. . . .
<P>
And even those few sheets of statement were more than most love
leaves behind it.  For a time White would not read them.  They lay
neglected on his knee as he sat back in Benham's most comfortable
chair and enjoyed an entirely beautiful melancholy.
<P>
White too had seen and mourned the spring.
<P>
Indeed, poor dear! he had seen and mourned several springs. . . .
<P>
With a sigh he took up the manuscript and read Benham's desiccated
story of intellectual estrangement, and how in the end he had
decided to leave his wife and go out alone upon that journey of
inquiry he had been planning when first he met her.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Amanda had come back to England in a state of extravagantly vigorous
womanhood.  Benham's illness, though it lasted only two or three
weeks, gave her a sense of power and leadership for which she had
been struggling instinctively ever since they came together.  For a
time at Locarno he was lax-minded and indolent, and in that time she
formed her bright and limited plans for London.  Benham had no plans
as yet but only a sense of divergence, as though he was being pulled
in opposite directions by two irresistible forces.  To her it was
plain that he needed occupation, some distinguished occupation, and
she could imagine nothing better for him than a political career.
She perceived he had personality, that he stood out among men so
that his very silences were effective.  She loved him immensely, and
she had tremendous ambitions for him and through him.
<P>
And also London, the very thought of London, filled her with
appetite.  Her soul thirsted for London.  It was like some enormous
juicy fruit waiting for her pretty white teeth, a place almost large
enough to give her avidity the sense of enough.  She felt it waiting
for her, household, servants, a carriage, shops and the jolly
delight of buying and possessing things, the opera, first-nights,
picture exhibitions, great dinner-parties, brilliant lunch parties,
crowds seen from a point of vantage, the carriage in a long string
of fine carriages with the lamplit multitude peering, Amanda in a
thousand bright settings, in a thousand various dresses.  She had
had love; it had been glorious, it was still glorious, but her love-
making became now at times almost perfunctory in the contemplation
of these approaching delights and splendours and excitements.
<P>
She knew, indeed, that ideas were at work in Benham's head; but she
was a realist.  She did not see why ideas should stand in the way of
a career.  Ideas are a brightness, the good looks of the mind.  One
talks ideas, but THE THING THAT IS, IS THE THING THAT IS.  And
though she believed that Benham had a certain strength of character
of his own, she had that sort of confidence in his love for her and
in the power of her endearments that has in it the assurance of a
faint contempt.  She had mingled pride and sense in the glorious
realization of the power over him that her wit and beauty gave her.
She had held him faint with her divinity, intoxicated with the pride
of her complete possession, and she did not dream that the moment
when he should see clearly that she could deliberately use these
ultimate delights to rule and influence him, would be the end of
their splendour and her power.  Her nature, which was just a nest of
vigorous appetites, was incapable of suspecting his gathering
disillusionment until it burst upon her.
<P>
Now with her attention set upon London ahead he could observe her.
In the beginning he had never seemed to be observing her at all,
they dazzled one another; it seemed extraordinary now to him to note
how much he had been able to disregard.  There were countless times
still when he would have dropped his observation and resumed that
mutual exaltation very gladly, but always now other things possessed
her mind. . . .
<P>
There was still an immense pleasure for him in her vigour; there was
something delightful in her pounce, even when she was pouncing on
things superficial, vulgar or destructive.  She made him understand
and share the excitement of a big night at the opera, the glitter
and prettiness of a smart restaurant, the clustering little acute
adventures of a great reception of gay people, just as she had
already made him understand and sympathize with dogs.  She picked up
the art world where he had laid it down, and she forced him to feel
dense and slow before he rebelled against her multitudinous
enthusiasms and admirations.  South Harting had had its little group
of artistic people; it is not one of your sleepy villages, and she
slipped back at once into the movement.  Those were the great days
of John, the days before the Post Impressionist outbreak.  John,
Orpen, Tonks, she bought them with vigour.  Artistic circles began
to revolve about her.  Very rapidly she was in possession. . . .
And among other desirable things she had, it seemed, pounced upon
and captured Lady Marayne.
<P>
At any rate it was clear that that awful hostile silence and
aloofness was to end.  Benham never quite mastered how it was done.
But Amanda had gone in one morning to Desborough Street, very
sweetly and chastely dressed, had abased herself and announced a
possible (though subsequently disproved) grandchild.  And she had
appreciated the little lady so highly and openly, she had so
instantly caught and reproduced her tone, that her success, though
only temporary in its completeness, was immediate.  In the afternoon
Benham was amazed by the apparition of his mother amidst the
scattered unsettled furnishings of the new home Amanda had chosen in
Lancaster Gate.  He was in the hall, the door stood open awaiting
packing-cases from a van without.  In the open doorway she shone,
looking the smallest of dainty things.  There was no effect of her
coming but only of her having arrived there, as a little blue
butterfly will suddenly alight on a flower.
<P>
"Well, Poff!" said Lady Marayne, ignoring abysses, "What are you up
to now, Poff?  Come and embrace me. . . ."
<P>
"No, not so," she said, "stiffest of sons. . . ."
<P>
She laid hold of his ears in the old fashion and kissed one eye.
<P>
"Congratulations, dear little Poff.  Oh! congratulations!  In heaps.
I'm so GLAD."
<P>
Now what was that for?
<P>
And then Amanda came out upon the landing upstairs, saw the
encounter with an involuntary cry of joy, and came downstairs with
arms wide open.  It was the first intimation he had of their
previous meeting.  He was for some minutes a stunned, entirely
inadequate Benham. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
At first Amanda knew nobody in London, except a few people in the
Hampstead Garden suburb that she had not the slightest wish to know,
and then very quickly she seemed to know quite a lot of people.  The
artistic circle brought in people, Lady Marayne brought in people;
they spread.  It was manifest the Benhams were a very bright young
couple; he would certainly do something considerable presently, and
she was bright and daring, jolly to look at and excellent fun, and,
when you came to talk to her, astonishingly well informed.  They
passed from one hostess's hand to another: they reciprocated.  The
Clynes people and the Rushtones took her up; Mr. Evesham was amused
by her, Lady Beach Mandarin proclaimed her charm like a trumpet, the
Young Liberal people made jealous advances, Lord Moggeridge found
she listened well, she lit one of the brightest weekend parties Lady
Marayne had ever gathered at Chexington.  And her descriptions of
recent danger and adventure in Albania not only entertained her
hearers but gave her just that flavour of personal courage which
completes the fascination of a young woman.  People in the gaps of a
halting dinner-table conversation would ask: "Have you met Mrs.
Benham?"
<P>
Meanwhile Benham appeared to be talking.  A smiling and successful
young woman, who a year ago had been nothing more than a leggy girl
with a good lot of miscellaneous reading in her head, and vaguely
engaged, or at least friendly to the pitch of engagement, to Mr.
Rathbone-Sanders, may be forgiven if in the full tide of her success
she does not altogether grasp the intention of her husband's
discourse.  It seemed to her that he was obsessed by a
responsibility for civilization and the idea that he was
aristocratic.  (Secretly she was inclined to doubt whether he was
justified in calling himself aristocratic; at the best his mother
was county-stuff; but still if he did there was no great harm in it
nowadays.)  Clearly his line was Tory-Democracy, social reform
through the House of Lords and friendly intimacy with the more
spirited young peers.  And it was only very slowly and reluctantly
that she was forced to abandon this satisfactory solution of his
problem.  She reproduced all the equipment and comforts of his
Finacue Street study in their new home, she declared constantly that
she would rather forego any old social thing than interfere with his
work, she never made him go anywhere with her without first asking
if his work permitted it.  To relieve him of the burthen of such
social attentions she even made a fag or so.  The making of fags out
of manifestly stricken men, the keeping of tamed and hopeless
admirers, seemed to her to be the most natural and reasonable of
feminine privileges.  They did their useful little services until it
pleased the Lord Cheetah to come to his own.  That was how she put
it. . . .
<P>
But at last he was talking to her in tones that could no longer be
ignored.  He was manifestly losing his temper with her.  There was a
novel austerity in his voice and a peculiar whiteness about his face
on certain occasions that lingered in her memory.
<P>
He was indeed making elaborate explanations.  He said that what he
wanted to do was to understand "the collective life of the world,"
and that this was not to be done in a West-End study.  He had an
extraordinary contempt, it seemed, for both sides in the drama of
British politics.  He had extravagant ideas of beginning in some
much more fundamental way.  He wanted to understand this "collective
life of the world," because ultimately he wanted to help control it.
(Was there ever such nonsense?)  The practical side of this was
serious enough, however; he was back at his old idea of going round
the earth.  Later on that might be rather a jolly thing to do, but
not until they had struck root a little more surely in London.
<P>
And then with amazement, with incredulity, with indignation, she
began to realize that he was proposing to go off by himself upon
this vague extravagant research, that all this work she had been
doing to make a social place for him in London was as nothing to
him, that he was thinking of himself as separable from her. . . .
<P>
"But, Cheetah!  How can you leave your spotless leopard?  You would
howl in the lonely jungle!"
<P>
"Possibly I shall.  But I am going."
<P>
"Then I shall come."
<P>
"No." He considered her reasons.  "You see you are not interested."
<P>
"But I am."
<P>
"Not as I am.  You would turn it all into a jolly holiday.  You
don't want to see things as I want to do.  You want romance.  All
the world is a show for you.  As a show I can't endure it.  I want
to lay hands on it."
<P>
"But, Cheetah!" she said, "this is separation."
<P>
"You will have your life here.  And I shall come back."
<P>
"But, Cheetah!  How can we be separated?"
<P>
"We are separated," he said.
<P>
Her eyes became round with astonishment.  Then her face puckered.
<P>
"Cheetah!" she cried in a voice of soft distress, "I love you.  What
do you mean?"
<P>
And she staggered forward, tear-blinded, and felt for his neck and
shoulders, so that she might weep in his arms. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
5
<P>
<P>
"Don't say we are separated," she whispered, putting her still wet
face close to his.
<P>
"No.  We're mates," he answered softly, with his arm about her.
<P>
"How could we ever keep away from each uvver?" she whispered.
<P>
He was silent.
<P>
"How COULD we?"
<P>
He answered aloud.  "Amanda," he said, "I mean to go round the
world."
<P>
She disentangled herself from his arm and sat up beside him.
<P>
"What is to become of me," she asked suddenly in a voice of despair,
"while you go round the world?  If you desert me in London," she
said, "if you shame me by deserting me in London--  If you leave me,
I will never forgive you, Cheetah!  Never."  Then in an almost
breathless voice, and as if she spoke to herself, "Never in all my
days."
<P>
<P>
<P>
6
<P>
<P>
It was after that that Amanda began to talk about children.  There
was nothing involuntary about Amanda.  "Soon," she said, "we must
begin to think of children.  Not just now, but a little later.  It's
good to travel and have our fun, but life is unreal until there are
children in the background.  No woman is really content until she is
a mother. . . ."  And for nearly a fortnight nothing more was said
about that solitary journey round the world.
<P>
But children were not the only new topic in Amanda's talk.  She set
herself with an ingenious subtlety to remind her husband that there
were other men in the world.  The convenient fags, sometimes a
little embarrassed, found their inobtrusive services being brought
into the light before Benham's eyes.  Most of them were much older
men than himself, elderly philanderers of whom it seemed to him no
sane man need be jealous, men often of forty or more, but one was a
contemporary, Sir Philip Easton, a man with a touch of Spanish blood
and a suggestion of Spanish fire, who quite manifestly was very much
in love with Amanda and of whom she spoke with a slight perceptible
difference of manner that made Benham faintly uneasy.  He was
ashamed of the feeling.  Easton it seemed was a man of a peculiarly
fine honour, so that Amanda could trust herself with him to an
extent that would have been inadvisable with men of a commoner
substance, and he had a gift of understanding and sympathy that was
almost feminine; he could cheer one up when one was lonely and
despondent.  For Amanda was so methodical in the arrangement of her
time that even in the full rush of a London season she could find an
hour now and then for being lonely and despondent.  And he was a
liberal and understanding purchaser of the ascendant painters; he
understood that side of Amanda's interests, a side upon which Benham
was notably deficient. . . .
<P>
"Amanda seems to like that dark boy, Poff; what is his name?--Sir
Philip Easton?" said Lady Marayne.
<P>
Benham looked at her with a slightly hostile intelligence, and said
nothing.
<P>
"When a man takes a wife, he has to keep her," said Lady Marayne.
<P>
"No," said Benham after consideration.  "I don't intend to be a
wife-herd."
<P>
"What?"
<P>
"Wife-herd--same as goat-herd."
<P>
"Coarse, you are sometimes, Poff--nowadays."
<P>
"It's exactly what I mean.  I can understand the kind of curator's
interest an Oriental finds in shepherding a large establishment, but
to spend my days looking after one person who ought to be able to
look after herself--"
<P>
"She's very young."
<P>
"She's quite grown up.  Anyhow I'm not a moral nursemaid."
<P>
"If you leave her about and go abroad--"
<P>
"Has she been talking to you, mother?"
<P>
"The thing shows."
<P>
"But about my going abroad?"
<P>
"She said something, my little Poff."
<P>
Lady Marayne suddenly perceived that beneath Benham's indifference
was something strung very tight, as though he had been thinking
inordinately.  He weighed his words before he spoke again.  "If
Amanda chooses to threaten me with a sort of conditional infidelity,
I don't see that it ought to change the plans I have made for my
life. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
"No aristocrat has any right to be jealous," Benham wrote.  "If he
chances to be mated with a woman who does not see his vision or
naturally go his way, he has no right to expect her, much less to
compel her to go his way.  What is the use of dragging an unwilling
companion through morasses of uncongenial thought to unsought ends?
What is the use of dragging even a willing pretender, who has no
inherent will to seek and live the aristocratic life?
<P>
"But that does not excuse him from obedience to his own call. . . ."
<P>
He wrote that very early in his examination of the Third Limitation.
Already he had thought out and judged Amanda.  The very charm of
her, the sweetness, the nearness and magic of her, was making him
more grimly resolute to break away.  All the elaborate process of
thinking her over had gone on behind the mask of his silences while
she had been preoccupied with her housing and establishment in
London; it was with a sense of extraordinary injustice, of having
had a march stolen upon her, of being unfairly trapped, that Amanda
found herself faced by foregone conclusions.  He was ready now even
with the details of his project.  She should go on with her life in
London exactly as she had planned it.  He would take fifteen hundred
a year for himself and all the rest she might spend without check or
stint as it pleased her.  He was going round the world for one or
two years.  It was even possible he would not go alone.  There was a
man at Cambridge he might persuade to come with him, a don called
Prothero who was peculiarly useful in helping him to hammer out his
ideas. . . .
<P>
To her it became commandingly necessary that none of these things
should happen.
<P>
She tried to play upon his jealousy, but her quick instinct speedily
told her that this only hardened his heart.  She perceived that she
must make a softer appeal.  Now of a set intention she began to
revive and imitate the spontaneous passion of the honeymoon; she
perceived for the first time clearly how wise and righteous a thing
it is for a woman to bear a child.  "He cannot go if I am going to
have a child," she told herself.  But that would mean illness, and
for illness in herself or others Amanda had the intense disgust
natural to her youth.  Yet even illness would be better than this
intolerable publication of her husband's ability to leave her
side. . . .
<P>
She had a wonderful facility of enthusiasm and she set herself
forthwith to cultivate a philoprogenitive ambition, to communicate
it to him.  Her dread of illness disappeared; her desire for
offspring grew.
<P>
"Yes," he said, "I want to have children, but I must go round the
world none the less."
<P>
She argued with all the concentrated subtlety of her fine keen mind.
She argued with persistence and repetition.  And then suddenly so
that she was astonished at herself, there came a moment when she
ceased to argue.
<P>
She stood in the dusk in a window that looked out upon the park, and
she was now so intent upon her purpose as to be still and self-
forgetful; she was dressed in a dinner-dress of white and pale
green, that set off her slim erect body and the strong clear lines
of her neck and shoulders very beautifully, some greenish stones
caught a light from without and flashed soft whispering gleams from
amidst the misty darkness of her hair.  She was going to Lady
Marayne and the opera, and he was bound for a dinner at the House
with some young Liberals at which he was to meet two representative
Indians with a grievance from Bengal.  Husband and wife had but a
few moments together.  She asked about his company and he told her.
<P>
"They will tell you about India."
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
She stood for a moment looking out across the lights and the dark
green trees, and then she turned to him.
<P>
"Why cannot I come with you?" she asked with sudden passion.  "Why
cannot I see the things you want to see?"
<P>
"I tell you you are not interested.  You would only be interested
through me.  That would not help me.  I should just be dealing out
my premature ideas to you.  If you cared as I care, if you wanted to
know as I want to know, it would be different.  But you don't.  It
isn't your fault that you don't.  It happens so.  And there is no
good in forced interest, in prescribed discovery."
<P>
"Cheetah," she asked, "what is it that you want to know--that I
don't care for?"
<P>
"I want to know about the world.  I want to rule the world."
<P>
"So do I."
<P>
"No, you want to have the world."
<P>
"Isn't it the same?"
<P>
"No.  You're a greedier thing than I am, you Black Leopard you--
standing there in the dusk.  You're a stronger thing.  Don't you
know you're stronger?  When I am with you, you carry your point,
because you are more concentrated, more definite, less scrupulous.
When you run beside me you push me out of my path. . . .  You've
made me afraid of you. . . .  And so I won't go with you, Leopard.
I go alone.  It isn't because I don't love you.  I love you too
well.  It isn't because you aren't beautiful and wonderful. . . ."
<P>
"But, Cheetah! nevertheless you care more for this that you want
than you care for me."
<P>
Benham thought of it.  "I suppose I do," he said.
<P>
"What is it that you want?  Still I don't understand."
<P>
Her voice had the break of one who would keep reasonable in spite of
pain.
<P>
"I ought to tell you."
<P>
"Yes, you ought to tell me."
<P>
"I wonder if I can tell you," he said very thoughtfully, and rested
his hands on his hips.  "I shall seem ridiculous to you."
<P>
"You ought to tell me."
<P>
"I think what I want is to be king of the world."
<P>
She stood quite still staring at him.
<P>
"I do not know how I can tell you of it.  Amanda, do you remember
those bodies--you saw those bodies--those mutilated men?"
<P>
"I saw them," said Amanda.
<P>
"Well.  Is it nothing to you that those things happen?"
<P>
"They must happen."
<P>
"No.  They happen because there are no kings but pitiful kings.
They happen because the kings love their Amandas and do not care."
<P>
"But what can YOU do, Cheetah?"
<P>
"Very little.  But I can give my life and all my strength.  I can
give all I can give."
<P>
"But how?  How can you help it--help things like that massacre?"
<P>
"I can do my utmost to find out what is wrong with my world and rule
it and set it right."
<P>
"YOU!  Alone."
<P>
"Other men do as much.  Every one who does so helps others to do so.
You see-- . . .  In this world one may wake in the night and one may
resolve to be a king, and directly one has resolved one is a king.
Does that sound foolishness to you?  Anyhow, it's fair that I should
tell you, though you count me a fool.  This--this kingship--this
dream of the night--is my life.  It is the very core of me.  Much
more than you are.  More than anything else can be.  I mean to be a
king in this earth.  KING.  I'm not mad. . . .  I see the world
staggering from misery to misery and there is little wisdom, less
rule, folly, prejudice, limitation, the good things come by chance
and the evil things recover and slay them, and it is my world and I
am responsible.  Every man to whom this light has come is
responsible.  As soon as this light comes to you, as soon as your
kingship is plain to you, there is no more rest, no peace, no
delight, except in work, in service, in utmost effort.  As far as I
can do it I will rule my world.  I cannot abide in this smug city, I
cannot endure its self-complacency, its routine, its gloss of
success, its rottenness. . . .  I shall do little, perhaps I shall
do nothing, but what I can understand and what I can do I will do.
Think of that wild beautiful country we saw, and the mean misery,
the filth and the warring cruelty of the life that lives there,
tragedy, tragedy without dignity; and think, too, of the limitless
ugliness here, and of Russia slipping from disorder to massacre, and
China, that sea of human beings, sliding steadily to disaster.  Do
you think these are only things in the newspapers?  To me at any
rate they are not things in newspapers; they are pain and failure,
they are torment, they are blood and dust and misery.  They haunt me
day and night.  Even if it is utterly absurd I will still do my
utmost.  It IS absurd.  I'm a madman and you and my mother are
sensible people. . . .  And I will go my way. . . .  I don't care
for the absurdity.  I don't care a rap."
<P>
He stopped abruptly.
<P>
"There you have it, Amanda.  It's rant, perhaps.  Sometimes I feel
it's rant.  And yet it's the breath of life to me. . . .  There you
are. . . .  At last I've been able to break silence and tell
you. . . ."
<P>
He stopped with something like a sob and stood regarding the dusky
mystery of her face.  She stood quite still, she was just a
beautiful outline in the twilight, her face was an indistinctness
under the black shadow of her hair, with eyes that were two patches
of darkness.
<P>
He looked at his watch, lifting it close to his face to see the
time.  His voice changed.  "Well--if you provoke a man enough, you
see he makes speeches.  Let it be a lesson to you, Amanda.  Here we
are talking instead of going to our dinners.  The car has been
waiting ten minutes."
<P>
Amanda, so still, was the most disconcerting of all Amandas. . . .
<P>
A strange exaltation seized upon her very suddenly.  In an instant
she had ceased to plot against him.  A vast wave of emotion swept
her forward to a resolution that astonished her.
<P>
"Cheetah!" she said, and the very quality of her voice had changed,
"give me one thing.  Stay until June with me."
<P>
"Why?" he asked.
<P>
Her answer came in a voice so low that it was almost a whisper.
<P>
"Because--now--no, I don't want to keep you any more--I am not
trying to hold you any more. . . .  I want. . . ."
<P>
She came forward to him and looked up closely at his face.
<P>
"Cheetah," she whispered almost inaudibly, "Cheetah--I didn't
understand.  But now--.  I want to bear your child."
<P>
He was astonished.  "Old Leopard!" he said.
<P>
"No," she answered, putting her hands upon his shoulders and drawing
very close to him, "Queen---if I can be--to your King."
<P>
"You want to bear me a child!" he whispered, profoundly moved.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
The Hindu agitators at the cavernous dinner under the House of
Commons came to the conclusion that Benham was a dreamer.  And over
against Amanda at her dinner-party sat Sir Sidney Umber, one of
those men who know that their judgments are quoted.
<P>
"Who is the beautiful young woman who is seeing visions?" he asked
of his neighbour in confidential undertones. . . .
<P>
He tittered.  "I think, you know, she ought to seem just SLIGHTLY
aware that the man to her left is talking to her. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
A few days later Benham went down to Cambridge, where Prothero was
now a fellow of Trinity and Brissenden Trust Lecturer. . . .
<P>
All through Benham's writing there was manifest a persuasion that in
some way Prothero was necessary to his mind.  It was as if he looked
to Prothero to keep him real.  He suspected even while he obeyed
that upward flourish which was his own essential characteristic.  He
had a peculiar feeling that somehow that upward bias would betray
him; that from exaltation he might presently float off, into the
higher, the better, and so to complete unreality.  He fled from
priggishness and the terror of such sublimity alike to Prothero.
Moreover, in relation to so many things Prothero in a peculiar
distinctive manner SAW.  He had less self-control than Benham, less
integrity of purpose, less concentration, and things that were
before his eyes were by the very virtue of these defects invariably
visible to him.  Things were able to insist upon themselves with
him.  Benham, on the other hand, when facts contradicted his purpose
too stoutly, had a way of becoming blind to them.  He repudiated
inconvenient facts.  He mastered and made his world; Prothero
accepted and recorded his.  Benham was a will towards the universe
where Prothero was a perception and Amanda a confusing responsive
activity.  And it was because of his realization of this profound
difference between them that he was possessed by the idea of taking
Prothero with him about the world, as a detachable kind of vision--
rather like that eye the Graiae used to hand one another. . . .
<P>
After the busy sunlit streets of Maytime Cambridge, Prothero's rooms
in Trinity, their windows full of Gothic perspectives and light-
soaked blue sky, seemed cool and quiet.  A flavour of scholarship
pervaded them--a little blended with the flavour of innumerable
breakfasts nearly but not completely forgotten.  Prothero's door had
been locked against the world, and he had appeared after a slight
delay looking a little puffy and only apprehending who his visitor
was after a resentful stare for the better part of a second.  He
might have been asleep, he might have been doing anything but the
examination papers he appeared to be doing.  The two men exchanged
personal details; they had not met since some months before Benham'
s marriage, and the visitor's eye went meanwhile from his host to
the room and back to his host's face as though they were all aspects
of the thing he was after, the Prothero humour, the earthly touch,
the distinctive Prothero flavour.  Then his eye was caught by a
large red, incongruous, meretricious-looking volume upon the couch
that had an air of having been flung aside, VENUS IN GEM AND MARBLE,
its cover proclaimed. . . .
<P>
His host followed that glance and blushed.  "They send me all sorts
of inappropriate stuff to review," he remarked.
<P>
And then he was denouncing celibacy.
<P>
The transition wasn't very clear to Benham.  His mind had been
preoccupied by the problem of how to open his own large project.
Meanwhile Prothero got, as it were, the conversational bit between
his teeth and bolted.  He began to say the most shocking things
right away, so that Benham's attention was caught in spite of
himself.
<P>
"Inflammatory classics."
<P>
"What's that?"
<P>
"Celibacy, my dear Benham, is maddening me," said Prothero.  "I
can't stand it any longer."
<P>
It seemed to Benham that somewhere, very far away, in another world,
such a statement might have been credible.  Even in his own life,--
it was now indeed a remote, forgotten stage--there had been
something distantly akin. . . .
<P>
"You're going to marry?"
<P>
"I must."
<P>
"Who's the lady, Billy?"
<P>
"I don't know.  Venus."
<P>
His little red-brown eye met his friend's defiantly.  "So far as I
know, it is Venus Anadyomene."  A flash of laughter passed across
his face and left it still angrier, still more indecorously defiant.
"I like her best, anyhow.  I do, indeed.  But, Lord!  I feel that
almost any of them--"
<P>
"Tut, tut!" said Benham.
<P>
Prothero flushed deeply but stuck to his discourse.
<P>
"Wasn't it always your principle, Benham, to look facts in the face?
I am not pronouncing an immoral principle.  Your manner suggests I
am.  I am telling you exactly how I feel.  That is how I feel.  I
want--Venus.  I don't want her to talk to or anything of that
sort. . . .  I have been studying that book, yes, that large,
vulgar, red book, all the morning, instead of doing any work.
Would you like to see it? . . .  NO! . . .
<P>
"This spring, Benham, I tell you, is driving me mad.  It is a
peculiarly erotic spring.  I cannot sleep, I cannot fix my mind, I
cannot attend to ordinary conversation.  These feelings, I
understand, are by no means peculiar to myself. . . .  No, don't
interrupt me, Benham; let me talk now that the spirit of speech is
upon me.  When you came in you said, ‘How are you?'  I am telling
you how I am.  You brought it on yourself.  Well--I am--inflamed.  I
have no strong moral or religious convictions to assist me either to
endure or deny this--this urgency.  And so why should I deny it?
It's one of our chief problems here.  The majority of my fellow dons
who look at me with secretive faces in hall and court and
combination-room are in just the same case as myself.  The fever in
oneself detects the fever in others.  I know their hidden thoughts.
Their fishy eyes defy me to challenge their hidden thoughts.  Each
covers his miserable secret under the cloak of a wholesome manly
indifference.  A tattered cloak. . . .  Each tries to hide his
abandonment to this horrible vice of continence--"
<P>
"Billy, what's the matter with you?"
<P>
Prothero grimaced impatience.  "Shall I NEVER teach you not to be a
humbug, Benham?" he screamed, and in screaming became calmer.
"Nature taunts me, maddens me.  My life is becoming a hell of shame.
‘Get out from all these books,' says Nature, ‘and serve the Flesh.'
The Flesh, Benham.  Yes--I insist--the Flesh.  Do I look like a pure
spirit?  Is any man a pure spirit?  And here am I at Cambridge like
a lark in a cage, with too much port and no Aspasia.  Not that I
should have liked Aspasia."
<P>
"Mutual, perhaps, Billy."
<P>
"Oh! you can sneer!"
<P>
"Well, clearly--Saint Paul is my authority--it's marriage, Billy."
<P>
Prothero had walked to the window.  He turned round.
<P>
"I CAN'T marry," he said.  "The trouble has gone too far.  I've lost
my nerve in the presence of women.  I don't like them any more.
They come at one--done up in a lot of ridiculous clothes, and
chattering about all sorts of things that don't matter. . . .  He
surveyed his friend's thoughtful attitude.  "I'm getting to hate
women, Benham.  I'm beginning now to understand the bitterness of
spinsters against men.  I'm beginning to grasp the unkindliness of
priests.  The perpetual denial.  To you, happily married, a woman is
just a human being.  You can talk to her, like her, you can even
admire her calmly; you've got, you see, no grudge against her. . . ."
<P>
He sat down abruptly.
<P>
Benham, upon the hearthrug before the empty fireplace, considered
him.
<P>
"Billy! this is delusion," he said.  "What's come over you?"
<P>
"I'm telling you," said Prothero.
<P>
"No," said Benham.
<P>
Prothero awaited some further utterance.
<P>
"I'm looking for the cause of it.  It's feeding, Billy.  It's port
and stimulants where there is no scope for action.  It's idleness.
I begin to see now how much fatter you are, how much coarser."
<P>
"Idleness!  Look at this pile of examination answers.  Look at that
filing system like an arsenal of wisdom.  Useless wisdom, I admit,
but anyhow not idleness."
<P>
"There's still bodily idleness.  No.  That's your trouble.  You're
stuffy.  You've enlarged your liver.  You sit in this room of a warm
morning after an extravagant breakfast--.  And peep and covet."
<P>
"Just eggs and bacon!"
<P>
"Think of it!  Coffee and toast it ought to be.  Come out of it,
Billy, and get aired."
<P>
"How can one?"
<P>
"Easily.  Come out of it now.  Come for a walk, you Pig!"
<P>
"It's an infernally warm morning.
<P>
"Walk with me to Grantchester."
<P>
"We might go by boat.  You could row."
<P>
"WALK."
<P>
"I ought to do these papers."
<P>
"You weren't doing them."
<P>
"No. . . ."
<P>
"Walk with me to Grantchester.  All this affliction of yours is--
horrid--and just nothing at all.  Come out of it!  I want you to
come with me to Russia and about the world.  I'm going to leave my
wife--"
<P>
"Leave your wife!"
<P>
"Why not?  And I came here hoping to find you clear-headed, and
instead you are in this disgusting state.  I've never met anything
in my life so hot and red and shiny and shameless.  Come out of it,
man!  How can one talk to you?"
<P>
<P>
<P>
10
<P>
<P>
"You pull things down to your own level," said Benham as they went
through the heat to Grantchester.
<P>
"I pull them down to truth," panted Prothero.
<P>
"Truth!  As though being full of gross appetites was truth, and
discipline and training some sort of falsity!"
<P>
"Artificiality.  And begetting pride, Benham, begetting a prig's
pride."
<P>
For a time there was more than the heat of the day between them. . . .
<P>
The things that Benham had come down to discuss were thrust into the
background by the impassioned materialism of Prothero.
<P>
"I'm not talking of Love," he said, remaining persistently
outrageous.  "I'm talking of physical needs.  That first.  What is
the good of arranging systems of morality and sentiment before you
know what is physically possible. . . .
<P>
"But how can one disentangle physical and moral necessities?"
<P>
"Then why don't we up and find out?" said Billy.
<P>
He had no patience with the secrecy, the ignorance, the emotion that
surrounded these questions.  We didn't worship our ancestors when it
came to building bridges or working metals or curing disease or
studying our indigestion, and why should we become breathless or
wordless with awe and terror when it came to this fundamental
affair?  Why here in particular should we give way to Holy Fear and
stifled submission to traditional suppressions and the wisdom of the
ages?  "What is the wisdom of the ages?" said Prothero.  "Think of
the corners where that wisdom was born. . . .  Flea-bitten sages in
stone-age hovels. . . .  Wandering wise man with a rolling eye, a
fakir under a tree, a Jewish sheik, an Arab epileptic. . . ."
<P>
"Would you sweep away the experience of mankind?" protested Benham.
<P>
The experience of mankind in these matters had always been bitter
experience.  Most of it was better forgotten.  It didn't convince.
It had never worked things out.  In this matter just as in every
other matter that really signified things had still to be worked
out.  Nothing had been worked out hitherto.  The wisdom of the ages
was a Cant.  People had been too busy quarrelling, fighting and
running away.  There wasn't any digested experience of the ages at
all.  Only the mis-remembered hankey-pankey of the Dead Old Man.
<P>
"Is this love-making a physical necessity for most men and women or
isn't it?" Prothero demanded.  "There's a simple question enough,
and is there anything whatever in your confounded wisdom of the ages
to tell me yes or no?  Can an ordinary celibate be as healthy and
vigorous as a mated man?  Is a spinster of thirty-eight a healthy
human being?  Can she be?  I don't believe so.  Then why in thunder
do we let her be?  Here am I at a centre of learning and wisdom and
I don't believe so; and there is nothing in all our colleges,
libraries and roomsfull of wiseacres here, to settle that plain
question for me, plainly and finally.  My life is a grubby torment
of cravings because it isn't settled.  If sexual activity IS a part
of the balance of life, if it IS a necessity, well let's set about
making it accessible and harmless and have done with it.  Swedish
exercises.  That sort of thing.  If it isn't, if it can be reduced
and done without, then let us set about teaching people HOW to
control themselves and reduce and get rid of this vehement passion.
But all this muffled mystery, this pompous sneak's way we take with
it!"
<P>
"But, Billy!  How can one settle these things?  It's a matter of
idiosyncrasy.  What is true for one man isn't true for another.
There's infinite difference of temperaments!"
<P>
"Then why haven't we a classification of temperaments and a moral
code for each sort?  Why am I ruled by the way of life that is
convenient for Rigdon the vegetarian and fits Bowler the saint like
a glove?  It isn't convenient for me.  It fits me like a hair-shirt.
Of course there are temperaments, but why can't we formulate them
and exercise the elementary charity of recognizing that one man's
health in these matters is another man's death?  Some want love and
gratification and some don't.  There are people who want children
and people who don't want to be bothered by children but who are
full of vivid desires.  There are people whose only happiness is
chastity, and women who would rather be courtesans than mothers.
Some of us would concentrate upon a single passion or a single idea;
others overflow with a miscellaneous--tenderness.  Yes,--and you
smile!  Why spit upon and insult a miscellaneous tenderness, Benham?
Why grin at it?  Why try every one by the standards that suit
oneself?  We're savages, Benham, shamefaced savages, still.
Shamefaced and persecuting.
<P>
"I was angry about sex by seventeen," he went on.  "Every year I
live I grow angrier."
<P>
His voice rose to a squeal of indignation as he talked.
<P>
"Think," he said, "of the amount of thinking and feeling about sex
that is going on in Cambridge this morning.  The hundreds out of
these thousands full of it.  A vast tank of cerebration.  And we put
none of it together; we work nothing out from that but poor little
couplings and casual stories, patchings up of situations,
misbehaviours, blunders, disease, trouble, escapes; and the next
generation will start, and the next generation after that will start
with nothing but your wisdom of the ages, which isn't wisdom at all,
which is just awe and funk, taboos and mystery and the secretive
cunning of the savage. . . .
<P>
"What I really want to do is my work," said Prothero, going off
quite unexpectedly again.  "That is why all this business, this
incessant craving and the shame of it and all makes me so infernally
angry. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
11
<P>
<P>
"There I'm with you," cried Benham, struggling out of the thick
torrent of Prothero's prepossessions.  "What we want to do is our
work."
<P>
He clung to his idea.  He raised his voice to prevent Prothero
getting the word again.
<P>
"It's this, that you call Work, that I call--what do I call it?--
living the aristocratic life, which takes all the coarse simplicity
out of this business.  If it was only submission. . . .  YOU think
it is only submission--giving way. . . .  It isn't only submission.
We'd manage sex all right, we'd be the happy swine our senses would
make us, if we didn't know all the time that there was something
else to live for, something far more important.  And different.
Absolutely different and contradictory.  So different that it cuts
right across all these considerations.  It won't fit in. . . .  I
don't know what this other thing is; it's what I want to talk about
with you.  But I know that it IS, in all my bones. . . .  YOU
know. . . .  It demands control, it demands continence, it insists
upon disregard."
<P>
But the ideas of continence and disregard were unpleasant ideas to
Prothero that day.
<P>
"Mankind," said Benham, "is overcharged with this sex.  It
suffocates us.  It gives life only to consume it.  We struggle out
of the urgent necessities of a mere animal existence.  We are not so
much living as being married and given in marriage.  All life is
swamped in the love story. . . ."
<P>
"Man is only overcharged because he is unsatisfied," said Prothero,
sticking stoutly to his own view.
<P>
<P>
<P>
12
<P>
<P>
It was only as they sat at a little table in the orchard at
Grantchester after their lunch that Benham could make head against
Prothero and recover that largeness of outlook which had so easily
touched the imagination of Amanda.  And then he did not so much
dispose of Prothero's troubles as soar over them.  It is the last
triumph of the human understanding to sympathize with desires we do
not share, and to Benham who now believed himself to be loved beyond
the chances of life, who was satisfied and tranquil and austerely
content, it was impossible that Prothero's demands should seem
anything more than the grotesque and squalid squealings of the beast
that has to be overridden and rejected altogether.  It is a freakish
fact of our composition that these most intense feelings in life are
just those that are most rapidly and completely forgotten; hate one
may recall for years, but the magic of love and the flame of desire
serve their purpose in our lives and vanish, leaving no trace, like
the snows of Venice.  Benham was still not a year and a half from
the meretricious delights of Mrs. Skelmersdale, and he looked at
Prothero as a marble angel might look at a swine in its sty. . . .
<P>
What he had now in mind was an expedition to Russia.  When at last
he could sufficiently release Prothero's attention, he unfolded the
project that had been developing steadily in him since his honeymoon
experience.
<P>
He had discovered a new reason for travelling.  The last country we
can see clearly, he had discovered, is our own country.  It is as
hard to see one's own country as it is to see the back of one's
head.  It is too much behind us, too much ourselves.  But Russia is
like England with everything larger, more vivid, cruder; one felt
that directly one walked about St. Petersburg.  St. Petersburg upon
its Neva was like a savage untamed London on a larger Thames; they
were seagull-haunted tidal cities, like no other capitals in Europe.
The shipping and buildings mingled in their effects.  Like London it
looked over the heads of its own people to a limitless polyglot
empire.  And Russia was an aristocratic land, with a middle-class
that had no pride in itself as a class; it had a British toughness
and incompetence, a British disregard of logic and meticulous care.
Russia, like England, was outside Catholic Christendom, it had a
state church and the opposition to that church was not secularism
but dissent.  One could draw a score of such contrasted parallels.
And now it was in a state of intolerable stress, that laid bare the
elemental facts of a great social organization.  It was having its
South African war, its war at the other end of the earth, with a
certain defeat instead of a dubious victory. . . .
<P>
"There is far more freedom for the personal life in Russia than in
England," said Prothero, a little irrelevantly.
<P>
Benham went on with his discourse about Russia. . . .
<P>
"At the college of Troitzka," said Prothero, "which I understand is
a kind of monster Trinity unencumbered by a University, Binns tells
me that although there is a profession of celibacy within the walls,
the arrangements of the town and more particularly of the various
hotels are conceived in a spirit of extreme liberality."
<P>
Benham hardly attended at all to these interruptions.
<P>
He went on to point out the elemental quality of the Russian
situation.  He led up to the assertion that to go to Russia, to see
Russia, to try to grasp the broad outline of the Russian process,
was the manifest duty of every responsible intelligence that was
free to do as much.  And so he was going, and if Prothero cared to
come too--
<P>
"Yes," said Prothero, "I should like to go to Russia."
<P>
<P>
<P>
13
<P>
<P>
But throughout all their travel together that summer Benham was
never able to lift Prothero away from his obsession.  It was the
substance of their talk as the Holland boat stood out past waiting
destroyers and winking beacons and the lights of Harwich, into the
smoothly undulating darkness of the North Sea; it rose upon them
again as they sat over the cakes and cheese of a Dutch breakfast in
the express for Berlin.  Prothero filled the Sieges Allee with his
complaints against nature and society, and distracted Benham in his
contemplation of Polish agriculture from the windows of the train
with turgid sexual liberalism.  So that Benham, during this period
until Prothero left him and until the tragic enormous spectacle of
Russia in revolution took complete possession of him, was as it were
thinking upon two floors.  Upon the one he was thinking of the vast
problems of a society of a hundred million people staggering on the
verge of anarchy, and upon the other he was perplexed by the
feverish inattention of Prothero to the tremendous things that were
going on all about them.  It was only presently when the serenity of
his own private life began to be ruffled by disillusionment, that he
began to realize the intimate connexion of these two systems of
thought.  Yet Prothero put it to him plainly enough.
<P>
"Inattentive," said Prothero, "of course I am inattentive.  What is
really the matter with all this--this social mess people are in
here, is that nearly everybody is inattentive.  These Big Things of
yours, nobody is thinking of them really.  Everybody is thinking
about the Near Things that concern himself."
<P>
"The bombs they threw yesterday?  The Cossacks and the whips?"
<P>
"Nudges.  Gestures of inattention.  If everybody was thinking of the
Res Publica would there be any need for bombs?"
<P>
He pursued his advantage.  "It's all nonsense to suppose people
think of politics because they are in ‘em.  As well suppose that the
passengers on a liner understand the engines, or soldiers a war.
Before men can think of to-morrow, they must think of to-day.
Before they can think of others, they must be sure about themselves.
First of all, food; the private, the personal economic worry.  Am I
safe for food?  Then sex, and until one is tranquil and not ashamed,
not irritated and dissatisfied, how can one care for other people,
or for next year or the Order of the World?  How can one, Benham?"
<P>
He seized the illustration at hand.  "Here we are in Warsaw--not a
month after bomb-throwing and Cossack charging.  Windows have still
to be mended, smashed doors restored.  There's blood-stains still on
some of the houses.  There are hundreds of people in the Citadel and
in the Ochrana prison.  This morning there were executions.  Is it
anything more than an eddy in the real life of the place?  Watch the
customers in the shops, the crowd in the streets, the men in the
cafes who stare at the passing women.  They are all swallowed up
again in their own business.  They just looked up as the Cossacks
galloped past; they just shifted a bit when the bullets spat. . . ."
<P>
And when the streets of Moscow were agog with the grotesque amazing
adventure of the Potemkin mutineers, Prothero was in the full tide
of the private romance that severed him from Benham and sent him
back to Cambridge--changed.
<P>
Before they reached Moscow Benham was already becoming accustomed to
disregard Prothero.  He was looking over him at the vast heaving
trouble of Russia, which now was like a sea that tumbles under the
hurrying darknesses of an approaching storm.  In those days it
looked as though it must be an overwhelming storm.  He was drinking
in the wide and massive Russian effects, the drifting crowds in the
entangling streets, the houses with their strange lettering in black
and gold, the innumerable barbaric churches, the wildly driven
droshkys, the sombre red fortress of the Kremlin, with its bulbous
churches clustering up into the sky, the crosses, the innumerable
gold crosses, the mad church of St. Basil, carrying the Russian note
beyond the pitch of permissible caricature, and in this setting the
obscure drama of clustering, staring, sash-wearing peasants, long-
haired students, sane-eyed women, a thousand varieties of uniform, a
running and galloping to and fro of messengers, a flutter of little
papers, whispers, shouts, shots, a drama elusive and portentous, a
gathering of forces, an accumulation of tension going on to a
perpetual clash and clamour of bells.  Benham had brought letters of
introduction to a variety of people, some had vanished, it seemed.
They were "away," the porters said, and they continued to be
"away,"--it was the formula, he learnt, for arrest; others were
evasive, a few showed themselves extraordinarily anxious to inform
him about things, to explain themselves and things about them
exhaustively.  One young student took him to various meetings and
showed him in great detail the scene of the recent murder of the
Grand Duke Sergius.  The buildings opposite the old French cannons
were still under repair.  "The assassin stood just here.  The bomb
fell there, look! right down there towards the gate; that was where
they found his arm.  He was torn to fragments.  He was scraped up.
He was mixed with the horses. . . ."
<P>
Every one who talked spoke of the outbreak of revolution as a matter
of days or at the utmost weeks.  And whatever question Benham chose
to ask these talkers were prepared to answer.  Except one.  "And
after the revolution," he asked, "what then? . . ."  Then they waved
their hands, and failed to convey meanings by reassuring gestures.
<P>
He was absorbed in his effort to understand this universal ominous
drift towards a conflict.  He was trying to piece together a
process, if it was one and the same process, which involved riots in
Lodz, fighting at Libau, wild disorder at Odessa, remote colossal
battlings in Manchuria, the obscure movements of a disastrous fleet
lost somewhere now in the Indian seas, steaming clumsily to its
fate, he was trying to rationalize it all in his mind, to comprehend
its direction.  He was struggling strenuously with the obscurities
of the language in which these things were being discussed about
him, a most difficult language demanding new sets of visual images
because of its strange alphabet.  Is it any wonder that for a time
he failed to observe that Prothero was involved in some entirely
disconnected affair.
<P>
They were staying at the big Cosmopolis bazaar in the Theatre
Square.  Thither, through the doors that are opened by distraught-
looking men with peacocks' feathers round their caps, came Benham's
friends and guides to take him out and show him this and that.  At
first Prothero always accompanied Benham on these expeditions; then
he began to make excuses.  He would stay behind in the hotel.  Then
when Benham returned Prothero would have disappeared.  When the
porter was questioned about Prothero his nescience was profound.
<P>
One night no Prothero was discoverable at any hour, and Benham, who
wanted to discuss a project for going on to Kieff and Odessa, was
alarmed.
<P>
"Moscow is a late place," said Benham's student friend.  "You need
not be anxious until after four or five in the morning.  It will be
quite time--QUITE time to be anxious to-morrow.  He may be--close at
hand."
<P>
When Benham hunted up Prothero in his room next morning he found him
sleepy and irritable.
<P>
"I don't trouble if YOU are late," said Prothero, sitting up in his
bed with a red resentful face and crumpled hair.  "I wasn't born
yesterday."
<P>
"I wanted to talk about leaving Moscow."
<P>
"I don't want to leave Moscow."
<P>
"But Odessa--Odessa is the centre of interest just now."
<P>
"I want to stay in Moscow."
<P>
Benham looked baffled.
<P>
Prothero stuck up his knees and rested his night-shirted arms upon
them.  "I don't want to leave Moscow," he said, "and I'm not going
to do so."
<P>
"But haven't we done--"
<P>
Prothero interrupted.  "You may.  But I haven't.  We're not after
the same things.  Things that interest you, Benham, don't interest
me.  I've found--different things."
<P>
His expression was extraordinarily defiant.
<P>
"I want," he went on, "to put our affairs on a different footing.
Now you've opened the matter we may as well go into it.  You were
good enough to bring me here. . . .  There was a sort of
understanding we were working together. . . .  We aren't. . . .  The
long and short of it is, Benham, I want to pay you for my journey
here and go on my own--independently."
<P>
His eye and voice achieved a fierceness that Benham found nearly
incredible in him.
<P>
Something that had got itself overlooked in the press of other
matters jerked back into Benham's memory.  It popped back so
suddenly that for an instant he wanted to laugh.  He turned towards
the window, picked his way among Prothero's carelessly dropped
garments, and stood for a moment staring into the square, with its
drifting, assembling and dispersing fleet of trains and its long
line of blue-coated IZVOSHTCHIKS.  Then he turned.
<P>
"Billy," he said, "didn't I see you the other evening driving
towards the Hermitage?"
<P>
"Yes," said Prothero, and added, "that's it."
<P>
"You were with a lady."
<P>
"And she IS a lady," said Prothero, so deeply moved that his face
twitched as though he was going to weep.
<P>
"She's a Russian?"
<P>
"She had an English mother.  Oh, you needn't stand there and look so
damned ironical!  She's--she's a woman.  She's a thing of
kindness. . . ."
<P>
He was too full to go on.
<P>
"Billy, old boy," said Benham, distressed, "I don't want to be
ironical--"
<P>
Prothero had got his voice again.
<P>
"You'd better know," he said, "you'd better know.  She's one of
those women who live in this hotel."
<P>
"Live in this hotel!"
<P>
"On the fourth floor.  Didn't you know?  It's the way in most of
these big Russian hotels.  They come down and sit about after lunch
and dinner.  A woman with a yellow ticket.  Oh!  I don't care.  I
don't care a rap.  She's been kind to me; she's--she's dear to me.
How are you to understand?  I shall stop in Moscow.  I shall take
her to England.  I can't live without her, Benham.  And then--  And
then you come worrying me to come to your damned Odessa!"
<P>
And suddenly this extraordinary young man put his hands to his face
as though he feared to lose it and would hold it on, and after an
apoplectic moment burst noisily into tears.  They ran between his
fingers.  "Get out of my room," he shouted, suffocatingly.  "What
business have you to come prying on me?"
<P>
Benham sat down on a chair in the middle of the room and stared
round-eyed at his friend.  His hands were in his pockets.  For a
time he said nothing.
<P>
"Billy," he began at last, and stopped again.  "Billy, in this
country somehow one wants to talk like a Russian.  Billy, my dear--
I'm not your father, I'm not your judge.  I'm--unreasonably fond of
you.  It's not my business to settle what is right or wrong for you.
If you want to stay in Moscow, stay in Moscow.  Stay here, and stay
as my guest. . . ."
<P>
He stopped and remained staring at his friend for a little space.
<P>
"I didn't know," said Prothero brokenly; "I didn't know it was
possible to get so fond of a person. . . ."
<P>
Benham stood up.  He had never found Prothero so attractive and so
abominable in his life before.
<P>
"I shall go to Odessa alone, Billy.  I'll make things all right here
before I go. . . ."
<P>
He closed the door behind him and went in a state of profound
thought to his own room. . . .
<P>
Presently Prothero came to him with a vague inopportune desire to
explain what so evidently did not need explaining.  He walked about
the room trying ways of putting it, while Benham packed.
<P>
In an unaccountable way Prothero's bristling little mind seemed to
have shrunken to something sleek and small.
<P>
"I wish," he said, "you could stay for a later train and have lunch
and meet her.  She's not the ordinary thing.  She's--different."
<P>
Benham plumbed depths of wisdom.  "Billy," he said, "no woman IS the
ordinary thing.  They are all--different. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
14
<P>
<P>
For a time this affair of Prothero's seemed to be a matter as
disconnected from the Research Magnificent as one could imagine any
matter to be.  While Benham went from Moscow and returned, and
travelled hither and thither, and involved himself more and more in
the endless tangled threads of the revolutionary movement in Russia,
Prothero was lost to all those large issues in the development of
his personal situation.  He contributed nothing to Benham's thought
except attempts at discouragement.  He reiterated his declaration
that all the vast stress and change of Russian national life was
going on because it was universally disregarded.  "I tell you, as I
told you before, that nobody is attending.  You think because all
Moscow, all Russia, is in the picture, that everybody is concerned.
Nobody is concerned.  Nobody cares what is happening.  Even the men
who write in newspapers and talk at meetings about it don't care.
They are thinking of their dinners, of their clothes, of their
money, of their wives.  They hurry home. . . ."
<P>
That was his excuse.
<P>
Manifestly it was an excuse.
<P>
His situation developed into remarkable complications of jealousy
and divided counsels that Benham found altogether incomprehensible.
To Benham in those days everything was very simple in this business
of love.  The aristocrat had to love ideally; that was all.  He had
to love Amanda.  He and Amanda were now very deeply in love again,
more in love, he felt, than they had ever been before.  They were
now writing love-letters to each other and enjoying a separation
that was almost voluptuous.  She found in the epistolatory treatment
of her surrender to him and to the natural fate of women, a
delightful exercise for her very considerable powers of expression.
Life pointed now wonderfully to the great time ahead when there
would be a Cheetah cub in the world, and meanwhile the Cheetah loped
about the wild world upon a mighty quest.  In such terms she put it.
Such foolishness written in her invincibly square and youthful hand
went daily from London to Russia, and stacked up against his return
in the porter's office at the Cosmopolis Bazaar or pursued him down
through the jarring disorders of south-west Russia, or waited for
him at ill-chosen post-offices that deflected his journeyings
wastefully or in several instances went altogether astray.  Perhaps
they supplied self-educating young strikers in the postal service
with useful exercises in the deciphering of manuscript English.  He
wrote back five hundred different ways of saying that he loved her
extravagantly. . . .
<P>
It seemed to Benham in those days that he had found the remedy and
solution of all those sexual perplexities that distressed the world;
Heroic Love to its highest note--and then you go about your
business.  It seemed impossible not to be happy and lift one's chin
high and diffuse a bracing kindliness among the unfortunate
multitudes who stewed in affliction and hate because they had failed
as yet to find this simple, culminating elucidation.  And Prothero--
Prothero, too, was now achieving the same grand elementariness, out
of his lusts and protests and general physical squalor he had
flowered into love.  For a time it is true it made rather an
ineffective companion of him, but this was the mere goose-stepping
for the triumphal march; this way ultimately lay exaltation.  Benham
had had as yet but a passing glimpse of this Anglo-Russian, who was
a lady and altogether unlike her fellows; he had seen her for a
doubtful second or so as she and Prothero drove past him, and his
impression was of a rather little creature, white-faced with dusky
hair under a red cap, paler and smaller but with something in her, a
quiet alertness, that gave her a touch of kinship with Amanda.  And
if she liked old Prothero--  And, indeed, she must like old Prothero
or could she possibly have made him so deeply in love with her?
<P>
They must stick to each other, and then, presently, Prothero's soul
would wake up and face the world again.  What did it matter what she
had been?
<P>
Through stray shots and red conflict, long tediums of strained
anxiety and the physical dangers of a barbaric country staggering
towards revolution, Benham went with his own love like a lamp within
him and this affair of Prothero's reflecting its light, and he was
quite prepared for the most sympathetic and liberal behaviour when
he came back to Moscow to make the lady's acquaintance.  He intended
to help Prothero to marry and take her back to Cambridge, and to
assist by every possible means in destroying and forgetting the
official yellow ticket that defined her status in Moscow.  But he
reckoned without either Prothero or the young lady in this
expectation.
<P>
It only got to him slowly through his political preoccupations that
there were obscure obstacles to this manifest course.  Prothero
hesitated; the lady expressed doubts.
<P>
On closer acquaintance her resemblance to Amanda diminished.  It was
chiefly a similarity of complexion.  She had a more delicate face
than Amanda, and its youthful brightness was deadened; she had none
of Amanda's glow, and she spoke her mother's language with a pretty
halting limp that was very different from Amanda's clear decisions.
<P>
She put her case compactly.
<P>
"I would not DO in Cambridge," she said with an infinitesimal glance
at Prothero.
<P>
"Mr. Benham," she said, and her manner had the gravity of a woman of
affairs," now do you see me in Cambridge?  Now do you see me?  Kept
outside the walls?  In a little DATCHA?  With no occupation?  Just
to amuse him."
<P>
And on another occasion when Prothero was not with her she achieved
still completer lucidity.
<P>
"I would come if I thought he wanted me to come," she said.  "But
you see if I came he would not want me to come.  Because then he
would have me and so he wouldn't want me.  He would just have the
trouble.  And I am not sure if I should be happy in Cambridge.  I am
not sure I should be happy enough to make him happy.  It is a very
learned and intelligent and charming society, of course; but here,
THINGS HAPPEN.  At Cambridge nothing happens--there is only
education.  There is no revolution in Cambridge; there are not even
sinful people to be sorry for. . . .  And he says himself that
Cambridge people are particular.  He says they are liberal but very,
very particular, and perhaps I could not always act my part well.
Sometimes I am not always well behaved.  When there is music I
behave badly sometimes, or when I am bored.  He says the Cambridge
people are so liberal that they do not mind what you are, but he
says they are so particular that they mind dreadfully how you are
what you are. . . .  So that it comes to exactly the same
thing. . . ."
<P>
"Anna Alexievna," said Benham suddenly, "are you in love with
Prothero?"
<P>
Her manner became conscientiously scientific.
<P>
"He is very kind and very generous--too generous.  He keeps sending
for more money--hundreds of roubles, I try to prevent him."
<P>
"Were you EVER in love?"
<P>
"Of course.  But it's all gone long ago.  It was like being hungry.
Only very fine hungry.  Exquisite hungry. . . .  And then being
disgusted. . . ."
<P>
"He is in love with you."
<P>
"What is love?" said Anna.  "He is grateful.  He is by nature
grateful."  She smiled a smile, like the smile of a pale Madonna who
looks down on her bambino.
<P>
"And you love nothing?"
<P>
"I love Russia--and being alone, being completely alone.  When I am
dead perhaps I shall be alone.  Not even my own body will touch me
then."
<P>
Then she added, "But I shall be sorry when he goes."
<P>
Afterwards Benham talked to Prothero alone.  "Your Anna," he said,
"is rather wonderful.  At first, I tell you now frankly I did not
like her very much, I thought she looked ‘used,' she drank vodka at
lunch, she was gay, uneasily; she seemed a sham thing.  All that was
prejudice.  She thinks; she's generous, she's fine."
<P>
"She's tragic," said Prothero as though it was the same thing.
<P>
He spoke as though he noted an objection.  His next remark confirmed
this impression.  "That's why I can't take her back to Cambridge,"
he said.
<P>
"You see, Benham," he went on, "she's human.  She's not really
feminine.  I mean, she's--unsexed.  She isn't fitted to be a wife or
a mother any more.  We've talked about the possible life in England,
very plainly.  I've explained what a household in Cambridge would
mean. . . .  It doesn't attract her. . . .  In a way she's been let
out from womanhood, forced out of womanhood, and I see now that when
women are let out from womanhood there's no putting them back.  I
could give a lecture on Anna.  I see now that if women are going to
be wives and mothers and homekeepers and ladies, they must be got
ready for it from the beginning, sheltered, never really let out
into the wild chances of life.  She has been.  Bitterly.  She's
REALLY emancipated.  And it's let her out into a sort of
nothingness.  She's no longer a woman, and she isn't a man.  She
ought to be able to go on her own--like a man.  But I can't take her
back to Cambridge.  Even for her sake."
<P>
His perplexed eyes regarded Benham.
<P>
"You won't be happy in Cambridge--alone," said Benham.
<P>
"Oh, damnably not!  But what can I do?  I had at first some idea of
coming to Moscow for good--teaching."
<P>
He paused.  "Impossible.  I'm worth nothing here.  I couldn't have
kept her."
<P>
"Then what are you going to do, Billy?"
<P>
"I don't KNOW what I'm going to do, I tell you.  I live for the
moment.  To-morrow we are going out into the country."
<P>
"I don't understand," said Benham with a gesture of resignation.
"It seems to me that if a man and woman love each other--well, they
insist upon each other.  What is to happen to her if you leave her
in Moscow?"
<P>
"Damnation!  Is there any need to ask that?"
<P>
"Take her to Cambridge, man.  And if Cambridge objects, teach
Cambridge better manners."
<P>
Prothero's face was suddenly transfigured with rage.
<P>
"I tell you she won't come!" he said.
<P>
"Billy!" said Benham, "you should make her!"
<P>
"I can't."
<P>
"If a man loves a woman he can make her do anything--"
<P>
"But I don't love her like that," said Prothero, shrill with anger.
"I tell you I don't love her like that."
<P>
Then he lunged into further deeps.  "It's the other men," he said,
"it's the things that have been.  Don't you understand?  Can't you
understand?  The memories--she must have memories--they come between
us.  It's something deeper than reason.  It's in one's spine and
under one's nails.  One could do anything, I perceive, for one's
very own woman. . . ."
<P>
"MAKE her your very own woman, said the exponent of heroic love.
<P>
"I shirk deeds, Benham, but you shirk facts.  How could any man make
her his very own woman now?  You--you don't seem to understand--
ANYTHING.  She's nobody's woman--for ever.  That--that might-have-
been has gone for ever. . . .  It's nerves--a passion of the nerves.
There's a cruelty in life and--  She's KIND to me.  She's so kind to
me. . . ."
<P>
And then again Prothero was weeping like a vexed child.
<P>
<P>
<P>
15
<P>
<P>
The end of Prothero's first love affair came to Benham in broken
fragments in letters.  When he looked for Anna Alexievna in
December--he never learnt her surname--he found she had left the
Cosmopolis Bazaar soon after Prothero's departure and he could not
find whither she had gone.  He never found her again.  Moscow and
Russia had swallowed her up.
<P>
Of course she and Prothero parted; that was a foregone conclusion.
But Prothero's manner of parting succeeded in being at every phase a
shock to Benham's ideas.  It was clear he went off almost callously;
it would seem there was very little crying.  Towards the end it was
evident that the two had quarrelled.  The tears only came at the
very end of all.  It was almost as if he had got through the passion
and was glad to go.  Then came regret, a regret that increased in
geometrical proportion with every mile of distance.
<P>
In Warsaw it was that grief really came to Prothero.  He had some
hours there and he prowled the crowded streets, seeing girls and
women happy with their lovers, abroad upon bright expeditions and
full of delicious secrets, girls and women who ever and again
flashed out some instant resemblance to Anna. . . .
<P>
In Berlin he stopped a night and almost decided that he would go
back.  "But now I had the damned frontier," he wrote, "between us."
<P>
It was so entirely in the spirit of Prothero, Benham thought, to let
the "damned frontier" tip the balance against him.
<P>
Then came a scrawl of passionate confession, so passionate that it
seemed as if Prothero had been transfigured.  "I can't stand this
business," he wrote.  "It has things in it, possibilities of
emotional disturbance--you can have no idea!  In the train--luckily
I was alone in the compartment--I sat and thought, and suddenly, I
could not help it, I was weeping--noisy weeping, an uproar!  A
beastly German came and stood in the corridor to stare.  I had to
get out of the train.  It is disgraceful, it is monstrous we should
be made like this. . . .
<P>
"Here I am stranded in Hanover with nothing to do but to write to
you about my dismal feelings. . . ."
<P>
After that surely there was nothing before a broken-hearted Prothero
but to go on with his trailing wing to Trinity and a life of
inappeasable regrets; but again Benham reckoned without the
invincible earthliness of his friend.  Prothero stayed three nights
in Paris.
<P>
"There is an extraordinary excitement about Paris," he wrote.  "A
levity.  I suspect the gypsum in the subsoil--some as yet
undescribed radiations.  Suddenly the world looks brightly
cynical. . . .  None of those tear-compelling German emanations. . . .
<P>
"And, Benham, I have found a friend.
<P>
"A woman.  Of course you will laugh, you will sneer.  You do not
understand these things. . . .  Yet they are so simple.  It was the
strangest accident brought us together.  There was something that
drew us together.  A sort of instinct.  Near the Boulevard
Poissoniere. . . ."
<P>
"Good heavens!" said Benham.  "A sort of instinct!"
<P>
"I told her all about Anna!"
<P>
"Good Lord!" cried Benham.
<P>
"She understood.  Perfectly.  None of your so-called ‘respectable'
women could have understood. . . .  At first I intended merely to
talk to her. . . ."
<P>
Benham crumpled the letter in his hand.
<P>
"Little Anna Alexievna!" he said, "you were too clean for him."
<P>
<P>
<P>
16
<P>
<P>
Benham had a vision of Prothero returning from all this foreign
travel meekly, pensively, a little sadly, and yet not without a kind
of relief, to the grey mildness of Trinity.  He saw him, capped and
gowned, and restored to academic dignity again, nodding greetings,
resuming friendships.
<P>
The little man merged again into his rare company of discreet
Benedicts and restrained celibates at the high tables.  They ate on
in their mature wisdom long after the undergraduates had fled.
Presently they would withdraw processionally to the combination
room. . . .
<P>
There would be much to talk about over the wine.
<P>
Benham speculated what account Prothero would give of Moscow. . . .
<P>
He laughed abruptly.
<P>
And with that laugh Prothero dropped out of Benham's world for a
space of years.  There may have been other letters, but if so they
were lost in the heaving troubles of a revolution-strained post-
office.  Perhaps to this day they linger sere and yellow in some
forgotten pigeon-hole in Kishinev or Ekaterinoslav. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
17
<P>
<P>
In November, after an adventure in the trader's quarter of Kieff
which had brought him within an inch of death, and because an
emotional wave had swept across him and across his correspondence
with Amanda, Benham went back suddenly to England and her.  He
wanted very greatly to see her and also he wanted to make certain
arrangements about his property.  He returned by way of Hungary, and
sent telegrams like shouts of excitement whenever the train stopped
for a sufficient time.  "Old Leopard, I am coming, I am coming," he
telegraphed, announcing his coming for the fourth time.  It was to
be the briefest of visits, very passionate, the mutual refreshment
of two noble lovers, and then he was returning to Russia again.
<P>
Amanda was at Chexington, and there he found her installed in the
utmost dignity of expectant maternity.  Like many other people he
had been a little disposed to regard the bearing of children as a
common human experience; at Chexington he came to think of it as a
rare and sacramental function.  Amanda had become very beautiful in
quiet, grey, dove-like tones; her sun-touched, boy's complexion had
given way to a soft glow of the utmost loveliness, her brisk little
neck that had always reminded him of the stalk of a flower was now
softened and rounded; her eyes were tender, and she moved about the
place in the manner of one who is vowed to a great sacrifice.  She
dominated the scene, and Lady Marayne, with a certain astonishment
in her eyes and a smouldering disposition to irony, was the half-
sympathetic, half-resentful priestess of her daughter-in-law's
unparalleled immolation.  The MOTIF of motherhood was everywhere,
and at his bedside he found--it had been put there for him by
Amanda--among much other exaltation of woman's mission, that most
wonderful of all philoprogenitive stories, Hudson's CRYSTAL AGE.
<P>
Everybody at Chexington had an air of being grouped about the
impending fact.  An epidemic of internal troubles, it is true, kept
Sir Godfrey in the depths of London society, but to make up for his
absence Mrs. Morris had taken a little cottage down by the river and
the Wilder girls were with her, both afire with fine and subtle
feelings and both, it seemed, and more particularly Betty, prepared
to be keenly critical of Benham's attitude.
<P>
He did a little miss his cue in these exaltations, because he had
returned in a rather different vein of exaltation.
<P>
In missing it he was assisted by Amanda herself, who had at moments
an effect upon him of a priestess confidentially disrobed.  It was
as if she put aside for him something official, something sincerely
maintained, necessary, but at times a little irksome.  It was as if
she was glad to take him into her confidence and unbend.  Within the
pre-natal Amanda an impish Amanda still lingered.
<P>
There were aspects of Amanda that it was manifest dear Betty must
never know. . . .
<P>
But the real Amanda of that November visit even in her most
unpontifical moods did not quite come up to the imagined Amanda who
had drawn him home across Europe.  At times she was extraordinarily
jolly.  They had two or three happy walks about the Chexington
woods; that year the golden weather of October had flowed over into
November, and except for a carpet of green and gold under the horse-
chestnuts most of the leaves were still on the trees.  Gleams of her
old wanton humour shone on him.  And then would come something else,
something like a shadow across the world, something he had quite
forgotten since his idea of heroic love had flooded him, something
that reminded him of those long explanations with Mr. Rathbone-
Sanders that had never been explained, and of the curate in the
doorway of the cottage and his unaccountable tears.
<P>
On the afternoon of his arrival at Chexington he was a little
surprised to find Sir Philip Easton coming through the house into
the garden, with an accustomed familiarity.  Sir Philip perceived
him with a start that was instantly controlled, and greeted him with
unnatural ease.
<P>
Sir Philip, it seemed, was fishing and reading and playing cricket
in the neighbourhood, which struck Benham as a poor way of spending
the summer, the sort of soft holiday a man learns to take from
scholars and literary men.  A man like Sir Philip, he thought, ought
to have been aviating or travelling.
<P>
Moreover, when Sir Philip greeted Amanda it seemed to Benham that
there was a flavour of established association in their manner.  But
then Sir Philip was also very assiduous with Lady Marayne.  She
called him "Pip," and afterwards Amanda called across the tennis-
court to him, "Pip!"  And then he called her "Amanda."  When the
Wilder girls came up to join the tennis he was just as brotherly. . . .
<P>
The next day he came to lunch.
<P>
During that meal Benham became more aware than he had ever been
before of the peculiar deep expressiveness of this young man's eyes.
They watched him and they watched Amanda with a solicitude that
seemed at once pained and tender.  And there was something about
Amanda, a kind of hard brightness, an impartiality and an air of
something undefinably suspended, that gave Benham an intuitive
certitude that that afternoon Sir Philip would be spoken to
privately, and that then he would pack up and go away in a state of
illumination from Chexington.  But before he could be spoken to he
contrived to speak to Benham.
<P>
They were left to smoke after lunch, and then it was he took
advantage of a pause to commit his little indiscretion.
<P>
"Mrs. Benham," he said, "looks amazingly well--extraordinarily well,
don't you think?"
<P>
"Yes," said Benham, startled.  "Yes.  She certainly keeps very
well."
<P>
"She misses you terribly," said Sir Philip; "it is a time when a
woman misses her husband.  But, of course, she does not want to
hamper your work. . . ."
<P>
Benham felt it was very kind of him to take so intimate an interest
in these matters, but on the spur of the moment he could find no
better expression for this than a grunt.
<P>
"You don't mind," said the young man with a slight catch in the
breath that might have been apprehensive, "that I sometimes bring
her books and flowers and things?  Do what little I can to keep life
interesting down here?  It's not very congenial. . . .  She's so
wonderful--I think she is the most wonderful woman in the world."
<P>
Benham perceived that so far from being a modern aristocrat he was
really a primitive barbarian in these matters.
<P>
"I've no doubt," he said, "that my wife has every reason to be
grateful for your attentions."
<P>
In the little pause that followed Benham had a feeling that Sir
Philip was engendering something still more personal.  If so, he
might be constrained to invert very gently but very firmly the bowl
of chrysanthemums over Sir Philip's head, or kick him in an
improving manner.  He had a ridiculous belief that Sir Philip would
probably take anything of the sort very touchingly.  He scrambled in
his mind for some remark that would avert this possibility.
<P>
"Have you ever been in Russia?" he asked hastily.  "It is the most
wonderful country in Europe.  I had an odd adventure near Kiev.
During a pogrom."
<P>
And he drowned the developing situation in a flood of description. . . .
<P>
But it was not so easy to drown the little things that were
presently thrown out by Lady Marayne.  They were so much more in the
air. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
18
<P>
<P>
Sir Philip suddenly got out of the picture even as Benham had
foreseen.
<P>
"Easton has gone away," he remarked three days later to Amanda.
<P>
"I told him to go.  He is a bore with you about.  But otherwise he
is rather a comfort, Cheetah." She meditated upon Sir Philip.  "And
he's an HONOURABLE man," she said.  "He's safe. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
19
<P>
<P>
After that visit it was that the notes upon love and sex began in
earnest.  The scattered memoranda upon the perfectness of heroic
love for the modern aristocrat ended abruptly.  Instead there came
the first draft for a study of jealousy.  The note was written in
pencil on Chexington notepaper and manifestly that had been
supported on the ribbed cover of a book.  There was a little
computation in the corner, converting forty-five degrees Reaumur
into degrees Fahrenheit, which made White guess it had been written
in the Red Sea.  But, indeed, it had been written in a rather
amateurishly stoked corridor-train on Benham's journey to the
gathering revolt in Moscow. . . .
<P>
"I think I have been disposed to underrate the force of sexual
jealousy. . . .  I thought it was something essentially
contemptible, something that one dismissed and put behind oneself in
the mere effort to be aristocratic, but I begin to realize that it
is not quite so easily settled with. . . .
<P>
"One likes to know. . . .  Possibly one wants to know too
much. . . .  In phases of fatigue, and particularly in phases of
sleeplessness, when one is leaving all that one cares for behind, it
becomes an irrational torment. . . .
<P>
"And it is not only in oneself that I am astonished by the power of
this base motive.  I see, too, in the queer business of Prothero how
strongly jealousy, how strongly the sense of proprietorship, weighs
with a man. . . .
<P>
"There is no clear reason why one should insist upon another human
being being one's ownest own--utterly one's own. . . .
<P>
"There is, of course, no clear reason for most human motives. . . .
<P>
"One does. . . .
<P>
"There is something dishonouring in distrust--to both the distrusted
and the one who distrusts. . . ."
<P>
After that, apparently, it had been too hot and stuffy to continue.
<P>
<P>
<P>
20
<P>
<P>
Benham did not see Amanda again until after the birth of their
child.  He spent his Christmas in Moscow, watching the outbreak, the
fitful fighting and the subsequent break-up, of the revolution, and
taking care of a lost and helpless English family whose father had
gone astray temporarily on the way home from Baku.  Then he went
southward to Rostov and thence to Astrakhan.  Here he really began
his travels.  He determined to get to India by way of Herat and for
the first time in his life rode out into an altogether lawless
wilderness.  He went on obstinately because he found himself
disposed to funk the journey, and because discouragements were put
in his way.  He was soon quite cut off from all the ways of living
he had known.  He learnt what it is to be flea-bitten, saddle-sore,
hungry and, above all, thirsty.  He was haunted by a dread of fever,
and so contrived strange torments for himself with overdoses of
quinine.  He ceased to be traceable from Chexington in March, and he
reappeared in the form of a telegram from Karachi demanding news in
May.  He learnt he was the father of a man-child and that all was
well with Amanda.
<P>
He had not expected to be so long away from any communication with
the outer world, and something in the nature of a stricken
conscience took him back to England.  He found a second William
Porphyry in the world, dominating Chexington, and Amanda tenderly
triumphant and passionate, the Madonna enthroned.  For William
Porphyry he could feel no emotion.  William Porphyry was very red
and ugly and protesting, feeble and aggressive, a matter for a
skilled nurse.  To see him was to ignore him and dispel a dream.  It
was to Amanda Benham turned again.
<P>
For some days he was content to adore his Madonna and listen to the
familiar flatteries of her love.  He was a leaner, riper man, Amanda
said, and wiser, so that she was afraid of him. . . .
<P>
And then he became aware that she was requiring him to stay at her
side.  "We have both had our adventures," she said, which struck him
as an odd phrase.
<P>
It forced itself upon his obstinate incredulity that all those
conceptions of heroic love and faithfulness he had supposed to be so
clearly understood between them had vanished from her mind.  She had
absolutely forgotten that twilight moment at the window which had
seemed to him the crowning instant, the real marriage of their
lives.  It had gone, it had left no recoverable trace in her.  And
upon his interpretations of that he had loved her passionately for a
year.  She was back at exactly the ideas and intentions that ruled
her during their first settlement in London.  She wanted a joint
life in the social world of London, she demanded his presence, his
attention, the daily practical evidences of love.  It was all very
well for him to be away when the child was coming, but now
everything was different.  Now he must stay by her.
<P>
This time he argued no case.  These issues he had settled for ever.
Even an indignant dissertation from Lady Marayne, a dissertation
that began with appeals and ended in taunts, did not move him.
Behind these things now was India.  The huge problems of India had
laid an unshakeable hold upon his imagination.  He had seen Russia,
and he wanted to balance that picture by a vision of the east. . . .
<P>
He saw Easton only once during a week-end at Chexington.  The young
man displayed no further disposition to be confidentially
sentimental.  But he seemed to have something on his mind.  And
Amanda said not a word about him.  He was a young man above
suspicion, Benham felt. . . .
<P>
And from his departure the quality of the correspondence of these
two larger carnivores began to change.  Except for the repetition of
accustomed endearments, they ceased to be love letters in any sense
of the word.  They dealt chiefly with the "Cub," and even there
Benham felt presently that the enthusiasm diminished.  A new amazing
quality for Amanda appeared--triteness.  The very writing of her
letters changed as though it had suddenly lost backbone.  Her
habitual liveliness of phrasing lost its point.  Had she lost her
animation?  Was she ill unknowingly?  Where had the light gone?  It
was as if her attention was distracted. . . .  As if every day when
she wrote her mind was busy about something else.
<P>
Abruptly at last he understood.  A fact that had never been stated,
never formulated, never in any way admitted, was suddenly pointed to
convergently by a thousand indicating fingers, and beyond question
perceived to be THERE. . . .
<P>
He left a record of that moment of realization.
<P>
"Suddenly one night I woke up and lay still, and it was as if I had
never seen Amanda before.  Now I saw her plainly, I saw her with
that same dreadful clearness that sometimes comes at dawn, a
pitiless, a scientific distinctness that has neither light nor
shadow. . . .
<P>
"Of course," I said, and then presently I got up very softly. . . .
<P>
"I wanted to get out of my intolerable, close, personal cabin.  I
wanted to feel the largeness of the sky.  I went out upon the deck.
We were off the coast of Madras, and when I think of that moment,
there comes back to me also the faint flavour of spice in the air,
the low line of the coast, the cool flooding abundance of the Indian
moonlight, the swish of the black water against the side of the
ship.  And a perception of infinite loss, as if the limitless
heavens above this earth and below to the very uttermost star were
just one boundless cavity from which delight had fled. . . .
<P>
"Of course I had lost her.  I knew it with absolute certainty.  I
knew it from her insecure temperament, her adventurousness, her
needs.  I knew it from every line she had written me in the last
three months.  I knew it intuitively.  She had been unfaithful.  She
must have been unfaithful.
<P>
"What had I been dreaming about to think that it would not be so?"
<P>
<P>
<P>
21
<P>
<P>
"Now let me write down plainly what I think of these matters.  Let
me be at least honest with myself, whatever self-contradictions I
may have been led into by force of my passions.  Always I have
despised jealousy. . . .
<P>
"Only by the conquest of four natural limitations is the
aristocratic life to be achieved.  They come in a certain order, and
in that order the spirit of man is armed against them less and less
efficiently.  Of fear and my struggle against fear I have told
already.  I am fearful.  I am a physical coward until I can bring
shame and anger to my assistance, but in overcoming fear I have been
helped by the whole body of human tradition.  Every one, the basest
creatures, every Hottentot, every stunted creature that ever
breathed poison in a slum, knows that the instinctive constitution
of man is at fault here and that fear is shameful and must be
subdued.  The race is on one's side.  And so there is a vast
traditional support for a man against the Second Limitation, the
limitation of physical indulgence.  It is not so universal as the
first, there is a grinning bawling humour on the side of grossness,
but common pride is against it.  And in this matter my temperament
has been my help: I am fastidious, I eat little, drink little, and
feel a shivering recoil from excess.  It is no great virtue; it
happens so; it is something in the nerves of my skin.  I cannot
endure myself unshaven or in any way unclean; I am tormented by
dirty hands or dirty blood or dirty memories, and after I had once
loved Amanda I could not--unless some irrational impulse to get
equal with her had caught me--have broken my faith to her, whatever
breach there was in her faith to me. . . .
<P>
"I see that in these matters I am cleaner than most men and more
easily clean; and it may be that it is in the vein of just that
distinctive virtue that I fell so readily into a passion of
resentment and anger.
<P>
"I despised a jealous man.  There is a traditional discredit of
jealousy, not so strong as that against cowardice, but still very
strong.  But the general contempt of jealousy is curiously wrapped
up with the supposition that there is no cause for jealousy, that it
is unreasonable suspicion.  Given a cause then tradition speaks with
an uncertain voice. . . .
<P>
"I see now that I despised jealousy because I assumed that it was
impossible for Amanda to love any one but me; it was intolerable to
imagine anything else, I insisted upon believing that she was as
fastidious as myself and as faithful as myself, made indeed after my
image, and I went on disregarding the most obvious intimations that
she was not, until that still moment in the Indian Ocean, when
silently, gently as a drowned body might rise out of the depths of a
pool, that knowledge of love dead and honour gone for ever floated
up into my consciousness.
<P>
"And then I felt that Amanda had cheated me!  Outrageously.
Abominably.
<P>
"Now, so far as my intelligence goes, there is not a cloud upon this
question.  My demand upon Amanda was outrageous and I had no right
whatever to her love or loyalty.  I must have that very clear. . . .
<P>
"This aristocratic life, as I conceive it, must be, except
accidentally here and there, incompatible with the domestic life.
It means going hither and thither in the universe of thought as much
as in the universe of matter, it means adventure, it means movement
and adventure that must needs be hopelessly encumbered by an
inseparable associate, it means self-imposed responsibilities that
will not fit into the welfare of a family.  In all ages, directly
society had risen above the level of a barbaric tribal village, this
need of a release from the family for certain necessary types of
people has been recognized.  It was met sometimes informally,
sometimes formally, by the growth and establishment of special
classes and orders, of priests, monks, nuns, of pledged knights, of
a great variety of non-family people, whose concern was the larger
collective life that opens out beyond the simple necessities and
duties and loyalties of the steading and of the craftsman's house.
Sometimes, but not always, that release took the form of celibacy;
but besides that there have been a hundred institutional variations
of the common life to meet the need of the special man, the man who
must go deep and the man who must go far.  A vowed celibacy ceased
to be a tolerable rule for an aristocracy directly the eugenic idea
entered the mind of man, because a celibate aristocracy means the
abandonment of the racial future to a proletariat of base unleaderly
men.  That was plain to Plato.  It was plain to Campanelea.  It was
plain to the Protestant reformers.  But the world has never yet gone
on to the next step beyond that recognition, to the recognition of
feminine aristocrats, rulers and the mates of rulers, as
untrammelled by domestic servitudes and family relationships as the
men of their kind.  That I see has always been my idea since in my
undergraduate days I came under the spell of Plato.  It was a matter
of course that my first gift to Amanda should be his REPUBLIC.  I
loved Amanda transfigured in that dream. . . .
<P>
"There are no such women. . . .
<P>
"It is no excuse for me that I thought she was like-minded with
myself.  I had no sound reason for supposing that.  I did suppose
that.  I did not perceive that not only was she younger than myself,
but that while I had been going through a mill of steely education,
kept close, severely exercised, polished by discussion, she had but
the weak training of a not very good school, some scrappy reading,
the vague discussions of village artists, and the draped and
decorated novelties of the ‘advanced.'  It all went to nothing on
the impact of the world. . . .  She showed herself the woman the
world has always known, no miracle, and the alternative was for me
to give myself to her in the ancient way, to serve her happiness, to
control her and delight and companion her, or to let her go.
<P>
"The normal woman centres upon herself; her mission is her own charm
and her own beauty and her own setting; her place is her home.  She
demands the concentration of a man.  Not to be able to command that
is her failure.  Not to give her that is to shame her.  As I had
shamed Amanda. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
22
<P>
<P>
"There are no such women."  He had written this in and struck it
out, and then at some later time written it in again.  There it
stayed now as his last persuasion, but it set White thinking and
doubting.  And, indeed, there was another sheet of pencilled broken
stuff that seemed to glance at quite another type of womanhood.
<P>
<P>
<P>
23
<P>
<P>
"It is clear that the women aristocrats who must come to the
remaking of the world will do so in spite of limitations at least as
great as those from which the aristocratic spirit of man escapes.
These women must become aristocratic through their own innate
impulse, they must be self-called to their lives, exactly as men
must be; there is no making an aristocrat without a predisposition
for rule and nobility.  And they have to discover and struggle
against just exactly the limitations that we have to struggle
against.  They have to conquer not only fear but indulgence,
indulgence of a softer, more insidious quality, and jealousy--
proprietorship. . . .
<P>
"It is as natural to want a mate as to want bread, and a thousand
times in my work and in my wanderings I have thought of a mate and
desired a mate.  A mate--not a possession.  It is a need almost
naively simple.  If only one could have a woman who thought of one
and with one!  Though she were on the other side of the world and
busied about a thousand things. . . .
<P>
"‘WITH one,' I see it must be rather than ‘OF one.'  That ‘of one'
is just the unexpurgated egotistical demand coming back again. . . .
<P>
"Man is a mating creature.  It is not good to be alone.  But mating
means a mate. . . .
<P>
"We should be lovers, of course; that goes without saying. . . .
<P>
"And yet not specialized lovers, not devoted, ATTENDING lovers.
‘Dancing attendance'--as they used to say.  We should meet upon our
ways as the great carnivores do. . . .
<P>
"That at any rate was a sound idea.  Though we only played with it.
<P>
"But that mate desire is just a longing that can have no possible
satisfaction now for me.  What is the good of dreaming?  Life and
chance have played a trick upon my body and soul.  I am mated,
though I am mated to a phantom.  I loved and I love Arnanda, not
Easton's Amanda, but Amanda in armour, the Amanda of my dreams.
Sense, and particularly the sense of beauty, lies deeper than reason
in us.  There can be no mate for me now unless she comes with
Amanda's voice and Amanda's face and Amanda's quick movements and
her clever hands. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
24
<P>
<P>
"Why am I so ungrateful to her still for all the happiness she gave
me?
<P>
"There were things between us two as lovers,--love, things more
beautiful than anything else in the world, things that set the mind
hunting among ineffectual images in a search for impossible
expression, images of sunlight shining through blood-red petals,
images of moonlight in a scented garden, of marble gleaming in the
shade, of far-off wonderful music heard at dusk in a great
stillness, of fairies dancing softly, of floating happiness and
stirring delights, of joys as keen and sudden as the knife of an
assassin, assassin's knives made out of tears, tears that are
happiness, wordless things; and surprises, expectations, gratitudes,
sudden moments of contemplation, the sight of a soft eyelid closed
in sleep, shadowy tones in the sound of a voice heard unexpectedly;
sweet, dear magical things that I can find no words for. . . .
<P>
"If she was a goddess to me, should it be any affair of mine that
she was not a goddess to herself; that she could hold all this that
has been between us more cheaply than I did?  It does not change one
jot of it for me.  At the time she did not hold it cheaply.  She
forgets where I do not forget. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
25
<P>
<P>
Such were the things that Benham could think and set down.
<P>
Yet for whole days he was possessed by the thought of killing Amanda
and himself.
<P>
He did not at once turn homeward.  It was in Ceylon that he dropped
his work and came home.  At Colombo he found a heap of letters
awaiting him, and there were two of these that had started at the
same time.  They had been posted in London on one eventful
afternoon.  Lady Marayne and Amanda had quarrelled violently.  Two
earnest, flushed, quick-breathing women, full of neat but belated
repartee, separated to write their simultaneous letters.  Each
letter trailed the atmosphere of that truncated encounter.  Lady
Marayne told her story ruthlessly.  Amanda, on the other hand,
generalized, and explained.  Sir Philip's adoration of her was a
love-friendship, it was beautiful, it was pure.  Was there no trust
nor courage in the world?  She would defy all jealous scandal.  She
would not even banish him from her side.  Surely the Cheetah could
trust her.  But the pitiless facts of Lady Marayne went beyond
Amanda's explaining.  The little lady's dignity had been stricken.
"I have been used as a cloak," she wrote.
<P>
Her phrases were vivid.  She quoted the very words of Amanda, words
she had overheard at Chexington in the twilight.  They were no
invention.  They were the very essence of Amanda, the lover.  It was
as sure as if Benham had heard the sound of her voice, as if he had
peeped and seen, as if she had crept by him, stooping and rustling
softly.  It brought back the living sense of her, excited, flushed,
reckless; his wild-haired Amanda of infinite delight. . . .  All day
those words of hers pursued him.  All night they flared across the
black universe.  He buried his face in the pillows and they
whispered softly in his ear.
<P>
He walked his room in the darkness longing to smash and tear.
<P>
He went out from the house and shook his ineffectual fists at the
stirring quiet of the stars.
<P>
He sent no notice of his coming back.  Nor did he come back with a
definite plan.  But he wanted to get at Amanda.
<P>
<P>
<P>
26
<P>
<P>
It was with Amanda he had to reckon.  Towards Easton he felt
scarcely any anger at all.  Easton he felt only existed for him
because Amanda willed to have it so.
<P>
Such anger as Easton did arouse in him was a contemptuous anger.
His devotion filled Benham with scorn.  His determination to serve
Amanda at any price, to bear the grossest humiliations and slights
for her, his humility, his service and tenderness, his care for her
moods and happiness, seemed to Benham a treachery to human nobility.
That rage against Easton was like the rage of a trade-unionist
against a blackleg.  Are all the women to fall to the men who will
be their master-slaves and keepers?  But it was not simply that
Benham felt men must be freed from this incessant attendance; women
too must free themselves from their almost instinctive demand for an
attendant. . . .
<P>
His innate disposition was to treat women as responsible beings.
Never in his life had he thought of a woman as a pretty thing to be
fooled and won and competed for and fought over.  So that it was
Amanda he wanted to reach and reckon with now, Amanda who had mated
and ruled his senses only to fling him into this intolerable pit of
shame and jealous fury.  But the forces that were driving him home
now were the forces below the level of reason and ideas, organic
forces compounded of hate and desire, profound aboriginal urgencies.
He thought, indeed, very little as he lay in his berth or sulked on
deck; his mind lay waste under a pitiless invasion of exasperating
images that ever and again would so wring him that his muscles would
tighten and his hands clench or he would find himself restraining a
snarl, the threat of the beast, in his throat.
<P>
Amanda grew upon his imagination until she overshadowed the whole
world.  She filled the skies.  She bent over him and mocked him.
She became a mystery of passion and dark beauty.  She was the sin of
the world.  One breathed her in the winds of the sea.  She had taken
to herself the greatness of elemental things. . . .
<P>
So that when at last he saw her he was amazed to see her, and see
that she was just a creature of common size and quality, a rather
tired and very frightened-looking white-faced young woman, in an
evening-dress of unfamiliar fashion, with little common trinkets of
gold and colour about her wrists and neck.
<P>
In that instant's confrontation he forgot all that had brought him
homeward.  He stared at her as one stares at a stranger whom one has
greeted in mistake for an intimate friend.
<P>
For he saw that she was no more the Amanda he hated and desired to
kill than she had ever been the Amanda he had loved.
<P>
<P>
<P>
27
<P>
<P>
He took them by surprise.  It had been his intention to take them by
surprise.  Such is the inelegance of the jealous state.
<P>
He reached London in the afternoon and put up at a hotel near
Charing Cross.  In the evening about ten he appeared at the house in
Lancaster Gate.  The butler was deferentially amazed.  Mrs. Benham
was, he said, at a theatre with Sir Philip Easton, and he thought
some other people also.  He did not know when she would be back.
She might go on to supper.  It was not the custom for the servants
to wait up for her.
<P>
Benham went into the study that reduplicated his former rooms in
Finacue Street and sat down before the fire the butler lit for him.
He sent the man to bed, and fell into profound meditation.
<P>
It was nearly two o'clock when he heard the sound of her latchkey
and went out at once upon the landing.
<P>
The half-door stood open and Easton's car was outside.  She stood in
the middle of the hall and relieved Easton of the gloves and fan he
was carrying.
<P>
"Good-night," she said, "I am so tired."
<P>
"My wonderful goddess," he said.
<P>
She yielded herself to his accustomed embrace, then started, stared,
and wrenched herself out of his arms.
<P>
Benham stood at the top of the stairs looking down upon them, white-
faced and inexpressive.  Easton dropped back a pace.  For a moment
no one moved nor spoke, and then very quietly Easton shut the half-
door and shut out the noises of the road.
<P>
For some seconds Benham regarded them, and as he did so his spirit
changed. . . .
<P>
Everything he had thought of saying and doing vanished out of his
mind.
<P>
He stuck his hands into his pockets and descended the staircase.
When he was five or six steps above them, he spoke.  "Just sit down
here," he said, with a gesture of one hand, and sat down himself
upon the stairs.  "DO sit down," he said with a sudden testiness as
they continued standing.  "I know all about this affair.  Do please
sit down and let us talk. . . .  Everybody's gone to bed long ago."
<P>
"Cheetah!" she said.  "Why have you come back like this?"
<P>
Then at his mute gesture she sat down at his feet.
<P>
"I wish you would sit down, Easton," he said in a voice of subdued
savagery.
<P>
"Why have you come back?" Sir Philip Easton found his voice to ask.
<P>
"SIT down," Benham spat, and Easton obeyed unwillingly.
<P>
"I came back," Benham went on, "to see to all this.  Why else?  I
don't--now I see you--feel very fierce about it.  But it has
distressed me.  You look changed, Amanda, and fagged.  And your hair
is untidy.  It's as if something had happened to you and made you a
stranger. . . .  You two people are lovers.  Very natural and
simple, but I want to get out of it.  Yes, I want to get out of it.
That wasn't quite my idea, but now I see it is.  It's queer, but on
the whole I feel sorry for you.  All of us, poor humans--.  There's
reason to be sorry for all of us.  We're full of lusts and
uneasiness and resentments that we haven't the will to control.
What do you two people want me to do to you?  Would you like a
divorce, Amanda?  It's the clean, straight thing, isn't it?  Or
would the scandal hurt you?"
<P>
Amanda sat crouched together, with her eyes on Benham.
<P>
"Give us a divorce," said Easton, looking to her to confirm him.
<P>
Amanda shook her head.
<P>
"I don't want a divorce," she said.
<P>
"Then what do you want?" asked Benham with sudden asperity.
<P>
"I don't want a divorce," she repeated.  "Why do you, after a long
silence, come home like this, abruptly, with no notice?"
<P>
"It was the way it took me," said Benham, after a little interval.
<P>
"You have left me for long months."
<P>
"Yes.  I was angry.  And it was ridiculous to be angry.  I thought I
wanted to kill you, and now I see you I see that all I want to do is
to help you out of this miserable mess--and then get away from you.
You two would like to marry.  You ought to be married."
<P>
"I would die to make Amanda happy," said Easton.
<P>
"Your business, it seems to me, is to live to make her happy.  That
you may find more of a strain.  Less tragic and more tiresome.  I,
on the other hand, want neither to die nor live for her."  Amanda
moved sharply.  "It's extraordinary what amazing vapours a lonely
man may get into his head.  If you don't want a divorce then I
suppose things might go on as they are now."
<P>
"I hate things as they are now," said Easton.  "I hate this
falsehood and deception."
<P>
"You would hate the scandal just as much," said Amanda.
<P>
"I would not care what the scandal was unless it hurt you."
<P>
"It would be only a temporary inconvenience," said Benham.  "Every
one would sympathize with you. . . .  The whole thing is so
natural. . . .  People would be glad to forget very soon.  They
did with my mother."
<P>
"No," said Amanda, "it isn't so easy as that."
<P>
She seemed to come to a decision.
<P>
"Pip," she said.  "I want to talk to--HIM--alone."
<P>
Easton's brown eyes were filled with distress and perplexity.  "But
why?" he asked.
<P>
"I do," she said.
<P>
"But this is a thing for US."
<P>
"Pip, I want to talk to him alone.  There is something--something I
can't say before you. . . ."
<P>
Sir Philip rose slowly to his feet.
<P>
"Shall I wait outside?"
<P>
"No, Pip.  Go home.  Yes,--there are some things you must leave to
me."
<P>
She stood up too and turned so that she and Benham both faced the
younger man.  The strangest uneasiness mingled with his resolve to
be at any cost splendid.  He felt--and it was a most unexpected and
disconcerting feeling--that he was no longer confederated with
Amanda; that prior, more fundamental and greater associations
prevailed over his little new grip upon her mind and senses.  He
stared at husband and wife aghast in this realization.  Then his
resolute romanticism came to his help.  "I would trust you--" he
began.  "If you tell me to go--"
<P>
Amanda seemed to measure her hold upon him.
<P>
She laid her hand upon his arm.  "Go, my dear Pip," she said.  "Go."
<P>
He had a moment of hesitation, of anguish, and it seemed to Benham
as though he eked himself out with unreality, as though somewhen,
somewhere, he had seen something of the sort in a play and filled in
a gap that otherwise he could not have supplied.
<P>
Then the door had closed upon him, and Amanda, pale and darkly
dishevelled, faced her husband, silently and intensely.
<P>
"WELL?" said Benham.
<P>
She held out her arms to him.
<P>
"Why did you leave me, Cheetah?  Why did you leave me?"
<P>
<P>
<P>
28
<P>
<P>
Benham affected to ignore those proffered arms.  But they recalled
in a swift rush the animal anger that had brought him back to
England.  To remind him of desire now was to revive an anger
stronger than any desire.  He spoke seeking to hurt her.
<P>
"I am wondering now," he said, "why the devil I came back."
<P>
"You had to come back to me."
<P>
"I could have written just as well about these things."
<P>
"CHEETAH," she said softly, and came towards him slowly, stooping
forward and looking into his eyes, "you had to come back to see your
old Leopard.  Your wretched Leopard.  Who has rolled in the dirt.
And is still yours."
<P>
"Do you want a divorce?  How are we to fix things, Amanda?"
<P>
"Cheetah, I will tell you how we will fix things."
<P>
She dropped upon the step below him.  She laid her hands with a
deliberate softness upon him, she gave a toss so that her disordered
hair was a little more disordered, and brought her soft chin down to
touch his knees.  Her eyes implored him.
<P>
"Cheetah," she said.  "You are going to forgive."
<P>
He sat rigid, meeting her eyes.
<P>
"Amanda," he said at last, "you would be astonished if I kicked you
away from me and trampled over you to the door.  That is what I want
to do."
<P>
"Do it," she said, and the grip of her hands tightened.  "Cheetah,
dear!  I would love you to kill me."
<P>
"I don't want to kill you."
<P>
Her eyes dilated.  "Beat me."
<P>
"And I haven't the remotest intention of making love to you," he
said, and pushed her soft face and hands away from him as if he
would stand up.
<P>
She caught hold of him again.  "Stay with me," she said.
<P>
He made no effort to shake off her grip.  He looked at the dark
cloud of her hair that had ruled him so magically, and the memory of
old delights made him grip a great handful almost inadvertently as
he spoke.  "Dear Leopard," he said, "we humans are the most streaky
of conceivable things.  I thought I hated you.  I do.  I hate you
like poison.  And also I do not hate you at all."
<P>
Then abruptly he was standing over her.
<P>
She rose to her knees.
<P>
"Stay here, old Cheetah!" she said.  "This is your house.  I am your
wife."
<P>
He went towards the unfastened front door.
<P>
"Cheetah!" she cried with a note of despair.
<P>
He halted at the door.
<P>
"Amanda, I will come to-morrow.  I will come in the morning, in the
sober London daylight, and then we will settle things."
<P>
He stared at her, and to her amazement he smiled.  He spoke as one
who remarks upon a quite unexpected fact. . . .
<P>
"Never in my life, Amanda, have I seen a human being that I wanted
so little to kill."
<P>
<P>
<P>
29
<P>
<P>
White found a fragment that might have been written within a week of
those last encounters of Benham and Amanda.
<P>
"The thing that astonished me most in Amanda was the change in her
mental quality.
<P>
"With me in the old days she had always been a sincere person; she
had deceived me about facts, but she had never deceived me about
herself.  Her personal, stark frankness had been her essential
strength.  And it was gone.  I came back to find Amanda an
accomplished actress, a thing of poses and calculated effects.  She
was a surface, a sham, a Lorelei.  Beneath that surface I could not
discover anything individual at all.  Fear and a grasping quality,
such as God gave us all when he gave us hands; but the individual I
knew, the humorous wilful Spotless Leopard was gone.  Whither, I
cannot imagine.  An amazing disappearance.  Clean out of space and
time like a soul lost for ever.
<P>
"When I went to see her in the morning, she was made up for a scene,
she acted an intricate part, never for a moment was she there in
reality. . . .
<P>
"I have got a remarkable persuasion that she lost herself in this
way, by cheapening love, by making base love to a lover she
despised. . . .  There can be no inequality in love.  Give and take
must balance.  One must be one's natural self or the whole business
is an indecent trick, a vile use of life!  To use inferiors in love
one must needs talk down to them, interpret oneself in their
insufficient phrases, pretend, sentimentalize.  And it is clear that
unless oneself is to be lost, one must be content to leave alone all
those people that one can reach only by sentimentalizing.  But
Amanda--and yet somehow I love her for it still--could not leave any
one alone.  So she was always feverishly weaving nets of false
relationship.  Until her very self was forgotten.  So she will go on
until the end.  With Easton it had been necessary for her to key
herself to a simple exalted romanticism that was entirely insincere.
She had so accustomed herself to these poses that her innate
gestures were forgotten.  She could not recover them; she could not
even reinvent them.  Between us there were momentary gleams as
though presently we should be our frank former selves again.  They
were never more than momentary. . . ."
<P>
And that was all that this astonishing man had seen fit to tell of
his last parting from his wife.
<P>
Perhaps he did Amanda injustice.  Perhaps there was a stronger
thread of reality in her desire to recover him than he supposed.
Clearly he believed that under the circumstances Amanda would have
tried to recover anybody.
<P>
She had dressed for that morning's encounter in a very becoming and
intimate wrap of soft mauve and white silk, and she had washed and
dried her dark hair so that it was a vapour about her face.  She set
herself with a single mind to persuade herself and Benham that they
were inseparable lovers, and she would not be deflected by his grim
determination to discuss the conditions of their separation.  When
he asked her whether she wanted a divorce, she offered to throw over
Sir Philip and banish him for ever as lightly as a great lady might
sacrifice an objectionable poodle to her connubial peace.
<P>
Benham passed through perplexing phases, so that she herself began
to feel that her practice with Easton had spoilt her hands.  His
initial grimness she could understand, and partially its breakdown
into irritability.  But she was puzzled by his laughter.  For he
laughed abruptly.
<P>
"You know, Amanda, I came home in a mood of tremendous tragedy.  And
really,--you are a Lark."
<P>
And then overriding her altogether, he told her what he meant to do
about their future and the future of their little son.
<P>
"You don't want a divorce and a fuss.  Then I'll leave things.  I
perceive I've no intention of marrying any more.  But you'd better
do the straight thing.  People forget and forgive.  Especially when
there is no one about making a fuss against you.
<P>
"Perhaps, after all, there is something to be said for shirking it.
We'll both be able to get at the boy then.  You'll not hurt him, and
I shall want to see him.  It's better for the boy anyhow not to have
a divorce.
<P>
"I'll not stand in your way.  I'll get a little flat and I shan't
come too much to London, and when I do, you can get out of town.
You must be discreet about Easton, and if people say anything about
him, send them to me.  After all, this is our private affair.
<P>
"We'll go on about money matters as we have been going.  I trust to
you not to run me into overwhelming debts.  And, of course, if at
any time, you do want to marry--on account of children or anything--
if nobody knows of this conversation we can be divorced then. . . ."
<P>
Benham threw out these decisions in little dry sentences while
Amanda gathered her forces for her last appeal.
<P>
It was an unsuccessful appeal, and at the end she flung herself down
before him and clung to his knees.  He struggled ridiculously to get
himself clear, and when at last he succeeded she dropped prostrate
on the floor with her dishevelled hair about her.
<P>
She heard the door close behind him, and still she lay there, a dark
Guinevere, until with a start she heard a step upon the thick carpet
without.  He had come back.  The door reopened.  There was a slight
pause, and then she raised her face and met the blank stare of the
second housemaid.  There are moments, suspended fragments of time
rather than links in its succession, when the human eye is more
intelligible than any words.
<P>
The housemaid made a rapid apologetic noise and vanished with a
click of the door.
<P>
"DAMN!" said Amanda.
<P>
Then slowly she rose to her knees.
<P>
She meditated through vast moments.
<P>
"It's a cursed thing to be a woman," said Amanda.  She stood up.
She put her hand on the telephone in the corner and then she forgot
about it.  After another long interval of thought she spoke.
<P>
"Cheetah!" she said, "Old Cheetah! . . .
<P>
"I didn't THINK it of you. . . ."
<P>
Then presently with the even joyless movements of one who does a
reasonable business, with something indeed of the manner of one who
packs a trunk, she rang up Sir Philip Easton.
<P>
<P>
<P>
30
<P>
<P>
The head chambermaid on the first floor of the Westwood Hotel in
Danebury Street had a curious and perplexing glimpse of Benham's
private processes the morning after this affair.
<P>
Benham had taken Room 27 on the afternoon of his return to London.
She had seen him twice or three times, and he had struck her as a
coldly decorous person, tall, white-faced, slow speaking; the last
man to behave violently or surprise a head chambermaid in any way.
On the morning of his departure she was told by the first-floor
waiter that the occupant of Room 26 had complained of an uproar in
the night, and almost immediately she was summoned to see Benham.
<P>
He was standing facing the door and in a position which did a little
obscure the condition of the room behind him.  He was carefully
dressed, and his manner was more cold and decorous than ever.  But
one of his hands was tied up in a white bandage.
<P>
"I am going this morning," he said, "I am going down now to
breakfast.  I have had a few little accidents with some of the
things in the room and I have cut my hand.  I want you to tell the
manager and see that they are properly charged for on the
bill. . . .  Thank you.''
<P>
The head chambermaid was left to consider the accidents.
<P>
Benham's things were all packed up and the room had an air of having
been straightened up neatly and methodically after a destructive
cataclysm.  One or two items that the chambermaid might possibly
have overlooked in the normal course of things were carefully
exhibited.  For example, the sheet had been torn into half a dozen
strips and they were lying side by side on the bed.  The clock on
the mantelpiece had been knocked into the fireplace and then pounded
to pieces.  All the looking-glasses in the room were smashed,
apparently the electric lamp that stood on the night table by the
bedside had been wrenched off and flung or hammered about amidst the
other breakables.  And there was a considerable amount of blood
splashed about the room.  The head chambermaid felt unequal to the
perplexities of the spectacle and summoned her most convenient
friend, the head chambermaid on the third floor, to her aid.  The
first-floor waiter joined their deliberations and several housemaids
displayed a respectful interest in the maful to
Martindale House and the thing was rankling almost unendurably.  It
seemed to be a relief to him to show his son very fully the
essentially illogical position of his assailant.  He was entirely
inattentive to Benham's carefully made conversational opportunities.
He would be silent at times while Benham talked and then he would
break out suddenly with: "What seems to me so unreasonable, so
ridiculous, in the whole of that fellow's second argument--if one
can call it an argument--. . . .  A man who reasons as he does is
bound to get laughed at.  If people will only see it. . . ."
