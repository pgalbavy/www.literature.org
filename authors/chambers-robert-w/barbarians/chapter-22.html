<p>
MY <em>DJACK</em>:

</p>
<p>
Today has been very beautiful, made so for me by my thoughts of<br/>
you and by a warm September sun which makes for human happiness,<br/>
too.

</p>
<p>
I am wearing my ribbon of the Legion. Ah, my Djack, it belongs<br/>
more rightly to you, who would not let me go alone to Nivelle that<br/>
dreadful day. Why do they not give you the cross? They must be<br/>
very stupid in Paris.

</p>
<p>
All day my happy thoughts have been with you, my Djack. It all<br/>
seems a blessed dream that we love each other. And <em>I&mdash;</em>oh, how<br/>
could I have been so ignorant, so silly, not to know it sooner<br/>
than I did!

</p>
<p>
I don’t know; I thought it was friendship. And that was so<br/>
wonderful to me that I never dreamed any other miracle possible!

</p>
<p>
<em>Allons</em>, my Djack. Come and instruct me quickly, because my<br/>
desire for further knowledge is very ardent.

</p>
<p>
The news? <em>Cher ami</em>, there is little. Always the far thunder<br/>
beyond Nivelle in ruins; sometimes a battle-plane high in the<br/>
blue; a convoy of your beloved mules arriving from the coast;<br/>
nothing more exciting.

</p>
<p>
Monsieur Smeet and Monsieur Glenn inquire always concerning you.<br/>
They are brave and kind; their odd jests amuse me.

</p>
<p>
My father caught a tench in the Lesse this morning.

</p>
<p>
My gardener, Karl, collected many unpleasant creatures while<br/>
hoeing our potatoes. Poor lad, he seems unhealthy. I am glad I<br/>
could offer him employment.

</p>
<p>
My Djack, there could not possibly be any mistake about him, could<br/>
there? His papers are en règle. He is what he pretends, a Belgian<br/>
student from Ypres in distress and ill health, is he not?

</p>
<p>
But how can you answer me, you who lie there all alone in a<br/>
hospital at Nice? Also, I am ashamed of myself for doubting the<br/>
unfortunate young man. I am too happy to doubt anybody, perhaps.

</p>
<p>
And so good night, my Djack. Sleep sweetly, guarded by powerful<br/>
angels.

</p>
<p>
Thy devoted,<br/>
<em>MARYETTE</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>She had been writing in the deserted café. Now she took a candle
and went slowly upstairs. On the white plaster wall of her bedroom
was a Death’s Head moth.</p>

<p>The girl, startled for an instant, stood still; an unfeigned
shiver of displeasure passed over her. Not that the Death’s Head
was an unfamiliar or terrifying sight to her; in late summer she
usually saw one or two which had flown through some lighted window.</p>

<p>But it was the amorous history of this creature which the student
Karl had related that now repelled her. This night creature with
the skull on its neck, once scarcely noticed, had now become a
trifle repulsive.</p>

<p>She went nearer, lifting the lighted candle. The thing crouched
there with slanted wings. It was newly hatched, its sleek body
still wet with the humors of incubation&mdash;wet as a soaked mouse.
Its abdomen, too, seemed enormous, all swelled and distended with
unfertilized eggs. No, there could be no question concerning the
sex of the thing; this was a female, and her tumefied body was
almost bursting with eggs.</p>

<p>In startling design the yellow skull stood out; the ribs of the
skeleton. Two tiny, fiery eyes glimmered at the base of the antennæ&mdash;two
minute jewelled sparks of glowing, lambent fire. They seemed to
be watching her, maliciously askance.</p>

<p>The very horrid part of it was that, if touched, the creature
would cry out. The girl knew this, hesitated, looked at the open
window through which it must have crawled, and sat down on her
bed to consider the situation.</p>

<p>"After all," she said to herself resolutely. "God made it. It
is harmless. If God thought fit to paint one of his lesser creatures
like a skeleton, perhaps it was to remind us that life is brief
and that we should lose no time to live it nobly in His sight....
I think that perhaps explains it."</p>

<p>However, she did not undress.</p>

<p>"I am quite foolish to be afraid of this poor moth. I repeat
that I am foolish. <em>Allez</em>&mdash;I am <em>not</em> afraid. I
am no longer afraid. I &mdash;I admire this handiwork of God."</p>

<p>She sat looking at the creature, her hands lying clasped in her
lap.</p>

<p>"It’s a very odd thing," she said to herself, "that a lover can
find this creature even if he be miles and miles away.... Maybe
he’s on his way now&#11834;"</p>

<p>Instinctively she sprang up and closed her bedroom window.</p>

<p>"No," she said, looking severely at the motionless moth, "you
shall have no visitors in my room. You may remain here; I shall
not disturb you; and tomorrow you will go away of your own accord.
But I cannot permit you to receive company&#11834;"</p>

<p>A heavy fall on the floor above checked her. Breathless, listening,
she crept to her door.</p>

<p>"Karl!" she called.</p>

<p>Listening again, she could hear distant and vaguely dreadful
sounds from the gardener-student’s room above.</p>

<p>She was frightened but she went up. The youth had had a bad hemorrhage.
She sat beside him late into the night. After his breathing grew
quieter, sitting there in silence she could hear odd sounds, rustling,
squeaking sounds from the box of Death’s Head chrysalids on the
night table beside his bed.</p>

<p>The pupæ of the Death’s Head were making merry in anticipation
of the rapidly approaching change&mdash;the Great Adventure of their
lives&mdash;the coming metamorphosis.</p>

<p>The youth lay asleep now. As she extinguished the candle and
stole from the room, all the pupæ of the Death’s Head began to
squeak in the darkness.</p>

<hr>

</p>
</div>
<p>The student-gardener could do no more work for the present. He
lay propped up in bed, pasty, scarlet lipped, and he seemed bald
and lidless, so colourless were hair and eye-lashes.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you, Karl?" asked Maryette, coming in
for a moment as usual in the intervals of her many duties.</p>

<p>"The ink, if you would be so condescending&mdash;and a pen," he said,
watching her out of hollow, sallow eyes of watery blue.</p>

<p>She fetched both from the café.</p>

<p>She came again in another hour, knocking at his door, but he
said rather sharply that he wished to sleep.</p>

<p>Scarcely noticing the querulous tone, she departed. She had much
to do besides her duties in the belfry. Her father was an invalid
who required constant care; there was only one servant, an old
peasant woman who cooked. The Government required her father to
keep open the White Doe Tavern, and there was always a little
business from the scanty garrison of Sainte Lesse, always a few
meals to get, a few drinks to serve, and nobody now to do it except
herself.</p>

<p>Then, in the belfry she had duties other than playing, than practice.
Always at night the clock-drum was to be wound.</p>

<p>She had no assistant. The town maintained none, and her salary
as Mistress of the Bells of Sainte Lesse did not permit her to
engage anybody to help her.</p>

<p>So she oiled and wound all the machinery herself, adjusted and
cared for the clock, swept the keyboard clean, inspected and looked
after the wires leading to the tiers of bells overhead.</p>

<p>Then there was work to do in the garden&mdash;a few minutes snatched
between other duties. And when night arrived at last she was rather
tired&mdash;quite weary on this night in particular, having managed
to fulfill all the duties of the sick youth as well as her own.</p>

<p>The night was warm and fragrant. She sat in the dark at her open
window for a while, looking out into the north where, along the
horizon, heat lightning seemed to play. But it was only the reflected
flashes of the guns. When the wind was right, she could hear them.</p>

<p>She had even managed to write to her lover. Now, seated beside
the open window, she was thinking of him. A dreamy, happy lethargy
possessed her; she was on the first delicate verge of slumber,
so close to it that all earthly sounds were dying out in her ears.
Then, suddenly, she was awake, listening.</p>

<p>A window had been opened in the room overhead.</p>

<p>She went to the stars and called:</p>

<p>"Karl!"</p>

<p>"What?" came the impatient reply.</p>

<p>"Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"No. N-no, I thank you&mdash;" His voice became urbane with an apparent
effort. "Thank you for inquiring&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I heard your window open&mdash;" she said.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I am quite well. The air is mild and grateful....
I thank mademoiselle for her solicitude."</p>

<p>She returned to her room and lighted her candle. On the white
plaster wall sat the Death’s Head moth.</p>

<p>She had not been in her room all day. She was astonished that
the moth had not left.</p>

<p>"Shall I have to put you out?" she thought dubiously. "Really,
I can not keep my window closed for fear of visitors for you,
Madam Death! I certainly shall be obliged to put you out."</p>

<p>So she found a sheet of paper and a large glass tumbler. Over
the moth she placed the tumbler, then slipped the sheet of paper
under the glass between moth and wall.</p>

<p>The thing cried and cried, beating at the glass with wings as
powerful as a bird’s, and the girl, startled and slightly repelled,
placed the moth on her night table, imprisoned under the tumbler.</p>

<p>For a while it fluttered and flapped and cried out in its strange,
uncanny way, then settled on the sheet of paper, quivering its
wings, both eyes like living coals.</p>

<p>Seated on the bedside, Maryette looked at it, schooling herself
to think of it kindly as one of God’s creatures before she released
it at her open window.</p>

<p>And, as she sat there, something came whizzing into the room
through her window, circled around her at terrific speed with
a humming, whispering whirr, then dropped with a solid thud on
the night table beside the imprisoned female moth.</p>

<p>It was the first suitor arrived from outer darkness&mdash;a big, powerful
Death’s Head moth with eyes aglow, the yellow skull displayed
in startling contrast on his velvet-black body.</p>

<p>The girl watched him, fascinated. He scrambled over to the tumbler,
tested it with heavy antennæ; then, ardent and impatient, beat
against the glass with muscular wings that clattered in the silence.</p>

<p>But it was not the amorous fury of the creature striking the
tumbler with resounding wings, not the glowing eyes, the strong,
clawed feet, the Death’s Head staring from its funereal black
thorax that held the girl’s attention. It was something else;
something entirely different riveted her eyes on the creature.</p>

<p>For the cigar-shaped body, instead of bearing the naked ribs
of a skeleton, was snow white.</p>

<p>And now she began to understand. Somebody had already caught
the moth, had wrapped around its body a cylinder of white tissue
paper&mdash;tied it on with a fine, white silk thread.</p>

<p>The moth was very still now, exploring the interstices between
tumbler and table with heavy, pectinated antennæ.</p>

<p>Cautiously Maryette bent forward and dropped both hands on the
moth.</p>

<p>Instantly the creature cried out horribly; it was like a mouse
between her shrinking fingers; but she slipped the cylinder of
tissue paper from its abdomen and released it with a shiver; and
it darted and whizzed around the room, gyrating in whistling circles
around her head until, unnerved, she struck at it again and again
with empty hands, following, driving it toward the open window,
out of which it suddenly darted.</p>

<p>But now there was another Death’s Head in the room, a burly,
headlong, infatuated male which drove headlong at the tumbler
and clung to it, slipping, sliding, filling the room with a feathery
tattoo of wings.</p>

<p>It, also, had a snow-white body; and before she had seized the
squeaking thing and had slipped the tissue wrapper from its body,
another Death’s Head whirred through the window; then another,
then two; then others. The room swarmed; they were crawling all
over the tumbler, the table, the bed. The room was filled with
the soft, velvety roar of whirring wings beating on wall and ceiling
and against the tumbler where Madam Death sat imprisoned, quivering
her wings, her eyes two molten rubies, and the ghastly skull staring
from her back.</p>

<p>How Maryette ever brought herself to do it; how she did it at
last, she had no very clear idea. The touch of the slippery, mousy
bodies was fearsomely repugnant to her; the very sight of the
great, skull-bearing things began to sicken her physically. A
dreadful, almost impalpable floss from their handled wings and
bodies smeared her hands; the place vibrated with their tiny goblin
cries.</p>

<p>Somehow she managed to strip them of the tissue cylinders, drive
them from where they crawled on ceiling, wall and sill into whistling
flight. Amid a whirlwind of wings she fought them toward the open
window; whizzing, flitting, circling they sped in widening spirals
to escape her blows, where she stood half blinded in the vortex
of the ghostly maelstrom.</p>

<p>One by one they darted through the open window out into the night;
and when the last spectral streak of grey had sped into outer
darkness the girl slammed the windowpanes shut and leaned against
the sill enervated, exhausted, revolted.</p>

<p>The room was misty with the microscopic dust from the creatures’
wings; on her palms and fingers were black stains and stains of
livid orange; and across wall and ceiling streaks and smudges
of rusty colour.</p>

<p>She was still trembling when she washed the smears from her hands.
Her fingers were still unsteady as she smoothed out each tiny
sheet of tissue paper and laid it on her night table. Then, seated
on the bed’s edge beside the lighted candle, she began to read
the messages written in ink on these frail, translucent tissue
missives.</p>

<p>Every bit of tissue bore a message; the writing was microscopic,
the script German, the language Flemish. Slowly, with infinite
pains, the little bell-mistress of Sainte Lesse translated to
herself each message as she deciphered it.</p>

<p>She was trembling more than ever when she finished. Every trace
of colour had fled from her cheeks.</p>

<p>Then, as she sat there, struggling to keep her mind clear of
the horror of the thing, striving to understand what was to be
done, there came upon her window pane a sudden muffled drumming
sound, and her frightened gaze fell upon a Death’s Head moth outside,
its eyes like coals, its misty wings beating furiously for admittance.
And around its body was tied a cylinder of white tissue.</p>

<p>But the girl needed no more evidence. The wretched youth in the
room overhead had already sealed his own doom with any one of
these tissue cylinders. Better for him if the hemorrhage had slain
him. Now a firing squad must do that much for him.</p>

<p>Yet, even still, the girl hesitated, almost incredulous, trying
to comprehend the monstrous grotesquerie of the abominable plot.</p>

<p>Intuition pointed to the truth; logic proved it; somewhere in
the German trenches a comrade of this spy was awaiting these messages
with a caged Death’s Head female as the bait&mdash;a living loadstone
wearing the terrific emblems of death&mdash;an unfailing magnet to
draw the skull-bearing messengers for miles&mdash;had it not been that
a <em>nearer magnet deflected them in their flight!</em></p>

<p>That was it! That was what the miserable youth upstairs had not
counted on. Chance had ruined him; destiny had sent Madam Death
into the room below him to draw, with her macabre charms, every
ardent winged messenger which he liberated from his bedroom window.</p>

<p>The subtle effluvia permeating the night air for miles around
might have guided these messengers into the German trenches had
not a nearer and more imperious perfume annihilated it. Headlong,
amorous, impatient they had whirled toward the embraces of Madam
Death; the nearer and more powerful perfume had drawn the half-maddened,
half-drugged messengers. The spy in the room upstairs, like many
Germans, had reasoned wrongly on sound premises. His logic had
broken down, not his amazing scientific foundation. His theory
was correct; his application stupid.</p>

<p>And now this young man was about to die. Maryette understood
that. She comprehended that his death was necessary; that it was
the unavoidable sequence of what he had attempted to do. Trapped
rats must be drowned; vermin exterminated by easiest and quickest
methods; spies who betray one’s native land pass naturally the
same route.</p>

<p>But this thing, this grotesque, incredible, terrible attempt
to engraft treachery on one of nature’s most amazing laws&mdash;this
secret, cunning Teutonic reasoning, this scientific scoundrelism,
this criminal enterprise based on patient, plodding and German
efficiency, still bewildered the girl.</p>

<p>And yet she vaguely realized how science had been already prostituted
to Prussian malignancy and fury; she had heard of flame jets,
of tear-bombs, of bombs containing deadly germs; she herself had
beheld the poison gas rolling back into the trenches at Nivelle
under the town tower. Dimly she began to understand that the Hun,
in his cunning savagery, had tricked, betrayed and polluted civilization
itself into lending him her own secrets with which she was ultimately
to be destroyed.</p>

<p>The very process of human thinking had been imitated by these
monkeys of Europe&mdash;apes with the ferocity of hogs&mdash;and no souls,
none&mdash;nothing to lift them inside the pale where dwells the human
race.</p>

<p>There came a rapping on the café door. The girl rose wearily;
an immense weight seemed to crush her shoulders so that her knees
had become unsteady.</p>

<p>She opened the café door; it was Sticky Smith, come for his nightcap
before turning in.</p>

<p>"The man upstairs is a German spy," she said listlessly. "Had
you not better go over and get a gendarme?"</p>

<p>"Who’s a spy? That Dutch shrimp you had in your garden?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" demanded the muleteer with an oath.</p>

<p>She placed her lighted candle on the bar.</p>

<p>"Wait," she said. "Read these first&mdash;we must be quite certain
about what we do."</p>

<p>She laid the squares of tissue paper out on the bar.</p>

<p>"Do you read Flemish?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"No, ma’am&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Then I will translate into French for you. And first of all
I must tell you how I came to possess these little letters written
upon tissue. Please listen attentively."</p>

<p>He rested his palm on the butt of his dangling automatic.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said.</p>

<p>She told him the circumstances.</p>

<p>As she commenced to translate the tissue paper messages in a
low, tremulous voice, the sound of a door being closed and locked
in the room overhead silenced her.</p>

<p>The next instant she had stepped out to the stairs and called:</p>

<p>"Karl!"</p>

<p>There was no reply. Smith came out to the stair-well and listened.</p>

<p>"It is his custom," she whispered, "to lock his door before retiring.
That is what we heard."</p>

<p>"Call again."</p>

<p>"He can’t hear me. He is in bed."</p>

<p>"Call, all the same."</p>

<p>"Karl!" she cried out in an unsteady voice.</p>
