<p>After Sandy Chipmunk had dug his chamber underneath Farmer Green's
pasture, he liked the <u>inside</u> of his house quite well. But the looks of
the <u>outside</u> did not please him at all. He wanted a neat dooryard. And
how could he have that, with that yawning hole through which he had
pushed earth and stones, which still littered the grass a little
distance away?
</p>
<p>Luckily, Sandy knew exactly what to do. So he set to work to close the
big work-hole. It was no easy task--as you can believe. But at last he
managed to pack the hole full of dirt.
</p><p>Then he had no door at all. And there he was in the dark, inside the
hall that led to his chamber and storeroom. But that did not worry Sandy.
You see, he knew just what he was about. And before long he had dug a new
doorway--a small, neat, round hole, which you would probably have walked
right past, without noticing it, it was so hard to see in the grass that
grew thickly about it.
</p><p>You might think that at last Sandy's house was finished. But he was not
satisfied with it until he had made still another doorway, in the same
fashion. He knew that it was safer to have an extra door through which he
could slip out when some enemy was entering by the other one. Then Sandy
Chipmunk's house was finished. And he was greatly pleased with it.
</p><p>But his work was not yet done. He had to furnish his chamber. So he began
to hunt about for dry leaves, to make him a bed. These he stuffed into
his cheek-pouches and carried into his house. But he didn't march proudly
up to one of his two doors. Oh, no! He reached it by careful leaps and
bounds. And when he left home again he was particular to go in the same
manner in which he had come.
</p><p>It made no difference which of his doors Sandy used. He always came and
went like that, because he didn't want to wear a path to either of his
two doors or tramp down the grass around them. If he had been so careless
as to let people notice where he lived he would have been almost sure to
have enemies prowling about his house. And if a weasel had happened to
see one of Sandy's neat doorways he would have pushed right in, in the
hope of finding Sandy inside his house.
</p><p>In that case the weasel would probably have pushed out again, with Sandy
inside <u>him</u>. So you can understand that Sandy Chipmunk had the best of
reasons for being careful.
</p><p>After he had made a soft, warm bed for himself, Sandy set to work to
gather nuts and grain, to store in his house and eat during the winter.
He was particular to choose only well cured (or dried) food, for he knew
that that was the only sort that would keep through the long winter, down
in his underground storeroom.
</p><p>He gathered other food, too, besides nuts and grain. Near Farmer Green's
house he found some plump sunflower seeds, which he added to his store.
Then there were wild-cherry pits, too, which the birds had dropped upon
the ground. All these, and many other kinds of food, found their way into
Sandy Chipmunk's home.
</p><p>Much as he liked such things to eat--and especially sunflower seeds--he
never ate a single nut or grain or seed while he gathered them for his
winter's food. And when you stop to remember that he had to carry
everything home in his <u>mouth</u>, you can see that Sandy Chipmunk had what
is called self-control.
</p><p>His mother had always told him that he couldn't get through a winter
without that. And so, when Sandy brought her to see his new home, after
it was all finished, and his bed was neatly made, and his storeroom full
of food, Mrs. Chipmunk was delighted.
</p><p>"I'm glad to see--" she said--"I'm glad to see that all my talking has
done some good."
