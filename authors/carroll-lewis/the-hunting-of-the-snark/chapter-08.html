               They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br />
               They pursued it with forks and hope;<br />
               They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br />
               They charmed it with smiles and soap.
          <P>
               They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,<br />
               And the Beaver, excited at last,<br />
               Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,<br />
               For the daylight was nearly past.
          <P>
               "There is Thingumbob shouting!" the Bellman said,<br />
               "He is shouting like mad, only hark!<br />
               He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,<br />
               He has certainly found a Snark!"
          <P>
               They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed<br />
               "He was always a desperate wag!"<br />
               They beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed--<br />
               On the top of a neighboring crag.
          <P>
               Erect and sublime, for one moment of time.<br />
               In the next, that wild figure they saw<br />
               (As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,<br />
               While they waited and listened in awe.
          <P>
               "It's a Snark!" was the sound that first came to their ears,<br />
               And seemed almost too good to be true.<br />
               Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:<br />
               Then the ominous words "It's a Boo-"
          <P>
               Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air<br />
               A weary and wandering sigh<br />
               Then sounded like "-jum!" but the others declare<br />
               It was only a breeze that went by.
          <P>
               They hunted till darkness came on, but they found<br />
               Not a button, or feather, or mark,<br />
               By which they could tell that they stood on the ground<br />
               Where the Baker had met with the Snark.
          <P>
               In the midst of the word he was trying to say,<br />
               In the midst of his laughter and glee,<br />
               He had softly and suddenly vanished away---<br />
               For the Snark <i>was</i> a Boojum, you see.
