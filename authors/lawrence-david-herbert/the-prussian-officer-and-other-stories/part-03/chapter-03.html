<p>It happened when Miss Mary was twenty-three years old, that Mr
Lindley was very ill.  The family was exceedingly poor at the time,
such a lot of money was needed, so little was forthcoming.  Neither
Miss Mary nor Miss Louisa had suitors.  What chance had they?  They
met no eligible young men in Aldecross.  And what they earned was a
mere drop in a void.  The girls' hearts were chilled and hardened
with fear of this perpetual, cold penury, this narrow struggle,
this horrible nothingness of their lives.</p>

<p>A clergyman had to be found for the church work.  It so happened
the son of an old friend of Mr Lindley's was waiting three months
before taking up his duties.  He would come and officiate, for
nothing.  The young clergyman was keenly expected.  He was not more
than twenty-seven, a Master of Arts of Oxford, had written his
thesis on Roman Law.  He came of an old Cambridgeshire family, had
some private means, was going to take a church in Northamptonshire
with a good stipend, and was not married.  Mrs Lindley incurred new
debts, and scarcely regretted her husband's illness.</p>

<p>But when Mr Massy came, there was a shock of disappointment in the
house.  They had expected a young man with a pipe and a deep voice,
but with better manners than Sidney, the eldest of the Lindleys.
There arrived instead a small, ch&eacute;tif man, scarcely larger than a
boy of twelve, spectacled, timid in the extreme, without a word to
utter at first; yet with a certain inhuman self-sureness.</p>

<p>&quot;What a little abortion!&quot; was Mrs Lindley's exclamation to herself
on first seeing him, in his buttoned-up clerical coat.  And for the
first time for many days, she was profoundly thankful to God that
all her children were decent specimens.</p>

<p>He had not normal powers of perception.  They soon saw that he
lacked the full range of human feelings, but had rather a strong,
philosophical mind, from which he lived.  His body was almost
unthinkable, in intellect he was something definite.  The
conversation at once took a balanced, abstract tone when he
participated.  There was no spontaneous exclamation, no violent
assertion or expression of personal conviction, but all cold,
reasonable assertion.  This was very hard on Mrs Lindley.  The
little man would look at her, after one of her pronouncements, and
then give, in his thin voice, his own calculated version, so that
she felt as if she were tumbling into thin air through a hole in
the flimsy floor on which their conversation stood.  It was she who
felt a fool.  Soon she was reduced to a hardy silence.</p>

<p>Still, at the back of her mind, she remembered that he was an
unattached gentleman, who would shortly have an income altogether
of six or seven hundred a year.  What did the man matter, if there
were pecuniary ease!  The man was a trifle thrown in.  After
twenty-two years her sentimentality was ground away, and only the
millstone of poverty mattered to her.  So she supported the little
man as a representative of a decent income.</p>

<p>His most irritating habit was that of a sneering little giggle, all
on his own, which came when he perceived or related some illogical
absurdity on the part of another person.  It was the only form of
humour he had.  Stupidity in thinking seemed to him exquisitely
funny.  But any novel was unintelligibly meaningless and dull, and
to an Irish sort of humour he listened curiously, examining it like
mathematics, or else simply not hearing.  In normal human
relationship he was not there.  Quite unable to take part in simple
everyday talk, he padded silently round the house, or sat in the
dining-room looking nervously from side to side, always apart in a
cold, rarefied little world of his own.  Sometimes he made an
ironic remark, that did not seem humanly relevant, or he gave his
little laugh, like a sneer.  He had to defend himself and his own
insufficiency.  And he answered questions grudgingly, with a yes or
no, because he did not see their import and was nervous.  It seemed
to Miss Louisa he scarcely distinguished one person from another,
but that he liked to be near her, or to Miss Mary, for some sort of
contact which stimulated him unknown.</p>

<p>Apart from all this, he was the most admirable workman.  He was
unremittingly shy, but perfect in his sense of duty: as far as he
could conceive Christianity, he was a perfect Christian.  Nothing
that he realized he could do for anyone did he leave undone,
although he was so incapable of coming into contact with another
being, that he could not proffer help.  Now he attended assiduously
to the sick man, investigated all the affairs of the parish or the
church which Mr Lindley had in control, straightened out accounts,
made lists of the sick and needy, padded round with help and to see
what he could do.  He heard of Mrs Lindley's anxiety about her
sons, and began to investigate means of sending them to Cambridge.
His kindness almost frightened Miss Mary.  She honoured it so, and
yet she shrank from it.  For, in it all Mr Massy seemed to have no
sense of any person, any human being whom he was helping: he only
realized a kind of mathematical working out, solving of given
situations, a calculated well-doing.  And it was as if he had
accepted the Christian tenets as axioms.  His religion consisted in
what his scrupulous, abstract mind approved of.</p>

<p>Seeing his acts, Miss Mary must respect and honour him.  In
consequence she must serve him.  To this she had to force herself,
shuddering and yet desirous, but he did not perceive it.  She
accompanied him on his visiting in the parish, and whilst she was
cold with admiration for him, often she was touched with pity for
the little padding figure with bent shoulders, buttoned up to the
chin in his overcoat.  She was a handsome, calm girl, tall, with a
beautiful repose.  Her clothes were poor, and she wore a black silk
scarf, having no furs.  But she was a lady.  As the people saw her
walking down Aldecross beside Mr Massy, they said:</p>

<p>&quot;My word, Miss Mary's got a catch.  Did ever you see such a sickly
little shrimp!&quot;</p>

<p>She knew they were talking so, and it made her heart grow hot
against them, and she drew herself as it were protectively towards
the little man beside her.  At any rate, she could see and give
honour to his genuine goodness.</p>

<p>He could not walk fast, or far.</p>

<p>&quot;You have not been well?&quot; she asked, in her dignified way.</p>

<p>&quot;I have an internal trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>He was not aware of her slight shudder.  There was silence, whilst
she bowed to recover her composure, to resume her gentle manner
towards him.</p>

<p>He was fond of Miss Mary.  She had made it a rule of hospitality
that he should always be escorted by herself or by her sister on
his visits in the parish, which were not many.  But some mornings
she was engaged.  Then Miss Louisa took her place.  It was no good
Miss Louisa's trying to adopt to Mr Massy an attitude of queenly
service.  She was unable to regard him save with aversion.  When
she saw him from behind, thin and bent-shouldered, looking like a
sickly lad of thirteen, she disliked him exceedingly, and felt a
desire to put him out of existence.  And yet a deeper justice in
Mary made Louisa humble before her sister.</p>

<p>They were going to see Mr Durant, who was paralysed and not
expected to live.  Miss Louisa was crudely ashamed at being
admitted to the cottage in company with the little clergyman.</p>

<p>Mrs Durant was, however, much quieter in the face of her real
trouble.</p>

<p>&quot;How is Mr Durant?&quot; asked Louisa.</p>

<p>&quot;He is no different - and we don't expect him to be,&quot; was the reply.
The little clergyman stood looking on.</p>

<p>They went upstairs.  The three stood for some time looking at the
bed, at the grey head of the old man on the pillow, the grey beard
over the sheet.  Miss Louisa was shocked and afraid.</p>

<p>&quot;It is so dreadful,&quot; she said, with a shudder.</p>

<p>&quot;It is how I always thought it would be,&quot; replied Mrs Durant.</p>

<p>Then Miss Louisa was afraid of her.  The two women were uneasy,
waiting for Mr Massy to say something.  He stood, small and bent,
too nervous to speak.</p>

<p>&quot;Has he any understanding?&quot; he asked at length.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; said Mrs Durant.  &quot;Can you hear, John?&quot; she asked loudly.
The dull blue eye of the inert man looked at her feebly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, he understands,&quot; said Mrs Durant to Mr Massy.  Except for the
dull look in his eyes, the sick man lay as if dead.  The three
stood in silence.  Miss Louisa was obstinate but heavy-hearted
under the load of unlivingness.  It was Mr Massy who kept her there
in discipline.  His non-human will dominated them all.</p>

<p>Then they heard a sound below, a man's footsteps, and a man's voice
called subduedly:</p>

<p>&quot;Are you upstairs, mother?&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs Durant started and moved to the door.  But already a quick,
firm step was running up the stairs.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm a bit early, mother,&quot; a troubled voice said, and on the
landing they saw the form of the sailor.  His mother came and clung
to him.  She was suddenly aware that she needed something to hold
on to.  He put his arms round her, and bent over her, kissing her.</p>

<p>&quot;He's not gone, mother?&quot; he asked anxiously, struggling to control
his voice.</p>

<p>Miss Louisa looked away from the mother and son who stood together
in the gloom on the landing.  She could not bear it that she and Mr
Massy should be there.  The latter stood nervously, as if ill at
ease before the emotion that was running.  He was a witness,
nervous, unwilling, but dispassionate.  To Miss Louisa's hot heart
it seemed all, all wrong that they should be there.</p>

<p>Mrs Durant entered the bedroom, her face wet.</p>

<p>&quot;There's Miss Louisa and the vicar,&quot; she said, out of voice and
quavering.</p>

<p>Her son, red-faced and slender, drew himself up to salute.  But
Miss Louisa held out her hand.  Then she saw his hazel eyes
recognize her for a moment, and his small white teeth showed in a
glimpse of the greeting she used to love.  She was covered with
confusion.  He went round to the bed; his boots clicked on the
plaster floor, he bowed his head with dignity.</p>

<p>&quot;How are you, dad?&quot; he said, laying his hand on the sheet,
faltering.  But the old man stared fixedly and unseeing.  The son
stood perfectly still for a few minutes, then slowly recoiled.
Miss Louisa saw the fine outline of his breast, under the sailor's
blue blouse, as his chest began to heave.</p>

<p>&quot;He doesn't know me,&quot; he said, turning to his mother.  He gradually
went white.</p>

<p>&quot;No, my boy!&quot; cried the mother, pitiful, lifting her face.  And
suddenly she put her face against his shoulder, he was stooping
down to her, holding her against him, and she cried aloud for a
moment or two.  Miss Louisa saw his sides heaving, and heard the
sharp hiss of his breath.  She turned away, tears streaming down
her face.  The father lay inert upon the white bed, Mr Massy looked
queer and obliterated, so little now that the sailor with his
sunburned skin was in the room.  He stood waiting.  Miss Louisa
wanted to die, she wanted to have done.  She dared not turn round
again to look.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I offer a prayer?&quot; came the frail voice of the clergyman,
and all kneeled down.</p>

<p>Miss Louisa was frightened of the inert man upon the bed.  Then she
felt a flash of fear of Mr Massy, hearing his thin, detached voice.
And then, calmed, she looked up.  On the far side of the bed were
the heads of the mother and son, the one in the black lace cap,
with the small white nape of the neck beneath, the other, with
brown, sun-scorched hair too close and wiry to allow of a parting,
and neck tanned firm, bowed as if unwillingly.  The great grey
beard of the old man did not move, the prayer continued.  Mr Massy
prayed with a pure lucidity, that they all might conform to the
higher Will.  He was like something that dominated the bowed heads,
something dispassionate that governed them inexorably.  Miss Louisa
was afraid of him.  And she was bound, during the course of the
prayer, to have a little reverence for him.  It was like a
foretaste of inexorable, cold death, a taste of pure justice.</p>

<p>That evening she talked to Mary of the visit.  Her heart, her veins
were possessed by the thought of Alfred Durant as he held his
mother in his arms; then the break in his voice, as she remembered
it again and again, was like a flame through her; and she wanted to
see his face more distinctly in her mind, ruddy with the sun, and
his golden-brown eyes, kind and careless, strained now with a
natural fear, the fine nose tanned hard by the sun, the mouth that
could not help smiling at her.  And it went through her with pride,
to think of his figure, a straight, fine jet of life.</p>

<p>&quot;He is a handsome lad,&quot; said she to Miss Mary, as if he had not
been a year older than herself.  Underneath was the deeper dread,
almost hatred, of the inhuman being of Mr Massy.  She felt she must
protect herself and Alfred from him.</p>

<p>&quot;When I felt Mr Massy there,&quot; she said, &quot;I almost hated him.  What
right had he to be there!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Surely he has all right,&quot; said Miss Mary after a pause.  &quot;He is
REALLY a Christian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He seems to me nearly an imbecile,&quot; said Miss Louisa.</p>

<p>Miss Mary, quiet and beautiful, was silent for a moment:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; she said.  &quot;Not IMBECILE - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well then - he reminds me of a six months' child - or a five months'
child - as if he didn't have time to get developed enough before he
was born.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miss Mary, slowly.  &quot;There is something lacking.  But
there is something wonderful in him: and he is really GOOD - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miss Louisa, &quot;it doesn't seem right that he should be.
What right has THAT to be called goodness!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it IS goodness,&quot; persisted Mary.  Then she added, with a
laugh:  &quot;And come, you wouldn't deny that as well.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a doggedness in her voice.  She went about very quietly.
In her soul, she knew what was going to happen.  She knew that Mr
Massy was stronger than she, and that she must submit to what he
was.  Her physical self was prouder, stronger than he, her physical
self disliked and despised him.  But she was in the grip of his
moral, mental being.  And she felt the days allotted out to her.
And her family watched.</p>
