<p>On the seventeenth, the day I was trysted with the Writer, I
had much rebellion against fate. The thought of him waiting in
the <em>King’s Arms</em>, and of what he would think, and what
he would say when next we met, tormented and oppressed me. The
truth was unbelievable, so much I had to grant, and it seemed
cruel hard I should be posted as a liar and a coward, and have
never consciously omitted what it was possible that I should do.
I repeated this form of words with a kind of bitter relish, and
re-examined in that light the steps of my behaviour. It seemed
I had behaved to James Stewart as a brother might; all the past
was a picture that I could be proud of, and there was only the
present to consider. I could not swim the sea, nor yet fly in
the air, but there was always Andie. I had done him a service,
he liked me; I had a lever there to work on; if it were just for
decency, I must try once more with Andie.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon; there was no sound in all the Bass but
the lap and bubble of a very quiet sea; and my four companions
were all crept apart, the three Macgregors higher on the rock,
and Andie with his Bible to a sunny place among the ruins; there
I found him in deep sleep, and, as soon as he was awake, appealed
to him with some fervour of manner and a good show of argument.</p>

<p>"If I thoucht it was to do guid to ye, Shaws!" said he, staring
at me over his spectacles.</p>

<p>"It’s to save another," said I, "and to redeem my word. What
would be more good than that? Do ye no mind the scripture, Andie?
And you with the Book upon your lap! <em>What shall it profit
a man if he gain the whole world</em>?"</p>

<p>"Ay," said he, "that’s grand for you. But where do I come in!
I have my word to redeem the same’s yoursel’. And what are ye
asking me to do, but just to sell it ye for siller?"</p>

<p>"Andie! have I named the name of siller?" cried I.</p>

<p>"Ou, the name’s naething", said he; "the thing is there, whatever.
It just comes to this; if I am to service ye the way that you
propose, I’ll lose my lifelihood. Then it’s clear ye’ll have to
make it up to me, and a pickle mair, for your ain credit like.
And what’s that but just a bribe? And if even I was certain of
the bribe! But by a’ that I can learn, it’s far frae that; and
if <em>you</em> were to hang, where would <em>I</em> be? Na: the
thing’s no possible. And just awa’ wi’ ye like a bonny lad! and
let Andie read his chapter."</p>

<p>I remember I was at bottom a good deal gratified with this result;
and the next humour I fell into was one (I had near said) of gratitude
to Prestongrange, who had saved me, in this violent, illegal manner,
out of the midst of my dangers, temptations, and perplexities.
But this was both too flimsy and too cowardly to last me long,
and the remembrance of James began to succeed to the possession
of my spirits. The 21st, the day set for the trial, I passed in
such misery of mind as I can scarce recall to have endured, save
perhaps upon Isle Earraid only. Much of the time I lay on a brae-side
betwixt sleep and waking, my body motionless, my mind full of
violent thoughts. Sometimes I slept indeed; but the court-house
of Inverary and the prisoner glancing on all sides to find his
missing witness, followed me in slumber; and I would wake again
with a start to darkness of spirit and distress of body. I thought
Andie seemed to observe me, but I paid him little heed. Verily,
my bread was bitter to me, and my days a burthen.</p>

<p>Early the next morning (Friday, 22nd) a boat came with provisions,
and Andie placed a packet in my hand. The cover was without address
but sealed with a Government seal. It enclosed two notes. "Mr.
Balfour can now see for himself it is too late to meddle. His
conduct will be observed and his discretion rewarded." So ran
the first, which seemed to be laboriously writ with the left hand.
There was certainly nothing in these expressions to compromise
the writer, even if that person could be found; the seal, which
formidably served instead of signature, was affixed to a separate
sheet on which there was no scratch of writing; and I had to confess
that (so far) my adversaries knew what they were doing, and to
digest as well as I was able the threat that peeped under the
promise.</p>

<p>But the second enclosure was by far the more surprising. It was
in a lady’s hand of writ. "<em>Maister Dauvit Balfour is informed
a friend was speiring for him and her eyes were of the grey</em>,"
it ran—and seemed so extraordinary a piece to come to my hands
at such a moment and under cover of a Government seal, that I
stood stupid. Catriona’s grey eyes shone in my remembrance. I
thought, with a bound of pleasure, she must be the friend. But
who should the writer be, to have her billet thus enclosed with
Prestongrange’s? And of all wonders, why was it thought needful
to give me this pleasing but most inconsequent intelligence upon
the Bass? For the writer, I could hit upon none possible except
Miss Grant. Her family, I remembered, had remarked on Catriona’s
eyes and even named her for their colour; and she herself had
been much in the habit to address me with a broad pronunciation,
by way of a sniff, I supposed, at my rusticity. No doubt, besides,
but she lived in the same house as this letter came from. So there
remained but one step to be accounted for; and that was how Prestongrange
should have permitted her at all in an affair so secret, or let
her daft-like billet go in the same cover with his own. But even
here I had a glimmering. For, first of all, there was something
rather alarming about the young lady, and papa might be more under
her domination than I knew. And, second, there was the man’s continual
policy to be remembered, how his conduct had been continually
mingled with caresses, and he had scarce ever, in the midst of
so much contention, laid aside a mask of friendship. He must conceive
that my imprisonment had incensed me. Perhaps this little jesting,
friendly message was intended to disarm my rancour?</p>

<p>I will be honest—and I think it did. I felt a sudden warmth towards
that beautiful Miss Grant, that she should stoop to so much interest
in my affairs. The summoning up of Catriona moved me of itself
to milder and more cowardly counsels. If the Advocate knew of
her and our acquaintance—if I should please him by some of that
"discretion" at which his letter pointed—to what might not this
lead! <em>In vain is the net prepared in the sight of any fowl</em>,
the Scripture says. Well, fowls must be wiser than folk! For I
thought I perceived the policy, and yet fell in with it.</p>

<p>I was in this frame, my heart beating, the grey eyes plain before
me like two stars, when Andie broke in upon my musing.</p>

<p>"I see ye has gotten guid news," said he.</p>

<p>I found him looking curiously in my face; with that there came
before me like a vision of James Stewart and the court of Inverary;
and my mind turned at once like a door upon its hinges. Trials,
I reflected, sometimes draw out longer than is looked for. Even
if I came to Inverary just too late, something might yet be attempted
in the interests of James—and in those of my own character, the
best would be accomplished. In a moment, it seemed without thought,
I had a plan devised.</p>

<p>"Andie," said I, "is it still to be to-morrow?"</p>

<p>He told me nothing was changed.</p>

<p>"Was anything said about the hour?" I asked.</p>

<p>He told me it was to be two o’clock afternoon.</p>

<p>"And about the place?" I pursued.</p>

<p>"Whatten place?" says Andie.</p>

<p>"The place I am to be landed at?" said I.</p>

<p>He owned there was nothing as to that.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," I said, "this shall be mine to arrange. The
wind is in the east, my road lies westward: keep your boat, I
hire it; let us work up the Forth all day; and land me at two
o’clock to-morrow at the westmost we’ll can have reached."</p>

<p>"Ye daft callant!" he cried; "ye would try for Inverary after
a’!"</p>

<p>"Just that, Andie," says I.</p>

<p>"Weel, ye’re ill to beat!" says he. "And I was a kind o’ sorry
for ye a’ day yesterday," he added. "Ye see, I was never entirely
sure till then, which way of it ye really wantit."</p>

<p>Here was a spur to a lame horse!</p>

<p>"A word in your ear, Andie," said I. "This plan of mine has another
advantage yet. We can leave these Hielandman behind us on the
rock, and one of your boats from the Castleton can bring them
off to-morrow. Yon Neil has a queer eye when he regards you; maybe,
if I was once out of the gate there might be knives again; these
red-shanks are unco grudgeful. And if there should come to be
any question, here is your excuse. Our lives were in danger by
these savages; being answerable for my safety, you chose the part
to bring me from their neighbourhood and detain me the rest of
the time on board your boat: and do you know, Andie?" says I,
with a smile, "I think it was very wisely chosen."</p>

<p>"The truth is I have nae goo for Neil," says Andie, "nor he for
me, I’m thinking; and I would like ill to come to my hands wi’
the man. Tam Anster will make a better hand of it with the cattle
onyway." (For this man, Anster, came from Fife, where the Gaelic
is still spoken.) "Ay, ay!" says Andie, "Tam’ll can deal with
them the best. And troth! the mair I think of it, the less I see
we would be required. The place—ay, feggs! they had forgot the
place. Eh, Shaws, ye’re a lang-heided chield when ye like! Forby
that I’m awing ye my life," he added, with more solemnity, and
offered me his hand upon the bargain.</p>

<p>Whereupon, with scarce more words, we stepped suddenly on board
the boat, cast off, and set the lug. The Gregara were then busy
upon breakfast, for the cookery was their usual part; but, one
of them stepping to the battlements, our flight was observed before
we were twenty fathoms from the rock; and the three of them ran
about the ruins and the landing-shelf, for all the world like
ants about a broken nest, hailing and crying on us to return.
We were still in both the lee and the shadow of the rock, which
last lay broad upon the waters, but presently came forth in almost
the same moment into the wind and sunshine; the sail filled, the
boat heeled to the gunwale, and we swept immediately beyond sound
of the men’s voices. To what terrors they endured upon the rock,
where they were now deserted without the countenance of any civilised
person or so much as the protection of a Bible, no limit can be
set; nor had they any brandy left to be their consolation, for
even in the haste and secrecy of our departure Andie had managed
to remove it.</p>

<p>It was our first care to set Anster ashore in a cove by the Glenteithy
Rocks, so that the deliverance of our maroons might be duly seen
to the next day. Thence we kept away up Firth. The breeze, which
was then so spirited, swiftly declined, but never wholly failed
us. All day we kept moving, though often not much more; and it
was after dark ere we were up with the Queensferry. To keep the
letter of Andie’s engagement (or what was left of it) I must remain
on board, but I thought no harm to communicate with the shore
in writing. On Prestongrange’s cover, where the Government seal
must have a good deal surprised my correspondent, I writ, by the
boat’s lantern, a few necessary words, aboard and Andie carried
them to Rankeillor. In about an hour he came again, with a purse
of money and the assurance that a good horse should be standing
saddled for me by two to-morrow at Clackmannan Pool. This done,
and the boat riding by her stone anchor, we lay down to sleep
under the sail.</p>

<p>We were in the Pool the next day long ere two; and there was
nothing left for me but to sit and wait. I felt little alacrity
upon my errand. I would have been glad of any passable excuse
to lay it down; but none being to be found, my uneasiness was
no less great than if I had been running to some desired pleasure.
By shortly after one the horse was at the waterside, and I could
see a man walking it to and fro till I should land, which vastly
swelled my impatience. Andie ran the moment of my liberation very
fine, showing himself a man of his bare word, but scarce serving
his employers with a heaped measure; and by about fifty seconds
after two I was in the saddle and on the full stretch for Stirling.
In a little more than an hour I had passed that town, and was
already mounting Alan Water side, when the weather broke in a
small tempest. The rain blinded me, the wind had nearly beat me
from the saddle, and the first darkness of the night surprised
me in a wilderness still some way east of Balwhidder, not very
sure of my direction and mounted on a horse that began already
to be weary.</p>

<p>In the press of my hurry, and to be spared the delay and annoyance
of a guide, I had followed (so far as it was possible for any
horseman) the line of my journey with Alan. This I did with open
eyes, foreseeing a great risk in it, which the tempest had now
brought to a reality. The last that I knew of where I was, I think
it must have been about Uam Var; the hour perhaps six at night.
I must still think it great good fortune that I got about eleven
to my destination, the house of Duncan Dhu. Where I had wandered
in the interval perhaps the horse could tell. I know we were twice
down, and once over the saddle and for a moment carried away in
a roaring burn. Steed and rider were bemired up to the eyes.</p>

<p>From Duncan I had news of the trial. It was followed in all these
Highland regions with religious interest; news of it spread from
Inverary as swift as men could travel; and I was rejoiced to learn
that, up to a late hour that Saturday it was not yet concluded;
and all men began to suppose it must spread over the Monday. Under
the spur of this intelligence I would not sit to eat; but, Duncan
having agreed to be my guide, took the road again on foot, with
the piece in my hand and munching as I went. Duncan brought with
him a flask of usquebaugh and a hand-lantern; which last enlightened
us just so long as we could find houses where to rekindle it,
for the thing leaked outrageously and blew out with every gust.
The more part of the night we walked blindfold among sheets of
rain, and day found us aimless on the mountains. Hard by we struck
a hut on a burn-side, where we got bite and a direction; and,
a little before the end of the sermon, came to the kirk doors
of Inverary.</p>

<p>The rain had somewhat washed the upper parts of me, but I was
still bogged as high as to the knees; I streamed water; I was
so weary I could hardly limp, and my face was like a ghost’s.
I stood certainly more in need of a change of raiment and a bed
to lie on, than of all the benefits in Christianity. For all which
(being persuaded the chief point for me was to make myself immediately
public) I set the door of the church with the dirty Duncan at
my tails, and finding a vacant place sat down.</p>

<p>"Thirteently, my brethren, and in parenthesis, the law itself
must be regarded as a means of grace," the minister was saying,
in the voice of one delighting to pursue an argument.</p>

<p>The sermon was in English on account of the assize. The judges
were present with their armed attendants, the halberts glittered
in a corner by the door, and the seats were thronged beyond custom
with the array of lawyers. The text was in Romans 5th and 13th—the
minister a skilled hand; and the whole of that able churchful—from
Argyle, and my Lords Elchies and Kilkerran, down to the halbertmen
that came in their attendance—was sunk with gathered brows in
a profound critical attention. The minister himself and a sprinkling
of those about the door observed our entrance at the moment and
immediately forgot the same; the rest either did not hear or would
not hear or would not be heard; and I sat amongst my friends and
enemies unremarked.</p>

<p>The first that I singled out was Prestongrange. He sat well forward,
like an eager horseman in the saddle, his lips moving with relish,
his eyes glued on the minister; the doctrine was clearly to his
mind. Charles Stewart, on the other hand, was half asleep, and
looked harassed and pale. As for Simon Fraser, he appeared like
a blot, and almost a scandal, in the midst of that attentive congregation,
digging his hands in his pockets, shifting his legs, clearing
his throat, and rolling up his bald eyebrows and shooting out
his eyes to right and left, now with a yawn, now with a secret
smile. At times, too, he would take the Bible in front of him,
run it through, seem to read a bit, run it through again, and
stop and yawn prodigiously: the whole as if for exercise.</p>

<p>In the course of this restlessness his eye alighted on myself.
He sat a second stupefied, then tore a half-leaf out of the Bible,
scrawled upon it with a pencil, and passed it with a whispered
word to his next neighbour. The note came to Prestongrange, who
gave me but the one look; thence it voyaged to the hands of Mr.
Erskine; thence again to Argyle, where he sat between the other
two lords of session, and his Grace turned and fixed me with an
arrogant eye. The last of those interested in my presence was
Charlie Stewart, and he too began to pencil and hand about dispatches,
none of which I was able to trace to their destination in the
crowd.</p>

<p>But the passage of these notes had aroused notice; all who were
in the secret (or supposed themselves to be so) were whispering
information—the rest questions; and the minister himself seemed
quite discountenanced by the flutter in the church and sudden
stir and whispering. His voice changed, he plainly faltered, nor
did he again recover the easy conviction and full tones of his
delivery. It would be a puzzle to him till his dying day, why
a sermon that had gone with triumph through four parts, should
thus miscarry in the fifth.</p>

<p>As for me, I continued to sit there, very wet and weary, and
a good deal anxious as to what should happen next, but greatly
exulting in my success.</p>
