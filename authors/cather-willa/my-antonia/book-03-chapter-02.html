<p>ONE MARCH EVENING in my sophomore year I was sitting alone in my room
after supper. There had been a warm thaw all day, with mushy yards and
little streams of dark water gurgling cheerfully into the streets out of
old snow-banks. My window was open, and the earthy wind blowing through
made me indolent. On the edge of the prairie, where the sun had gone
down, the sky was turquoise blue, like a lake, with gold light throbbing
in it. Higher up, in the utter clarity of the western slope, the evening
star hung like a lamp suspended by silver chains--like the lamp engraved
upon the title-page of old Latin texts, which is always appearing in new
heavens, and waking new desires in men. It reminded me, at any rate, to
shut my window and light my wick in answer. I did so regretfully, and
the dim objects in the room emerged from the shadows and took their
place about me with the helpfulness which custom breeds.
</p><p>I propped my book open and stared listlessly at the page of the
‘Georgics’ where tomorrow’s lesson began. It opened with the melancholy
reflection that, in the lives of mortals the best days are the first to
flee. ‘Optima dies... prima fugit.’ I turned back to the beginning of
the third book, which we had read in class that morning. ‘Primus ego in
patriam mecum... deducam Musas’; ‘for I shall be the first, if I live,
to bring the Muse into my country.’ Cleric had explained to us that
‘patria’ here meant, not a nation or even a province, but the little
rural neighbourhood on the Mincio where the poet was born. This was not
a boast, but a hope, at once bold and devoutly humble, that he might
bring the Muse (but lately come to Italy from her cloudy Grecian
mountains), not to the capital, the palatia Romana, but to his own
little I country’; to his father’s fields, ‘sloping down to the river
and to the old beech trees with broken tops.’
</p><p>Cleric said he thought Virgil, when he was dying at Brindisi, must have
remembered that passage. After he had faced the bitter fact that he was
to leave the ‘Aeneid’ unfinished, and had decreed that the great canvas,
crowded with figures of gods and men, should be burned rather than
survive him unperfected, then his mind must have gone back to the
perfect utterance of the ‘Georgics,’ where the pen was fitted to the
matter as the plough is to the furrow; and he must have said to himself,
with the thankfulness of a good man, ‘I was the first to bring the Muse
into my country.’
</p><p>We left the classroom quietly, conscious that we had been brushed by the
wing of a great feeling, though perhaps I alone knew Cleric intimately
enough to guess what that feeling was. In the evening, as I sat staring
at my book, the fervour of his voice stirred through the quantities on
the page before me. I was wondering whether that particular rocky strip
of New England coast about which he had so often told me was Cleric’s
patria. Before I had got far with my reading, I was disturbed by a
knock. I hurried to the door and when I opened it saw a woman standing
in the dark hall.
</p><p>‘I expect you hardly know me, Jim.’
</p><p>The voice seemed familiar, but I did not recognize her until she stepped
into the light of my doorway and I beheld--Lena Lingard! She was so
quietly conventionalized by city clothes that I might have passed her
on the street without seeing her. Her black suit fitted her figure
smoothly, and a black lace hat, with pale-blue forget-me-nots, sat
demurely on her yellow hair.
</p><p>I led her toward Cleric’s chair, the only comfortable one I had,
questioning her confusedly.
</p><p>She was not disconcerted by my embarrassment. She looked about her with
the naive curiosity I remembered so well. ‘You are quite comfortable
here, aren’t you? I live in Lincoln now, too, Jim. I’m in business for
myself. I have a dressmaking shop in the Raleigh Block, out on O Street.
I’ve made a real good start.’
</p><p>‘But, Lena, when did you come?’
</p><p>‘Oh, I’ve been here all winter. Didn’t your grandmother ever write you?
I’ve thought about looking you up lots of times. But we’ve all heard
what a studious young man you’ve got to be, and I felt bashful. I didn’t
know whether you’d be glad to see me.’ She laughed her mellow, easy
laugh, that was either very artless or very comprehending, one never
quite knew which. ‘You seem the same, though--except you’re a young man,
now, of course. Do you think I’ve changed?’
</p><p>‘Maybe you’re prettier--though you were always pretty enough. Perhaps
it’s your clothes that make a difference.’
</p><p>‘You like my new suit? I have to dress pretty well in my business.’
</p><p>She took off her jacket and sat more at ease in her blouse, of some
soft, flimsy silk. She was already at home in my place, had slipped
quietly into it, as she did into everything. She told me her business
was going well, and she had saved a little money.
</p><p>‘This summer I’m going to build the house for mother I’ve talked about
so long. I won’t be able to pay up on it at first, but I want her to
have it before she is too old to enjoy it. Next summer I’ll take her
down new furniture and carpets, so she’ll have something to look forward
to all winter.’
</p><p>I watched Lena sitting there so smooth and sunny and well-cared-for, and
thought of how she used to run barefoot over the prairie until after
the snow began to fly, and how Crazy Mary chased her round and round
the cornfields. It seemed to me wonderful that she should have got on so
well in the world. Certainly she had no one but herself to thank for it.
</p><p>‘You must feel proud of yourself, Lena,’ I said heartily. ‘Look at me;
I’ve never earned a dollar, and I don’t know that I’ll ever be able to.’
</p><p>‘Tony says you’re going to be richer than Mr. Harling some day. She’s
always bragging about you, you know.’
</p><p>‘Tell me, how IS Tony?’
</p><p>‘She’s fine. She works for Mrs. Gardener at the hotel now. She’s
housekeeper. Mrs. Gardener’s health isn’t what it was, and she can’t
see after everything like she used to. She has great confidence in Tony.
Tony’s made it up with the Harlings, too. Little Nina is so fond of her
that Mrs. Harling kind of overlooked things.’
</p><p>‘Is she still going with Larry Donovan?’
</p><p>‘Oh, that’s on, worse than ever! I guess they’re engaged. Tony talks
about him like he was president of the railroad. Everybody laughs about
it, because she was never a girl to be soft. She won’t hear a word
against him. She’s so sort of innocent.’
</p><p>I said I didn’t like Larry, and never would.
</p><p>Lena’s face dimpled. ‘Some of us could tell her things, but it wouldn’t
do any good. She’d always believe him. That’s Antonia’s failing, you
know; if she once likes people, she won’t hear anything against them.’
</p><p>‘I think I’d better go home and look after Antonia,’ I said.
</p><p>‘I think you had.’ Lena looked up at me in frank amusement. ‘It’s a good
thing the Harlings are friendly with her again. Larry’s afraid of them.
They ship so much grain, they have influence with the railroad people.
What are you studying?’ She leaned her elbows on the table and drew my
book toward her. I caught a faint odour of violet sachet. ‘So that’s
Latin, is it? It looks hard. You do go to the theatre sometimes, though,
for I’ve seen you there. Don’t you just love a good play, Jim? I can’t
stay at home in the evening if there’s one in town. I’d be willing to
work like a slave, it seems to me, to live in a place where there are
theatres.’
</p><p>‘Let’s go to a show together sometime. You are going to let me come to
see you, aren’t you?’
</p><p>‘Would you like to? I’d be ever so pleased. I’m never busy after six
o’clock, and I let my sewing girls go at half-past five. I board, to
save time, but sometimes I cook a chop for myself, and I’d be glad to
cook one for you. Well’--she began to put on her white gloves--‘it’s
been awful good to see you, Jim.’
</p><p>‘You needn’t hurry, need you? You’ve hardly told me anything yet.’
</p><p>‘We can talk when you come to see me. I expect you don’t often have lady
visitors. The old woman downstairs didn’t want to let me come up very
much. I told her I was from your home town, and had promised your
grandmother to come and see you. How surprised Mrs. Burden would be!’
Lena laughed softly as she rose.
</p><p>When I caught up my hat, she shook her head. ‘No, I don’t want you to go
with me. I’m to meet some Swedes at the drugstore. You wouldn’t care for
them. I wanted to see your room so I could write Tony all about it, but
I must tell her how I left you right here with your books. She’s always
so afraid someone will run off with you!’ Lena slipped her silk sleeves
into the jacket I held for her, smoothed it over her person, and
buttoned it slowly. I walked with her to the door. ‘Come and see me
sometimes when you’re lonesome. But maybe you have all the friends
you want. Have you?’ She turned her soft cheek to me. ‘Have you?’ she
whispered teasingly in my ear. In a moment I watched her fade down the
dusky stairway.
</p><p>When I turned back to my room the place seemed much pleasanter than
before. Lena had left something warm and friendly in the lamplight.
How I loved to hear her laugh again! It was so soft and unexcited and
appreciative gave a favourable interpretation to everything. When I
closed my eyes I could hear them all laughing--the Danish laundry girls
and the three Bohemian Marys. Lena had brought them all back to me. It
came over me, as it had never done before, the relation between girls
like those and the poetry of Virgil. If there were no girls like them in
the world, there would be no poetry. I understood that clearly, for the
first time. This revelation seemed to me inestimably precious. I clung
to it as if it might suddenly vanish.
</p><p>As I sat down to my book at last, my old dream about Lena coming across
the harvest-field in her short skirt seemed to me like the memory of an
actual experience. It floated before me on the page like a picture, and
underneath it stood the mournful line: ‘Optima dies... prima fugit.’
