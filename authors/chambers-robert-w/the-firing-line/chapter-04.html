<p>Hamil awoke early: long before breakfast he was shaved, dressed,
and hungry; but in the hotel late rising appeared to be fashionable,
and through the bewildering maze of halls and corridors nobody
was yet astir except a few children and their maids.</p>

<p>So he sauntered about the acres of floor space from rotunda to
music room, from desk to sun parlour, through the endless carpeted
tunnel leading to the station, and back again, taking his bearings
in this wilderness of runways so profusely embowered with palms
and furniture.</p>

<p>In one wide corridor, lined like a street with shops, clerks
were rearranging show windows; and Hamil strolled from the jewellers
to the brilliant but dubious display of an Armenian rug dealer;
from a New York milliner's exhibition, where one or two blond,
sleepy-eyed young women moved languidly about, to an exasperating
show of shells, curiosities, and local photographs which quenched
further curiosity.</p>

<p>However, beyond the shops, at the distant end of an Axminster
vista flanked by cabbage-palms and masterpieces from Grand Rapids,
he saw sunshine and the green tops of trees; and he made toward
the oasis, coming out along a white colonnade overlooking the
hotel gardens.</p>

<p>It was early enough for any ambitious bird to sing, but there
were few song-birds in the gardens&mdash;a palm warbler or two, and
a pair of subdued mocking-birds not inclined to be tuneful. Everywhere,
however, purple and bronze grackle appeared, flying or walking
busily over the lawns, sunlight striking the rainbow hackle on
their necks, and their pale-yellow or bright-orange eyes staring
boldly at the gardeners who dawdled about the flowery labyrinths
with watering-can and jointed hose. And from every shrub and tree
came the mildly unpleasant calling of the grackle, and the blackbirds
along the lagoon answered with their own unmusical "Co-ca-<em>chee</em>!
&mdash;Co-ca-chee-e!"</p>

<p>Somehow, to Hamil, the sunshine seemed to reveal more petty defects
in this semi-tropical landscape than he could have divined the
night before under the unblemished magic of the stars. For the
grass was not real grass, but only that sparse, bunchy, sun-crisped
substitute from Bermuda; here and there wind-battered palmetto
fronds hung burnt and bronzed; and the vast hotel, which through
the darkness he had seen piled up above the trees in cliff-like
beauty against the stars, was actually remarkable only for its
size and lack of architectural interest.</p>

<p>He began to wonder whether the inhabitants of its thousand rooms,
aware of the pitiless clarity of this semi-tropical morning sunlight,
shunned it lest it reveal unsuspected defects in those pretty
lantern-lit faces of which he had had glimpses in the gardens'
enchanted dusk the night before. However, the sunshine seemed
to render the little children only the lovelier, and he sat on
the railing, his back against a pillar, watching them racing about
with their nurses, until the breakfast hour at last came around
and found him at table, no longer hungry.</p>

<p>A stream of old ladies and gentlemen continued toddling into
the breakfast rooms where an acre or two of tables, like a profuse
crop of mushrooms, disturbed the monotony of the hotel interior
with a monotony still more pronounced. However, there was hazy
sunshine in the place and a glimpse of blessed green outside,
and the leisurely negroes brought him fruit which was almost as
good as the New York winter markets afforded, and his breakfast
amused him mildly.</p>

<p>The people, too, amused him&mdash;so many dozens of old ladies and
gentlemen, all so remarkably alike in a common absence of distinguishing
traits&mdash;a sort of homogeneous, expressionless similarity which
was rather amazing as they doubtless had gathered there from all
sections of the Republic.</p>

<p>But the children were delightful, and all over the vast room
he could distinguish their fresh little faces like tufts of flowers
set in a waste of dusty stubble, and amid the culinary clatter
their clear, gay little voices broke through cheerfully at moments,
grateful as the morning chatter of sparrows in early spring.</p>

<p>When Hamil left his table he halted to ask an imposing head-waiter
whether Miss Palliser might be expected to breakfast, and was
informed that she breakfasted and lunched in her rooms and dined
always in the café.</p>

<p>So he stopped at the desk and sent up his card.</p>

<p>A number of young people evidently equipped for the golf links
now pervaded hall and corridor; others, elaborately veiled for
motoring, stopped at the desk for letters on their way into the
outer sunshine.</p>

<p>A row of rather silent but important-looking gentlemen, morning
cigars afire, gradually formed ranks in arm-chairs under the colonnade;
people passing and repassing began to greet each other with more
vivacity; veranda and foyer became almost animated as the crowd
increased. And now a demure bride or two emerged in all the radiance
of perfect love and raiment, squired by <em>him</em>, braving
the searching sunshine with confidence in her beauty, her plumage,
and a kindly planet; and, in pitiful contrast, here and there
some waxen-faced invalid, wheeled by a trained nurse, in cap and
cuffs, through sunless halls into the clear sea air, to lie motionless,
with leaden lids scarcely parted, in the glory of a perfect day.</p>

<p>A gentleman, rotund of abdomen, wearing a stubby red moustache,
screwed a cigar firmly into the off corner of his mouth and, after
looking aggressively at Hamil for fully half a minute, said:</p>

<p>"Southern Pacific sold off at the close."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Hamil.</p>

<p>"It's like picking daisies," said the gentleman impressively.
And, after a pause, during which he continued to survey the younger
man: "What name?" he inquired, as though Hamil had been persistently
attempting to inform him.</p>

<p>Hamil told him good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Hamil. My name is Rawley&mdash;probably
the name is familiar to you? &mdash;Ambrose Rawley"&mdash;he coughed&mdash;"by
profession a botanist."</p>

<p>Hamil smiled, recognising in the name the most outrageously expensive
of New York florists who had made a fortune in cut flowers.</p>

<p>"Have a drink?" persisted Mr. Rawley. "No? Too early for you?
Well, let's get a couple of niggers and wheel-chairs."</p>

<p>But Hamil declined with the easy good-humour which characterised
him; and a few moments later, learning at the office that his
aunt would receive him, followed his negro guide through endless
carpeted labyrinths and was ushered by a maid into a sunny reception-room.</p>

<p>"Garry!&mdash;you dear boy!" exclaimed his amazingly youthful aunt,
holding out both arms to him from the door of her bedroom, partly
ajar. "No&mdash;don't come near me; I'm not even in complete negligée
yet, but I will be in one minute when Titine fastens me up and
makes the most of my scanty locks&mdash;" She looked out at him with
a laugh and gave her head a little jerk forward, and her splendid
chestnut hair came tumbling down in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"You're prettier than ever," said her nephew; "they'll take us
for bride and groom as usual. I say, Constance, I suppose they've
followed you down here."</p>

<p>"Who, Garry,"&mdash;very innocently.</p>

<p>"The faithful three, Colonel Vetchen, Cuyp, and old &mdash;I
mean the gracefully mature Courtlandt Classon. Are they here?"</p>

<p>"I believe so, dear," admitted his aunt demurely. "And, Garry,
so is Virginia Suydam."</p>

<p>"Really," he said, suddenly subdued as his aunt who was forty
and looked twenty-five came forward in her pretty chamber-gown,
and placed two firm white arms around him and kissed him squarely
and with vigour.</p>

<p>"You dear!" she said; "you certainly are the best-looking boy
in all Florida. When did you come? Is Jim Wayward's yacht here
still? And why didn't he come to see me?"</p>

<p>"The <em>Ariani</em> sailed for Miami last night after I landed.
I left my card, but the office people rang and rang and could
get no answer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was in bed! How stupid of me! I retired early because Virginia
and I had been dissipating shamefully all the week and my aged
bones required a rest.... And now tell me all about this new commission
of yours. I have met the Cardross family; everybody at Palm Beach
is talking about the magnificent park Mr. Cardross is planning;
and your picture has appeared in the local paper, and I've told
everybody you're quite wonderful, and everybody now is informing
everybody else that you're quite wonderful!"</p>

<p>His very gay aunt lay back in her great soft chair, pushing with
both fair hands the masses of chestnut hair from her forehead,
and smiling at him out of her golden brown eyes&mdash;the jolliest,
frankest of eyes&mdash;the sort even women trust instinctively at first
glimpse.</p>

<p>So he sat there and told her all about his commission and how
this man, Neville Cardross, whom he had never even seen, had written
to him and asked him to make the most splendid park in America
around the Cardross villa, and had invited him to be his guest
during his stay in Florida.</p>

<p>"They evidently are nice people from the way Mr. Cardross writes,"
he said. "You say you know them, Constance?"</p>

<p>"I've met them several times&mdash;the way you meet people here. They
have a villa&mdash;rather imposing in an exotic fashion. Why, yes,
Garry, they <em>are</em> nice; dreadfully wealthy, tremendously
popular. Mrs. Carrick, the married daughter, is very agreeable;
her mother is amiable and dreadfully stout. Then there's a boy
of your age &mdash;Gray Cardross&mdash;a well-mannered youth who drives
motors, and whom Mr. Classon calls a 'speed-mad cub.' Then there
is Cecile Cardross&mdash;a débutante of last winter, and then&mdash;" Miss
Palliser hesitated, crossed one knee over the other, and sat gently
swinging her slippered foot and looking at her nephew.</p>

<p>"Does that conclude the list of the Cardross family?" he asked.</p>

<p>"N-no. There remains the beauty of the family, Shiela." She continued
to survey him with smiling intentness, and went on slowly:</p>

<p>"Shiela Cardross; <em>the</em> girl here. People are quite mad
about her, I assure you. My dear, every man at Palm Beach tags
after her; rows of callow youths sit and gaze at her very footprints
in the sand when she crosses the beach; she turns masculine heads
to the verge of permanent dislocation. No guilty man escapes;
even Courtlandt Classon is meditating treachery to me, and Mr.
Cuyp has long been wavering and Gussie Vetchen too! the wretch!...
We poor women try hard to like her&mdash;but, Garry, <em>is</em> it
human to love such a girl?"</p>

<p>"It's divine, Constance, so you'll like her."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; thank you. Well, I do; I don't know her well, but I'm
inclined to like her&mdash;in a way.... There's something else, though."
She considered her handsome nephew steadily. "You are to be a
guest there while this work of yours is in hand?"</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I believe so."</p>

<p>"Then, dear, without the slightest unworthy impulse or the faintest
trace of malice, I wish to put you on your guard. It's horrid,
but I must."</p>

<p>"On my guard!" he repeated.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "So he sat there and told her all about his commission."]</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;forearm you, Garry. Shiela Cardross is a rather bewildering
beauty. She is French convent-bred, clever and cultivated and
extremely talented. Besides that she has every fashionable grace
and accomplishment at the ends of her pretty fingers&mdash;and she
has a way with her&mdash;a way of looking at you&mdash;which is pure murder
to the average man. And beside that she is very simple and sweet
to everybody. As an assassin of hearts she's equipped to slay
yours, Garry."</p>

<p>"Well?" he inquired, laughing. And added: "Let her slay. Why
not?"</p>

<p>"This, dear. And you who know me will acquit me of any ignoble
motive if I say that she is not your social equal, Garry."</p>

<p>"What! I thought you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;about the others. But it is not the same with Shiela Cardross.
<em>I&mdash;</em>it seems cruel to say it&mdash;but it is for your sake&mdash;to
effectually forestall any possible accident&mdash;that I am going to
tell you that this very lovely girl, Shiela, is an adopted child,
not a daughter. That exceedingly horrid old gossip, Mrs. Van Dieman,
told me that the girl was a foundling taken by Mr. and Mrs. Cardross
from the Staten Island asylum. And I'm afraid Mrs. Van Dieman
knows what she's talking about because she founded and still supports
the asylum."</p>

<p>Hamil looked gravely across at his aunt. "The poor little girl,"
he said slowly. "Lord, but that's tough! and tougher still to
have Mrs. Van Dieman taking the trouble to spread the news. Can't
you shut her up?"</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> tough, Garret. I suppose they all are dreadfully
sensitive about it. I begged Mrs. Van Dieman to keep her own counsel.
But she won't. And you know, dear, that it would make no difference
to me in my relations with the girl&mdash;except that"&mdash;she hesitated,
smiling&mdash;"she is <em>not</em> good enough for you, Garry, and
so, if you catch the prevailing contagion, and fall a victim,
you have been inoculated now and will have the malady lightly."</p>

<p>"My frivolous and fascinating aunt," he said, "have you ever
known me to catch any prevailing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O Garret! You know you have!&mdash;dozens of times&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've been civilly attentive to several girls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness you'd marry Virginia Suydam; but you won't."</p>

<p>"Virginia!" he repeated, astonished.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do; I wish you were safely and suitably married. I'm
worried, Garry; you are becoming too good-looking not to get into
some horrid complication&mdash;as poor Jim Wayward did; and now he's
done for, finished! Oh, I wish I didn't feel so responsible for
you. And I <em>wish</em> you weren't going to the Cardrosses'
to live for months!"</p>

<p>He leaned forward, laughing, and took his aunt's slim hands between
his own sunburned fists. "You cunning little thing," he said,
"if you talk that way I'll marry you off to one of the faithful
three; you and Virginia too. Lord, do you think I'm down here
to cut capers when I've enough hard work ahead to drive a dozen
men crazy for a year? As for your beautiful Miss Cardross&mdash;why
I saw a girl in a boat&mdash;not long ago&mdash;who really was a beauty.
I mean to find her, some day; and that <em>is</em> something for
you to worry about!"</p>

<p>"Garry! <em>Tell</em> me!"</p>

<p>But he rose, still laughing, and saluted Miss Palliser's hands.</p>

<p>"If you and Virginia have nothing better on I'll dine with you
at eight. Yes? No?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Where are you going now?"</p>

<p>"To report to Mr. Cardross&mdash;and brave beauty in its bower," he
added mischievously. "I'll doubtless be bowled over first shot
and come around for a dinner and a blessing at eight this evening."</p>

<p>"Don't joke about it," she said as they rose together and stood
for a moment at the window looking down into the flowering gardens.</p>

<p>"Is it not a jolly scene?" she added&mdash;"the fountain against the
green, and the flowers and the sunshine everywhere, and all those
light summer gowns outdoors in January, and&mdash;" She checked herself
and laid her hand on his arm; "Garry, do you see that girl in
the wheel-chair!&mdash;the one just turning into the gardens!"</p>

<p>He had already seen her. Suddenly his heart stood still in dread
of what his aunt was about to say. He knew already somehow that
she was going to say it, yet when she spoke the tiny shock came
just the same.</p>

<p>"That," said his aunt, "is Shiela Cardross. Is she not too lovely
for words?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "she is very beautiful."</p>

<p>For a while they stood together there at the window, then he
said good-bye in a rather subdued manner which made his aunt laugh
that jolly, clear laugh which never appealed to him in vain.</p>

<p>"You're not mortally stricken already at your first view of her,
are you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not mortally," he said.</p>

<p>"Then fall a victim and recover quickly. And <em>don't</em> let
me sit here too long without seeing you; will you?"</p>

<p>She went to the door with him, one arm linked in his, brown eyes
bright with her pride and confidence in him&mdash;in this tall, wholesome,
clean-built boy, already on the verge of distinction in his rather
unusual profession. And she saw in him all the strength and engaging
good looks of his dead father, and all the clear and lovable sincerity
of his mother&mdash;her only sister&mdash;now also dead.</p>

<p>"You <em>will</em> come to see me sometimes&mdash;won't you, Garry?"
she repeated wistfully.</p>

<p>"Of course I will. Give my love to Virginia and my amused regards
to the faithful three."</p>

<p>And so they parted, he to saunter down into the cool gardens
on his way to call on Mr. Cardross; she to pace the floor, excited
by his arrival, her heart beating with happiness, pride, solicitude
for the young fellow who was like brother and son to her&mdash;this
handsome, affectionate, generous boy who had steadily from the
very first declined to accept one penny of her comfortable little
fortune lest she be deprived of the least luxury or convenience,
and who had doggedly educated and prepared himself, and contrived
to live within the scanty means he had inherited.</p>

<p>And now at last the boy saw success ahead, and Miss Palliser
was happy, dreaming brilliant dreams for him, conjuring vague
splendours for the future&mdash;success unbounded, honours, the esteem
of all good men; this, for her boy. And&mdash;if it must be&mdash;love,
in its season&mdash;with the inevitable separation and a slow dissolution
of an intimacy which had held for her all she desired in life&mdash;his
companionship, his happiness, his fortune; this also she dreamed
for his sake. Yes&mdash;knowing she could not always keep him, and
that it must come inexorably, she dreamed of love for him&mdash;and
marriage.</p>

<p>And, as she stood now by the sunny window, idly intent on her
vision, without warning the face of Shiela Cardross glimmered
through the dream, growing clearer, distinct in every curve and
tint of its exquisite perfection; and she stared at the mental
vision, evoking it with all the imagination of her inner consciousness,
unquiet yet curious, striving to look into the phantom's eyes&mdash;clear,
direct eyes which she remembered; and a thrill of foreboding touched
her, lest the boy she loved might find in the sweetness of these
clear eyes a peril not lightly overcome.</p>

<p>"She is so unusually beautiful," said Miss Palliser aloud, unconscious
that she had spoken. And she added, wondering, "God knows what
blood is in her veins to form a body so divine."</p>
