<p>The voyage of the "Nautilus" was uneventful until she was far
to the northward in Baffin Bay. It was long after leaving St.
John that our friends saw their first iceberg. They should have
seen them before, as Captain McAlpine explained, for, as you well
know, those mountains of ice often cross the path of the Atlantic
steamers, and more than once have endangered our great ocean greyhounds.
No doubt numbers of them were drifting southward, gradually dissolving
as they neared the equator, but it so happened that the "Nautilus"
steered clear of them until many degrees to the north.</p>

<p>The captain, who was scanning the icy ocean with his glass, apprised
the boys that the longed-for curiosity was in sight at last. As
he spoke, he pointed with his hand to the north-west, but though
they followed the direction with their eyes, they were disappointed.</p>

<p>"I see nothing," said Rob, "that looks like an iceberg."</p>

<p>"And how is it with you, Mr. Warburton?" asked the skipper, lowering
his instrument, and turning toward the younger of the boys, who
had approached, and now stood at his side.</p>

<p>"We can make out a small white cloud in the horizon, that's all,"
said Fred.</p>

<p>"It's the cloud I'm referring to, boys; now take a squint at
that same thing through the glass."</p>

<p>Fred leveled the instrument and had hardly taken a glance, when
he cried:</p>

<p>"Oh! it's an iceberg sure enough! Isn't it beautiful?"</p>

<p>While he was studying it, the captain added: "Turn the glass
a little to the left."</p>

<p>"There's another!" added the delighted youth.</p>

<p>"I guess we've struck a school of 'em," remarked Rob, who was
using his eyes as best he could; "I thought we'd bring up the
average before reaching Greenland."</p>

<p>"It's a sight worth seeing," commented Fred, handing the glass
to his friend, whose pleasure was fully as great as his own.</p>

<p>The instrument was passed back and forth, and, in the course
of a half-hour, the vast masses of ice could be plainly discerned
with the unaided eye.</p>

<p>"That proves they are coming toward us, or we are going toward
them," said Rob.</p>

<p>"Both," replied Captain McAlpine; "we shall pass within a mile
of the larger one."</p>

<p>"Suppose we run into it?"</p>

<p>The old sea-dog smiled grimly, as he replied:</p>

<p>"I tried it once, when whaling with the 'Mary Jane.' I don't
mean to say I did it on purpose, but there was no moon that night,
and when the iceberg, half as big as a whole town, loomed up in
the darkness, we hadn't time to get out of its path. Well, I guess
I've said enough," he remarked, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Why, you've broken off in the most interesting part of the story,"
said the deeply interested Fred.</p>

<p>"Well, that was the last of the 'Mary Jane.' The mate, Jack Cosgrove,
and myself were all that escaped out of a crew of eleven. We managed
to climb upon a small shelf of ice, just above the water, where
we would have perished with cold had not an Esquimau fisherman,
named Docak, seen us. We were nearer the mainland than we dared
hope, and he came out in his kayak and took us off. He helped
us to make our way to Ivignut, where the cryolite mines are, and
thence we got back to England by way of Denmark. No," added Captain
McAlpine, "a prudent navigator won't try to butt an iceberg out
of his path; it don't pay."</p>

<p>"It must be dangerous in these waters, especially at night."</p>

<p>"There is danger everywhere and at all times in this life," was
the truthful remark of the commander; "and you know that the most
constant watchfulness on the part of the great steamers cannot
always avert disaster, but I have little fear of anything from
icebergs."</p>

<p>You need to be told little about those mountains of ice which
sometimes form a procession, vast, towering, and awful, that stream
down from the far North and sail in all their sublime grandeur
steadily southward until they "go out of commission" forever in
the tepid waters of the tropic regions.</p>

<p>It is a strange spectacle to see one of them moving resistlessly
against the current, which is sometimes dashed from the corrugated
front, as is seen at the bow of a steamboat, but the reason is
simple. Nearly seven-eighths of an iceberg is under water, extending
so far down that most of the bulk is often within the embrace
of the counter current below. This, of course, carries it against
the weaker flow, and causes many people to wonder how it can be
thus.</p>

<p>While the little group stood forward talking of icebergs, they
were gradually drawing near the couple that had first caught their
attention. By this time a third had risen to sight, more to the
westward, but it was much smaller than the other two, though more
unique and beautiful. It looked for all the world like a grand
cathedral, whose tapering spire towered fully two hundred feet
in air. It was easy to imagine that some gigantic structure had
been submerged by a flood, while the steeple still reared its
head above the surrounding waters as though defying them to do
their worst.</p>

<p>The other two bergs were much more enormous and of irregular
contour. The imaginative spectator could fancy all kinds of resemblances,
but the "cold fact" remained that they were simply mountains of
ice, with no more symmetry of outline than a mass of rock blasted
from a quarry.</p>

<p>"I have read," said Fred, "that in the iceberg factories of the
north, as they are called, they are sometimes two or three years
in forming, before they break loose and sweep off into the ocean."</p>

<p>"That is true," added Captain McAlpine; "an iceberg is simply
a chunk off a frozen river, and a pretty good-sized one, it must
be admitted. Where the cold is so intense, a river becomes frozen
from the surface to the ground. Snow falls, there may be a little
rain during the moderate season, then snow comes again, and all
the time the water beneath is freezing more and more solid. Gravity
and the pressure of the inconceivable weight beyond keeps forcing
the bulk of ice and snow nearer the ocean, until it projects into
the clear sea. By and by it breaks loose, and off it goes."</p>

<p>"But why does it take so long?"</p>

<p>"It is like the glaciers of the Alps. Being solid as a rock while
the pressure is gradual as well as resistless, it may move only
a few feet in a month or a year; but all the same the end must
come."</p>

<p>The captain had grown fond of the boys, and the fact that the
father of one of them was a director of the company which employed
him naturally led him to seek to please them so far as he could
do so consistent with his duty. He caused the course of the "Nautilus"
to be shifted, so that they approached within a third of a mile
of the nearest iceberg, which then was due east.</p>

<p>Sail had been slackened and the progress of the mass was so slow
as to be almost imperceptible. This gave full time for its appalling
grandeur to grow upon the senses of the youths, who stood minute
after minute admiring the overwhelming spectacle, speechless and
awed as is one who first pauses at the base of Niagara.</p>

<p>Naturally the officers and crew of the "Nautilus" gave the sight
some attention, but it could not impress them as it did those
who looked upon it for the first time.</p>

<p>The second iceberg was more to the northward, and the ship was
heading directly toward it. It was probably two-thirds the size
of the first, and, instead of possessing its rugged regularity
of outline, had a curious, one-sided look.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," remarked Rob, who had been studying it for
some moments, "that the centre of gravity in that fellow must
be rather ticklish."</p>

<p>"It may be more stable than the big one," said Fred, "for you
don't know what shape they have under water; a good deal must
depend on that."</p>

<p>Jack Cosgrove, the sailor, who had joined the little party at
the invitation of the captain, ventured to say:</p>

<p>"Sometimes them craft get top-heavy and take a flop; I shouldn't
be s'prised if that one done the same."</p>

<p>"It must be a curious sight; I've often wondered how Jumbo, the
great elephant, would have looked turning a somersault. An iceberg
performing a handspring would be something of the same order,
but a hundred thousand times more extensive. I would give a good
deal if one of those bergs should take it into his head to fling
a handspring, but I don't suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look!" broke in Fred, in sudden excitement.</p>

<p>To the unbounded amazement of captain, crew, and all the spectators,
the very thing spoken of by Rob Carrol took place. The vast bulk
of towering ice was seen to plunge downward with a motion, slow
at first, but rapidly increasing until it dived beneath the waves
like some enormous mass of matter cast off by a planet in its
flight through space. As it disappeared, two-fold as much bulk
came to view, there was a swirl of water, which was flung high
in fountains, and the waves formed by the commotion, as they swept
across the intervening space, caused the "Nautilus" to rock like
a cradle.</p>

<p>The splash could have been heard miles away, and the iceberg
seemed to shiver and shake itself, as though it were some flurried
monster of the deep, before it could regain its full equilibrium.
Then, as the spectators looked, behold! where was one of those
mountains of ice they saw what seemed to be another, for its shape,
contour, projections, and depressions were so different that no
resemblance could be traced.</p>

<p>"She's all right now," remarked Jack Cosgrove, whose emotions
were less stirred than those of any one else; "she's good for
two or three thousand miles' voyage, onless she should happen
to run aground in shoal water."</p>

<p>"What then would take place, Jack?" asked Fred.</p>

<p>"Wal, there would be the mischief to pay gener'ly. Things would
go ripping, tearing, and smashing, and the way that berg would
behave would be shameful. If anybody was within reach he'd get
hurt."</p>

<p>Rob stepped up to the sailor as if a sudden thought had come
to him. Laying his hand on his arm, he said, in an undertone:</p>

<p>"I wonder if the captain won't let us visit that iceberg?"</p>
