<p>At twelve-thirty Mr. Rooney was still in the theater with his
property-man and his electrician, but just before one he left through
the stage-door.
</p>
<p>"All over, old man, you can put out your lights, lock up, and beat it,"
he said to the old gentleman who had sat year after year and kept the
gates of his Inferno.
</p><p>"Star still in her dressing-room, gent with her," the old keeper
answered, as he leered at Mr. Rooney, and accepted the big black cigar
offered him.
</p><p>"Big, red-headed chap with the show?" Mr. Rooney questioned carelessly.
</p><p>"Same," admitted the old keeper.
</p><p>"Cuss her," Mr. Rooney remarked, without either special interest or
malice, and took his leisurely way to his hotel.
</p><p>The star dressing-room at the little Atlantic City theater, in which
half the plays produced on Broadway first try out their charm, is larger
than the dressing-rooms in most of the modern theaters, and dainty
Susette always made any dressing-room which happened to serve Miss
Hawtry look more like a boudoir than seemed possible, by taking thought
to have silky rose curtains to adjust over costume-racks and windows,
with covers to match to be slipped over the couple of rough chairs
usually supplied dressing-rooms. A fillet covering large enough for any
dressing-table, the silver and ivory of the make-up outfit, and lights
shaded with the fillet over rose were about all the equipment that the
French girl carried in the top of one of Miss Hawtry's costume trunks,
but she managed an effect with them that many a Fifth Avenue decorator
might envy. Following instructions, she had put all in exquisite order
and left the theater before Miss Hawtry was off the stage. The Violet
had been obliged to send her summons to Mr. Dennis Farraday by the old
door-keeper; hence his knowledge of her manoeuvers.
</p><p>Miss Hawtry was still encased in the magnificence of the costume for the
final scene of "The Purple Slipper," and in the rose light of the little
dressing-room she glowed like a fire-hearted opal as Mr. Dennis Farraday
entered with the great hesitation of a first appearance in a stage
dressing-room. His face was pale and serious. Miss Hawtry had seen that
her Maggie Murphy insult to Mr. Vandeford had apparently cut more deeply
into the big Jonathan than into Mr. Vandeford himself, and she had
realized that she must set her scene well and act quickly and with
daring if she accomplished her purposes.
</p><p>"Forgive me--and comfort me. I have hurt myself more than I have hurt
him," she cried out as she turned to him and expelled two sparkling
tears from her great blue eyes, and held out bare, white, glorious arms
to him, with the sob of a repentant child caught in her throat.
</p><p>Now, Mr. Dennis Farraday, great gentleman and the son of a line of
gentlemen, was in the same state that many another good man and true
would be in after witnessing "The Purple Slipper" as played by Miss
Hawtry in her compelling animality, and his angry eyes suddenly blazed
with another light than anger, as with a hard breath he admitted the
big, beautiful, treacherous cat into his arms and allowed her bare arms
to coil around his neck and her body to cling to his.
</p><p>"How could you--how can you?" he asked, and the question on his lips
made them cold, and kept them from hers--long enough.
</p><p>Mr. Vandeford stood in the dressing-room door without so much as rapping
for permission to enter, and his face was dead white while his eyes
blazed in a great terror. He seemed not to notice the purport of the
scene he had interrupted, but his voice cut into the situation like cold
steel.
</p><p>"Denny, we can't find Miss Adair anywhere, and here's a note she left
Miss Lindsey. What do you make of it?" He handed Mr. Farraday a sheet of
hotel note-paper, which he took with a trembling hand while Miss Hawtry
shrank back against her lace-covered dressing-table and gathered her
forces to annihilate Mr. Vandeford. This was the note, which Mr.
Farraday read with one glance, but failed to read to Miss Hawtry,
because its few lines struck all consciousness of her existence entirely
from his mind.
</p><p>     <u>Dear Mildred</u>:
</p><pre>
     Dishonor has never smirched the name of Adair until I put it on
     that theater program. I have branded the annals of my family, and I
     never want to look into a human face again. Good-by. You've been
     good to me.</pre>
<p><strong>PATRICIA.</strong>
</p><p>"My God! What do you suppose she means?" Mr. Farraday gasped, as he
looked in abject terror at Mr. Vandeford, who returned his glance in
kind.
</p><p>"And I promised Roger to take care of her," Mr. Farraday gasped, and
without so much as a glance at Miss Hawtry, both men departed with all
the rapidity possible. There must be some reason that all bonds
without-the-law are so brittle, and those of friendship and honor and
love so strong within the code.
</p><p>Miss Hawtry did some rapid thinking, as unaided, she slipped from the
costume of the star of "The Purple Slipper" into her normal raiment and
character. Then she called a wheel-chair and had herself trundled to the
hotel. While she was propelled, many other wheels were turning and
turning fast.
</p><p>"What does Miss Lindsey think is the matter, and where she is?" Mr.
Farraday questioned Mr. Vandeford as they strode along together down the
board-walk towards the hotel.
</p><p>"She says it's that rotten scene between Hawtry and Height that's killed
her, and she is right. I felt her die right there by my side," Mr.
Vandeford answered.
</p><p>"You two don't think she would really put an end to--to herself about a
play, do you?" demanded Mr. Farraday, and he fairly staggered as he
asked the question. Then not waiting for an answer, he began to run
toward the entrance of the hotel half a block ahead. Just as he was
turning into the doors with Mr. Vandeford closely following, an Italian
wheel-chair boy darted out of the dusk of his stand, and plucked the
latter by the sleeve; then together they went racing back the way Mr.
Vandeford had come.
</p><p>Half way down the long arbor, dusky under its vines, Mr. Farraday met
Miss Lindsey, and in the subdued light they paused and looked into each
other's faces; then entirely to the surprise of them both, they went
into each other's arms and clung together like two frightened children.
Miss Lindsey was smothering sobs which made her tender breast storm
against Mr. Farraday's, in whose own a heart was racing with terror.
</p><p>"I don't blame her; it was loathsome, and it was about her own
grandmother," Miss Lindsey managed to say in a fierce, beautiful voice.
</p><p>"You don't think, do you, that--" Mr. Farraday was gasping as he held
Miss Lindsey still tighter against the racing heart, which was beginning
to slow down and pound against hers with a slightly different speed.
However, the terror in his voice made Miss Lindsey press him to her with
sustaining closeness.
</p><p>"She's Southern and different, and I don't know what to think," she was
saying, and in the absorption of their terror they failed to notice that
Miss Hawtry passed them not six feet away in her wicker chair.
</p><p>And while they clung to each other and enjoyed their fright and anxiety
together, Miss Hawtry went into the telephone-booth and got a
long-distance connection with Mr. Weiner in New York in an incredibly
short time. Their conversation was almost as incredibly short in view of
its portentousness, but while it lasted, Mr. Gerald Height and Mr.
William Rooney had been added to the group of anxiety under the arbor,
and they were all in close conclave, though not in embrace, when Miss
Hawtry returned to them, walking with cool determination in every step.
</p><p>"Mr. Farraday," Miss Hawtry said, with a serenity in her rich voice and
manner, "I will have to tell you as Mr. Vandeford's partner in 'The
Purple Slipper' that I am entirely dissatisfied with the way the play
proves up at dress rehearsal and refuse to open in it. As I am under no
contract to him since Saturday night, I am motoring back to New York
to-night to begin rehearsals to-morrow in 'The Rosie Posie Girl' for Mr.
Weiner. Good-night!" With a stately curtsy to the assembled principals
of "The Purple Slipper," very dramatic in execution, the Violet bowed
herself away from them forever. Ten minutes after she was on her way
back to Manhattan in a big touring-car provided by the hotel management
per a telephone order from Mr. Weiner of New York.
</p><p>"And Van sold 'The Rosie Posie Girl,' for her opening on Broadway in the
New Carnival Theater with 'The Purple Slipper,'" Mr. Farraday gasped as
he sat down suddenly on one of the benches in the dim little arbor.
</p><p>"Lord, what a lose, both shows and maybe--maybe Miss Adair, too," Mr.
Gerald Height exclaimed, and there were both sympathy and anxiety in his
voice.
</p><p>"Oh, I don't know," said Mr. Rooney, as he rolled his fat cigar from the
left of his mouth to the right and spat into the vines. "I've made a
pretty good play out of 'The Purple Slipper.' It will go all right
without her. Actors aren't so much. It's the situation and the
stage-managing."
</p><p>"That's what you think," jeered Mr. Gerald Height, gloomily. "I always
had a hunch that I would never play wig and ruffles."
</p><p>"Can that hunch," commanded Mr. Rooney. "I'm going to put Miss Lindsey
in the part and play it refined for a winner. Been understudying Miss
Hawtry, haven't you, Miss Lindsey?"
</p><p>"Yes," answered Miss Lindsey, and a sudden radiance shone from her dark,
intellectual face that lit up the whole arbor and lighted a flame in the
creative hearts of both Mr. Gerald Height and Mr. William Rooney. And
what it lighted in the hearts of both of those gentlemen was nothing to
the blaze it fanned in the heart of Mr. Dennis Farraday, where it had
been smouldering along from a spark touched off the day of the beefsteak
and mushrooms. "If you'll help me play it as I have seen it all along,
Mr. Rooney, I can go on to-morrow night."
</p><p>"Good," agreed Mr. Rooney. "I'll shove Miss Grayson up into your part,
and cut out hers until we get a girl. We'll get the little author busy
right now, blotting out the Hawtry smell and putting you in, as I say,
refined and--"
</p><p>"Oh, but where <u>is</u> she?" moaned Mr. Farraday, coming back to his agony
of uneasiness, which had been drugged by hearing and seeing "The Purple
Slipper" and Mr. Vandeford's fortunes rescued and reconstructed right
before his ears and eyes.
</p><p>"There ain't but two places for a refined lady to run in Atlantic
City,--the railroad station and the ocean,--and I bet Mr. Vandeford is
lugging her from the railroad station right now," Mr. Rooney said with
easy conviction. "Course she'd dodge back to the Christian ladies home
the first mud-puddle she stepped into, but we'll set her on her feet and
rub the splashes off her white stockings and--"
</p><p>Mr. Rooney was interrupted in his kindly flow of reassurance by the
appearance of a wheel-chair propelled by the shrewd Italian youth, who
had that evening made his individual fortune, in which sat Mr. Vandeford
and the author of "The Purple Slipper." Without command, he stopped
beside the group of friends, and Mr. Vandeford alighted, but Miss Adair
shrank back into the shadow of the perambulator.
</p><p>"Oh, darling, listen," cried Miss Lindsey, as she reached into that
retreat and drew Miss Adair into her arms. "Miss Hawtry has thrown up
the part and gone back to New York, and I am going to act it for you
just as you and I have talked about it all this time. Mr. Rooney is
going to help us, and we--we are going to make good for you--and Mr.
Vandeford--to-morrow night. We are!"
</p><p>"Just watch us, Miss Adair. I'll do my best, and I'll--I'll be like we
talked the other day," Mr. Height said as he came to the other side of
the wicker retreat of the hunted author. Something in his voice made Mr.
Dennis Farraday put his arm around the lizard's shoulders, a thing he
would not have thought of doing a week ago.
</p><p>"We are all going to stand by, little girl, and it'll be some play that
we produce at the New Carnival October first," Mr. Farraday put in by
way of his contribution to the wounded young author.
</p><p>However, it was the crack of Mr. Rooney's whip that brought her to her
feet again.
</p><p>"Miss Adair, you and Lindsey come back with me to the theater now," he
commanded the shrinking and tragic author. "Somebody get Fido and tell
him to wake up everybody and have 'em all at the theater to rehearse in
a hour; that'll be three o'clock. Mr. Vandeford, you'd better get in a
press story over long distance before Hawtry beats you to it. You may
catch a morning paper or two. Now, everybody get out and work like fun
and we'll show Broadway a sure-fire hit October first."
</p><p>"Can you do it, Bill?" Mr. Vandeford asked in a quiet voice. It was the
first time he had spoken since he had coolly and silently picked Miss
Adair up off a bench in the little railroad station and put her into the
sympathetic young Dago's one-man-power conveyance.
</p><p>"I can take ten yards of calico, a pot of red wagon paint, and a pretty
gal and make a show to fill any theater on Broadway for six months--if
I'm let alone," answered Mr. Rooney, with the assurance that moves
mountains. "That Lindsey is one good actor with common horse-sense, and
the little author filly has Blue-grass speed. Watch us!"
</p><p>"Goes!" answered Mr. Vandeford, and steel sparks struck out in his keen
eyes as he turned and went rapidly to one of the long-distance telephone
booths with which all Atlantic City keeps up its intimate relations with
New York. It was also astonishing how quickly he got his connection with
a great New York morning paper and was put on the desk wire of one of
the junior editors, who was a good friend in need.
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Hello, Curt. Godfrey Vandeford speaking."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"With my show in Atlantic City. Can you get a note across in the morning
issue?"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Good! Spread it that Hawtry is put out of 'The Purple Slipper' cast to
give place to a new Pacific Coast star, Mildred Lindsey. Hawtry handed
it to Denny and me rotten, but put that under pretty deep, with Lindsey
blazed in top lines. I'll have my publicity man send you a special
Lindsey Sunday story. Hot stuff."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Thanks, old man! By!"
</p><hr/>
<p>Another fifteen minutes was spent in long distance communication with
Mr. Meyers, and it was ten minutes after three o'clock in the morning
when Mr. Vandeford slipped into his chair beside his author in the
little Atlantic City Theater, which Mr. Rooney had induced the old night
watchman door-keeper to open up at the hour when all teeming Atlantic
City is in the depths of repose. Mr. Rooney had with him the entire cast
of "The Purple Slipper," to whom he had just finished explaining the
cause of their extraction from their well-earned repose.
</p><p>"Most of the Sister Harriet scenes are with me," Miss Bébé Herne was
saying, with efficient energy fairly radiating from her big body,
clothed in a decorous tailor skirt, but with a boudoir jacket serving
for blouse. Also two kid curlers showed at the nape of her neck. "I can
feed Miss Grayson into Miss Lindsey's part enough to get by
to-morrow--to-night I mean. And Wallace can do the same when he's on
with her. That ugly white cat Hawtry to double on Godfrey Vandeford
after he pulled her out of Weehawken!"
</p><p>"Get on, get on, everybody, and use your brains until they lather,"
commanded Mr. Rooney as he took his stand beside the left stage box.
"Now, Miss, you gimme lines out of your head or your first draft when I
call for 'em, and I'll take 'em or leave 'em as suits me. Then you
smooth the ones I hand you into good talk, and we'll have a show here
by sun-up that you'll be proud to invite your Christian lady friends to
attend. And we'll keep all the 'pep' too, Vandeford, that you paid
Howard to write into it, only we'll take the Hawtry dirt out of it. On,
Betty Carrington, and the curtain's up."
</p><p>Then from three o'clock in the morning until almost noon the machinery
of "The Purple Slipper" was overhauled and adjusted to the new cog. Mr.
Rooney lashed and rubbed and polished and oiled with never a let-up on
anybody, and beside him sat the author, with her head up and the bit in
her mouth. For every line that rang untrue in the reconstruction she had
a true one or she took a crude bit from Mr. Rooney and polished it into
place. Fido sat crouched in a front seat and transcribed every word into
his prompt copy so as to be a veritable first aid.
</p><p>And Mr. Godfrey Vandeford, experienced show man that he was, felt as if
he was witnessing a miracle as he beheld Miss Adair's original "Purple
Slipper," with its haphazard amateur charm, again put forth bud and
bloom on the branches of Grant Howard's tight-knit, well-constructed,
and well-rounded drama. The highly-colored flowers of Hawtry personality
Mr. Rooney pruned away and constructed others for Lindsey, and Miss
Adair lent them color and perfume in passing them to the new star, who
was working steadily, slowly, surely, and with great power.
</p><p>"Don't tell him that his eyes 'burn into yours until your soul is
seared.' That's old. We got to get a kind of smile here where Hawtry
looked like she was going to do the ham sandwich act to Height and his
silk tights." Mr. Rooney stopped the abhorred scene, being acted along
about six o'clock in the morning, to demand that it be played in the
proper key, up to which he had succeeded in wringing lines from Miss
Adair for the first act and most of the second. "What do hearts do to
each other that's hot and decent and funny all at once?" Mr. Rooney
fired this biological question to the author of "The Purple Slipper,"
and looked at her with a demand for an immediate answer in his little,
black, driving eyes.
</p><p>"She can say 'There's chaff in my heart; guard the fire in yours,'" Miss
Adair supplied offhand.
</p><p>"That hands it to him, and a good double meaning, too," Mr. Rooney
approved. "Go ahead, Height, but don't get this lady mixed with the
other kind. Remember, she lives at the ladies Christian home." The laugh
that greeted this sally was an uproar that added to the dash and quick
fire of the big scene, which Miss Adair and Mr. Rooney had so quickly
expurgated and reconstructed between them.
</p><p>At seven o'clock the play had been entirely run through, and Fido had
the result in his prompt copy and was beginning to rapidly write it into
their lines for each of the cast.
</p><p>"One half hour to get breakfast and Miss Herne's back hair down," Mr.
Rooney said, with the callousness of a slave-driver. "Then if you run
through again fairly well we'll be done by noon, and everybody can hit
the hay for six hours."
</p><p>Mr. Vandeford watched his author's proud little head droop on the box
rail in front of her, and with his face very white he motioned Mr.
Farraday to come to her. After his degrading the night before at the
hands of Miss Hawtry, he felt that he would be unable to endure the pain
of the repulsion he felt sure he would find in her eyes if she ever
looked at him again.
</p><p>But his summons of Mr. Farraday failed in peremptoriness, for that big,
bonny gentleman nodded to him, then stood in the wing to catch Miss
Lindsey in his arms and bear her away to immediate nourishment. In the
excitement of the last few hours a domesticity had grown up between Mr.
Farraday and Miss Lindsey that it would have taken months to build in a
world less hectic than that in which they were then living.
</p><p>Their courtship had been brief, and consisted in one question, asked by
Mr. Farraday while Miss Lindsey stood in the wings waiting for a
moderated, impassioned cue from Mr. Height, and answered by her as she
responded to him and the call of her stage lover at the same moment.
</p><p>"When will you marry me?"
</p><p>"When 'The Purple Slipper' goes on Broadway."
</p><p>In the circumstances it was natural that Mr. Dennis Farraday should take
Miss Lindsey for a reminiscent beefsteak and mushrooms during the only
free half hour she would have for either him or food in the ensuing day,
and to fail to heed Mr. Vandeford's summon.
</p><p>Thus deserted, Mr. Vandeford was about to steal forth and appeal to some
member of the cast of "The Purple Slipper" to come to his rescue in
providing refreshment to restore the author during the precious half
hour respite when "the chaff in his heart" caught fire and began to burn
away forever. Miss Adair raised her eyes to his, with the faith still
in their wounded depths, and smiled a wan little smile.
</p><p>"Please get me a glass of milk with an egg in it, and some of that
brown-bread turkey," she demanded. "I'm dead, but I'll come alive again
if I go to sleep a minute. Shake me when you get back with it, but get
something for yourself while you are gone."
</p><p>"The kiddie, the precious, spunky kiddie," Mr. Vandeford said in his
heart over and over as he and the young Italian rushed to the hotel and
back with a waiter and a tray of the desired refreshment, to which had
been added an iced melon and a couple of bedewed roses.
</p><p>The shaking had to be literally administered while young Dago Italiana
held the tray, and then had to be repeated several times by Mr.
Vandeford, as he almost as literally fed his exhausted author, up until
the very minute in which Mr. Rooney rang up the curtain and again called
her into action.
</p><p>Five hours was more than enough for the smooth running of the three-hour
"Purple Slipper" show, and at eleven o'clock Mr. Rooney dismissed his
jaded cast with this strict command delivered in his rich, deep voice,
which held a note of genuine solemnity.
</p><p>"All of you go to sleep every minute between now and night, and then
come back here and make good--for all of us."
</p><p>With the assistance of young Dago Italiana, Mr. Vandeford delivered Miss
Adair to a hotel maid, who accepted five dollars from him as a fee for
putting her to bed, and then he plunged into still greater
strenuosities.
</p><p>He sat for three hours with his skilled young publicity man and
advance-agent, and laid out a discreet, dignified, but very interesting,
publicity campaign for the new star of "The Purple Slipper." Due
importance was to be given in all the notices that "The Purple Slipper"
was to open the New Carnival Theater and in his heart the young
advertiser put away the intention of making the fact that Mr. Vandeford
had sold Hawtry and "The Rosie Posie Girl" for "The Purple Slipper," his
most brilliant reserve story to set all of Broadway, at least, agog for
the opening of the expensive new play.
</p><p>"It puts 'The Purple Slipper' at the big end of the horn, and it's not
your fault that there is only the little end of the horn left for 'The
Rosie Posie Girl' for the time being," he explained to Mr. Vandeford.
"You see, it is a kind of double-cross that acts both ways. If it goes,
people will think it was worth your paying a big price for, and if it
fails, they'll think the 'Rosie Posie Girl' couldn't have been much if
you traded a chance on such a poor show for it."
</p><p>"Goes!" said Mr. Vandeford, but he was aware that the smart manoeuver,
which would once have delighted his soul, made him intensely weary.
</p><p>In fact, so fatigued did he feel when he left this young press schemer,
that he dropped into his bed for an hour, and had a masseur come and
pound him into condition to go to the train with good Dennis Farraday to
meet Mrs. Farraday, Mrs. and Mr. and Miss Van Tyne, who arrived at five
o'clock from big Manhattan. Mr. Farraday had had a like operation
performed upon himself, and was in such a radiant condition that Mr.
Vandeford felt badly eclipsed beside him.
</p><p>"What does it all mean about Miss Hawtry and Miss Lindsey and the show,
Van?" Mrs. Farraday questioned, with greater anxiety in her face than
she had had at any other opening night of her favorite's successful
shows. "Are we going to have a terrible time?"
</p><p>"I'm going to put you in a wheel-chair and let Denny take you up to the
north end of the board-walk and tell you all about it while I locate and
make comfortable the rest of the folks," Mr. Vandeford answered with a
deep relief at her presence in his eyes.
</p><p>"Where are my girls?" she questioned.
</p><p>"Both dead--asleep," he answered, as if deeply happy to be able to say
it of his star and his author.
</p><p>His statement was only partly true, for while Miss Adair slept the sleep
of the emotionally unanxious, Mildred Lindsey sat crouched by her
window, with her eyes looking far out over the Atlantic Ocean, waiting
for the result of Mr. Dennis Farraday's talk with his mother at the
north end of the board-walk.
</p><p>There are occasionally mothers who bear sons who can tell them all about
things, and Mrs. Farraday really enjoyed the whole story that big,
bonnie Dennis poured out to her at the sunset hour by the brink of old
ocean, Dago Italiana squatting on his heels out of hearing and basking
in inactivity, from the moment of the beefsteak episode in his and Miss
Lindsey's acquaintance up to the moment in which Miss Hawtry had
established herself in his arms on the occasion of his début in a stage
dressing-room. And even at that stage of the narration she rather
astonished Mr. Farraday, who was shamefaced enough at the telling, by
saying with soft pity in her motherly voice:
</p><p>"The poor woman. Of course she couldn't help loving you, and now she's
lost both Van and you. Now go on and tell me about Mildred."
</p><p>"She--she's the best ever," was Mr. Farraday's explicit and enlightening
answer.
</p><p>"Of course she is. I saw that the time you brought her to dinner with
me, and also that you were in love with her. She's really a rather
wonderful girl, and--and--Dennis, I'll tell you something that I never
expected to tell you--I've always wanted to be an actress. I simply
adore that Lindsey girl, and I know she'll make a great actress. Why on
earth should she want to marry you?" Which goes to show that
aristocratic Mrs. Farraday was not the ordinary mother.
</p><p>"Let's go ask her," roared big Dennis, as he embraced her in a way that
made the sympathetic and now wealthy young Dago Italiana flash his white
teeth in joy.
</p><p>And nobody can say how much the fate of "The Purple Slipper" was
affected by the fact that Rosalind went upon the stage for her first
appearance as a star, straight from the tender arms of stately,
white-haired Mrs. Farraday.
</p><p>The opening night of "The Purple Slipper," by Patricia Adair, produced
by Mr. Godfrey Vandeford, and staged by Mr. William Rooney, was a
triumph undisputed and acknowledged by a brilliant cosmopolitan audience
such as Atlantic City furnishes any play presented to it before
September the twenty-fifth, for up until that week on the board-walk of
that resort East meets West and the South joins them. The eminent author
sat in the left stage box with Mrs. Justus Farraday of New York and Mr.
and Mrs. Derick Van Tyne, and at her side was a chair into which at
times dropped Mr. Dennis Farraday, but which had been reserved for the
producer. Things had gone brilliantly from the start, from the moment
the curtain went up with polished, interesting Miss Herne manoeuvering
the frightened and substituted Betty Carrington through the opening
dialogue. A veritable gasp of joy had greeted the beautiful Mr. Gerald
Height as he entered in his colonial wig, ruffles, and velvet, and his
big eyes under their bowed brows sought out the author and smiled at her
with a genuine pledge of loyalty which no lizard could ever have given
forth as he glided richly into his archaic banter with Miss Herne.
</p><p>"He'll get 'em going, get 'em going the whole dame bunch from Harlem to
the Battery," muttered Mr. Rooney to Fido, who stood in the wings, with
his eyes glued to the much annotated prompt copy. "Now watch out for
Lindsey; she's doing forty sides of new stuff in twenty hours. Me for
the stock company to train 'em young. Let her rip, Rosalind!" And with a
nod Mr. Rooney sent his "bet" out upon the stage to make the audience
forget that they had paid their money to see Violet Hawtry and make them
glad to have paid it to see her.
</p><p>As Mildred Lindsey stepped out on the stage in all the glory of an
almost unbelievable beauty, Mr. Godfrey Vandeford, who sat with his
shoulder back of that of the author of his play, seemed to behold a
vision with his trained theatrical foresight. This slender, powerful
young woman, with the rose dusk of the prairie sun on her cheeks, the
depths of the great cañons in her dark eyes, and the breadth of the far
horizons across her broad brow seemed to him to typify the rise of order
in her profession, over which so long had ruled chaos. And as her rich
voice led the intrigued audience from one brilliant scene to another, in
which she reincarnated before their eyes a very flower of the old
Southern chivalry with dash, finish, and lucidity, he felt as if he had
done his best and now had a right to be allowed to depart in peace from
the world of tinsel and illusion. As Lindsey and Height held the
audience spell-bound while the tempted wife dueled with her might
against the tender and desperate lover, placing, with a combined art
that was as great as any he had ever witnessed, the "big scene" of "The
Purple Slipper" among the "big scenes" of the modern stage instead of in
the class of lascivious masterpieces where the night before Hawtry had
laid it, Mr. Vandeford looked down into the gray eyes of the girl who
had had it all in her blood for generations, and who had so brilliantly
given it birth, and felt a prophecy rise within him that soon the
American drama would begin to draw on the wealth of tradition which had
been piling up in a vast storage for it, and that when it did,
dramatists and actors, men and women, would rise to interpret it to a
wondering world.
</p><p>"Is it really mine?" she asked him, in proud surprise and wonder.
</p><p>"Yes, it's yours--filtered through Howard and Rooney and all the rest,
but--it--is--you," he answered. "You lost it a dozen times, but--his
own comes back to a man or a woman."
</p><p>His eyes blazed so that the long lashes lowered over the stars in hers,
and she saw the curtain fall on the last scene in a mist of tears. The
onrush of applause that raised the curtain half a dozen times was
confused in her by the pounding of Mr. Vandeford's heart back of her
shoulder and the echo in her own.
</p><p>"Fifty weeks and then some, Van," she heard the young press-agent
declare, in business-like congratulation.
</p><p>"Sure-fire hit," Mr. Rooney pronounced, as he spat on the stage floor
behind the curtain. "Rehearsals at ten to-morrow to tighten up, Fido. Me
for the hay." Miss Adair had gone back of the footlights to cast her
gratitude into his arms, and he had failed to notice her appearance in
any way at all, but had spat and gone on his autocratic way. Perhaps in
the New World of the Theater, stage-managers may be able to afford to be
human, perhaps not.
</p><p>Mr. Vandeford's supper-party to the cast of "The Purple Slipper" and the
friends from New York who had come down to see its try-out, lasted until
two o'clock in the morning, but when it was over neither the moon, which
was as full that night as Mr. Kent had become by coffee and cigars, nor
Dago Italiana had retired, and both stayed on their jobs out at the
south end of the board walk, where boards melt off into sand and ocean
and sky.
</p><p>Mr. Godfrey Vandeford had got about two thirds of the way along the
painful stretch of autobiography, with which he was inflicting agony on
himself by recounting to Miss Adair, when she raised her gray eyes to
his with the faith and reverence still at their average level, even
slightly higher, and stopped his punishment.
</p><p>"I understand exactly why people like you and Miss Hawtry don't marry
each other," she astonished him by saying in all calmness. "Mr. Height
explained it all to me the other day. Actors and actresses have
peculiar temperaments that fly together when they ought not to, and fly
apart when they ought to stay together. I know just how that is because
I feel--"
</p><p>"Hush!" commanded Mr. Vandeford, as he laid his hands on the shoulders
of his author, who was standing close to him, with the moonlight full on
her clear-cut, high-bred face, and he gave her a savage shake. "The
whole crazy bunch will have to have law and order shot into 'em or the
theatrical profession will follow horse-racing to the devil. If they
don't give up unfaith and the double-cross Broadway will open some night
and swallow them all. And here you come out of a real world and say to
me--"
</p><p>"What did you think I was going to say?" demanded Miss Adair, pressing
so close to him that it was impossible for him to administer another
shake.
</p><p>"I don't know and I don't want to hear it. I'm afraid to have you say
anything to me."
</p><p>"It was this: I was going to ask you what I would have done if you had
been married to Miss Hawtry when I got to you and we had begun to
produce our play together. It's different when men and women work
together! Standards have to be broader. How do I know that I would have
run away to--"
</p><p>"Don't, don't!" pleaded Mr. Vandeford as she crept still nearer to him
and forcibly tried to open his arms for herself. "I'm punished. I've
taught you myself! When I leave you how'll I ever know if I'm going to
find you there when I come back?"
</p><p>"Well, how'd you expect to find me--me--there if you don't take me
there?" Miss Adair pleaded as she tugged at his folded arms, with such
energy that her polished thumb-nail slightly marked his iron wrists.
</p><p>"I'm not worthy, child, I'm not worthy," Mr. Vandeford answered with
grim words, and his arms still taut against his breast.
</p><p>"You have to judge yourself with the same--same 'broad standards' I
judge you by, like you told me to use. Please open your arms!"
</p><p>"I take those broad standards away from you."
</p><p>"Jesus Christ gave them to me, only I didn't understand in Adairville."
</p><p>"God, I wish you had never left Adairville."
</p><p>"I know what there is for us to do."
</p><p>"What?"
</p><p>"I'll go back and marry you by Adairville narrow standards for better
and for worse, and then we'll have to keep 'em for ourselves when we
come back, because we did it knowing what we know, but let other people
be broad wherever they are without judging them. I'm going to drop
asleep right here on the sand if you don't open your arms."
</p><p>"Oh, good Lord, what did You make women out of?" Mr. Vandeford said in
all reverence and bewilderment, as he took the "white flame" to his
breast and drew it past her lips until it burned away all the chaff in
his soul and established itself upon its altar.
</p><p>After Mr. Vandeford had again delivered his author to the hopeful maid,
waiting up for another greenback, he met Mr. Rooney at the desk of the
hotel still on his way to "the hay."
</p><p>"Closed up with Weiner to begin rehearsing 'The Rosie Posie Girl' on
Tuesday, after we open 'The Purple Slipper' in the New Carnival. Said
Hawtry wouldn't sign up until I had signed too. She's got a hunch for
me. If you fail, their show goes in in your place; if you win, Weiner
shunts John Drew or Arliss out to one of his other theaters on the road,
and puts in 'The Rosie Posie Girl.' Good business, eh?" And Mr. Rooney
rolled his cigar from east to west and questioned Mr. Vandeford, with a
new fire for a new undertaking beginning to burn in his little black
eyes.
</p><p>"Fine," answered Mr. Vandeford, with all cordiality, and not even
thinking of his lost thousands. "It will go big, Rooney, and I'll be
glad--none gladder."
</p><p>"Sure," answered Mr. Rooney. "It's all in the business. Everybody on
Broadway is out to stab everybody else--but mostly it's paper daggers if
you take it right."
</p><p>"A tissue-paper world sewed together with tinsel thread," Mr. Vandeford
murmured, as he fell asleep with his cheek pillowed on the wrist that
Miss Adair had marked in the struggle for her own.
</p><p>A week from that night "The Purple Slipper" had its first night on
Broadway, and opened the New Carnival Theater in a blaze of glory,
publicity, and electric lights. The talented young press-agent had done
his work well, and the audience assembled was the most brilliant
possible, made up of the usual blasé critics, eager theatrical people
who were not on the boards themselves, and interested and distinguished
men and women from many outer worlds. In the box facing the one occupied
by Mrs. Justus Farraday, in a blaze of both the Farraday and Justus
jewels and prestige, and the beautiful young author of the play, with
her son Mr. Dennis Farraday, and the producer, Mr. Godfrey Vandeford,
sat Miss Violet Hawtry with Mr. Weiner, the owner of the beautiful new
theater which was opening its doors for the first time on Broadway. When
the curtain fell upon the new Lindsey star after its eighth elevation,
the Violet rushed behind the scenes and took that astonished young woman
in her arms, with the real tears of emotion, with which one genuine
artist greets another, in her great blue eyes.
</p><p>"You were wonderful, my dear, perfectly wonderful," she exclaimed. "You
see, Van, I never could have done it like that. Good luck to both of
you, and the little author--oh, there you are, my dear! All of you shake
hands with Mr. Weiner. He's so pleased that he is speechless, but he's
going to give you a big banquet on your fiftieth performance. He's
promised me."
</p><p>Which demonstration was perfectly in keeping with Miss Hawtry and
Maggie Murphy's character, and emanated from that quality within her
that a month later put "The Rosie Posie Girl" up as high and as
brilliant in electric lights as "The Purple Slipper," and kept it there
an entire year. Which goes to prove that the "tissue paper world" is yet
of heroic fibre.
</p><p>When Mr. Vandeford went to insert his author into the international
safety that evening at about the hour of midnight, he saw that his
friend the secretary was shooing a chattering party of Christian ladies,
who, as his guests, had sat in a group, fifth row center, in the New
Carnival Theater that evening, off up-stairs. With his talisman key,
which had never left his pocket since it had been presented to him, in
his hand, he paused to speak in a friendly shadow to his successful and
now truly eminent playwright.
</p><p>"You'll have to go South Thursday, and I'll follow Sunday to get that
little marriage business over in Adairville before we leave for the
Klondike. My commission has arrived from Washington, and the Secretary
of the Navy wants quick reports of the copper before the big freeze. Do
you suppose I can keep you warm in Eskimo furs and--and my heart?"
</p><p>"Yes," answered Miss Adair, with the flutter which Mr. Vandeford now
answered, without any conscious volition. "There ought to be a great
play out of the Klondike. Jack London could have done it, but--but--"
the faithful gray eyes were raised to his with the flame in their
depths.
</p><p>With a groan, but an answering flame, Mr. Vandeford replied:
</p><p>"It's a fatal drag--. Yes. Some day we'll come back and try to put
across another one!"
