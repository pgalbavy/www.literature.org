<p>IT WAS AT THE Vannis’ tent that Antonia was discovered. Hitherto she
had been looked upon more as a ward of the Harlings than as one of the
‘hired girls.’ She had lived in their house and yard and garden; her
thoughts never seemed to stray outside that little kingdom. But after
the tent came to town she began to go about with Tiny and Lena and their
friends. The Vannis often said that Antonia was the best dancer of them
all. I sometimes heard murmurs in the crowd outside the pavilion that
Mrs. Harling would soon have her hands full with that girl. The young
men began to joke with each other about ‘the Harlings’ Tony’ as they did
about ‘the Marshalls’ Anna’ or ‘the Gardeners’ Tiny.’
</p><p>Antonia talked and thought of nothing but the tent. She hummed the
dance tunes all day. When supper was late, she hurried with her dishes,
dropped and smashed them in her excitement. At the first call of the
music, she became irresponsible. If she hadn’t time to dress, she merely
flung off her apron and shot out of the kitchen door. Sometimes I went
with her; the moment the lighted tent came into view she would break
into a run, like a boy. There were always partners waiting for her; she
began to dance before she got her breath.
</p><p>Antonia’s success at the tent had its consequences. The iceman
lingered too long now, when he came into the covered porch to fill the
refrigerator. The delivery boys hung about the kitchen when they brought
the groceries. Young farmers who were in town for Saturday came tramping
through the yard to the back door to engage dances, or to invite Tony to
parties and picnics. Lena and Norwegian Anna dropped in to help her with
her work, so that she could get away early. The boys who brought her
home after the dances sometimes laughed at the back gate and wakened Mr.
Harling from his first sleep. A crisis was inevitable.
</p><p>One Saturday night Mr. Harling had gone down to the cellar for beer. As
he came up the stairs in the dark, he heard scuffling on the back porch,
and then the sound of a vigorous slap. He looked out through the side
door in time to see a pair of long legs vaulting over the picket fence.
Antonia was standing there, angry and excited. Young Harry Paine, who
was to marry his employer’s daughter on Monday, had come to the tent
with a crowd of friends and danced all evening. Afterward, he begged
Antonia to let him walk home with her. She said she supposed he was a
nice young man, as he was one of Miss Frances’s friends, and she
didn’t mind. On the back porch he tried to kiss her, and when she
protested--because he was going to be married on Monday--he caught her
and kissed her until she got one hand free and slapped him.
</p><p>Mr. Harling put his beer-bottles down on the table. ‘This is what
I’ve been expecting, Antonia. You’ve been going with girls who have
a reputation for being free and easy, and now you’ve got the same
reputation. I won’t have this and that fellow tramping about my back
yard all the time. This is the end of it, tonight. It stops, short. You
can quit going to these dances, or you can hunt another place. Think it
over.’
</p><p>The next morning when Mrs. Harling and Frances tried to reason with
Antonia, they found her agitated but determined. ‘Stop going to the
tent?’ she panted. ‘I wouldn’t think of it for a minute! My own father
couldn’t make me stop! Mr. Harling ain’t my boss outside my work. I
won’t give up my friends, either. The boys I go with are nice fellows.
I thought Mr. Paine was all right, too, because he used to come here. I
guess I gave him a red face for his wedding, all right!’ she blazed out
indignantly.
</p><p>‘You’ll have to do one thing or the other, Antonia,’ Mrs. Harling told
her decidedly. ‘I can’t go back on what Mr. Harling has said. This is
his house.’
</p><p>‘Then I’ll just leave, Mrs. Harling. Lena’s been wanting me to get a
place closer to her for a long while. Mary Svoboda’s going away from the
Cutters’ to work at the hotel, and I can have her place.’
</p><p>Mrs. Harling rose from her chair. ‘Antonia, if you go to the Cutters’ to
work, you cannot come back to this house again. You know what that man
is. It will be the ruin of you.’
</p><p>Tony snatched up the teakettle and began to pour boiling water over the
glasses, laughing excitedly. ‘Oh, I can take care of myself! I’m a lot
stronger than Cutter is. They pay four dollars there, and there’s no
children. The work’s nothing; I can have every evening, and be out a lot
in the afternoons.’
</p><p>‘I thought you liked children. Tony, what’s come over you?’
</p><p>‘I don’t know, something has.’ Antonia tossed her head and set her jaw.
‘A girl like me has got to take her good times when she can. Maybe there
won’t be any tent next year. I guess I want to have my fling, like the
other girls.’
</p><p>Mrs. Harling gave a short, harsh laugh. ‘If you go to work for the
Cutters, you’re likely to have a fling that you won’t get up from in a
hurry.’
</p><p>Frances said, when she told grandmother and me about this scene, that
every pan and plate and cup on the shelves trembled when her mother
walked out of the kitchen. Mrs. Harling declared bitterly that she
wished she had never let herself get fond of Antonia.
