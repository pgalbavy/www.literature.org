"She leaned far out on the window-sill,<br/>
And shook it forth with a royal will.

</p>
<p>
'Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,<br/>
But spare your country's flag,' she said."

</p>
</div>
<p>The black eyes of the little speaker burned with fiery indignation
as she hurled these words of defiance at a ten-quart pail of blackberries
standing in the middle of the dusty road where she had set it
when the emotion of her recital had overcome her to such a degree
that mere words were no longer effective and gestures had become
absolutely necessary. She was living it herself. What did it matter
that there was no rebel army confronting her, what did it matter
that the town of Frederick lay hundreds of miles away, what did
it matter that she was merely a slip of a girl living fifty years
after the terrible scenes of war which inspired the words she
was reciting?</p>

<p>The whole picture lay as vividly before her as if she had been
Dame Barbara herself, and she entered into the spirit of the production
with such vim that her actual surroundings were forgotten. Her
thin, peaked face, browned by sun and wind, was glorified with
patriotism, and her voice rang sharp with the intensity of feeling.
Having no flag to shake in the face of the approaching enemy,
she pulled a mullein stalk growing among the tall grass and flaunted
it so vigorously that in leaning over her imaginary window-sill
she lost her balance and was nearly capsized into her pail of
luscious berries.</p>

<p>A rude laugh interrupted her and she was brought to earth with
a suddenness that left her breathless and crimson with embarrassment
beside the road, digging her bare toes into the gray dust and
waiting for the jeers she knew were to follow.</p>

<p>Then her face changed and the defiance flashed back into the
big black eyes. Her tormentor was not the person she had evidently
expected it to be, and her courage rose accordingly. Again the
boy laughed insolently and the girl's fists clenched involuntarily
as she looked up into the sneering face above her and realized
that after all she could do him no harm for he was perched in
the branches of a tree just out of reach over her head. His bare
legs dangled tantalizingly among the green leaves, and all she
could do to show her fierce hatred was to grimace at him. The
effect was most startling. Her tormentor lost his hold on the
upper bough and slid from his seat. There was a lively scratching
and clawing among the branches; while below, the black-eyed girl
held her breath in expectancy. Oh, if only he would tumble! But
he did not fall, and her expression of jubilation changed to disappointment.</p>

<p>Carefully he righted himself on the limb where he had landed,
and, peering down at the child in the road, tauntingly cried,</p>

<p>"Don't we think we are smart, Tabby Catt, Tabby Catt? Don't we
think we are smart?"</p>

<p>The girl's lips curved scornfully, but her hard fists tightened
until her knuckles stood out like white balls.</p>

<p>"How's Thomas Catt today?" continued the boy, swinging his feet
dangerously near the tattered sunbonnet, which half concealed
the angry little face below.</p>

<p>Still she deigned no reply, though her eyes blazed furiously
and her breath came quick and short. She took a step nearer the
tree and he cautiously drew his feet up to the branch on which
he sat; but apparently she did not notice this move, as she stood
measuring the distance from the ground to the limbs above and
wondering whether or not she could reach him and give him the
drubbing he deserved before he had a chance to escape or call
for help. She could climb like a squirrel and run like a deer,
but in the pasture beyond this fringe of trees was the boy's big
brother, and she had no desire to meet him, having once had a
taste of his great whip.</p>

<p>Perhaps the boy in the tree guessed her thoughts, for once more
he lowered his feet and kicked viciously at her as he chanted:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Tabby Catt, Tabby Catt,<br/>
&nbsp;Drink some milk and make you fat,<br/>
&nbsp;Skinny, scrawny Tabby Catt."

</p>
</div>
<p>The faded calico bonnet caught on his toes and he tossed it high
in the air, letting it fall far out in the dust of the road. Never
pausing to see what was the fate of her possessions, the child
let out one scream of animal rage, and with a tiger-like spring
caught the feet of her enemy and jerked the coward off his perch.</p>

<p>Taken off his guard, he fell heavily into the road, crushing
her beneath him, and raising such a cloud of dust that both were
nearly smothered; but with a dexterous twist she freed herself,
and, unconscious of the dust, the boy's screams or the sound of
answering shouts in the pasture nearby, she fell to pummelling
her helpless victim with relentless fists, all the while screaming
at the top of her voice,</p>

<p>"I am a Tabby Catt, am I? I am scrawny and skinny, am I? Well,
you're a coward, a good-for-nothing coward, and so is your big
brother. He wouldn't dare fight Tom, and you wouldn't dare say
such things to me if Tom was anywhere near. You're a bully, an
overgrown baby, a 'fraid-cat! Yes, that's what you are! <em>I</em>
may be a Tabby Catt, but I'm <em>not</em> a 'fraid-cat. I may
be skinny and scrawny now, but I reckon you will be, too, when
I get through with you, Joe Pomeroy! You're the sneakin'est sneak
that ever lived&mdash;except your brother. 'Fraid-cat, sneak, sneak,
sneak, s-n-e-a-k&mdash;"</p>

<p>Words failed her. What could she say mean enough to express her
contempt for the howling coward almost twice her size pinned under
her knees, making no attempt to defend himself against the rain
of blows falling wherever the avenging fists could strike?</p>

<p>Suddenly she felt herself snatched from the back of her victim,
held high in the air so her feet did not touch the ground, and
shaken to and fro as a terrier shakes a rat. She twisted and turned
and writhed and squirmed to free herself, thinking this must be
the big brother punishing her for the drubbing she had given hapless
Joe, and expecting any instant to feel the lash of his heavy herder's
whip. But no whip struck her, and with one great tug she broke
loose from the hand that gripped her shoulder, and confronted&mdash;not
Sneed Pomeroy, the bully, but a tall, swarthy-faced man with a
long beard and snapping black eyes, very much like her own, had
she taken the time to notice it, who held her transfixed for a
moment with his angry gaze. Amazed to find Joe's rescuer&mdash;for
such he appeared to her&mdash;some one other than the big brother Sneed,
and angered at the vigorous shaking he had given her, the child
found vent for her outraged feelings in a horrible grimace at
the stalwart man in front of her. With an exclamation of anger
the stranger raised his hand as if to strike the girl, but she
dodged the blow, and screamed in disdainful defiance:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Slap, if you dare, you old gray head,<br/>
&nbsp;I'll scratch like a&mdash;cat&mdash;till you'll wish you were dead."

</p>
</div>
<p>She hesitated a moment before choosing that word, and as it fell
from her lips, she glanced apprehensively at the blubbering Joe
still lying in the dust, and saw for the first time that this
rescuer, whoever he might be, was evidently unknown to Joe, for
the coward's bloody face was even more scared than when she had
been pounding it, and he looked as if he, too, expected to receive
some punishment from the hands of the mysterious stranger.</p>

<p>"Tabitha Catt!"</p>

<p>She whirled toward the man in frightened silence, and her clenched
hands dropped nerveless at her side. It was her father! What a
change the heavy beard made in his appearance; and then besides,
it was almost a year since she had seen him. No wonder she had
failed to recognize him in her anger. It would have taken more
than one glance had she met him under ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>"Put on your bonnet and march home. We will settle matters there."</p>

<p>His words sounded so ominous that she hastily did as he bid,
wondering dully whether at last her day of reckoning had come.</p>

<p>"Here, boy, take your berries and be off, but if I ever catch
you hec&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Those are my berries," Tabitha found courage to say, suddenly
remembering the pail heaped full of the fruit she had toiled all
the morning to pick; and the man, glancing down at her bony hands,
scratched and scarred by blackberry thorns, thrust the heavy pail
into her arms and without a word followed her in the dusty march
toward the house a quarter of a mile distant; nor did he once
offer to help her with her load, though the way was rough, the
day intensely hot, and the weight too much for the slender shoulders
of the child. Once she stubbed her toe, and he pulled her roughly
to her feet, but released his hold on her arm when she fixed her
black eyes full of scorn and anger upon his face; and a grim smile
played an instant about his lips, but was gone again before the
child could see it.</p>

<p>The house was reached at last, and with a sigh of relief Tabitha
dropped her burden in the doorway and sank down beside it.</p>

<p>At the sound of steps on the gravel walk, a fussy, fidgety little
woman appeared from the room beyond, and stopped in astonishment
at sight of the giant coming up the steps. Before she had a chance
to express her surprise, however, he spoke, addressing the panting
child fanning herself with her bonnet:</p>

<p>"Close that screen. Can't you see those flies coming in? Go to
my room, I want to have an understanding with you. Maria, Tabitha
isn't to have a taste of those berries. I just found her in the
middle of the road down here fighting with a boy, like the rowdy
she is."</p>

<p>Accustomed to obey this stern father, Tabitha had withdrawn into
the house, and started for the room where punishment awaited her.
At his command in regard to the berries, however, she paused;
then turned to where the pail stood just inside the screen, seized
it, and before either of the two spectators understood what she
was about, she flung bucket, berries and all into the dooryard
and ground the shining fruit into the sand with her bare feet.</p>

<p>"There, Manx Catt," she exclaimed, "I reckon you won't have a
taste of them either!"</p>

<p>A gasp of dismay escaped the frightened woman, but again the
grim smile flitted across the face of the father, though he looked
like a thunder cloud as he roared at the child, "Go straight to
your room and to bed! You shall not have a thing to eat today!"</p>

<p>With her feet stained a dirty purple, Tabitha marched into the
house and upstairs, rushed to her little bed in the corner, and
threw herself full length on the counterpane, regardless of the
fact that drops of berry juice still dripped from her brown legs.
For fully ten minutes she lay there, fighting back the angry tears
and battling with the fierce rage against her father.</p>

<p>"I hate him, I hate him!" she told herself over and over again.
"It's bad enough to have him name me Tabitha without his acting
so hateful every time he comes home. I wish he would go off to
the mines and stay forever. He might take Aunt Maria, too, though
she ain't so bad. We could get along with her all right; sometimes
she is splendid, even if she is so fussy. Oh, dear, why can't
we have a nice mother like other children have? I reckon ours
wouldn't have died if she had known Aunt Maria would have to take
care of us and Dad would be so horrid."</p>

<p>Her list of woes was fast increasing, and the tears were very
near the bubbling-over point, when she heard heavy steps on the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Oh, my sakes! that's Dad. Wonder if he will lick me this time.
I 'spect he will some day, and Tom says he licks awful hard. Wonder
if he will use a whip like sneaky Sneed Pomeroy. Wisht I was as
big as Tom; he don't get licked any more, he's too big. Dad told
me to go to bed and I ain't undressed. Maybe it's just as well
if he's going to lick me."</p>

<p>The steps had reached the upper floor now, and she cowered in
a trembling heap in the middle of her bed waiting for the door
to open and let her father enter. But they continued down the
hall without so much as pausing before her door, and now as her
heart began to beat normally again, she heard Aunt Maria's voice
saying, "There's a dreadful clutter to move if we take everything.
Some of those boxes we brought from Dover have never been opened
though we've been here two years now. Doesn't seem as if we had
to take all that truck with us wherever we go. There hasn't been
a thing in the stuff that we've needed."</p>

<p>"Then don't take it," cut in the man's heavy voice. "Where is
it?"</p>

<p>Cautiously creeping off the bed, Tabitha pressed her ear to the
keyhole to catch the rest of this interesting conversation, but
as she listened, her face paled and a rebellious look came into
the expressive black eyes.</p>

<p>So they were going to move away! Where would they go this time?
It seemed to her that moving was all they ever did. Not that she
minded the moving part of it&mdash;that was fun&mdash;but&mdash;. Here the tears
came in earnest. It was her dreadful name that she minded. It
didn't make any difference where they went, everyone made fun
of her name, and folks no sooner got used to seeing her odd little
figure and hearing her still odder name than they moved to some
other town, and the same thing had to be lived over. Oh, it was
too bad!</p>

<p>All the hot afternoon father and aunt busied themselves in the
adjoining rooms, tearing open boxes, sorting, re-packing, and
bundling things around generally, until finally the noise became
so great that only an occasional word of the conversation could
be heard by the little listener at the keyhole. As the day waned,
however, and the supper hour approached, both workers ceased their
pounding and went downstairs, leaving Tabitha alone with her tearful
reflections in the gathering dusk. Here Tom found her, still huddled
in a heap beside the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom," she greeted him, "I thought you would never come.
What made you so late? Did you know Dad had come home again? Haven't
you something in your pocket to eat? I'm hungry as a wolf."</p>

<p>"Hush!" he said, slipping inside the door and closing it softly
behind him. "Dad would be awfully mad if he knew I was here. I
just got home. Had an errand across the pond after the store was
closed. Here's a biscuit and some cheese. Why aren't you in bed?
Aunt Maria said Dad sent you there at noon." As he spoke, the
boy lifted the little sister to her feet, brushed out her crumpled
dress, smoothed back her tangled hair and slipped the biscuit
saved from his own supper into her eager hands.</p>

<p>"I did go to bed," mumbled Tabitha, with her mouth full of bread.</p>

<p>"You aren't undressed."</p>

<p>"Dad didn't say I had to undress, and he didn't say I had to
<em>stay</em> in bed, either."</p>

<p>Tom grinned at her understanding of the law, but the darkness
hid his face, so his amusement was lost to the small sister eating
so ravenously.</p>

<p>"Did he lick you, Puss?"</p>

<p>"Nope. I thought he was going to, for he looked right mad, but
I reckon I was so mad it wouldn't have hurt much."</p>

<p>"But it does hurt to have him whip. At least, it used to hurt
me. Do be careful, Puss. I don't want him to begin whipping you.
How did you make him so mad?"</p>

<p>The child briefly recounted the story of the morning's tribulations
between bites of biscuit and cheese, growing so angry over her
recital that the flood gates were opened again and she sobbed
aloud in her tempest of grief.</p>

<p>"It's all on account of my horrid name," she told him. "I just
can't be good when folks say such mean things. Joe Pomeroy is
a sneak anyway, and I've been itching to lick him for a long,
long time&mdash;ever since Sneed hit me with the whip he uses to drive
the cows with."</p>

<p>"Did Sneed hit you with a whip?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, Tom, I never meant to tell you that! Now you'll go
and fight him and he will hurt you, 'cause he's so much bigger
than you are, and then Dad will whale you for fighting. Thrash
Joe, but don't tackle Sneed. Oh, please!"</p>

<p>Tom laughed ironically. "Hm, what satisfaction would it be to
me to thrash someone that <em>you</em> have licked, Puss?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Please, Tom, don't touch Sneed," she begged, crying harder than
ever; and to still her sobs, he promised, though in his heart
he vowed vengeance.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to go blackberrying without me?" he asked
to divert her attention from her anxiety over him. "I thought
you wanted me to go with you."</p>

<p>"Why, you're so busy at the store that we don't have time to
get more than a handful at night when you can go, and the bushes
were just loaded with them just below Pomeroy's pasture. I never
thought about Joe's being there to tease me. I did want the berries
so much, for Aunt Maria said she would make some jelly and some
jam if I would pick the berries. She won't gather 'em 'cause the
thorns tear her hands so. I got the pail full&mdash;heaped up so they
kept tumbling off&mdash;and now they are all spoiled and I've scratched
my hands to pieces all for nothing."</p>

<p>Tom expected a fresh wail would follow this statement, for though
Tabitha was not ordinarily a cry-baby, the day of trials had been
too much for her; but he was surprised when after a moment of
silence in which he was vainly trying to think of something consoling
to say, she remarked, "Well, I don't know's I care much about
the berries, 'cause we're going to move, and I s'pose if we had
a lot of jelly put up, Dad would say it wasn't any use to take
it with us, and we would have to leave it along with the rest
of the truck they've been sorting out today."</p>

<p>"Move?" the boy interrupted, as the realization of what she was
saying dawned upon him. "Who says we're going to move? What do
you mean? They never told me!"</p>

<p>"I heard Dad tell Aunt Maria we would leave the last of the week
for the place where he has just come from, and they have been
packing all the afternoon."</p>

<p>Tom was silent and in the darkness Tabitha could not see his
face, but she seemed to understand how he felt about it, and after
a moment she slipped a thorn-scratched little hand into his, as
she said,</p>

<p>"You don't like it, do you, Tommy? I'm sorry, too. I wanted to
stay here. The people who have moved in the big red house by the
pond have two of the nicest children. They are cousins and have
the prettiest names &mdash;Rosalie Meywood and Rosslyn Fennimore&mdash;and
they are almost my age. I hated to tell them my name, but they
didn't laugh a bit, Tom. They didn't even <em>look</em> queer
at each other, and Rosslyn said they had a kitten they called
Tabby and it was the smartest cat they ever saw. They have taught
it tricks and Rosalie invited me over to see it. I met them down
in the blackberry patch. They were picking just for fun and they
helped me a little&mdash;not much, 'cause they were so slow. Neither
of them knows how to pick berries and they took only those out
in sight, while the very best ones are most always way in under
the vines. We are all in the same classes in school and we planned
such nice times together when lessons begin again. I never get
to knowing any nice people but we move away. Do you s'pose we
will ever have any friends, Tom?"</p>

<p>Tom's thoughts were very busy, and he only half heard the child's
lively chatter. In the dim long ago, when he was only six years
old, one morning a white-aproned woman with a gentle face had
called him to her and led him into a room where lay his own dear
mother with a little white bundle on her arm, and when the covers
were turned down he had looked into a tiny, red, wrinkled face
with blinking, black eyes and was told that this was a baby sister
come to be a playmate for him. Then the nurse went away and left
them for a little while and his mother talked to him in her soft
voice that he could remember best in the little lullaby she used
to sing to him:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I'm tired now, and sleepy, too,<br/>
&nbsp;Come put me in my little bed."

</p>
</div>
<p>She had laid the baby's little fisting hands into his and told
him that he must always take good care of little sister. He never
saw the mother again, but after days of hushed voices and light
steps in the big house, Aunt Maria had come to take care of them,
and they moved away to another town.</p>

<p>The baby lived and had grown from year to year until she was
now past eight years old, and he had tried his best to take care
of her. But she had never known a mother's love nor a father's.
Oh yes, the father was living. Tom could remember the tall, dark
man having once seized him in his arms and pressed passionate
kisses upon his lips, but he had never seen him caress the little
helpless bundle the mother had left when the angels carried her
away. Sometimes it seemed as if he could faintly recall having
heard the father say bitterly to that unconscious babe, "You have
killed your mother." And then it seemed as if a woman's voice
answered him accusingly, "You killed her yourself when you named
the child Tabitha." Tom was fourteen years old now, but some of
these memories were so dim that he could not be sure they were
really memories and not dreams that had come to him in the night
and clung, as so often such fancies do.</p>

<p>There had been no one to ask, for Aunt Maria had not come until
later, and even then, she did not talk to the children very much,
so he had grown accustomed to thinking of these things just to
himself. Tabitha was too young to be made his confidante in such
matters; indeed, he could never tell her some things. They would
only make her hate the austere father more than ever. So he sighed.
This was the fifth time they had moved from one town to another
since the mother had died, and each place was worse than the last.
No sooner were they well established in one city than the restless
spirit seized the father and they moved again. How would it end?</p>

<p>"Do you, Tom? This is the third time I have asked you that."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Puss. I was thinking about something else just then.
What is it?"</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose we will ever have any friends? Rosalie says next
week three of her little friends where they used to live are coming
to stay with her until school begins in September; and when she
asked me if I ever had any friends come to visit me, I had to
tell her I never had any friends. She seemed ever so surprised,
and I did want to stay in one place long enough to have some friends.
But I s'pose it is my name that keeps folks from being friends
with me. No one would want to say, 'My chum's name is Tabitha
Catt.' Would they? Everybody would laugh and maybe they would
sing:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'Tabby Catt, Tabby Catt,<br/>
Drink some milk and make you fat,<br/>
Skinny, scrawny Tabby Catt.'

</p>
</div>
<p>Wouldn't that make the friend feel awful? Am I very skinny, Tom?"</p>

<p>Poor Tom! How could he answer the avalanche of questions? At
fourteen one is not very wise, but Tom squeezed the rough hand
still holding his, and answered hopefully, "Some day we will have
some friends, Pussy. And some day when I get big and can work
for you, we will settle down and live in one town, and people
will come to see us, and they won't care anything about our names."</p>

<p>Something in his tone made Tabitha say questioningly, "Do you
still mind your name, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Not as much as I used to, Puss. Now you must go to bed. It's
getting late and pretty soon Dad and Aunt Maria will be coming
upstairs. Good-night." With another gentle squeeze of her hand
he was gone.</p>
