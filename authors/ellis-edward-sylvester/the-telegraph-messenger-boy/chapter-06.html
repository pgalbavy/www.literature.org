<p>There is a fascination in the presence of danger which we all
feel. The news of the dreadful disaster spread with astonishing
rapidity, and when I reached the river-side it seemed as if all
Damietta were there.</p>

<p>The lamps twinkled in the hands of innumerable men moving hither
and thither in that restless manner which showed how deep their
feelings were. People were talking in guarded voices, as if the
shadow of an awful danger impended over them, and the wildest
rumors, as is the case at such times, were afloat. It was said
that six, eight, and a dozen persons had gone down with the bridge
and were irrecoverably lost. Other structures above us were carried
away (though no one stopped to explain how the tidings had reached
ahead of the flood itself), and it was asserted that not a span
would be left on the stream at daybreak.</p>

<p>The flickering lanterns gave a glimpse of the scene which rendered
it more impressive than if viewed under the glare of midday. Some
daring ones ventured out to the first abutment despite the danger,
and we saw the glare of their lanterns on the rushing, muddy water
and the immense blocks of ice. Some of the latter would impinge
against the stone abutment with a prodigious grinding crash, spin
around several times, and then mount up from the water, crowded
by others behind, as though it was about to climb over the massive
stone. Then it would tumble back with a splash and swiftly sweep
out of sight in the darkness.</p>

<p>Again, trees, with their bushy tops tossing above the surface,
glided by as if caught in a rushing mill-race, and a grotesque
character was given to the whole scene by the sudden crowing of
some cocks, which must have been frightened by the twinkling lights
so near them.</p>

<p>Few in Damietta went to bed that night. There was a continual
walking to and fro, as people are seen to do when some great calamity
is about to break upon them. Several mounted horses and rode down
the river-bank for miles, in the weak hope of picking up tidings
of the lost ones. No one could be found who knew the lady and
child in the carriage which came upon the bridge from the other
side. There were innumerable guesses as to their identity, but
they were guesses and nothing more. No doubt was entertained that
when communication could be opened with Moorestown on the morrow,
we would learn who they were.</p>

<p>I stayed at the river-side for an hour, weighed down by the greatest
grief of my life. I was anxious to do something, but there was
absolutely nothing for me to do. Ben was gone, and his friends
could not begin an intelligent search for him before the morrow.</p>

<p>I turned on my heel to go home, when a shout went up that the
span on the other side of the center was going. There could be
no doubt that the splintering crash and the grinding swirl of
waters and ice were caused by the destruction of that span which
dissolved into nothingness almost in a moment.</p>

<p>This started the cry that the timbers nearest us were breaking
up.</p>

<p>Those who were on it made a rush for shore, which was not reached
a minute too soon. The entire span suddenly lifted up and was
"snuffed out" so promptly that the wonder was how it had withstood
the flood so long.</p>

<p>This occurrence struck me as decisive of the fate of my young
friend Ben Mayberry. It gave me an appreciation of the tremendous
irresistibility of the freshet, which must have ended the lives
of the hapless party almost on the instant. The bravest swimmer
would be absolutely helpless in the grasp of such a terrific current,
and in a night of pitchy darkness would be unable to make the
first intelligent effort to save himself.</p>

<p>At last I went home through the drizzling rain, as miserable
a mortal as one could imagine. When I reached the house I was
glad to find that my family were still asleep. It would be time
enough for them to learn of my affliction and the public disaster
on the coming morrow.</p>

<p>The pattering of the rain on the roof accorded with my feeling
of desolation, and I lay awake until almost daylight, listening,
wretched, dismal, and utterly despairing.</p>

<p>I slept unusually late, and I was glad, when I went down to my
breakfast, to learn that some kind neighbor had told my family
all I knew, and indeed, a little more. The river rose steadily
until daylight, by which time it was two feet above the abutments,
and not a vestige of the bridge remained.</p>

<p>But the water had reached its highest point, for, after remaining
stationary an hour, it had begun to fall, and was now a couple
of inches lower than "high-water mark."</p>

<p>There were two things which I dreaded&mdash;the sight of the furious
river, and to meet the sad, white face of Ben Mayberry's mother.
I felt that I could give her no word of comfort, for I needed
it almost as much as did she. She must have abandoned all hope
by this time, and her loss was enough to crush life itself from
her.</p>

<p>When walking along the street I found that everyone was talking
about the unexampled flood. It had overflowed the lower part of
the city, and people were making their way through the streets
in boats. Scores of families were made homeless, and the sights
were curious enough to draw multitudes thither.</p>

<p>I kept away from every point where I could catch so much as a
glimpse of the freshet.</p>

<p>"You have robbed me of the brightest and best boy I ever knew,"
I muttered, in bitterness of spirit; "he was one whom I loved
as if he were a son."</p>

<p>The shadow of death seemed to rest on the office when I reached
it. The loss of Ben Mayberry was a personal affliction to everyone
there. Only the most necessary words were spoken, and the sighing,
which could be heard at all times, came from the heart.</p>

<p>I went to my desk in a mechanical way, and had just placed my
hand on the instrument, when I was thrilled by a call which I
would have recognized among a thousand. Others heard and identified
it also, and held their breath. The next instant this message
reached me:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Dear Mr. Melville<br/>
&mdash;Tell mother I am all right, but in<br/>
need of dry clothing.

</p>
<p>
"Ben Mayberry."
