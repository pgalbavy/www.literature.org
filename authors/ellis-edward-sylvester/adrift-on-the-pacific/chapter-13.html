<p>Little Inez Hawthorne was overrunning with delight at the prospect
of a romp on shore, after having been confined so long in the
cramped quarters of the schooner, and she was darting hither and
thither, eager to start upon her frolic.</p>

<p>"I say, captain," said Hyde Brazzier, bowing profoundly and with
great humility, "we be greatly surprised by what you tell us about
the pearls, and we are very much obliged for your kindness, which
the same is a great deal more than we expected; but it has set
us all topsy-turvy, as we may say. If it's all the same, we would
like to go and take a look at that same pearl-oyster bed, if it
isn't inconvenient."</p>

<p>The captain and mate both understood the meaning of this, for
it showed only too clearly how impatient the men were to commit
the crime which they had in mind. Still, there was no excuse for
refusal, and the officers were anxious enough to see the place
for themselves. Each had his revolver carefully shoved into his
pocket, and each knew that the six chambers were fully charged,
when they sprang over the vessel's side and started toward the
northernmost part of the island. The captain and mate led the
way, for they were sure they were in no personal danger so long
as the oyster-bed remained undiscovered.</p>

<p>The fringe of coral trees was quite broad, but, as the little
party made their way through them, they could catch the gleam
of the water on each side, while the roar and boom of the breakers
never ceased.</p>

<p>The sun seemed to linger in the horizon to their left, as if
to guide them in the search they were making.</p>

<p>As they advanced, all observed that the outer rim of this fringe
was very irregular, as if it had been broken up and changed by
the action of fierce tempests for many decades. This peculiarity,
if such it may be termed, left many places where the ocean was
as calm as within the atoll, and it was in one of these that the
oyster-bed for which they were searching was to be found.</p>

<p>Mate and captain advanced quite spiritedly for some distance,
until they were close to the northernmost portion, when they hesitated,
slackened their gait, looked to the right and left, conferred
in low tones, and then the captain suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"This looks like the spot!"</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when the two men dashed
down the slight slope, ran a short distance, and then abruptly
halted close to the water's edge, at a point where the sea was
locked in so that it was only slightly disturbed by the ordinary
swell. Close behind them were Redvignez and Brazzier, while Pomp
brought up the rear. The three men exchanged only a word or two
while following, and those were heard by the leaders, because
they were of no significance, but it is safe to conclude they
did a great deal of thinking.</p>

<p>The five grouped themselves along the water, standing side by
side and peering down into the depths before them. This perhaps
averaged three fathoms, and the water itself was as clear as crystal,
without even the tinge of green generally seen in the ocean. The
bottom was quite even and flat, resting upon a substratum of coral.
The glinting rays of the sun helped, so that a marble could have
been distinguished many fathoms down. And looking downward, the
quintette saw the bottom strewn with oysters of unusual size,
lying so close together that in many places they seemed to touch
each other.</p>

<p>For a full minute the five stood motionless and speechless. It
was Pomp who was the first to recover his voice:</p>

<p>"My gracious! am dem 'isters full of pearls?"</p>

<p>"That can only be told by examination," was the quiet reply of
Mr. Storms.</p>

<p>"Dat's ruther deep to dive down, an' how 'bout sharks?"</p>

<p>The mate smiled.</p>

<p>"We thought of all that before we left home, Pomp."</p>

<p>"Well, what good did all de thinkin' do? Dat won't drive away
de shark, dat would as lief bite a man in two as to swaller a
fish."</p>

<p>"If you and Redvig will return to the vessel and get that coat
of mail on deck, I will agree to go down there and take all the
risks."</p>

<p>The three mutineers, as they may be called, exchanged glances,
but said nothing. The captain and mate noted this telegraphy of
the eyes, and they, too, were silent, but it was a little test
which they had determined upon before leaving the <em>Coral</em>,
lying some distance away, safely moored close inshore. Evidently
the three could think of no valid excuse, and Brazzier said, in
a low voice, which was heard by all:</p>

<p>"Go, men, and hurry back."</p>

<p>Pomp started off at once, Redvignez following close behind him.
The mate and captain saw they were speaking together; but, of
course, it could only be conjectured what they were talking about.</p>

<p>The three who remained behind were in an embarrassing situation,
for there could be no doubt that Brazzier, the leader in the plot,
had had his suspicions aroused by this little incident, and it
was hard work for him to conceal a certain uneasiness at the thought
that he had lost the confidence of the two officers of the <em>Coral</em>.</p>

<p>With a view of strengthening his position, Captain Bergen took
out his revolver, looked at it in an inquiring way, and then shoved
it back into his hip-pocket. Abe Storms did precisely the same
thing, excepting that he perhaps made a little more display about
it.</p>

<p>Not one of the three as yet had spoken a word; but Brazzier,
as if to conceal his uneasiness, advanced to the edge of the water
and peered down into the crystal depths at the supposed wealth
which lay scattered over the bottom, awaiting the hour when some
one should draw it forth from the hiding-place it had occupied
for so many years.</p>

<p>"If they've got pearls in 'em," observed Brazzier, "it'll make
a good haul for us."</p>

<p>"There is reason to think so," replied the captain, holding his
peace, for he began to suspect that too much deference had already
been paid to the crew.</p>

<p>Since Pomp and Redvignez were making good time, they soon reappeared,
bearing between them the coat of armor which Abe Storms had constructed
before leaving his New England home. This, it may be said, was
an invention peculiarly his own, containing some conveniences
not generally attributed to diving-bells or armor, and which,
if they withstood the test to which they were sure to be subjected,
would be a great step forward in the rapid improvements that have
been made in submarine armor during the last few years. A superficial
examination would not discover anything out of the usual order
in the make of the armor, with its bulging glass eyes and general
resemblance to the coats of mail such as were used by the crusaders
and knights of the middle ages. There were the two pipes, one
of which went in at the top of the helmet, as if the man were
going to breathe through the crown of his head, while the other
was adjusted so as to come nearer the front of the face. One of
these was for the admission of fresh air, and the other for the
expulsion of that which was exhaled. Besides this, there was the
rope, fastened around the waist of the diver, to assist him to
the surface should a sudden necessity arise. But, without going
into any detailed description, we may say that the ingenious New
Englander had so constructed it that he required the assistance
of no second person at any portion of the work.</p>

<p>Storms immediately began adjusting the apparatus, the others
standing off and looking on, for he had declined their proffers
of service. The armor had never been tested, and the man might
well pause, now that he was going to stake his life upon the issue,
as may be said.</p>

<p>But it was not that fact which caused the mate the most uneasiness,
for his confidence in his own invention was so strong that he
would not have hesitated a moment to trust himself in water of
twice the depth. Indeed, the pearls were so near at hand that
a very ordinary diver would have found no difficulty in bringing
them up without the help of any armor at all&mdash;the latter being
required by other considerations.</p>

<p>"Now, all I want done is to allow the two upper ends of the pipes
to be kept clear," said Storms, when he had adjusted the "harness"
about him. "I will do the breathing for myself, provided I am
not interfered with."</p>

<p>The two ends were secured among the coral in such a way that
there was no danger of their being drawn in by any action of the
armor itself, and then Storms, taking an immense sheath-knife
in his hand, promptly stepped off from the shore, and as promptly
sank under water.</p>

<p>It was a singular sight the four companions whom he left behind
saw, when they approached to the edge of the water and looked
over.</p>

<p>The mate, incased in his armor, looked like some huge, curiously-shaped
shellfish or monster, whose weight was such that he went as straight
down as an arrow, and, a few seconds later, was seen bent over
and moving about the bottom, loosening up the oysters.</p>

<p>This first venture of Storms' was more in the nature of an experiment
or preliminary reconnoissance. He wished to find how the land
lay, as the expression goes. If everything should prove to be
in good shape, he would venture down again, with a basket, and
the real work of gathering the pearl-oysters would begin.</p>

<p>As we have intimated, Abe Storms felt no misgivings concerning
his armor when he moved off from solid land and was submerged
in the edge of the Pacific, for he had constructed so many contrivances
and machines that he had learned to understand fully what they
would do before they were put to work. He carried the enormous
sheath-knife in his right hand, and when his feet lightly touched
the shells on the bottom, he began turning them over with the
point of his knife. The depth of the water being so moderate,
he found no difficulty in breathing, and indeed the conditions
were such that whoever chose to collect the oysters in this armor
was not likely to experience the slightest difficulty.</p>

<p>Down where he was at work the water seemed to be of a light-yellowish
tint, caused by the refraction of the sunlight as it made its
way to him. He noticed the mild glow, which, of course, would
steadily diminish as the sun went down, when all at once it was
eclipsed so suddenly by a dark shadow that he instantly suspected
the true cause.</p>

<p>Looking upward, he saw an immense shark, certainly a dozen feet
in length, that had halted and was evidently surveying with some
curiosity this intruder upon his domains.</p>

<p>The man-eater being directly over the diver, was not in the best
position to use his fearful jaws with effect, but he was evidently
reconnoitering with a view to hostilities. Abe observed that this
shadowy figure was motionless, its fins slightly moving back and
forth as if it were using them like a balancing-pole, to maintain
itself motionless in position, and he marked the horridly-shaped
mouth which yawned over his head. Reaching upward with his long-bladed
knife, he touched it against the white belly of the monster, and
then gave it a strong push.</p>

<p>It was so keen and sharp that it entered deep into the yielding
flesh and inflicted a severe wound. Just then the gigantic man-eater
suspected he had committed a blunder, and with a lightning-like
whirl of his huge body, he dashed out to sea, leaving a crimson
trail after him.</p>

<p>Indeed, his charge was so sudden that the huge knife was wrenched
from the grasp of Abe Storms, and he was drawn forward off his
balance. Had it been in the open air, he would have been hurled
to the ground with great force. But he managed to recover himself,
and caught a shadowy glimpse of the great shark darting off, as
the knife dropped from the wound and sank to the bottom. Not wishing
to lose the valuable weapon, Storms walked forward, and seeing
it lying on the bottom, at a point which seemed to be the edge
of the oyster-bed, he stooped over and recovered it.</p>

<p>He had now been down a considerable while, and muttered:</p>

<p>"The captain promised to signal me if trouble came, and he hasn't
done so. But, for all that, I don't believe it will be safe for
me to stay down here much longer. I may as well&#11834;"</p>

<p>The sentence was never finished, for it received a startling
interruption. The rubber pipes by which he breathed were suddenly
closed, and Abe Storms knew it had been done purposely by some
one above.</p>
