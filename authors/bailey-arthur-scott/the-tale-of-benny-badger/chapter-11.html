<p>Though Benny Badger never cared much for foxes, he was willing, usually,
to stop and talk with one of that family--provided he wasn't too busy
digging to take the time for gossip.
</p>
<p>There was one fox who often strolled about the neighborhood. And though
Benny had many a chat with this gentleman, somehow Benny never learned
much from him.
</p><p>He was so sly that he let Benny do most of the talking, while he
listened. And when he did say anything, he preferred to ask questions.
</p><p>In time Benny Badger noticed that his chats with Mr. Fox were very
one-sided. And he made up his mind at last that when he next met that
crafty fellow he would ask him plenty of questions. He would make him
talk, or he would know the reason why.
</p><p>It happened that early on the following morning, when he was hunting for
Ground Squirrel's holes, he found himself face to face with Mr. Fox. And
Benny noticed that Mr. Fox was himself looking with great interest at a
fresh Ground Squirrel's hole. "Hullo!" Benny Badger exclaimed. "I hope
you haven't come here after Ground Squirrels."
</p><p>Mr. Fox looked much surprised.
</p><p>"No, indeed!" he said. "I'm only hunting for birds' eggs."
</p><p>"Birds' eggs!" Benny Badger repeated. "Have you found any?"
</p><p>Mr. Fox squirmed a bit. He did not like to answer questions.
</p><p>"Have you found any eggs?" Benny asked him again.
</p><p>"A few!" Mr. Fox replied.
</p><p>"Where?" Benny inquired.
</p><p>"Oh, in different places," said Mr. Fox. And he began to talk about the
weather--how dry it was, and how much the country needed rain.
</p><p>But Benny Badger was not to be fooled so easily.
</p><p>"You haven't really answered my question," Benny reminded Mr. Fox
bluntly. "I asked you where you've been finding birds' eggs. And I'll
thank you to tell me, sir."
</p><p>Mr. Fox gave a slight start. Benny's tone was none too pleasant. And Mr.
Fox certainly didn't want to quarrel with him.
</p><p>"If you wish to know anything about birds' eggs, why don't you ask a
Prairie Chicken?" he inquired. "She would know a great deal more about
eggs than I do."
</p><p>To Benny, that suggestion seemed quite worth while. There was no doubt
that what Mr. Fox said was true. And Benny wondered why he hadn't
thought of the plan himself.
</p><p>"Your advice," he told Mr. Fox, "is so good that I'm going to start
right now to look for a Prairie Chicken. It's almost dawn now. And the
Chickens will soon be getting up."
</p><p>So Benny said good-by. And Mr. Fox tried to say good-by, too; but
somehow he choked over the words, and began to cough so violently that
Benny Badger was quite alarmed.
</p><p>He waited anxiously until he saw that Mr. Fox was out of danger. And
then he left him.
</p><p>If he had looked back he might have seen his sly friend capering about
in the gray light as if something amused him hugely. And no doubt Benny
would have wondered what it could have been.
</p><p>"Prairie Chickens!" Mr. Fox was chuckling. "Much they'll tell <u>him</u>
about eggs!"
