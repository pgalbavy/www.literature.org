<p>One Saturday, late in June, Thea arrived early for her lesson. As she
perched herself upon the piano stool,--a wobbly, old-fashioned thing
that worked on a creaky screw,--she gave Wunsch a side glance, smiling.
“You must not be cross to me to-day. This is my birthday.”
</p><p>“So?” he pointed to the keyboard.
</p><p>After the lesson they went out to join Mrs. Kohler, who had asked Thea
to come early, so that she could stay and smell the linden bloom. It was
one of those still days of intense light, when every particle of mica in
the soil flashed like a little mirror, and the glare from the plain
below seemed more intense than the rays from above. The sand ridges ran
glittering gold out to where the mirage licked them up, shining and
steaming like a lake in the tropics. The sky looked like blue lava,
forever incapable of clouds,--a turquoise bowl that was the lid of the
desert. And yet within Mrs. Kohler's green patch the water dripped, the
beds had all been hosed, and the air was fresh with rapidly evaporating
moisture.
</p><p>The two symmetrical linden trees were the proudest things in the garden.
Their sweetness embalmed all the air. At every turn of the
paths,--whether one went to see the hollyhocks or the bleeding heart, or
to look at the purple morning-glories that ran over the
bean-poles,--wherever one went, the sweetness of the lindens struck one
afresh and one always came back to them. Under the round leaves, where
the waxen yellow blossoms hung, bevies of wild bees were buzzing. The
tamarisks were still pink, and the flower-beds were doing their best in
honor of the linden festival. The white dove-house was shining with a
fresh coat of paint, and the pigeons were crooning contentedly, flying
down often to drink at the drip from the water tank. Mrs. Kohler, who
was transplanting pansies, came up with her trowel and told Thea it was
lucky to have your birthday when the lindens were in bloom, and that she
must go and look at the sweet peas. Wunsch accompanied her, and as they
walked between the flower-beds he took Thea's hand.
</p><p>“ES FLUSTERN UND SPRECHEN DIE BLUMEN,”--he muttered. “You know that von
Heine? IM LEUCHTENDEN SOMMERMORGEN?” He looked down at Thea and softly
pressed her hand.
</p><p>“No, I don't know it. What does FLUSTERN mean?”
</p><p>“FLUSTERN?--to whisper. You must begin now to know such things. That is
necessary. How many birthdays?”
</p><p>“Thirteen. I'm in my 'teens now. But how can I know words like that? I
only know what you say at my lessons. They don't teach German at school.
How can I learn?”
</p><p>“It is always possible to learn when one likes,” said Wunsch. His words
were peremptory, as usual, but his tone was mild, even confidential.
“There is always a way. And if some day you are going to sing, it is
necessary to know well the German language.”
</p><p>Thea stooped over to pick a leaf of rosemary. How did Wunsch know that,
when the very roses on her wall-paper had never heard it? “But am I
going to?” she asked, still stooping.
</p><p>“That is for you to say,” returned Wunsch coldly. “You would better
marry some JACOB here and keep the house for him, may-be? That is as one
desires.”
</p><p>Thea flashed up at him a clear, laughing look. “No, I don't want to do
that. You know,” she brushed his coat sleeve quickly with her yellow
head. “Only how can I learn anything here? It's so far from Denver.”
</p><p>Wunsch's loose lower lip curled in amusement. Then, as if he suddenly
remembered something, he spoke seriously. “Nothing is far and nothing is
near, if one desires. The world is little, people are little, human life
is little. There is only one big thing--desire. And before it, when it
is big, all is little. It brought Columbus across the sea in a little
boat, UND SO WEITER.” Wunsch made a grimace, took his pupil's hand and
drew her toward the grape arbor. “Hereafter I will more speak to you in
German. Now, sit down and I will teach you for your birthday that little
song. Ask me the words you do not know already. Now: IM LEUCHTENDEN
<strong>SOMMERMORGEN.”</strong>
</p><p>Thea memorized quickly because she had the power of listening intently.
In a few moments she could repeat the eight lines for him. Wunsch nodded
encouragingly and they went out of the arbor into the sunlight again. As
they went up and down the gravel paths between the flowerbeds, the white
and yellow butterflies kept darting before them, and the pigeons were
washing their pink feet at the drip and crooning in their husky bass.
Over and over again Wunsch made her say the lines to him. “You see it is
nothing. If you learn a great many of the LIEDER, you will know the
German language already. WEITER, NUN.” He would incline his head gravely
and listen.

     “IM LEUCHTENDEN SOMMERMORGEN
     GEH' ICH IM GARTEN HERUM;
     ES FLUSTERN UND SPRECHEN DIE BLUMEN,
     ICH ABER, ICH WANDTE STUMM.
     “ES FLUSTERN UND SPRECHEN DIE BLUMEN
     UND SCHAU'N MITLEIDIG MICH AN:
     'SEI UNSERER SCHWESTER NICHT BOSE,
     DU TRAURIGER, BLASSER MANN!'”</pre>

<pre>
     (In the soft-shining summer morning
     I wandered the garden within.
     The flowers they whispered and murmured,
     But I, I wandered dumb.
     The flowers they whisper and murmur,
     And me with compassion they scan:
     “Oh, be not harsh to our sister,
     Thou sorrowful, death-pale man!”)</pre>

<p>Wunsch had noticed before that when his pupil read anything in verse the
character of her voice changed altogether; it was no longer the voice
which spoke the speech of Moonstone. It was a soft, rich contralto, and
she read quietly; the feeling was in the voice itself, not indicated by
emphasis or change of pitch. She repeated the little verses musically,
like a song, and the entreaty of the flowers was even softer than the
rest, as the shy speech of flowers might be, and she ended with the
voice suspended, almost with a rising inflection. It was a nature-voice,
Wunsch told himself, breathed from the creature and apart from language,
like the sound of the wind in the trees, or the murmur of water.
</p><p>“What is it the flowers mean when they ask him not to be harsh to their
sister, eh?” he asked, looking down at her curiously and wrinkling his
dull red forehead.
</p><p>Thea glanced at him in surprise. “I suppose he thinks they are asking
him not to be harsh to his sweetheart--or some girl they remind him of.”
</p><p>“And why TRAURIGER, BLASSER MANN?”
</p><p>They had come back to the grape arbor, and Thea picked out a sunny place
on the bench, where a tortoise-shell cat was stretched at full length.
She sat down, bending over the cat and teasing his whiskers. “Because he
had been awake all night, thinking about her, wasn't it? Maybe that was
why he was up so early.”
</p><p>Wunsch shrugged his shoulders. “If he think about her all night already,
why do you say the flowers remind him?”
</p><p>Thea looked up at him in perplexity. A flash of comprehension lit her
face and she smiled eagerly. “Oh, I didn't mean 'remind' in that way! I
didn't mean they brought her to his mind! I meant it was only when he
came out in the morning, that she seemed to him like that,--like one of
the flowers.”
</p><p>“And before he came out, how did she seem?”
</p><p>This time it was Thea who shrugged her shoulders. The warm smile left
her face. She lifted her eyebrows in annoyance and looked off at the
sand hills.
</p><p>Wunsch persisted. “Why you not answer me?”
</p><p>“Because it would be silly. You are just trying to make me say things.
It spoils things to ask questions.”
</p><p>Wunsch bowed mockingly; his smile was disagreeable. Suddenly his face
grew grave, grew fierce, indeed. He pulled himself up from his clumsy
stoop and folded his arms. “But it is necessary to know if you know some
things. Some things cannot be taught. If you not know in the beginning,
you not know in the end. For a singer there must be something in the
inside from the beginning. I shall not be long in this place, may-be,
and I like to know. Yes,”--he ground his heel in the gravel,--“yes, when
you are barely six, you must know that already. That is the beginning of
all things; DER GEIST, DIE PHANTASIE. It must be in the baby, when it
makes its first cry, like DER RHYTHMUS, or it is not to be. You have
some voice already, and if in the beginning, when you are with
things-to-play, you know that what you will not tell me, then you can
learn to sing, may-be.”
</p><p>Wunsch began to pace the arbor, rubbing his hands together. The dark
flush of his face had spread up under the iron-gray bristles on his
head. He was talking to himself, not to Thea. Insidious power of the
linden bloom! “Oh, much you can learn! ABER NICHT DIE AMERICANISCHEN
FRAULEIN. They have nothing inside them,” striking his chest with both
fists. “They are like the ones in the MARCHEN, a grinning face and
hollow in the insides. Something they can learn, oh, yes, may-be! But
the secret--what make the rose to red, the sky to blue, the man to
love--IN DER BRUST, IN DER BRUST it is, UND OHNE DIESES GIEBT ES KEINE
KUNST, GIEBT ES KEINE KUNST!” He threw up his square hand and shook it,
all the fingers apart and wagging. Purple and breathless he went out of
the arbor and into the house, without saying good-bye. These outbursts
frightened Wunsch. They were always harbingers of ill.
</p><p>Thea got her music-book and stole quietly out of the garden. She did not
go home, but wandered off into the sand dunes, where the prickly pear
was in blossom and the green lizards were racing each other in the
glittering light. She was shaken by a passionate excitement. She did not
altogether understand what Wunsch was talking about; and yet, in a way
she knew. She knew, of course, that there was something about her that
was different. But it was more like a friendly spirit than like anything
that was a part of herself. She thought everything to it, and it
answered her; happiness consisted of that backward and forward movement
of herself. The something came and went, she never knew how. Sometimes
she hunted for it and could not find it; again, she lifted her eyes from
a book, or stepped out of doors, or wakened in the morning, and it was
there,--under her cheek, it usually seemed to be, or over her breast,--a
kind of warm sureness. And when it was there, everything was more
interesting and beautiful, even people. When this companion was with
her, she could get the most wonderful things out of Spanish Johnny, or
Wunsch, or Dr. Archie.
</p><p>On her thirteenth birthday she wandered for a long while about the sand
ridges, picking up crystals and looking into the yellow prickly-pear
blossoms with their thousand stamens. She looked at the sand hills until
she wished she WERE a sand hill. And yet she knew that she was going to
leave them all behind some day. They would be changing all day long,
yellow and purple and lavender, and she would not be there. From that
day on, she felt there was a secret between her and Wunsch. Together
they had lifted a lid, pulled out a drawer, and looked at something.
They hid it away and never spoke of what they had seen; but neither of
them forgot it.
