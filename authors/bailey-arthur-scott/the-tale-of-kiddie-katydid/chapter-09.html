<p>"Kiddie Katydid doesn't sing!" Freddie Firefly told Mr. Frog hurriedly.
</p>
<p>And Mr. Frog was so surprised that he almost sat right down in the mud.
</p><p>"What do you mean?" he cried. "You must be crazy! For there isn't a
single person in all Pleasant Valley that hasn't heard Kiddie Katydid
singing his tiresome song on a fine midsummer night."
</p><p>"That--" replied Freddie Firefly--"that is just where you're mistaken,
Mr. Frog. And that's where everybody else is mistaken, too. To-night I
was lucky enough to learn that Kiddie Katydid has been fooling us all
this time."
</p><p>"You don't say so!" said Mr. Frog. "Then who is it that sings that
everlasting chorus?"
</p><p>"Nobody!"
</p><p>"Nonsense!" Mr. Frog scoffed. "I can be fooled once, maybe. But I'm not
to be fooled twice. And you needn't think for a moment that you can make
me believe any such thing."
</p><p>"I don't care whether you believe it or not," Freddie Firefly declared.
"All I ask you to do is to tell the story to Mr. Crow."
</p><p>"He won't believe it, either," the tailor retorted.
</p><p>"Perhaps he will when he hears the rest of the message," Freddie
answered. "I was just going to explain that Kiddie Katydid has a trick
of rubbing his wing covers together to make that <u>Katy did</u> sound."
</p><p>"For the land's sake!" cried Mr. Frog, as he leaped into the water,
convinced at last of the truth of Freddie Firefly's claim. "I must hurry
home at once, for dawn's already breaking. And Mr. Crow may come sailing
over my place at any moment." He landed with a splash in the creek and
started to swim rapidly away. But after a few strokes he paused and
turned around. "You might almost say that Kiddie Katydid is a fiddler,
mightn't you?" he called.
</p><p>"Something like that!" Freddie Firefly agreed a bit doubtfully.
</p><p>"I'll tell Mr. Crow that, anyhow," said the tailor. "It will make the
story more interesting, at least. And so far as I can see, it can't do
any harm."
</p><p>And then he hastened away, leaving Freddie Firefly to get home as best
he could in the gray of the early morning.
</p><p>"You may as well put out your light!" Mr. Frog shouted back, as he
disappeared among the reeds. But he didn't wait to see whether Freddie
took his advice. He was too much excited over the strange news. And as
he swam easily along with practiced strokes he kept talking to himself.
</p><p>"I'm a pretty clever chap, I am!" he chuckled. "I've discovered a great
secret this night. And old Mr. Crow will be glad to hear all about it.
Perhaps he'll want me to help him with his newspaper after this.
</p><p>"And for all I know I'll have so much to do that I won't be able to make
any more clothes for my customers."
</p><p>He hadn't swum far before he had entirely forgotten that it was really
Freddie Firefly who had discovered the secret and told it to him.
</p><p>No doubt if anybody had reminded Mr. Frog of that fact he would have
been very indignant.
