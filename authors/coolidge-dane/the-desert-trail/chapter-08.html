<p>There are some people in this world with whom it seems impossible to
quarrel, notably the parents of attractive daughters.
</p><p>Perhaps, if Gracia Aragon had not been watching him from the window,
Philip De Lancey would not have been quite so cordial with her
father--at least, that was what Hooker thought, and he was so badly
peeved at the way things had gone that he said it, too.
</p><p>Then, of course, they quarreled, and one thing leading to another, Phil
told Bud he had a very low way of speaking. Bud replied, that whatever
his deficiencies of speech might be, he was not fool enough to be drawn
in by a skirt, and Phil rebuked him again. Then, with a scornful grunt,
Bud Hooker rode on in silence and they said no more about it.
</p><p>It was a gay life that they led at night, for the Fortuna Hotel was
filled with men of their kind, since all the staid married men had
either moved across the line with their families or were under orders
to come straight home.
</p><p>In the daytime the hotel was nearly deserted, for every man in town was
working for the company; but in the evening, when they gathered around
the massive stove, it was a merry company indeed.
</p><p>There were college men, full of good stories and stories not so good,
world-wanderers and adventurers with such tales of the East and West
as never have been written in books. But not a college boy could match
stories with Phil De Lancey, and few wanderers there were who could
tell him anything new about Mexico. Also, when it came to popular
songs, he knew both the words and the tune. So he was much in demand,
and Don Juan passed many drinks across the bar because of him.
</p><p>In all such festivities the two pardners stayed together; Bud, with a
broad, indulgent grin, listening to the end, and Phil, his eyes alight
with liquor and good cheer, talking and laughing far into the night.
</p><p>Outside the winter winds were still cold and the Mexicans went wrapped
to the eyebrows; but within the merry company was slow to quit, and
Phil, making up for the lonely months when he had entirely lacked an
audience, sat long in the seat of honor and was always the last to go.
</p><p>But on the evening after their spat Bud sat off to one side,
and even Phil's sprightly and ventriloquistic conversation with
the-little-girl-behind-the-door called forth only a fleeting smile.
</p><p>Bud was thinking, and when engaged in that arduous occupation even the
saucy little girl behind the door could not beguile him.
</p><p>But, after he had studied it all out and come to a definite conclusion,
he did not deliver an ultimatum. The old, good-natured smile simply
came back to his rugged face; he rolled a cigarette; and then for
the rest of the evening he lay back and enjoyed the show. Only in the
morning, when they went out to the corral to get their horses, he
carried his war-bag with him and, after throwing the saddle on Copper
Bottom, he did the same for their spare mount.
</p><p>"What are you going to pack out, Bud?" inquired Phil, and Bud slapped
his canvas-covered bed for an answer. Then, with a heave, he snaked it
out of the harness-room where it had been stored and slung it deftly
across the pack-saddle.
</p><p>"Why, what's the matter?" said De Lancey, when they were on their way.
"Don't you like the hotel?"
</p><p>"Hotel's fine," conceded Bud, "but I reckon I'd better camp out at the
mine. Want to keep my eye on that Mexican of ours."
</p><p>"Aw, he's all right," protested Phil.
</p><p>"Sure," said Bud; "I ain't afraid he'll steal something--but he might
take a notion to quit the country."
</p><p>"Why, what for?" challenged De Lancey. "He's got his wife and family
here."
</p><p>"That's nothing--to a Mexican!" countered Bud. "But I ain't figuring on
the excuse he'd give--that won't buy me nothing--what I want to do is
to keep him from going. Because if we lose that Mex now, we lose our
mine."
</p><p>"And--"
</p><p>"No 'and' to it," said Bud doggedly. "We ain't going to lose him."
</p><p>"But if we did," persisted De Lancey, "why, then you think--"
</p><p>"Your friend would get it," finished Hooker grimly.
</p><p>"Ah, I see," nodded De Lancey, noting the accent on "friend." "You
don't approve of my making friends with Aragon."
</p><p>"Oh, that's all right," shrugged the big cowboy. "It won't make no
difference now. Go ahead, if you want to."
</p><p>"You mean you can get along without me?"
</p><p>"No," answered Bud. "I don't mean nothing--except what I say. If you
want to palaver around with Aragon, go to it. I'll round up Mendez
and his family and keep 'em right there at the mine until we get them
papers signed--after that I don't care what happens."
</p><p>"Oh, all right," murmured De Lancey in a subdued tone; but if his
conscience smote him for the moment it did not lead to the making of
any sentimental New Year's resolutions, for he stopped when he came
to the store and exchanged salutations with Aragon, who was lounging
expectantly before his door.
</p><p>"<u>Buenos días</u>, Don Cipriano!" he hailed. "How are you this morning?"
</p><p>"Ah, good morning, Don Felipe," responded Aragon, stepping forth from
the shadow of the door. "I am very well, thank you--and you?"
</p><p>"The same!" answered Phil, as if it were a great piece of news. "It is
fine weather--no?"
</p><p>"Yes, but a little dry," said Aragon, and so they passed it back and
forth in the accepted Spanish manner, while Bud hooked one leg over the
horn of his saddle and regarded the <u>hacienda</u> with languid eyes.
</p><p>But as his gaze swept the length of the vine-covered <u>corredor</u> it
halted for a moment and a slow smile came over his face. In the green
depths of a passion-flower vine he had detected a quick, birdlike
motion; and then suddenly, like a transformation scene, he beheld a
merry face, framed and illuminated by soft, golden locks, peering out
at him from among the blossoms. Except for that brief smile he made
no sign that he saw her, and when he looked up again the face had
disappeared.
</p><p>Don Cipriano showed them about his <u>mescal</u> plant, where his men kept a
continual stream of liquid fire running from the copper worm, and gave
each a raw drink; but though De Lancey gazed admiringly at the house
and praised the orange-trees that hung over the garden wall, Spanish
hospitality could go no farther, and the visit ended in a series of
<u>adioses</u> and <u>muchas graciases</u>.
</p><p>"Quick work!" commented Phil, as they rode toward the mine. "The old
man has got over his grouch."
</p><p>"Um," mused Bud, with a quiet, brooding smile; and the next time he
rode into town he looked for the masked face among the flowers and
smiled again. That was the way Gracia Aragon affected them all.
</p><p>He did not point out the place to Phil, nor betray her by any sign. All
he did was to glance at her once and then ride on his way, but somehow
his heart stood still when he met her eyes, and his days became filled
with a pensive, brooding melancholy.
</p><p>"What's the matter, Bud?" rallied Phil, after he had jollied him for a
week. "You're getting mighty quiet lately. Got another hunch--like that
one you had up at Agua Negra?"
</p><p>"Nope," grinned Bud; "but I'll tell you one thing--if old Aragon
don't spring something pretty soon I'm going to get uneasy. He's too
dog-goned good-natured about this."
</p><p>"Maybe he thinks we're stuck," suggested De Lancey.
</p><p>"Well, he's awful happy about something," said Bud. "I can see by the
way he droops that game eye of his--and smiles that way--that he knows
we're working for him. If we don't get a title to this mine, every tap
of work we do on it is all to the good for him, that's a cinch. So sit
down now and think it out--where's the joker?"
</p><p>"Well," mused Phil, "the gold is here somewhere. He knows we're not
fooled there. And he knows we're right after it, the way we're driving
this cut in. Our permit is good--he hasn't tried to buffalo Mendez--and
it's a cinch he can't denounce the claim himself."
</p><p>"Maybe he figures on letting us do all the work and pay all the
denouncement fees and then spring something big on old One-Eye,"
propounded Bud. "Scare 'im up or buy 'im off, and have him transfer the
title to <u>him</u>. That's the way he worked Kruger."
</p><p>"Well, say," urged Phil, "let's go ahead with our denouncement before
he starts something. Besides, the warm weather is coming on now,
and if we don't get a move on we're likely to get run out by the
<u>revoltosos</u>."
</p><p>"Nope," said Bud; "I don't put this into Mendez's hands until I
know he's our man--and if I ever do go ahead I'll keep him under my
six-shooter until the last paper is signed, believe me. I know we're in
bad somewhere, but hurrying up won't help none.
</p><p>"Now I tell you what we'll do--you go to the mining agent and get
copies of all our papers and send them up to that Gadsden lawyer. I'm
going to go down and board with Mendez and see if I can read his heart."
</p><p>So they separated, and while Phil stayed in town to look over the
records Bud ate his beans and <u>tortillas</u> with the Mendez family.
</p><p>They were a happy little family, comfortably installed in the stone
house that Mendez had built, and rapidly getting fat on three full
meals a day. From his tent farther up the cañon Bud could look down and
watch the children at play and see the comely Indian wife as she cooked
by the open fire.
</p><p>Certainly no one could be more innocent and contented than she was, and
El Tuerto was all bows and protestations of gratitude. And yet, you
never can tell.
</p><p>Bud had moved out of the new house to furnish quarters for El Tuerto
and had favored him in every way; but this same consideration might
easily be misinterpreted, for the Mexicans are slow to understand
kindness.
</p><p>So, while on the one hand he had treated them generously, he had
always kept his distance, lest they be tempted to presume. But now,
with Phil in town for a few days, he took his meals with Maria, who was
too awed to say a word, and made friends with the dogs and the children.
</p><p>The way to the dog's heart was easy, almost direct, and he finally
won the attention of little Pancho and Josefa with a well-worn Sunday
supplement. This gaudy institution, with its spicy stories and
startling illustrations, had penetrated even to the wilds of Sonora,
and every Sunday as regularly as the paper came Bud sat down and had
his laugh over the funny page.
</p><p>But to Pancho, who was six years old and curious, this same highly
colored sheet was a mystery of mysteries, and when he saw the big
American laughing he crept up and looked at it wistfully.
</p><p>"<u>Mira</u>," said Bud, laying his finger upon the smirking visage of one
of the comic characters, "look, and I will tell you the story."
</p><p>And so, with laborious care, he translated the colored fun, while the
little Mendezes squirmed with excitement and leaped with joy. Even the
simple souls of El Tuerto and Maria were moved the by <u>comicas</u>, and
Mendez became so interested that he learned the words by heart, the
better to explain them to others.
</p><p>But as for Mexican treachery, Bud could find none of it. In fact,
finding them so simple-hearted and good-natured, he became half ashamed
of his early suspicions and waited for the return of Phil to explain
Don Cipriano's complacency.
</p><p>But the next Sunday, as Bud lay reading in his tent, the mystery
solved itself. Cruz Mendez came up from the house, hat in hand and
an apologetic smile on his face, and after the customary roundabout
remarks he asked the boss as a favor if he would lend him the page of
comic pictures.
</p><p>"_Seguro!_" assented Bud, rolling over and fumbling for the funny
sheet; then, failing to find it instantly, he inquired: "What do you
want it for?"
</p><p>"Ah, to show to my boy!" explained El Tuerto, his one eye lighting up
with pride.
</p><p>"Who--Pancho?"
</p><p>"Ah, no, <u>señor</u>," answered Mendez simply, "my boy in La Fortuna, the
one you have not seen."
</p><p>Bud stopped fumbling for the paper and sat up suddenly. Here was a new
light on their faithful servitor, and one that might easily take away
from his value as a dummy locator.
</p><p>"Oh!" he said, and then: "How many children have you, Cruz?"
</p><p>Cruz smiled deprecatingly, as parents will, and turned away.
</p><p>"By which woman?" he inquired, and Bud became suddenly very calm,
fearing the worst. For if Cruz was not legally married to Maria, he
could not transfer the mining claim.
</p><p>"By all of them," he said quietly.
</p><p>"Five in all," returned Cruz--"three by Maria, as you know--two by my
first woman--and one other. I do not count him."
</p><p>"Well, you one-eyed old reprobate!" muttered Bud in his throat, but he
passed it off and returned smiling to the charge.
</p><p>"Where does your boy live now?" he asked with flattering solicitude,
the better to make him talk, "and is he old enough to understand the
pictures?"
</p><p>"Ah, yes!" beamed Mendez, "he is twelve years old. He lives with his
mother now--and my little daughter, too. Their <u>mama</u> is the woman of
the <u>mayordomo</u> of the Señor Aragon--a bad man, very ugly--she is not
married to <u>him</u>."
</p><p>"But with you--" suggested Bud, regarding him with a steely stare.
</p><p>"Only by the judge!" explained Mendez virtuously. "It was a love-match
and the priest did not come--so we were married by the judge. Then this
bad <u>mayordomo</u> stole her away from me--the pig--and I married Maria
instead. Maria is a good woman and I married her before the priest--but
I love my other children too, even though they are not lawful."
</p><p>"So you married your first wife before the judge," observed Bud
cynically, "and this one before the priest. But how could you do that,
unless you had been divorced?"
</p><p>"Ah, <u>señor</u>," protested Mendez, holding out his hands, "you do not
understand. It is only the church that can really marry--the judge does
it only for the money. Maria is my true wife--and we have three nice
children--but as I am going through La Fortuna I should like to show
the picture paper to my boy."
</p><p>Bud regarded him in meditative silence, then he rose up and began a
determined search for the funny sheet.
</p><p>"All right," he said, handing it over, "and here is a <u>panoche</u> of
sugar for your little girl--the one in La Fortuna. It is nothing," he
added, as Mendez began his thanks.
</p><p>"But oh, you marrying Mexican," he continued, relapsing into his mother
tongue as El Tuerto disappeared; "you certainly have dished us right!"
