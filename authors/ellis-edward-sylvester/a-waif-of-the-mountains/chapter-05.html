<p>All this may seem a trifling matter to the reader who does not
understand the real punishment suffered by these two men, who,
like all the rest of their companions, had been accustomed to
the use of ardent spirits for many years. There was no deprivation
which they could not have borne with less distress, but their
great consolation was that both knew the penalty was fully deserved,
and they would not have complained had it been made more severe.</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Bidwell, at the end of the fourth day, when
he had celebrated his release from purgatory, "it pays, Ruggles."</p>

<p>"What pays?"</p>

<p>"The reward you git for all this. At the end of a week you'll
have a thirst that you wouldn't take a thousand dollars fur."</p>

<p>"But the week isn't much more'n half gone and I'd sell my thirst
mighty cheap now."</p>

<p>"Don't you do it! Hold fast to it."</p>

<p>"That's what I'm doing, 'cause I can't help myself. Howsumever
it's the thirst that's holding fast to me."</p>

<p>"That's the beauty of it; it'll git stronger and stronger, and
then it's so big that you can't well handle it. It seems to me
that ten minutes after I've had a drink, I'm thirsty agin, which
reminds me; I'd like to invite you, Wade."</p>

<p>"Invite all you want to, 'cause it won't do any more hurt than
good; don't let me keep you," added Ruggles, observing the longing
eyes his friend cast in the direction of the Heavenly Bower. Bidwell
moved off with pretended reluctance, out of consideration for
the feelings of his friend, but once inside, he gave another demonstration
of the truth of his remarks concerning thirst.</p>

<p>As for Ruggles, only he who has been similarly placed can appreciate
his trial. No man is so deserving of sympathy as he who is making
a resolute effort to conquer the debasing appetite that has brought
him to the gutter.</p>

<p>On that fourth night the thirst of the fellow was a raging fever.
He drank copious draughts of spring water, but all the help it
gave was to fill him up. The insatiate craving remained and could
not be soothed. It seemed as if every nerve was crying out for
the stimulant which it was denied.</p>

<p>"The only time I ever went through anything like this," he said
to himself, "was twenty years ago, when a party of us were lost
in the Death Valley. Three of 'em died of thirst, and I come so
nigh it that it makes me shudder to think of it even at this late
day."</p>

<p>A wonderful experience came to Wade Ruggles. To his unbounded
amazement, he noticed a sensible diminution, on the fifth day,
of his thirst. It startled him at first and caused something in
the nature of alarm. He feared some radical change had taken place
in his system which threatened a dangerous issue. When this misgiving
passed, it was succeeded by something of the nature of regret.
One consoling reflection from the moment his torture began, was
the reward which Al Bidwell had named, that is,&mdash;the glorious
enjoyment of fully quenching his terrific craving, but, if that
craving diminished, the future bliss must shrink in a corresponding
ratio, and <em>that</em> was a calamity to make a man like him
shudder.</p>

<p>On the evening of the fifth day, he ventured for the first time
during his penal term, to enter the Heavenly Bower. He wished
to test his self-control. When he sat quietly and saw his friends
imbibing, and was yet able to restrain himself from a headlong
rush to join them, he knew that beyond all question, his fearful
appetite had lost a part of its control over him. Still he believed
it was only a temporary disarrangement, and that the following
day would bring a renewal of his thirst, with all its merciless
violence.</p>

<p>But lo! on the sixth morning, the appetite was weaker than ever.
His craving was so moderate that, after a deep draught of mountain
spring water, he was hardly conscious of any longing for liquor.
He seemed to be losing his memory of it.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," he mused, keeping the astonishing truth
to himself; "It's less than a week ago that I was one of the heaviest
drinkers in New Constantinople, and if anyone had told me of this,
I would have been sure he'd lost his senses, which the same may
be what's the matter with me."</p>

<p>But there was no awakening of his torment during the day, and
when he lay down at night, he was disturbed by strange musings.</p>

<p>"If we had a doctor in the place, I would ask him to tell me
what it means. The queerest thing 'bout the whole bus'ness is
that I feel three thousand per cent. better. I wonder if it can
be on 'count of my not swallerin' any of Ortigies' pison which
the same he calls Mountain Dew. I guess it must be that."</p>

<p>But that night he was restless, and gradually his thoughts turned
into a new channel. A momentous problem presented itself for solution.</p>

<p>"If I've improved so much after goin' six days without drinkin',
won't I feel a blamed sight better, if I try it for six weeks&mdash;six
months&mdash;six years&mdash;<em>forever</em>."</p>

<p>And as an extraordinary, a marvelous resolution simmered and
finally crystallized, he chortled.</p>

<p>"What'll the boys say? What'll the parson think? What'll I think?
What would that good old mother of mine think, if she was alive?
But she died afore she knowed what a good for nothin' man her
boy turned out to be. God rest her soul!" he added softly, "she
must have prayed over me a good many hundred times; if she's kept
track of me all these years, this is an answer to her prayers."</p>

<p>Budge Isham was the partner of Wade, and shared his cabin with
him. He slept across the room, and noticed how his friend tossed
and muttered in his sleep.</p>

<p>"Great Gee!" he exclaimed, "but Wade's got it pretty bad; I wonder
if it's the jim jams that is getting hold of him; I'll sleep with
one eye open, for he will need looking after. What a blessed thing
it is that he has only one more day. Then he can celebrate and
be happy. I have no doubt that by the end of another week, he
will have brought things up to their old average."</p>

<p>And with this conclusion, the man who a few years before took
the first honors at Yale, shifted his position, so as to keep
an eye on his comrade, and straightway proceeded to drop into
a sound slumber, which was not broken until the sun rose on the
following morning.</p>

<p>The sympathy for Wade was general. Had he not insisted upon carrying
out in spirit and letter the full punishment pronounced upon him,
there would have been a unanimous agreement to commute his term
by one or two days at least; but all knew the grit or "sand" of
the fellow too well to propose it.</p>

<p>His actions on the seventh day caused considerable disquietude.
He had labored in the mines, in a desultory fashion up to that
time, but he did not do a stroke of work during the concluding
hours of his ordeal. It was observed by his partner, Budge Isham,
that his appetite was unusually good and he seemed to be in high
spirits. His friends attributed this to the closeness of his reward
for his abstention, but he took several walks up the mountain
side and was gone for a good while. He wore a smiling face and
Vose Adams declared that he overheard him communing with himself,
when he thought he was too far off for the act to be noticed.</p>

<p>"No use of talkin'," whispered Vose; "Wade ain't quite himself;
he's a little off and won't be exactly right till after two or
three days."</p>

<p>"He has my sympathy," remarked the parson, "but it will serve
as a lesson which he will always remember."</p>

<p>"And won't <em>we</em> remember it?" said Ike Hoe, with a shudder.
"When we're disposed to say one of them unproper words, the picture
of that miserable scamp going a full week without a touch of Mountain
Dew, will freeze up our lips closer than a clam."</p>

<p>That night the usual group was gathered at the Heavenly Bower.
There were the same merry jests, the reminiscences, the conjectures
how certain diggings would pan out, the small talk and the general
good feeling. Common hardship and suffering had brought these
rough men close to one another. They were indulgent and charitable
and each one would have eagerly risked his life for the sake of
the rest. Quick to anger, they were equally quick to forgive,
mutually rejoicing in good fortune, and mutually sympathetic in
sorrow.</p>

<p>There was more than one furtive glance at Ruggles, who was among
the first arrivals. Whispers had passed around of his strange
actions, and the surprise would not have been great had it been
found that he had gone clean daft; but nothing in his manner indicated
anything of that nature. He was as full of quip and jest as ever,
and none was in higher or more buoyant spirits than he.</p>

<p>He suddenly called:</p>

<p>"Dawson, what time is it?"</p>

<p>The latest comer among them carried a watch which he drew out
and examined.</p>

<p>"It is exactly half-past nine."</p>

<p>"When did my punishment begin?"</p>

<p>"A week ago to-night, precisely at this hour; I began to fear
that you had forgotten it."</p>

<p>"No danger of my ever forgetting it," grimly responded Ruggles;
"what I want to know is whether I have served out my full term."</p>

<p>"You have unquestionably."</p>

<p>"Is there anyone here disposed to dispute this statement?" asked
Wade, standing very erect and looking around in the faces of his
friends.</p>

<p>No one interposed an objection. He had not only the sympathy
but the respect of every one.</p>

<p>"You sarved your time like a man," remarked Ike Hoe; "the week
is up and you've give good measure."</p>

<p>"Which the same being the case, I invite all to come forward
and liquidate."</p>

<p>Never was an invitation responded to with more enthusiasm. The
grinning Ortigies set out a couple of bottles, intending as a
matter of course to join in the celebration. He feelingly remarked:</p>

<p>"Wade, my heart bled for you and thar ain't a pard here that
wouldn't have been willing to take your place&mdash;that is for a limited
time," the landlord hastened to add.</p>

<p>Each tumbler was half-filled with the fiery stuff and all looked
in smiling expectancy at their host to give the cue. He poured
a small quantity into his glass, and elevating it almost to a
level with his lips, looked over the top.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, pards? here goes."</p>

<p>Up went every glass and down went the stuff. But there was one
exception. While the glass was at his lips, and while the familiar
odor was in his nostrils, Wade Ruggles deliberately inverted the
tumbler and emptied the contents on the floor.</p>

<p>It was the strangest incident that had ever occurred in New Constantinople.</p>
