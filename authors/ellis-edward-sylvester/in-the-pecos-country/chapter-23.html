<p>Fred Munson was right. In his efforts to regain the pass by which
he had entered the mountains, he had gone astray, and he knew
no more in what direction to turn than if he had dropped from
the moon. The sun was now well up above the horizon, and he not
only had the mortification of feeling that he had lost much precious
time, but that he was likely to lose much more.</p>

<p>With the feeling of disappointment came that of hunger, and he
questioned himself as to how he was likely to obtain that with
which to stave off the pangs of hunger.</p>

<p>"There isn't any use of staying here," he exclaimed, desperately,
"unless I want to lie down and die, and I ain't quite ready for
that yet. It is pretty sure the ravine ain't straight ahead, so
it must be more to one side."</p>

<p>And, acting upon this conclusion, he made quite a change in the
direction he was pursuing, moving off to the left, and encouraging
himself with the fact that the pass must be somewhere, and he
had only to persevere in exploring each point of the compass to
reach it at last. His route continued as precipitous and difficult
as before, and it was not long before the plague of thirst became
greater than that of hunger. But he persevered, hopeful that his
wearisome wandering would soon end.</p>

<p>"Halloa! Here I am again."</p>

<p>This exclamation was caused by the sudden arrival upon the edge
of a ravine, which, on first thought, he supposed to be the very
one for which he was making. But a second glance convinced him
of his error, for it was nothing more than a yawn, or chasm, that
had probably been opened in the mountains by some great convulsion
of nature.</p>

<p>Making his way carefully to the edge, Fred saw that it had a
varying depth of fifty to two hundred feet, and a width from a
dozen yards to three times as much, its length seemingly too great
to be "gone round"  by an ordinary traveler. And yet, finding
himself confronted by such a chasm, it was perhaps natural that
the lad should become more fully pursuaded than ever of the absolute
necessity of placing himself upon the opposite side. The more
he thought upon it the more convinced did he become, until his
desire of passing over became a wild sort of eagerness that would
not let him rest.</p>

<p>"I don't believe the pass is more than a hundred yards from the
other side, and the two must run nearly parallel, so I am bound
to get over in some way."</p>

<p>In the hope that some narrow portion might be found, he made
his way with great care along the margin, until fully an hour
had been spent in this manner, with a result that could not be
called very satisfactory.</p>

<p>"If I could jump about three times as far as I can, I could go
across right yonder&mdash;helloa! why did n't I notice that before?"</p>

<p>And the words were yet in his mouth, when he started on a run
along the margin of the ravine, at the imminent risk of falling
in and breaking his neck. He had espied not only a narrower portion
of the ravine, but what seemed to be a fallen tree extending from
one side to the other.</p>

<p>If such were really the case, what more could he need? He had
thought over this matter of the pass being upon the other side,
until no doubt at all remained in his mind, and now the discovery
that the chasm was bridged caused the strongest rebound from discouragement
to hope.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the bridge, he found that it answered his purpose
admirably. The width was less than ten yards, although the depth
was enough to make him shudder, when he peered down into it.</p>

<p>He flung a stone, and, as it went spinning downward, it seemed
to him that many seconds elapsed before it struck the bottom with
a dull thud.</p>

<p>But the tree seemed strong enough to answer every purpose, and
capable of bearing a weight much greater than his.</p>

<p>The trunk at the largest part was fully a foot in diameter, and
the top extended far enough over the opposite edge to prevent
any weakness from the thinning out of the branches.</p>

<p>But what astonished Fred more than anything else, was the discovery
that the tree had been felled not, by nature, but by man. The
trunk had been cut through, clearly and evenly, by some sharp
instrument, and beyond question had been used as a bridge before.</p>

<p>"Somebody has been here ahead of me," reflected the lad, as he
examined this interesting evidence, "and I don't believe it was
an Indian, either. I don't know what could bring a party into
this part of the world, but they have been here surely, and if
the bridge was good enough for them, it will do for me."</p>

<p>He was quite certain that he could walk over, after the fashion
of Blondin, but it would have been foolhardy in the highest degree,
and he adopted the wiser course of putting himself astride of
the trunk, and hitching along a few inches at a time. His rifle
interfered somewhat, but he kept up his progress, pausing a few
seconds at the centre of the chasm to look down at the bottom
far below him.</p>

<p>"Suppose the tree should break," he exclaimed, in a frightened
whisper, "it would be the last of a fellow! No one could drop
down there, and save his neck without a parachute. I guess the
best thing I can do is to get over as soon as I know how&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this juncture, as he was on the point of resuming his onward
progress, he noticed a peculiar jar of the log, accompanied by
a scratching. Mis first impression was that it came from behind,
but, upon turning his head, could see nothing. When, however,
he looked forward, the terrible explanation at once appeared.</p>

<p>The head or top of the tree was unusually bushy and luxuriant,
and, although a considerable time had elapsed since it had been
felled, yet there were a great many leaves clinging to the branches&mdash;not
enough to afford concealment to any animal fleeing from a hunter.
Then Fred first looked in that direction, he failed to see that
one of the most dangerous animals of the Southwest was crouching
there.</p>

<p>As he looked inquiringly ahead now, he observed a huge American
cougar, larger than that of the night before, issuing from among
the branches. With his phosphorescent eyes fixed upon the terrified
lad, he was stealing slowly along the log, giving utterance to
a deep guttural growl, separating his lips as he did so, so as
to show his long, white, needle-like teeth, intended for the rending
of flesh.</p>

<p>For a moment Fred was transfixed at the sight.</p>

<p>The cougar clearly meant fight, and assumed the offensive without
a second's hesitancy. He seemed to have been crouching in the
bushes, and calmly awaited the time when the boy should advance
too far to retreat.</p>

<p>"I guess I'd better go back!" exclaimed the latter, recovering
himself, and beginning his retrograde movement; but a few hitches
showed that he could not escape the cougar in this fashion, if
he really meant business, and it looked very much as if he did.</p>

<p>The beast had already left the other side, and, like his intended
victim, was supported over the chasm by the tree. He had advanced
beyond the fork made by the junction of the lowermost branches
with the main stem, and was stealing along with an appearance
of excessive caution, but really with the certainty of a brute
who feels that there is no escape for his prey. He moved slowly,
burying his long, sharp claws so deeply in the bark at each step,
that his feet seemed to stick as he lifted them again. All the
time his large, round eyes, which had a greenish glare like those
of a cat, were never removed from the face of the lad, and the
guttural growl that came from the lowermost depths of his chest
was like the muttering of distant thunder.</p>

<p>It was not until about a dozen feet separated the two that Fred
recalled that his case was not so desperate as he had imagined.
He held a loaded rifle at his command, and the distance was too
short for any mistake to be made in the aim.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll stop <em>your</em> fun!" was the exultant exclamation
of the lad, as he brought his rifle to his shoulder. "I don't
like to throw away a shot on you, but I don't see how it can be
helped."</p>

<p>He sighted directly between the eyes. His hand shook a little,
and the weapon was heavy, but it was impossible that he should
miss.</p>

<p>The cougar continued his slow, cautious advance, apparently unaware
or uncaring for the deadly weapon aimed at him.</p>

<p>The distance was very slight between the two when the trigger
was pulled, and the heavy bullet, tearing its way through bone
and muscle, buried itself in the brain, extinguishing life with
the suddenness almost of the lightning stroke. The guttural growl
wound up with something like a hoarse yelp, and the cougar made
what might be termed his death-leap.</p>

<p>The bound was a tremendous one, carrying him clear up over the
head of the lad, who crouched down in affright, expecting him
to drop upon his shoulders; but he passed far beyond, dropping
upon the trunk of the tree, which he clutched and clawed in his
blind, frantic way, without saving himself in the least, and down
he went.</p>

<p>Fred was held with a sort of fascination, and had turned his
head sufficiently to watch every movement of his victim. Then
he started downward, his whitish belly was turned upward, while
he continued to beat and claw the air in his death struggles.</p>

<p>As is the tendency of falling bodies, the carcass of the cougar
showed an inclination to revolve. It began slowly turning over
as it descended, and it must have completed several revolutions
when it struck the rocky ground below like a limp bundle of rags,
and lay motionless.</p>

<p>The boy, from his lofty perch, watched the form below him for
several minutes, but could detect no sign of life, and rightly
concluded there was none.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether there are any more there," he exclaimed, hesitating
to go backward, while he scrutinized the branches with the keenest
kind of anxiety. "I do n't see any chance where one could hide,
and yet I did n't see that other fellow."</p>

<p>It was hardly possible that he should find a companion to the
one he had just slain, and he resumed his hitching forward, making
it as deliberate and careful as he could. Clutching the branches,
he hurried forward and was soon upon the other side of the chasm
which had come so nigh witnessing his death. Without pausing longer
he hastened on and was not long in placing himself upon the top
of the elevation from which he was so confident of gaining his
view of the promised land, as the pass had become to him, now
that it seemed so difficult to find, and was so necessary to anything
like progress.</p>

<p>But another disappointment awaited him. The most careful scrutiny
failed to reveal anything like the ravine, and poor Fred was forced
to the conclusion that he was hopelessly lost, and nothing but
Providence could bring him through the labyrinth of peril in which
he was entangled.</p>
