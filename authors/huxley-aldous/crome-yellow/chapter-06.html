<p>Mr. Barbecue-Smith arrived in time for tea on Saturday afternoon.
He was a short and corpulent man, with a very large head and no
neck. In his earlier middle age he had been distressed by this
absence of neck, but was comforted by reading in Balzac’s "Louis
Lambert" that all the world’s great men have been marked by the
same peculiarity, and for a simple and obvious reason: Greatness
is nothing more nor less than the harmonious functioning of the
faculties of the head and heart; the shorter the neck, the more
closely these two organs approach one another; argal...It was
convincing.</p>

<p>Mr. Barbecue-Smith belonged to the old school of journalists.
He sported a leonine head with a greyish-black mane of oddly unappetising
hair brushed back from a broad but low forehead. And somehow he
always seemed slightly, ever so slightly, soiled. In younger days
he had gaily called himself a Bohemian. He did so no longer. He
was a teacher now, a kind of prophet. Some of his books of comfort
and spiritual teaching were in their hundred and twentieth thousand.</p>

<p>Priscilla received him with every mark of esteem. He had never
been to Crome before; she showed him round the house. Mr. Barbecue-Smith
was full of admiration.</p>

<p>"So quaint, so old-world," he kept repeating. He had a rich,
rather unctuous voice.</p>

<p>Priscilla praised his latest book. "Splendid, I thought it was,"
she said in her large, jolly way.</p>

<p>"I’m happy to think you found it a comfort," said Mr. Barbecue-Smith.</p>

<p>"Oh, tremendously! And the bit about the Lotus Pool &mdash;I
thought that so beautiful."</p>

<p>"I knew you would like that. It came to me, you know, from without."
He waved his hand to indicate the astral world.</p>

<p>They went out into the garden for tea. Mr. Barbecue-Smith was
duly introduced.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stone is a writer too," said Priscilla, as she introduced
Denis.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Mr. Barbecue-Smith smiled benignly, and, looking up
at Denis with an expression of Olympian condescension, "And what
sort of things do you write?"</p>

<p>Denis was furious, and, to make matters worse, he felt himself
blushing hotly. Had Priscilla no sense of proportion? She was
putting them in the same category &mdash;Barbecue-Smith and himself.
They were both writers, they both used pen and ink. To Mr. Barbecue-Smith’s
question he answered, "Oh, nothing much, nothing," and looked
away.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stone is one of our younger poets." It was Anne’s voice.
He scowled at her, and she smiled back exasperatingly.</p>

<p>"Excellent, excellent," said Mr. Barbecue-Smith, and he squeezed
Denis’s arm encouragingly. "The Bard’s is a noble calling."</p>

<p>As soon as tea was over Mr. Barbecue-Smith excused himself; he
had to do some writing before dinner. Priscilla quite understood.
The prophet retired to his chamber.</p>

<p>Mr. Barbecue-Smith came down to the drawing-room at ten to eight.
He was in a good humour, and, as he descended the stairs, he smiled
to himself and rubbed his large white hands together. In the drawing-room
someone was playing softly and ramblingly on the piano. He wondered
who it could be. One of the young ladies, perhaps. But no, it
was only Denis, who got up hurriedly and with some embarrassment
as he came into the room.</p>

<p>"Do go on, do go on," said Mr. Barbecue-Smith. "I am very fond
of music."</p>

<p>"Then I couldn’t possibly go on," Denis replied. "I only make
noises."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Mr. Barbecue-Smith stood with his back to
the hearth, warming himself at the memory of last winter’s fires.
He could not control his interior satisfaction, but still went
on smiling to himself. At last he turned to Denis.</p>

<p>"You write," he asked, "don’t you?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes&mdash;a little, you know."</p>

<p>"How many words do you find you can write in an hour?"</p>

<p>"I don’t think I’ve ever counted."</p>

<p>"Oh, you ought to, you ought to. It’s most important."</p>

<p>Denis exercised his memory. "When I’m in good form," he said,
"I fancy I do a twelve-hundred-word review in about four hours.
But sometimes it takes me much longer."</p>

<p>Mr. Barbecue-Smith nodded. "Yes, three hundred words an hour
at your best." He walked out into the middle of the room, turned
round on his heels, and confronted Denis again. "Guess how many
words I wrote this evening between five and half-past seven."</p>

<p>"I can’t imagine."</p>

<p>"No, but you must guess. Between five and half-past seven&mdash;that’s
two and a half hours."</p>

<p>"Twelve hundred words," Denis hazarded.</p>

<p>"No, no, no." Mr. Barbecue-Smith’s expanded face shone with gaiety.
"Try again."</p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I give it up," said Denis. He found he couldn’t summon up much
interest in Mr. Barbecue-Smith’s writing.</p>

<p>"Well, I’ll tell you. Three thousand eight hundred."</p>

<p>Denis opened his eyes. "You must get a lot done in a day," he
said.</p>

<p>Mr. Barbecue-Smith suddenly became extremely confidential. He
pulled up a stool to the side of Denis’s arm-chair, sat down in
it, and began to talk softly and rapidly.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," he said, laying his hand on Denis’s sleeve. "You
want to make your living by writing; you’re young, you’re inexperienced.
Let me give you a little sound advice."</p>

<p>What was the fellow going to do? Denis wondered: give him an
introduction to the editor of "John o’ London’s Weekly", or tell
him where he could sell a light middle for seven guineas? Mr.
Barbecue-Smith patted his arm several times and went on.</p>

<p>"The secret of writing," he said, breathing it into the young
man’s ear&mdash;"the secret of writing is Inspiration."</p>

<p>Denis looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Inspiration..." Mr. Barbecue-Smith repeated.</p>

<p>"You mean the native wood-note business?"</p>

<p>Mr. Barbecue-Smith nodded.</p>

<p>"Oh, then I entirely agree with you," said Denis. "But what if
one hasn’t got Inspiration?"</p>

<p>"That was precisely the question I was waiting for," said Mr.
Barbecue-Smith. "You ask me what one should do if one hasn’t got
Inspiration. I answer: you have Inspiration; everyone has Inspiration.
It’s simply a question of getting it to function."</p>

<p>The clock struck eight. There was no sign of any of the other
guests; everybody was always late at Crome. Mr. Barbecue-Smith
went on.</p>

<p>"That’s my secret," he said. "I give it you freely." (Denis made
a suitably grateful murmur and grimace.) "I’ll help you to find
your Inspiration, because I don’t like to see a nice, steady young
man like you exhausting his vitality and wasting the best years
of his life in a grinding intellectual labour that could be completely
obviated by Inspiration. I did it myself, so I know what it’s
like. Up till the time I was thirty-eight I was a writer like
you&mdash;a writer without Inspiration. All I wrote I squeezed out
of myself by sheer hard work. Why, in those days I was never able
to do more than six-fifty words an hour, and what’s more, I often
didn’t sell what I wrote." He sighed. "We artists," he said parenthetically,
"we intellectuals aren’t much appreciated here in England." Denis
wondered if there was any method, consistent, of course, with
politeness, by which he could dissociate himself from Mr. Barbecue-Smith’s
"we." There was none; and besides, it was too late now, for Mr.
Barbecue-Smith was once more pursuing the tenor of his discourse.</p>

<p>"At thirty-eight I was a poor, struggling, tired, overworked,
unknown journalist. Now, at fifty..." He paused modestly and made
a little gesture, moving his fat hands outwards, away from one
another, and expanding his fingers as though in demonstration.
He was exhibiting himself. Denis thought of that advertisement
of Nestle’s milk&mdash;the two cats on the wall, under the moon, one
black and thin, the other white, sleek, and fat. Before Inspiration
and after.</p>

<p>"Inspiration has made the difference," said Mr. Barbecue-Smith
solemnly. "It came quite suddenly&mdash;like a gentle dew from heaven."
He lifted his hand and let it fall back on to his knee to indicate
the descent of the dew. "It was one evening. I was writing my
first little book about the Conduct of Life&mdash;‘Humble Heroisms’.
You may have read it; it has been a comfort&mdash;at least I hope and
think so&mdash;a comfort to many thousands. I was in the middle of
the second chapter, and I was stuck. Fatigue, overwork &mdash;I
had only written a hundred words in the last hour, and I could
get no further. I sat biting the end of my pen and looking at
the electric light, which hung above my table, a little above
and in front of me." He indicated the position of the lamp with
elaborate care. "Have you ever looked at a bright light intently
for a long time?" he asked, turning to Denis. Denis didn’t think
he had. "You can hypnotise yourself that way," Mr. Barbecue-Smith
went on.</p>

<p>The gong sounded in a terrific crescendo from the hall. Still
no sign of the others. Denis was horribly hungry.</p>

<p>"That’s what happened to me," said Mr. Barbecue-Smith. "I was
hypnotised. I lost consciousness like that." He snapped his fingers.
"When I came to, I found that it was past midnight, and I had
written four thousand words. Four thousand," he repeated, opening
his mouth very wide on the "ou" of thousand. "Inspiration had
come to me."</p>

<p>"What a very extraordinary thing," said Denis.</p>

<p>"I was afraid of it at first. It didn’t seem to me natural. I
didn’t feel, somehow, that it was quite right, quite fair, I might
almost say, to produce a literary composition unconsciously. Besides,
I was afraid I might have written nonsense."</p>

<p>"And had you written nonsense?" Denis asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," Mr. Barbecue-Smith replied, with a trace of
annoyance. "Certainly not. It was admirable. Just a few spelling
mistakes and slips, such as there generally are in automatic writing.
But the style, the thought&mdash;all the essentials were admirable.
After that, Inspiration came to me regularly. I wrote the whole
of ‘Humble Heroisms’ like that. It was a great success, and so
has everything been that I have written since." He leaned forward
and jabbed at Denis with his finger. "That’s my secret," he said,
"and that’s how you could write too, if you tried&mdash;without effort,
fluently, well."</p>

<p>"But how?" asked Denis, trying not to show how deeply he had
been insulted by that final "well."</p>

<p>"By cultivating your Inspiration, by getting into touch with
your Subconscious. Have you ever read my little book, ‘Pipe-Lines
to the Infinite’?"</p>

<p>Denis had to confess that that was, precisely, one of the few,
perhaps the only one, of Mr. Barbecue-Smith’s works he had not
read.</p>

<p>"Never mind, never mind," said Mr. Barbecue-Smith. "It’s just
a little book about the connection of the Subconscious with the
Infinite. Get into touch with the Subconscious and you are in
touch with the Universe. Inspiration, in fact. You follow me?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, perfectly," said Denis. "But don’t you find that
the Universe sometimes sends you very irrelevant messages?"</p>

<p>"I don’t allow it to," Mr. Barbecue-Smith replied. "I canalise
it. I bring it down through pipes to work the turbines of my conscious
mind."</p>

<p>"Like Niagara," Denis suggested. Some of Mr. Barbecue-Smith’s
remarks sounded strangely like quotations&mdash;quotations from his
own works, no doubt.</p>

<p>"Precisely. Like Niagara. And this is how I do it." He leaned
forward, and with a raised forefinger marked his points as he
made them, beating time, as it were, to his discourse. "Before
I go off into my trance, I concentrate on the subject I wish to
be inspired about. Let us say I am writing about the humble heroisms;
for ten minutes before I go into the trance I think of nothing
but orphans supporting their little brothers and sisters, of dull
work well and patiently done, and I focus my mind on such great
philosophical truths as the purification and uplifting of the
soul by suffering, and the alchemical transformation of leaden
evil into golden good." (Denis again hung up his little festoon
of quotation marks.) "Then I pop off. Two or three hours later
I wake up again, and find that inspiration has done its work.
Thousands of words, comforting, uplifting words, lie before me.
I type them out neatly on my machine and they are ready for the
printer."</p>

<p>"It all sounds wonderfully simple," said Denis.</p>

<p>"It is. All the great and splendid and divine things of life
are wonderfully simple." (Quotation marks again.) "When I have
to do my aphorisms," Mr. Barbecue-Smith continued, "I prelude
my trance by turning over the pages of any Dictionary of Quotations
or Shakespeare Calendar that comes to hand. That sets the key,
so to speak; that ensures that the Universe shall come flowing
in, not in a continuous rush, but in aphorismic drops. You see
the idea?"</p>

<p>Denis nodded. Mr. Barbecue-Smith put his hand in his pocket and
pulled out a notebook. "I did a few in the train to-day," he said,
turning over the pages. "Just dropped off into a trance in the
corner of my carriage. I find the train very conducive to good
work. Here they are." He cleared his throat and read:</p>

<p>"The Mountain Road may be steep, but the air is pure up there,
and it is from the Summit that one gets the view."</p>

<p>"The Things that Really Matter happen in the Heart."</p>

<p>It was curious, Denis reflected, the way the Infinite sometimes
repeated itself.</p>

<p>"Seeing is Believing. Yes, but Believing is also Seeing. If I
believe in God, I see God, even in the things that seem to be
evil."</p>

<p>Mr. Barbecue-Smith looked up from his notebook. "That last one,"
he said, "is particularly subtle and beautiful, don’t you think?
Without Inspiration I could never have hit on that." He re-read
the apophthegm with a slower and more solemn utterance. "Straight
from the Infinite,"  he commented reflectively, then addressed
himself to the next aphorism.</p>

<p>"The flame of a candle gives Light, but it also Burns."</p>

<p>Puzzled wrinkles appeared on Mr. Barbecue-Smith’s forehead. "I
don’t exactly know what that means," he said. "It’s very gnomic.
One could apply it, of course to the Higher Education&mdash;illuminating,
but provoking the Lower Classes to discontent and revolution.
Yes, I suppose that’s what it is. But it’s gnomic, it’s gnomic."
He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. The gong sounded again, clamorously,
it seemed imploringly: dinner was growing cold. It roused Mr.
Barbecue-Smith from meditation. He turned to Denis.</p>

<p>"You understand me now when I advise you to cultivate your Inspiration.
Let your Subconscious work for you; turn on the Niagara of the
Infinite."</p>

<p>There was the sound of feet on the stairs. Mr. Barbecue-Smith
got up, laid his hand for an instant on Denis’s shoulder, and
said:</p>

<p>"No more now. Another time. And remember, I rely absolutely on
your discretion in this matter. There are intimate, sacred things
that one doesn’t wish to be generally known."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Denis. "I quite understand."</p>
