<p>Half the members of the class passed out to a recitation-room,
the empurpled Victorine among them, and Miss Spence started the
remaining half through the ordeal of trial by mathematics. Several
boys and girls were sent to the blackboard, and Penrod, spared
for the moment, followed their operations a little while with
his eyes, but not with his mind; then, sinking deeper in his seat,
limply abandoned the effort. His eyes remained open, but saw nothing;
the routine of the arithmetic lesson reached his ears in familiar,
meaningless sounds, but he heard nothing; and yet, this time,
he was profoundly occupied. He had drifted away from the painful
land of facts, and floated now in a new sea of fancy which he
had just discovered.</p>

<p>Maturity forgets the marvellous realness of a boy's day-dreams,
how colourful they glow, rosy and living, and how opaque the curtain
closing down between the dreamer and the actual world. That curtain
is almost sound-proof, too, and causes more throat-trouble among
parents than is suspected.</p>

<p>The nervous monotony of the schoolroom inspires a sometimes unbearable
longing for something astonishing to happen, and as every boy's
fundamental desire is to do something astonishing himself, so
as to be the centre of all human interest and awe, it was natural
that Penrod should discover in fancy the delightful secret of
self-levitation. He found, in this curious series of imaginings,
during the lesson in arithmetic, that the atmosphere may be navigated
as by a swimmer under water, but with infinitely greater ease
and with perfect comfort in breathing. In his mind he extended
his arms gracefully, at a level with his shoulders, and delicately
paddled the air with his hands, which at once caused him to be
drawn up out of his seat and elevated gently to a position about
midway between the floor and the ceiling, where he came to an
equilibrium and floated; a sensation not the less exquisite because
of the screams of his fellow pupils, appalled by the miracle.
Miss Spence herself was amazed and frightened, but he only smiled
down carelessly upon her when she commanded him to return to earth;
and then, when she climbed upon a desk to pull him down, he quietly
paddled himself a little higher, leaving his toes just out of
her reach. Next, he swam through a few slow somersaults to show
his mastery of the new art, and, with the shouting of the dumfounded
scholars ringing in his ears, turned on his side and floated swiftly
out of the window, immediately rising above the housetops, while
people in the street below him shrieked, and a trolley car stopped
dead in wonder.</p>

<p>With almost no exertion he paddled himself, many yards at a stroke,
to the girls' private school where Marjorie Jones was a pupil
&mdash;Marjorie Jones of the amber curls and the golden voice!
Long before the "Pageant of the Table Round," she had offered
Penrod a hundred proofs that she considered him wholly undesirable
and ineligible. At the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class she consistently
incited and led the laughter at him whenever Professor Bartet
singled him out for admonition in matters of feet and decorum.
And but yesterday she had chid him for his slavish lack of memory
in daring to offer her a greeting on the way to Sunday-school.
"Well! I expect you must forgot I told you never to speak to me
again! If I was a boy, I'd be too proud to come hanging around
people that don't speak to me, even if I <em>WAS </em>the Worst
Boy in Town!"  So she flouted him. But now, as he floated in through
the window of her classroom and swam gently along the ceiling
like an escaped toy balloon, she fell upon her knees beside her
little desk, and, lifting up her arms toward him, cried with love
and admiration:</p>

<p>"Oh, PENrod!"</p>

<p>He negligently kicked a globe from the high chandelier, and,
smiling coldly, floated out through the hall to the front steps
of the school, while Marjorie followed, imploring him to grant
her one kind look.</p>

<p>In the street an enormous crowd had gathered, headed by Miss
Spence and a brass band; and a cheer from a hundred thousand throats
shook the very ground as Penrod swam overhead. Marjorie knelt
upon the steps and watched adoringly while Penrod took the drum-major's
baton and, performing sinuous evolutions above the crowd, led
the band. Then he threw the baton so high that it disappeared
from sight; but he went swiftly after it, a double delight, for
he had not only the delicious sensation of rocketing safely up
and up into the blue sky, but also that of standing in the crowd
below, watching and admiring himself as he dwindled to a speck,
disappeared and then, emerging from a cloud, came speeding down,
with the baton in his hand, to the level of the treetops, where
he beat time for the band and the vast throng and Marjorie Jones,
who all united in the "Star-spangled Banner" in honour of his
aerial achievements. It was a great moment.</p>

<p>It was a great moment, but something seemed to threaten it. The
face of Miss Spence looking up from the crowd grew too vivid&mdash;unpleasantly
vivid. She was beckoning him and shouting, "Come down, Penrod
Schofield! Penrod Schofield, come down here!"</p>

<p>He could hear her above the band and the singing of the multitude;
she seemed intent on spoiling everything. Marjorie Jones was weeping
to show how sorry she was that she had formerly slighted him,
and throwing kisses to prove that she loved him; but Miss Spence
kept jumping between him and Marjorie, incessantly calling his
name.</p>

<p>He grew more and more irritated with her; he was the most important
person in the world and was engaged in proving it to Marjorie
Jones and the whole city, and yet Miss Spence seemed to feel she
still had the right to order him about as she did in the old days
when he was an ordinary schoolboy. He was furious; he was sure
she wanted him to do something disagreeable. It seemed to him
that she had screamed "Penrod Schofield!" thousands of times.</p>

<p>From the beginning of his aerial experiments in his own schoolroom,
he had not opened his lips, knowing somehow that one of the requirements
for air floating is perfect silence on the part of the floater;
but, finally, irritated beyond measure by Miss Spence's clamorous
insistence, he was unable to restrain an indignant rebuke and
immediately came to earth with a frightful bump.</p>

<p>Miss Spence&mdash;in the flesh&mdash;had directed toward the physical body
of the absent Penrod an inquiry as to the fractional consequences
of dividing seventeen apples, fairly, among three boys, and she
was surprised and displeased to receive no answer although to
the best of her knowledge and belief, he was looking fixedly at
her. She repeated her question crisply, without visible effect;
then summoned him by name with increasing asperity. Twice she
called him, while all his fellow pupils turned to stare at the
gazing boy. She advanced a step from the platform.</p>

<p>"Penrod Schofield!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness!" he shouted suddenly. "Can't you keep still
a <em>MINUTE</em>?"</p>
