 <BR>
<BR>
  Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit <BR>
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast <BR>
Brought Death into the World, and all our woe, <BR>
With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man <BR>
Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat, <BR>
Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top <BR>
Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire <BR>
That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed, <BR>
In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth <BR>
Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill <BR>
Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd <BR>
Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence <BR>
Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song, <BR>
That with no middle flight intends to soar <BR>
Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues <BR>
Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime. <BR>
And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer <BR>
Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure, <BR>
Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first <BR>
Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread <BR>
Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss <BR>
And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark <BR>
Illumine, what is low raise and support; <BR>
That to the highth of this great Argument <BR>
I may assert th' Eternal Providence, <BR>
And justifie the wayes of God to men. <BR>
<BR>
  Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view <BR>
Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause <BR>
Mov'd our Grand Parents in that happy State, <BR>
Favour'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall off <BR>
From their Creator, and transgress his Will <BR>
For one restraint, Lords of the World besides? <BR>
Who first seduc'd them to that fowl revolt? <BR>
Th' infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile <BR>
Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv'd <BR>
The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride <BR>
Had cast him out from Heav'n, with all his Host <BR>
Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring <BR>
To set himself in Glory above his Peers, <BR>
He trusted to have equal'd the most High, <BR>
If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim <BR>
Against the Throne and Monarchy of God <BR>
Rais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battel proud <BR>
With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power <BR>
Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie <BR>
With hideous ruine and combustion down <BR>
To bottomless perdition, there to dwell <BR>
In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire, <BR>
Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms. <BR>
Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night <BR>
To mortal men, he with his horrid crew <BR>
Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe <BR>
Confounded though immortal: But his doom <BR>
Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought <BR>
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain <BR>
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes <BR>
That witness'd huge affliction and dismay <BR>
Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate: <BR>
At once as far as Angels kenn he views <BR>
The dismal Situation waste and wilde, <BR>
A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round <BR>
As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames <BR>
No light, but rather darkness visible <BR>
Serv'd only to discover sights of woe, <BR>
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace <BR>
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes <BR>
That comes to all; but torture without end <BR>
Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed <BR>
With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd: <BR>
Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd <BR>
For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain'd <BR>
In utter darkness, and their portion set <BR>
As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n <BR>
As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole. <BR>
O how unlike the place from whence they fell! <BR>
There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd <BR>
With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, <BR>
He soon discerns, and weltring by his side <BR>
One next himself in power, and next in crime, <BR>
Long after known in PALESTINE, and nam'd <BR>
BEELZEBUB.  To whom th' Arch-Enemy, <BR>
And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words <BR>
Breaking the horrid silence thus began. <BR>
<BR>
  If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd <BR>
From him, who in the happy Realms of Light <BR>
Cloth'd with transcendent brightnes didst outshine <BR>
Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league, <BR>
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope, <BR>
And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize, <BR>
Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd <BR>
In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest <BR>
From what highth fal'n, so much the stronger provd <BR>
He with his Thunder: and till then who knew <BR>
The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those <BR>
Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage <BR>
Can else inflict do I repent or change, <BR>
Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind <BR>
And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit, <BR>
That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend, <BR>
And to the fierce contention brought along <BR>
Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd <BR>
That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring, <BR>
His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd <BR>
In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n, <BR>
And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost? <BR>
All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, <BR>
And study of revenge, immortal hate, <BR>
And courage never to submit or yield: <BR>
And what is else not to be overcome? <BR>
That Glory never shall his wrath or might <BR>
Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace <BR>
With suppliant knee, and deifie his power <BR>
Who from the terrour of this Arm so late <BR>
Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed, <BR>
That were an ignominy and shame beneath <BR>
This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods <BR>
And this Empyreal substance cannot fail, <BR>
Since through experience of this great event <BR>
In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't, <BR>
We may with more successful hope resolve <BR>
To wage by force or guile eternal Warr <BR>
Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe, <BR>
Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy <BR>
Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain, <BR>
Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare: <BR>
And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer. <BR>
<BR>
  O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers, <BR>
That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr <BR>
Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds <BR>
Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King; <BR>
And put to proof his high Supremacy, <BR>
Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate, <BR>
Too well I see and rue the dire event, <BR>
That with sad overthrow and foul defeat <BR>
Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host <BR>
In horrible destruction laid thus low, <BR>
As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences <BR>
Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains <BR>
Invincible, and vigour soon returns, <BR>
Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state <BR>
Here swallow'd up in endless misery. <BR>
But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now <BR>
Of force believe Almighty, since no less <BR>
Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours) <BR>
Have left us this our spirit and strength intire <BR>
Strongly to suffer and support our pains, <BR>
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, <BR>
Or do him mightier service as his thralls <BR>
By right of Warr, what e're his business be <BR>
Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire, <BR>
Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep; <BR>
What can it then avail though yet we feel <BR>
Strength undiminisht, or eternal being <BR>
To undergo eternal punishment? <BR>
Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable <BR>
Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure, <BR>
To do ought good never will be our task, <BR>
But ever to do ill our sole delight, <BR>
As being the contrary to his high will <BR>
Whom we resist.  If then his Providence <BR>
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, <BR>
Our labour must be to pervert that end, <BR>
And out of good still to find means of evil; <BR>
Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps <BR>
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb <BR>
His inmost counsels from their destind aim. <BR>
But see the angry Victor hath recall'd <BR>
His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit <BR>
Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail <BR>
Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid <BR>
The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice <BR>
Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder, <BR>
Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage, <BR>
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now <BR>
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. <BR>
Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn, <BR>
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. <BR>
Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, <BR>
The seat of desolation, voyd of light, <BR>
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames <BR>
Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend <BR>
From off the tossing of these fiery waves, <BR>
There rest, if any rest can harbour there, <BR>
And reassembling our afflicted Powers, <BR>
Consult how we may henceforth most offend <BR>
Our Enemy, our own loss how repair, <BR>
How overcome this dire Calamity, <BR>
What reinforcement we may gain from Hope, <BR>
If not what resolution from despare. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate <BR>
With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes <BR>
That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides <BR>
Prone on the Flood, extended long and large <BR>
Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge <BR>
As whom the Fables name of monstrous size, <BR>
TITANIAN, or EARTH-BORN, that warr'd on JOVE, <BR>
BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den <BR>
By ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beast <BR>
LEVIATHAN, which God of all his works <BR>
Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream: <BR>
Him haply slumbring on the NORWAY foam <BR>
The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff, <BR>
Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell, <BR>
With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind <BR>
Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night <BR>
Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes: <BR>
So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay <BR>
Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence <BR>
Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will <BR>
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven <BR>
Left him at large to his own dark designs, <BR>
That with reiterated crimes he might <BR>
Heap on himself damnation, while he sought <BR>
Evil to others, and enrag'd might see <BR>
How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth <BR>
Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn <BR>
On Man by him seduc't, but on himself <BR>
Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd. <BR>
Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool <BR>
His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames <BR>
Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, &amp; rowld <BR>
In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale. <BR>
Then with expanded wings he stears his flight <BR>
Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air <BR>
That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land <BR>
He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd <BR>
With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire; <BR>
And such appear'd in hue, as when the force <BR>
Of subterranean wind transports a Hill <BR>
Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter'd side <BR>
Of thundring AETNA, whose combustible <BR>
And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire, <BR>
Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds, <BR>
And leave a singed bottom all involv'd <BR>
With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole <BR>
Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate, <BR>
Both glorying to have scap't the STYGIAN flood <BR>
As Gods, and by their own recover'd strength, <BR>
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power. <BR>
<BR>
  Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime, <BR>
Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat <BR>
That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom <BR>
For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee <BR>
Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid <BR>
What shall be right: fardest from him is best <BR>
Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream <BR>
Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields <BR>
Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail <BR>
Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell <BR>
Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings <BR>
A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time. <BR>
The mind is its own place, and in it self <BR>
Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n. <BR>
What matter where, if I be still the same, <BR>
And what I should be, all but less then hee <BR>
Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least <BR>
We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built <BR>
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: <BR>
Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce <BR>
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: <BR>
Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n. <BR>
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, <BR>
Th' associates and copartners of our loss <BR>
Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool, <BR>
And call them not to share with us their part <BR>
In this unhappy Mansion, or once more <BR>
With rallied Arms to try what may be yet <BR>
Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell? <BR>
<BR>
  So SATAN spake, and him BEELZEBUB <BR>
Thus answer'd.  Leader of those Armies bright, <BR>
Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld, <BR>
If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge <BR>
Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft <BR>
In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge <BR>
Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults <BR>
Their surest signal, they will soon resume <BR>
New courage and revive, though now they lye <BR>
Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, <BR>
As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd, <BR>
No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth. <BR>
<BR>
  He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend <BR>
Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield <BR>
Ethereal temper, massy, large and round, <BR>
Behind him cast; the broad circumference <BR>
Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb <BR>
Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views <BR>
At Ev'ning from the top of FESOLE, <BR>
Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands, <BR>
Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. <BR>
His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine <BR>
Hewn on NORWEGIAN hills, to be the Mast <BR>
Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, <BR>
He walkt with to support uneasie steps <BR>
Over the burning Marle, not like those steps <BR>
On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime <BR>
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire; <BR>
Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach <BR>
Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd <BR>
His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't <BR>
Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks <BR>
In VALLOMBROSA, where th' ETRURIAN shades <BR>
High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge <BR>
Afloat, when with fierce Winds ORION arm'd <BR>
Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew <BR>
BUSIRIS and his MEMPHIAN Chivalrie, <BR>
VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu'd <BR>
The Sojourners of GOSHEN, who beheld <BR>
From the safe shore their floating Carkases <BR>
And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown <BR>
Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood, <BR>
Under amazement of their hideous change. <BR>
He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep <BR>
Of Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates, <BR>
Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost, <BR>
If such astonishment as this can sieze <BR>
Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place <BR>
After the toyl of Battel to repose <BR>
Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find <BR>
To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n? <BR>
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn <BR>
To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds <BR>
Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood <BR>
With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon <BR>
His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern <BR>
Th' advantage, and descending tread us down <BR>
Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts <BR>
Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe. <BR>
Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n. <BR>
<BR>
  They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung <BR>
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch <BR>
On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, <BR>
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. <BR>
Nor did they not perceave the evil plight <BR>
In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; <BR>
Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd <BR>
Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod <BR>
Of AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evill day <BR>
Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud <BR>
Of LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind, <BR>
That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hung <BR>
Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of NILE: <BR>
So numberless were those bad Angels seen <BR>
Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell <BR>
'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires; <BR>
Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear <BR>
Of their great Sultan waving to direct <BR>
Thir course, in even ballance down they light <BR>
On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain; <BR>
A multitude, like which the populous North <BR>
Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass <BR>
RHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous Sons <BR>
Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread <BR>
Beneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands. <BR>
Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band <BR>
The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood <BR>
Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms <BR>
Excelling human, Princely Dignities, <BR>
And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones; <BR>
Though of their Names in heav'nly Records now <BR>
Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd <BR>
By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life. <BR>
Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVE <BR>
Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth, <BR>
Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man, <BR>
By falsities and lyes the greatest part <BR>
Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake <BR>
God their Creator, and th' invisible <BR>
Glory of him, that made them, to transform <BR>
Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd <BR>
With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold, <BR>
And Devils to adore for Deities: <BR>
Then were they known to men by various Names, <BR>
And various Idols through the Heathen World. <BR>
Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last, <BR>
Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch, <BR>
At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth <BR>
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand, <BR>
While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? <BR>
The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell <BR>
Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix <BR>
Their Seats long after next the Seat of God, <BR>
Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd <BR>
Among the Nations round, and durst abide <BR>
JEHOVAH thundring out of SION, thron'd <BR>
Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd <BR>
Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines, <BR>
Abominations; and with cursed things <BR>
His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd, <BR>
And with their darkness durst affront his light. <BR>
First MOLOCH, horrid King besmear'd with blood <BR>
Of human sacrifice, and parents tears, <BR>
Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud <BR>
Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire <BR>
To his grim Idol.  Him the AMMONITE <BR>
Worshipt in RABBA and her watry Plain, <BR>
In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream <BR>
Of utmost ARNON.  Nor content with such <BR>
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart <BR>
Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build <BR>
His Temple right against the Temple of God <BR>
On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove <BR>
The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence <BR>
And black GEHENNA call'd, the Type of Hell. <BR>
Next CHEMOS, th' obscene dread of MOABS Sons, <BR>
From AROER to NEBO, and the wild <BR>
Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBON <BR>
And HERONAIM, SEONS Realm, beyond <BR>
The flowry Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines, <BR>
And ELEALE to th' ASPHALTICK Pool. <BR>
PEOR his other Name, when he entic'd <BR>
ISRAEL in SITTIM on their march from NILE <BR>
To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. <BR>
Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd <BR>
Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove <BR>
Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate; <BR>
Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell. <BR>
With these came they, who from the bordring flood <BR>
Of old EUPHRATES to the Brook that parts <BR>
EGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general Names <BR>
Of BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male, <BR>
These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please <BR>
Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft <BR>
And uncompounded is their Essence pure, <BR>
Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb, <BR>
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, <BR>
Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose <BR>
Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure, <BR>
Can execute their aerie purposes, <BR>
And works of love or enmity fulfill. <BR>
For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook <BR>
Their living strength, and unfrequented left <BR>
His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down <BR>
To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low <BR>
Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear <BR>
Of despicable foes.  With these in troop <BR>
Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call'd <BR>
ASTARTE, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns; <BR>
To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon <BR>
SIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs, <BR>
In SION also not unsung, where stood <BR>
Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built <BR>
By that uxorious King, whose heart though large, <BR>
Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell <BR>
To Idols foul.  THAMMUZ came next behind, <BR>
Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur'd <BR>
The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate <BR>
In amorous dittyes all a Summers day, <BR>
While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock <BR>
Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood <BR>
Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale <BR>
Infected SIONS daughters with like heat, <BR>
Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch <BR>
EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led <BR>
His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries <BR>
Of alienated JUDAH.  Next came one <BR>
Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark <BR>
Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off <BR>
In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge, <BR>
Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers: <BR>
DAGON his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man <BR>
And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high <BR>
Rear'd in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast <BR>
Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON, <BR>
And ACCARON and GAZA's frontier bounds. <BR>
Him follow'd RIMMON, whose delightful Seat <BR>
Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertil Banks <BR>
Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams. <BR>
He also against the house of God was bold: <BR>
A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King, <BR>
AHAZ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew <BR>
Gods Altar to disparage and displace <BR>
For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn <BR>
His odious offrings, and adore the Gods <BR>
Whom he had vanquisht.  After these appear'd <BR>
A crew who under Names of old Renown, <BR>
OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train <BR>
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd <BR>
Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek <BR>
Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms <BR>
Rather then human.  Nor did ISRAEL scape <BR>
Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd <BR>
The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King <BR>
Doubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN, <BR>
Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox, <BR>
JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass'd <BR>
From EGYPT marching, equal'd with one stroke <BR>
Both her first born and all her bleating Gods. <BR>
BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd <BR>
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love <BR>
Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood <BR>
Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee <BR>
In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest <BR>
Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd <BR>
With lust and violence the house of God. <BR>
In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns <BR>
And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse <BR>
Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs, <BR>
And injury and outrage: And when Night <BR>
Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons <BR>
Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine. <BR>
Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night <BR>
In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores <BR>
Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape. <BR>
These were the prime in order and in might; <BR>
The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd, <BR>
Th' IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held <BR>
Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth <BR>
Thir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav'ns first born <BR>
With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd <BR>
By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVE <BR>
His own and RHEA'S Son like measure found; <BR>
So JOVE usurping reign'd: these first in CREET <BR>
And IDA known, thence on the Snowy top <BR>
Of cold OLYMPUS rul'd the middle Air <BR>
Thir highest Heav'n; or on the DELPHIAN Cliff, <BR>
Or in DODONA, and through all the bounds <BR>
Of DORIC Land; or who with SATURN old <BR>
Fled over ADRIA to th' HESPERIAN Fields, <BR>
And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles. <BR>
All these and more came flocking; but with looks <BR>
Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd <BR>
Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief <BR>
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost <BR>
In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast <BR>
Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride <BR>
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore <BR>
Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd <BR>
Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears. <BR>
Then strait commands that at the warlike sound <BR>
Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard <BR>
His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd <BR>
AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall: <BR>
Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld <BR>
Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't <BR>
Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind <BR>
With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd, <BR>
Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while <BR>
Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds: <BR>
At which the universal Host upsent <BR>
A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond <BR>
Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night. <BR>
All in a moment through the gloom were seen <BR>
Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air <BR>
With Orient Colours waving: with them rose <BR>
A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms <BR>
Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array <BR>
Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move <BR>
In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood <BR>
Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd <BR>
To highth of noblest temper Hero's old <BR>
Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage <BR>
Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd <BR>
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat, <BR>
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage <BR>
With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase <BR>
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain <BR>
From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they <BR>
Breathing united force with fixed thought <BR>
Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd <BR>
Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now <BR>
Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front <BR>
Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise <BR>
Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield, <BR>
Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief <BR>
Had to impose: He through the armed Files <BR>
Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse <BR>
The whole Battalion views, thir order due, <BR>
Thir visages and stature as of Gods, <BR>
Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart <BR>
Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength <BR>
Glories: For never since created man, <BR>
Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these <BR>
Could merit more then that small infantry <BR>
Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood <BR>
Of PHLEGRA with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd <BR>
That fought at THEB'S and ILIUM, on each side <BR>
Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds <BR>
In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son <BR>
Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights; <BR>
And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel <BR>
Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN, <BR>
DAMASCO, or MAROCCO, or TREBISOND, <BR>
Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore <BR>
When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell <BR>
By FONTARABBIA.  Thus far these beyond <BR>
Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd <BR>
Thir dread Commander: he above the rest <BR>
In shape and gesture proudly eminent <BR>
Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost <BR>
All her Original brightness, nor appear'd <BR>
Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess <BR>
Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n <BR>
Looks through the Horizontal misty Air <BR>
Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon <BR>
In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds <BR>
On half the Nations, and with fear of change <BR>
Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark'n'd so, yet shon <BR>
Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face <BR>
Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care <BR>
Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes <BR>
Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride <BR>
Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast <BR>
Signs of remorse and passion to behold <BR>
The fellows of his crime, the followers rather <BR>
(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd <BR>
For ever now to have their lot in pain, <BR>
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't <BR>
Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung <BR>
For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood, <BR>
Thir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire <BR>
Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines, <BR>
With singed top their stately growth though bare <BR>
Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar'd <BR>
To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend <BR>
From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round <BR>
With all his Peers: attention held them mute. <BR>
Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn, <BR>
Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last <BR>
Words interwove with sighs found out their way. <BR>
<BR>
  O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers <BR>
Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife <BR>
Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire, <BR>
As this place testifies, and this dire change <BR>
Hateful to utter: but what power of mind <BR>
Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth <BR>
Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd, <BR>
How such united force of Gods, how such <BR>
As stood like these, could ever know repulse? <BR>
For who can yet beleeve, though after loss, <BR>
That all these puissant Legions, whose exile <BR>
Hath emptied Heav'n, shall faile to re-ascend <BR>
Self-rais'd, and repossess their native seat. <BR>
For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n, <BR>
If counsels different, or danger shun'd <BR>
By me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns <BR>
Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure <BR>
Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, <BR>
Consent or custome, and his Regal State <BR>
Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd, <BR>
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. <BR>
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own <BR>
So as not either to provoke, or dread <BR>
New warr, provok't; our better part remains <BR>
To work in close design, by fraud or guile <BR>
What force effected not: that he no less <BR>
At length from us may find, who overcomes <BR>
By force, hath overcome but half his foe. <BR>
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife <BR>
There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long <BR>
Intended to create, and therein plant <BR>
A generation, whom his choice regard <BR>
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven: <BR>
Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps <BR>
Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere: <BR>
For this Infernal Pit shall never hold <BR>
Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abysse <BR>
Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts <BR>
Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, <BR>
For who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr <BR>
Open or understood must be resolv'd. <BR>
<BR>
  He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew <BR>
Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs <BR>
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze <BR>
Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd <BR>
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's <BR>
Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war, <BR>
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n. <BR>
<BR>
  There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top <BR>
Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire <BR>
Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign <BR>
That in his womb was hid metallic Ore, <BR>
The work of Sulphur.  Thither wing'd with speed <BR>
A numerous Brigad hasten'd.  As when bands <BR>
Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm'd <BR>
Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field, <BR>
Or cast a Rampart.  MAMMON led them on, <BR>
MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fell <BR>
From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks &amp; thoughts <BR>
Were always downward bent, admiring more <BR>
The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold, <BR>
Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd <BR>
In vision beatific: by him first <BR>
Men also, and by his suggestion taught, <BR>
Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands <BR>
Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth <BR>
For Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew <BR>
Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound <BR>
And dig'd out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire <BR>
That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best <BR>
Deserve the pretious bane.  And here let those <BR>
Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell <BR>
Of BABEL, and the works of MEMPHIAN Kings, <BR>
Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, <BR>
And Strength and Art are easily outdone <BR>
By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour <BR>
What in an age they with incessant toyle <BR>
And hands innumerable scarce perform <BR>
Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd, <BR>
That underneath had veins of liquid fire <BR>
Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude <BR>
With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore, <BR>
Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross: <BR>
A third as soon had form'd within the ground <BR>
A various mould, and from the boyling cells <BR>
By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook, <BR>
As in an Organ from one blast of wind <BR>
To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. <BR>
Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge <BR>
Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound <BR>
Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, <BR>
Built like a Temple, where PILASTERS round <BR>
Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid <BR>
With Golden Architrave; nor did there want <BR>
Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n, <BR>
The Roof was fretted Gold.  Not BABILON, <BR>
Nor great ALCAIRO such magnificence <BR>
Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine <BR>
BELUS or SERAPIS thir Gods, or seat <BR>
Thir Kings, when AEGYPT with ASSYRIA strove <BR>
In wealth and luxurie.  Th' ascending pile <BR>
Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores <BR>
Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide <BR>
Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth <BR>
And level pavement: from the arched roof <BR>
Pendant by suttle Magic many a row <BR>
Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed <BR>
With Naphtha and ASPHALTUS yeilded light <BR>
As from a sky.  The hasty multitude <BR>
Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise <BR>
And some the Architect: his hand was known <BR>
In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high, <BR>
Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence, <BR>
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King <BR>
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, <BR>
Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright. <BR>
Nor was his name unheard or unador'd <BR>
In ancient Greece; and in AUSONIAN land <BR>
Men call'd him MULCIBER; and how he fell <BR>
From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry JOVE <BR>
Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn <BR>
To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve, <BR>
A Summers day; and with the setting Sun <BR>
Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, <BR>
On LEMNOS th' AEGAEAN Ile: thus they relate, <BR>
Erring; for he with this rebellious rout <BR>
Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now <BR>
To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape <BR>
By all his Engins, but was headlong sent <BR>
With his industrious crew to build in hell. <BR>
Mean while the winged Haralds by command <BR>
Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony <BR>
And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim <BR>
A solemn Councel forthwith to be held <BR>
At PANDAEMONIUM, the high Capital <BR>
Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd <BR>
From every and Band squared Regiment <BR>
By place or choice the worthiest; they anon <BR>
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came <BR>
Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates <BR>
And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall <BR>
(Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold <BR>
Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair <BR>
Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry <BR>
To mortal combat or carreer with Lance) <BR>
Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air, <BR>
Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.  As Bees <BR>
In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, <BR>
Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive <BR>
In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers <BR>
Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, <BR>
The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, <BR>
New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer <BR>
Thir State affairs.  So thick the aerie crowd <BR>
Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n, <BR>
Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd <BR>
In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons <BR>
Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room <BR>
Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race <BR>
Beyond the INDIAN Mount, or Faerie Elves, <BR>
Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side <BR>
Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees, <BR>
Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon <BR>
Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth <BR>
Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth &amp; dance <BR>
Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear; <BR>
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. <BR>
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms <BR>
Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large, <BR>
Though without number still amidst the Hall <BR>
Of that infernal Court.  But far within <BR>
And in thir own dimensions like themselves <BR>
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim <BR>
In close recess and secret conclave sat <BR>
A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's, <BR>
Frequent and full.  After short silence then <BR>
And summons read, the great consult began. <BR>
