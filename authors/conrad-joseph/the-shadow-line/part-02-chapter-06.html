<p>As we all went up it occurred to me that there ought to be a
man at the helm. I raised my voice not much above a whisper, and,
noiselessly, an uncomplaining spirit in a fever-wasted body appeared
in the light aft, the head with hollow eyes illuminated against
the blackness which had swallowed up our world&mdash;and the universe.
The bared forearm extended over the upper spokes seemed to shine
with a light of its own.</p>

<p>I murmured to that luminous appearance:</p>

<p>"Keep the helm right amidships."</p>

<p>It answered in a tone of patient suffering:</p>

<p>"Right amidships, sir."</p>

<p>Then I descended to the quarter-deck. It was impossible to tell
whence the blow would come. To look round the ship was to look
into a bottomless, black pit. The eye lost itself in inconceivable
depths.</p>

<p>I wanted to ascertain whether the ropes had been picked up off
the deck. One could only do that by feeling with one’s feet. In
my cautious progress I came against a man in whom I recognized
Ransome. He possessed an unimpaired physical solidity which was
manifest to me at the contact. He was leaning against the quarter-deck
capstan and kept silent. It was like a revelation. He was the
collapsed figure sobbing for breath I had noticed before we went
on the poop.</p>

<p>"You have been helping with the mainsail!" I exclaimed in a low
tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," sounded his quiet voice.</p>

<p>"Man! What were you thinking of? You mustn’t do that sort of
thing."</p>

<p>After a pause he assented: "I suppose I mustn’t." Then after
another short silence he added: "I am all right now," quickly,
between the tell-tale gasps.</p>

<p>I could neither hear nor see anybody else; but when I spoke up,
answering sad murmurs filled the quarter-deck, and its shadows
seemed to shift here and there. I ordered all the halyards laid
down on deck clear for running.</p>

<p>"I’ll see to that, sir," volunteered Ransome in his natural,
pleasant tone, which comforted one and aroused one’s compassion,
too, somehow.</p>

<p>That man ought to have been in his bed, resting, and my plain
duty was to send him there. But perhaps he would not have obeyed
me; I had not the strength of mind to try. All I said was:</p>

<p>"Go about it quietly, Ransome."</p>

<p>Returning on the poop I approached Gambril. His face, set with
hollow shadows in the light, looked awful, finally silenced. I
asked him how he felt, but hardly expected an answer. Therefore,
I was astonished at his comparative loquacity.</p>

<p>"Them shakes leaves me as weak as a kitten, sir," he said, preserving
finely that air of unconsciousness as to anything but his business
a helmsman should never lose. "And before I can pick up my strength
that there hot fit comes along and knocks me over again."</p>

<p>He sighed. There was no reproach in his tone, but the bare words
were enough to give me a horrible pang of self-reproach. It held
me dumb for a time. When the tormenting sensation had passed off
I asked:</p>

<p>"Do you feel strong enough to prevent the rudder taking charge
if she gets sternway on her? It wouldn’t do to get something smashed
about the steering-gear now. We’ve enough difficulties to cope
with as it is."</p>

<p>He answered with just a shade of weariness that he was strong
enough to hang on. He could promise me that she shouldn’t take
the wheel out of his hands. More he couldn’t say.</p>

<p>At that moment Ransome appeared quite close to me, stepping out
of the darkness into visibility suddenly, as if just created with
his composed face and pleasant voice.</p>

<p>Every rope on deck, he said, was laid down clear for running,
as far as one could make certain by feeling. It was impossible
to see anything. Frenchy had stationed himself forward. He said
he had a jump or two left in him yet.</p>

<p>Here a faint smile altered for an instant the clear, firm design
of Ransome’s lips. With his serious clear, gray eyes, his serene
temperament&mdash;he was a priceless man altogether. Soul as firm as
the muscles of his body.</p>

<p>He was the only man on board (except me, but I had to preserve
my liberty of movement) who had a sufficiency of muscular strength
to trust to. For a moment I thought I had better ask him to take
the wheel. But the dreadful knowledge of the enemy he had to carry
about him made me hesitate. In my ignorance of physiology it occurred
to me that he might die suddenly, from excitement, at a critical
moment.</p>

<p>While this gruesome fear restrained the ready words on the tip
of my tongue, Ransome stepped back two paces and vanished from
my sight.</p>

<p>At once an uneasiness possessed me, as if some support had been
withdrawn. I moved forward, too, outside the circle of light,
into the darkness that stood in front of me like a wall. In one
stride I penetrated it. Such must have been the darkness before
creation. It had closed behind me. I knew I was invisible to the
man at the helm. Neither could I see anything. He was alone, I
was alone, every man was alone where he stood. And every form
was gone too, spar, sail, fittings, rails; everything was blotted
out in the dreadful smoothness of that absolute night.</p>

<p>A flash of lightning would have been a relief &mdash;I mean physically.
I would have prayed for it if it hadn’t been for my shrinking
apprehension of the thunder. In the tension of silence I was suffering
from it seemed to me that the first crash must turn me into dust.</p>

<p>And thunder was, most likely, what would happen next. Stiff all
over and hardly breathing, I waited with a horribly strained expectation.
Nothing happened. It was maddening, but a dull, growing ache in
the lower part of my face made me aware that I had been grinding
my teeth madly enough, for God knows how long.</p>

<p>It’s extraordinary I should not have heard myself doing it; but
I hadn’t. By an effort which absorbed all my faculties I managed
to keep my jaw still. It required much attention, and while thus
engaged I became bothered by curious, irregular sounds of faint
tapping on the deck. They could be heard single, in pairs, in
groups. While I wondered at this mysterious devilry, I received
a slight blow under the left eye and felt an enormous tear run
down my cheek. Raindrops. Enormous. Forerunners of something.
Tap. Tap. Tap. . . .</p>

<p>I turned about, and, addressing Gambrel earnestly, entreated
him to "hang on to the wheel." But I could hardly speak from emotion.
The fatal moment had come. I held my breath. The tapping had stopped
as unexpectedly as it had begun, and there was a renewed moment
of intolerable suspense; something like an additional turn of
the racking screw. I don’t suppose I would have ever screamed,
but I remember my conviction that there was nothing else for it
but to scream.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;how am I to convey it? Well, suddenly the darkness
turned into water. This is the only suitable figure. A heavy shower,
a downpour, comes along, making a noise. You hear its approach
on the sea, in the air, too, I verily believe. But this was different.
With no preliminary whisper or rustle, without a splash, and even
without the ghost of impact, I became instantaneously soaked to
the skin. Not a very difficult matter, since I was wearing only
my sleeping suit. My hair got full of water in an instant, water
streamed on my skin, it filled my nose, my ears, my eyes. In a
fraction of a second I swallowed quite a lot of it.</p>

<p>As to Gambril, he was fairly choked. He coughed pitifully, the
broken cough of a sick man; and I beheld him as one sees a fish
in an aquarium by the light of an electric bulb, an elusive, phosphorescent
shape. Only he did not glide away. But something else happened.
Both binnaclelamps went out. I suppose the water forced itself
into them, though I wouldn’t have thought that possible, for they
fitted into the cowl perfectly.</p>

<p>The last gleam of light in the universe had gone, pursued by
a low exclamation of dismay from Gambril. I groped for him and
seized his arm. How startlingly wasted it was.</p>

<p>"Never mind," I said. "You don’t want the light. All you need
to do is to keep the wind, when it comes, at the back of your
head. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir. . . . But I should like to have a light," he
added nervously.</p>

<p>All that time the ship lay as steady as a rock. The noise of
the water pouring off the sails and spars, flowing over the break
of the poop, had stopped short. The poop scuppers gurgled and
sobbed for a little while longer, and then perfect silence, joined
to perfect immobility, proclaimed the yet unbroken spell of our
helplessness, poised on the edge of some violent issue, lurking
in the dark.</p>

<p>I started forward restlessly. I did not need my sight to pace
the poop of my ill-starred first command with perfect assurance.
Every square foot of her decks was impressed indelibly on my brain,
to the very grain and knots of the planks. Yet, all of a sudden,
I fell clean over something, landing full length on my hands and
face.</p>

<p>It was something big and alive. Not a dog&mdash;more like a sheep,
rather. But there were no animals in the ship. How could an animal.
. . . It was an added and fantastic horror which I could not resist.
The hair of my head stirred even as I picked myself up, awfully
scared; not as a man is scared while his judgment, his reason
still try to resist, but completely, boundlessly, and, as it were,
innocently scared&mdash;like a little child.</p>

<p>I could see It&mdash;that Thing! The darkness, of which so much had
just turned into water, had thinned down a little. There It was!
But I did not hit upon the notion of Mr. Burns issuing out of
the companion on all fours till he attempted to stand up, and
even then the idea of a bear crossed my mind first.</p>

<p>He growled like one when I seized him round the body. He had
buttoned himself up into an enormous winter overcoat of some woolly
material, the weight of which was too much for his reduced state.
I could hardly feel the incredibly thin lath of his body, lost
within the thick stuff, but his growl had depth and substance:
Confounded dump ship with a craven, tiptoeing crowd. Why couldn’t
they stamp and go with a brace? Wasn’t there one Godforsaken lubber
in the lot fit to raise a yell on a rope?</p>

<p>"Skulking’s no good, sir," he attacked me directly. "You can’t
slink past the old murderous ruffian. It isn’t the way. You must
go for him boldly&mdash;as I did. Boldness is what you want. Show him
that you don’t care for any of his damned tricks. Kick up a jolly
old row."</p>

<p>"Good God, Mr. Burns," I said angrily. "What on earth are you
up to? What do you mean by coming up on deck in this state?"</p>

<p>"Just that! Boldness. The only way to scare the old bullying
rascal."</p>

<p>I pushed him, still growling, against the rail. "Hold on to it,"
I said roughly. I did not know what to do with him. I left him
in a hurry, to go to Gambril, who had called faintly that he believed
there was some wind aloft. Indeed, my own ears had caught a feeble
flutter of wet canvas, high up overhead, the jingle of a slack
chain sheet. . . .</p>

<p>These were eerie, disturbing, alarming sounds in the dead stillness
of the air around me. All the instances I had heard of topmasts
being whipped out of a ship while there was not wind enough on
her deck to blow out a match rushed into my memory.</p>

<p>"I can’t see the upper sails, sir," declared Gambril shakily.</p>

<p>"Don’t move the helm. You’ll be all right," I said confidently.</p>

<p>The poor man’s nerves were gone. Mine were not in much better
case. It was the moment of breaking strain and was relieved by
the abrupt sensation of the ship moving forward as if of herself
under my feet. I heard plainly the soughing of the wind aloft,
the low cracks of the upper spars taking the strain, long before
I could feel the least draught on my face turned aft, anxious
and sightless like the face of a blind man.</p>

<p>Suddenly a louder-sounding note filled our ears, the darkness
started streaming against our bodies, chilling them exceedingly.
Both of us, Gambril and I, shivered violently in our clinging,
soaked garments of thin cotton. I said to him:</p>

<p>"You are all right now, my man. All you’ve got to do is to keep
the wind at the back of your head. Surely you are up to that.
A child could steer this ship in smooth water."</p>

<p>He muttered: "Aye! A healthy child." And I felt ashamed of having
been passed over by the fever which had been preying on every
man’s strength but mine, in order that my remorse might be the
more bitter, the feeling of unworthiness more poignant, and the
sense of responsibility heavier to bear.</p>

<p>The ship had gathered great way on her almost at once on the
calm water. I felt her slipping through it with no other noise
but a mysterious rustle alongside. Otherwise, she had no motion
at all, neither lift nor roll. It was a disheartening steadiness
which had lasted for eighteen days now; for never, never had we
had wind enough in that time to raise the slightest run of the
sea. The breeze freshened suddenly. I thought it was high time
to get Mr. Burns off the deck. He worried me. I looked upon him
as a lunatic who would be very likely to start roaming over the
ship and break a limb or fall overboard.</p>

<p>I was truly glad to find he had remained holding on where I had
left him, sensibly enough. He was, however, muttering to himself
ominously.</p>

<p>This was discouraging. I remarked in a matter-of-fact tone:</p>

<p>"We have never had so much wind as this since we left the roads."</p>

<p>"There’s some heart in it, too," he growled judiciously. It was
a remark of a perfectly sane seaman. But he added immediately:
"It was about time I should come on deck. I’ve been nursing my
strength for this&mdash;just for this. Do you see it, sir?"</p>

<p>I said I did, and proceeded to hint that it would be advisable
for him to go below now and take a rest.</p>

<p>His answer was an indignant "Go below! Not if I know it, sir."</p>

<p>Very cheerful! He was a horrible nuisance. And all at once he
started to argue. I could feel his crazy excitement in the dark.</p>

<p>"You don’t know how to go about it, sir. How could you? All this
whispering and tiptoeing is no good. You can’t hope to slink past
a cunning, wide-awake, evil brute like he was. You never heard
him talk. Enough to make your hair stand on end. No! No! He wasn’t
mad. He was no more mad than I am. He was just downright wicked.
Wicked so as to frighten most people. I will tell you what he
was. He was nothing less than a thief and a murderer at heart.
And do you think he’s any different now because he’s dead? Not
he! His carcass lies a hundred fathom under, but he’s just the
same . . . in latitude 8 d 20’ north."</p>

<p>He snorted defiantly. I noted with weary resignation that the
breeze had got lighter while he raved. He was at it again.</p>

<p>"I ought to have thrown the beggar out of the ship over the rail
like a dog. It was only on account of the men. . . . Fancy having
to read the Burial Service over a brute like that! . . . ‘Our
departed brother’ . . . I could have laughed. That was what he
couldn’t bear. I suppose I am the only man that ever stood up
to laugh at him. When he got sick it used to scare that . . .
brother. . . . Brother. . . . Departed. . . . Sooner call a shark
brother."</p>

<p>The breeze had let go so suddenly that the way of the ship brought
the wet sails heavily against the mast. The spell of deadly stillness
had caught us up again. There seemed to be no escape.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" exclaimed Mr. Burns in a startled voice. "Calm again!"</p>

<p>I addressed him as though he had been sane.</p>

<p>"This is the sort of thing we’ve been having for seventeen days,
Mr. Burns," I said with intense bitterness. "A puff, then a calm,
and in a moment, you’ll see, she’ll be swinging on her heel with
her head away from her course to the devil somewhere."</p>

<p>He caught at the word. "The old dodging Devil," he screamed piercingly
and burst into such a loud laugh as I had never heard before.
It was a provoking, mocking peal, with a hair-raising, screeching
over-note of defiance. I stepped back, utterly confounded.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a stir on the quarter-deck; murmurs of dismay.
A distressed voice cried out in the dark below us: "Who’s that
gone crazy, now?"</p>

<p>Perhaps they thought it was their captain? Rush is not the word
that could be applied to the utmost speed the poor fellows were
up to; but in an amazing short time every man in the ship able
to walk upright had found his way on to that poop.</p>

<p>I shouted to them: "It’s the mate. Lay hold of him a couple of
you. . . ."</p>

<p>I expected this performance to end in a ghastly sort of fight.
But Mr. Burns cut his derisive screeching dead short and turned
upon them fiercely, yelling:</p>

<p>"Aha! Dog-gone ye! You’ve found your tongues&mdash;have ye? I thought
you were dumb. Well, then&mdash;laugh! Laugh &mdash;I tell you. Now
then&mdash;all together. One, two, three&mdash;laugh!"</p>

<p>A moment of silence ensued, of silence so profound that you could
have heard a pin drop on the deck. Then Ransome’s unperturbed
voice uttered pleasantly the words:</p>

<p>"I think he has fainted, sir&mdash;" The little motionless knot of
men stirred, with low murmurs of relief. "I’ve got him under the
arms. Get hold of his legs, some one."</p>

<p>Yes. It was a relief. He was silenced for a time&mdash;for a time.
I could not have stood another peal of that insane screeching.
I was sure of it; and just then Gambril, the austere Gambril,
treated us to another vocal performance. He began to sing out
for relief. His voice wailed pitifully in the darkness: "Come
aft somebody! I can’t stand this. Here she’ll be off again directly
and I can’t. . . ."</p>

<p>I dashed aft myself meeting on my way a hard gust of wind whose
approach Gambril’s ear had detected from afar and which filled
the sails on the main in a series of muffled reports mingled with
the low plaint of the spars. I was just in time to seize the wheel
while Frenchy who had followed me caught up the collapsing Gambril.
He hauled him out of the way, admonished him to lie still where
he was, and then stepped up to relieve me, asking calmly:</p>

<p>"How am I to steer her, sir?"</p>

<p>"Dead before it for the present. I’ll get you a light in a moment."</p>

<p>But going forward I met Ransome bringing up the spare binnacle
lamp. That man noticed everything, attended to everything, shed
comfort around him as he moved. As he passed me he remarked in
a soothing tone that the stars were coming out. They were. The
breeze was sweeping clear the sooty sky, breaking through the
indolent silence of the sea.</p>

<p>The barrier of awful stillness which had encompassed us for so
many days as though we had been accursed, was broken. I felt that.
I let myself fall on to the skylight seat. A faint white ridge
of foam, thin, very thin, broke alongside. The first for ages&mdash;for
ages. I could have cheered, if it hadn’t been for the sense of
guilt which clung to all my thoughts secretly. Ransome stood before
me.</p>

<p>"What about the mate," I asked anxiously. "Still unconscious?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir&mdash;it’s funny," Ransome was evidently puzzled. "He hasn’t
spoken a word, and his eyes are shut. But it looks to me more
like sound sleep than anything else."</p>

<p>I accepted this view as the least troublesome of any, or at any
rate, least disturbing. Dead faint or deep slumber, Mr. Burns
had to be left to himself for the present. Ransome remarked suddenly:</p>

<p>"I believe you want a coat, sir."</p>

<p>"I believe I do," I sighed out.</p>

<p>But I did not move. What I felt I wanted were new limbs. My arms
and legs seemed utterly useless, fairly worn out. They didn’t
even ache. But I stood up all the same to put on the coat when
Ransome brought it up. And when he suggested that he had better
now "take Gambril forward," I said:</p>

<p>"All right. I’ll help you to get him down on the main deck."</p>

<p>I found that I was quite able to help, too. We raised Gambril
up between us. He tried to help himself along like a man but all
the time he was inquiring piteously:</p>

<p>"You won’t let me go when we come to the ladder? You won’t let
me go when we come to the ladder?"</p>

<p>The breeze kept on freshening and blew true, true to a hair.
At daylight by careful manipulation of the helm we got the foreyards
to run square by themselves (the water keeping smooth) and then
went about hauling the ropes tight. Of the four men I had with
me at night, I could see now only two. I didn’t inquire as to
the others. They had given in. For a time only I hoped.</p>

<p>Our various tasks forward occupied us for hours, the two men
with me moved so slow and had to rest so often. One of them remarked
that "every blamed thing in the ship felt about a hundred times
heavier than its proper weight." This was the only complaint uttered.
I don’t know what we should have done without Ransome. He worked
with us, silent, too, with a little smile frozen on his lips.
From time to time I murmured to him: "Go steady"&mdash;"Take it easy,
Ransome"&mdash;and received a quick glance in reply.</p>

<p>When we had done all we could do to make things safe, he disappeared
into his galley. Some time afterward, going forward for a look
round, I caught sight of him through the open door. He sat upright
on the locker in front of the stove, with his head leaning back
against the bulkhead. His eyes were closed; his capable hands
held open the front of his thin cotton shirt baring tragically
his powerful chest, which heaved in painful and laboured gasps.
He didn’t hear me.</p>

<p>I retreated quietly and went straight on to the poop to relieve
Frenchy, who by that time was beginning to look very sick. He
gave me the course with great formality and tried to go off with
a jaunty step, but reeled widely twice before getting out of my
sight.</p>

<p>And then I remained all alone aft, steering my ship, which ran
before the wind with a buoyant lift now and then, and even rolling
a little. Presently Ransome appeared before me with a tray. The
sight of food made me ravenous all at once. He took the wheel
while I sat down of the after grating to eat my breakfast.</p>

<p>"This breeze seems to have done for our crowd," he murmured.
"It just laid them low&mdash;all hands."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "I suppose you and I are the only two fit men
in the ship."</p>

<p>"Frenchy says there’s still a jump left in him. I don’t know.
It can’t be much," continued Ransome with his wistful smile. "Good
little man that. But suppose, sir, that this wind flies round
when we are close to the land&mdash;what are we going to do with her?"</p>

<p>"If the wind shifts round heavily after we close in with the
land she will either run ashore or get dismasted or both. We won’t
be able to do anything with her. She’s running away with us now.
All we can do is to steer her. She’s a ship without a crew."</p>

<p>"Yes. All laid low," repeated Ransome quietly. "I do give them
a look-in forward every now and then, but it’s precious little
I can do for them."</p>

<p>"I, and the ship, and every one on board of her, are very much
indebted to you, Ransome," I said warmly.</p>

<p>He made as though he had not heard me, and steered in silence
till I was ready to relieve him. He surrendered the wheel, picked
up the tray, and for a parting shot informed me that Mr. Burns
was awake and seemed to have a mind to come up on deck.</p>

<p>"I don’t know how to prevent him, sir. I can’t very well stop
down below all the time."</p>

<p>It was clear that he couldn’t. And sure enough Mr. Burns came
on deck dragging himself painfully aft in his enormous overcoat.
I beheld him with a natural dread. To have him around and raving
about the wiles of a dead man while I had to steer a wildly rushing
ship full of dying men was a rather dreadful prospect.</p>

<p>But his first remarks were quite sensible in meaning and tone.
Apparently he had no recollection of the night scene. And if he
had he didn’t betray himself once. Neither did he talk very much.
He sat on the skylight looking desperately ill at first, but that
strong breeze, before which the last remnant of my crew had wilted
down, seemed to blow a fresh stock of vigour into his frame with
every gust. One could almost see the process.</p>

<p>By way of sanity test I alluded on purpose to the late captain.
I was delighted to find that Mr. Burns did not display undue interest
in the subject. He ran over the old tale of that savage ruffian’s
iniquities with a certain vindictive gusto and then concluded
unexpectedly:</p>

<p>"I do believe, sir, that his brain began to go a year or more
before he died."</p>

<p>A wonderful recovery. I could hardly spare it as much admiration
as it deserved, for I had to give all my mind to the steering.</p>

<p>In comparison with the hopeless languour of the preceding days
this was dizzy speed. Two ridges of foam streamed from the ship’s
bows; the wind sang in a strenuous note which under other circumstances
would have expressed to me all the joy of life. Whenever the hauled-up
mainsail started trying to slat and bang itself to pieces in its
gear, Mr. Burns would look at me apprehensively.</p>

<p>"What would you have me to do, Mr. Burns? We can neither furl
it nor set it. I only wish the old thing would thrash itself to
pieces and be done with it. That beastly racket confuses me."</p>

<p>Mr. Burns wrung his hands, and cried out suddenly:</p>

<p>"How will you get the ship into harbour, sir, without men to
handle her?"</p>

<p>And I couldn’t tell him.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;it did get done about forty hours afterward. By the exorcising
virtue of Mr. Burns’ awful laugh, the malicious spectre had been
laid, the evil spell broken, the curse removed. We were now in
the hands of a kind and energetic Providence. It was rushing us
on. . . .</p>

<p>I shall never forget the last night, dark, windy, and starry.
I steered. Mr. Burns, after having obtained from me a solemn promise
to give him a kick if anything happened, went frankly to sleep
on the deck close to the binnacle. Convalescents need sleep. Ransome,
his back propped against the mizzen-mast and a blanket over his
legs, remained perfectly still, but I don’t suppose he closed
his eyes for a moment. That embodiment of jauntiness, Frenchy,
still under the delusion that there was a "jump" left in him,
had insisted on joining us; but mindful of discipline, had laid
himself down as far on the forepart of the poop as he could get,
alongside the bucket-rack.</p>

<p>And I steered, too tired for anxiety, too tired for connected
thought. I had moments of grim exultation and then my heart would
sink awfully at the thought of that forecastle at the other end
of the dark deck, full of fever-stricken men&mdash;some of them dying.
By my fault. But never mind. Remorse must wait. I had to steer.</p>

<p>In the small hours the breeze weakened, then failed altogether.
About five it returned, gentle enough, enabling us to head for
the roadstead. Daybreak found Mr. Burns sitting wedged up with
coils of rope on the stern-grating, and from the depths of his
overcoat steering the ship with very white bony hands; while Ransome
and I rushed along the decks letting go all the sheets and halliards
by the run. We dashed next up on to the forecastle head. The perspiration
of labour and sheer nervousness simply poured off our heads as
we toiled to get the anchors cock-billed. I dared not look at
Ransome as we worked side by side. We exchanged curt words; I
could hear him panting close to me and I avoided turning my eyes
his way for fear of seeing him fall down and expire in the act
of putting forth his strength&mdash;for what? Indeed for some distinct
ideal.</p>

<p>The consummate seaman in him was aroused. He needed no directions.
He knew what to do. Every effort, every movement was an act of
consistent heroism. It was not for me to look at a man thus inspired.</p>

<p>At last all was ready and I heard him say:</p>

<p>"Hadn’t I better go down and open the compressors now, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do," I said.</p>

<p>And even then I did not glance his way. After a time his voice
came up from the main deck.</p>

<p>"When you like, sir. All clear on the windlass here."</p>

<p>I made a sign to Mr. Burns to put the helm down and let both
anchors go one after another, leaving the ship to take as much
cable as she wanted. She took the best part of them both before
she brought up. The loose sails coming aback ceased their maddening
racket above my head. A perfect stillness reigned in the ship.
And while I stood forward feeling a little giddy in that sudden
peace, I caught faintly a moan or two and the incoherent mutterings
of the sick in the forecastle.</p>

<p>As we had a signal for medical assistance flying on the mizzen
it is a fact that before the ship was fairly at rest three steam
launches from various men-of-war were alongside; and at least
five naval surgeons had clambered on board. They stood in a knot
gazing up and down the empty main deck, then looked aloft&mdash;where
not a man could be seen, either.</p>

<p>I went toward them&mdash;a solitary figure, in a blue and gray striped
sleeping suit and a pipe-clayed cork helmet on its head. Their
disgust was extreme. They had expected surgical cases. Each one
had brought his carving tools with him. But they soon got over
their little disappointment. In less than five minutes one of
the steam launches was rushing shoreward to order a big boat and
some hospital people for the removal of the crew. The big steam
pinnace went off to her ship to bring over a few bluejackets to
furl my sails for me.</p>

<p>One of the surgeons had remained on board. He came out of the
forecastle looking impenetrable, and noticed my inquiring gaze.</p>

<p>"There’s nobody dead in there, if that’s what you want to know,"
he said deliberately. Then added in a tone of wonder: "The whole
crew!"</p>

<p>"And very bad?"</p>

<p>"And very bad," he repeated. His eyes were roaming all over the
ship. "Heavens! What’s that?"</p>

<p>"That," I said, glancing aft, "is Mr. Burns, my chief officer."</p>

<p>Mr. Burns with his moribund head nodding on the stalk of his
lean neck was a sight for any one to exclaim at. The surgeon asked:</p>

<p>"Is he going to the hospital, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," I said jocosely. "Mr. Burns can’t go on shore till
the mainmast goes. I am very proud of him. He’s my only convalescent."</p>

<p>"You look&mdash;" began the doctor staring at me. But I interrupted
him angrily:</p>

<p>"I am not ill."</p>

<p>"No. . . . You look queer."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I have been seventeen days on deck."</p>

<p>"Seventeen! . . . But you must have slept."</p>

<p>"I suppose I must have. I don’t know. But I’m certain that I
didn’t sleep for the last forty hours."</p>

<p>"Phew! . . . You will be going ashore presently I suppose?"</p>

<p>"As soon as ever I can. There’s no end of business waiting for
me there."</p>

<p>The surgeon released my hand, which he had taken while we talked,
pulled out his pocket-book, wrote in it rapidly, tore out the
page and offered it to me.</p>

<p>"I strongly advise you to get this prescription made up for yourself
ashore. Unless I am much mistaken you will need it this evening."</p>

<p>"What is it, then?" I asked with suspicion.</p>

<p>"Sleeping draught," answered the surgeon curtly; and moving with
an air of interest toward Mr. Burns he engaged him in conversation.</p>

<p>As I went below to dress to go ashore, Ransome followed me. He
begged my pardon; he wished, too, to be sent ashore and paid off.</p>

<p>I looked at him in surprise. He was waiting for my answer with
an air of anxiety.</p>

<p>"You don’t mean to leave the ship!" I cried out.</p>

<p>"I do really, sir. I want to go and be quiet somewhere. Anywhere.
The hospital will do."</p>

<p>"But, Ransome," I said. "I hate the idea of parting with you."</p>

<p>"I must go," he broke in. "I have a right!" . . . He gasped and
a look of almost savage determination passed over his face. For
an instant he was another being. And I saw under the worth and
the comeliness of the man the humble reality of things. Life was
a boon to him&mdash;this precarious hard life, and he was thoroughly
alarmed about himself.</p>

<p>"Of course I shall pay you off if you wish it," I hastened to
say. "Only I must ask you to remain on board till this afternoon.
I can’t leave Mr. Burns absolutely by himself in the ship for
hours."</p>

<p>He softened at once and assured me with a smile and in his natural
pleasant voice that he understood that very well.</p>

<p>When I returned on deck everything was ready for the removal
of the men. It was the last ordeal of that episode which had been
maturing and tempering my character&mdash;though I did not know it.</p>

<p>It was awful. They passed under my eyes one after another&mdash;each
of them an embodied reproach of the bitterest kind, till I felt
a sort of revolt wake up in me. Poor Frenchy had gone suddenly
under. He was carried past me insensible, his comic face horribly
flushed and as if swollen, breathing stertorously. He looked more
like Mr. Punch than ever; a disgracefully intoxicated Mr. Punch.</p>

<p>The austere Gambril, on the contrary, had improved temporarily.
He insisted on walking on his own feet to the rail&mdash;of course
with assistance on each side of him. But he gave way to a sudden
panic at the moment of being swung over the side and began to
wail pitifully:</p>

<p>"Don’t let them drop me, sir. Don’t let them drop me, sir!" While
I kept on shouting to him in most soothing accents: "All right,
Gambril. They won’t! They won’t!"</p>

<p>It was no doubt very ridiculous. The bluejackets on our deck
were grinning quietly, while even Ransome himself (much to the
fore in lending a hand) had to enlarge his wistful smile for a
fleeting moment.</p>

<p>I left for the shore in the steam pinnace, and on looking back
beheld Mr. Burns actually standing up by the taffrail, still in
his enormous woolly overcoat. The bright sunlight brought out
his weirdness amazingly. He looked like a frightful and elaborate
scarecrow set up on the poop of a death-stricken ship, set up
to keep the seabirds from the corpses.</p>

<p>Our story had got about already in town and everybody on shore
was most kind. The Marine Office let me off the port dues, and
as there happened to be a shipwrecked crew staying in the Home
I had no difficulty in obtaining as many men as I wanted. But
when I inquired if I could see Captain Ellis for a moment I was
told in accents of pity for my ignorance that our deputy-Neptune
had retired and gone home on a pension about three weeks after
I left the port. So I suppose that my appointment was the last
act, outside the daily routine, of his official life.</p>

<p>It is strange how on coming ashore I was struck by the springy
step, the lively eyes, the strong vitality of every one I met.
It impressed me enormously. And amongst those I met there was
Captain Giles, of course. It would have been very extraordinary
if I had not met him. A prolonged stroll in the business part
of the town was the regular employment of all his mornings when
he was ashore.</p>

<p>I caught the glitter of the gold watch-chain across his chest
ever so far away. He radiated benevolence.</p>

<p>"What is it I hear?" he queried with a "kind uncle" smile, after
shaking hands. "Twenty-one days from Bangkok?"</p>

<p>"Is this all you’ve heard?" I said. "You must come to tiffin
with me. I want you to know exactly what you have let me in for."</p>

<p>He hesitated for almost a minute.</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;I will," he said condescendingly at last.</p>

<p>We turned into the hotel. I found to my surprise that I could
eat quite a lot. Then over the cleared table-cloth I unfolded
to Captain Giles the history of these twenty days in all its professional
and emotional aspects, while he smoked patiently the big cigar
I had given him.</p>

<p>Then he observed sagely:</p>

<p>"You must feel jolly well tired by this time."</p>

<p>"No," I said. "Not tired. But I’ll tell you, Captain Giles, how
I feel. I feel old. And I must be. All of you on shore look to
me just a lot of skittish youngsters that have never known a care
in the world."</p>

<p>He didn’t smile. He looked insufferably exemplary. He declared:</p>

<p>"That will pass. But you do look older&mdash;it’s a fact."</p>

<p>"Aha!" I said.</p>

<p>"No! No! The truth is that one must not make too much of anything
in life, good or bad."</p>

<p>"Live at half-speed," I murmured perversely. "Not everybody can
do that."</p>

<p>"You’ll be glad enough presently if you can keep going even at
that rate," he retorted with his air of conscious virtue. "And
there’s another thing: a man should stand up to his bad luck,
to his mistakes, to his conscience and all that sort of thing.
Why&mdash;what else would you have to fight against."</p>

<p>I kept silent. I don’t know what he saw in my face but he asked
abruptly:</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;you aren’t faint-hearted?"</p>

<p>"God only knows, Captain Giles," was my sincere answer.</p>

<p>"That’s all right," he said calmly. "You will learn soon how
not to be faint-hearted. A man has got to learn everything&mdash;and
that’s what so many of them youngsters don’t understand."</p>

<p>"Well, I am no longer a youngster."</p>

<p>"No," he conceded. "Are you leaving soon?"</p>

<p>"I am going on board directly," I said. "I shall pick up one
of my anchors and heave in to half-cable on the other directly
my new crew comes on board and I shall be off at daylight to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"You will," grunted Captain Giles approvingly, "that’s the way.
You’ll do."</p>

<p>"What did you think? That I would want to take a week ashore
for a rest?" I said, irritated by his tone. "There’s no rest for
me till she’s out in the Indian Ocean and not much of it even
then."</p>

<p>He puffed at his cigar moodily, as if transformed.</p>

<p>"Yes. That’s what it amounts to," he said in a musing tone. It
was as if a ponderous curtain had rolled up disclosing an unexpected
Captain Giles. But it was only for a moment, just the time to
let him add, "Precious little rest in life for anybody. Better
not think of it."</p>

<p>We rose, left the hotel, and parted from each other in the street
with a warm handshake, just as he began to interest me for the
first time in our intercourse.</p>

<p>The first thing I saw when I got back to the ship was Ransome
on the quarter-deck sitting quietly on his neatly lashed sea-chest.</p>

<p>I beckoned him to follow me into the saloon where I sat down
to write a letter of recommendation for him to a man I knew on
shore.</p>

<p>When finished I pushed it across the table. "It may be of some
good to you when you leave the hospital."</p>

<p>He took it, put it in his pocket. His eyes were looking away
from me&mdash;nowhere. His face was anxiously set.</p>

<p>"How are you feeling now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don’t feel bad now, sir," he answered stiffly. "But I am afraid
of its coming on. . . ." The wistful smile came back on his lips
for a moment. "I &mdash;I am in a blue funk about my heart, sir."</p>

<p>I approached him with extended hand. His eyes not looking at
me had a strained expression. He was like a man listening for
a warning call.</p>

<p>"Won’t you shake hands, Ransome?" I said gently.</p>

<p>He exclaimed, flushed up dusky red, gave my hand a hard wrench&mdash;and
next moment, left alone in the cabin, I listened to him going
up the companion stairs cautiously, step by step, in mortal fear
of starting into sudden anger our common enemy it was his hard
fate to carry consciously within his faithful breast.</p>
