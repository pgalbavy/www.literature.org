<p>Neither the Pah Utah nor the Irishman were disposed to make a
move until they had finished their "smoke," and both of them whiffed
as leisurely as though they had contracted to spend several hours
thus. Howard and Elwood passed the time in walking around the
woods and along the stream, taking particular care not to go beyond
sight of Shasta, whose black orbs they could see attentively following
their movements.</p>

<p>"All aboord!" shouted Tim at the expiration of an hour or so,
and the boys hurried down to the "wharf" with as much alacrity
as if they had heard the last bell of the steamer.</p>

<p>The Indian stood upon the shore with a look of inquiry. He pointed
up stream and then down.</p>

<p>"He is inquiring which way we wish to go," said Howard.</p>

<p>"That, is strange, after bringing us so many miles from the island."</p>

<p>Elwood pointed down stream, but Shasta was not satisfied; he
wished to know something more. He described several circles, terminating
each time by pointing to the north. All three looked inquiringly
at one other's faces. They could not comprehend his meaning.</p>

<p>"What does he wish to say?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I cannot tell."</p>

<p>"He wants us to travel the rest of the way by turning summersits."</p>

<p>Seeing that he was not understood, the Pah Utah took the paddle
from the canoe and made in the air as if he were impelling the
boat, then pausing, he again pointed to the north, and took several
long strides in that direction, as though he were going to walk
a long distance.</p>

<p>Elwood's eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"I know what, he means! I know what he means!"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"He wishes to ask whether we want to <em>go a good ways</em>!"</p>

<p>"You are right," replied Howard. "He doesn't know whether we
are hunting in these parts, and wish to stay in the neighborhood,
or whether we are hurrying home as fast as we can."</p>

<p>Shasta's motions and signs were imitated as nearly as possible,
and he nodded his head and muttered something doubtless to signify
that he was satisfied. Terror whisked into the canoe and took
his position in the prow, while his three masters, if a dog can
own that many, arranged themselves behind him. The tendon still
united the two boats, and one sweep of Pah Utah's paddle sent
the two far out into the river, where he began his work.</p>

<p>For a time our friends gave themselves up to the enjoyment of
this pleasant motion. At each dip of the paddle, or contraction
of the iron muscles of Shasta, they could feel the canoe jump
forward as does a steamboat under the throbs of the mighty engine.
At the same time the motion was light and airy, as if the boat
were skimming over the very surface. Indeed, by shutting the eyes
and feeling the light wind fanning the temples, it was easy to
imagine that they were borne through the air by some great bird
whose wings could be felt to pulsate beneath them.</p>

<p>"Look at that machinery!" exclaimed Howard. "Did you ever see
anything like it? Not an ounce of superfluous flesh upon him.
See how the muscles swell and ridge, and yet he doesn't swerve
his body a hair's breadth to the right or left."</p>

<p>"He can 'paddle his own canoe,'" laughed Elwood.</p>

<p>"Look at those shoulders; they are perfect mountains of muscle,
and those sinewy arm! His legs are fully as perfect, and I'll
warrant he can run a dozen miles an hour for a whole day without
getting tired. He would be a dangerous man to meet as an enemy."</p>

<p>"And a good one as a friend."</p>

<p>"Yes; I can hardly see what chances we would have had of reaching
the mouth of the river without his help."</p>

<p>"We had no chance unless we could join a party of hunters and
induce them to go with us."</p>

<p>"Boys," said Tim, looking hard at them, "it isn't right&mdash;isn't
the same."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That Mr. Shasta should tow us along in this shtyle, and we sit
in the owld boat and permit him. No, it's wrong."</p>

<p>The boys admitted that it looked hardly proper, whereupon Tim
took the paddle and began plying it with all the skill of which
he was master. The Pah Utah looked over his shoulder now and then
with a strange expression, as if he were amused at the white man's
furious efforts, but he did not abate his own labor in the least.</p>

<p>Tim O'Rooney made a great deal of splashing, occasionally flirting
a shower of spray over his friends as the paddle took an unexpected
twist in his hand; but, as we have said before, he had had considerable
experience in propelling a canoe, and he gave a little assistance
to their dusky friend.</p>

<p>When the sun was overhead, Shasta directed the prow of the boat
toward the western bank, and they landed in a place somewhat resembling
that of the morning. The boats were drawn upon land in the usual
manner, by which they were concealed from the observation of any
passing up or down stream.</p>

<p>The Indian resorted to the same means by which he had caught
the fish in the morning and with equal success. They were rather
smaller, but none the less savory, either to man or brute. An
hour sufficed to rest them all, and to give Shasta all the pleasure
of his pipe that he wished, while Tim continued his after entering
the canoe. Howard and Elwood made an essay with the paddle, but
the result with the latter was that the instant he so cautiously
thrust it beneath the surface, it was suddenly wrung from his
hand, and in an instant left a rod or two astern. This necessitated
a delay in order to pick it up, and the boys concluded to await
another time to perfect themselves in the art of managing an Indian
canoe.</p>

<p>It was not until it was quite dark that they once more set foot
upon land and kindled their fire. There was quite a strong wind
blowing, and the chill of the air appeared to indicate that it
came from the snowy peaks of the Coast Range. Fully an hour was
taken in gathering wood, sticks, broken limbs and branches, for
they had concluded to keep it burning until morning.</p>

<p>The fire was kindled against the trunk of a giant sycamore, and
as the flames waved up the shaggy bark the reflection upon the
outstretched limbs and neighboring trees gave them a weird appearance
that made the boys gather close to the somber-hued Pah Utah as
though conscious of his ability to stand between them and evil.</p>

<p>Tim and Shasta were leisurely smoking their pipes, and Howard
and Elwood were conversing together in low tones of their homes
and friends, when a quick bark from Terror, as he rose to his
feet and looked in the darkness, drew all eyes in one direction.
A score of flashing eyes, gleaming teeth, lank, restless bodies
and greedy jaws announced, that a new danger threatened them.</p>
