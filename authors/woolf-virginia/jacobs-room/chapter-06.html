<p>The flames had fairly caught.</p>

<p>"There's St. Paul's!" some one cried.</p>

<p>As the wood caught the city of London was lit up for a second;
on other sides of the fire there were trees. Of the faces which
came out fresh and vivid as though painted in yellow and red,
the most prominent was a girl's face. By a trick of the firelight
she seemed to have no body. The oval of the face and hair hung
beside the fire with a dark vacuum for background. As if dazed
by the glare, her green-blue eyes stared at the flames. Every
muscle of her face was taut. There was something tragic in her
thus staring&mdash;her age between twenty and twenty-five.</p>

<p>A hand descending from the chequered darkness thrust on her head
the conical white hat of a pierrot. Shaking her head, she still
stared. A whiskered face appeared above her. They dropped two
legs of a table upon the fire and a scattering of twigs and leaves.
All this blazed up and showed faces far back, round, pale, smooth,
bearded, some with billycock hats on; all intent; showed too St.
Paul's floating on the uneven white mist, and two or three narrow,
paper-white, extinguisher-shaped spires.</p>

<p>The flames were struggling through the wood and roaring up when,
goodness knows where from, pails flung water in beautiful hollow
shapes, as of polished tortoiseshell; flung again and again; until
the hiss was like a swarm of bees; and all the faces went out.</p>

<p>"Oh Jacob," said the girl, as they pounded up the hill in the
dark, "I'm so frightfully unhappy!"</p>

<p>Shouts of laughter came from the others&mdash;high, low; some before,
others after.</p>

<p>The hotel dining-room was brightly lit. A stag's head in plaster
was at one end of the table; at the other some Roman bust blackened
and reddened to represent Guy Fawkes, whose night it was. The
diners were linked together by lengths of paper roses, so that
when it came to singing "Auld Lang Syne" with their hands crossed
a pink and yellow line rose and fell the entire length of the
table. There was an enormous tapping of green wine-glasses. A
young man stood up, and Florinda, taking one of the purplish globes
that lay on the table, flung it straight at his head. It crushed
to powder.</p>

<p>"I'm so frightfully unhappy!" she said, turning to Jacob, who
sat beside her.</p>

<p>The table ran, as if on invisible legs, to the side of the room,
and a barrel organ decorated with a red cloth and two pots of
paper flowers reeled out waltz music.</p>

<p>Jacob could not dance. He stood against the wall smoking a pipe.</p>

<p>"We think," said two of the dancers, breaking off from the rest,
and bowing profoundly before him, "that you are the most beautiful
man we have ever seen."</p>

<p>So they wreathed his head with paper flowers. Then somebody brought
out a white and gilt chair and made him sit on it. As they passed,
people hung glass grapes on his shoulders, until he looked like
the figure-head of a wrecked ship. Then Florinda got upon his
knee and hid her face in his waistcoat. With one hand he held
her; with the other, his pipe.</p>

<p>"Now let us talk," said Jacob, as he walked down Haverstock Hill
between four and five o'clock in the morning of November the sixth
arm-in-arm with Timmy Durrant, "about something sensible."</p>

<p>The Greeks&mdash;yes, that was what they talked about&mdash;how when all's
said and done, when one's rinsed one's mouth with every literature
in the world, including Chinese and Russian (but these Slavs aren't
civilized), it's the flavour of Greek that remains. Durrant quoted
Aeschylus &mdash;Jacob Sophocles. It is true that no Greek could
have understood or professor refrained from pointing out &mdash;Never
mind; what is Greek for if not to be shouted on Haverstock Hill
in the dawn? Moreover, Durrant never listened to Sophocles, nor
Jacob to Aeschylus. They were boastful, triumphant; it seemed
to both that they had read every book in the world; known every
sin, passion, and joy. Civilizations stood round them like flowers
ready for picking. Ages lapped at their feet like waves fit for
sailing. And surveying all this, looming through the fog, the
lamplight, the shades of London, the two young men decided in
favour of Greece.</p>

<p>"Probably," said Jacob, "we are the only people in the world
who know what the Greeks meant."</p>

<p>They drank coffee at a stall where the urns were burnished and
little lamps burnt along the counter.</p>

<p>Taking Jacob for a military gentleman, the stall-keeper told
him about his boy at Gibraltar, and Jacob cursed the British army
and praised the Duke of Wellington. So on again they went down
the hill talking about the Greeks.</p>

<p>A strange thing&mdash;when you come to think of it&mdash;this love of Greek,
flourishing in such obscurity, distorted, discouraged, yet leaping
out, all of a sudden, especially on leaving crowded rooms, or
after a surfeit of print, or when the moon floats among the waves
of the hills, or in hollow, sallow, fruitless London days, like
a specific; a clean blade; always a miracle. Jacob knew no more
Greek than served him to stumble through a play. Of ancient history
he knew nothing. However, as he tramped into London it seemed
to him that they were making the flagstones ring on the road to
the Acropolis, and that if Socrates saw them coming he would bestir
himself and say "my fine fellows," for the whole sentiment of
Athens was entirely after his heart; free, venturesome, high-spirited....
She had called him Jacob without asking his leave. She had sat
upon his knee. Thus did all good women in the days of the Greeks.</p>

<p>At this moment there shook out into the air a wavering, quavering,
doleful lamentation which seemed to lack strength to unfold itself,
and yet flagged on; at the sound of which doors in back streets
burst sullenly open; workmen stumped forth.</p>

<p>Florinda was sick.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durrant, sleepless as usual, scored a mark by the side of
certain lines in the Inferno.</p>

<p>Clara slept buried in her pillows; on her dressing-table dishevelled
roses and a pair of long white gloves.</p>

<p>Still wearing the conical white hat of a pierrot, Florinda was
sick.</p>

<p>The bedroom seemed fit for these catastrophes&mdash;cheap, mustard-coloured,
half attic, half studio, curiously ornamented with silver paper
stars, Welshwomen's hats, and rosaries pendent from the gas brackets.
As for Florinda's story, her name had been bestowed upon her by
a painter who had wished it to signify that the flower of her
maidenhood was still unplucked. Be that as it may, she was without
a surname, and for parents had only the photograph of a tombstone
beneath which, she said, her father lay buried. Sometimes she
would dwell upon the size of it, and rumour had it that Florinda's
father had died from the growth of his bones which nothing could
stop; just as her mother enjoyed the confidence of a Royal master,
and now and again Florinda herself was a Princess, but chiefly
when drunk. Thus deserted, pretty into the bargain, with tragic
eyes and the lips of a child, she talked more about virginity
than women mostly do; and had lost it only the night before, or
cherished it beyond the heart in her breast, according to the
man she talked to. But did she always talk to men? No, she had
her confidante: Mother Stuart. Stuart, as the lady would point
out, is the name of a Royal house; but what that signified, and
what her business way, no one knew; only that Mrs. Stuart got
postal orders every Monday morning, kept a parrot, believed in
the transmigration of souls, and could read the future in tea
leaves. Dirty lodging-house wallpaper she was behind the chastity
of Florinda.</p>

<p>Now Florinda wept, and spent the day wandering the streets; stood
at Chelsea watching the river swim past; trailed along the shopping
streets; opened her bag and powdered her cheeks in omnibuses;
read love letters, propping them against the milk pot in the <em>A.B.C.
</em>shop; detected glass in the sugar bowl; accused the waitress
of wishing to poison her; declared that young men stared at her;
and found herself towards evening slowly sauntering down Jacob's
street, when it struck her that she liked that man Jacob better
than dirty Jews, and sitting at his table (he was copying his
essay upon the Ethics of Indecency), drew off her gloves and told
him how Mother Stuart had banged her on the head with the tea-cosy.</p>

<p>Jacob took her word for it that she was chaste. She prattled,
sitting by the fireside, of famous painters. The tomb of her father
was mentioned. Wild and frail and beautiful she looked, and thus
the women of the Greeks were, Jacob thought; and this was life;
and himself a man and Florinda chaste.</p>

<p>She left with one of Shelley's poems beneath her arm. Mrs. Stuart,
she said, often talked of him.</p>

<p>Marvellous are the innocent. To believe that the girl herself
transcends all lies (for Jacob was not such a fool as to believe
implicitly), to wonder enviously at the unanchored life&mdash;his own
seeming petted and even cloistered in comparison&mdash;to have at hand
as sovereign specifics for all disorders of the soul Adonais and
the plays of Shakespeare; to figure out a comradeship all spirited
on her side, protective on his, yet equal on both, for women,
thought Jacob, are just the same as men&mdash;innocence such as this
is marvellous enough, and perhaps not so foolish after all.</p>

<p>For when Florinda got home that night she first washed her head;
then ate chocolate creams; then opened Shelley. True, she was
horribly bored. What on earth was it <em>ABOUT? </em>She had to
wager with herself that she would turn the page before she ate
another. In fact she slept. But then her day had been a long one,
Mother Stuart had thrown the tea-cosy;&mdash;there are formidable sights
in the streets, and though Florinda was ignorant as an owl, and
would never learn to read even her love letters correctly, still
she had her feelings, liked some men better than others, and was
entirely at the beck and call of life. Whether or not she was
a virgin seems a matter of no importance whatever. Unless, indeed,
it is the only thing of any importance at all.</p>

<p>Jacob was restless when she left him.</p>

<p>All night men and women seethed up and down the well-known beats.
Late home-comers could see shadows against the blinds even in
the most respectable suburbs. Not a square in snow or fog lacked
its amorous couple. All plays turned on the same subject. Bullets
went through heads in hotel bedrooms almost nightly on that account.
When the body escaped mutilation, seldom did the heart go to the
grave unscarred. Little else was talked of in theatres and popular
novels. Yet we say it is a matter of no importance at all.</p>

<p>What with Shakespeare and Adonais, Mozart and Bishop Berkeley&mdash;choose
whom you like&mdash;the fact is concealed and the evenings for most
of us pass reputably, or with only the sort of tremor that a snake
makes sliding through the grass. But then concealment by itself
distracts the mind from the print and the sound. If Florinda had
had a mind, she might have read with clearer eyes than we can.
She and her sort have solved the question by turning it to a trifle
of washing the hands nightly before going to bed, the only difficulty
being whether you prefer your water hot or cold, which being settled,
the mind can go about its business unassailed.</p>

<p>But it did occur to Jacob, half-way through dinner, to wonder
whether she had a mind.</p>

<p>They sat at a little table in the restaurant.</p>

<p>Florinda leant the points of her elbows on the table and held
her chin in the cup of her hands. Her cloak had slipped behind
her. Gold and white with bright beads on her she emerged, her
face flowering from her body, innocent, scarcely tinted, the eyes
gazing frankly about her, or slowly settling on Jacob and resting
there. She talked:</p>

<p>"You know that big black box the Australian left in my room ever
so long ago? ... I do think furs make a woman look old.... That's
Bechstein come in now.... I was wondering what you looked like
when you were a little boy, Jacob." She nibbled her roll and looked
at him.</p>

<p>"Jacob. You're like one of those statues.... I think there are
lovely things in the British Museum, don't you? Lots of lovely
things ..." she spoke dreamily. The room was filling; the heat
increasing. Talk in a restaurant is dazed sleep-walkers' talk,
so many things to look at&mdash;so much noise&mdash;other people talking.
Can one overhear? Oh, but they mustn't overhear US.</p>

<p>"That's like Ellen Nagle&mdash;that girl ..." and so on.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully happy since I've known you, Jacob. You're such a
<em>GOOD </em>man."</p>

<p>The room got fuller and fuller; talk louder; knives more clattering.</p>

<p>"Well, you see what makes her say things like that is ..."</p>

<p>She stopped. So did every one.</p>

<p>"To-morrow ... Sunday ... a beastly ... you tell me ... go then!"
Crash! And out she swept.</p>

<p>It was at the table next them that the voice spun higher and
higher. Suddenly the woman dashed the plates to the floor. The
man was left there. Everybody stared. Then&mdash;"Well, poor chap,
we mustn't sit staring. What a go! Did you hear what she said?
By God, he looks a fool! Didn't come up to the scratch, I suppose.
All the mustard on the tablecloth. The waiters laughing."</p>

<p>Jacob observed Florinda. In her face there seemed to him something
horribly brainless&mdash;as she sat staring.</p>

<p>Out she swept, the black woman with the dancing feather in her
hat.</p>

<p>Yet she had to go somewhere. The night is not a tumultuous black
ocean in which you sink or sail as a star. As a matter of fact
it was a wet November night. The lamps of Soho made large greasy
spots of light upon the pavement. The by-streets were dark enough
to shelter man or woman leaning against the doorways. One detached
herself as Jacob and Florinda approached.</p>

<p>"She's dropped her glove," said Florinda.</p>

<p>Jacob, pressing forward, gave it her.</p>

<p>Effusively she thanked him; retraced her steps; dropped her glove
again. But why? For whom? Meanwhile, where had the other woman
got to? And the man?</p>

<p>The street lamps do not carry far enough to tell us. The voices,
angry, lustful, despairing, passionate, were scarcely more than
the voices of caged beasts at night. Only they are not caged,
nor beasts. Stop a man; ask him the way; he'll tell it you; but
one's afraid to ask him the way. What does one fear?&mdash;the human
eye. At once the pavement narrows, the chasm deepens. There! They've
melted into it&mdash;both man and woman. Further on, blatantly advertising
its meritorious solidity, a boarding-house exhibits behind uncurtained
windows its testimony to the soundness of London. There they sit,
plainly illuminated, dressed like ladies and gentlemen, in bamboo
chairs. The widows of business men prove laboriously that they
are related to judges. The wives of coal merchants instantly retort
that their fathers kept coachmen. A servant brings coffee, and
the crochet basket has to be moved. And so on again into the dark,
passing a girl here for sale, or there an old woman with only
matches to offer, passing the crowd from the Tube station, the
women with veiled hair, passing at length no one but shut doors,
carved door-posts, and a solitary policeman, Jacob, with Florinda
on his arm, reached his room and, lighting the lamp, said nothing
at all.</p>

<p>"I don't like you when you look like that," said Florinda.</p>

<p>The problem is insoluble. The body is harnessed to a brain. Beauty
goes hand in hand with stupidity. There she sat staring at the
fire as she had stared at the broken mustard-pot. In spite of
defending indecency, Jacob doubted whether he liked it in the
raw. He had a violent reversion towards male society, cloistered
rooms, and the works of the classics; and was ready to turn with
wrath upon whoever it was who had fashioned life thus.</p>

<p>Then Florinda laid her hand upon his knee.</p>

<p>After all, it was none of her fault. But the thought saddened
him. It's not catastrophes, murders, deaths, diseases, that age
and kill us; it's the way people look and laugh, and run up the
steps of omnibuses.</p>

<p>Any excuse, though, serves a stupid woman. He told her his head
ached.</p>

<p>But when she looked at him, dumbly, half-guessing, half-understanding,
apologizing perhaps, anyhow saying as he had said, "It's none
of my fault," straight and beautiful in body, her face like a
shell within its cap, then he knew that cloisters and classics
are no use whatever. The problem is insoluble.</p>
