<p>I went on deck again. On the poop about twenty men had surrounded
Major Cowper; his white head was being jerked backwards and forwards
above their bending backs; they had got his old uniform coat off,
and were fighting for the buttons. I had just time to shout to
him, "Your wife's down there, she's all right!" when very suddenly
I became aware that Tomas Castro was swearing horribly at these
thieves. He drove them away, and we were left quite alone on the
poop, I holding the major's coat over my arm. Major Çowper stooped
down to call through the skylight. I could hear faint answers
coming up to him.</p>

<p>Meantime, some of the rascals left on board the schooner had
filled on her in a light wind, and, sailing round our stern, had
brought their vessel alongside. Ropes were thrown on board and
we lay close together, but the schooner with her dirty decks looked
to me, now, very sinister and very sordid.</p>

<p>Then I remembered Castro's extraordinary words; they suggested
infinite possibilities of a disastrous nature, I could not tell
just what. The explanation seemed to be struggling to bring itself
to light, like a name that one has had for hours on the tip of
a tongue without being able to formulate it. Major Cowper rose
stiffly, and limped to my side. He looked at me askance, then
shifted his eyes away. Afterwards, he took his coat from my arm.
I tried to help him, but he refused my aid, and jerked himself
painfully into it. It was too tight for him. Suddenly, he said:</p>

<p>"You seem to be deuced intimate with that man&mdash;deuced intimate."</p>

<p>His tone caused me more misgiving than I should have thought
possible. He took a turn on the deserted deck; went to the skylight;
called down, "All well, still?" waited, listening with his head
on one side, and then came back to me.</p>

<p>"You drop into the ship," he said, "out of the clouds. Out of
the clouds, I say. You tell us some sort of cock-and-bull story.
I say it looks deuced suspicious." He took another turn and came
back. "My wife says that you took her rings and&mdash;and&mdash;gave them
to<hr>"</p>

<p>He had an ashamed air. It came into my head that that hateful
woman had been egging him on to this through the skylight, instead
of saying her prayers.</p>

<p>"Your wife!" I said. "Why, she might have been murdered&mdash;if I
hadn't made her give them up. I believe I saved her life."</p>

<p>He said suddenly, "Tut, tut!" and shrugged his shoulders. He
hung his head for a minute, then he added, "Mind, I don't say
&mdash;I don't say that it mayn't be as you say. You're a very
nice young fellow.... But what I say is &mdash;I am a public man&mdash;you
ought to clear yourself." He was beginning to recover his military
bearing.</p>

<p>"Oh! don't be absurd," I said.</p>

<p>One of the Spaniards came up to me and whispered, "You must come
now. We are going to cast off." At the same time Tomas Castro
prowled to the other side of the ship, within five yards of us.
I called out, "Tomas Castro! Tomas Castro! I will not go with
you." The man beside me said, "Come, señor! <em>Vamos!</em>"</p>

<p>Suddenly Castro, stretching his arm out at me, cried, "Come,
<em>hombres</em>. This is the <em>caballero</em>; seize him."
And to me in his broken English he shouted, "You may resist, if
you like."</p>

<p>This was what I meant to do with all my might. The ragged crowd
surrounded me; they chattered like monkeys. One man irritated
me beyond conception. He looked like an inn-keeper in knee-breeches,
had a broken nose that pointed to the left, and a double chin.
More of them came running up every minute. I made a sort of blind
rush at the fellow with the broken nose; my elbow caught him on
the soft folds of flesh and he skipped backwards; the rest scattered
in all directions, and then stood at a distance, chattering and
waving their hands. And beyond them I saw old Cowper gesticulating
approval. The man with the double chin drew a knife from his sleeve,
crouched instantly, and sprang at me. I hadn't fought anybody
since I had been at school; raising my fists was like trying a
dubious experiment in an emergency. I caught him rather hard on
the end of his broken nose; I felt the contact on my right, and
a small pain in my left hand. His arms went up to the sky; his
face, too. But I had started forward to meet him, and half a dozen
of them flung their arms round me from behind.</p>

<p>I seemed to have an exaggerated clearness of vision; I saw each
brown dirty paw reach out to clutch some part of me. I was not
angry any more; it wasn't any good being angry, but I made a fight
for it. There were dozens of them; they clutched my wrists, my
elbows, and in between my wrists and my elbows, and my shoulders.
One pair of arms was round my neck, another round my waist, and
they kept on trying to catch my legs with ropes. We seemed to
stagger all over the deck; I expect they got in each other's way;
they would have made a better job of it if they hadn't been such
a multitude. I must then have got a crack on the head, for everything
grew dark; the night seemed to fall on us, as we fought.</p>

<p>Afterwards I found myself lying gasping on my back on the deck
of the schooner; four or five men were holding me down. Castro
was putting a pistol into his belt. He stamped his foot violently,
and then went and shouted in Spanish:</p>

<p>"Come you all on board. You have done mischief enough, fools
of <em>Lugarenos</em>. Now we go."</p>

<p>I saw, as in a dream of stress and violence, some men making
ready to cast off the schooner, and then, in a supreme effort,
an effort of lusty youth and strength, which I remember to this
day, I scattered men like chaff, and stood free.</p>

<p>For the fraction of a second I stood, ready to fall myself, and
looking at prostrate men. It was a flash of vision, and then I
made a bolt for the rail. I clambered furiously; I saw the deck
of the old barque; I had just one exulting sight of it, and then
Major Cowper uprose before my eyes and knocked me back on board
the schooner, tumbling after me himself.</p>

<p>Twenty men flung themselves upon my body. I made no movement.
The end had come. I hadn't the strength to shake off a fly, my
heart was bursting my ribs. I lay on my back and managed to say,
"Give me air." I thought I should die.</p>

<p>Castro, draped in his cloak, stood over me, but Major Cowper
fell on his knees near my head, almost sobbing: "My papers! My
papers! I tell you I shall starve. Make them give me back my papers.
They ain't any use to them&mdash;my pension&mdash;mortgages&mdash;not worth a
penny piece to you."</p>

<p>He crouched over my face, and the Spaniards stood around, wondering.
He begged me to intercede, to save him those papers of the greatest
importance.</p>

<p>Castro preserved his attitude of a conspirator. I was touched
by the major's distress, and at last I condescended to address
Castro on his behalf, though it cost me an effort, for I was angry,
indignant, and humiliated.</p>

<p>"Whart&mdash;whart? What do I know of his papers? Let him find them."
He waved his hand loftily.</p>

<p>The deck was hillocked with heaps of clothing, of bedding, casks
of rum, old hats, and tarpaulins. Cowper ran in and out among
the plunder, like a pointer in a turnip field. He was groaning.</p>

<p>Beside one of the pumps was a small pile of shiny cases; ship's
instruments, a chronometer in its case, a medicine chest.</p>

<p>Cowper tottered at a black dispatch-box. "There, there!" he said;
"I tell you I shall starve if I don't have it. Ask him&mdash;ask him<hr>"
He was clutching me like a drowning man.</p>

<p>Castro raised the inevitable arm towards heaven, letting his
round black cloak fall into folds like those of an umbrella. Cowper
gathered that he might take his japanned dispatch-box; he seized
the brass handles and rushed towards the side, but at the last
moment he had the good impulse to return to me, holding out his
hand, and spluttering distractedly, "God bless you, God bless
you." After a time he remembered that I had rescued his wife and
child, and he asked God to bless me for that too. "If it is ever
necessary," he said, "on my honour, if you escape, I will come
a thousand miles to testify. On my honour&mdash;remember." He said
he was going to live in Clapham. That is as much as I remember.
I was held pinned down to the deck, and he disappeared from my
sight. Before the ships had separated, I was carried below in
the cabin of the schooner.</p>

<p>They left me alone there, and I sat with my head on my arms for
a long time, I did not think of anything at all; I was too utterly
done up with my struggles, and there was nothing to be thought
about. I had grown to accept the meanness of things as if I had
aged a great deal. I had seen men scratch each other's faces over
coat buttons, old shoes&mdash;over Mercer's trousers. My own future
did not interest me at this stage. I sat up and looked round me.</p>

<p>I was in a small, bare cabin, roughly wainscotted and exceedingly
filthy. There were the grease-marks from the backs of heads all
along a bulkhead above a wooden bench; the rough table, on which
my arms rested, was covered with layers of tallow spots. Bright
light shone through a porthole. Two or three ill-assorted muskets
slanted about round the foot of the mast&mdash;a long old piece, of
the time of Pizarro, all red velvet and silver' chasing, on a
swivelled stand, three English fowling-pieces, and a coachman's
blunderbuss. A man was rising from a mattress stretched on the
floor; he placed a mandolin, decorated with red favours, on the
greasy table. He was shockingly thin, and so tall that his head
disturbed the candle-soot on the ceiling. He said: "Ah, I was
waiting for the cavalier to awake."</p>

<p>He stalked round the end of the table, slid between it and the
side, and grasped my arm with wrapt earnestness as he settled
himself slowly beside me. He wore a red shirt that had become
rather black where his long brown ringlets fell on his shoulders;
it had tarnished gilt buttons ciphered "G. R.," stolen, I suppose,
from some English ship.</p>

<p>"I beg the Señor Caballero to listen to what I have to record,"
he said, with intense gravity. "I cannot bear this much longer&mdash;no,
I cannot bear my sufferings much longer."</p>

<p>His face was of a large, classical type; a close-featured, rather
long face, with an immense nose that from the front resembled
the section of a bell; eyebrows like horseshoes, and very large-pupilled
eyes that had the purplish-brown lustre of a horse's. His air
was mournful in the extreme, and he began to speak resonantly
as if his chest were a sounding-board. He used immensely long
sentences, of which I only understood one-half.</p>

<p>"What, then, is the difference between me, Manuel-del-Popolo
Isturiz, and this Tomas Castro? The Señor Caballero can tell at
once. Look at me. I am the finer man. I would have you ask the
ladies of Rio Medio, and leave the verdict to them. This Castro
is an Andalou&mdash;a foreigner. And we, the braves of Rio Medio, will
suffer no foreigner to make headway with our ladies. Yet this
Andalusian is preferred because he is a humble friend of the great
Don, and because he is for a few days given the command. I ask
you, Señor, what is the radical difference between me, the sailing
captain of this vessel, and him, the fighting captain for a few
days? Is it not I that am, as it were, the brains of it, and he
only its knife? I ask the Señor Caballero."</p>

<p>I didn't in the least know what to answer. His great eyes wistfully
explored my face. I expect I looked bewildered.</p>

<p>"I lay my case at your feet," he continued. "You are to be our
chief leader, and, on account of your illustrious birth and renowned
intelligence, will occupy a superior position in the council of
the notables. Is it not so? Has not the Señor Juez O'Brien so
ordained? You will give ear to me, you will alleviate my indignant
sufferings?" He implored me with his eyes for a long time.</p>

<p>Manuel-del-Popolo, as he called himself, pushed the hair back
from his forehead. I had noticed that the love-locks were plaited
with black braid, and that he wore large dirty silk ruffles.</p>

<p>"The <em>caballero</em>" he continued, marking his words with
a long, white finger a-tap on the table, "will represent my views
to the notables. My position at present, as I have had the honour
to observe, is become unbearable. Consider, too, how your worship
and I would work together. What lightness for you and me. You
will find this Castro unbearably gross. But I &mdash;I assure
you I am a man of taste&mdash;an <em>improvisador</em>&mdash;an artist.
My songs are celebrated. And yet!..."</p>

<p>He folded his arms again, and waited; then he said, employing
his most impressive voice:</p>

<p>"I have influence with the men of Rio. I could raise a riot.
We Cubans are a jealous people; we do not love that foreigners
should take our best from us. We do not love it; we will not suffer
it. Let this Castro bethink himself and go in peace, leaving us
and our ladies. As the proverb says, 'It is well to build a bridge
for a departing enemy.'"</p>

<p>He began to peer at me more wistfully, and his eyes grew more
luminous than ever. This man, in spite of his grotesqueness, was
quite in earnest, there was no doubting that.</p>

<p>"I have a gentle spirit," he began again, "a gentle spirit. I
am submissive to the legitimate authorities. What the Señor Juez
O'Brien asks me to do, I do. I would put a knife into any one
who inconvenienced the Señor Juez O'Brien, who is a good Catholic;
we would all do that, as is right and fitting. But this Castro&mdash;this
Andalou, who is nearly as bad as a heretic! When my day comes,
I will have his arms flayed and the soles of his feet, and I will
rub red pepper into them; and all the men of Rio who do not love
foreigners will applaud. And I will stick little thorns under
his tongue, and I will cut off his eyelids with little scissors,
and set him facing the sun. <em>Caballero</em>, you would love
me; I have a gentle spirit. I am a pleasant companion." He rose
and squeezed round the table. "Listen"&mdash;his eyes lit up with rapture&mdash;"you
shall hear me. It is divine&mdash;ah, it is very pleasant, you will
say."</p>

<p>He seized his mandolin, slung it round his neck, and leant against
the bulkhead. The bright light from the port-hole gilded the outlines
of his body, as he swayed about and moved his long fingers across
the strings; they tinkled metallically. He sang in a nasal voice:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Listen!' the young girls say as they hasten to the barred window.<br/>
'Listen! Ah, surely that is the guitar of Man&mdash;u&mdash;el&mdash;del-Popolo,<br/>
As he glides along the wall in the twilight.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>It was a very long song. He gesticulated freely with his hand
in between the scratching of the strings, which seemed to be a
matter of luck. His eyes gazed distantly at the wall above my
head. The performance bewildered and impressed me; I wondered
if this was what they had carried me off for. It was like being
mad. He made a decrescendo tinkling, and his lofty features lapsed
into their normal mournfulness.</p>

<p>At that moment Castro put his face round the door, then entered
altogether. He sighed in a satisfied manner, and had an air of
having finished a laborious undertaking.</p>

<p>"We have arranged the confusion up above," he said to Manuel-del-Popolo;
"you may go and see to the sailing. . . . Hurry; it is growing
late."</p>

<p>Manuel blazed silently, and stalked out of the door as if he
had an electric cloud round his head. Tomas Castro turned towards
me.</p>

<p>"You are better?" he asked benevolently. "You exerted yourself
too much. . . . But still, if you liked<hr>" He picked up the
mandolin, and began negligently scratching the strings. I noticed
an alteration in him; he had grown softer in the flesh in the
past years; there were little threads of gray in the knotted curls
of his beard. It was as if he had lived well, on the whole. He
bent his head over the strings, plucked one, tightened a peg,
plucked it again, then set the instrument on the table, and dropped
on to the mattress. "Will you have some rum?"  he said. "You have
grown broad and strong, like a bull.... You made those men fly,
<em>sacré nom d'une pipe</em>.... One would have thought you were
in earnest.... Ah, well!" He stretched himself at length on the
mattress, and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>I looked at him to discover traces of irony. There weren't any.
He was talking quietly; he even reproved me for having carried
the pretence of resistance beyond a joke.</p>

<p>"You fought too much; you struck many men&mdash;and hard. You will
have made enemies. The <em>picaros</em> of this dirty little town
are as conceited as pigs. You must take care, or you will have
a knife in your back."</p>

<p>He lay with his hands crossed on his stomach, which was round
like a pudding. After a time he opened his eyes, and looked at
the dancing white reflection of the water on the grimy ceiling.</p>

<p>"To think of seeing you again, after all these years," he said.
"I did not believe my ears when Don Carlos asked me to fetch you
like this. Who would have believed it? But, as they say," he added
philosophically, "'The water flows to the sea, and the little
stones find their places.'"  He paused to listen to the sounds
that came from above. "That Manuel is a fool," he said without
rancour; "he is mad with jealousy because for this day I have
command here. But, all the same, they are dangerous pigs, these
slaves of the Señor O'Brien. I wish the town were rid of them.
One day there will be a riot&mdash;a function&mdash;with their jealousies
and madness."</p>

<p>I sat and said nothing, and things fitted themselves together,
little patches of information going in here and there like the
pieces of a puzzle map. O'Brien had gone on to Havana in the ship
from which I had escaped, to render an account of the pirates
that had been hung at Kingston; the Riegos had been landed in
boats at Rio Medio, of course.</p>

<p>"That poor Don Carlos!" Castro moaned lamentably. "They had the
barbarity to take him out in the night, in that raw fog. He coughed
and coughed; it made me faint to hear him. He could not even speak
to me&mdash;his Tomas; it was pitiful. He could not speak when we got
to the Casa."</p>

<p>I could not really understand why I had been a second time kidnapped.
Castro said that O'Brien had not been unwilling that I should
reach Havana. It was Carlos that had ordered Tomas to take me
out of the <em>Breeze</em>. He had come down in the raw morning,
before the schooner had put out from behind the point, to impress
very elaborate directions upon Tomas Castro; indeed, it was whilst
talking to Tomas that he had burst a blood-vessel.</p>

<p>"He said to me: 'Have a care now. Listen. He is my dear friend,
that Señor Juan. I love him as if he were my only brother. Be
very careful, Tomas Castro. Make it appear that he comes to us
much against his will. Let him be dragged on board by many men.
You are to understand, Tomas, that he is a youth of noble family,
and that you are to be as careful of compromising him as you are
of the honour of Our Lady."!</p>

<p>Tomas Castro looked across at me. "You will be able to report
well of me," he said; "I did my best. If you are compromised,
it was you who did it by talking to me as if you knew me."</p>

<p>I remembered, then, that Tomas certainly had resented my seeming
to recognize him before Cowper and Lumsden. He closed his eyes
again. After a time he added:</p>

<p>"<em>Vaya!</em> After all, it is foolishness to fear being compromised.
You would never believe that his Excellency Don Balthasar had
led a riotous life&mdash;to look at him with his silver head. It is
said he had three friars killed once in Seville, a very, very
long time ago. It was dangerous in those days to come against
our Mother, the Church." He paused, and undid his shirt, laying
bare an incredibly hairy chest; then slowly kicked off his shoes.
"One stifles here," he said. "Ah! in the old days<hr>"</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned to me and said, with an air of indescribable
interest, as if he were gloating over an obscene idea:</p>

<p>"So they would hang a gentleman like you, if they caught you?
What savages you English people are!&mdash;what savages! Like cannibals!
You did well to make that comedy of resisting. <em>Quel pays!</em>...
What a people... I dream of them still.... The eyes; the teeth!
Ah, well! in an hour we shall be in Rio. I must sleep...."</p>
