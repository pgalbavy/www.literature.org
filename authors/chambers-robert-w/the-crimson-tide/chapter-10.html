<p>There was still, for Palla, much shopping to do. The drawing
room she decided to leave, for the present, caring as she did
only for a few genuine and beautiful pieces to furnish the pretty
little French grey room.</p>

<p>The purchase of these ought to be deferred, but she could look
about, and she did, wandering into antique shops of every class
along Fifth and Madison Avenues and the inviting cross streets.</p>

<p>But her chiefest quest was still for pots and pans and china;
for napery, bed linen, and hangings; also for her own and more
intimate personal attire.</p>

<p>To her the city was enchanting and not at all as she remembered
it before she had gone abroad.</p>

<p>New York, under its canopy of tossing flags and ablaze with brilliant
posters, swarmed with unfamiliar people. Every other pedestrian
seemed to be a soldier; every other vehicle contained a uniform.</p>

<p>There were innumerable varieties of military dress in the thronged
streets; there was the universal note of khaki and olive drab,
terminating in leather vizored barrack cap or jaunty overseas
service cap, and in spiral puttees, leather ones, or spurred boots.</p>

<p>Silver wings of aviators glimmered on athletic chests; chevrons,
wound stripes, service stripes, an endless variety of insignia.</p>

<p>Here the grey-green and oxidised metal of the marines predominated;
there, the conspicuous sage-green and gold of naval aviators.
On campaign hats were every hue of hat cord; the rich gilt and
blue of naval officers and the blue and white of their jackies
were everywhere to be encountered.</p>

<p>And then everywhere, also, the brighter hue and exotic cut of
foreign uniforms was apparent&mdash;splashes of gayer tints amid khaki
and sober civilian garb&mdash;the beautiful <em>garance</em> and horizon-blue
of French officers; the familiar "brass hat" of the British; the
grey-blue and maroon of Italians. And there were stranger uniforms
in varieties inexhaustible&mdash;the schapska-shaped head-gear of Polish
officers, the beret of Czecho-Slovaks. And everywhere, too, the
gay and well-known red pom-pon bobbed on the caps of French blue-jackets,
and British marines stalked in pairs, looking every inch the soldier
with their swagger sticks and their vizorless forage-caps.</p>

<p>Always, it seemed to Palla, there was military music to be heard
above the roar of traffic&mdash;sometimes the drums and bugles of foreign
detachments, arrived in aid of "drives" and loans of various sorts.</p>

<p>Ambulances painted grey and bright blue, and driven by smartly
uniformed young women, were everywhere.</p>

<p>And to women's uniforms there seemed no end, ranging all the
way from the sober blue of the army nurse and the pretty white
of the Red Cross, to bizarre but smart effects carried smartly
by well set up girls representing scores of service corps, some
invaluable, some of doubtful utility.</p>

<p>Eagle huts, canteens, soldiers' rest houses, Red Cross quarters,
clubs, temporary barracks, peppered the city. Everywhere the service
flags were visible, also, telling their proud stories in five-pointed
symbols&mdash;sometimes tragic, where gold stars glittered.</p>

<p>Never had New York seemed to contain so many people; never had
the overflow so congested avenue and street, circle and square,
and the wretchedly inadequate and dirty street-car and subway
service.</p>

<p>And into the heart of it all went Palla, engulfed in the great
tides of Fifth Avenue, drifting into quieter back-waters to east
and west, and sometimes caught and tossed about in the glittering
maelstrom of Broadway when she ventured into the theatre district.</p>

<p>Opera, comedy, musical show and cinema interested her; restaurant
and cabaret she had evaded, so far, but what most excited and
fascinated her was the people themselves&mdash;these eager, restless
moving millions swarming through the city day and night, always
in motion under blue skies or falling rain, perpetually in quest
of what the world eternally offered, eternally concealed&mdash;that
indefinite, glimmering thing called "heart's desire."</p>

<p>To discover, to comprehend, to help, to guide their myriad aspirations
in the interminable and headlong hunt for happiness, was, to Palla,
the most vital problem in the world.</p>

<p>For her there existed only one solution of this problem: the
Law of Love.</p>

<p>And in this world-wide Hunt for Happiness, where scrambling millions
followed the trail of Heart's Desire, she saw the mad huntsman,
Folly, leading, and Black Care, the whipper-in; and, at the bitter
end, only the bones of the world's woe; and a Horseman seated
on his Pale Horse.</p>

<p>But the problem that still remained was how to swerve the headlong
hunt to the true trail toward the only goal where the world's
quarry, happiness, lies asleep.</p>

<p>How to make service the Universal Heart's Desire? How to transfigure
self-love into Love?</p>

<p>To preach her faith from the street corners&mdash;to cry it aloud
in the wilderness where no ear heeded&mdash;violence, aggression, the
campaign militant, had never appealed to the girl.</p>

<p>Like her nation, only when cornered did she blaze out and strike.
But to harangue, threaten, demand of the world that it accept
the Law of Service and of Love, seemed to her a mockery of the
faith she had embraced, which, unless irrevocably in liaison with
freedom, was no faith at all.</p>

<p>So, for Palla, the solution lay in loyalty to the faith she professed;
in living it; in swaying ignorance by example; in overcoming incredulity
by service, scepticism by love.</p>

<p>Love and Service? Why, all around her among these teeming millions
were examples&mdash;volunteers in khaki, their sisters in the garments
of mercy! Why must the world stop there? This was the right scent.
Why should the hunt swerve for the devil's herring drawn across
the trail?</p>

<p>One for all; all for one! She had read it on one of the war-posters.
Somebody had taken the splendid Guardsman's creed and had made
it the slogan for this war against darkness.</p>

<p>And that was her creed&mdash;the true faith&mdash;the Law of Love. Then,
was it good only in war? Why not make it the nation's creed? Why
not emblazon it on the wall of every city on earth?&mdash;one for all;
all for one; Love, Service, Freedom!</p>

<p>Before such a faith, autocracy and tyranny die. Under such a
law every evil withers, every question is unravelled. There are
no more problems of poverty and riches, none of greed and oppression.</p>

<p>The tyranny of convention, of observance, of taboo, of folkways,
ends. And into the brain of all living beings will be born the
perfect comprehension of their own indestructible divinity.</p>

<p>Part of this she ventured to say to Ilse Westgard one day, when
they had met for luncheon in a modest tea-room on Forty-third
Street.</p>

<p>But Ilse, always inclined toward militancy, did not entirely
agree with Palla.</p>

<p>"To embody in one's daily life the principles of one's living
faith is scarcely sufficient," she said. "Good is a force, not
an inert condition. So is evil. And we should not sit still while
evil moves."</p>

<p>"Example is not inertia," protested Palla.</p>

<p>"Example, alone, is sterile, I think," said the ex-girl-soldier
of the Battalion of Death, buttering a crescent. She ate it with
the delightful appetite of flawless health, and poured out more
chocolate.</p>

<p>"For instance, dear," she went on, "the forces of evil&mdash;of degeneration,
ignorance, envy, ferocity, are gathering like a tornado in Russia.
Virtuous example, sucking its thumbs and minding its own business,
will be torn to fragments when the storm breaks."</p>

<p>"The Bolsheviki?"</p>

<p>"The Reds. The Terrorists, I mean. You know as well as I do what
they really are&mdash;merely looters skulking through the smoke of
a world in flames&mdash;buzzards on the carcass of a civilisation dead.
But, Palla, they do not sit still and suck their thumbs and say,
'I am a Terrorist. Behold me and be converted.' No, indeed! They
are moving, always in motion, preoccupied by their hellish designs."</p>

<p>"In Russia, yes," admitted Palla.</p>

<p>"Everywhere, dearest. Here, also."</p>

<p>"I believe there are scarcely any in America," insisted Palla.</p>

<p>"The country crawls with them," retorted Ilse. "They work like
moles, but already if you look about you can see the earth stirring
above their tunnels. They are here, everywhere, active, scheming,
plotting, whispering treason, stirring discontent, inciting envy,
teaching treason.</p>

<p>"They are the Russians &mdash;Christians and Jews&mdash;who have filtered
in here to do the nation mischief. They are the Germans who blew
up factories, set fires, scuttled ships. They are foreigners who
came here poisoned with envy; who have acquired nothing; whose
greed and ferocity are whetted and ready for a universal conflagration
by which they alone could profit.</p>

<p>"They are the labour leaders who break faith and incite to violence;
they are the I. W. W.; they are the Black Hand, the Camorra; they
are the penniless who would slay and rob; the landless who would
kill and seize; the ignorant, nursing suspicion; the shiftless,
brooding crimes to bring them riches quickly.</p>

<p>"And, Palla, your Law of Love and Service is good. But not for
these."</p>

<p>"What law for them, then?"</p>

<p>"Education. Maybe with machine guns."</p>

<p>Palla shook her head. "Is that the way to educate defectives?"</p>

<p>"When they come at you <em>en masse</em>, yes!"</p>

<p>Palla laughed. "Dear," she said, "there is no nation-wide Terrorist
plot. These mental defectives are not in mass anywhere in America."</p>

<p>"They are in dangerous groups everywhere. And every group is
devoting its cunning to turning the working masses into a vast
mob of the Black Hundred! They did it in Russia. They are working
for it all over the world. You do not believe it?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't, Ilse."</p>

<p>"Very well. You shall come with me this evening. Are you busy?"</p>

<p>The thought of Jim glimmered in her mind. He might feel aggrieved.
But he ought to begin to realise that he couldn't be with her
every evening.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't any plans, Ilse," she said, "no definite engagement,
I mean. Will you dine at home with me?"</p>

<p>"Early, then. Because there is a meeting which you and I shall
attend. It is an education."</p>

<p>"An anarchist meeting?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Reds. I think we should go&mdash;perhaps take part&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Why not? I shall not listen to lies and remain silent!" said
Ilse, laughing. "The Revolution was good. But the Bolsheviki are
nothing but greedy thieves and murderers. You and I know that.
If anybody teaches people the contrary, I certainly shall have
something to say."</p>

<p>Palla desired to purchase silk for sofa pillows, having acquired
a chaise-longue for her bedroom.</p>

<p>So she and Ilse went out into the sunshine and multi-coloured
crowd; and all the afternoon they shopped very blissfully&mdash;which
meant, also, lingering before store windows, drifting into picture-galleries,
taking tea at Sherry's, and finally setting out for home through
a beflagged avenue jammed with traffic.</p>

<p>Dusk fell early but the drooping, orange-tinted globes which
had replaced the white ones on the Fifth Avenue lamps were not
yet lighted; and there still remained a touch of sunset in the
sky when they left the bus.</p>

<p>At the corner of Palla's street, there seemed to be an unusual
congestion, and now, above the noise of traffic, they caught the
sound of a band; and turned at the curb to see, supposing it to
be a military music.</p>

<p>The band was a full one, not military, wearing a slatternly sort
of uniform but playing well enough as they came up through the
thickening dusk, marching close to the eastern curb of the avenue.</p>

<p>They were playing <em>The Marseillaise</em>. Four abreast, behind
them, marched a dingy column of men and women, mostly of foreign
aspect and squatty build, carrying a flag which seemed to be entirely
red.</p>

<p>Palla, perplexed, incredulous, yet almost instantly suspecting
the truth, stared at the rusty ranks, at the knots of red ribbon
on every breast.</p>

<p>Other people were staring, too, as the unexpected procession
came shuffling along&mdash;late shoppers, business men returning home,
soldiers&mdash;all paused to gaze at this sullen visaged battalion
clumping up the avenue.</p>

<p>"Surely," said Palla to Ilse, "these people can't be Reds!"</p>

<p>"Surely they are!" returned the tall, fair girl calmly. Her face
had become flushed, and she stepped to the edge of the curb, her
blue, wrathful eyes darkening like sapphires.</p>

<p>A soldier came up beside her. Others, sailors and soldiers, stopped
to look. There was a red flag passing. Suddenly Ilse stepped from
the sidewalk, wrenched the flag from the burly Jew who carried
it, and, with the same movement, shattered the staff across her
knee.</p>

<p>Men and women in the ranks closed in on her; a shrill roar rose
from them, but the soldiers and sailors, cheering and laughing,
broke into the enraged ranks, tearing off red rosettes, cuffing
and kicking the infuriated Terrorists, seizing every seditious
banner, flag, emblem and placard in sight.</p>

<p>Female Reds, shrieking with rage, clawed, kicked and bit at soldier,
sailor and civilian. A gaunt man, with a greasy bunch of hair
under a bowler, waved dirty hands above the mêlée and shouted
that he had the Mayor's permission to parade.</p>

<p>Everywhere automobiles were stopping, crowds of people hurrying
up, policemen running. The electric lights snapped alight, revealed
a mob struggling there in the yellowish glare.</p>

<p>Ilse had calmly stepped to the sidewalk, the fragments of flag
and staff in her white-gloved hands; and, as she saw the irresponsible
soldiers and blue-jackets wading lustily into the Reds&mdash;saw the
lively riot which her own action had started&mdash;an irresistible
desire to laugh seized her.</p>

<p>Clear and gay above the yelling of Bolsheviki and the "Yip&mdash;yip!"
of the soldiers, peeled her infectious laughter. But Palla, more
gentle, stood with dark eyes dilated, fearful of real bloodshed
in the furious scene raging in the avenue before her.</p>

<p>A little shrimp of a Terrorist, a huge red rosette streaming
from his buttonhole, suddenly ran at Ilse and seized the broken
staff and the rags of the red flag. And Palla, alarmed, caught
him by the coat-collar and dragged him screeching and cursing
away from her friend, rebuking him in a firm but excited voice.</p>

<p>Ilse came over, shouldering her superb figure through the crowd;
looked at the human shrimp a moment; then her laughter pealed
anew.</p>

<p>"That's the man who abused me in Denmark!" she said. "Oh, Palla,
<em>look</em> at him! Do you really believe you could educate
a thing like that!"</p>

<p>The man had wriggled free, and now he turned a flat, whiskered
visage on Palla, menaced her with both soiled fists, inarticulate
in his fury.</p>

<p>But police were everywhere, now, sweeping this miniature riot
from the avenue, hustling the Reds uptown, checking the skylarking
soldiery, sending amused or indignant citizens about their business.</p>

<p>A burly policeman said to Ilse with a grin: "I'll take what's
left of that red flag, Miss;" and the girl handed it to him still
laughing.</p>

<p>Soldiers wearing overseas caps cheered her and Palla. Everybody
on the turbulent sidewalk was now laughing.</p>

<p>"D'yeh see that blond nab the red flag outer that big kike's
fists?" shouted one soldier to his sweating bunkie. "Some skirt!"</p>

<p>"God love the Bolsheviki she grabs by the slack o' the pants!"
cried a blue-jacket who had lost his cap. A roar followed.</p>

<p>"Only one flag in this little old town!" yelled a citizen nursing
a cut cheek with reddened handkerchief.</p>

<p>"G'wan, now!" grumbled a policeman, trying to look severe; "it's
all over; they's nothing to see. Av ye got homes&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yip! Where do we go from here?" demanded a marine.</p>

<p>"Home!" repeated the policeman; "&mdash;that's the answer. G'wan,
now, peaceable&mdash;lave these ladies pass!&#11834;"</p>

<p>Ilse and Palla, still walled in by a grinning, admiring soldiery,
took advantage of the opening and fled, followed by cheers as
far as Palla's door.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Ilse," she exclaimed in fresh dismay, as she began
to realise the rather violent rôles they both had played, "&mdash;is
that your idea of education for the masses?"</p>

<p>A servant answered the bell and they entered the house. And presently,
seated on the chaise-longue in Palla's bedroom, Ilse Westgard
alternately gazed upon her ruined white gloves and leaned against
the cane back, weak with laughter.</p>

<p>"How funny! How degrading! But how funny!" she kept repeating.
"That large and enraged Jew with the red flag!&mdash;the wretched little
Christian shrimp you carried wriggling away by the collar! Oh,
Palla! Palla! Never shall I forget the expression on your face&mdash;like
a bored housewife, who, between thumb and forefinger, carries
a dead mouse by the tail&#11834;"</p>

<p>"He was trying to kick you, my dear," explained Palla, beginning
to remove the hairpins from her hair.</p>

<p>Ilse touched her eyes with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"They might have thrown bombs," she said. "It's all very well
to laugh, darling, but sometimes such affairs are not funny."</p>

<p>Palla, seated at her dresser, shook down a mass of thick, bright-brown
hair, and picked up her comb.</p>

<p>"I am wondering," she said, turning partly toward Ilse, "what
Jim Shotwell would think of me."</p>

<p>"Fighting on the street!"&mdash;her laughter rang out uncontrolled.
And Palla, too, was laughing rather uncertainly, for, as her recollection
of the affair became more vivid, her doubts concerning the entire
procedure increased.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, "that red flag was outrageous, and you
were quite right in destroying it. One could hardly buttonhole
such a procession and try to educate it."</p>

<p>Ilse said: "One can usually educate a wild animal, but never
a rabid one. You'll see, to-night."</p>

<p>"Where are we going, dear?"</p>

<p>"We are going to a place just west of Seventh Avenue, called
the Red Flag Club."</p>

<p>"Is it a club?"</p>

<p>"No. The Reds hire it several times a week and try to fill it
with people. There is the menace to this city and to the nation,
Palla&mdash;for these cunning fomenters of disorder deluge the poorer
quarters of the town with their literature. That's where they
get their audiences. And that is where are being born the seeds
of murder and destruction."</p>

<p>Palla, combing out her hair, gazed absently into the mirror.</p>

<p>"Why should not we do the same thing?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Form a club, rent a room, and talk to people?"</p>

<p>"Yes; why not?" asked Palla.</p>

<p>"That is exactly why I wish you to come with me to-night&mdash;to
realise how we should combat these criminal and insane agents
of all that is most terrible in Europe.</p>

<p>"And you are right, Palla; that is the way to fight them. That
is the way to neutralise the poison they are spreading. That is
the way to educate the masses to that sane socialism in which
we both believe. It can be done by education. It can be done by
matching them with club for club, meeting for meeting, speech
for speech. And when, in some local instances, it can not be done
that way, then, if there be disorder, force!"</p>

<p>"It can be done entirely by education," said Palla. "But remember!
&mdash;Marx gave the forces of disorder their slogan&mdash;'Unite!'
Only a rigid organisation of sane civilisation can meet that menace."</p>

<p>"You are very right, darling, and a club to combat the Bolsheviki
already exists. Vanya and Marya already have joined; there are
workmen and working women, college professors and college graduates
among its members. Some, no doubt, will be among the audience
at the Red Flag Club to-night.</p>

<p>"I shall join this club. I think you, also, will wish to enroll.
It is called only 'Number One.' Other clubs are to be organised
and numbered.</p>

<p>"And now you see that, in America, the fight against organised
rascality and exploited insanity has really begun."</p>

<p>Palla, her hair under discipline once more, donned a fresh but
severe black gown. Ilse unpinned her hat, made a vigorous toilet,
then lighted a cigarette and sauntered into the living room where
the telephone was ringing persistently.</p>

<p>"Please answer," said Palla, fastening her gown before the pier
glass.</p>

<p>Presently Ilse called her: "It's Mr. Shotwell, dear."</p>

<p>Palla came into the room and picked up the receiver:</p>

<p>"Yes? Oh, good evening, Jim! Yes.... Yes, I am going out with
Ilse.... Why, no, I had no engagement with you, Jim! I'm sorry,
but I didn't understand &mdash;No; I had no idea that you expected
to see me&mdash;wait a moment, please!"&mdash;she put one hand over the
transmitter, turned to Ilse with flushed cheeks and a shyly interrogative
smile: "Shall I ask him to dine with us and go with us?"</p>

<p>"If you choose," called Ilse, faintly amused.</p>

<p>Then Palla called him: " &mdash;Jim! Come to dinner at once.
And wear your business clothes.... What?... Yes, your every day
clothes.... What?... Why, because I ask you, Jim. Isn't that a
reason?... Thank you.... Yes, come immediately.... Good-bye, de&#11834;"</p>

<p>She coloured crimson, hung up the receiver, and picked up the
evening paper, not daring to glance at Ilse.</p>
