<p>When he stepped off the straight and narrow path of his peculiar
honesty, it was with an inward assertion of unflinching resolve
to fall back again into the monotonous but safe stride of virtue
as soon as his little excursion into the wayside quagmires had
produced the desired effect. It was going to be a short episode&mdash;a
sentence in brackets, so to speak&mdash;in the flowing tale of his
life: a thing of no moment, to be done unwillingly, yet neatly,
and to be quickly forgotten. He imagined that he could go on afterwards
looking at the sunshine, enjoying the shade, breathing in the
perfume of flowers in the small garden before his house. He fancied
that nothing would be changed, that he would be able as heretofore
to tyrannize good-humouredly over his half-caste wife, to notice
with tender contempt his pale yellow child, to patronize loftily
his dark-skinned brother-in-law, who loved pink neckties and wore
patent-leather boots on his little feet, and was so humble before
the white husband of the lucky sister. Those were the delights
of his life, and he was unable to conceive that the moral significance
of any act of his could interfere with the very nature of things,
could dim the light of the sun, could destroy the perfume of the
flowers, the submission of his wife, the smile of his child, the
awe-struck respect of Leonard da Souza and of all the Da Souza
family. That family’s admiration was the great luxury of his life.
It rounded and completed his existence in a perpetual assurance
of unquestionable superiority. He loved to breathe the coarse
incense they offered before the shrine of the successful white
man; the man that had done them the honour to marry their daughter,
sister, cousin; the rising man sure to climb very high; the confidential
clerk of Hudig &amp; Co. They were a numerous and an unclean crowd,
living in ruined bamboo houses, surrounded by neglected compounds,
on the outskirts of Macassar. He kept them at arm’s length and
even further off, perhaps, having no illusions as to their worth.
They were a half-caste, lazy lot, and he saw them as they were&mdash;ragged,
lean, unwashed, undersized men of various ages, shuffling about
aimlessly in slippers; motionless old women who looked like monstrous
bags of pink calico stuffed with shapeless lumps of fat, and deposited
askew upon decaying rattan chairs in shady corners of dusty verandahs;
young women, slim and yellow, big-eyed, long-haired, moving languidly
amongst the dirt and rubbish of their dwellings as if every step
they took was going to be their very last. He heard their shrill
quarrellings, the squalling of their children, the grunting of
their pigs; he smelt the odours of the heaps of garbage in their
courtyards: and he was greatly disgusted. But he fed and clothed
that shabby multitude; those degenerate descendants of Portuguese
conquerors; he was their providence; he kept them singing his
praises in the midst of their laziness, of their dirt, of their
immense and hopeless squalor: and he was greatly delighted. They
wanted much, but he could give them all they wanted without ruining
himself. In exchange he had their silent fear, their loquacious
love, their noisy veneration. It is a fine thing to be a providence,
and to be told so on every day of one’s life. It gives one a feeling
of enormously remote superiority, and Willems revelled in it.
He did not analyze the state of his mind, but probably his greatest
delight lay in the unexpressed but intimate conviction that, should
he close his hand, all those admiring human beings would starve.
His munificence had demoralized them. An easy task. Since he descended
amongst them and married Joanna they had lost the little aptitude
and strength for work they might have had to put forth under the
stress of extreme necessity. They lived now by the grace of his
will. This was power. Willems loved it. In another, and perhaps
a lower plane, his days did not want for their less complex but
more obvious pleasures. He liked the simple games of skill&mdash;billiards;
also games not so simple, and calling for quite another kind of
skill&mdash;poker. He had been the aptest pupil of a steady-eyed, sententious
American, who had drifted mysteriously into Macassar from the
wastes of the Pacific, and, after knocking about for a time in
the eddies of town life, had drifted out enigmatically into the
sunny solitudes of the Indian Ocean. The memory of the Californian
stranger was perpetuated in the game of poker&mdash;which became popular
in the capital of Celebes from that time&mdash;and in a powerful cocktail,
the recipe for which is transmitted&mdash;in the Kwang-tung dialect&mdash;from
head boy to head boy of the Chinese servants in the Sunda Hotel
even to this day. Willems was a connoisseur in the drink and an
adept at the game. Of those accomplishments he was moderately
proud. Of the confidence reposed in him by Hudig&mdash;the master&mdash;he
was boastfully and obtrusively proud. This arose from his great
benevolence, and from an exalted sense of his duty to himself
and the world at large. He experienced that irresistible impulse
to impart information which is inseparable from gross ignorance.
There is always some one thing which the ignorant man knows, and
that thing is the only thing worth knowing; it fills the ignorant
man’s universe. Willems knew all about himself. On the day when,
with many misgivings, he ran away from a Dutch East-Indiaman in
Samarang roads, he had commenced that study of himself, of his
own ways, of his own abilities, of those fate-compelling qualities
of his which led him toward that lucrative position which he now
filled. Being of a modest and diffident nature, his successes
amazed, almost frightened him, and ended&mdash;as he got over the succeeding
shocks of surprise&mdash;by making him ferociously conceited. He believed
in his genius and in his knowledge of the world. Others should
know of it also; for their own good and for his greater glory.
All those friendly men who slapped him on the back and greeted
him noisily should have the benefit of his example. For that he
must talk. He talked to them conscientiously. In the afternoon
he expounded his theory of success over the little tables, dipping
now and then his moustache in the crushed ice of the cocktails;
in the evening he would often hold forth, cue in hand, to a young
listener across the billiard table. The billiard balls stood still
as if listening also, under the vivid brilliance of the shaded
oil lamps hung low over the cloth; while away in the shadows of
the big room the Chinaman marker would lean wearily against the
wall, the blank mask of his face looking pale under the mahogany
marking-board; his eyelids dropped in the drowsy fatigue of late
hours and in the buzzing monotony of the unintelligible stream
of words poured out by the white man. In a sudden pause of the
talk the game would recommence with a sharp click and go on for
a time in the flowing soft whirr and the subdued thuds as the
balls rolled zig-zagging towards the inevitably successful cannon.
Through the big windows and the open doors the salt dampness of
the sea, the vague smell of mould and flowers from the garden
of the hotel drifted in and mingled with the odour of lamp oil,
growing heavier as the night advanced. The players’ heads dived
into the light as they bent down for the stroke, springing back
again smartly into the greenish gloom of broad lamp-shades; the
clock ticked methodically; the unmoved Chinaman continuously repeated
the score in a lifeless voice, like a big talking doll&mdash;and Willems
would win the game. With a remark that it was getting late, and
that he was a married man, he would say a patronizing good-night
and step out into the long, empty street. At that hour its white
dust was like a dazzling streak of moonlight where the eye sought
repose in the dimmer gleam of rare oil lamps. Willems walked homewards,
following the line of walls overtopped by the luxuriant vegetation
of the front gardens. The houses right and left were hidden behind
the black masses of flowering shrubs. Willems had the street to
himself. He would walk in the middle, his shadow gliding obsequiously
before him. He looked down on it complacently. The shadow of a
successful man! He would be slightly dizzy with the cocktails
and with the intoxication of his own glory. As he often told people,
he came east fourteen years ago&mdash;a cabin boy. A small boy. His
shadow must have been very small at that time; he thought with
a smile that he was not aware then he had anything&mdash;even a shadow&mdash;which
he dared call his own. And now he was looking at the shadow of
the confidential clerk of Hudig &amp; Co. going home. How glorious!
How good was life for those that were on the winning side! He
had won the game of life; also the game of billiards. He walked
faster, jingling his winnings, and thinking of the white stone
days that had marked the path of his existence. He thought of
the trip to Lombok for ponies&mdash;that first important transaction
confided to him by Hudig; then he reviewed the more important
affairs: the quiet deal in opium; the illegal traffic in gunpowder;
the great affair of smuggled firearms, the difficult business
of the Rajah of Goak. He carried that last through by sheer pluck;
he had bearded the savage old ruler in his council room; he had
bribed him with a gilt glass coach, which, rumour said, was used
as a hen-coop now; he had over-persuaded him; he had bested him
in every way. That was the way to get on. He disapproved of the
elementary dishonesty that dips the hand in the cash-box, but
one could evade the laws and push the principles of trade to their
furthest consequences. Some call that cheating. Those are the
fools, the weak, the contemptible. The wise, the strong, the respected,
have no scruples. Where there are scruples there can be no power.
On that text he preached often to the young men. It was his doctrine,
and he, himself, was a shining example of its truth.</p>

<p>Night after night he went home thus, after a day of toil and
pleasure, drunk with the sound of his own voice celebrating his
own prosperity. On his thirtieth birthday he went home thus. He
had spent in good company a nice, noisy evening, and, as he walked
along the empty street, the feeling of his own greatness grew
upon him, lifted him above the white dust of the road, and filled
him with exultation and regrets. He had not done himself justice
over there in the hotel, he had not talked enough about himself,
he had not impressed his hearers enough. Never mind. Some other
time. Now he would go home and make his wife get up and listen
to him. Why should she not get up?&mdash;and mix a cocktail for him&mdash;and
listen patiently. Just so. She shall. If he wanted he could make
all the Da Souza family get up. He had only to say a word and
they would all come and sit silently in their night vestments
on the hard, cold ground of his compound and listen, as long as
he wished to go on explaining to them from the top of the stairs,
how great and good he was. They would. However, his wife would
do&mdash;for to-night.</p>

<p>His wife! He winced inwardly. A dismal woman with startled eyes
and dolorously drooping mouth, that would listen to him in pained
wonder and mute stillness. She was used to those night-discourses
now. She had rebelled once&mdash;at the beginning. Only once. Now,
while he sprawled in the long chair and drank and talked, she
would stand at the further end of the table, her hands resting
on the edge, her frightened eyes watching his lips, without a
sound, without a stir, hardly breathing, till he dismissed her
with a contemptuous: "Go to bed, dummy." She would draw a long
breath then and trail out of the room, relieved but unmoved. Nothing
could startle her, make her scold or make her cry. She did not
complain, she did not rebel. That first difference of theirs was
decisive. Too decisive, thought Willems, discontentedly. It had
frightened the soul out of her body apparently. A dismal woman!
A damn’d business altogether! What the devil did he want to go
and saddle himself. . . . Ah! Well! he wanted a home, and the
match seemed to please Hudig, and Hudig gave him the bungalow,
that flower-bowered house to which he was wending his way in the
cool moonlight. And he had the worship of the Da Souza tribe.
A man of his stamp could carry off anything, do anything, aspire
to anything. In another five years those white people who attended
the Sunday card-parties of the Governor would accept him&mdash;half-caste
wife and all! Hooray! He saw his shadow dart forward and wave
a hat, as big as a rum barrel, at the end of an arm several yards
long. . . . Who shouted hooray? . . . He smiled shamefacedly to
himself, and, pushing his hands deep into his pockets, walked
faster with a suddenly grave face. Behind him&mdash;to the left&mdash;a
cigar end glowed in the gateway of Mr. Vinck’s front yard. Leaning
against one of the brick pillars, Mr. Vinck, the cashier of Hudig
&amp; Co., smoked the last cheroot of the evening. Amongst the
shadows of the trimmed bushes Mrs. Vinck crunched slowly, with
measured steps, the gravel of the circular path before the house.</p>

<p>"There’s Willems going home on foot&mdash;and drunk I fancy," said
Mr. Vinck over his shoulder. "I saw him jump and wave his hat."</p>

<p>The crunching of the gravel stopped.</p>

<p>"Horrid man," said Mrs. Vinck, calmly. "I have heard he beats
his wife."</p>

<p>"Oh no, my dear, no," muttered absently Mr. Vinck, with a vague
gesture. The aspect of Willems as a wife-beater presented to him
no interest. How women do misjudge! If Willems wanted to torture
his wife he would have recourse to less primitive methods. Mr.
Vinck knew Willems well, and believed him to be very able, very
smart&mdash;objectionably so. As he took the last quick draws at the
stump of his cheroot, Mr. Vinck reflected that the confidence
accorded by Hudig to Willems was open, under the circumstances,
to loyal criticism from Hudig’s cashier.</p>

<p>"He is becoming dangerous; he knows too much. He will have to
be got rid of," said Mr. Vinck aloud. But Mrs. Vinck had gone
in already, and after shaking his head he threw away his cheroot
and followed her slowly.</p>

<p>Willems walked on homeward weaving the splendid web of his future.
The road to greatness lay plainly before his eyes, straight and
shining, without any obstacle that he could see. He had stepped
off the path of honesty, as he understood it, but he would soon
regain it, never to leave it any more! It was a very small matter.
He would soon put it right again. Meantime his duty was not to
be found out, and he trusted in his skill, in his luck, in his
well-established reputation that would disarm suspicion if anybody
dared to suspect. But nobody would dare! True, he was conscious
of a slight deterioration. He had appropriated temporarily some
of Hudig’s money. A deplorable necessity. But he judged himself
with the indulgence that should be extended to the weaknesses
of genius. He would make reparation and all would be as before;
nobody would be the loser for it, and he would go on unchecked
toward the brilliant goal of his ambition.</p>

<p>Hudig’s partner!</p>

<p>Before going up the steps of his house he stood for awhile, his
feet well apart, chin in hand, contemplating mentally Hudig’s
future partner. A glorious occupation. He saw him quite safe;
solid as the hills; deep&mdash;deep as an abyss; discreet as the grave.</p>
