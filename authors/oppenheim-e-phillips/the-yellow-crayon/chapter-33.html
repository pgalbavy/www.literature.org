<P>
The greeting between the two men was cold, and the Prince almost
immediately stepped between them.  Nevertheless, Brott seemed
to have a fancy to talk with Mr. Sabin.
<P>
"I was at Camperdown House yesterday," he remarked.  "Her Ladyship
was regretting that she saw you so seldom."
<P>
"I have been a little remiss," Mr. Sabin answered.  "I hope to lunch
there to-morrow."
<P>
"You have seen the evening paper, Brott?" the Prince asked.
<P>
"I saw the early editions," Brott answered.  "Is there anything
fresh?"
<P>
The Prince dropped his voice a little.  He drew Brott on one side.
<P>
"The Westminster declared that you had left for Windsor by an early
train this afternoon, and gives a list of your Cabinet.  The Pall
Mall, on the other hand, declares that Letheringham will assuredly
be sent for to-morrow."
<P>
Brott shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"There are bound to be a crop of such reports at a time like this,"
he remarked.
<P>
The Prince dropped his voice almost to a whisper.
<P>
"Brott," he said, "there is something which I have had it in my
mind to say to you for the last few days.  I am not perhaps a great
politician, but, like many outsiders, I see perhaps a good deal of
the game.  I know fairly well what the feeling is in Vienna and
Berlin.  I can give you a word of advice."
<P>
"You are very kind, Prince," Brott remarked, looking uneasily over
his shoulder.  "But - "
<P>
"It is concerning Brand.  There is no man more despised and disliked
abroad, not only because he is a Jew and ill-bred, but because of
his known sympathy with some of these anarchists who are perfect
firebrands in Europe."
<P>
"I am exceedingly obliged to you," Brott answered hurriedly.  "I am
afraid, however, that you anticipate matters a good deal.  I have
not yet been asked to form a Cabinet.  It is doubtful whether I ever
shall.  And, beyond that, it is also doubtful whether even if I am
asked I shall accept."
<P>
"I must confess," the Prince said, "that you puzzle me.  Every one
says that the Premiership of the country is within your reach.  It
is surely the Mecca of all politicians."
<P>
"There are complications," Brott muttered.  "You - "
<P>
He stopped short and moved towards the door.  Lucille, unusually
pale and grave, had just issued from the ladies' ante-room, and
joined Lady Carey, who was talking to Mr. Sabin.  She touched the
latter lightly on the arm.
<P>
"Help us to escape," she said quickly.  "I am weary of my task.
Can we get away without their seeing us?"
<P>
Mr. Sabin offered his arm.  They passed along the broad way, and
as they were almost the last to leave the place, their carriage
was easily found.  The Prince and Mr. Brott appeared only in time
to see Mr. Sabin turning away, hat in hand, from the curb-stone.
Brott's face darkened.
<P>
"Prince," he said, "who is that man?"
<P>
The Prince shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"A man," he said, "who has more than once nearly ruined your
country.  His life has been a splendid failure.  He would have
given India to the Russians, but they mistrusted him and trifled
away their chance.  Once since then he nearly sold this country
to Germany; it was a trifle only which intervened.  He has been
all his life devoted to one cause."
<P>
"And that?" Brott asked.
<P>
"The restoration of the monarchy to France.  He, as you of course
know, is the Duc de Souspennier, the sole living member in the
direct line of one of the most ancient and historical houses in
England.  My friend," he added, turning to Mr. Sabin, "you have
stolen a march upon us.  We had not even an opportunity of making
our adieux to the ladies."
<P>
"I imagine," Mr. Sabin answered, "that the cause of quarrel may
rest with them.  You were nowhere in sight when they came out."
<P>
"These fascinating politics," the Prince remarked.  "We all want
to talk politics to Mr. Brott just now."
<P>
"I will wish you good-night, gentlemen," Mr. Sabin said, and passed
into the hotel.
<P>
The Prince touched Brott on the arm.
<P>
"Will you come round to the club, and take a hand at bridge?" he said.
<P>
Brott laughed shortly.
<P>
"I imagine," he said, "that I should be an embarrassing guest to
you just now at, say the Mallborough, or even at the St. James.
I believe the aristocracy are looking forward to the possibility of
my coming into power with something like terror."
<P>
"I am not thoroughly versed; in the politics of this country," the
Prince said, "but I have always understood that your views were
very much advanced.  Dorset solemnly believes that you are pledged
to exterminate the large landed proprietors, and I do not think he
would be surprised to hear that you had a guillotine up your sleeve."
<P>
The two men were strolling along Pall Mall.  The Prince had lit a
large cigar, and was apparently on the best of terms with himself
and the world in general.  Brott, on the contrary, was most unlike
himself, preoccupied, and apparently ill at ease.
<P>
"The Duke and his class are, of course, my natural opponents," Brott
said shortly.  "By the bye, Prince," he added, suddenly turning
towards him, and with a complete change of tone, "it is within your
power to do me a favour."
<P>
"You have only to command," the Prince assured him good-naturedly.
<P>
"My rooms are close here," Brott continued.  "Will you accompany
me there, and grant me the favour of a few minutes' conversation?"
<P>
"Assuredly!" the Prince answered, flicking the end off his cigar.
"It will be a pleasure."
<P>
They walked on towards their destination in silence.  Brott's
secretary was in the library with a huge pile of letters and
telegrams before him.  He welcomed Brott with relief.
<P>
"We have been sending all over London for you, sir," he said.
<P>
Brott nodded.
<P>
"I am better out of the way for the present," he answered.  "Deny
me to everybody for an hour, especially Letheringham.  There is
nothing here, I suppose, which cannot wait so long as that?"
<P>
The secretary looked a little doubtful.
<P>
"I think not, sir," he decided.
<P>
"Very good.  Go and get something to eat.  You look fagged.  And
tell Hyson to bring up some liqueurs, will you!  I shall be engaged
for a short time."
<P>
The secretary withdrew.  A servant appeared with a little tray of
liqueurs, and in obedience to an impatient gesture from his master,
left them upon the table.  Brott closed the door firmly.
<P>
"Prince," he said, resuming his seat, "I wished to speak with you
concerning the Countess."
<P>
Saxe Leinitzer nodded.
<P>
"All right," he said.  "I am listening!"
<P>
"I understand," Brott continued, "that you are one of her oldest
friends, and also one of the trustees of her estates.  I presume
that you stand to her therefore to some extent in the position of
an adviser?"
<P>
"It is perfectly true," the Prince admitted.
<P>
"I, too, am an old friend, as she has doubtless told you," Brott
said.  "All my life she has been the one woman whom I have desired
to call my wife.  That desire has never been so strong as at the
present moment."
<P>
The Prince removed his cigar from his mouth and looked grave.
<P>
"But, my dear Brott," he said, "have you considered the enormous
gulf between your - views?  The Countess owns great hereditary
estates, she comes from a family which is almost Royal, she herself
is an aristocrat to the backbone.  It is a class against which you
have declared war.  How can you possibly come together on common
ground?"
<P>
Brott was silent for a moment.  Looking at him steadily the Prince
was surprised at the change in the man's appearance.  His cheeks
seemed blanched and his skin drawn.  He had lost flesh, his eyes
were hollow, and he frequently betrayed in small mannerisms a
nervousness wholly new and unfamiliar to him.
<P>
"You speak as a man of sense, Prince," he said after a while.  "You
are absolutely correct.  This matter has caused me a great deal of
anxious thought.  To falter at this moment is to lose, politically,
all that I have worked for all my life.  It is to lose the confidence
of the people who have trusted me.  It is a betrayal, the thought of
which is a constant shame to me.  But, on the other hand, Lucille
is the dearest thing to me in life."
<P>
The Prince's expression was wholly sympathetic.  The derision which
lurked behind he kept wholly concealed.  A strong man so abjectly
in the toils, and he to be chosen for his confidant!  It was
melodrama with a dash of humour.
<P>
"If I am to help you," the Prince said, "I must know everything.
Have you made any proposals to Lucille?  In plain words, how much
of your political future are you disposed to sacrifice?"
<P>
"All!" Brott said hoarsely.  "All for a certainty of her.  Not
one jot without."
<P>
"And she?"
<P>
Brott sprang to his feet, white and nervous.
<P>
"It is where I am at fault," he exclaimed.  "It is why I have asked
for your advice, your help perhaps.  I do not find it easy to
understand Lucille.  Perhaps it is because I am not well versed in
the ways of her sex.  I find her elusive.  She will give me no
promise.  Before I went to Glasgow I talked with her.  If she
would have married me then my political career was over - thrown on
one side like an old garment.  But she would give me no promise.
In everything save the spoken words I crave she has promised me her
love.  Again there comes a climax.  In a few hours I must make my
final choice.  I must decline to join Letheringham, in which case
the King must send for me, or accept office with him, and throw away
the one great chance of this generation.  Letheringham's Cabinet,
of course, would be a moderate Liberal one, a paragon of milk and
water in effectiveness.  If I go in alone we make history.  The
moment of issue has come.  And, Prince, although I have pleaded
with all the force and all the earnestness I know, Lucille remains
elusive.  If I choose for her side - she promises me - reward.  But
it is vague to me.  I don't, I can't understand!  I want her for my
wife, I want her for the rest of my life - nothing else.  Tell me,
is there any barrier to this?  There are no complications in her
life which I do not know of?  I want your assurance.  I want her
promise.  You understand me?"
<P>
"Yes, I understand you," the Prince said gravely.  "I understand
more than you do.  I understand Lucille's position."
<P>
Brott leaned forward with bright eyes.
<P>
"Ah!"
<P>
<P>
"Lucille, the Countess of Radantz, is at the present moment a
married woman."
<P>
Brott was speechless.  His face was like a carved stone image,
from which the life had wholly gone.
<P>
"Her husband - in name only, let me tell you, is the Mr. Sabin
with whom we had supper this evening."
<P>
"Great God!"
<P>
"Their marriage had strange features in it which are not my concern,
or even yours," the Prince said deliberately.  "The truth is, that
they have not lived together for years, they never will again, for
their divorce proceedings would long ago have been concluded but
for the complications arising from the difference between the
Hungarian and the American laws.  Here, without doubt, is the reason
why the Countess has hesitated to pledge her word directly."
<P>
"It is wonderful," Brott said slowly.  "But it explains everything."
<P>
There was a loud knock at the door.  The secretary appeared upon
the threshold.  Behind him was a tall, slim young man in traveling
costume.
<P>
"The King's messenger!" Brott exclaimed, rising to his feet.
