<p>There was one wild burst of laughter over the whole face of the world.
</p><p>True, the capture of Arsène Lupin made a big sensation; and the public
did not grudge the police the praise which they deserved for this
revenge so long hoped-for and now so fully obtained. The great
adventurer was caught. That extraordinary, genial, invisible hero was
shivering, like any ordinary criminal, between the four walls of a
prison cell, crushed in his turn by that formidable power which is
called the law and which, sooner or later, by inevitable necessity
shatters the obstacles opposed to it and destroys the work of its
adversaries.
</p><p>All this was said, printed, repeated and discussed <u>ad nauseam</u>. The
prefect of police was created a commander, M. Weber an officer of the
Legion of Honor. The skill and courage of their humblest coadjutors were
extolled to the skies. Cheers were raised and pæans of victory struck
up. Articles were written and speeches made.
</p><p>Very well. But one thing, nevertheless, rose above the wonderful concert
of praise, these noisy demonstrations of satisfaction; and that was an
immense, spontaneous, inextinguishable and tumultuous roar of laughter.
</p><p>Arsène Lupin had been chief of the detective-service for four years!!!
</p><p>He had been chief detective for four years and, really, legally, he was
chief detective still, with all the rights which the title confers,
enjoying the esteem of his chiefs, the favor of the government and the
admiration of the public.
</p><p>For four years, the public peace and the defence of property had been
entrusted to Arsène Lupin. He saw that the law was carried out. He
protected the innocent and pursued the guilty.
</p><p>And what services he had rendered! Never was order less disturbed, never
was crime discovered with greater certainty and rapidity. The reader
need but take back his mind to the Denizou case, the robbery at the
Crédit Lyonnais, the attack on the Orléans express, the murder of Baron
Dorf, forming a series of unforeseen and overwhelming triumphs, of
magnificent feats of prowess fit to compare with the most famous
victories of the most renowned detectives.[6]
</p><p>[Footnote 6: The murder of Baron Dorf, that mysterious and disconcerting
affair, will one day be the subject of a story which will give an idea
of Arsène Lupin's astonishing qualities as a detective.]
</p><p>Not so very long before, in a speech delivered at the time of the fire
at the Louvre and the capture of the incendiaries, Valenglay, the prime
minister, had said, speaking in defence of the somewhat arbitrary manner
in which M. Lenormand had acted on that occasion:
</p><p>"With his great powers of discernment, his energy, his qualities of
decision and execution, his unexpected methods, his inexhaustible
resources, M. Lenormand reminds us of the only man who, if he were still
alive, could hope to hold his own against him: I mean Arsène Lupin. M.
Lenormand is an Arsène Lupin in the service of society."
</p><p>And, lo and behold, M. Lenormand was none other than Arsène Lupin!
</p><p>That he was a Russian prince, who cared! Lupin was an old hand at such
changes of personality as that. But chief detective! What a delicious
irony! What a whimsical humor in the conduct of that extraordinary life!
</p><p>M. Lenormand! . . . Arsène Lupin! . . .
</p><p>People were now able to explain to themselves the apparently miraculous
feats of intelligence which had quite recently bewildered the crowd and
baffled the police. They understood how his accomplice had been juggled
away in the middle of the Palais de Justice itself, in broad daylight
and on the appointed day. Had he himself not said:
</p><p>"My process is so ingenious and so simple. . . . How surprised people
will be on the day when I am free to speak! 'Is that all?' I shall be
asked. That is all; but it had to be thought of."
</p><p>It was, indeed, childishly simple: all you had to do was to be chief of
the detective-service.
</p><p>Well, Lupin was chief of the detective-service; and every police-officer
obeying his orders had made himself the involuntary and unconscious
accomplice of Arsène Lupin.
</p><p>What a comedy! What admirable bluff! It was the monumental and consoling
farce of these drab times of ours. Lupin in prison, Lupin irretrievably
conquered was, in spite of himself, the great conqueror. From his cell
he shone over Paris. He was more than ever the idol, more than ever the
master.
</p><hr/>
<p>When Arsène Lupin awoke next morning, in his room at the "Santé Palace,"
as he at once nicknamed it, he had a very clear vision of the enormous
sensation which would be produced by his arrest under the double name of
Sernine and Lenormand and the double title of prince and chief of the
detective-service.
</p><p>He rubbed his hands and gave vent to his thoughts:
</p><p>"A man can have no better companion in his loneliness than the approval
of his contemporaries. O fame! The sun of all living men! . . ."
</p><p>Seen by daylight, his cell pleased him even better than at night. The
window, placed high up in the wall, afforded a glimpse of the branches
of a tree, through which peeped the blue of the sky above. The walls
were white. There was only one table and one chair, both fastened to the
floor. But everything was quite nice and clean.
</p><p>"Come," he said, "a little rest-cure here will be rather charming. . . .
But let us see to our toilet. . . . Have I all I want? . . . No. . . .
In that case, ring twice for the chambermaid."
</p><p>He pressed the button of an apparatus beside the door, which released a
signaling-disc in the corridor.
</p><p>After a moment, bolts and bars were drawn outside, a key turned in the
lock and a warder appeared.
</p><p>"Hot water, please," said Lupin.
</p><p>The other looked at him with an air of mingled amazement and rage.
</p><p>"Oh," said Lupin, "and a bath-towel! By Jove, there's no bath-towel!"
</p><p>The man growled:
</p><p>"You're getting at me, aren't you? You'd better be careful!"
</p><p>He was going away, when Lupin caught him roughly by the arm:
</p><p>"Here! A hundred francs if you'll post a letter for me."
</p><p>He took out a hundred-franc note, which he had concealed during the
search, and offered it to him.
</p><p>"Where's the letter?" said the warder, taking the money.
</p><p>"Just give me a moment to write it."
</p><p>He sat down at the table, scribbled a few words in pencil on a sheet of
paper, put it in an envelope and addressed the letter:
</p><pre>
      _"To Monsieur S. B. 42,_
               _"Poste Restante,_
                         "PARIS."</pre>
<p>The warder took the letter and walked away.
</p><p>"That letter," said Lupin to himself, "will reach destination as safely
as if I delivered it myself. I shall have the reply in an hour at
latest: just the time I want to take a good look into my position."
</p><p>He sat down on his chair and, in an undertone, summed up the situation
as follows:
</p><p>"When all is said and done, I have two adversaries to fight at the
present moment. There is, first, society, which holds me and which I can
afford to laugh at. Secondly, there is a person unknown, who does not
hold me, but whom I am not inclined to laugh at in the very least. It is
he who told the police that I was Sernine. It was he who guessed that I
was M. Lenormand. It was he who locked the door of the underground
passage and it was he who had me clapped into prison."
</p><p>Arsène Lupin reflected for a second and then continued:
</p><p>"So, at long last, the struggle lies between him and me. And, to keep up
that struggle, that is to say, to discover and get to the bottom of the
Kesselbach case, here am I, a prisoner, while he is free, unknown, and
inaccessible, and holds the two trump-cards which I considered mine:
Pierre Leduc and old Steinweg. . . . In short, he is near the goal,
after finally pushing me back."
</p><p>A fresh contemplative pause, followed by a fresh soliloquy:
</p><p>"The position is far from brilliant. On the one side, everything; on the
other, nothing. Opposite me, a man of my own strength, or stronger,
because he has not the same scruples that hamper me. And I am without
weapons to attack him with."
</p><p>He repeated the last sentence several times, in a mechanical voice, and
then stopped and, taking his forehead between his hands, sat for a long
time wrapped in thought.
</p><p>"Come in, Mr. Governor," he said, seeing the door open.
</p><p>"Were you expecting me?"
</p><p>"Why, I wrote to you, Mr. Governor, asking you to come! I felt certain
that the warder would give you my letter. I was so certain of it that I
put your initials, S. B., and your age, forty-two, on the envelope!"
</p><p>The governor's name, in point of fact, was Stanislas Borély, and he was
forty-two years of age. He was a pleasant-looking man, with a very
gentle character, who treated the prisoners with all the indulgence
possible.
</p><p>He said to Lupin:
</p><p>"Your opinion of my subordinate's integrity was quite correct. Here is
your money. It shall be handed to you at your release. . . . You will
now go through the searching-room again."
</p><p>Lupin went with M. Borély to the little room reserved for this purpose,
undressed and, while his clothes were inspected with justifiable
suspicion, himself underwent a most fastidious examination.
</p><p>He was then taken back to his cell and M. Borély said:
</p><p>"I feel easier. That's done."
</p><p>"And very well done, Mr. Governor. Your men perform this sort of duty
with a delicacy for which I should like to thank them by giving them a
small token of my satisfaction."
</p><p>He handed a hundred-franc note to M. Borély, who jumped as though he had
been shot:
</p><p>"Oh! . . . But . . . where does that come from?"
</p><p>"No need to rack your brains, Mr. Governor. A man like myself, leading
the life that I do, is always prepared for any eventuality: and no
mishap, however painful--not even imprisonment--can take him unawares."
</p><p>Seizing the middle finger of his left hand between the thumb and
forefinger of the right, he pulled it off smartly and presented it
calmly to M. Borély:
</p><p>"Don't start like that, Mr. Governor. This is not my finger, but just a
tube, made of gold-beater's skin and cleverly colored, which fits
exactly over my middle finger and gives the illusion of a real finger."
And he added, with a laugh, "In such a way, of course, as to conceal a
third hundred-franc note. . . . What is a poor man to do? He must carry
the best purse he can . . . and must needs make use of it on occasions.
. . ."
</p><p>He stopped at the sight of M. Borély's startled face:
</p><p>"Please don't think, Mr. Governor, that I wish to dazzle you with my
little parlor-tricks. I only wanted to show you that you have to do with
a . . . client of a rather . . . special nature and to tell you that you
must not be surprised if I venture, now and again, to break the ordinary
rules and regulations of your establishment."
</p><p>The governor had recovered himself. He said plainly:
</p><p>"I prefer to think that you will conform to the rules and not compel me
to resort to harsh measures. . . ."
</p><p>"Which you would regret to have to enforce: isn't that it, Mr. Governor?
That's just what I should like to spare you, by proving to you in
advance that they would not prevent me from doing as I please: from
corresponding with my friends, from defending the grave interests
confided to me outside these walls, from writing to the newspapers that
accept my inspiration, from pursuing the fulfilment of my plans and,
lastly, from preparing my escape."
</p><p>"Your escape!"
</p><p>Lupin began to laugh heartily:
</p><p>"But think, Mr. Governor, my only excuse for being in prison is . . . to
leave it!"
</p><p>The argument did not appear to satisfy M. Borély. He made an effort to
laugh in his turn:
</p><p>"Forewarned is forearmed," he said.
</p><p>"That's what I wanted," Lupin replied. "Take all your precautions, Mr.
Governor, neglect nothing, so that later they may have nothing to
reproach you with. On the other hand, I shall arrange things in such a
way that, whatever annoyance you may have to bear in consequence of my
escape, your career, at least, shall not suffer. That is all I had to
say to you, Mr. Governor. You can go."
</p><p>And, while M. Borély walked away, greatly perturbed by his singular
charge and very anxious about the events in preparation, the prisoner
threw himself on his bed, muttering:
</p><p>"What cheek, Lupin, old fellow, what cheek! Really, any one would think
that you had some idea as to how you were going to get out of this!"
</p><hr/>
<p>The Santé prison is built on the star plan. In the centre of the main
portion is a round hall, upon which all the corridors converge, so that
no prisoner is able to leave his cell without being at once perceived by
the overseers posted in the glass box which occupies the middle of that
central hall.
</p><p>The thing that most surprises the visitor who goes over the prison is
that, at every moment, he will meet prisoners without a guard of any
kind, who seem to move about as though they were absolutely free. In
reality, in order to go from one point to another--for instance, from
their cell to the van waiting in the yard to take them to the Palais de
Justice for the magistrate's examination--they pass along straight lines
each of which ends in a door that is opened to them by a warder. The
sole duty of the warder is to open and shut this door and to watch the
two straight lines which it commands. And thus the prisoners, while
apparently at liberty to come and go as they please, are sent from door
to door, from eye to eye, like so many parcels passed from hand to hand.
</p><p>Outside, municipal guards receive the object and pack it into one of
the compartments of the "salad-basket."[7]
</p><p>[Footnote 7: The French slang expression for its prison-van or "black
Maria."--<u>Translator's Note.</u>]
</p><p>This is the ordinary routine.
</p><p>In Lupin's case it was disregarded entirely. The police were afraid of
that walk along the corridors. They were afraid of the prison-van. They
were afraid of everything.
</p><p>M. Weber came in person, accompanied by twelve constables--the best he
had, picked men, armed to the teeth--fetched the formidable prisoner at
the door of his cell and took him in a cab, the driver of which was one
of his own men, with mounted municipal guards trotting on each side, in
front and behind.
</p><p>"Bravo!" cried Lupin. "I am quite touched by the compliment paid me. A
guard of honor. By Jove, Weber, you have the proper hierarchical
instinct! You don't forget what is due to your immediate chief." And,
tapping him on the shoulder: "Weber, I intend to send in my resignation.
I shall name you as my successor."
</p><p>"It's almost done," said Weber.
</p><p>"That's good news! I was a little anxious about my escape. Now I am easy
in my mind. From the moment when Weber is chief of the detective-service
. . . !"
</p><p>M. Weber did not reply to the gibe. At heart, he had a queer, complex
feeling in the presence of his adversary, a feeling made up of the fear
with which Lupin inspired him, the deference which he entertained for
Prince Sernine and the respectful admiration which he had always shown
to M. Lenormand. All this was mingled with spite, envy and satisfied
hatred.
</p><p>They arrived at the Palais de Justice. At the foot of the "mouse-trap,"
a number of detectives were waiting, among whom M. Weber rejoiced to see
his best two lieutenants, the brothers Doudeville.
</p><p>"Has M. Formerie come?" he asked.
</p><p>"Yes, chief, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction is in his room."
</p><p>M. Weber went up the stairs, followed by Lupin, who had the Doudevilles
on either side of him.
</p><p>"Geneviève?" whispered the prisoner.
</p><p>"Saved. . . ."
</p><p>"Where is she?"
</p><p>"With her grandmother."
</p><p>"Mrs. Kesselbach?"
</p><p>"In Paris, at the Bristol."
</p><p>"Suzanne?"
</p><p>"Disappeared."
</p><p>"Steinweg?"
</p><p>"Released."
</p><p>"What has he told you?"
</p><p>"Nothing. Won't make any revelations except to you."
</p><p>"Why?"
</p><p>"We told him he owed his release to you."
</p><p>"Newspapers good this morning?"
</p><p>"Excellent."
</p><p>"Good. If you want to write to me, here are my instructions."
</p><p>They had reached the inner corridor on the first floor and Lupin slipped
a pellet of paper into the hand of one of the brothers.
</p><hr/>
<p>M. Formerie uttered a delicious phrase when Lupin entered his room
accompanied by the deputy-chief:
</p><p>"Ah, there you are! I knew we should lay hands on you some day or
other!"
</p><p>"So did I, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction," said Lupin, "and I am glad
that you have been marked out by fate to do justice to the honest man
that I am."
</p><p>"He's getting at me," thought M. Formerie. And, in the same ironical and
serious tone as Lupin, he retorted, "The honest man that you are, sir,
will be asked what he has to say about three hundred and forty-four
separate cases of larceny, burglary, swindling and forgery, blackmail,
receiving and so on. Three hundred and forty-four!"
</p><p>"What! Is that all?" cried Lupin. "I really feel quite ashamed."
</p><p>"Don't distress yourself! I shall discover more. But let us proceed in
order. Arsène Lupin, in spite of all our inquiries, we have no definite
information as to your real name."
</p><p>"How odd! No more have I!"
</p><p>"We are not even in a position to declare that you are the same Arsène
Lupin who was confined in the Santé a few years back, and from there
made his first escape."
</p><p>"'His first escape' is good, and does you credit."
</p><p>"It so happens, in fact," continued M. Formerie, "that the Arsène Lupin
card in the measuring department gives a description of Arsène Lupin
which differs at all points from your real description."
</p><p>"How more and more odd!"
</p><p>"Different marks, different measurements, different finger-prints. . . .
The two photographs even are quite unlike. I will therefore ask you to
satisfy us as to your exact identity."
</p><p>"That's just what I was going to ask you. I have lived under so many
distinct names that I have ended by forgetting my own. I don't know
where I am."
</p><p>"So I must enter a refusal to answer?"
</p><p>"An inability."
</p><p>"Is this a thought-out plan? Am I to expect the same silence in reply to
all my questions?"
</p><p>"Very nearly."
</p><p>"And why?"
</p><p>Lupin struck a solemn attitude and said:
</p><p>"M. le Juge d'Instruction, my life belongs to history. You have only to
turn over the annals of the past fifteen years and your curiosity will
be satisfied. So much for my part. As to the rest, it does not concern
me: it is an affair between you and the murderers at the Palace Hotel."
</p><p>"Arsène Lupin, the honest man that you are will have to-day to explain
the murder of Master Altenheim."
</p><p>"Hullo, this is new! Is the idea yours, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction?"
</p><p>"Exactly."
</p><p>"Very clever! Upon my word, M. Formerie, you're getting on!"
</p><p>"The position in which you were captured leaves no doubt."
</p><p>"None at all; only, I will venture to ask you this: what sort of wound
did Altenheim die of?"
</p><p>"Of a wound in the throat caused by a knife."
</p><p>"And where is the knife?"
</p><p>"It has not been found."
</p><p>"How could it not have been found, if I had been the assassin,
considering that I was captured beside the very man whom I am supposed
to have killed?"
</p><p>"Who killed him, according to you?"
</p><p>"The same man that killed Mr. Kesselbach, Chapman, and Beudot. The
nature of the wound is a sufficient proof."
</p><p>"How did he get away?"
</p><p>"Through a trap-door, which you will discover in the room where the
tragedy took place."
</p><p>M. Formerie assumed an air of slyness:
</p><p>"And how was it that you did not follow that useful example?"
</p><p>"I tried to follow it. But the outlet was blocked by a door which I
could not open. It was during this attempt that 'the other one' came
back to the room and killed his accomplice for fear of the revelations
which he would have been sure to make. At the same time, he hid in a
cupboard, where it was subsequently found, the parcel of clothes which I
had prepared."
</p><p>"What were those clothes for?"
</p><p>"To disguise myself. When I went to the Glycines my plan was this: to
hand Altenheim over to the police, to suppress my own identity as Prince
Sernine and to reappear under the features. . . ."
</p><p>"Of M. Lenormand, I suppose?"
</p><p>"Exactly."
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"What!"
</p><p>M. Formerie gave a knowing smile and wagged his forefinger from left to
right and right to left:
</p><p>"No," he repeated.
</p><p>"What do you mean by 'no'?"
</p><p>"That story about M. Lenormand. . . ."
</p><p>"Well?"
</p><p>"Will do for the public, my friend. But you won't make M. Formerie
swallow that Lupin and Lenormand were one and the same man." He burst
out laughing. "Lupin, chief of the detective-service! No, anything you
like, but not that! . . . There are limits. . . . I am an easy-going
fellow. . . . I'll believe anything . . . but still. . . . Come, between
ourselves, what was the reason of this fresh hoax? . . . I confess I
can't see . . ."
</p><p>Lupin looked at him in astonishment. In spite of all that he knew of M.
Formerie, he could not conceive such a degree of infatuation and
blindness. There was at that moment only one person in the world who
refused to believe in Prince Sernine's double personality; and that was
M. Formerie! . . .
</p><p>Lupin turned to the deputy-chief, who stood listening open-mouthed:
</p><p>"My dear Weber, I fear your promotion is not so certain as I thought.
For, you see, if M. Lenormand is not myself, then he exists . . . and,
if he exists, I have no doubt that M. Formerie, with all his acumen,
will end by discovering him . . . in which case . . ."
</p><p>"We shall discover him all right, M. Lupin," cried the
examining-magistrate. "I'll undertake that, and I tell you that, when
you and he are confronted, we shall see some fun." He chuckled and
drummed with his fingers on the table. "How amusing! Oh, one's never
bored when you're there, that I'll say for you! So you're M. Lenormand,
and it's you who arrested your accomplice Marco!"
</p><p>"Just so! Wasn't it my duty to please the prime minister and save the
cabinet? The fact is historical."
</p><p>M. Formerie held his sides:
</p><p>"Oh, I shall die of laughing, I know I shall! Lord, what a joke! That
answer will travel round the world. So, according to your theory, it was
with you that I made the first enquiries at the Palace Hotel after the
murder of Mr. Kesselbach? . . ."
</p><p>"Surely it was with me that you investigated the case of the stolen
coronet when I was Duc de Chamerace,"[8] retorted Lupin, in a sarcastic
voice.
</p><p>[Footnote 8: See <u>Arsène Lupin</u> by Edgar Jepson and Maurice Leblanc.]
</p><p>M. Formerie gave a start. All his merriment was dispelled by that odious
recollection. Turning suddenly grave, he asked:
</p><p>"So you persist in that absurd theory?"
</p><p>"I must, because it is the truth. It would be easy for you to take a
steamer to Cochin-China and to find at Saigon the proofs of the death of
the real M. Lenormand, the worthy man whom I replaced and whose
death-certificate I can show you."
</p><p>"Humbug!"
</p><p>"Upon my word, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, I don't care one way or
the other. If it annoys you that I should be M. Lenormand, don't let's
talk about it. We won't talk about myself; we won't talk about anything
at all, if you prefer. Besides, of what use can it be to you? The
Kesselbach case is such a tangled affair that I myself don't know where
I stand. There's only one man who might help you. I have not succeeded
in discovering him. And I don't think that you . . ."
</p><p>"What's the man's name?"
</p><p>"He's an old man, a German called Steinweg. . . . But, of course, you've
heard about him, Weber, and the way in which he was carried off in the
middle of the Palais de Justice?"
</p><p>M. Formerie threw an inquiring glance at the deputy-chief. M. Weber
said:
</p><p>"I undertake to bring that person to you, Monsieur le Juge
d'Instruction."
</p><p>"So that's done," said M. Formerie, rising from his chair. "As you see,
Lupin, this was merely a formal examination to bring the two duelists
together. Now that we have crossed swords, all that we need is the
necessary witness of our fencing-match, your counsel."
</p><p>"Tut! Is it indispensable?"
</p><p>"Indispensable."
</p><p>"Employ counsel in view of such an unlikely trial?"
</p><p>"You must."
</p><p>"In that case, I'll choose Maître Quimbel."
</p><p>"The president of the corporation of the bar. You are wise, you will be
well defended."
</p><hr/>
<p>The first sitting was over. M. Weber led the prisoner away.
</p><p>As he went down the stairs of the "mouse-trap," between the two
Doudevilles, Lupin said, in short, imperative sentences:
</p><p>"Watch Steinweg. . . . Don't let him speak to anybody. . . . Be there
to-morrow. . . . I'll give you some letters . . . one for you . . .
important."
</p><p>Downstairs, he walked up to the municipal guards surrounding the
taxi-cab:
</p><p>"Home, boys," he exclaimed, "and quick about it! I have an appointment
with myself for two o'clock precisely."
</p><p>There were no incidents during the drive. On returning to his cell,
Lupin wrote a long letter, full of detailed instructions, to the
brothers Doudeville and, two other letters.
</p><p>One was for Geneviève:
</p><pre>
      "Geneviève, you now know who I am and you will
      understand why I concealed from you the name of him
      who twice carried you away in his arms when you were a
      little girl.
      "Geneviève, I was your mother's friend, a distant
      friend, of whose double life she knew nothing, but
      upon whom she thought that she could rely. And that is
      why, before dying, she wrote me a few lines asking me
      to watch over you.
      "Unworthy as I am of your esteem, Geneviève, I shall
      continue faithful to that trust. Do not drive me from
      your heart entirely.
                                   "ARSÈNE LUPIN."</pre>
<p>The other letter was addressed to Dolores Kesselbach:
</p><pre>
      "Prince Sernine was led to seek Mrs. Kesselbach's
      acquaintance by motives of self-interest alone. But a
      great longing to devote himself to her was the cause
      of his continuing it.
      "Now that Prince Sernine has become merely Arsène
      Lupin, he begs Mrs. Kesselbach not to deprive him of
      the right of protecting her, at a distance and as a
      man protects one whom he will never see again."</pre>
<p>There were some envelopes on the table. He took up one and took up a
second; then, when he took up the third, he noticed a sheet of white
paper, the presence of which surprised him and which had words stuck
upon it, evidently cut out of a newspaper. He read:
</p><pre>
      "You have failed in your fight with the baron. Give up
      interesting yourself in the case, and I will not
      oppose your escape.
                                           "L. M."</pre>
<p>Once more, Lupin had that sense of repulsion and terror with which this
nameless and fabulous being always inspired him, a sense of disgust
which one feels at touching a venomous animal, a reptile:
</p><p>"He again," he said. "Even here!"
</p><p>That also scared him, the sudden vision which he at times received of
this hostile power, a power as great as his own and disposing of
formidable means, the extent of which he himself was unable to realize.
</p><p>He at once suspected his warder. But how had it been possible to corrupt
that hard-featured, stern-eyed man?
</p><p>"Well, so much the better, after all!" he cried. "I have never had to do
except with dullards. . . . In order to fight myself, I had to chuck
myself into the command of the detective-service. . . . This time, I
have some one to deal with! . . . Here's a man who puts me in his pocket
. . . by sleight of hand, one might say. . . . If I succeed, from my
prison cell, in avoiding his blows and smashing him, in seeing old
Steinweg and dragging his confession from him, in setting the Kesselbach
case on its legs and turning the whole of it into cash, in defending
Mrs. Kesselbach and winning fortune and happiness for Geneviève . . .
well, then Lupin will be Lupin still! . . ."
</p><p>Eleven days passed. On the twelfth day, Lupin woke very early and
exclaimed:
</p><p>"Let me see, if my calculations are correct and if the gods are on my
side, there will be some news to-day. I have had four interviews with
Formerie. The fellow must be worked up to the right point now. And the
Doudevilles, on their side, must have been busy. . . . We shall have
some fun!"
</p><p>He flung out his fists to right and left, brought them back to his
chest, then flung them out again and brought them back again.
</p><p>This movement, which executed thirty times in succession, was followed
by a bending of his body backwards and forwards. Next came an alternate
lifting of the legs and then an alternate swinging of the arms.
</p><p>The whole performance occupied a quarter of an hour, the quarter of an
hour which he devoted every morning to Swedish exercises to keep his
muscles in condition.
</p><p>Then he sat down to his table, took up some sheets of white paper, which
were arranged in numbered packets, and, folding one of them, made it
into an envelope, a work which he continued to do with a series of
successive sheets. It was the task which he had accepted and which he
forced himself to do daily, the prisoners having the right to choose the
labor which they preferred: sticking envelopes, making paper fans, metal
purses, and so on. . . .
</p><p>And, in this way, while occupying his hands with an automatic exercise
and keeping his muscles supple with mechanical bendings, Lupin was able
to have his thoughts constantly fixed on his affairs. . . .
</p><p>And his affairs were complicated enough, in all conscience!
</p><p>There was one, for instance, which surpassed all the others in
importance, and for which he had to employ all the resources of his
genius. How was he to have a long, quiet conversation with old Steinweg?
The necessity was immediate. In a few days, Steinweg would have
recovered from his imprisonment, would receive interviews, might blab
. . . to say nothing of the inevitable interference of the enemy, 'the
other one.' And it was essential that Steinweg's secret, Pierre Leduc's
secret, should be revealed to no one but Lupin. Once published, the
secret lost all its value. . . .
</p><p>The bolts grated, the key turned noisily in the lock.
</p><p>"Ah, it's you, most excellent of jailers! Has the moment come for the
last toilet? The hair-cut that precedes the great final cut of all?"
</p><p>"Magistrate's examination," said the man, laconically.
</p><p>Lupin walked through the corridors of the prison and was received by the
municipal guards, who locked him into the prison-van.
</p><p>He reached the Palais de Justice twenty minutes later. One of the
Doudevilles was waiting near the stairs. As they went up, he said to
Lupin:
</p><p>"You'll be confronted to-day."
</p><p>"Everything settled?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Weber?"
</p><p>"Busy elsewhere."
</p><p>Lupin walked into M. Formerie's room and at once recognized old
Steinweg, sitting on a chair, looking ill and wretched. A municipal
guard was standing behind him.
</p><p>M. Formerie scrutinized the prisoner attentively, as though he hoped to
draw important conclusions from his contemplation of him, and said:
</p><p>"You know who this gentleman is?"
</p><p>"Why, Steinweg, of course! . . ."
</p><p>"Yes, thanks to the active inquiries of M. Weber and of his two
officers, the brothers Doudeville, we have found Mr. Steinweg, who,
according to you, knows the ins and outs of the Kesselbach case, the
name of the murderer and all the rest of it."
</p><p>"I congratulate you, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction. Your examination
will go swimmingly."
</p><p>"I think so. There is only one 'but': Mr. Steinweg refuses to reveal
anything, except in your presence."
</p><p>"Well, I never! How odd of him! Does Arsène Lupin inspire him with so
much affection and esteem?"
</p><p>"Not Arsène Lupin, but Prince Sernine, who, he says, saved his life, and
M. Lenormand, with whom, he says, he began a conversation. . . ."
</p><p>"At the time when I was chief of the detective-service," Lupin broke in.
"So you consent to admit."
</p><p>"Mr. Steinweg," said the magistrate, "do you recognize M. Lenormand?"
</p><p>"No, but I know that Arsène Lupin and he are one."
</p><p>"So you consent to speak?"
</p><p>"Yes . . . but . . . we are not alone."
</p><p>"How do you mean? There is only my clerk here . . . and the guard . . ."
</p><p>"Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, the secret which I am about to reveal
is so important that you yourself would be sorry . . ."
</p><p>"Guard, go outside, please," said M. Formerie. "Come back at once, if I
call. Do you object to my clerk, Steinweg?"
</p><p>"No, no . . . it might be better . . . but, however . . ."
</p><p>"Then speak. For that matter, nothing that you reveal will be put down
in black on white. One word more, though: I ask you for the last time,
is it indispensable that the prisoner should be present at this
interview?"
</p><p>"Quite indispensable. You will see the reason for yourself."
</p><p>He drew the chair up to the magistrate's desk, Lupin remained standing,
near the clerk. And the old man, speaking in a loud voice, said:
</p><p>"It is now ten years since a series of circumstances, which I need not
enter into, made me acquainted with an extraordinary story in which two
persons are concerned."
</p><p>"Their names, please."
</p><p>"I will give the names presently. For the moment, let me say that one of
these persons occupies an exceptional position in France, and that the
other, an Italian, or rather a Spaniard . . . yes, a Spaniard . . ."
</p><p>A bound across the room, followed by two formidable blows of the fist.
. . . Lupin's two arms had darted out to right and left, as though
impelled by springs and his two fists, hard as cannon balls, caught the
magistrate and his clerk on the jaw, just below the ear.
</p><p>The magistrate and the clerk collapsed over their tables, in two lumps,
without a moan.
</p><p>"Well hit!" said Lupin. "That was a neat bit of work."
</p><p>He went to the door and locked it softly. Then returning:
</p><p>"Steinweg, have you the chloroform?"
</p><p>"Are you quite sure that they have fainted?" asks the old man, trembling
with fear.
</p><p>"What do you think! But it will only last for three or four minutes.
. . . And that is not long enough."
</p><p>The German produced from his pocket a bottle and two pads of
cotton-wool, ready prepared.
</p><p>Lupin uncorked the bottle, poured a few drops of the chloroform on the
two pads and held them to the noses of the magistrate and his clerk.
</p><p>"Capital! We have ten minutes of peace and quiet before us. That will
do, but let's make haste, all the same; and not a word too much, old
man, do you hear?" He took him by the arm. "You see what I am able to
do. Here we are, alone in the very heart of the Palais de Justice,
because I wished it."
</p><p>"Yes," said the old man.
</p><p>"So you are going to tell me your secret?"
</p><p>"Yes, I told it to Kesselbach, because he was rich and could turn it to
better account than anybody I knew; but, prisoner and absolutely
powerless though you are, I consider you a hundred times as strong as
Kesselbach with his hundred millions."
</p><p>"In that case, speak; and let us take things in their proper order. The
name of the murderer?"
</p><p>"That's impossible."
</p><p>"How do you mean, impossible? I thought you knew it and were going to
tell me everything!"
</p><p>"Everything, but not that."
</p><p>"But . . ."
</p><p>"Later on."
</p><p>"You're mad! Why?"
</p><p>"I have no proofs. Later, when you are free, we will hunt together.
Besides, what's the good? And then, really, I can't tell you."
</p><p>"You're afraid of him?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Very well," said Lupin. "After all, that's not the most urgent matter.
As to the rest, you've made up your mind to speak?"
</p><p>"Without reserve."
</p><p>"Well, then, answer. Who is Pierre Leduc?"
</p><p>"Hermann IV., Grand Duke of Zweibrucken-Veldenz, Prince of Berncastel,
Count of Fistingen, Lord of Wiesbaden and other places."
</p><p>Lupin felt a thrill of joy at learning that his _protégé_ was definitely
not the son of a pork-butcher!
</p><p>"The devil!" he muttered. "So we have a handle to our name! . . . As far
as I remember, the Grand-duchy of Zweibrucken-Veldenz is in Prussia?"
</p><p>"Yes, on the Moselle. The house of Veldenz is a branch of the Palatine
house of Zweibrucken. The grand-duchy was occupied by the French after
the peace of Luneville and formed part of the department of
Mont-Tonnerre. In 1814, it was restored in favor of Hermann I., the
great grandfather of Pierre Leduc. His son, Hermann II., spent a riotous
youth, ruined himself, squandered the finances of his country and made
himself impossible to his subjects, who ended by partly burning the old
castle at Veldenz and driving their sovereign out of his dominions. The
grand-duchy was then administered and governed by three regents, in the
name of Hermann II., who, by a curious anomaly, did not abdicate, but
retained his title as reigning grand-duke. He lived, rather short of
cash, in Berlin; later, he fought in the French war, by the side of
Bismarck, of whom he was a friend. He was killed by a shell at the siege
of Paris and, in dying, entrusted Bismarck with the charge of his son
Hermann, that is, Hermann III."
</p><p>"The father, therefore, of our Leduc," said Lupin.
</p><p>"Yes. The chancellor took a liking to Hermann III., and used often to
employ him as a secret envoy to persons of distinction abroad. At the
fall of his patron Hermann III., left Berlin, travelled about and
returned and settled in Dresden. When Bismarck died, Hermann III., was
there. He himself died two years later. These are public facts, known to
everybody in Germany; and that is the story of the three Hermanns,
Grand-dukes of Zweibrucken-Veldenz in the nineteenth century."
</p><p>"But the fourth, Hermann IV., the one in whom we are interested?"
</p><p>"We will speak of him presently. Let us now pass on to unknown facts."
</p><p>"Facts known to you alone," said Lupin.
</p><p>"To me alone and to a few others."
</p><p>"How do you mean, a few others? Hasn't the secret been kept?"
</p><p>"Yes, yes, the secret has been well kept by all who know it. Have no
fear; it is very much to their interest, I assure you, not to divulge
it."
</p><p>"Then how do you know it?"
</p><p>"Through an old servant and private secretary of the Grand-duke Hermann,
the last of the name. This servant, who died in my arms in South Africa,
began by confiding to me that his master was secretly married and had
left a son behind him. Then he told me the great secret."
</p><p>"The one which you afterwards revealed to Kesselbach."
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"One second . . . Will you excuse me? . . ."
</p><p>Lupin bent over M. Formerie, satisfied himself that all was well and the
heart beating normally, and said:
</p><p>"Go on."
</p><p>Steinweg resumed:
</p><p>"On the evening of the day on which Bismarck died, the Grand-duke
Hermann III. and his faithful manservant--my South African friend--took
a train which brought them to Munich in time to catch the express for
Vienna. From Vienna, they went to Constantinople, then to Cairo, then to
Naples, then to Tunis, then to Spain, then to Paris, then to London, to
St. Petersburg, to Warsaw . . . and in none of these towns did they
stop. They took a cab, had their two bags put on the top, rushed through
the streets, hurried to another station or to the landing-stage, and
once more took the train or the steamer."
</p><p>"In short, they were being followed and were trying to put their
pursuers off the scent," Arsène Lupin concluded.
</p><p>"One evening, they left the city of Treves, dressed in workmen's caps
and linen jackets, each with a bundle slung over his shoulder at the end
of a stick. They covered on foot the twenty-two miles to Veldenz, where
the old Castle of Zweibrucken stands, or rather the ruins of the old
castle."
</p><p>"No descriptions, please."
</p><p>"All day long, they remained hidden in a neighboring forest. At night,
they went up to the old walls. Hermann ordered his servant to wait for
him and himself scaled the wall at a breach known as the Wolf's Gap. He
returned in an hour's time. In the following week, after more
peregrinations, he went back home to Dresden. The expedition was over."
</p><p>"And what was the object of the expedition?"
</p><p>"The grand-duke never breathed a word about it to his servant. But
certain particulars and the coincidence of facts that ensued enabled the
man to build up the truth, at least, in part."
</p><p>"Quick, Steinweg, time is running short now: and I am eager to know."
</p><p>"A fortnight after the expedition, Count von Waldemar, an officer in the
Emperor's body-guard and one of his personal friends, called on the
grand-duke, accompanied by six men. He was there all day, locked up with
the grand-duke in his study. There were repeated sounds of altercations,
of violent disputes. One phrase even was overheard by the servant, who
was passing through the garden, under the windows: 'Those papers were
handed to you; His imperial Majesty is sure of it. If you refuse to give
them to me of your own free will . . .' The rest of the sentence, the
meaning of the threat and, for that matter, the whole scene can be
easily guessed by what followed; Hermann's house was ransacked from top
to bottom."
</p><p>"But that is against the law."
</p><p>"It would have been against the law if the grand-duke had objected; but
he himself accompanied the count in his search."
</p><p>"And what were they looking for? The chancellor's memoirs?"
</p><p>"Something better than that. They were looking for a parcel of secret
documents which were known to exist, owing to indiscretions that had
been committed, and which were known for certain to have been entrusted
to the Grand-duke Hermann's keeping."
</p><p>Lupin muttered, excitedly:
</p><p>"Secret documents . . . and very important ones, no doubt?"
</p><p>"Of the highest importance. The publication of those papers would lead
to results which it would be impossible to foresee, not only from the
point of view of home politics, but also from that of Germany's
relations with the foreign powers."
</p><p>"Oh!" said Lupin, throbbing with emotion. "Oh, can it be possible? What
proof have you?"
</p><p>"What proof? The evidence of the grand-duke's wife, the confidences
which she made to the servant after her husband's death."
</p><p>"Yes . . . yes . . ." stammered Lupin. "We have the evidence of the
grand-duke himself."
</p><p>"Better still," said Steinweg.
</p><p>"What?"
</p><p>"A document, a document written in his own hand, signed by him and
containing . . ."
</p><p>"Containing what?"
</p><p>"A list of the secret papers confided to his charge."
</p><p>"Tell me, in two words. . . ."
</p><p>"In two words? That can't be done. The document is a very long one,
scattered all over with annotations and remarks which are sometimes
impossible to understand. Let me mention just two titles which obviously
refer to two bundles of secret papers: <u>Original letters of the Crown
Prince to Bismarck</u> is one. The dates show that these letters were
written during the three months of the reign of Frederick III. To
picture what the letters may contain, you have only to think of the
Emperor Frederick's illness, his quarrels with his son . . ."
</p><p>"Yes, yes, I know. . . . And the other title?"
</p><p>"<u>Photographs of the letters of Frederick III., and the Empress Victoria
to the Queen of England.</u>"
</p><p>"Do you mean to say that that's there?" asked Lupin, in a choking voice.
</p><p>"Listen to the grand-duke's notes: <u>Text of the treaty with Great
Britain and France.</u> And these rather obscure words: 'Alsace-Lorraine.
. . . Colonies. . . . Limitation of naval armaments. . . ."
</p><p>"It says that?" blurted Lupin. "And you call that obscure? . . . Why,
the words are dazzling with light! . . . Oh, can it be possible? . . .
And what next, what next?"
</p><p>As he spoke there was a noise at the door. Some one was knocking.
</p><p>"You can't come in," said Lupin. "I am busy. . . . Go on, Steinweg."
</p><p>"But . . ." said the old man, in a great state of alarm.
</p><p>The door was shaken violently and Lupin recognized Weber's voice. He
shouted:
</p><p>"A little patience, Weber. I shall have done in five minutes."
</p><p>He gripped the old man's arm and, in a tone of command:
</p><p>"Be easy and go on with your story. So, according to you, the expedition
of the grand duke and his servant to Veldenz Castle had no other object
than to hide those papers?"
</p><p>"There can be no question about that."
</p><p>"Very well. But the grand-duke may have taken them away since."
</p><p>"No, he did not leave Dresden until his death."
</p><p>"But the grand-duke's enemies, the men who had everything to gain by
recovering them and destroying them: can't they have tried to find out
where the papers were?"
</p><p>"They have tried."
</p><p>"How do you know?"
</p><p>"You can understand that I did not remain inactive and that my first
care, after receiving those revelations, was to go to Veldenz and make
inquiries for myself in the neighboring villages. Well, I learnt that,
on two separate occasions, the castle was invaded by a dozen men, who
came from Berlin furnished with credentials to the regents."
</p><p>"Well?"
</p><p>"Well, they found nothing, for, since that time, the castle has been
found closed to the public."
</p><p>"But what prevents anybody from getting in?"
</p><p>"A garrison of fifty soldiers, who keep watch day and night."
</p><p>"Soldiers of the grand-duchy?"
</p><p>"No, soldiers drafted from the Emperor's own body-guard."
</p><p>The din in the passage increased:
</p><p>"Open the door!" a voice cried. "I order you to open the door!"
</p><p>"I can't. Weber, old chap; the lock has stuck. If you take my advice,
you had better cut the door all round the lock."
</p><p>"Open the door!"
</p><p>"And what about the fate of Europe, which we are discussing?"
</p><p>He turned to the old man:
</p><p>"So you were not able to enter the castle?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"But you are persuaded that the papers in question are hidden there?"
</p><p>"Look here, haven't I given you proofs enough? Aren't you convinced?"
</p><p>"Yes, yes," muttered Lupin, "that's where they are hidden . . . there's
no doubt about it . . . that's where they are hidden. . . ."
</p><p>He seemed to see the castle. He seemed to conjure up the mysterious
hiding-place. And the vision of an inexhaustible treasure, the dream of
chests filled with riches and precious stones could not have excited him
more than the idea of those few scraps of paper watched over by the
Kaiser's guards. What a wonderful conquest to embark upon! And how
worthy of his powers! And what a proof of perspicacity and intuition he
had once more given by throwing himself at a venture upon that unknown
track!
</p><p>Outside, the men were "working" at the lock.
</p><p>Lupin asked of old Steinweg:
</p><p>"What did the grand-duke die of?"
</p><p>"An attack of pleurisy, which carried him off in a few days. He hardly
recovered consciousness before the end; and the horrible thing appears
to have been that he was seen to make violent efforts, between his fits
of delirium, to collect his thoughts and utter connected words. From
time to time, he called his wife, looked at her in a desperate way and
vainly moved his lips."
</p><p>"In a word, he spoke?" said Lupin, cutting him short, for the "working"
at the lock was beginning to make him anxious.
</p><p>"No, he did not speak. But, in a comparatively lucid moment, he summoned
up the energy to make some marks on a piece of paper which his wife
gave him."
</p><p>"Well, those marks . . . ?"
</p><p>"They were illegible, for the most part."
</p><p>"For the most part? But the others?" asked Lupin, greedily. "The
others?"
</p><p>"There were, first, three perfectly distinct figures: an 8, a 1, and a
3. . . ."
</p><p>"Yes, 813, I know . . . and next?"
</p><p>"And next, there were some letters . . . several letters, of which all
that can be made out for certain are a group of three followed,
immediately after, by a group of two letters."
</p><p>"'APO ON,' is that it?"
</p><p>"Oh, so you know! . . ."
</p><p>The lock was yielding; almost all the screws had been taken out. Lupin,
suddenly alarmed at the thought of being interrupted, asked:
</p><p>"So that this incomplete word 'APO ON' and the number 813 are the
formulas which the grand-duke bequeathed to his wife and son to enable
them to find the secret papers?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"What became of the grand-duke's wife?"
</p><p>"She died soon after her husband, of grief, one might say."
</p><p>"And was the child looked after by the family?"
</p><p>"What family? The grand-duke had no brothers or sisters. Moreover, he
was only morganatically and secretly married. No, the child was taken
away by Hermann's old man-servant, who brought him up under the name of
Pierre Leduc. He was a bad type of boy, self-willed, capricious and
troublesome. One day, he went off and was never seen again."
</p><p>"Did he know the secret of his birth?"
</p><p>"Yes; and he was shown the sheet of paper on which Hermann III. had
written the letters and figures."
</p><p>"And after that this revelation was made to no one but yourself?"
</p><p>"That's all."
</p><p>"And you confided only in Mr. Kesselbach?"
</p><p>"Yes. But, out of prudence, while showing him the sheet of letters and
figures and the list of which I spoke to you, I kept both those
documents in my own possession. Events have proved that I was right."
</p><p>Lupin was now clinging to the door with both hands:
</p><p>"Weber," he roared, "you're very indiscreet! I shall report you! . . .
Steinweg, have you those documents?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Are they in a safe place?"
</p><p>"Absolutely."
</p><p>"In Paris?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"So much the better. Don't forget that your life is in danger and that
you have people after you."
</p><p>"I know. The least false step and I am done for."
</p><p>"Exactly. So take your precautions, throw the enemy off the scent, go
and fetch your papers and await my instructions. The thing is cut and
dried. In a month, at latest, we will go to Veldenz Castle together."
</p><p>"Suppose I'm in prison?"
</p><p>"I will take you out."
</p><p>"Can you?"
</p><p>"The very day after I come out myself. No, I'm wrong: the same evening
. . . an hour later."
</p><p>"You have the means?"
</p><p>"Since the last ten minutes, an infallible means. You have nothing more
to say to me?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Then I'll open the door."
</p><p>He pulled back the door, and bowing to M. Weber:
</p><p>"My poor old Weber, I don't know what excuse to make . . ."
</p><p>He did not finish his sentence. The sudden inrush of the deputy-chief
and three policeman left him no time.
</p><p>M. Weber was white with rage and indignation. The sight of the two men
lying outstretched quite unsettled him.
</p><p>"Dead!" he exclaimed.
</p><p>"Not a bit of it, not a bit of it," chuckled Lupin, "only asleep!
Formerie was tired out . . . so I allowed him a few moments' rest."
</p><p>"Enough of this humbug!" shouted M. Weber. And, turning to the
policemen, "Take him back to the Santé. And keep your eyes open, damn
it! As for this visitor . . ."
</p><p>Lupin learnt nothing more as to Weber's intentions with regard to old
Steinweg. A crowd of municipal guards and police constables hustled him
down to the prison-van.
</p><p>On the stairs Doudeville whispered:
</p><p>"Weber had a line to warn him. It told him to mind the confrontation and
to be on his guard with Steinweg. The note was signed 'L. M.'"
</p><p>But Lupin hardly bothered his head about all this. What did he care for
the murderer's hatred or old Steinweg's fate? He possessed Rudolf
Kesselbach's secret!
