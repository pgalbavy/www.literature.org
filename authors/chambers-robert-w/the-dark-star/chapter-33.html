<p>The interior of the entire house was now in an uproar; shots
came fast from every landing; the semi-dusk of stair-well and
corridor was lighted by incessant pistol flashes and the whole
building echoed the deafening racket.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" shouted Sengoun furiously, standing
like a baited and perplexed bull. "Who's fighting who in this
fool of a place? By Erlik! I'd like to know whom I'm to fire at!"</p>

<p>Ilse Dumont, creeping along the wall, looked fearfully down at
Weishelm who no longer moved where he lay on the dusty floor,
with eyes and mouth open and his distorted face already half covered
by a wet and crawling scarlet mask.</p>

<p>"Brandes and Stull are betraying us," she whispered. "They are
killing my comrades&mdash;on the stairs down there&#11834;"</p>

<p>"If that is true," called out Neeland in a low, cautious voice,
"you'd better wait a moment, Sengoun!"</p>

<p>But Sengoun's rage for combat had already filled him to overflowing,
and the last rag of patience left him.</p>

<p>"I don't care who is fighting!" he bellowed. "It's all one to
me! Now is the time to shoot our way out of this. Come on, Neeland!
Hurrah for the Terek Cossacks! Another town taken! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>Neeland caught Ilse by the wrist:</p>

<p>"You'd better get free of this house while you can!" he said,
dragging her with him after Sengoun, who had already reached the
head of the stairs and was starting down, peering about for a
target.</p>

<p>Suddenly, on the landing below, Golden Beard and Ali Baba appeared,
caught sight of Sengoun and Neeland above, and opened fire on
them instantly, driving them back from the head of the staircase
flat against the corridor wall. But Golden Beard, seeming to realise
now that the garret landing was held and the way to the roof cut
off, began to retreat from the foot of the garret stairs with
Ali Baba following, their restless, upward-pointed pistols searching
for the slightest movement in the semi-obscurity of the hallway
above.</p>

<p>Sengoun, fuming and fretting, had begun to creep toward the head
of the stairs again, when there came a rattling hail of shots
from below, a rush, the trample of feet, the crash of furniture
and startling slam of a door.</p>

<p>Downstairs straight toward the uproar ran Sengoun with Neeland
beside him. The halls were swimming in acrid fumes; the floors
trembled and shook under the shock as a struggling, fighting knot
of men went tumbling down the stairway below, reached the landing
and burst into the rooms of the Cercle Extranationale.</p>

<p>Leaning over the banisters, Neeland saw Golden Beard turn on
Doc Curfoot, raging, magnificent as a Viking, his blue eyes ablaze.
He hurled his empty pistol at the American; seized chairs, bronzes,
andirons, the clock from the mantel, and sent a storm of heavy
missiles through the doorway among the knot of men who were pressing
him and who had already seized Ali Baba.</p>

<p>Then, from the banisters above, Neeland and Sengoun saw Brandes,
moving stealthily, swiftly, edge his way to a further door.</p>

<p>Steadying the elbow of his pistol hand in the hollow cup of his
left palm, his weapon level, swerving as his quarry moved, he
presently fired at Golden Beard and got him through the back.
And then he shot him again deliberately, through the body, as
the giant turned, made a menacing gesture toward him; took an
uncertain step in his direction; another step, wavering, blindly
grotesque; then stood swaying there under the glare of the partly
shattered chandelier from which hung long shreds of crystal prisms.</p>

<p>And Brandes, aiming once more with methodical and merciless precision,
and taking what time he required to make a bull's-eye on this
great, reeling, golden-crowned bull, fired the third shot at his
magnificent head.</p>

<p>The bronze Barye lion dropped from Golden Beard's nerveless fist;
the towering figure, stiffening, fell over rather slowly and lay
across the velvet carpet as rigid as a great tree.</p>

<p>Brandes went into the room, leaned over the dying man and fired
into his body until his pistol was empty. Then he replaced the
exhausted clip leisurely, leering down at his victim.</p>

<p>There was a horrid sound from the stairs, where Curfoot and another
man were killing a waiter. Strange, sinister faces appeared everywhere
from the smoke-filled club rooms; Stull came out into the hallway
below and shouted up through the stair-well:</p>

<p>"Say, Eddie! For Christ's sake come down here! There's a mob
outside on the street and they're tearing the iron shutters off
the caf√©!"</p>

<p>Curfoot immediately started downstairs; Brandes, pistol in hand,
came slowly out of the club rooms, still leering, his slitted,
greenish eyes almost phosphorescent in the semi-obscurity.</p>

<p>Suddenly he caught sight of Ilse Dumont standing close behind
Sengoun and Neeland on the landing above.</p>

<p>"By God!" he shouted to Curfoot. "Here she is, Doc! Tell your
men! Tell them she's up here on the next floor!"</p>

<p>Sengoun immediately fired at Brandes, who did not return the
shot but went plunging downstairs into the smoky obscurity below.</p>

<p>"Come on!" roared Sengoun to Neeland, starting forward with levelled
weapon. "They've all gone crazy and it's time we were getting
out of this!"</p>

<p>"Quick!" whispered Neeland to Ilse Dumont. "Follow me downstairs!
It's the only chance for you now!"</p>

<p>But the passageway was blocked by a struggling, cursing, panting
crowd, and they were obliged to retreat into the club rooms.</p>

<p>In the <em>salle de jeu</em>, Ali Baba, held fast by three men
dressed as waiters, suddenly tripped up two of them, turned, and
leaped for the doorway. The two men who had been tripped scrambled
to their feet and tore after him. When they reached the hallway
the Eurasian was gone; but all of a sudden there came the crash
of a splintered door from the landing above; and the dim corridor
rang with the frightful screaming of a woman.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;Russian girl!" stammered Ilse Dumont; " &mdash;The
girl I locked in! Oh, my God!&mdash;my God! Karl Breslau is killing
her!"</p>

<p>Neeland sprang into the hall and leaped up the stairs; but the
three men disguised as waiters had arrived before him.</p>

<p>And there, across the threshold of the bedroom, backed up flat
against the shattered door, Ali Baba was already fighting for
his life; and the frightened Russian girl crept out from the bedroom
behind him and ran to Neeland for protection.</p>

<p>Twice Neeland aimed at Ali Baba, but could not bring himself
to fire at the bleeding, rabid object which snarled and slavered
and bit and kicked, regardless of the blows raining on him. At
last one of his assailants broke the half demented creature's
arm with a chair; and the bloody, battered thing squeaked like
a crippled rat and darted away amid the storm of blows descending,
limping and floundering up the attic stairs, his broken arm flapping
with every gasping bound.</p>

<p>After him staggered his sweating and exhausted assailants, reeling
past Neeland and Ilse Dumont and the terrified Russian girl who
crouched behind them. But, halfway up the stairs all three halted
and stood clinging to the banisters as though listening to something
on the floor above them.</p>

<p>Neeland heard it, too: from the roof came a ripping, splintering
sound, as though people on the slates were prying up the bolted
scuttle. The three men on the stairs hesitated a moment longer;
then turned to flee, too late; a hail of pistol shots swept the
attic stairs; all three men came pitching and tumbling down to
the landing.</p>

<p>Two of them lay still; one rose immediately and limped on again
down the hallway, calling over the banisters to those below:</p>

<p>"The Germans on the leads 'ave busted into the garret! Breslau
is up 'ere! Send along those American gunmen, or somebody what
can shoot!"</p>

<p>He was a grey-haired Englishman, smooth shaven and grim; and,
as he stood there at the head of the further stairs, breathing
heavily, awaiting aid from below, he said to Neeland coolly enough:</p>

<p>"You'd better go below, sir. We 'ad our orders to take this Breslau
rat alive, but we can't do it now, and there's like to be a 'orrid
mess 'ere directly."</p>

<p>"Can we get through below?"</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> can," said the man significantly, "but they'll
be detaining one o' them ladies at the door."</p>

<p>"Do you mean me?" said Ilse Dumont.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, I do&#11834;"</p>

<p>She sprang toward the attic stairway, but the British agent whipped
out a pistol and covered her.</p>

<p>"No," he said grimly. "You're wanted below. Go down!"</p>

<p>She came slowly back to where Neeland was standing.</p>

<p>"You'll have to take your chance below," he said under his breath.
"I'll stand by you to the end."</p>

<p>She smiled and continued on toward the stairs where the English
agent stood. Neeland and the Russian girl followed her.</p>

<p>The agent said:</p>

<p>"There's 'ell to pay below, sir."</p>

<p>The depths of the house rang with the infernal din of blows falling
on iron shutters. A deeper, more sinister roar rose from the mob
outside. There was a struggle going on inside the building, too;
Neeland could hear the trampling and surging of men on every floor&mdash;voices
calling from room to room, shouts of anger, the terrible outcry
of a man in agony.</p>

<p>"Wot a rat's nest, then, there was in this here blessed 'ouse,
sir!" said the British agent, coolly. "If we get Breslau and the
others on the roof we've bagged 'em all."</p>

<p>The Russian girl was trembling so violently that Neeland took
her by the arm. But Ilse Dumont, giving her a glance of contempt,
moved calmly past the British agent to the head of the stairway.</p>

<p>"Come," she said to Neeland.</p>

<p>The agent, leaning over the banisters, shouted to a man on the
next floor:</p>

<p>"Look sharp below there! I'm sendin' Miss Dumont down with Mr.
Neeland, the American! Take her in charge, Bill!"</p>

<p>"Send her along!" bawled the man, framing his face with both
hands. "Keep Breslau on the roof a bit and we'll 'ave the beggar
in a few moments!"</p>

<p>Somebody else shouted up from the tumult below:</p>

<p>"It's war, 'Arry! 'Ave you 'eard? It's war this morning! Them
'Uns 'as declared war! And the perlice is a-killin' of the Apaches
all over Paris!"</p>

<p>Ilse Dumont looked curiously at the agent, calmly at Neeland,
then, dropping one hand on the banisters, she went lightly down
the stairs toward the uproar below, followed by Neeland and the
Russian girl clinging to his arm with both desperate little hands.</p>

<p>The British agent hung far over the banisters until he saw his
colleague join them on the floor below; then, reassured, and on
guard again, he leaned back against the corridor wall, his pistol
resting on his thigh, and fixed his cold grey eyes on the attic
stairs once more.</p>

<p>The secret agent who now joined Neeland and Ilse Dumont on the
fourth floor had evidently been constructing a barricade across
the hallway as a precaution in case of a rush from the Germans
on the roof.</p>

<p>Chairs and mattresses, piled shoulder high, obstructed the passageway,
blocking the stairs; and the secret agent&mdash;a very young man with
red hair and in the garb of a waiter&mdash;clambered over it, revolver
in one hand, a pair of handcuffs in the other. He lost his balance
on top of the shaky heap; strove desperately to recover it, scrambled
like a cat in a tub, stumbled, rolled over on a mattress.</p>

<p>And there Neeland pinned him, closing his mouth with one hand
and his throat with the other, while Ilse Dumont tore weapon and
handcuffs from his grasp, snapped the latter over his wrists,
snatched the case from a bedroom pillow lying among the mattresses,
and, with Neeland's aid, swathed the struggling man's head in
it.</p>

<p>"Into that clothes-press!" whispered Ilse, pointing along the
hallway where a door swung open.</p>

<p>"Help me lift him!" motioned Neeland.</p>

<p>Together they got him clear of the shaky barricade and, lugging
him between them, deposited him on the floor of the clothes-press
and locked the door.</p>

<p>So silent had they been that, listening, they heard no movement
from the watcher on the floor above, who stood guard at the attic
stairs. And it was evident he had heard nothing to make him suspicious.</p>

<p>The Russian girl, dreadfully pale, leaned against the wall as
though her limbs scarcely supported her. Neeland passed his arm
under hers, nodded to Ilse Dumont, and started cautiously down
the carpeted stairs, his automatic pistol in one hand, and the
revolver taken from the imprisoned secret agent clutched tightly
in the other.</p>

<p>Down the stairs they crept, straight toward the frightful tumult
still raging below&mdash;down past the wrecked club rooms; past a dead
man sprawling on the landing across the blood-soaked carpet&mdash;down
into the depths of the dusky building toward the lighted caf√©
floor whence came the uproar of excited men, while, from the street
outside, rose the frantic yelling of the mob mingled with the
crash of glass and the clanging dissonance of iron grilles and
shutters which were being battered into fragments.</p>

<p>"It's my chance, now!" whispered Ilse Dumont, slipping past him
like a shadow.</p>

<p>For a moment he saw her silhouetted against the yellow electric
glare on the stairs below, then, half carrying the almost helpless
Russian girl, he stumbled down the last flight of stairs and pushed
his way through a hurrying group of men who seemed to be searching
for something, for they were tearing open cupboards and buffets,
dragging out table drawers and tumbling linen, crockery, and glassware
all over the black and white marble floor.</p>

<p>The whole place was ankle deep in shattered glass and broken
bottles, and the place reeked with smoke and the odour of wine
and spirits.</p>

<p>Neeland forced his way forward into the caf√©, looked around for
Sengoun, and saw him almost immediately.</p>

<p>The young Russian, flushed, infuriated, his collar gone and his
coat in tatters, was struggling with some men who held both his
arms but did not offer to strike him.</p>

<p>Behind him, crowded back into a corner near the cashier's steel-grilled
desk, stood Ilse Dumont, calm, disdainful, confronted by Brandes,
whose swollen, greenish eyes, injected with blood, glared redly
at her. Stull had hold of him and was trying to drag him away:</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Eddie, shut your mouth," he pleaded in English.
"You can't do <em>that</em> to her, whatever she done to you!"</p>

<p>But Brandes, disengaging himself with a jerk, pushed his way
past Sengoun to where Ilse stood.</p>

<p>"I've got the goods on <em>you</em>!" he said in a ferocious
voice that neither Stull nor Curfoot recognised. "You know what
you did to me, don't you! You took my wife from me! Yes, my <em>wife</em>!
She <em>was</em> my wife! She <em>is</em> my wife! &mdash;For
all you did, you lying, treacherous slut! &mdash;For all you've
done to break me, double-cross me, ruin me, drive me out of every
place I went! And now I've got you! I've sold you out! Get that?
And you know what they'll do to you, don't you? Well, you'll see
when&#11834;"</p>

<p>Curfoot and Stull threw themselves against him, but Brandes,
his round face pasty with fury, struggled back again to confront
Ilse Dumont.</p>

<p>"Ruined me!" he repeated. "Took away from me the only thing God
ever gave me for my own! Took my wife!"</p>

<p>"You dog!" said Ilse Dumont very slowly. "You dirty dog!"</p>

<p>A frightful spasm crossed Brandes' features, and Stull snatched
at the pistol he had whipped out. There was a struggle; Brandes
wrenched the weapon free; but Neeland tore his way past Curfoot
and struck Brandes in the face with the butt of his heavy revolver.</p>

<p>Instantly the group parted right and left; Sengoun suddenly twisted
out of the clutches of the men who held him, sprang upon Curfoot,
and jerked the pistol from his fist. At the same moment the entire
front of the caf√© gave way and the mob crashed inward with a roar
amid the deafening din of shattered metal and the clash of splintering
glass.</p>

<p>Through the dust and falling shower of d√©bris, Brandes fired
at Ilse Dumont, reeled about in the whirl of the inrushing throng
engulfing him, still firing blindly at the woman who had been
his wife.</p>

<p>Neeland put a bullet into his pistol arm, and it fell. But Brandes
stretched it out again with a supreme effort, pointing at Ilse
Dumont with jewelled and bloody fingers:</p>

<p>"That woman is a German spy! A spy!" he screamed. "You damn French
mutts, do you understand what I say! Oh, my God! Will someone
who speaks French tell them! Will somebody tell them she's a spy!
<em>La femme! Cette femme!</em>" he shrieked. "<em>Elle est espion!
Esp&#11834;!</em>" He fired again, with his left hand. Then Sengoun
shot him through the head; and at the same moment somebody stabbed
Curfoot in the neck; and the lank American gambler turned and
cried out to Stull in a voice half strangled with pain and fury:</p>

<p>"Look out, Ben. There are apaches in this mob! That one in the
striped jersey knifed me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Tiens, v'la pour toi, sale mec de malheur!</em>" muttered
a voice at his elbow, and a blow from a slung-shot crushed the
base of his skull.</p>

<p>As Curfoot crumpled up, Stull caught him; but the tall gambler's
dead weight bore Stull to his knees among the fierce apaches.</p>

<p>And there, fighting in silence to the end, his chalky face of
a sick clown meeting undaunted the overwhelming odds against him,
Stull was set upon by the apaches and stabbed and stabbed until
his clothing was a heap of ribbons and the watch and packet of
French bank-notes which the assassins tore from his body were
dripping with his blood.</p>

<p>Sengoun and Neeland, their evening clothes in tatters, hatless,
dishevelled, began shooting their way out of the hell of murder
and destruction raging around them.</p>

<p>Behind them crept Ilse Dumont and the Russian girl: dust and
smoke obscured the place where the mob raged from floor to floor
in a frenzy of destruction, tearing out fixtures, telephones,
window-sashes, smashing tables, bar fixtures, mirrors, ripping
the curtains from the windows and the very carpets from the floor
in their overwhelming rage against this German caf√©.</p>

<p>That apaches had entered with them the mob cared nothing; the
red lust of destruction blinded them to everything except their
terrible necessity for the annihilation of this place.</p>

<p>If they saw murder done, and robbery&mdash;if they heard shots in
the tumult and saw pistol flashes through the dust and grey light
of daybreak, they never turned from their raging work.</p>

<p>Out of the frightful turmoil stormed Neeland and Sengoun, their
pistols spitting flame, the two women clinging to their ragged
sleeves. Twice the apaches barred their way with bared knives,
crouching for a rush; but Sengoun fired into them and Neeland's
bullets dropped the ruffian in the striped jersey where he stood
over Stull's twitching body; and the sinister creatures leaped
back from the levelled weapons, turned, and ran.</p>

<p>Through the gaping doorway sprang Sengoun, his empty pistol menacing
the crowd that choked the shadowy street; Neeland flung away his
pistol and turned his revolver on those in the caf√© behind him,
as Ilse Dumont and the Russian girl crept through and out into
the street.</p>

<p>The crowd was cheering and shouting:</p>

<p>"Down with the Germans! To the Brasserie Schwarz!"</p>

<p>An immense wave of people surged suddenly across the rue Vilna,
headed toward the German caf√©s on the Boulevard; and then, for
the first time, Neeland caught sight of policemen standing in
little groups, coolly watching the destruction of the Caf√© des
Bulgars.</p>

<p>Either they were too few to cope with the mob, or they were indifferent
as to what was being done to a German caf√©, but one thing was
plain; the police had not the faintest idea that murder had been
rampant in the place. For, when suddenly a dead body was thrown
from the door out on the sidewalk, their police whistles shrilled
through the street, and they started for the mob, resolutely,
pushing, striking with white-gloved fists, shouting for right
of way.</p>

<p>Other police came running, showing that they had been perfectly
aware that German caf√©s were being attacked and wrecked. A mounted
inspector forced his horse along the swarming sidewalk, crying:</p>

<p>"<em>Allons! Circulez! C'est d√©fendu de s'attrouper dans la rue!
Mais fichez-moi le camp, nom de Dieu! Les Allemands ne sont pas
encore dans la place!</em>"</p>

<p>Along the street and on the Boulevard mobs were forming and already
storming three other German caf√©s; a squadron of Republican Guard
cavalry arrived at a trot, their helmets glittering in the increasing
daylight, driving before them a mob which had begun to attack
a caf√© on the corner.</p>

<p>A captain, superbly mounted, rode ahead of the advancing line
of horses, warning the throng back into the rue Vilna, up which
the mob now recoiled, sullenly protesting.</p>

<p>Neeland and Sengoun and the two women were forced back with the
crowd as a double rank of steel-helmeted horsemen advanced, sweeping
everybody into the rue Vilna.</p>

<p>Up the street, through the vague morning light, they retired
between ranks of closed and silent houses, past narrow, evil-looking
streets and stony alleys still dark with the shadows of the night.</p>

<p>Into one of these Neeland started with Ilse Dumont, but Sengoun
drew him back with a sharp exclamation of warning. At the same
time the crowd all around them became aware of what was going
on in the maze of dusky lanes and alleys past which they were
being driven by the cavalry; and the people broke and scattered
like rabbits, darting through the cavalry, dodging, scuttling
under the very legs of the horses.</p>

<p>The troop, thrown into disorder, tried to check the panic-stricken
flight; a brigadier, spurring forward to learn the cause of the
hysterical stampede, drew bridle sharply, then whipped his pistol
out of the saddle-holster, and galloped into an <em>impasse</em>.</p>

<p>The troop captain, pushing his horse, caught sight of Sengoun
and Neeland in the remains of their evening dress; and he glanced
curiously at them, and at the two young women clad in the rags
of evening gowns.</p>

<p>"<em>Nom de Dieu!</em>" he cried. "What are such people as you
doing here? Go back! This is no quarter for honest folk!"</p>

<p>"What are those police doing in the alleys?" demanded Sengoun;
but the captain cantered his horse up the street, pistol lifted;
and they saw him fire from his saddle at a man who darted out
of an alley and who started to run across the street.</p>

<p>The captain missed every shot, but a trooper, whose horse had
come up on the sidewalk beside Neeland, fired twice more after
the running man, and dropped him at the second shot.</p>

<p>"A good business, too," he said calmly, winking at Neeland. "You
<em>bourgeois</em> ought to be glad that we're ordered to clean
up Paris for you. And now is the time to do it," he added, reloading
his weapon.</p>

<p>Sengoun said in a low voice to Neeland:</p>

<p>"They're ridding the city of apaches. It's plain enough that
they have orders to kill them where they find them! Look!" he
added, pointing to the dead wall across the street; "It's here
at last, and Paris is cleaning house and getting ready for it!
This is war, Neeland&mdash;war at last!"</p>

<p>Neeland looked across the street where, under a gas lamp on a
rusty iron bracket, was pasted the order for general mobilisation.
And on the sidewalk at the base of the wall lay a man, face downward,
his dusty shoes crossed under the wide flaring trousers, the greasy
<em>casquet</em> still crowding out his lop ears; his hand clenched
beside a stiletto which lay on the stone flagging beside him.</p>

<p>"An apache," said Sengoun coolly. "That's right, too. It's the
way we do in Russia when we clean house for war&#11834;"</p>

<p>His face reddened and lighted joyously.</p>

<p>"Thank God for my thousand lances!" he said, lifting his eyes
to the yellowing sky between the houses in the narrow street.
"Thank God! Thank God!"</p>

<p>Now, across the intersections of streets and alleys beyond where
they stood, policemen and Garde cavalry were shooting into doorways,
basements, and up the sombre, dusky lanes, the dry crack of their
service revolvers re-echoing noisily through the street.</p>

<p>Toward the Boulevard below, a line of police and of cavalrymen
blocked the rue Vilna; and, beyond them, the last of the mob was
being driven from the Caf√© des Bulgars, where the first ambulances
were arriving and the police, guarding the ruins, were already
looking out of windows on the upper floors.</p>

<p>A cavalryman came clattering down the rue Vilna, gesticulating
and calling out to Sengoun and Neeland to take their ladies and
depart.</p>

<p>"Get us a taxicab&mdash;there's a good fellow!" cried Sengoun in high
spirits; and the cavalryman, looking at their dishevelled attire,
laughed and nodded as he rode ahead of them down the rue Vilna.</p>

<p>There were several taxicabs on the Boulevard, their drivers staring
up at the wrecked caf√©. As Neeland spoke to the driver of one
of the cabs, Ilse Dumont stepped back beside the silent girl whom
she had locked in the bedroom.</p>

<p>"I gave <em>you</em> a chance," she said under her breath. "What
may I expect from you? Answer me quickly! &mdash;What am I to
expect?"</p>

<p>The girl seemed dazed:</p>

<p>"N-nothing," she stammered. "The&mdash;the horror of that place&mdash;the
killing&mdash;has sickened me. I &mdash;I want to go home&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You do not intend to denounce me?"</p>

<p>"No &mdash;Oh, God! No!"</p>

<p>"Is that the truth? If you are lying to me it means my death."</p>

<p>The girl gazed at her in horror; tears sprang to her eyes:</p>

<p>"I couldn't &mdash;I couldn't!" she stammered in a choking voice.
"I've never before seen death&mdash;never seen how it came&mdash;how men
die! This&mdash;this killing is horrible, revolting!" She had laid
one trembling little hand on Ilse Dumont's bare shoulder. "I don't
want to have you killed; the idea of death makes me ill! I'm going
home&mdash;that is all I ask for&mdash;to go home&#11834;"</p>

<p>She dropped her pretty head and began to sob hysterically, standing
there under the growing daylight of the Boulevard, in her tattered
evening gown.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ilse Dumont threw both arms around her and kissed the
feverish, tear-wet face:</p>

<p>"You weren't meant for this!" she whispered. "You do it for money.
Go home. Do anything else for wages&mdash;anything except this!&mdash;<em>Anything</em>,
I tell you&#11834;"</p>

<p>Neeland's hand touched her arm:</p>

<p>"I have a cab. Are you going home with her?"</p>

<p>"I dare not," she said.</p>

<p>"Then will you take this Russian girl to her home, Sengoun?"
he asked. And added in a low voice: "She is one of your own people,
you know."</p>

<p>"All right," said Sengoun blissfully. "I'd take the devil home
if you asked me! Besides, I can talk to her about my regiment
on the way. That will be wonderful, Neeland! That will be quite
wonderful! I can talk to her in Russian about my regiment all
the way home!"</p>

<p>He laughed and looked at his friend, at Ilse Dumont, at the drooping
figure he was to take under his escort. He glanced down at his
own ragged attire where he stood hatless, collarless, one sleeve
of his evening coat ripped open to the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Isn't it wonderful!" he cried, bursting out into uncontrollable
laughter. "Neeland, my dear comrade, this has been the most delightfully
wonderful night of my entire life! But the great miracle is still
to come! Hurrah for a thousand lances! Hurrah! Town taken by Prince
Erlik! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>And he seized the young girl whom he was to escort to her home&mdash;wherever
that hazy locality might be&mdash;and carried her in his arms to the
taxicab, amid encouraging shouts of laughter from the line of
cavalrymen who had been watching the proceedings from the corner
of the rue Vilna.</p>

<p>That shout of Gallic appreciation inflamed Sengoun: he reached
for his hat, to lift and wave it, but found no hat on his head.
So he waved his tattered sleeve instead:</p>

<p>"Hurrah for France!" he shouted. "Hurrah for Russia! I'm Sengoun,
of the Terek! &mdash;And I am to have a thousand lances with which
to explain to the Germans my opinion of them and of their Emperor!"</p>

<p>The troopers cheered him from their stirrups, in spite of their
officers, who pretended to check their men.</p>

<p>"<em>Vive la France! Vive la Russie!</em>" they roared. "Forward
the Terek Cossacks!"</p>

<p>Sengoun turned to Ilse Dumont:</p>

<p>"Madame," he said, "in gratitude and admiration!"&mdash;and he gracefully
saluted her hand. Then, to his comrade: "Neeland!"&mdash;seizing both
the American's hands. "Such a night and such a comrade I shall
never forget! I adore our night together; I love you as a brother.
I shall see you before I go?"</p>

<p>"Surely, Sengoun, my dear comrade!"</p>

<p>"<em>Alors&mdash;au revoir!</em>" He sprang into the taxicab. "To
the Russian Embassy!" he called out; and turned to the half fainting
girl on the seat beside him.</p>

<p>"Where do you live, my dear?" he asked very gently, taking her
icy hand in his.</p>
