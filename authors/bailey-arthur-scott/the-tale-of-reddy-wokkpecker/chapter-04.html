<p>Reddy Woodpecker lost no time in making friends with his cousin Mr.
Flicker. Reddy knew well enough that most of the birds in the
neighborhood wished he hadn’t come there to live.  So he thought it wise
to be pleasant and polite to Mr. Flicker.  There was no knowing when he
might need one friend among so many enemies.  He even let Mr. Flicker
drum upon the strip of tin upon the roof of the barn.  But secretly
Reddy thought him a queer chap.
</p><p>"There’s one thing that’s very odd about you," Reddy said to Mr. Flicker
one day.  "If you’re a Woodpecker, why don’t you peck wood?  I’ve
noticed that you spend most of your time on the ground—when you’re not
drumming upon my tin."
</p><p>Mr. Flicker laughed.
</p><p>"Oh!" he said lightly, "we Flickers have found an easier way to get a
living than by drilling wood with our bills to find grubs.  We eat
ants," he explained. "And that’s why you see me on the ground so much,
because that’s where the ants live."  At the moment Mr. Flicker was on
the ground, while Reddy clung to the trunk of a tree near him.  And just
to prove the truth of his statement Mr. Flicker made a quick jab into
the turf with his bill.  He pulled his bill out at once, giving Reddy
Woodpecker a glimpse of an ant before he swallowed it.
</p><p>Reddy Woodpecker stared at him in amazement.  "Where’s your home?" he
asked Mr. Flicker.  "Is your home on the ground?"
</p><p>"Bless you, no!" cried Mr. Flicker. "I’m no ground bird.  My wife and I
have a fine hole in an old apple tree in the orchard."
</p><p>Reddy Woodpecker had to approve of that, anyhow.  So he nodded his
red-capped head.
</p><p>"You’re sensible in one way, at least," he remarked.  "That’s the way to
live, if only you build high enough, out of harm’s way."
</p><p>Mr. Flicker grinned at him.
</p><p>"It’s plain that you don’t know we Flickers are sometimes called
High-holes," he said, "because of the way we nest."
</p><p>"Ah!  So you have two names, eh?" Reddy Woodpecker exclaimed, as he
speared a grub with his tongue and drew it out from under a bit of bark.
"I should think you’d find that confusing. I should think you’d forget
who you were, sometimes."
</p><p>"Oh!  It’s easy when you get used to it," Mr. Flicker replied.  He
paused to capture another ant.  And then he added, "I have more than
just two names.  I have one hundred and twenty-four in all."
</p><p>"My goodness!" cried Reddy.  He was so astonished that he missed a stab
at a fine grub that was right under his nose. "My goodness!  Has your
wife as many names as that?"
</p><p>"Yes!" said Mr. Flicker.
</p><p>"And your children?"
</p><p>Mr. Flicker nodded.
</p><p>"Sakes alive!" Reddy exclaimed. "How do you ever feed them all?"
</p><p>Mr. Flicker gave a long, rolling, curious laugh.
</p><p>"We feed the children under only one name," he explained, "although I
must confess it sometimes seems to me that each of them eats enough for
one hundred and twenty-four youngsters."
</p><p>"I know how that is," said Reddy Woodpecker.  "My home is in a tree in
the orchard, too.  And I’m raising a family of four myself."
