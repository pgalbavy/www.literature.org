<p><em>TOM’S NEW </em>employer was Oliver Burton. He had come from
New Jersey originally with the intention of going to the mines,
but he was shrewd enough to see, on landing in San Francisco,
that trading was a more certain means of getting rich than mining.
He established himself in the city, therefore, bought out a man
who was compelled by sickness to retire from active business,
and was now rich. Though occasionally irritable, he was in the
main just and easy to get along with, and Tom soon got into favor.</p>

<p>Our hero had never worked, but he was sharp and diligent, and
he did not need to be told the same thing twice. So at the end
of the first week his employer said:</p>

<p>"Well, Tom, you have been with me a week, and for a green hand
you have done remarkably well."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Tom; "I have tried to do my duty faithfully."</p>

<p>"You have. Moreover, I am convinced of your honesty."</p>

<p>"You need have no fears on that score," said Tom proudly.</p>

<p>"I have not, and experience teaches me that this is quite as
important as a capacity for business. Why, my last clerk was a
capital salesman—knew how to please customers and influence trade—but
contrived to swindle me out of several hundred dollars in three
months."</p>

<p>"That wasn’t very satisfactory," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I should say not. But what I am coming at is this—I should like
to have you remain with me. What wages will satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"You are a better judge than I am. What did you give your last
clerk?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five dollars a week and board. You are a green hand,
and several years younger, but in consideration of your honesty,
in which I feel full confidence, I will give you twenty."</p>

<p>"That will satisfy me, sir," said Tom promptly.</p>

<p>"Then here are your first two week’s wages."</p>

<p>Tom took the money—it was in gold—with pride and pleasure. It
was no novelty to him to have considerable money, but excepting
the three dollars which he had received for carrying a bundle,
this was the first money he had actually earned, and he felt pleased
accordingly.</p>

<p>"Twenty dollars and my board for a week’s work!" he said to himself.
"Now I really begin to feel that I am of some use in the world.
It’s a good deal better than leading an idle life."</p>

<p>It may be remarked also, that Tom had lost with his property
the old bullying spirit which gave him the title by which he was
known at the beginning of this story. He still retained, however,
the spirit and courage which in his case had accompanied it; and
this was fortunate, for he was in a country where at that time
the laws had not yet obtained that ascendency which they possess
in older settlements. The time was not far off when his courage
was to be tested.</p>

<p>About three weeks after his entrance into the store, Mr. Burton
left the city for a visit of several days into the interior. By
this time Tom knew enough of the business to be intrusted with
the sole charge.</p>

<p>"I shouldn’t have dared to leave my former clerk," said Mr. Burton,
"but I am sure I can trust you."</p>

<p>"You can," said Tom promptly. "I may not be able to fill your
place, but I’ll do the best I can."</p>

<p>"I am convinced of it. You will sleep in the store; for though
burglaries are not frequent, there might be an attempt to open
the store."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You won’t be afraid to remain here alone?"</p>

<p>"Afraid!" exclaimed Tom. "I hope not. I should be ashamed of
myself if I were."</p>

<p>"I shall leave my revolver, and I expect you to use it if necessary.
Do you understand its use?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I have no further directions to give. I cannot tell exactly
how many days I shall be absent."</p>

<p>"Don’t hurry home, sir. All will go well."</p>

<p>"It’s odd how much confidence I have in that boy," said Mr. Burton
to himself. "He says he is only sixteen, but he’s as cool and
self-reliant as a man of twenty-five. He has been well educated,
too, I judge from his manners and conversation. I feel fortunate
in securing him."</p>

<p>On the fourth night after Mr. Burton’s departure, Tom went to
bed at his usual hour. His bed was made up on the floor, about
the center. He was unusually fatigued, and this no doubt accounted
for his sleeping sounder than common. Something roused him at
last. At first he thought, in his bewilderment, that it was Mr.
Burton who had shaken him, but he was quickly undeceived.</p>

<p>Lifting his head, he saw a sinister face, rough and unshaven,
bending over him.</p>

<p>"What!" he commenced, but the other interrupted him in a stern
whisper.</p>

<p>"Speak low, boy! Make no alarm, or by the powers above I’ll kill
you instantly. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Tom was now thoroughly awake. He comprehended that this man was
one against whom it was his duty to defend the store and its contents.
On account of the soundness of his sleep he had not heard him
effect his entrance.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You can guess why I am here. I want all the money you have in
this store."</p>

<p>"You had better leave here at once," said Tom, having recourse
to stratagem. "Suppose my employer should have heard you and come
in."</p>

<p>"Suppose he don’t," said the burglar, with a sneer. "I know as
well as you that he is in the country. You can’t play any of your
games on me, boy."</p>

<p>"He has been in the country."</p>

<p>"And he is there now. Boy, I can’t waste time. Do you see this?"
and he drew a formidable knife from its sheath.</p>

<p>"Yes, I see it," said our hero.</p>

<p>"You will feel it also," said the burglar, "if you don’t show
me where you keep your gold, and be quick about it."</p>

<p>Tom was at his wits’ end. There were eight hundred dollars in
gold in the store, and moreover it was all kept together. If he
could have saved the rest by delivering to the burglar a hundred
dollars, he would not have scrupled to do this, feeling that in
so doing he would do the best thing possible, and obtain Mr. Burton’s
approval. But this was impossible. It must be the whole or none,
and it seemed probable that the whole would be taken. He was only
a boy—strong of his age, it is true, but no match for the burly
ruffian who, with drawn knife, was looking down upon him.</p>

<p>Again, suppose he surrendered the money, how could he convince
Mr. Burton that he did it upon compulsion? Might it not be supposed
that the burglar was a confederate of his own, whom he had voluntarily
admitted into the store? Might it not even be suspected that there
had been no burglary at all, but that he himself had appropriated
the money, and trumped up a story to conceal his guilt.</p>

<p>These thoughts passed through his mind in a much shorter time
than I have taken to record them. But slight as the delay was,
it was too great for the impatience of the ruffian.</p>

<p>"If you don’t get up before I count three," he said, "you shall
have a taste of this knife."</p>
