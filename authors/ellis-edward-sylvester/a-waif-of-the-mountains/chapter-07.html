<p>Mr. Brush glanced nervously around, to learn whether any of his
friends were within hearing, shuddering to think what the consequences
might be. He believed that he could explain the matter to some
of the folks, but the majority were so radical in their views
that they would refuse to admit the distinction, and would take
him to task for teaching improper language to his young pupil.
It caused him another shudder at the thought that the same penalty
that Wade Ruggles had undergone might be visited upon him, though
it is doubtful if the issue would have been similar.</p>

<p>"Ahem, Miss Nellie, when we go back home, will you promise me
to say nothing about this part of your lesson?"</p>

<p>"You mean 'bout that bad word?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;let's forget all about it."</p>

<p>"I'll try, but mebbe I'll forget to forget it."</p>

<p>"Likely enough," gloomily reflected the parson; "suppose we try
some other words. Ah, we have a visitor."</p>

<p>At that moment Budge Isham climbed into view and sauntered smilingly
toward them. Brush added a whispered warning to the little one
not to forget her promise, though, since Isham was an educated
man, there ought not to have been anything to fear in his case,
but the teacher knew his waggish nature, and had good reason to
fear the mischief he would delight in creating.</p>

<p>"Good day," was his cheery greeting, as he came up; "I hope I
am not intruding, but I thought I should like to see how you are
getting on, Nellie."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Brush says I am learning real fast; I can spell 'cat,'
and 'dog,' and 'dam.'"</p>

<p>Budge raised his hands in horror.</p>

<p>"What in the name of heaven, parson, does she mean?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Isham," said the gentleman, severely, "are you aware that
you are using improper language in the presence of this young
lady?"</p>

<p>"Explain yourself."</p>

<p>"It is wrong for you to appeal to heaven on so trifling a question;
it is such a near approach to profanity that the dividing line
is imperceptible. I am sorry you forgot yourself, but I will overlook
it this time."</p>

<p>Budge was really frightened, for though the distinction was quite
fine, he felt there was some justice in the position of the parson,
but he bluffed it out.</p>

<p>"I doubt whether a jury would find me guilty, and in the meantime
explain the remark just made by Nellie, if you please."</p>

<p>Thus cornered, the parson made a clean breast of it. Isham assumed
a grave expression.</p>

<p>"The only criticism I can make is upon your taste in selecting
a word, susceptible of a questionable meaning. You know as well
as I that if this should be submitted to a jury at the Heavenly
Bower this evening, the majority would sit down on you, and it
would be hard work for you to escape the penalty."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it would," responded the parson; "it was a piece
of forgetfulness on my part&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Which is the plea that Bidwell and Ruggles made, but it didn't
answer. However, I'll say nothing about it, knowing you will be
more careful in the future, while I shall not forget to put a
bridle on my own tongue. The trouble, however," he added with
a smile, "is to make <em>her</em> overlook it."</p>

<p>"She has promised she will do so."</p>

<p>"Since that promise was made just before I got here, she has
shown how readily she can forget it."</p>

<p>"I will give her a longer lesson than usual and thus drive all
remembrance out of her mind," said the parson resolutely.</p>

<p>Budge Isham folded his arms, prepared to look on and listen,
but the queen of the proceedings checked it all by an unexpected
veto.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brush, I feel so tired."</p>

<p>Her face wore a bored expression and she looked wistfully away
from the blackboard toward the cabins below them.</p>

<p>"Does your head hurt you?" inquired the teacher with much solicitude,
while the single auditor was ready to join in the protest.</p>

<p>"No, but mebbe it will hurt me one of these days."</p>

<p>"It isn't wise, parson, to force the child; a great deal of injury
is done to children by cramming their heads with useless knowledge."</p>

<p>The teacher could not feel sure that this counsel was disinterested,
for there could be no danger of his taxing the mental powers of
the little one too severely, but her protest could not pass unheeded.</p>

<p>"You have done very well, my child; you are learning fast, so
we'll leave the spelling for to-morrow. Suppose we now try the
commandments: can you repeat the first one?"</p>

<p>Nellie gave it correctly, as she did with slight assistance,
the remaining ones. She was certainly gifted with a remarkable
memory and possessed an unusually bright mind. Budge Isham was
impressed by her repetition of the decalogue, whose meaning she
was unable fully to grasp. His frivolous disposition vanished,
as he looked upon the innocent child and watched the lips from
which the sacred words flowed. He quietly decided that it would
be inexcusably mean to seek any amusement at the expense of the
parson, and it may as well be added that he never afterward referred
to the incident, while it seemed to have passed wholly from the
mind of Nellie herself. At the conclusion of the lesson, Budge
complimented teacher and pupil and said he would be glad to certify
that Mr. Brush was the best teacher in New Constantinople, and
that it was impossible for any one to take his place. Then he
bade them good day and walked thoughtfully away, leaving them
once more to themselves.</p>

<p>These were the most precious moments of all to the teacher, when
the formal lesson was completed, and he sat down for a little
talk with his pupil. He occupied the stone which served her for
a seat, while one arm loosely clasped the figure which stood between
his knees. She patted his cheek, played with his rough collar
and shaggy whiskers, while as he listened and replied to her prattle,
felt as never before the truth of the declaration that of such
is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brush," she finally said, "do you know why I love you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it must be because I am so handsome," he replied with
a smile.</p>

<p>"No; it isn't that, for you <em>ain't</em> handsome."</p>

<p>"Whew! but you are not afraid to speak the truth, little one,
and I hope you will always do that. No; I don't know why you love
me, unless you are so good yourself that you can't help it."</p>

<p>This was not exactly clear to the little one, and she stood silent
for a minute, gently fingering his long beard. Then she thought
it best to clear up the mystery without further parley.</p>

<p>"I love you 'cause you're good."</p>

<p>Even though the avowal was delightful, it caused a pang, like
a knife-thrust from his accusing conscience.</p>

<p>"I am thankful to hear you say that, but, Nellie, I am not good."</p>

<p>"Yes, you is, but if you ain't good, why ain't you good?"</p>

<p>The logic of the reply of the adult was of the same grade as
that of the child.</p>

<p>"I suppose the true reason is because I am bad. I am sorry to
say it, but I have drifted far away from where I ought to be."</p>

<p>The dimpled hand continued to fondle the whiskers, and the little
brain was busy, but a wisdom that was more than human guided it.
Turning those lustrous blue eyes upon him she softly asked:</p>

<p>"Will you do what I ask you?"</p>

<p>He almost gasped, for he instinctively suspected what was coming,
but he answered without hesitation:</p>

<p>"If it is my power I will do it, though it kills me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want it to kill you; this won't hurt you; will you
do it, Mr. Brush?"</p>

<p>"Yes, God helping me."</p>

<p>"Do like Mr. Ruggles."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked the parson with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>"Don't drink any more of that red water, which makes men talk
loud and sometimes say bad words."</p>

<p>"Heavens!" thought the parson; "she little dreams what she is
asking me, but it is not she but some One who is thus calling
me back to duty. Yes, my child, I will do what you ask."</p>

<p>"You is as good and nice as you can be now, but then you will
be a good deal gooder and nicer," said she, warmly kissing him.</p>

<p>"I hope so," he added, rising to his feet, with the feeling that
he was not himself but some one else, and that that some one else
was the young man away among the distant hills of Missouri, before
he wandered to the West, and in doing so, wandered from the path
along which he had attempted to guide and lead others.</p>

<p>"I call myself her teacher," he mused, as he reached down and
took the tiny hand in his own, "but she is the teacher and I am
the pupil."</p>

<p>They had started in the direction of the cabins, when they heard
curious shouts and outcries in that direction. "There's something
strange going on down there," he said, peering toward the point;
"I wonder what it can be; let us hurry and find out."</p>

<p>Firmly clasping her hand, the two hastened down the incline,
wondering what it was that caused all the noise and confusion.</p>
