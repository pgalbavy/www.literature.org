<p>BOBBY BOBOLINK did not reach Pleasant Valley in time to spend May Day
with his old friends of the summer before. And although everybody was
disappointed not to see him--and hear him--the feathered folk tried to
be cheerful and told one another that Bobby ought to arrive almost any
day.
</p>
<p>"He always finds it hard to leave the rice fields in the South," Mr.
Red-winged Blackbird observed with a knowing wink at old Mr. Crow,
as the two stopped for a chat on the morning after May Day. "It's
rice-planting time in the South," Mr. Red-winged Blackbird explained.
"Somewhat like corn-planting time here!" And he winked once more.
</p><p>Although Mr. Crow was in the habit of scratching up Farmer Green's
newly-planted corn, just as Bobby Bobolink uncovered the freshly-sown
rice in the South, Mr. Crow never cared to have any of his neighbors
even hint that he did such a thing. And now he glared at Mr. Red-winged
Blackbird, who continued to wink at him.
</p><p>"Is there something in your eye?" Mr. Crow inquired in his coldest
manner.
</p><p>Mr. Red-winged Blackbird had no wish to make Mr. Crow angry. So he
stopped winking at once.
</p><p>"When you see your friend Bobby Bobolink you'd better tell him to leave
the corn strictly alone," Mr. Crow remarked. "Farmer Green expects to
begin planting in about three weeks. And he counts on me to watch the
field for him. If I catch Bobby Bobolink there he'll wish he had stayed
in the rice fields, down South."
</p><p>Mr. Red-winged Blackbird smiled. And he told old Mr. Crow not to worry.
</p><p>"Bobby Bobolink won't touch the corn," he said. "During the first half
of the summer he lives on such things as caterpillars and grasshoppers,
with a bit of grass-seed now and then."
</p><p>Old Mr. Crow replied that he was glad to know that.
</p><p>"He's wise to leave the corn alone," he added. "If Farmer Green was on
the lookout for him--with a gun handy--Bobby Bobolink wouldn't act so
care-free as he generally does. He wouldn't sing such rollicking songs
in the meadow. And now that you've mentioned how he spends his springs
in the South, I don't wonder that he appears glad to get to Pleasant
Valley. For you may well believe that folks are not so fond of him down
there where the rice grows. And unless I'm much mistaken the planters
actually order him out of their fields."
</p><p>Mr. Red-winged Blackbird told Mr. Crow that he hadn't a doubt that
everything Mr. Crow said was so. And he was just about to remark that
he should think Mr. Crow must lead a care-free, happy-go-lucky life in
winter, in the South, because Farmer Green always stayed in Pleasant
Valley the whole year round. But as he opened his bill to speak he heard
a sound over in the meadow that made him forget what was on the tip of
his tongue.
</p><p>"Did you hear that song?" he cried. "Hurrah!"
</p><p>Old Mr. Crow cocked his head on one side and listened. "Yes!" he
agreed. "There's no doubt about it. Bobby Bobolink is here at last!"
