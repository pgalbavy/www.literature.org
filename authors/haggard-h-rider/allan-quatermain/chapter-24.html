<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A year has elapsed since our most dear friend Allan Quatermain wrote the
words ‘<u>I have spoken</u>’ at the end of his record of our adventures. Nor
should I have ventured to make any additions to the record had it not
happened that by a most strange accident a chance has arisen of its
being conveyed to England. The chance is but a faint one, it is true;
but, as it is not probable that another will arise in our lifetimes,
Good and myself think that we may as well avail ourselves of it, such as
it is. During the last six months several Frontier Commissions have
been at work on the various boundaries of Zu-Vendis, with a view of
discovering whether there exists any possible means of ingress or egress
from the country, with the result that a channel of communication with
the outer world hitherto overlooked has been discovered. This channel,
apparently the only one (for I have discovered that it was by it that
the native who ultimately reached Mr Mackenzie’s mission station,
and whose arrival in the country, together with the fact of his
expulsion--for he <u>did</u> arrive about three years before ourselves--was
for reasons of their own kept a dead secret by the priests to whom he
was brought), is about to be effectually closed. But before this is
done, a messenger is to be despatched bearing with him this manuscript,
and also one or two letters from Good to his friends, and from myself to
my brother George, whom it deeply grieves me to think I shall never see
again, informing them, as our next heirs, that they are welcome to our
effects in England, if the Court of Probate will allow them to take them
{Endnote 22}, inasmuchas we have made up our minds never to return to
Europe. Indeed, it would be impossible for us to leave Zu-Vendis even if
we wished to do so.
</p>
<p>The messenger who is to go--and I wish him joy of his journey--is
Alphonse. For a long while he has been wearied to death of Zu-Vendis
and its inhabitants. ‘Oh, oui, c’est beau,’ he says, with an expressive
shrug; ‘mais je m’ennuie; ce n’est pas chic.’ Again, he complains
dreadfully of the absence of cafes and theatres, and moans continually
for his lost Annette, of whom he says he dreams three times a week. But
I fancy his secret cause of disgust at the country, putting aside the
homesickness to which every Frenchman is subject, is that the people
here laugh at him so dreadfully about his conduct on the occasion of the
great battle of the Pass about eighteen months ago, when he hid beneath
a banner in Sorais’s tent in order to avoid being sent forth to fight,
which he says would have gone against his conscience. Even the little
boys call out at him in the streets, thereby offending his pride and
making his life unbearable. At any rate, he has determined to brave the
horrors of a journey of almost unprecedented difficulty and danger, and
also to run the risk of falling into the hands of the French police
to answer for a certain little indiscretion of his own some years old
(though I do not consider that a very serious matter), rather than
remain in ce triste pays. Poor Alphonse! we shall be very sorry to part
with him; but I sincerely trust, for his own sake and also for the sake
of this history, which is, I think, worth giving to the world, that he
may arrive in safety. If he does, and can carry the treasure we have
provided him with in the shape of bars of solid gold, he will be,
comparatively speaking, a rich man for life, and well able to marry his
Annette, if she is still in the land of the living and willing to marry
her Alphonse.
</p><p>Anyhow, on the chance, I may as well add a word or two to dear old
Quatermain’s narrative.
</p><p>He died at dawn on the day following that on which he wrote the last
words of the last chapter. Nyleptha, Good and myself were present, and a
most touching and yet in its way beautiful scene it was. An hour before
the daybreak it became apparent to us that he was sinking, and our
distress was very keen. Indeed, Good melted into tears at the idea--a
fact that called forth a last gentle flicker of humour from our dying
friend, for even at that hour he could be humorous. Good’s emotion had,
by loosening the muscles, naturally caused his eyeglass to fall from
its accustomed place, and Quatermain, who always observed everything,
observed this also.
</p><p>‘At last,’ he gasped, with an attempt at a smile, ‘I have seen Good
without his eyeglass.’
</p><p>After that he said no more till the day broke, when he asked to be
lifted up to watch the rising of the sun for the last time.
</p><p>‘In a very few minutes,’ he said, after gazing earnestly at it, ‘I shall
have passed through those golden gates.’
</p><p>Ten minutes afterwards he raised himself and looked us fixedly in the
face.
</p><p>‘I am going a stranger journey than any we have ever taken together.
Think of me sometimes,’ he murmured. ‘God bless you all. I shall wait
for you.’ And with a sigh he fell back dead.
</p><p>And so passed away a character that I consider went as near perfection
as any it has ever been my lot to encounter.
</p><p>Tender, constant, humorous, and possessing of many of the qualities that
go to make a poet, he was yet almost unrivalled as a man of action and
a citizen of the world. I never knew any one so competent to form an
accurate judgment of men and their motives. ‘I have studied human nature
all my life,’ he would say, ‘and I ought to know something about it,’
and he certainly did. He had but two faults--one was his excessive
modesty, and the other a slight tendency which he had to be jealous of
anybody on whom he concentrated his affections. As regards the first of
these points, anybody who reads what he has written will be able to form
his own opinion; but I will add one last instance of it.
</p><p>As the reader will doubtless remember, it is a favourite trick of his to
talk of himself as a timid man, whereas really, though very cautious,
he possessed a most intrepid spirit, and, what is more, never lost his
head. Well, in the great battle of the Pass, where he got the wound that
finally killed him, one would imagine from the account which he gives
of the occurrence that it was a chance blow that fell on him in the
scrimmage. As a matter of fact, however, he was wounded in a most
gallant and successful attempt to save Good’s life, at the risk and, as
it ultimately turned out, at the cost of his own. Good was down on the
ground, and one of Nasta’s highlanders was about to dispatch him, when
Quatermain threw himself on to his prostrate form and received the blow
on his own body, and then, rising, killed the soldier.
</p><p>As regards his jealousy, a single instance which I give in justice to
myself and Nyleptha will suffice. The reader will, perhaps, recollect
that in one or two places he speaks as though Nyleptha monopolized me,
and he was left by both of us rather out in the cold. Now Nyleptha is
not perfect, any more than any other woman is, and she may be a little
exigeante at times, but as regards Quatermain the whole thing is pure
imagination. Thus when he complains about my not coming to see him when
he is ill, the fact was that, in spite of my entreaties, the doctors
positively forbade it. Those little remarks of his pained me very much
when I read them, for I loved Quatermain as dearly as though he were
my own father, and should never have dreamed of allowing my marriage to
interfere with that affection. But let it pass; it is, after all, but
one little weakness, which makes no great show among so many and such
lovable virtues.
</p><p>Well, he died, and Good read the Burial Service over him in the presence
of Nyleptha and myself; and then his remains were, in deference to the
popular clamour, accorded a great public funeral, or rather cremation. I
could not help thinking, however, as I marched in that long and splendid
procession up to the Temple, how he would have hated the whole thing
could he have been there to see it, for he had a horror of ostentation.
</p><p>And so, a few minutes before sunset, on the third night after his death,
they laid him on the brazen flooring before the altar, and waited for
the last ray of the setting sun to fall upon his face. Presently it
came, and struck him like a golden arrow, crowning the pale brows with
glory, and then the trumpets blew, and the flooring revolved, and all
that remained of our beloved friend fell into the furnace below.
</p><p>We shall never see his like again if we live a hundred years. He was
the ablest man, the truest gentleman, the firmest friend, the finest
sportsman, and, I believe, the best shot in all Africa.
</p><p>And so ended the very remarkable and adventurous life of Hunter
Quatermain.
</p>
<p>Since then things have gone very well with us. Good has been, and still
is, busily employed in the construction of a navy on Lake Milosis and
another of the large lakes, by means of which we hope to be able to
increase trade and commerce, and also to overcome some very troublesome
and warlike sections of the population who live upon their borders. Poor
fellow! he is beginning to get over the sad death of that misguided but
most attractive woman, Sorais, but it is a sad blow to him, for he was
really deeply attached to her. I hope, however, that he will in time
make a suitable marriage and get that unhappy business out of his head.
Nyleptha has one or two young ladies in view, especially a daughter of
Nasta’s (who was a widower), a very fine imperial-looking girl, but with
too much of her father’s intriguing, and yet haughty, spirit to suit my
taste.
</p><p>As for myself, I should scarcely know where to begin if I set to work
to describe my doings, so I had best leave them undescribed, and content
myself with saying that, on the whole, I am getting on very well in my
curious position of King-Consort--better, indeed, than I had any right
to expect. But, of course, it is not all plain sailing, and I find the
responsibilities very heavy. Still, I hope to be able to do some good in
my time, and I intend to devote myself to two great ends--namely, to the
consolidation of the various clans which together make up the Zu-Vendi
people, under one strong central government, and to the sapping of the
power of the priesthood. The first of these reforms will, if it can
be carried out, put an end to the disastrous civil wars that have for
centuries devastated this country; and the second, besides removing a
source of political danger, will pave the road for the introduction of
true religion in the place of this senseless Sun worship. I yet hope to
see the shadow of the Cross of Christ lying on the golden dome of the
Flower Temple; or, if I do not, that my successors may.
</p><p>There is one more thing that I intend to devote myself to, and that is
the total exclusion of all foreigners from Zu-Vendis. Not, indeed, that
any more are ever likely to get here, but if they do, I warn them fairly
that they will be shown the shortest way out of the country. I do not
say this from any sense of inhospitality, but because I am convinced of
the sacred duty that rests upon me of preserving to this, on the
whole, upright and generous-hearted people the blessings of comparative
barbarism. Where would all my brave army be if some enterprising rascal
were to attack us with field-guns and Martini-Henrys? I cannot see that
gunpowder, telegraphs, steam, daily newspapers, universal suffrage,
etc., etc., have made mankind one whit the happier than they used to
be, and I am certain that they have brought many evils in their train.
I have no fancy for handing over this beautiful country to be torn and
fought for by speculators, tourists, politicians and teachers, whose
voice is as the voice of Babel, just as those horrible creatures in the
valley of the underground river tore and fought for the body of the wild
swan; nor will I endow it with the greed, drunkenness, new diseases,
gunpowder, and general demoralization which chiefly mark the progress
of civilization amongst unsophisticated peoples. If in due course it
pleases Providence to throw Zu-Vendis open to the world, that is another
matter; but of myself I will not take the responsibility, and I may add
that Good entirely approves of my decision. Farewell.
</p><p>Henry Curtis
</p>
<p>December 15, 18--.
</p><p>PS--I quite forgot to say that about nine months ago Nyleptha (who
is very well and, in my eyes at any rate, more beautiful than ever)
presented me with a son and heir. He is a regular curly-haired,
blue-eyed young Englishman in looks, and, though he is destined, if he
lives, to inherit the throne of Zu-Vendis, I hope I may be able to bring
him up to become what an English gentleman should be, and generally
is--which is to my mind even a prouder and a finer thing than being
born heir apparent to the great House of the Stairway, and, indeed, the
highest rank that a man can reach upon this earth.

<p>NOTE BY GEORGE CURTIS, Esq.
</p>
<p>The MS of this history, addressed to me in the handwriting of my dear
brother Henry Curtis, whom we had given up for dead, and bearing the
Aden postmark, reached me in safety on December 20, 18--, or a little
more than two years after it left his hands in the far centre of Africa,
and I hasten to give the astonishing story it contains to the world.
Speaking for myself, I have read it with very mixed feelings; for though
it is a great relief to know that he and Good are alive and strangely
prosperous, I cannot but feel that for me and for all their friends they
might as well be dead, since we can never hope to see them more.
</p><p>They have cut themselves off from old England and from their homes and
their relations for ever, and perhaps, under the circumstances, they
were right and wise to do so.
</p><p>How the MS came to be posted I have been quite unable to discover; but
I presume, from the fact of its being posted at all, that the little
Frenchman, Alphonse, accomplished his hazardous journey in safety. I
have, however, advertised for him and caused various inquiries to
be made in Marseilles and elsewhere with a view of discovering his
whereabouts, but so far without the slightest success. Possibly he is
dead, and the packet was posted by another hand; or possibly he is now
happily wedded to his Annette, but still fears the vengeance of the law,
and prefers to remain incognito. I cannot say, I have not yet abandoned
my hopes of finding him, but I am bound to say that they grow fainter
day by day, and one great obstacle to my search is that nowhere in
the whole history does Mr Quatermain mention his surname. He is always
spoken of as ‘Alphonse’, and there are so many Alphonses. The letters
which my brother Henry says he is sending with the packet of manuscript
have never arrived, so I presume that they are lost or destroyed.

<p><strong>AUTHORITIES</strong>
</p>
<p>A novelist is not usually asked, like a historian, for his ‘Quellen’.
As I have, however, judging from certain experiences in the past,
some reason to anticipate such a demand, I wish to acknowledge my
indebtedness to Mr Thomson’s admirable history of travel ‘Through Masai
Land’ for much information as to the habits and customs of the tribes
inhabiting that portion of the East Coast, and the country where
they live; also to my brother, John G. Haggard, RN, HBM’s consul at
Madagascar, and formerly consul at Lamu, for many details furnished by
him of the mode of life and war of those engaging people the Masai; also
to my sister-in-law, Mrs John Haggard, who kindly put the lines of p.
183 into rhyme for me; also to an extract in a review from some book of
travel of which I cannot recollect the name, to which I owe the idea of
the great crabs in the valley of the subterranean river. {Endnote 23}
But if I remember right, the crabs in the book when irritated projected
their eyes quite out of their heads. I regret that I was not able to
‘plagiarize’ this effect, but I felt that, although crabs may, and
doubtless do, behave thus in real life, in romance they ‘will not do
so.’
</p><p>There is an underground river in ‘Peter Wilkins’, but at the time of
writing the foregoing pages I had not read that quaint but entertaining
work.
</p><p>It has been pointed out to me that there exists a similarity between the
scene of Umslopogaas frightening Alphonse with his axe and a scene in
Far from the Madding Crowd. I regret this coincidence, and believe that
the talented author of that work will not be inclined to accuse me of
literary immorality on its account.
</p><p>Finally, I may say that Mr Quatermain’s little Frenchman appears to
belong to the same class of beings as those English ladies whose long
yellow teeth and feet of enormous size excite our hearty amusement in
the pages of the illustrated Gallic press.

<p>Endnote 12
</p><p>There is another theory which might account for the origin of the
Zu-Vendi which does not seem to have struck my friend Mr Quatermain
and his companions, and that is, that they are descendants of the
Phoenicians. The cradle of the Phoenician race is supposed to have
been on the western shore of the Persian Gulf. Thence, as there is
good evidence to show, they emigrated in two streams, one of which took
possession of the shores of Palestine, while the other is supposed by
savants to have immigrated down the coast of Eastern Africa where,
near Mozambique, signs and remains of their occupation are not wanting.
Indeed, it would have been very extraordinary if they did not, when
leaving the Persian Gulf, make straight for the East Coast, seeing that
the north-east monsoon blows for six months in the year dead in that
direction, while for the other six months it blows back again. And, by
the way of illustrating the probability, I may add that to this day a
very extensive trade is carried on between the Persian Gulf and Lamu and
other East African ports as far south as Madagascar, which is of course
the ancient Ebony Isle of the ‘Arabian Nights’.--Editor.
</p>
<p>Endnote 13
</p><p>There are twenty-two letters in the Phoenician alphabet (see Appendix,
Maspero’s Histoire ancienne des peuples de l’Orient, p. 746, etc.)
Unfortunately Mr Quatermain gives us no specimen of the Zu-Vendi

substantiating the theory advanced in the note on p. 149.--Editor.
