<p>The darkness fell, but rose again, and as each day spread widely
over the earth and parted them from the strange day in the forest
when they had been forced to tell each other what they wanted,
this wish of theirs was revealed to other people, and in the process
became slightly strange to themselves. Apparently it was not anything
unusual that had happened; it was that they had become engaged
to marry each other. The world, which consisted for the most part
of the hotel and the villa, expressed itself glad on the whole
that two people should marry, and allowed them to see that they
were not expected to take part in the work which has to be done
in order that the world shall go on, but might absent themselves
for a time. They were accordingly left alone until they felt the
silence as if, playing in a vast church, the door had been shut
on them. They were driven to walk alone, and sit alone, to visit
secret places where the flowers had never been picked and the
trees were solitary. In solitude they could express those beautiful
but too vast desires which were so oddly uncomfortable to the
ears of other men and women&mdash;desires for a world, such as their
own world which contained two people seemed to them to be, where
people knew each other intimately and thus judged each other by
what was good, and never quarrelled, because that was waste of
time.</p>

<p>They would talk of such questions among books, or out in the
sun, or sitting in the shade of a tree undisturbed. They were
no longer embarrassed, or half-choked with meaning which could
not express itself; they were not afraid of each other, or, like
travellers down a twisting river, dazzled with sudden beauties
when the corner is turned; the unexpected happened, but even the
ordinary was lovable, and in many ways preferable to the ecstatic
and mysterious, for it was refreshingly solid, and called out
effort, and effort under such circumstances was not effort but
delight.</p>

<p>While Rachel played the piano, Terence sat near her, engaged,
as far as the occasional writing of a word in pencil testified,
in shaping the world as it appeared to him now that he and Rachel
were going to be married. It was different certainly. The book
called <em>Silence</em> would not now be the same book that it
would have been. He would then put down his pencil and stare in
front of him, and wonder in what respects the world was different&mdash;it
had, perhaps, more solidity, more coherence, more importance,
greater depth. Why, even the earth sometimes seemed to him very
deep; not carved into hills and cities and fields, but heaped
in great masses. He would look out of the window for ten minutes
at a time; but no, he did not care for the earth swept of human
beings. He liked human beings&mdash;he liked them, he suspected, better
than Rachel did. There she was, swaying enthusiastically over
her music, quite forgetful of him,&mdash;but he liked that quality
in her. He liked the impersonality which it produced in her. At
last, having written down a series of little sentences, with notes
of interrogation attached to them, he observed aloud, "'Women&mdash;under
the heading Women I've written:</p>

<p>"'Not really vainer than men. Lack of self-confidence at the
base of most serious faults. Dislike of own sex traditional, or
founded on fact? Every woman not so much a rake at heart, as an
optimist, because they don't think.' What do you say, Rachel?"
He paused with his pencil in his hand and a sheet of paper on
his knee.</p>

<p>Rachel said nothing. Up and up the steep spiral of a very late
Beethoven sonata she climbed, like a person ascending a ruined
staircase, energetically at first, then more laboriously advancing
her feet with effort until she could go no higher and returned
with a run to begin at the very bottom again.</p>

<p>"'Again, it's the fashion now to say that women are more practical
and less idealistic than men, also that they have considerable
organising ability but no sense of honour'&mdash;query, what is meant
by masculine term, honour?&mdash;what corresponds to it in your sex?
Eh?"</p>

<p>Attacking her staircase once more, Rachel again neglected this
opportunity of revealing the secrets of her sex. She had, indeed,
advanced so far in the pursuit of wisdom that she allowed these
secrets to rest undisturbed; it seemed to be reserved for a later
generation to discuss them philosophically.</p>

<p>Crashing down a final chord with her left hand, she exclaimed
at last, swinging round upon him:</p>

<p>"No, Terence, it's no good; here am I, the best musician in South
America, not to speak of Europe and Asia, and I can't play a note
because of you in the room interrupting me every other second."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to realise that that's what I've been aiming
at for the last half-hour," he remarked. "I've no objection to
nice simple tunes&mdash;indeed, I find them very helpful to my literary
composition, but that kind of thing is merely like an unfortunate
old dog going round on its hind legs in the rain."</p>

<p>He began turning over the little sheets of note-paper which were
scattered on the table, conveying the congratulations of their
friends.</p>

<p>"'&mdash;all possible wishes for all possible happiness,'" he read;
"correct, but not very vivid, are they?"</p>

<p>"They're sheer nonsense!" Rachel exclaimed. "Think of words compared
with sounds!" she continued. "Think of novels and plays and histories&mdash;"
Perched on the edge of the table, she stirred the red and yellow
volumes contemptuously. She seemed to herself to be in a position
where she could despise all human learning. Terence looked at
them too.</p>

<p>"God, Rachel, you do read trash!" he exclaimed. "And you're behind
the times too, my dear. No one dreams of reading this kind of
thing now&mdash;antiquated problem plays, harrowing descriptions of
life in the east end&mdash;oh, no, we've exploded all that. Read poetry,
Rachel, poetry, poetry, poetry!"</p>

<p>Picking up one of the books, he began to read aloud, his intention
being to satirise the short sharp bark of the writer's English;
but she paid no attention, and after an interval of meditation
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Does it ever seem to you, Terence, that the world is composed
entirely of vast blocks of matter, and that we're nothing but
patches of light&mdash;" she looked at the soft spots of sun wavering
over the carpet and up the wall&mdash;"like that?"</p>

<p>"No," said Terence, "I feel solid; immensely solid; the legs
of my chair might be rooted in the bowels of the earth. But at
Cambridge, I can remember, there were times when one fell into
ridiculous states of semi-coma about five o'clock in the morning.
Hirst does now, I expect&mdash;oh, no, Hirst wouldn't."</p>

<p>Rachel continued, "The day your note came, asking us to go on
the picnic, I was sitting where you're sitting now, thinking that;
I wonder if I could think that again? I wonder if the world's
changed? and if so, when it'll stop changing, and which is the
real world?"</p>

<p>"When I first saw you," he began, "I thought you were like a
creature who'd lived all its life among pearls and old bones.
Your hands were wet, d'you remember, and you never said a word
until I gave you a bit of bread, and then you said, 'Human Beings!'"</p>

<p>"And I thought you&mdash;a prig," she recollected. "No; that's not
quite it. There were the ants who stole the tongue, and I thought
you and St. John were like those ants&mdash;very big, very ugly, very
energetic, with all your virtues on your backs. However, when
I talked to you I liked you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You fell in love with me," he corrected her. "You were in love
with me all the time, only you didn't know it."</p>

<p>"No, I never fell in love with you," she asserted.</p>

<p>"Rachel&mdash;what a lie&mdash;didn't you sit here looking at my window&mdash;didn't
you wander about the hotel like an owl in the sun&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No," she repeated, "I never fell in love, if falling in love
is what people say it is, and it's the world that tells the lies
and I tell the truth. Oh, what lies&mdash;what lies!"</p>

<p>She crumpled together a handful of letters from Evelyn M., from
Mr. Pepper, from Mrs. Thornbury and Miss Allan, and Susan Warrington.
It was strange, considering how very different these people were,
that they used almost the same sentences when they wrote to congratulate
her upon her engagement.</p>

<p>That any one of these people had ever felt what she felt, or
could ever feel it, or had even the right to pretend for a single
second that they were capable of feeling it, appalled her much
as the church service had done, much as the face of the hospital
nurse had done; and if they didn't feel a thing why did they go
and pretend to? The simplicity and arrogance and hardness of her
youth, now concentrated into a single spark as it was by her love
of him, puzzled Terence; being engaged had not that effect on
him; the world was different, but not in that way; he still wanted
the things he had always wanted, and in particular he wanted the
companionship of other people more than ever perhaps. He took
the letters out of her hand, and protested:</p>

<p>"Of course they're absurd, Rachel; of course they say things
just because other people say them, but even so, what a nice woman
Miss Allan is; you can't deny that; and Mrs. Thornbury too; she's
got too many children I grant you, but if half-a-dozen of them
had gone to the bad instead of rising infallibly to the tops of
their trees&mdash;hasn't she a kind of beauty&mdash;of elemental simplicity
as Flushing would say? Isn't she rather like a large old tree
murmuring in the moonlight, or a river going on and on and on?
By the way, Ralph's been made governor of the Carroway Islands&mdash;the
youngest governor in the service; very good, isn't it?"</p>

<p>But Rachel was at present unable to conceive that the vast majority
of the affairs of the world went on unconnected by a single thread
with her own destiny.</p>

<p>"I won't have eleven children," she asserted; "I won't have the
eyes of an old woman. She looks at one up and down, up and down,
as if one were a horse."</p>

<p>"We must have a son and we must have a daughter," said Terence,
putting down the letters, "because, let alone the inestimable
advantage of being our children, they'd be so well brought up."
They went on to sketch an outline of the ideal education&mdash;how
their daughter should be required from infancy to gaze at a large
square of cardboard painted blue, to suggest thoughts of infinity,
for women were grown too practical; and their son&mdash;he should be
taught to laugh at great men, that is, at distinguished successful
men, at men who wore ribands and rose to the tops of their trees.
He should in no way resemble (Rachel added) St. John Hirst.</p>

<p>At this Terence professed the greatest admiration for St. John
Hirst. Dwelling upon his good qualities he became seriously convinced
of them; he had a mind like a torpedo, he declared, aimed at falsehood.
Where should we all be without him and his like? Choked in weeds;
Christians, bigots,&mdash;why, Rachel herself, would be a slave with
a fan to sing songs to men when they felt drowsy.</p>

<p>"But you'll never see it!" he exclaimed; "because with all your
virtues you don't, and you never will, care with every fibre of
your being for the pursuit of truth! You've no respect for facts,
Rachel; you're essentially feminine." She did not trouble to deny
it, nor did she think good to produce the one unanswerable argument
against the merits which Terence admired. St. John Hirst said
that she was in love with him; she would never forgive that; but
the argument was not one to appeal to a man.</p>

<p>"But I like him," she said, and she thought to herself that she
also pitied him, as one pities those unfortunate people who are
outside the warm mysterious globe full of changes and miracles
in which we ourselves move about; she thought that it must be
very dull to be St. John Hirst.</p>

<p>She summed up what she felt about him by saying that she would
not kiss him supposing he wished it, which was not likely.</p>

<p>As if some apology were due to Hirst for the kiss which she then
bestowed upon him, Terence protested:</p>

<p>"And compared with Hirst I'm a perfect Zany."</p>

<p>The clock here struck twelve instead of eleven.</p>

<p>"We're wasting the morning &mdash;I ought to be writing my book,
and you ought to be answering these."</p>

<p>"We've only got twenty-one whole mornings left," said Rachel.
"And my father'll be here in a day or two."</p>

<p>However, she drew a pen and paper towards her and began to write
laboriously,</p>

<p>"My dear Evelyn&mdash;"</p>

<p>Terence, meanwhile, read a novel which some one else had written,
a process which he found essential to the composition of his own.
For a considerable time nothing was to be heard but the ticking
of the clock and the fitful scratch of Rachel's pen, as she produced
phrases which bore a considerable likeness to those which she
had condemned. She was struck by it herself, for she stopped writing
and looked up; looked at Terence deep in the arm-chair, looked
at the different pieces of furniture, at her bed in the corner,
at the window-pane which showed the branches of a tree filled
in with sky, heard the clock ticking, and was amazed at the gulf
which lay between all that and her sheet of paper. Would there
ever be a time when the world was one and indivisible? Even with
Terence himself&mdash;how far apart they could be, how little she knew
what was passing in his brain now! She then finished her sentence,
which was awkward and ugly, and stated that they were "both very
happy, and going to be married in the autumn probably and hope
to live in London, where we hope you will come and see us when
we get back." Choosing "affectionately," after some further speculation,
rather than sincerely, she signed the letter and was doggedly
beginning on another when Terence remarked, quoting from his book:</p>

<p>"Listen to this, Rachel. 'It is probable that Hugh' (he's the
hero, a literary man), 'had not realised at the time of his marriage,
any more than the young man of parts and imagination usually does
realise, the nature of the gulf which separates the needs and
desires of the male from the needs and desires of the female.
. . . At first they had been very happy. The walking tour in Switzerland
had been a time of jolly companionship and stimulating revelations
for both of them. Betty had proved herself the ideal comrade.
. . . They had shouted <em>Love</em> <em>in</em> <em>the</em>
<em>Valley</em> to each other across the snowy slopes of the Riffelhorn'
(and so on, and so on &mdash;I'll skip the descriptions). . .
. 'But in London, after the boy's birth, all was changed. Betty
was an admirable mother; but it did not take her long to find
out that motherhood, as that function is understood by the mother
of the upper middle classes, did not absorb the whole of her energies.
She was young and strong, with healthy limbs and a body and brain
that called urgently for exercise. . . .' (In short she began
to give tea-parties.) . . . 'Coming in late from this singular
talk with old Bob Murphy in his smoky, book-lined room, where
the two men had each unloosened his soul to the other, with the
sound of the traffic humming in his ears, and the foggy London
sky slung tragically across his mind . . . he found women's hats
dotted about among his papers. Women's wraps and absurd little
feminine shoes and umbrellas were in the hall. . . . Then the
bills began to come in. . . . He tried to speak frankly to her.
He found her lying on the great polar-bear skin in their bedroom,
half-undressed, for they were dining with the Greens in Wilton
Crescent, the ruddy firelight making the diamonds wink and twinkle
on her bare arms and in the delicious curve of her breast&mdash;a vision
of adorable femininity. He forgave her all.' (Well, this goes
from bad to worse, and finally about fifty pages later, Hugh takes
a week-end ticket to Swanage and 'has it out with himself on the
downs above Corfe.' . . . Here there's fifteen pages or so which
we'll skip. The conclusion is . . .) 'They were different. Perhaps,
in the far future, when generations of men had struggled and failed
as he must now struggle and fail, woman would be, indeed, what
she now made a pretence of being&mdash;the friend and companion&mdash;not
the enemy and parasite of man.'</p>

<p>"The end of it is, you see, Hugh went back to his wife, poor
fellow. It was his duty, as a married man. Lord, Rachel," he concluded,
"will it be like that when we're married?"</p>

<p>Instead of answering him she asked,</p>

<p>"Why don't people write about the things they do feel?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's the difficulty!" he sighed, tossing the book away.</p>

<p>"Well, then, what will it be like when we're married? What are
the things people do feel?"</p>

<p>She seemed doubtful.</p>

<p>"Sit on the floor and let me look at you," he commanded. Resting
her chin on his knee, she looked straight at him.</p>

<p>He examined her curiously.</p>

<p>"You're not beautiful," he began, "but I like your face. I like
the way your hair grows down in a point, and your eyes too&mdash;they
never see anything. Your mouth's too big, and your cheeks would
be better if they had more colour in them. But what I like about
your face is that it makes one wonder what the devil you're thinking
about&mdash;it makes me want to do that&mdash;" He clenched his fist and
shook it so near her that she started back, "because now you look
as if you'd blow my brains out. There are moments," he continued,
"when, if we stood on a rock together, you'd throw me into the
sea."</p>

<p>Hypnotised by the force of his eyes in hers, she repeated, "If
we stood on a rock together&mdash;"</p>

<p>To be flung into the sea, to be washed hither and thither, and
driven about the roots of the world&mdash;the idea was incoherently
delightful. She sprang up, and began moving about the room, bending
and thrusting aside the chairs and tables as if she were indeed
striking through the waters. He watched her with pleasure; she
seemed to be cleaving a passage for herself, and dealing triumphantly
with the obstacles which would hinder their passage through life.</p>

<p>"It does seem possible!" he exclaimed, "though I've always thought
it the most unlikely thing in the world &mdash;I shall be in love
with you all my life, and our marriage will be the most exciting
thing that's ever been done! We'll never have a moment's peace&mdash;"
He caught her in his arms as she passed him, and they fought for
mastery, imagining a rock, and the sea heaving beneath them. At
last she was thrown to the floor, where she lay gasping, and crying
for mercy.</p>

<p>"I'm a mermaid! I can swim," she cried, "so the game's up." Her
dress was torn across, and peace being established, she fetched
a needle and thread and began to mend the tear.</p>

<p>"And now," she said, "be quiet and tell me about the world; tell
me about everything that's ever happened, and I'll tell you&mdash;let
me see, what can I tell you? &mdash;I'll tell you about Miss Montgomerie
and the river party. She was left, you see, with one foot in the
boat, and the other on shore."</p>

<p>They had spent much time already in thus filling out for the
other the course of their past lives, and the characters of their
friends and relations, so that very soon Terence knew not only
what Rachel's aunts might be expected to say upon every occasion,
but also how their bedrooms were furnished, and what kind of bonnets
they wore. He could sustain a conversation between Mrs. Hunt and
Rachel, and carry on a tea-party including the Rev. William Johnson
and Miss Macquoid, the Christian Scientists, with remarkable likeness
to the truth. But he had known many more people, and was far more
highly skilled in the art of narrative than Rachel was, whose
experiences were, for the most part, of a curiously childlike
and humorous kind, so that it generally fell to her lot to listen
and ask questions.</p>

<p>He told her not only what had happened, but what he had thought
and felt, and sketched for her portraits which fascinated her
of what other men and women might be supposed to be thinking and
feeling, so that she became very anxious to go back to England,
which was full of people, where she could merely stand in the
streets and look at them. According to him, too, there was an
order, a pattern which made life reasonable, or if that word was
foolish, made it of deep interest anyhow, for sometimes it seemed
possible to understand why things happened as they did. Nor were
people so solitary and uncommunicative as she believed. She should
look for vanity&mdash;for vanity was a common quality&mdash;first in herself,
and then in Helen, in Ridley, in St. John, they all had their
share of it&mdash;and she would find it in ten people out of every
twelve she met; and once linked together by one such tie she would
find them not separate and formidable, but practically indistinguishable,
and she would come to love them when she found that they were
like herself.</p>

<p>If she denied this, she must defend her belief that human beings
were as various as the beasts at the Zoo, which had stripes and
manes, and horns and humps; and so, wrestling over the entire
list of their acquaintances, and diverging into anecdote and theory
and speculation, they came to know each other. The hours passed
quickly, and seemed to them full to leaking-point. After a night's
solitude they were always ready to begin again.</p>

<p>The virtues which Mrs. Ambrose had once believed to exist in
free talk between men and women did in truth exist for both of
them, although not quite in the measure she prescribed. Far more
than upon the nature of sex they dwelt upon the nature of poetry,
but it was true that talk which had no boundaries deepened and
enlarged the strangely small bright view of a girl. In return
for what he could tell her she brought him such curiosity and
sensitiveness of perception, that he was led to doubt whether
any gift bestowed by much reading and living was quite the equal
of that for pleasure and pain. What would experience give her
after all, except a kind of ridiculous formal balance, like that
of a drilled dog in the street? He looked at her face and wondered
how it would look in twenty years' time, when the eyes had dulled,
and the forehead wore those little persistent wrinkles which seem
to show that the middle-aged are facing something hard which the
young do not see? What would the hard thing be for them, he wondered?
Then his thoughts turned to their life in England.</p>

<p>The thought of England was delightful, for together they would
see the old things freshly; it would be England in June, and there
would be June nights in the country; and the nightingales singing
in the lanes, into which they could steal when the room grew hot;
and there would be English meadows gleaming with water and set
with stolid cows, and clouds dipping low and trailing across the
green hills. As he sat in the room with her, he wished very often
to be back again in the thick of life, doing things with Rachel.</p>

<p>He crossed to the window and exclaimed, "Lord, how good it is
to think of lanes, muddy lanes, with brambles and nettles, you
know, and real grass fields, and farmyards with pigs and cows,
and men walking beside carts with pitchforks&mdash;there's nothing
to compare with that here&mdash;look at the stony red earth, and the
bright blue sea, and the glaring white houses&mdash;how tired one gets
of it! And the air, without a stain or a wrinkle. I'd give anything
for a sea mist."</p>

<p>Rachel, too, had been thinking of the English country: the flat
land rolling away to the sea, and the woods and the long straight
roads, where one can walk for miles without seeing any one, and
the great church towers and the curious houses clustered in the
valleys, and the birds, and the dusk, and the rain falling against
the windows.</p>

<p>"But London, London's the place," Terence continued. They looked
together at the carpet, as though London itself were to be seen
there lying on the floor, with all its spires and pinnacles pricking
through the smoke.</p>

<p>"On the whole, what I should like best at this moment," Terence
pondered, "would be to find myself walking down Kingsway, by those
big placards, you know, and turning into the Strand. Perhaps I
might go and look over Waterloo Bridge for a moment. Then I'd
go along the Strand past the shops with all the new books in them,
and through the little archway into the Temple. I always like
the quiet after the uproar. You hear your own footsteps suddenly
quite loud. The Temple's very pleasant. I think I should go and
see if I could find dear old Hodgkin&mdash;the man who writes books
about Van Eyck, you know. When I left England he was very sad
about his tame magpie. He suspected that a man had poisoned it.
And then Russell lives on the next staircase. I think you'd like
him. He's a passion for Handel. Well, Rachel," he concluded, dismissing
the vision of London, "we shall be doing that together in six
weeks' time, and it'll be the middle of June then&mdash;and June in
London&mdash;my God! how pleasant it all is!"</p>

<p>"And we're certain to have it too," she said. "It isn't as if
we were expecting a great deal&mdash;only to walk about and look at
things."</p>

<p>"Only a thousand a year and perfect freedom," he replied. "How
many people in London d'you think have that?"</p>

<p>"And now you've spoilt it," she complained. "Now we've got to
think of the horrors." She looked grudgingly at the novel which
had once caused her perhaps an hour's discomfort, so that she
had never opened it again, but kept it on her table, and looked
at it occasionally, as some medieval monk kept a skull, or a crucifix
to remind him of the frailty of the body.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Terence," she demanded, "that women die with bugs
crawling across their faces?"</p>

<p>"I think it's very probable," he said. "But you must admit, Rachel,
that we so seldom think of anything but ourselves that an occasional
twinge is really rather pleasant."</p>

<p>Accusing him of an affection of cynicism which was just as bad
as sentimentality itself, she left her position by his side and
knelt upon the window sill, twisting the curtain tassels between
her fingers. A vague sense of dissatisfaction filled her.</p>

<p>"What's so detestable in this country," she exclaimed, "is the
blue&mdash;always blue sky and blue sea. It's like a curtain&mdash;all the
things one wants are on the other side of that. I want to know
what's going on behind it. I hate these divisions, don't you,
Terence? One person all in the dark about another person. Now
I liked the Dalloways," she continued, "and they're gone. I shall
never see them again. Just by going on a ship we cut ourselves
off entirely from the rest of the world. I want to see England
there &mdash;London there&mdash;all sorts of people&mdash;why shouldn't
one? why should one be shut up all by oneself in a room?"</p>

<p>While she spoke thus half to herself and with increasing vagueness,
because her eye was caught by a ship that had just come into the
bay, she did not see that Terence had ceased to stare contentedly
in front of him, and was looking at her keenly and with dissatisfaction.
She seemed to be able to cut herself adrift from him, and to pass
away to unknown places where she had no need of him. The thought
roused his jealousy.</p>

<p>"I sometimes think you're not in love with me and never will
be," he said energetically. She started and turned round at his
words.</p>

<p>"I don't satisfy you in the way you satisfy me," he continued.
"There's something I can't get hold of in you. You don't want
me as I want you&mdash;you're always wanting something else."</p>

<p>He began pacing up and down the room.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I ask too much," he went on. "Perhaps it isn't really
possible to have what I want. Men and women are too different.
You can't understand&mdash;you don't understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>He came up to where she stood looking at him in silence.</p>

<p>It seemed to her now that what he was saying was perfectly true,
and that she wanted many more things than the love of one human
being&mdash;the sea, the sky. She turned again the looked at the distant
blue, which was so smooth and serene where the sky met the sea;
she could not possibly want only one human being.</p>

<p>"Or is it only this damnable engagement?" he continued. "Let's
be married here, before we go back&mdash;or is it too great a risk?
Are we sure we want to marry each other?"</p>

<p>They began pacing up and down the room, but although they came
very near each other in their pacing, they took care not to touch
each other. The hopelessness of their position overcame them both.
They were impotent; they could never love each other sufficiently
to overcome all these barriers, and they could never be satisfied
with less. Realising this with intolerable keenness she stopped
in front of him and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Let's break it off, then."</p>

<p>The words did more to unite them than any amount of argument.
As if they stood on the edge of a precipice they clung together.
They knew that they could not separate; painful and terrible it
might be, but they were joined for ever. They lapsed into silence,
and after a time crept together in silence. Merely to be so close
soothed them, and sitting side by side the divisions disappeared,
and it seemed as if the world were once more solid and entire,
and as if, in some strange way, they had grown larger and stronger.</p>

<p>It was long before they moved, and when they moved it was with
great reluctance. They stood together in front of the looking-glass,
and with a brush tried to make themselves look as if they had
been feeling nothing all the morning, neither pain nor happiness.
But it chilled them to see themselves in the glass, for instead
of being vast and indivisible they were really very small and
