<p>"It was the writing on his forehead," said Babalatchi, adding
a couple of small sticks to the little fire by which he was squatting,
and without looking at Lakamba who lay down supported on his elbow
on the other side of the embers. "It was written when he was born
that he should end his life in darkness, and now he is like a
man walking in a black night&mdash;with his eyes open, yet seeing not.
I knew him well when he had slaves, and many wives, and much merchandise,
and trading praus, and praus for fighting. Hai&mdash;ya! He was a great
fighter in the days before the breath of the Merciful put out
the light in his eyes. He was a pilgrim, and had many virtues:
he was brave, his hand was open, and he was a great robber. For
many years he led the men that drank blood on the sea: first in
prayer and first in fight! Have I not stood behind him when his
face was turned to the West? Have I not watched by his side ships
with high masts burning in a straight flame on the calm water?
Have I not followed him on dark nights amongst sleeping men that
woke up only to die? His sword was swifter than the fire from
Heaven, and struck before it flashed. Hai! Tuan! Those were the
days and that was a leader, and I myself was younger; and in those
days there were not so many fireships with guns that deal fiery
death from afar. Over the hill and over the forest &mdash;O! Tuan
Lakamba! they dropped whistling fireballs into the creek where
our praus took refuge, and where they dared not follow men who
had arms in their hands."</p>

<p>He shook his head with mournful regret and threw another handful
of fuel on the fire. The burst of clear flame lit up his broad,
dark, and pock-marked face, where the big lips, stained with betel-juice,
looked like a deep and bleeding gash of a fresh wound. The reflection
of the firelight gleamed brightly in his solitary eye, lending
it for a moment a fierce animation that died out together with
the short-lived flame. With quick touches of his bare hands he
raked the embers into a heap, then, wiping the warm ash on his
waistcloth&mdash;his only garment&mdash;he clasped his thin legs with his
entwined fingers, and rested his chin on his drawn-up knees. Lakamba
stirred slightly without changing his position or taking his eyes
off the glowing coals, on which they had been fixed in dreamy
immobility.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Babalatchi, in a low monotone, as if pursuing
aloud a train of thought that had its beginning in the silent
contemplation of the unstable nature of earthly greatness&mdash;"yes.
He has been rich and strong, and now he lives on alms: old, feeble,
blind, and without companions, but for his daughter. The Rajah
Patalolo gives him rice, and the pale woman&mdash;his daughter&mdash;cooks
it for him, for he has no slave."</p>

<p>"I saw her from afar," muttered Lakamba, disparagingly. "A she-dog
with white teeth, like a woman of the Orang-Putih."</p>

<p>"Right, right," assented Babalatchi; "but you have not seen her
near. Her mother was a woman from the west; a Baghdadi woman with
veiled face. Now she goes uncovered, like our women do, for she
is poor and he is blind, and nobody ever comes near them unless
to ask for a charm or a blessing and depart quickly for fear of
his anger and of the Rajah’s hand. You have not been on that side
of the river?"</p>

<p>"Not for a long time. If I go . . ."</p>

<p>"True! true!" interrupted Babalatchi, soothingly, "but I go often
alone&mdash;for your good&mdash;and look&mdash;and listen. When the time comes;
when we both go together towards the Rajah’s campong, it will
be to enter&mdash;and to remain."</p>

<p>Lakamba sat up and looked at Babalatchi gloomily.</p>

<p>"This is good talk, once, twice; when it is heard too often it
becomes foolish, like the prattle of children."</p>

<p>"Many, many times have I seen the cloudy sky and have heard the
wind of the rainy seasons," said Babalatchi, impressively.</p>

<p>"And where is your wisdom? It must be with the wind and the clouds
of seasons past, for I do not hear it in your talk."</p>

<p>"Those are the words of the ungrateful!" shouted Babalatchi,
with sudden exasperation. "Verily, our only refuge is with the
One, the Mighty, the Redresser of . . ."</p>

<p>"Peace! Peace!" growled the startled Lakamba. "It is but a friend’s
talk."</p>

<p>Babalatchi subsided into his former attitude, muttering to himself.
After awhile he went on again in a louder voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since the Rajah Laut left another white man here in Sambir,
the daughter of the blind Omar el Badavi has spoken to other ears
than mine."</p>

<p>"Would a white man listen to a beggar’s daughter?" said Lakamba,
doubtingly.</p>

<p>"Hai! I have seen . . ."</p>

<p>"And what did you see? O one-eyed one!" exclaimed Lakamba, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"I have seen the strange white man walking on the narrow path
before the sun could dry the drops of dew on the bushes, and I
have heard the whisper of his voice when he spoke through the
smoke of the morning fire to that woman with big eyes and a pale
skin. Woman in body, but in heart a man! She knows no fear and
no shame. I have heard her voice too."</p>

<p>He nodded twice at Lakamba sagaciously and gave himself up to
silent musing, his solitary eye fixed immovably upon the straight
wall of forest on the opposite bank. Lakamba lay silent, staring
vacantly. Under them Lingard’s own river rippled softly amongst
the piles supporting the bamboo platform of the little watch-house
before which they were lying. Behind the house the ground rose
in a gentle swell of a low hill cleared of the big timber, but
thickly overgrown with the grass and bushes, now withered and
burnt up in the long drought of the dry season. This old rice
clearing, which had been several years lying fallow, was framed
on three sides by the impenetrable and tangled growth of the untouched
forest, and on the fourth came down to the muddy river bank. There
was not a breath of wind on the land or river, but high above,
in the transparent sky, little clouds rushed past the moon, now
appearing in her diffused rays with the brilliance of silver,
now obscuring her face with the blackness of ebony. Far away,
in the middle of the river, a fish would leap now and then with
a short splash, the very loudness of which measured the profundity
of the overpowering silence that swallowed up the sharp sound
suddenly.</p>

<p>Lakamba dozed uneasily off, but the wakeful Babalatchi sat thinking
deeply, sighing from time to time, and slapping himself over his
naked torso incessantly in a vain endeavour to keep off an occasional
and wandering mosquito that, rising as high as the platform above
the swarms of the riverside, would settle with a ping of triumph
on the unexpected victim. The moon, pursuing her silent and toilsome
path, attained her highest elevation, and chasing the shadow of
the roof-eaves from Lakamba’s face, seemed to hang arrested over
their heads. Babalatchi revived the fire and woke up his companion,
who sat up yawning and shivering discontentedly.</p>

<p>Babalatchi spoke again in a voice which was like the murmur of
a brook that runs over the stones: low, monotonous, persistent;
irresistible in its power to wear out and to destroy the hardest
obstacles. Lakamba listened, silent but interested. They were
Malay adventurers; ambitious men of that place and time; the Bohemians
of their race. In the early days of the settlement, before the
ruler Patalolo had shaken off his allegiance to the Sultan of
Koti, Lakamba appeared in the river with two small trading vessels.
He was disappointed to find already some semblance of organization
amongst the settlers of various races who recognized the unobtrusive
sway of old Patalolo, and he was not politic enough to conceal
his disappointment. He declared himself to be a man from the east,
from those parts where no white man ruled, and to be of an oppressed
race, but of a princely family. And truly enough he had all the
gifts of an exiled prince. He was discontented, ungrateful, turbulent;
a man full of envy and ready for intrigue, with brave words and
empty promises for ever on his lips. He was obstinate, but his
will was made up of short impulses that never lasted long enough
to carry him to the goal of his ambition. Received coldly by the
suspicious Patalolo, he persisted&mdash;permission or no permission&mdash;in
clearing the ground on a good spot some fourteen miles down the
river from Sambir, and built himself a house there, which he fortified
by a high palisade. As he had many followers and seemed very reckless,
the old Rajah did not think it prudent at the time to interfere
with him by force. Once settled, he began to intrigue. The quarrel
of Patalolo with the Sultan of Koti was of his fomenting, but
failed to produce the result he expected because the Sultan could
not back him up effectively at such a great distance. Disappointed
in that scheme, he promptly organized an outbreak of the Bugis
settlers, and besieged the old Rajah in his stockade with much
noisy valour and a fair chance of success; but Lingard then appeared
on the scene with the armed brig, and the old seaman’s hairy forefinger,
shaken menacingly in his face, quelled his martial ardour. No
man cared to encounter the Rajah Laut, and Lakamba, with momentary
resignation, subsided into a half-cultivator, half-trader, and
nursed in his fortified house his wrath and his ambition, keeping
it for use on a more propitious occasion. Still faithful to his
character of a prince-pretender, he would not recognize the constituted
authorities, answering sulkily the Rajah’s messenger, who claimed
the tribute for the cultivated fields, that the Rajah had better
come and take it himself. By Lingard’s advice he was left alone,
notwithstanding his rebellious mood; and for many days he lived
undisturbed amongst his wives and retainers, cherishing that persistent
and causeless hope of better times, the possession of which seems
to be the universal privilege of exiled greatness.</p>

<p>But the passing days brought no change. The hope grew faint and
the hot ambition burnt itself out, leaving only a feeble and expiring
spark amongst a heap of dull and tepid ashes of indolent acquiescence
with the decrees of Fate, till Babalatchi fanned it again into
a bright flame. Babalatchi had blundered upon the river while
in search of a safe refuge for his disreputable head.</p>

<p>He was a vagabond of the seas, a true Orang-Laut, living by rapine
and plunder of coasts and ships in his prosperous days; earning
his living by honest and irksome toil when the days of adversity
were upon him. So, although at times leading the Sulu rovers,
he had also served as Serang of country ships, and in that wise
had visited the distant seas, beheld the glories of Bombay, the
might of the Mascati Sultan; had even struggled in a pious throng
for the privilege of touching with his lips the Sacred Stone of
the Holy City. He gathered experience and wisdom in many lands,
and after attaching himself to Omar el Badavi, he affected great
piety (as became a pilgrim), although unable to read the inspired
words of the Prophet. He was brave and bloodthirsty without any
affection, and he hated the white men who interfered with the
manly pursuits of throat-cutting, kidnapping, slave-dealing, and
fire-raising, that were the only possible occupation for a true
man of the sea. He found favour in the eyes of his chief, the
fearless Omar el Badavi, the leader of Brunei rovers, whom he
followed with unquestioning loyalty through the long years of
successful depredation. And when that long career of murder, robbery
and violence received its first serious check at the hands of
white men, he stood faithfully by his chief, looked steadily at
the bursting shells, was undismayed by the flames of the burning
stronghold, by the death of his companions, by the shrieks of
their women, the wailing of their children; by the sudden ruin
and destruction of all that he deemed indispensable to a happy
and glorious existence. The beaten ground between the houses was
slippery with blood, and the dark mangroves of the muddy creeks
were full of sighs of the dying men who were stricken down before
they could see their enemy. They died helplessly, for into the
tangled forest there was no escape, and their swift praus, in
which they had so often scoured the coast and the seas, now wedged
together in the narrow creek, were burning fiercely. Babalatchi,
with the clear perception of the coming end, devoted all his energies
to saving if it was but only one of them. He succeeded in time.
When the end came in the explosion of the stored powder-barrels,
he was ready to look for his chief. He found him half dead and
totally blinded, with nobody near him but his daughter Aissa:&mdash;the
sons had fallen earlier in the day, as became men of their courage.
Helped by the girl with the steadfast heart, Babalatchi carried
Omar on board the light prau and succeeded in escaping, but with
very few companions only. As they hauled their craft into the
network of dark and silent creeks, they could hear the cheering
of the crews of the man-of-war’s boats dashing to the attack of
the rover’s village. Aissa, sitting on the high after-deck, her
father’s blackened and bleeding head in her lap, looked up with
fearless eyes at Babalatchi. "They shall find only smoke, blood
and dead men, and women mad with fear there, but nothing else
living,"  she said, mournfully. Babalatchi, pressing with his
right hand the deep gash on his shoulder, answered sadly: "They
are very strong. When we fight with them we can only die. Yet,"
he added, menacingly&mdash;"some of us still live! Some of us still
live!"</p>

<p>For a short time he dreamed of vengeance, but his dream was dispelled
by the cold reception of the Sultan of Sulu, with whom they sought
refuge at first and who gave them only a contemptuous and grudging
hospitality. While Omar, nursed by Aissa, was recovering from
his wounds, Babalatchi attended industriously before the exalted
Presence that had extended to them the hand of Protection. For
all that, when Babalatchi spoke into the Sultan’s ear certain
proposals of a great and profitable raid, that was to sweep the
islands from Ternate to Acheen, the Sultan was very angry. "I
know you, you men from the west," he exclaimed, angrily. "Your
words are poison in a Ruler’s ears. Your talk is of fire and murder
and booty&mdash;but on our heads falls the vengeance of the blood you
drink. Begone!"</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done. Times were changed. So changed
that, when a Spanish frigate appeared before the island and a
demand was sent to the Sultan to deliver Omar and his companions,
Babalatchi was not surprised to hear that they were going to be
made the victims of political expediency. But from that sane appreciation
of danger to tame submission was a very long step. And then began
Omar’s second flight. It began arms in hand, for the little band
had to fight in the night on the beach for the possession of the
small canoes in which those that survived got away at last. The
story of that escape lives in the hearts of brave men even to
this day. They talk of Babalatchi and of the strong woman who
carried her blind father through the surf under the fire of the
warship from the north. The companions of that piratical and son-less
Aeneas are dead now, but their ghosts wander over the waters and
the islands at night&mdash;after the manner of ghosts&mdash;and haunt the
fires by which sit armed men, as is meet for the spirits of fearless
warriors who died in battle. There they may hear the story of
their own deeds, of their own courage, suffering and death, on
the lips of living men. That story is told in many places. On
the cool mats in breezy verandahs of Rajahs’ houses it is alluded
to disdainfully by impassive statesmen, but amongst armed men
that throng the courtyards it is a tale which stills the murmur
of voices and the tinkle of anklets; arrests the passage of the
siri-vessel, and fixes the eyes in absorbed gaze. They talk of
the fight, of the fearless woman, of the wise man; of long suffering
on the thirsty sea in leaky canoes; of those who died. . . . Many
died. A few survived. The chief, the woman, and another one who
became great.</p>

<p>There was no hint of incipient greatness in Babalatchi’s unostentatious
arrival in Sambir. He came with Omar and Aissa in a small prau
loaded with green cocoanuts, and claimed the ownership of both
vessel and cargo. How it came to pass that Babalatchi, fleeing
for his life in a small canoe, managed to end his hazardous journey
in a vessel full of a valuable commodity, is one of those secrets
of the sea that baffle the most searching inquiry. In truth nobody
inquired much. There were rumours of a missing trading prau belonging
to Menado, but they were vague and remained mysterious. Babalatchi
told a story which&mdash;it must be said in justice to Patalolo’s knowledge
of the world&mdash;was not believed. When the Rajah ventured to state
his doubts, Babalatchi asked him in tones of calm remonstrance
whether he could reasonably suppose that two oldish men&mdash;who had
only one eye amongst them&mdash;and a young woman were likely to gain
possession of anything whatever by violence? Charity was a virtue
recommended by the Prophet. There were charitable people, and
their hand was open to the deserving. Patalolo wagged his aged
head doubtingly, and Babalatchi withdrew with a shocked mien and
put himself forthwith under Lakamba’s protection. The two men
who completed the prau’s crew followed him into that magnate’s
campong. The blind Omar, with Aissa, remained under the care of
the Rajah, and the Rajah confiscated the cargo. The prau hauled
up on the mud-bank, at the junction of the two branches of the
Pantai, rotted in the rain, warped in the sun, fell to pieces
and gradually vanished into the smoke of household fires of the
settlement. Only a forgotten plank and a rib or two, sticking
neglected in the shiny ooze for a long time, served to remind
Babalatchi during many months that he was a stranger in the land.</p>

<p>Otherwise, he felt perfectly at home in Lakamba’s establishment,
where his peculiar position and influence were quickly recognized
and soon submitted to even by the women. He had all a true vagabond’s
pliability to circumstances and adaptiveness to momentary surroundings.
In his readiness to learn from experience that contempt for early
principles so necessary to a true statesman, he equalled the most
successful politicians of any age; and he had enough persuasiveness
and firmness of purpose to acquire a complete mastery over Lakamba’s
vacillating mind&mdash;where there was nothing stable but an all-pervading
discontent. He kept the discontent alive, he rekindled the expiring
ambition, he moderated the poor exile’s not unnatural impatience
to attain a high and lucrative position. He&mdash;the man of violence&mdash;deprecated
the use of force, for he had a clear comprehension of the difficult
situation. From the same cause, he&mdash;the hater of white men&mdash;would
to some extent admit the eventual expediency of Dutch protection.
But nothing should be done in a hurry. Whatever his master Lakamba
might think, there was no use in poisoning old Patalolo, he maintained.
It could be done, of course; but what then? As long as Lingard’s
influence was paramount&mdash;as long as Almayer, Lingard’s representative,
was the only great trader of the settlement, it was not worth
Lakamba’s while&mdash;even if it had been possible&mdash;to grasp the rule
of the young state. Killing Almayer and Lingard was so difficult
and so risky that it might be dismissed as impracticable. What
was wanted was an alliance; somebody to set up against the white
men’s influence&mdash;and somebody who, while favourable to Lakamba,
would at the same time be a person of a good standing with the
Dutch authorities. A rich and considered trader was wanted. Such
a person once firmly established in Sambir would help them to
oust the old Rajah, to remove him from power or from life if there
was no other way. Then it would be time to apply to the Orang
Blanda for a flag; for a recognition of their meritorious services;
for that protection which would make them safe for ever! The word
of a rich and loyal trader would mean something with the Ruler
down in Batavia. The first thing to do was to find such an ally
and to induce him to settle in Sambir. A white trader would not
do. A white man would not fall in with their ideas&mdash;would not
be trustworthy. The man they wanted should be rich, unscrupulous,
have many followers, and be a well-known personality in the islands.
Such a man might be found amongst the Arab traders. Lingard’s
jealousy, said Babalatchi, kept all the traders out of the river.
Some were afraid, and some did not know how to get there; others
ignored the very existence of Sambir; a good many did not think
it worth their while to run the risk of Lingard’s enmity for the
doubtful advantage of trade with a comparatively unknown settlement.
The great majority were undesirable or untrustworthy. And Babalatchi
mentioned regretfully the men he had known in his young days:
wealthy, resolute, courageous, reckless, ready for any enterprise!
But why lament the past and speak about the dead? There is one
man&mdash;living&mdash;great&mdash;not far off . . .</p>

<p>Such was Babalatchi’s line of policy laid before his ambitious
protector. Lakamba assented, his only objection being that it
was very slow work. In his extreme desire to grasp dollars and
power, the unintellectual exile was ready to throw himself into
the arms of any wandering cut-throat whose help could be secured,
and Babalatchi experienced great difficulty in restraining him
from unconsidered violence. It would not do to let it be seen
that they had any hand in introducing a new element into the social
and political life of Sambir. There was always a possibility of
failure, and in that case Lingard’s vengeance would be swift and
certain. No risk should be run. They must wait.</p>

<p>Meantime he pervaded the settlement, squatting in the course
of each day by many household fires, testing the public temper
and public opinion&mdash;and always talking about his impending departure.</p>

<p>At night he would often take Lakamba’s smallest canoe and depart
silently to pay mysterious visits to his old chief on the other
side of the river. Omar lived in odour of sanctity under the wing
of Patalolo. Between the bamboo fence, enclosing the houses of
the Rajah, and the wild forest, there was a banana plantation,
and on its further edge stood two little houses built on low piles
under a few precious fruit trees that grew on the banks of a clear
brook, which, bubbling up behind the house, ran in its short and
rapid course down to the big river. Along the brook a narrow path
led through the dense second growth of a neglected clearing to
the banana plantation and to the houses in it which the Rajah
had given for residence to Omar. The Rajah was greatly impressed
by Omar’s ostentatious piety, by his oracular wisdom, by his many
misfortunes, by the solemn fortitude with which he bore his affliction.
Often the old ruler of Sambir would visit informally the blind
Arab and listen gravely to his talk during the hot hours of an
afternoon. In the night, Babalatchi would call and interrupt Omar’s
repose, unrebuked. Aissa, standing silently at the door of one
of the huts, could see the two old friends as they sat very still
by the fire in the middle of the beaten ground between the two
houses, talking in an indistinct murmur far into the night. She
could not hear their words, but she watched the two formless shadows
curiously. Finally Babalatchi would rise and, taking her father
by the wrist, would lead him back to the house, arrange his mats
for him, and go out quietly. Instead of going away, Babalatchi,
unconscious of Aissa’s eyes, often sat again by the fire, in a
long and deep meditation. Aissa looked with respect on that wise
and brave man&mdash;she was accustomed to see at her father’s side
as long as she could remember&mdash;sitting alone and thoughtful in
the silent night by the dying fire, his body motionless and his
mind wandering in the land of memories, or&mdash;who knows?&mdash;perhaps
groping for a road in the waste spaces of the uncertain future.</p>

<p>Babalatchi noted the arrival of Willems with alarm at this new
accession to the white men’s strength. Afterwards he changed his
opinion. He met Willems one night on the path leading to Omar’s
house, and noticed later on, with only a moderate surprise, that
the blind Arab did not seem to be aware of the new white man’s
visits to the neighbourhood of his dwelling. Once, coming unexpectedly
in the daytime, Babalatchi fancied he could see the gleam of a
white jacket in the bushes on the other side of the brook. That
day he watched Aissa pensively as she moved about preparing the
evening rice; but after awhile he went hurriedly away before sunset,
refusing Omar’s hospitable invitation, in the name of Allah, to
share their meal. That same evening he startled Lakamba by announcing
that the time had come at last to make the first move in their
long-deferred game. Lakamba asked excitedly for explanation. Babalatchi
shook his head and pointed to the flitting shadows of moving women
and to the vague forms of men sitting by the evening fires in
the courtyard. Not a word would he speak here, he declared. But
when the whole household was reposing, Babalatchi and Lakamba
passed silent amongst sleeping groups to the riverside, and, taking
a canoe, paddled off stealthily on their way to the dilapidated
guard-hut in the old rice-clearing. There they were safe from
all eyes and ears, and could account, if need be, for their excursion
by the wish to kill a deer, the spot being well known as the drinking-place
of all kinds of game. In the seclusion of its quiet solitude Babalatchi
explained his plan to the attentive Lakamba. His idea was to make
use of Willems for the destruction of Lingard’s influence.</p>

<p>"I know the white men, Tuan," he said, in conclusion. "In many
lands have I seen them; always the slaves of their desires, always
ready to give up their strength and their reason into the hands
of some woman. The fate of the Believers is written by the hand
of the Mighty One, but they who worship many gods are thrown into
the world with smooth foreheads, for any woman’s hand to mark
their destruction there. Let one white man destroy another. The
will of the Most High is that they should be fools. They know
how to keep faith with their enemies, but towards each other they
know only deception. Hai! I have seen! I have seen!"</p>

<p>He stretched himself full length before the fire, and closed
his eye in real or simulated sleep. Lakamba, not quite convinced,
sat for a long time with his gaze riveted on the dull embers.
As the night advanced, a slight white mist rose from the river,
and the declining moon, bowed over the tops of the forest, seemed
to seek the repose of the earth, like a wayward and wandering
lover who returns at last to lay his tired and silent head on
his beloved’s breast.</p>
