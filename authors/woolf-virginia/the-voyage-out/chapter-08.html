<p>The next few months passed away, as many years can pass away,
without definite events, and yet, if suddenly disturbed, it would
be seen that such months or years had a character unlike others.
The three months which had passed had brought them to the beginning
of March. The climate had kept its promise, and the change of
season from winter to spring had made very little difference,
so that Helen, who was sitting in the drawing-room with a pen
in her hand, could keep the windows open though a great fire of
logs burnt on one side of her. Below, the sea was still blue and
the roofs still brown and white, though the day was fading rapidly.
It was dusk in the room, which, large and empty at all times,
now appeared larger and emptier than usual. Her own figure, as
she sat writing with a pad on her knee, shared the general effect
of size and lack of detail, for the flames which ran along the
branches, suddenly devouring little green tufts, burnt intermittently
and sent irregular illuminations across her face and the plaster
walls. There were no pictures on the walls but here and there
boughs laden with heavy-petalled flowers spread widely against
them. Of the books fallen on the bare floor and heaped upon the
large table, it was only possible in this light to trace the outline.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ambrose was writing a very long letter. Beginning "Dear
Bernard," it went on to describe what had been happening in the
Villa San Gervasio during the past three months, as, for instance,
that they had had the British Consul to dinner, and had been taken
over a Spanish man-of-war, and had seen a great many processions
and religious festivals, which were so beautiful that Mrs. Ambrose
couldn't conceive why, if people must have a religion, they didn't
all become Roman Catholics. They had made several expeditions
though none of any length. It was worth coming if only for the
sake of the flowering trees which grew wild quite near the house,
and the amazing colours of sea and earth. The earth, instead of
being brown, was red, purple, green. "You won't believe me," she
added, "there is no colour like it in England." She adopted, indeed,
a condescending tone towards that poor island, which was now advancing
chilly crocuses and nipped violets in nooks, in copses, in cosy
corners, tended by rosy old gardeners in mufflers, who were always
touching their hats and bobbing obsequiously. She went on to deride
the islanders themselves. Rumours of London all in a ferment over
a General Election had reached them even out here. "It seems incredible,"
she went on, "that people should care whether Asquith is in or
Austen Chamberlain out, and while you scream yourselves hoarse
about politics you let the only people who are trying for something
good starve or simply laugh at them. When have you ever encouraged
a living artist? Or bought his best work? Why are you all so ugly
and so servile? Here the servants are human beings. They talk
to one as if they were equals. As far as I can tell there are
no aristocrats."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the mention of aristocrats that reminded her of
Richard Dalloway and Rachel, for she ran on with the same penful
to describe her niece.</p>

<p>"It's an odd fate that has put me in charge of a girl," she wrote,
"considering that I have never got on well with women, or had
much to do with them. However, I must retract some of the things
that I have said against them. If they were properly educated
I don't see why they shouldn't be much the same as men&mdash;as satisfactory
I mean; though, of course, very different. The question is, how
should one educate them. The present method seems to me abominable.
This girl, though twenty-four, had never heard that men desired
women, and, until I explained it, did not know how children were
born. Her ignorance upon other matters as important" (here Mrs.
Ambrose's letter may not be quoted) . . . "was complete. It seems
to me not merely foolish but criminal to bring people up like
that. Let alone the suffering to them, it explains why women are
what they are&mdash;the wonder is they're no worse. I have taken it
upon myself to enlighten her, and now, though still a good deal
prejudiced and liable to exaggerate, she is more or less a reasonable
human being. Keeping them ignorant, of course, defeats its own
object, and when they begin to understand they take it all much
too seriously. My brother-in-law really deserved a catastrophe&mdash;which
he won't get. I now pray for a young man to come to my help; some
one, I mean, who would talk to her openly, and prove how absurd
most of her ideas about life are. Unluckily such men seem almost
as rare as the women. The English colony certainly doesn't provide
one; artists, merchants, cultivated people&mdash;they are stupid, conventional,
and flirtatious. . . ." She ceased, and with her pen in her hand
sat looking into the fire, making the logs into caves and mountains,
for it had grown too dark to go on writing. Moreover, the house
began to stir as the hour of dinner approached; she could hear
the plates being chinked in the dining-room next door, and Chailey
instructing the Spanish girl where to put things down in vigorous
English. The bell rang; she rose, met Ridley and Rachel outside,
and they all went in to dinner.</p>

<p>Three months had made but little difference in the appearance
either of Ridley or Rachel; yet a keen observer might have thought
that the girl was more definite and self-confident in her manner
than before. Her skin was brown, her eyes certainly brighter,
and she attended to what was said as though she might be going
to contradict it. The meal began with the comfortable silence
of people who are quite at their ease together. Then Ridley, leaning
on his elbow and looking out of the window, observed that it was
a lovely night.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Helen. She added, "The season's begun," looking at
the lights beneath them. She asked Maria in Spanish whether the
hotel was not filling up with visitors. Maria informed her with
pride that there would come a time when it was positively difficult
to buy eggs&mdash;the shopkeepers would not mind what prices they asked;
they would get them, at any rate, from the English.</p>

<p>"That's an English steamer in the bay," said Rachel, looking
at a triangle of lights below. "She came in early this morning."</p>

<p>"Then we may hope for some letters and send ours back," said
Helen.</p>

<p>For some reason the mention of letters always made Ridley groan,
and the rest of the meal passed in a brisk argument between husband
and wife as to whether he was or was not wholly ignored by the
entire civilised world.</p>

<p>"Considering the last batch," said Helen, "you deserve beating.
You were asked to lecture, you were offered a degree, and some
silly woman praised not only your books but your beauty&mdash;she said
he was what Shelley would have been if Shelley had lived to fifty-five
and grown a beard. Really, Ridley, I think you're the vainest
man I know," she ended, rising from the table, "which I may tell
you is saying a good deal."</p>

<p>Finding her letter lying before the fire she added a few lines
to it, and then announced that she was going to take the letters
now &mdash;Ridley must bring his&mdash;and Rachel?</p>

<p>"I hope you've written to your Aunts? It's high time."</p>

<p>The women put on cloaks and hats, and after inviting Ridley to
come with them, which he emphatically refused to do, exclaiming
that Rachel he expected to be a fool, but Helen surely knew better,
they turned to go. He stood over the fire gazing into the depths
of the looking-glass, and compressing his face into the likeness
of a commander surveying a field of battle, or a martyr watching
the flames lick his toes, rather than that of a secluded Professor.</p>

<p>Helen laid hold of his beard.</p>

<p>"Am I a fool?" she said.</p>

<p>"Let me go, Helen."</p>

<p>"Am I a fool?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Vile woman!" he exclaimed, and kissed her.</p>

<p>"We'll leave you to your vanities," she called back as they went
out of the door.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening, still light enough to see a long
way down the road, though the stars were coming out. The pillar-box
was let into a high yellow wall where the lane met the road, and
having dropped the letters into it, Helen was for turning back.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Rachel, taking her by the wrist. "We're going
to see life. You promised."</p>

<p>"Seeing life" was the phrase they used for their habit of strolling
through the town after dark. The social life of Santa Marina was
carried on almost entirely by lamp-light, which the warmth of
the nights and the scents culled from flowers made pleasant enough.
The young women, with their hair magnificently swept in coils,
a red flower behind the ear, sat on the doorsteps, or issued out
on to balconies, while the young men ranged up and down beneath,
shouting up a greeting from time to time and stopping here and
there to enter into amorous talk. At the open windows merchants
could be seen making up the day's account, and older women lifting
jars from shelf to shelf. The streets were full of people, men
for the most part, who interchanged their views of the world as
they walked, or gathered round the wine-tables at the street corner,
where an old cripple was twanging his guitar strings, while a
poor girl cried her passionate song in the gutter. The two Englishwomen
excited some friendly curiosity, but no one molested them.</p>

<p>Helen sauntered on, observing the different people in their shabby
clothes, who seemed so careless and so natural, with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Just think of the Mall to-night!" she exclaimed at length. "It's
the fifteenth of March. Perhaps there's a Court." She thought
of the crowd waiting in the cold spring air to see the grand carriages
go by. "It's very cold, if it's not raining," she said. "First
there are men selling picture postcards; then there are wretched
little shop-girls with round bandboxes; then there are bank clerks
in tail coats; and then&mdash;any number of dressmakers. People from
South Kensington drive up in a hired fly; officials have a pair
of bays; earls, on the other hand, are allowed one footman to
stand up behind; dukes have two, royal dukes&mdash;so I was told&mdash;have
three; the king, I suppose, can have as many as he likes. And
the people believe in it!"</p>

<p>Out here it seemed as though the people of England must be shaped
in the body like the kings and queens, knights and pawns of the
chessboard, so strange were their differences, so marked and so
implicitly believed in.</p>

<p>They had to part in order to circumvent a crowd.</p>

<p>"They believe in God," said Rachel as they regained each other.
She meant that the people in the crowd believed in Him; for she
remembered the crosses with bleeding plaster figures that stood
where foot-paths joined, and the inexplicable mystery of a service
in a Roman Catholic church.</p>

<p>"We shall never understand!" she sighed.</p>

<p>They had walked some way and it was now night, but they could
see a large iron gate a little way farther down the road on their
left.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to go right up to the hotel?" Helen asked.</p>

<p>Rachel gave the gate a push; it swung open, and, seeing no one
about and judging that nothing was private in this country, they
walked straight on. An avenue of trees ran along the road, which
was completely straight. The trees suddenly came to an end; the
road turned a corner, and they found themselves confronted by
a large square building. They had come out upon the broad terrace
which ran round the hotel and were only a few feet distant from
the windows. A row of long windows opened almost to the ground.
They were all of them uncurtained, and all brilliantly lighted,
so that they could see everything inside. Each window revealed
a different section of the life of the hotel. They drew into one
of the broad columns of shadow which separated the windows and
gazed in. They found themselves just outside the dining-room.
It was being swept; a waiter was eating a bunch of grapes with
his leg across the corner of a table. Next door was the kitchen,
where they were washing up; white cooks were dipping their arms
into cauldrons, while the waiters made their meal voraciously
off broken meats, sopping up the gravy with bits of crumb. Moving
on, they became lost in a plantation of bushes, and then suddenly
found themselves outside the drawing-room, where the ladies and
gentlemen, having dined well, lay back in deep arm-chairs, occasionally
speaking or turning over the pages of magazines. A thin woman
was flourishing up and down the piano.</p>

<p>"What is a dahabeeyah, Charles?" the distinct voice of a widow,
seated in an arm-chair by the window, asked her son.</p>

<p>It was the end of the piece, and his answer was lost in the general
clearing of throats and tapping of knees.</p>

<p>"They're all old in this room," Rachel whispered.</p>

<p>Creeping on, they found that the next window revealed two men
in shirt-sleeves playing billiards with two young ladies.</p>

<p>"He pinched my arm!" the plump young woman cried, as she missed
her stroke.</p>

<p>"Now you two&mdash;no ragging," the young man with the red face reproved
them, who was marking.</p>

<p>"Take care or we shall be seen," whispered Helen, plucking Rachel
by the arm. Incautiously her head had risen to the middle of the
window.</p>

<p>Turning the corner they came to the largest room in the hotel,
which was supplied with four windows, and was called the Lounge,
although it was really a hall. Hung with armour and native embroideries,
furnished with divans and screens, which shut off convenient corners,
the room was less formal than the others, and was evidently the
haunt of youth. Signor Rodriguez, whom they knew to be the manager
of the hotel, stood quite near them in the doorway surveying the
scene&mdash;the gentlemen lounging in chairs, the couples leaning over
coffee-cups, the game of cards in the centre under profuse clusters
of electric light. He was congratulating himself upon the enterprise
which had turned the refectory, a cold stone room with pots on
trestles, into the most comfortable room in the house. The hotel
was very full, and proved his wisdom in decreeing that no hotel
can flourish without a lounge.</p>

<p>The people were scattered about in couples or parties of four,
and either they were actually better acquainted, or the informal
room made their manners easier. Through the open window came an
uneven humming sound like that which rises from a flock of sheep
pent within hurdles at dusk. The card-party occupied the centre
of the foreground.</p>

<p>Helen and Rachel watched them play for some minutes without being
able to distinguish a word. Helen was observing one of the men
intently. He was a lean, somewhat cadaverous man of about her
own age, whose profile was turned to them, and he was the partner
of a highly-coloured girl, obviously English by birth.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the strange way in which some words detach themselves
from the rest, they heard him say quite distinctly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"All you want is practice, Miss Warrington; courage and practice&mdash;one's
no good without the other."</p>

<p>"Hughling Elliot! Of course!" Helen exclaimed. She ducked her
head immediately, for at the sound of his name he looked up. The
game went on for a few minutes, and was then broken up by the
approach of a wheeled chair, containing a voluminous old lady
who paused by the table and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Better luck to-night, Susan?"</p>

<p>"All the luck's on our side," said a young man who until now
had kept his back turned to the window. He appeared to be rather
stout, and had a thick crop of hair.</p>

<p>"Luck, Mr. Hewet?" said his partner, a middle-aged lady with
spectacles. "I assure you, Mrs. Paley, our success is due solely
to our brilliant play."</p>

<p>"Unless I go to bed early I get practically no sleep at all,"
Mrs. Paley was heard to explain, as if to justify her seizure
of Susan, who got up and proceeded to wheel the chair to the door.</p>

<p>"They'll get some one else to take my place," she said cheerfully.
But she was wrong. No attempt was made to find another player,
and after the young man had built three stories of a card-house,
which fell down, the players strolled off in different directions.</p>

<p>Mr. Hewet turned his full face towards the window. They could
see that he had large eyes obscured by glasses; his complexion
was rosy, his lips clean-shaven; and, seen among ordinary people,
it appeared to be an interesting face. He came straight towards
them, but his eyes were fixed not upon the eavesdroppers but upon
a spot where the curtain hung in folds.</p>

<p>"Asleep?" he said.</p>

<p>Helen and Rachel started to think that some one had been sitting
near to them unobserved all the time. There were legs in the shadow.
A melancholy voice issued from above them.</p>

<p>"Two women," it said.</p>

<p>A scuffling was heard on the gravel. The women had fled. They
did not stop running until they felt certain that no eye could
penetrate the darkness and the hotel was only a square shadow
in the distance, with red holes regularly cut in it.</p>
