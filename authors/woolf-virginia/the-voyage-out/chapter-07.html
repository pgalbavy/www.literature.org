<p>From a distance the <em>Euphrosyne</em> looked very small. Glasses
were turned upon her from the decks of great liners, and she was
pronounced a tramp, a cargo-boat, or one of those wretched little
passenger steamers where people rolled about among the cattle
on deck. The insect-like figures of Dalloways, Ambroses, and Vinraces
were also derided, both from the extreme smallness of their persons
and the doubt which only strong glasses could dispel as to whether
they were really live creatures or only lumps on the rigging.
Mr. Pepper with all his learning had been mistaken for a cormorant,
and then, as unjustly, transformed into a cow. At night, indeed,
when the waltzes were swinging in the saloon, and gifted passengers
reciting, the little ship&mdash;shrunk to a few beads of light out
among the dark waves, and one high in air upon the mast-head&mdash;seemed
something mysterious and impressive to heated partners resting
from the dance. She became a ship passing in the night&mdash;an emblem
of the loneliness of human life, an occasion for queer confidences
and sudden appeals for sympathy.</p>

<p>On and on she went, by day and by night, following her path,
until one morning broke and showed the land. Losing its shadow-like
appearance it became first cleft and mountainous, next coloured
grey and purple, next scattered with white blocks which gradually
separated themselves, and then, as the progress of the ship acted
upon the view like a field-glass of increasing power, became streets
of houses. By nine o'clock the <em>Euphrosyne</em> had taken up
her position in the middle of a great bay; she dropped her anchor;
immediately, as if she were a recumbent giant requiring examination,
small boats came swarming about her. She rang with cries; men
jumped on to her; her deck was thumped by feet. The lonely little
island was invaded from all quarters at once, and after four weeks
of silence it was bewildering to hear human speech. Mrs. Ambrose
alone heeded none of this stir. She was pale with suspense while
the boat with mail bags was making towards them. Absorbed in her
letters she did not notice that she had left the <em>Euphrosyne</em>,
and felt no sadness when the ship lifted up her voice and bellowed
thrice like a cow separated from its calf.</p>

<p>"The children are well!" she exclaimed. Mr. Pepper, who sat opposite
with a great mound of bag and rug upon his knees, said, "Gratifying."
Rachel, to whom the end of the voyage meant a complete change
of perspective, was too much bewildered by the approach of the
shore to realise what children were well or why it was gratifying.
Helen went on reading.</p>

<p>Moving very slowly, and rearing absurdly high over each wave,
the little boat was now approaching a white crescent of sand.
Behind this was a deep green valley, with distinct hills on either
side. On the slope of the right-hand hill white houses with brown
roofs were settled, like nesting sea-birds, and at intervals cypresses
striped the hill with black bars. Mountains whose sides were flushed
with red, but whose crowns were bald, rose as a pinnacle, half-concealing
another pinnacle behind it. The hour being still early, the whole
view was exquisitely light and airy; the blues and greens of sky
and tree were intense but not sultry. As they drew nearer and
could distinguish details, the effect of the earth with its minute
objects and colours and different forms of life was overwhelming
after four weeks of the sea, and kept them silent.</p>

<p>"Three hundred years odd," said Mr. Pepper meditatively at length.</p>

<p>As nobody said, "What?" he merely extracted a bottle and swallowed
a pill. The piece of information that died within him was to the
effect that three hundred years ago five Elizabethan barques had
anchored where the <em>Euphrosyne</em> now floated. Half-drawn
up upon the beach lay an equal number of Spanish galleons, unmanned,
for the country was still a virgin land behind a veil. Slipping
across the water, the English sailors bore away bars of silver,
bales of linen, timbers of cedar wood, golden crucifixes knobbed
with emeralds. When the Spaniards came down from their drinking,
a fight ensued, the two parties churning up the sand, and driving
each other into the surf. The Spaniards, bloated with fine living
upon the fruits of the miraculous land, fell in heaps; but the
hardy Englishmen, tawny with sea-voyaging, hairy for lack of razors,
with muscles like wire, fangs greedy for flesh, and fingers itching
for gold, despatched the wounded, drove the dying into the sea,
and soon reduced the natives to a state of superstitious wonderment.
Here a settlement was made; women were imported; children grew.
All seemed to favour the expansion of the British Empire, and
had there been men like Richard Dalloway in the time of Charles
the First, the map would undoubtedly be red where it is now an
odious green. But it must be supposed that the political mind
of that age lacked imagination, and, merely for want of a few
thousand pounds and a few thousand men, the spark died that should
have been a conflagration. From the interior came Indians with
subtle poisons, naked bodies, and painted idols; from the sea
came vengeful Spaniards and rapacious Portuguese; exposed to all
these enemies (though the climate proved wonderfully kind and
the earth abundant) the English dwindled away and all but disappeared.
Somewhere about the middle of the seventeenth century a single
sloop watched its season and slipped out by night, bearing within
it all that was left of the great British colony, a few men, a
few women, and perhaps a dozen dusky children. English history
then denies all knowledge of the place. Owing to one cause and
another civilisation shifted its centre to a spot some four or
five hundred miles to the south, and to-day Santa Marina is not
much larger than it was three hundred years ago. In population
it is a happy compromise, for Portuguese fathers wed Indian mothers,
and their children intermarry with the Spanish. Although they
get their ploughs from Manchester, they make their coats from
their own sheep, their silk from their own worms, and their furniture
from their own cedar trees, so that in arts and industries the
place is still much where it was in Elizabethan days.</p>

<p>The reasons which had drawn the English across the sea to found
a small colony within the last ten years are not so easily described,
and will never perhaps be recorded in history books. Granted facility
of travel, peace, good trade, and so on, there was besides a kind
of dissatisfaction among the English with the older countries
and the enormous accumulations of carved stone, stained glass,
and rich brown painting which they offered to the tourist. The
movement in search of something new was of course infinitely small,
affecting only a handful of well-to-do people. It began by a few
schoolmasters serving their passage out to South America as the
pursers of tramp steamers. They returned in time for the summer
term, when their stories of the splendours and hardships of life
at sea, the humours of sea-captains, the wonders of night and
dawn, and the marvels of the place delighted outsiders, and sometimes
found their way into print. The country itself taxed all their
powers of description, for they said it was much bigger than Italy,
and really nobler than Greece. Again, they declared that the natives
were strangely beautiful, very big in stature, dark, passionate,
and quick to seize the knife. The place seemed new and full of
new forms of beauty, in proof of which they showed handkerchiefs
which the women had worn round their heads, and primitive carvings
coloured bright greens and blues. Somehow or other, as fashions
do, the fashion spread; an old monastery was quickly turned into
a hotel, while a famous line of steamships altered its route for
the convenience of passengers.</p>

<p>Oddly enough it happened that the least satisfactory of Helen
Ambrose's brothers had been sent out years before to make his
fortune, at any rate to keep clear of race-horses, in the very
spot which had now become so popular. Often, leaning upon the
column in the verandah, he had watched the English ships with
English schoolmasters for pursers steaming into the bay. Having
at length earned enough to take a holiday, and being sick of the
place, he proposed to put his villa, on the slope of the mountain,
at his sister's disposal. She, too, had been a little stirred
by the talk of a new world, where there was always sun and never
a fog, which went on around her, and the chance, when they were
planning where to spend the winter out of England, seemed too
good to be missed. For these reasons she determined to accept
Willoughby's offer of free passages on his ship, to place the
children with their grand-parents, and to do the thing thoroughly
while she was about it.</p>

<p>Taking seats in a carriage drawn by long-tailed horses with pheasants'
feathers erect between their ears, the Ambroses, Mr. Pepper, and
Rachel rattled out of the harbour. The day increased in heat as
they drove up the hill. The road passed through the town, where
men seemed to be beating brass and crying "Water," where the passage
was blocked by mules and cleared by whips and curses, where the
women walked barefoot, their heads balancing baskets, and cripples
hastily displayed mutilated members; it issued among steep green
fields, not so green but that the earth showed through. Great
trees now shaded all but the centre of the road, and a mountain
stream, so shallow and so swift that it plaited itself into strands
as it ran, raced along the edge. Higher they went, until Ridley
and Rachel walked behind; next they turned along a lane scattered
with stones, where Mr. Pepper raised his stick and silently indicated
a shrub, bearing among sparse leaves a voluminous purple blossom;
and at a rickety canter the last stage of the way was accomplished.</p>

<p>The villa was a roomy white house, which, as is the case with
most continental houses, looked to an English eye frail, ramshackle,
and absurdly frivolous, more like a pagoda in a tea-garden than
a place where one slept. The garden called urgently for the services
of gardener. Bushes waved their branches across the paths, and
the blades of grass, with spaces of earth between them, could
be counted. In the circular piece of ground in front of the verandah
were two cracked vases, from which red flowers drooped, with a
stone fountain between them, now parched in the sun. The circular
garden led to a long garden, where the gardener's shears had scarcely
been, unless now and then, when he cut a bough of blossom for
his beloved. A few tall trees shaded it, and round bushes with
wax-like flowers mobbed their heads together in a row. A garden
smoothly laid with turf, divided by thick hedges, with raised
beds of bright flowers, such as we keep within walls in England,
would have been out of place upon the side of this bare hill.
There was no ugliness to shut out, and the villa looked straight
across the shoulder of a slope, ribbed with olive trees, to the
sea.</p>

<p>The indecency of the whole place struck Mrs. Chailey forcibly.
There were no blinds to shut out the sun, nor was there any furniture
to speak of for the sun to spoil. Standing in the bare stone hall,
and surveying a staircase of superb breadth, but cracked and carpetless,
she further ventured the opinion that there were rats, as large
as terriers at home, and that if one put one's foot down with
any force one would come through the floor. As for hot water&mdash;at
this point her investigations left her speechless.</p>

<p>"Poor creature!" she murmured to the sallow Spanish servant-girl
who came out with the pigs and hens to receive them, "no wonder
you hardly look like a human being!" Maria accepted the compliment
with an exquisite Spanish grace. In Chailey's opinion they would
have done better to stay on board an English ship, but none knew
better than she that her duty commanded her to stay.</p>

<p>When they were settled in, and in train to find daily occupation,
there was some speculation as to the reasons which induced Mr.
Pepper to stay, taking up his lodging in the Ambroses' house.
Efforts had been made for some days before landing to impress
upon him the advantages of the Amazons.</p>

<p>"That great stream!" Helen would begin, gazing as if she saw
a visionary cascade, "I've a good mind to go with you myself,
Willoughby&mdash;only I can't. Think of the sunsets and the moonrises
&mdash;I believe the colours are unimaginable."</p>

<p>"There are wild peacocks," Rachel hazarded.</p>

<p>"And marvellous creatures in the water," Helen asserted.</p>

<p>"One might discover a new reptile," Rachel continued.</p>

<p>"There's certain to be a revolution, I'm told," Helen urged.</p>

<p>The effect of these subterfuges was a little dashed by Ridley,
who, after regarding Pepper for some moments, sighed aloud, "Poor
fellow!" and inwardly speculated upon the unkindness of women.</p>

<p>He stayed, however, in apparent contentment for six days, playing
with a microscope and a notebook in one of the many sparsely furnished
sitting-rooms, but on the evening of the seventh day, as they
sat at dinner, he appeared more restless than usual. The dinner-table
was set between two long windows which were left uncurtained by
Helen's orders. Darkness fell as sharply as a knife in this climate,
and the town then sprang out in circles and lines of bright dots
beneath them. Buildings which never showed by day showed by night,
and the sea flowed right over the land judging by the moving lights
of the steamers. The sight fulfilled the same purpose as an orchestra
in a London restaurant, and silence had its setting. William Pepper
observed it for some time; he put on his spectacles to contemplate
the scene.</p>

<p>"I've identified the big block to the left," he observed, and
pointed with his fork at a square formed by several rows of lights.</p>

<p>"One should infer that they can cook vegetables," he added.</p>

<p>"An hotel?" said Helen.</p>

<p>"Once a monastery," said Mr. Pepper.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said then, but, the day after, Mr. Pepper returned
from a midday walk, and stood silently before Helen who was reading
in the verandah.</p>

<p>"I've taken a room over there," he said.</p>

<p>"You're not going?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"On the whole&mdash;yes," he remarked. "No private cook <em>can</em>
cook vegetables."</p>

<p>Knowing his dislike of questions, which she to some extent shared,
Helen asked no more. Still, an uneasy suspicion lurked in her
mind that William was hiding a wound. She flushed to think that
her words, or her husband's, or Rachel's had penetrated and stung.
She was half-moved to cry, "Stop, William; explain!" and would
have returned to the subject at luncheon if William had not shown
himself inscrutable and chill, lifting fragments of salad on the
point of his fork, with the gesture of a man pronging seaweed,
detecting gravel, suspecting germs.</p>

<p>"If you all die of typhoid I won't be responsible!" he snapped.</p>

<p>"If you die of dulness, neither will I," Helen echoed in her
heart.</p>

<p>She reflected that she had never yet asked him whether he had
been in love. They had got further and further from that subject
instead of drawing nearer to it, and she could not help feeling
it a relief when William Pepper, with all his knowledge, his microscope,
his note-books, his genuine kindliness and good sense, but a certain
dryness of soul, took his departure. Also she could not help feeling
it sad that friendships should end thus, although in this case
to have the room empty was something of a comfort, and she tried
to console herself with the reflection that one never knows how
far other people feel the things they might be supposed to feel.</p>
