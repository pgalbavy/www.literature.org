<p>Despite the alarm caused by the sudden illness of Mrs. Whitney,
it was quickly apparent that nothing serious was the matter with
her.</p>

<p>She had succumbed temporarily to the intense strain to which
she had been subjected, and, under the considerate attention shown
her, speedily rallied, declaring herself, within five minutes
after the departure of Vesey, as well as ever.</p>

<p>"No one can rejoice more than I," observed Capt. Asbury; "and,
since it is so trifling, you will not misunderstand me when I
say that your illness seems to have been providential."</p>

<p>Fred and the rest looked inquiringly at the leader.</p>

<p>"The man who was here has gone back with the report of what he
saw, and I think my words will cause him to represent the case&mdash;well,"
added the captain, with a smile, "as it appeared at that moment.
That will secure further delay."</p>

<p>"But what can it all amount to?" asked Fred in turn; "they may
give you a half-hour or so, but that does not count."</p>

<p>"If your estimable mother could manage to&mdash;ah&mdash;look desperately
ill when the messenger returns, why, it might help matters."</p>

<p>But the good woman shook her head. Appreciating the gravity of
the situation, she could not be a party to such a deception, even
though beneficent results might follow.</p>

<p>"He saw me as I was, and thus he must see me when he comes again.
My conscience would not permit it otherwise."</p>

<p>"You are right, Mrs. Whitney, and I beg your pardon," replied
the captain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Monteith Sterry was thinking hard. Begging the indulgence
of the others, he drew Capt. Asbury aside.</p>

<p>"I have decided upon an attempt," said he abruptly, "which you
must not forbid, even though your judgment may condemn it."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I am going to try to get away."</p>

<p>"How?" was the surprised question; "what chance have you of succeeding,
when every side of the house is watched?"</p>

<p>"Vesey told me, just as he was leaving, that he was not allowed
to take his place as guard at the stables, which explains why
he failed to give me the signal."</p>

<p>"He is unaware of what Miss Whitney has done?"</p>

<p>"I do not know of a surety, for he made no reference to it, but
you heard his remark, which indicates that he is ignorant."</p>

<p>"Sterry," said the captain impressively, "the only friend you
have among the rustlers is that same Vesey, and I place less faith
in him than you do; yet you propose this wild scheme, without
even the doubtful help of that man, and still expect me to approve
it."</p>

<p>"You put it truthfully; I will only say that in the darkness
I hope to be taken for one of them."</p>

<p>"And if you are?"</p>

<p>"I will work my way beyond the lines, and then make for the camp
of the stockmen."</p>

<p>"On foot or horseback?"</p>

<p>"I can hardly expect to obtain a horse, but let me once gain
the chance, and I will show some sprinting."</p>

<p>"You ignore the services of Miss Whitney?"</p>

<p>"It was a brave and characteristic deed, but a woman acts from
intuition rather than reason. There is not a shadow of hope that
she will accomplish anything."</p>

<p>"In my judgment, the prospect is as favourable for her as for
you."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Sterry, "I rather expected you to talk that way,
so your condemnation is discounted. I intend to pass out of the
rear door within the next three minutes; I wish you to hold it,
ready to open in the event of my deciding on a hasty return. If
such return does not follow in the course of a quarter of an hour,
you may conclude that I won't be back."</p>

<p>"I have already concluded that," was the significant comment.</p>

<p>The candle diffused enough illumination to show the anxious faces
turned toward the couple as they walked back from the corner to
which they had withdrawn for their brief consultation.</p>

<p>In the fewest words possible the captain explained the decision
of the young man. He frankly stated that he did not believe there
was any hope of success, but Sterry was firm in his resolution,
and he would not interpose his authority. Fred Whitney was about
to protest, but the expression of his friend's face showed that
it would be useless, and he forebore.</p>

<p>Mont peered through the window, near the rear door, and, so far
as he could judge, everything was favourable. Then he faced about,
smiled, and without a word waved his friends good-by.</p>

<p>The door was drawn inward just enough to permit the passage of
his body, and the next instant he had vanished.</p>

<p>Capt. Asbury sprang to the window and looked after him, but quick
as he was, the time was sufficient for the youth to disappear
as completely as though he were a dozen miles distant.</p>

<p>"If I may be allowed," said the captain, in his most suave manner,
"I would suggest, Mr. Whitney, that you assist your mother to
her apartment up stairs. She is in need of rest, and can obtain
it there much better than here."</p>

<p>The good woman glanced suspiciously at the man, half doubting
the disinterestedness of his counsel, but he looked so grave and
solicitous that she was sure she did him injustice. While she
was hesitating, Fred added:</p>

<p>"It is good advice, mother; you can lie down, and when it is
necessary I will call you. Come, please."</p>

<p>She could not decline, and the stalwart son, who seemed to have
forgotten all about his wounded arm, almost carried her up the
short stairs and to her room. He was so familiar with the interior
that he needed no light, and deposited her as gently as an infant
on the bed, kissed her an affectionate good-night, and promised
to listen and come to her on hearing the slightest movement in
her apartment.</p>

<p>"How does she seem to be?" asked Capt. Asbury, as Fred came down
the stairs.</p>

<p>"As well as ever; but the little rest will be grateful. She has
had enough to try the strongest person within the last few days."</p>

<p>"True indeed. I presume Vesey will soon be back with some ugly
message from Inman and Cadmus, but we have delayed matters so
long that I'm hopeful of keeping it up a while longer. Suppose,
when this enterprising rustler shows himself, you allow me to
do the talking, Fred. There is a good deal, you know, in the way
you put things."</p>

<p>"I understand," replied the other, with a smile. "It will come,
perhaps, more appropriately from you than me."</p>

<p>It was apparent from the manner of the captain that he felt considerable
hope of success through the efforts of Miss Whitney or Sterry,
or both. Time was the great factor. It would seem that three or
four hours ought to bring the cattlemen, if either of the messengers
succeeded in getting through the lines. While there was little
doubt of the ability of the besieged being able to stand off their
assailants for a much longer time, yet there was every reason
to strain to the utmost the fortunate delay already secured.</p>

<p>A conflict was certain to result in a number of deaths to each
side. Not only that, but it would intensify the bitterness already
prevailing through many portions of Wyoming and Montana between
the cowmen and rustlers, and postpone and increase the difficulty
of the adjustment of the quarrel.</p>

<p>A full half-hour passed, during which the captain kept his place
at the rear door, ready to admit Sterry should he make a dash
for it. He did not appear, and when the fastenings of the structure
were returned to their place the leader's heart was more hopeful
than ever. He had just made a remark to that effect when a knocking
was heard again on the front door, accompanied by Duke Vesey's
announcement that it was himself who claimed admission.</p>

<p>The captain drew back the fastenings and the rustler stepped
inside, his face showing great agitation.</p>

<p>"This is a fine state of things," he said, addressing young Whitney,
Hawkridge and the captain.</p>

<p>"To what do you refer?" asked Whitney.</p>

<p>"You sent Mont Sterry out awhile ago, and the rustlers have caught
him; he's in their hands and will be shot at daybreak. Capt. Inman
sent me to you with that message, and to say that the fight will
open in a few minutes. You can't play your tricks any longer on
us."</p>

<p>It was apparent that Duke Vesey was in a rage over the mishap
that had befallen his friend.</p>

<p>Capt. Asbury quietly placed himself between the fellow and the
door by which he had entered.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of that?" demanded the rustler, turning
his head; "I'm here under a flag of truce."</p>

<p>"Where is it? You haven't shown any, and you can't. I shall hold
you as a hostage for the safety of Mont Sterry; whatever harm
is visited upon <em>him</em> shall descend upon <em>your</em>
head!"</p>
