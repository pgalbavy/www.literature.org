"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he landed his crew with care;<br/>
Supporting each man on the top of the tide<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a finger entwined in his hair.

</p>
<p>
"Just the place for a Snark!  I have said it twice:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That alone should encourage the crew.<br/>
Just the place for a Snark!  I have said it thrice:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I tell you three times is true."

</p>
<p>
The crew was complete: it included a Boots&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maker of Bonnets and Hoods&mdash;<br/>
A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a Broker, to value their goods.

</p>
<p>
A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might perhaps have won more than his share&mdash;<br/>
But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the whole of their cash in his care.

</p>
<p>
There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or would sit making lace in the bow:<br/>
And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though none of the sailors knew how.

</p>
<p>
There was one who was famed for the number of things<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forgot when he entered the ship:<br/>
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the clothes he had bought for the trip.

</p>
<p>
He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his name painted clearly on each:<br/>
But, since he omitted to mention the fact,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were all left behind on the beach.

</p>
<p>
The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had seven coats on when he came,<br/>
With three pairs of boots&mdash;but the worst of it was,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had wholly forgotten his name.

</p>
<p>
He would answer to "Hi!" or to any loud cry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as "Fry me!" or "Fritter my wig!"<br/>
&nbsp;To "What-you-may-call-um!" or "What-was-his-name!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But especially "Thing-um-a-jig!"

</p>
<p>
While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had different names from these:<br/>
His intimate friends called him "Candle-ends,"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his enemies "Toasted-cheese."

</p>
<p>
"His form is ungainly&mdash;his intellect small&mdash;"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(So the Bellman would often remark)<br/>
"But his courage is perfect!  And that, after all,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the thing that one needs with a Snark."

</p>
<p>
He would joke with hyenas, returning their stare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an impudent wag of the head:<br/>
And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just to keep up its spirits," he said.

</p>
<p>
He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad&mdash;<br/>
He could only bake Bridecake&mdash;for which, I may state,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No materials were to be had.

</p>
<p>
The last of the crew needs especial remark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he looked an incredible dunce:<br/>
He had just one idea&mdash;but, that one being "Snark,"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good Bellman engaged him at once.

</p>
<p>
He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ship had been sailing a week,<br/>
He could only kill Beavers.  The Bellman looked scared,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was almost too frightened to speak:

</p>
<p>
But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only one Beaver on board;<br/>
And that was a tame one he had of his own,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose death would be deeply deplored.

</p>
<p>
The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protested, with tears in its eyes,<br/>
That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could atone for that dismal surprise!

</p>
<p>
It strongly advised that the Butcher should be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conveyed in a separate ship:<br/>
But the Bellman declared that would never agree<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the plans he had made for the trip:

</p>
<p>
Navigation was always a difficult art,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though with only one ship and one bell:<br/>
And he feared he must really decline, for his part,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undertaking another as well.

</p>
<p>
The Beaverâ€™s best course was, no doubt, to procure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second-hand dagger-proof coat&mdash;<br/>
So the Baker advised it&mdash;and next, to insure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its life in some Office of note:

</p>
<p>
This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(On moderate terms), or for sale,<br/>
Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one Against Damage From Hail.

</p>
<p>
Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the Butcher was by,<br/>
The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And appeared unaccountably shy.<br/>
